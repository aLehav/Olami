After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you accuse someone of something, you have to prove your allegations. When you want to change the status quo, you have to convince people why your new way of thinking is better. Whether you think your conclusion should already be obvious to people or not, you have the burden of proof.
That’s why I don’t understand antagonism towards those who ask to be educated about racism, sexism, and all the other “-isms” that afflict marginalized people. In the past few years, we have made great progress against these social problems, even taking into account all the backlash against it. But many of the people who want their voices to be heard for things to change are abandoning their roles. They write books titled “Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race” and articles titled “Feminists are not responsible for educating men.”
It’s understandable if someone is being insulting or threatening. No one should feel obligated to stay and deal with them. However, I’ve heard some people say, “It’s not my job to educate you” or express similar sentiments—less as a legitimate defense against trolls, and more as a cop-out when engaging with curious, well-meaning people who happen to not have marginalized identities. I think this is the most self-defeating strategy that marginalized people can adopt.
It’s easy to say, “It’s not my job to educate you.” That statement is true, after all. But just because it’s not one’s job doesn’t mean one shouldn’t do it. Talking to a possibly skeptical audience is an opportunity to hone one’s positions and to genuinely convince someone. Yes, it’s hard, exhausting, and often futile. But the alternative—not doing anything—is much worse.
If you don’t take the opportunity to teach someone else about your identity, you just give it away to Google. Now, the Internet can be a starting place for learning. For example, when applying for jobs, one often looks up a company beforehand to sound informed during an interview. Similarly, when one want to learn more about others’ experiences and beliefs, one should do some research beforehand. It’s easy enough.
But the Internet is also littered with misinformation and deception. Even in instances where that’s not the case, an online article or YouTube video can never replace the experience of learning from a human being. For those saying that people who don’t share your identity can’t understand your experiences, at least sharing them is better than driving others down Internet rabbit holes.
One argument of those who say “It’s not my job” is that they have already educated people too many times, said the same things too many times. So they accuse people of not having learned already. But people who in good faith ask you to help them understand are not an “oppressors,” even if their “privilege” has shielded them from previously having needed to have these conversations. Why quibble over people's pasts when you can help them develop the educated opinion you want them to have? They won’t get there any other way. Yes, maybe conversations will fail. People might be too naïve, or get too defensive, or reveal that they’re uninterested in what you have to say. But you won’t know until you engage.
People who complain about educating want to skip steps. They want to wake up in a world where everyone already understands and doesn’t need to ask. But we don’t live in that world yet. It has to be made. Those who are in power clearly won’t enact change, so we have to change things ourselves. And we are going to need allies.
This doesn’t mean you always have to be the spokesperson for your marginalized identity. As a former teacher used to tell my class with increasing frequency after President Donald J. Trump was elected, you always have the power to decline to have the conversation. No one’s always ready to answer hard questions and get personal, especially around painfully personal topics. Ultimately, we’re all human beings who are allowed to say no just because we don’t feel like talking today.
But if you opt out of a conversation, then you have to accept the consequences. Namely, you can’t get mad when it turns out that people still do not understand that which you wanted them to grasp. If you were in a position to change things, and you didn’t take it, it’s not their fault.
No, it’s not your job to educate. It shouldn’t be treated as one anyway—quite literally, it’s not something you do to pay the bills, even though it may not excite you. It’s something you do because you want more people to understand your views, to create a more equal world. It’s what you, as a marginalized person who wants to change things for people with that marginalized identity, are in a unique position to do. Educating people is your prerogative.
Dare I even call it a privilege?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With speculation about Harvard’s next president abounding, some experts monitoring the presidential search have argued that candidates already affiliated with the University have a leg up on the competition. Harvard has historically promoted from within its own ranks, and since the early 1900s, only one president has not held an administrative or faculty position at the University before assuming its top role. This practice certainly comes with its own drawbacks, and we appreciate the arguments for new perspectives to drive the University forward. Nevertheless, we believe that—with perhaps a few exceptions—the complex and dynamic responsibilities of the next president make it unwise to deviate from the current trend.
There are real and important advantages to selecting an internal candidate. Individuals already heavily involved in the day-to-day life of the University likely have a greater knowledge of Harvard’s unique administrative quirks and internal politics. They would enter the job prepared to navigate Harvard’s unique ecosystem and enact new policies as efficiently as possible.
Especially at this moment in Harvard’s history, with the University facing a host of pressing issues—including new taxes on its endowment, ongoing controversy over sanctions on unrecognized social organizations, and debates over faculty diversity—Harvard’s next president must be prepared to hit the ground running on their first day in office. We have previously opined on the need for a smooth transition. An internal candidate is more likely to be well-versed on each of these complex and nuanced conversations, enabling them to steer the University forward.
Promoting from within is also an effective strategy to inspire Harvard administrators and professors to stay with the University in the long term. In particular, as more educators across the country are being forced into temporary “in-residence” and “visiting” positions, we urge Harvard to provide clear pathways to greater leadership and influence on campus for its faculty in order to retain and cultivate talent.
Still, the search committee should not unnecessarily winnow their pool of talent by refusing to consider outside candidates. Not all past presidents, even with previous positions within the University, have had impeccable track records during their tenures. If an outsider is to be seriously considered, however, the searchers should carefully scrutinize the candidate's prior demonstrated ability to jump into a new role. The searchers should therefore consider internal and qualified external candidates in compiling their shortlist, while bearing in mind the necessity for a quick learner and talented listener, able to intimately understand Harvard’s unique dilemmas and strengths.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

My favorite “shithole”—in the words of President Donald Trump—is El Salvador. It is a country of more than 6 million people squeezed into 8,000 square miles. In rural San Vicente, on the farm where my mother grew up, the sky is so clear and devoid of pollution that stars shine brightly. Textbook descriptions of the Milky Way make sense, as one looks up to see one star stacked upon another, endlessly. El Salvador is founded on the Nahuat state of Cuzcatlan, indigenous lands that have produced artists, thinkers, and poets who’ve given the world handbooks for achieving social justice. One of the country’s most important poets wrote, “I believe the world is beautiful / and that poetry, like bread, is for everyone.”
But, the U.S.’s biggest headlines involving El Salvador are extremely narrow in scope. Attorney General Jeff Sessions visited in July to meet with Salvadoran law enforcement officials about gang violence. It’s the country to which politicians claim they are going to deport all gang members of MS-13. Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans who’ve lived in the United States for more than 20 years are losing legal status. Meanwhile, the president insinuated that El Salvador is a “shithole.”
People must be ignorant to believe that El Salvador is a place that is fully and unequivocally irredeemable. Ignorance is the soil in which white supremacy sinks its roots before becoming a full-fledged ideology. Ignorance reduces El Salvador to a “shithole,” and Harvard is doing very little to curb it.
Studying El Salvador at Harvard is difficult. The Salvadoran Civil War might occupy a week of a history syllabus. Salvadoran immigration may be mentioned in passing. But taking a class solely focused on El Salvador—or Central America as a whole—is impossible. This is largely because Harvard still does not have a formalized Latinx Studies program. This academic gap presents both the problem and a potential solution.
Latinx Studies was first proposed at Harvard in 1972 as Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies. Since then, the field has drastically changed. While the 1972 proposal focused almost exclusively on Mexico and Puerto Rico, the field now includes scholarship on immigrants from a variety of Caribbean, Central American, and South American countries. Leading scholars’ understanding of the relationship between the United States and Latin America has dramatically evolved.
This presents a problem for establishing Latinx Studies on campus. It’s difficult to convince high-caliber Latinx studies scholars to come teach at Harvard when we have no department or clearly designated resources to support their work. At a panel last spring, I asked Asian American Studies scholar Lisa Lowe how to deal with the lack of infrastructure left by years of inaction. Her answer was simple: Harvard should try doing something new to deal with an ever-changing field.
Central American Studies could be this “something new” Harvard desperately needs. The field, as scholars Beth F. Baker and Ester E. Hernández write, is “an interdisciplinary field that bridges ethnic studies and area studies,” focusing on the region that includes countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Belize. The field itself is still developing.
The only Central American Studies department in the country, established in 2000, is at California State, Northridge. Scholarship in Central American Studies is happening at other universities, but often without much support. “[M]ost scholars focusing on US Central Americans have labored on their own without infrastructural support,” Baker and Hernandez write. “These teachers are breaking ground in their fields… and their own disciplines.”
This problem offers Harvard an opportunity. Even if Harvard were to establish a traditional Latinx Studies program, like the one that was founded in West Coast universities in the late ’60s (or Yale in 1982), it would not necessarily be attractive to academics comfortably settled in their own Latinx Studies programs. Central American scholars, on the other hand, are seeking institutions that are serious about supporting their scholarship. Harvard could be that institution.
If the funds were allocated for a Latinx Studies Center, with an explicit focus on innovative scholarship in Central American Studies, scholars would have motivation to bring their talents to Harvard. A cluster-hire of any number of leaders in the field to staff such a center—like the ones proposed in 1971, 1979, 1993, 2001, and 2005—would bring Latinx Studies to Harvard. Harvard could finally fill a gap they’ve had for decades, while also bringing together a cohort of scholars to embark on new, exciting scholarship the University could be proud of.
These new hires, combined with the handful of scholars already doing work in the field of Latinx studies at Harvard, would finally have a place with the space, resources, and support system to finally bring a robust program to campus. The future of Latinx Studies could be Central American Studies. More importantly, we could be creating that future at Harvard.
Two years ago, in the first piece I ever wrote for The Crimson, I made a critically incorrect assumption about Latinx Studies at Harvard. I wrote that, “Harvard can’t afford to fall behind now, and we won’t let it.” The sad truth is that Harvard has fallen 50 years behind. But as the United States grapples with Central American immigration, biculturalism, and the ugly presence of white supremacy, it’s critical that Harvard catch up. When it does, maybe we’ll have elected public servants who don’t think of nations like El Salvador as “shithole countries.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate students and faculty said fluctuating enrollments in the classes they teach can cause challenges for course staff, who often face uncertain schedules as a result of undergraduates shopping, adding, and dropping courses during the first weeks of the semester.
Psychology Professor Fiery A. Cushman said the beginning of the semester is often a chaotic time for him and his teaching staff.
“It’s a little bit of a scramble, because you’re trying to figure out exactly who your staff is going to be at the same time that you’re sectioning,” Cushman said.
Cushman teaches Psychology 15: “Social Psychology,” which had to add several sections this semester due to high enrollment. The class is tied for fifth most popular among undergraduates this semester. To handle increased interest in the course, Cushman said he began planning to hire an extra teaching fellow last week in coordination with Celia I. Raia, the psychology department’s graduate student coordinator.
“On Friday, when all the enrollment numbers came in, there were some classes in the department with lower than expected enrollment. So, there were some TFs, doctoral students in psychology, who were looking to be reassigned,” Cushman said. “I spent the past week reviewing CVs and laying out what the options were. And all of those people knew there was a chance that they could be called up from the bullpen to fill in.”
In many departments, mostly in the humanities and social sciences, Ph.D. candidates are guaranteed two sections of teaching assignments during each semester they are eligible to teach. These semesters often fall in the third and fourth years of their doctorate.
Many Ph.D. candidates take on teaching responsibilities because it is required in many degree programs. Yet more rely on on teaching appointments for to bolster their stipends.
Graduate students who need to find new assignments after undergraduates finalize their study cards have several options. They can contact administrators in their department to find last-minute openings or use the Centralized Application for Teaching Sections, a tool some departments use to post openings, according to the GSAS Student Handbook.
Some teaching fellows, including those who come from outside Harvard, have no guarantee of a teaching offer. Arkadiy L. Maksimovskiy, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School who occasionally teaches in the psychology department, said waiting for enrollment numbers to come in can be stressful, both financially and in terms of scheduling.
“If you ask a graduate student, I would imagine it would impact their schedule a lot more. They have more at stake in terms of schedule, but not as much in terms of income,” he said. “For me, I guess it’s sort of the other way around. Income is certainly a part of it—it’s not guaranteed for me—and I kind of have to wait,” he added.
Maksimovskiy, who is a currently a teaching fellow in Psychology 1355: “The Adolescent Brain,” said that his appointment was finalized on Monday afternoon.
“If it’s a good match, all the professor can say is that it depends on the final enrollment in the class. That can go on for a while, and no one knows until shopping week is over. This semester, it was like, high probability Friday afternoon and it was finalized [Monday],” he said. “In the course of a couple of hours, you can go from not knowing whether you have this commitment, or you will. Things start moving very quickly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a hundred astronomers and visiting scholars gathered in the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics’s Phillips Auditorium to hear about the latest advancements in astrophysics at a Thursday luncheon hosted by the Harvard-based Institute for Theory and Computation.
The institute's weekly luncheons attract attendees from around the world, who enjoy sandwiches and chips while listening to four 10-minute presentations on different topics within the field. Presenting at this week’s luncheon were Maciek Wielgus, a fellow at Harvard’s Black Hole Initiative; James J. Bock, a physics professor at Caltech; Saurabh Singh, a Ph.D. student at the Raman Research Institute in India; and Christopher F. McKee ’64, professor emeritus of astronomy and physics at UC Berkeley.
Harvard Astronomy Department Chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb said the weekly luncheons are an important way for astronomers and scientists to stay up-to-date with the latest results in the field.
“Astronomy is a very active frontier of research. We now know things we haven’t known a decade ago, which are very exciting,” said Loeb, who is also the director of the Institute and the Black Hole Initiative.
Loeb added that Harvard’s unique resources and academic environment are valuable for the future development of his field.
“Harvard is very special. A year and a half ago, we inaugurated the Black Hole Initiative, which is the only center in the world which focuses on black holes, all aspects of black holes,” Loeb said. “The special thing about this center is that it involves people from the astronomy department, the physics department, the math department, and philosophy and history of science departments.”
At Thursday’s luncheon, Wielgus described one Black Hole Initiative-related project, which uses the Event Horizon Telescope to image the silhouette of Sagittarius A*, a radio source believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. After explaining the premise of his research, Wielgus identified visibility errors as one of the main challenges for the project.
The colloquium then turned to focus on the BICEP-Keck experiments, which measure the cosmic microwave background radiation that pervades the universe. Data from the experiments are being used to find signals of gravitational waves from the beginning of the universe, according to Loeb.
Singh’s presentation discussed the first stars formed during the period when the universe became completely ionized, as well as an experiment measuring the effects of radiation from those stars on hydrogen gas in an earlier universe.
In his talk, McKee presented a model supporting the hypothesis that previously unaccounted-for subatomic particles called galactic baryons could be found in the galactic corona, described by Loeb as “the halo of hot gas that surrounds the Milky Way.”

The Harvard Varsity Club distributed copies of a book about mental health and Ivy League athletics to Harvard athletes and athletics administrators on Wednesday, drawing praise from current and former student-athletes.
“What Made Maddy Run: The Secret Struggles and Tragic Death of an All-American Teen” tells the story of Madison S. Holleran, a successful student-athlete at the University of Pennsylvania who took her own life in the spring of her first year at the university.
Author Kate Fagan’s ESPN feature, “Split Image,” was widely read and praised for its in-depth look at Holleran’s struggles with mental health despite outward appearances of happiness and success at an Ivy League university. In “What Made Maddy Run,” Fagan looks closer both at Holleran’s life and the role social media and social stigma play in students’ mental health.
The idea of distributing the book started early last fall when Jessica L. Perillo ’14, a special assistant for the Varsity Club, presented the work to administrators in Harvard’s Athletics Department. The Varsity Club and the Athletics Department gave copies of the book to athletic coaches and department administrators in December, and then to varsity captains on Wednesday.
Perillo, a former member of the women’s softball team, said that she wanted to share the book with current athletes after seeing parallels between her own experience as an Ivy League athlete and the struggles that Holleran faced. Perillo was a student at Harvard when Holleran took her life in Jan. 2014.
“I remember when the incident happened. Unfortunately, it was during my time at college and I remember hearing about it,” Perillo said.
“I thought, if I could relate to this story, then there must be so many others that can relate to it too,” Perillo added. “There was a little bit of comfort of knowing that I wasn’t kind of alone feeling that way as a student-athlete.”
Jay D. Hebert ’18, captain of the men’s track and field team, said that he thought the book would give Harvard athletes an opportunity to look at their own lives from a new perspective.
“As student-athletes, I think we get absorbed in that world sometimes,” Hebert said, referring to the competitive nature of Division I college athletics added to the rigor of Ivy League academics. “The book is a good opportunity to sort of step out and see it from a different perspective.”
Perillo said that the Varsity Club has no plans to host formal discussions on the book. Instead, she said she hopes the book sparks discussion within athletic teams without formal conversations guided by administrators.
Hebert said he hopes that after he and his co-captain read the book they will be able to discuss it with the team.
“Through my experience, putting faith in a college kid to read this and digest it and understand everything on their own, that’s asking a lot,” Hebert said. “The more you can talk about this, the better.”

UPDATED: February 4, 2018 at 7:01 p.m.
Students will have the opportunity to enter the Transcript Project, a creative competition for undergraduates to reflect on their course choices and academic trajectory, according to an announcement by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on Wednesday.
The project encourages students to view their transcript as representative of a series of memorable academic moments rather than of a list of grades. Students can participate in the competition by submitting a piece of work, such as a short essay, song, or photo, that encapsulates and analyzes their academic journey at Harvard.
Project creator Robin E. Kelsey, dean of arts and humanities, said undergraduates on the student advisory board for arts and humanities were enthusiastic about the idea and said that the college transcript is often equated with a sense of anxiety.
“I was hoping to turn the transcript into an occasion for students to think differently about the intellectual odyssey that being at Harvard can represent,” Kelsey said.
Kelsey said he saw many transcripts when he was president of the College’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, a prestigious national honor society. He said that a lot of transcripts he reads are “immaculate or close to immaculate,” but are “a little short on adventure.” The Transcript Project’s purpose is for students to reflect on their intellectual journey and set aside grades.
“The motivation was to offset the many accolades that we have at Harvard for people with immaculate transcripts and to recognize the spirit of adventure which the transcript represents,” Kelsey said.
Encouraging students to consider their academic choices, the Transcript Project’s website poses a series of prompts: “What was my best semester? What made it the ‘best’?”
To launch the new competition, Kelsey said he participated in the project himself by digging his undergraduate transcript from Yale out of a cardboard box in his basement. Kelsey also took over Khurana’s popular Instagram account on Thursday to promote the project, posting black and white photos with commentary on his years as a student.
He wrote an essay, “D is for Dean (A Dean’s Transcript Project),” in which he reflects on a D that he received in a course on philosophical logic. Kelsey wrote he was searching for answers to “life’s big questions” and became uninterested in learning “formal logic;” he flunked the final for his philosophical logic course by writing about his “disenchantment.”
Kelsey wrote that the courses on his transcript range from aerodynamics to the history of pastoral nomadism and art history. Now, as a dean overseeing many diverse fields, he said he appreciates the knowledge he gained from taking a wide array of classes.
“The mental restlessness that pervades my transcript turned out to be valuable,” Kelsey wrote in the essay. “From my office in University Hall, I look after departments and programs that span subjects from ancient Egyptian tombs to contemporary fan fiction. My roving neurons could hardly be happier.”
Kelsey said he recognizes, however, that the world has changed since he went to college. He said that vocation was “the last thing on my mind” in college, while today, it is unrealistic to expect college students not to consider future jobs and postgraduate opportunities when selecting courses and concentrations.
“I certainly wouldn’t want students to take my project as a suggestion that this is the approach that you should take,” Kelsey said. “And I fully recognize that the way I approached course selection may not even feel available to students now.”
Kelsey said he hopes students will have fun with the Transcript Project and that reflections on their intellectual journey will enable them to make “interesting and adventuresome choices” as they continue college.
Concluding his Transcript Project essay, Kelsey wrote: “Tucked in a musty box in the basement, my transcript holds a reminder that life defies logic, and deans may begin with a D.”
UPDATED: February 4, 2018
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Dean Robin E. Kelsey is the current president of the College's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. In fact, he stopped holding that position last summer.

The Harvard Business School announced a new fellowship Wednesday to support MBA graduates who work in Africa directly after graduation.
The Global Opportunity Fellowship (GO: Africa) will award graduates up to $50,000 towards the difference between their salaries and $100,000, with the goal of supporting MBA graduates who pursue career opportunities in Africa. The fellowship will provide financial support for one to five years and grant a maximum of $150,000 over that time span to graduates beginning with the Class of 2018.
The fellowship grew out of a review of the financial aid process at HBS, according to Chad Losee, managing director of admissions and financial aid at the school. His department consulted with alumni and students interested in Africa to develop a program that would encourage recent alumni to bring their job skills to a continent often overlooked by Business School graduates, Losee said.
“The reason we feel it’s going to make such a big impact is prevailing salaries are lower and there’s also a fair amount of exchange rate fluctuation in some of the currencies on the continent,” he said. “Being able to supplement that income from a U.S. dollar perspective, we think it will go a long way.”
GO: Africa grew out of the school’s mission statement to “educate leaders who make a difference in the world” and builds on its recent efforts to expand its impact in Africa, according to the fellowship’s website. The Business School opened a research office in Johannesburg last year, which will foster relationships with academic and business leaders throughout the continent.
The creation of the fellowship also coincides with the 20th anniversary of the Africa Business Conference, the largest student-run conference at HBS. The Business School’s Africa Business Club hosts the conference, which brings in 1000 attendees from close to 30 countries and features a variety of speakers and panels, as well as a competition for African startups with a reward of $10,000.
The new fellowship is funded entirely by alumni donations, according to Losee. Currently 1,700 HBS alumni work in Africa—a network that recent graduates are encouraged to use to find career opportunities, Losee said.
Students interested in both for-profit and nonprofit work are encouraged to apply, Losee added.
“Students have so many different ideas and so many different industries that they want to have an impact in from education to manufacturing to job creation,” Losee said. “We really want to keep this fairly open so that people can pursue what they’re uniquely good at and what they’re specifically passionate about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite Cambridge residents’ frustrations about construction plans to renovate Gore Street, Cambridge City Council announced Monday that construction would proceed as planned, though with a plan in place to mitigate its effects.
The construction, set to begin Feb. 2, includes a new gas pipeline developed by Eversource and a new sewer pipeline developed by DivcoWest, the developer of the neighborhood Cambridge Crossing. The city of Cambridge is also installing a new water pipeline, paved roads, and accessible sidewalks, among other improvements.
The project at Gore Street, which sits between Monsignor O’Brien Highway and Warren Street, was first proposed around 20 years ago. But, the project stood at a standstill for a 10-year period, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said at Monday’s City Council meeting.
When the city previously suggested moving the project to the another site, the Prison Point Facility, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority insisted that Gore Street was the only option.
Kathy Watkins, assistant commissioner of engineering for the Department of Public Works, said that the alternative route did not have the capacity in its system.
“The Prison Point Facility is designed to be a wet weather facility, so they do not encourage and they do not want additional dry weather typical sewer flow into that system,” Watkins said. “It has significant pumping constraints based on that.”
During public comment, some residents of Gore Street said they were concerned about potential damage to their properties, many of which are decades old and have been passed on for generations.
“There was folklore there, there was history, and many things I’ve appreciated about the neighborhood are now being threatened,” said Martha E. Kats, a longtime Gore Street resident.
Owen O’Riordan, commissioner of the Department of Public Works, said the city has experience working on “thousands upon thousands” of properties. He said that home inspections would help ensure damage would not happen.
Audrey A. Cunningham, another resident, read from a statement with more than 50 signatures from residents. The statement criticized the lack of transparency surrounding the decision to move forward with the project and argued that the construction put the “desires of a huge developer” over the “lives and and property of lifelong residents.”
“The residents of Gore Street are furious. There is a sense of outrage that we were never informed throughout the twenty plus years that this was under discussion,” added Lois E. Sullivan.
Despite concerns from residents, DePasquale said that the Gore Street construction project was not up for negotiation. The infrastructure improvements are necessary for the wellbeing of the city as a whole, he said.
“When I became City Manager, my biggest commitment was to work with neighborhoods, to try to make sure they were heard and listened to,” DePasquale said. “But this is a really tricky situation because when it comes to the sewer work and infrastructure work, it is the city’s responsibility to meet the needs of all our residents.”
Additionally, the City Council adopted policy orders to discuss the possibility of improvements to East Cambridge’s Gold Star Mothers Park and of using construction technology that could speed up the project. Councillor Alanna M. Mallon said she hopes the city can “give something back” in light of the challenges associated with the project.
“For me, at this point, it’s about mitigating the effects of what those neighbors are going to feel the next years while they are undergoing this large project,” Mallon said.
Mallon stressed the significance of more communication with residents not just for the Gore Street construction but for “all projects.” Mayor Marc C. McGovern agreed that an open discussion involving the public was important for future decisions. “One of the things we can push the City Manager on and continue to improve on is making sure that we are engaging in the process with the community where all points of views are respected and have the opportunity to be heard,” McGovern said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts say the effect of the unprecedented federal tax on Harvard’s endowment remains unclear as the federal government continues to work out how the new law will be implemented, though it could potentially change Harvard’s long-term investment strategy if tax rates increase.
In December, Republican lawmakers passed tax legislation—dubbed the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”— which requires private colleges with endowments greater than $500,000 per student to pay a 1.4 percent tax on annual endowment returns. Harvard is one of 35 institutions that could pay tens of millions in federal tax under this new provision. Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 criticized the bill in a November email to Harvard affiliates, estimating that the University would have paid $43 million if the tax had existed in fiscal year 2017.
New York University finance professor David L. Yermack ’85 said there were “big unknowns” surrounding the tax bill as the Internal Revenue Service has yet to define how the law will be regulated.
If, for instance, capital gains are only taxed upon sale, Yermack said he would expect Harvard to do “much less high frequency trading” in order to avoid taxation.
“Until the IRS weighs in on this, we would not have a lot to go on in terms of what fraction of the profits of the endowment of any university might be taxed, let alone what might be exempt,” Yermack said. “Until they write the regulations and explain how they will regulate this, it’s anybody’s guess.”
The process of executing the new tax law, which Yermack called the “broadest tax bill in 30 years,” could take months to resolve—potentially years if a university challenges the legislation in federal court.
Business School Professor Luis M. Viceira said the 1.4 percent tax rate could affect how Harvard spends its money, but it is not likely to “make a huge difference” for the University’s overall investment strategy. Viceira warned, however, that the precedent the endowment tax sets could lead to longer-term consequences.
“Going down into the future, once you have started taxing returns on the endowment, the tax rate could go up,” Viceira said. “And if it does, it can start having a meaningful impact on how Harvard will think about investing.”
Viceira said if the endowment tax rate increases—up to 10 percent, for instance— the University will have “preference for securities that are tax efficient.” Harvard Management Company, which manages Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment, would look for longer-term capital gains rather than short-term dividends.
“You will have a preference for not realizing short-term capital gains because they get taxed higher than long-term capital gains,” Viceira said. “You will have a preference for equities over fixed incomes because fixed incomes will be more heavily taxed.”
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Vanessa McMillan wrote that the University is keeping close tabs on the situation.
“At this time, the University is evaluating the details of the tax law’s provisions, assessing the impacts of the new investment income tax, and developing an appropriate approach to implementation,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Nine students were elected to the Undergraduate Council after this week’s midterm election, according to UC Election Commission Chair Jubin Gorji ’21. The Election Commission also called for a re-vote in Leverett House after no candidate there reached the vote threshold necessary to be elected.
A total of 371 undergraduates cast ballots this year, according to data provided by the Election Commission, representing a slight decrease from the 402 who voted in last year's midterm election.
UC elections use the Hare-Clark voting method, a type of ranked voting system in which each candidate must reach a certain vote quota to be elected. In Leverett this week, a write-in candidacy by former UC representative Benjamin Sorkin ’20 prevented incumbent Ruiqi He ’19 from reaching the required threshold.
Sorkin, who lost his seat on the Council in last fall’s UC election, received more first, second, and third-place votes than He. Sorkin said he was “peeved” that he was not declared the outright winner.
Sorkin said he ran as a write-in candidate because he was not properly informed of the open seat, only finding out when candidates officially filed declarations Monday.
“I ran because the open seat wasn’t advertised and so we tried to stick it to the fact that the seat wasn’t advertised as being open, even though I knew well in advance that it should’ve been open,” Sorkin said.
UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said that communication with prospective candidates could have been better, but that she promises to improve communication in the future.
“There should have been an email to Leverett and I’m glad that we had the write-in system so that [Sorkin] was able to run as a write-in candidate,” Zhang said. “We’ll make sure in the future that all publicity is going to be streamlined, especially since our secretary is getting an email that will be able to be sent out to all students.”
Leverett’s re-vote began Thursday night with an email from the Election Commission to Leverett students, and will end Friday at 5 p.m.
Newly elected Adams House Representative K. Yu-Mi Kim ’20 said she is excited to start her term on the Council, and will draw on her experience in student government from high school to help her on the UC.
“I feel really privileged to get to represent so many truly exceptional people who have such different interests,” Kim said. “I felt like I had leadership skills that I could use to both improve Harvard community as it is today and also for future Harvard students.”
Kim said her ability to bring students from different viewpoints together would be a useful asset on the Council.
“I’m definitely both a generalist and a specialist in that I study History of Science and English and I think that I understand the experience of both science students as well as students in the humanities,” Kim said.
Newly elected Dudley House Representative Sophia M.F. Higgins ’20 also said she was eager to get to work, hoping to focus her efforts on the Council on issues facing minority students and those with mental illnesses. Specifically, Higgins said she hopes to be involved in the efforts to establish a multicultural center on campus, which have gained momentum in the past few months.
Higgins, an active Crimson magazine editor, said a priority of the Council should be to improve its communication with the student body.
“The UC should probably hold more town halls just to keep the student body up to speed on where they’re at in proposing certain policies,” Higgins said. “I think getting more student opinions in the mix will probably help the UC accurately represent what the student body wants.”
The full list of newly elected Council members are as follows:
Adams House
K. Yu-Mi Kim ’20
Cabot House
Ashish Dahal ’20
Currier House
Anne M. Raheem ’19
Dudley House
Sophia M. F. Higgins ’20
Dunster House

Around 100 students from across the University spent Thursday evening marching up and down in front of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum to protest Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin while he spoke on immigration to a select handful of Harvard affiliates inside.
Some demonstrators said they turned out to rally against what they called Senate Democrats’ too-eager willingness to reopen the government after a three-day shutdown last month. The shutdown began when Republicans refused to pass a bill protecting recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era initiative that gives legal protections to undocumented young people. Durbin was one of 33 Democrats who voted to end the government shutdown instead of negotiating a new DACA bill.
Durbin, one of the original co-sponsors of the Dream Act, recently proposed an immigration reform bill—co-sponsored by Senator Lindsey O. Graham—that would make the DACA program permanent. But the bill would also cancel the visa lottery and limit family-based migration; many protesters said they find both eliminations unacceptable.
Bearing signs reading “We Are Not Your Bargaining Chip” and “The U.S. Government Has Never Protected Us,” demonstrators stationed themselves as close to the Kennedy School as possible and chanted slogans like, “Say it loud, say it clear—immigrants are welcome here!” The protesters—accompanied by a live band including at least one tuba-player—began shouting before Durbin took the stage around 6 p.m. and continued until after his speech ended.
A small number of demonstrators infiltrated the building, silently raising signs and keeping them aloft for part of Durbin’s speech.
Hyo-won “Esther” Jeon ’18, who spoke at the protest and said she helped organize the effort, said she thinks Democrats have disregarded several key opportunities to stand by the Dream Act. She said she wishes Democrats would use must-pass legislation—like the spending bill that caused last month’s shutdown—for leverage.
“When we needed them to hold the line down for us, they weren’t doing that,” Jeon said. “Every time they kick the can down the road, all they’re doing is making people more vulnerable to deportation.”
“When you hurt one of us, you hurt all of us,” Jeon, a DACA recipient, added.
The demonstration was co-sponsored by nearly 20 student organizations including Act on a Dream, the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Women’s Association, and the Harvard College Democrats.
During his speech and in an interview after the event, Durbin said he supported the protesters inside and outside the Kennedy School. He thanked them for their efforts and encouraged them to become “the driving force” for immigration reform in the U.S.
“I don’t want them to give up on this country. I’m not giving up on them, and I thank them for being out there in the cold tonight, marching with their signs,” Durbin said.
Inside the Kennedy School, Durbin spoke for roughly an hour about his personal experiences with DACA recipients and his efforts to pass a bipartisan immigration deal with the White House. University President Drew G. Faust introduced Durbin, calling him an advocate for Dreamers.
Durbin said Thursday he thinks immigration is “the civil rights issue of our time.”
A smaller group of about 14 students—a mix of undergraduates and graduate students from some of Harvard’s 12 schools—met with Durbin privately before his address.
Maribel Nava ’20, one of the attendees, declined to reveal exactly what Durbin discussed with the group, noting the meeting was supposed to be off-the-record. Nonetheless, she said she thought the conversation was at least somewhat productive.
“We got across a couple of things that we wanted to share, which are the things that matter to us so much—that it’s more than just the dreamers, that it’s about parents, it’s about the 11 million,” she said.
Still, though, Nava said she felt overall “a little disappointed” with the meeting, noting that the Illinois senator arrived late.
“Our conversation was definitely shortened a little bit,” Nava said.
Durbin devoted much of his speech Thursday evening to addressing concerns raised by Jeon and other protesters that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will not fulfill his promise to work on a bipartisan immigration agreement. McConnell publicly pledged during the shutdown that he would allow a vote on a measure to protect Dreamers from deportation.
Durbin said he trusts McConnell to work with him on a deal as promised.
“I’m going to hold him to that promise and I believe he’ll keep that promise,” Durbin said. “I hope he doesn’t break my heart.”

Protesters criticized this strategy and said they think Democrats should fight for a “clean Dream Act” without concessions to Republicans.
“I know that if the Dream Act passes and it’s not a clean Dream Act, I would feel nothing but guilt that this is what it took for me to become a U.S. citizen,” Laura S. Veira ’20 said during the question-and-answer portion of the event.
Durbin said a clean Dream Act is impossible at the moment because he still needs five or six more Republican senators to agree to support the bill.
As negotiations stretch on in Washington, DACA recipients and advocates at Harvard say they feel uncertainty has become the only certainty.
“I don’t remember a time where I constantly didn’t wish for papers,” Veira said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not much is certain about February in Boston: the weather, the Super Bowl matchup, and whether the Charles will be frozen or flowing are all toss-ups. One thing Bostonians can count on, however, is the annual faceoff between the city’s four most storied hockey programs in the Beanpot.
A tradition that began back in 1952, the tournament features Boston College, Boston University, Harvard, and Northeastern, who battle under the bright lights of TD Garden, normally the home territory of the Celtics and the Bruins.
Kicking off every year on the first Monday of the month, the ’Pot pits pairs of teams in a semifinal matchup and then wraps up with a consolation game and a championship game the following Monday. But this isn’t just any college hockey tournament.
“The coaches all take the high road going into the Beanpot,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “But there’s no question that when you win it, it’s a nice feather in your cap all summer long…. Hopefully we’ll have a chance to keep that crown on as long as we can.”
For Harvard, last year’s Beanpot culminated in historic fashion, as the Crimson ended a 24-year title drought by beating BU, 6-3—the feather in coach Donato’s cap. The team will look to go the distance again, but, as in most years, nationally ranked teams and NHL-bound starpower stand in the way.
“The Beanpot is a whole different animal,” said tri-captain goalie Merrick Madsen, who backstopped Harvard to the championship win last year. “No matter what season anyone is having [in] any given year, the Beanpot brings out the best in everybody.”
Harvard will begin the road back to the Beanpot title by once again squaring off against the Terriers on Monday. Before the tournament gets underway, here is a look at the other three contenders heading into the first week of games:
BOSTON COLLEGE
The 2016 Beanpot winner has recent history on its side—the team has won six of the last eight tournaments and now sits atop Hockey East. The 20-time victors emerged triumphant in their last championship appearance, taking the pot home in a 1-0 overtime win over BU.
Last year, thought, the Eagles bowed out of the tournament with no wins at all, after losing to the Terriers in the semifinal and then to Northeastern in the consolation game.
“For the longest time, it was just BU and BC that won it,” said Madsen, referring to the fact that the two schools shared all the Beanpot crowns between the Crimson’s 1993 and 2017 titles. “They know how to win the Beanpot, and we’re going to have to be ready to perform.”
This season, BC is 2-2-1 against Beanpot competitors, having tied Harvard, 4-4, back in November and split its series against the other Comm. Ave teams. Coming into Monday’s tilt ranked No. 16/15 in the nation, the Eagles (13-10-3, 13-5-0 Hockey East) rode an eight-game unbeaten streak this fall into the top-20.
At the time, the stretch was the second-longest streak in the country, before BC ultimately fell to crosstown rival BU on Dec. 1. The Eagles have cooled down in recent weeks, however, skating to a record of 3-3-1 in January.
Whereas the other Beanpot competitors have star scorers, BC puts up numbers by committee. Thus far, the team’s points leader is sophomore David Cotton, with 19 on the season. The Carolina Hurricanes prospect enjoyed a seven-game point streak through December and into late January—a stretch that started shortly after Cotton nabbed four points (1–3—4) against the Crimson the day after Thanksgiving.
Right behind him is the squad’s highest goal-scorer, freshman Graham McPhee (11–7—18), while three other players have 15 or more points. Incidentally, the Eagles also have the second-youngest roster in the NCAA, and its underclassmen account for a whopping 53 of its 72 goals thus far.
Clearly, BC’s youth should not be mistaken for inexperience. Two members of the team, junior defenseman Casey Fitzgerald and sophomore netminder Joe Woll, were part of last year’s gold-medal American team at the IIHF World Junior Championships. Both are 2018 Hobey Baker nominees.
Woll returned to the World Juniors this year and fielded pucks for Team USA en route to a bronze medal. Since his rookie campaign Woll has regressed somewhat. His .921 save percentage entering the 2017 Beanpot trumps this season’s .903 mark. Nevertheless, Woll was also named to the watchlist for the 2018 Mike Richter Award, given to the top D1 goalie.
BC faces off against Northeastern on Monday in a showdown of the top two Hockey East teams. The Eagles are 34-11 against the Huskies all-time during the Beanpot, but when the teams met last year, Northeastern triumphed, 4-2, on the back of a high-flying offense. That Huskies offense, despite having graduated a few key pieces, is still as potent as ever, so Woll and BC will have to earn a win on Monday.
BOSTON UNIVERSITY
As usual, the icemen of Agganis come into the tournament this year with a stacked roster, including three of the ten first-round NHL draft picks currently playing college hockey. These blue-chips slot in alongside nine more professional draftees, giving the Terriers the second-most NHL prospects in the NCAA behind Minnesota.
This is hardly news for BU. Somewhat less common for the program, however, is its pedestrian record (13-11-2, 9-7-2) and its unranked status.
The last time the Terriers entered the Beanpot out of the USCHO rankings was in the 2013-2014 season, when the team finished with a record of 11-21-4 overall—its worst performance by win percentage since 1963. Losing ways are out of the ordinary for BU, and the team that lost the 2017 Beanpot title to Harvard will certainly be looking to change that track.
Despite the up-and-down season to this point, there is no dearth of scoring to be found on this Terriers team. While junior alternate captain Bobo Carpenter leads scoring with 26 points (16–10—26), the roster boasts five other players who’ve notched 20 or more points so far this season.
Among them are junior alternate captain Jordan Greenway, who will shortly join the Crimson’s Ryan Donato on USA’s Olympic team, sophomore Dante Fabbro, gold medallist at the 2018 World Juniors with Team Canada, and rookie Brady Tkachuk, projected to be a top-ten pick in this year’s NHL draft.
“Right now, it’s a little far away, but I think we all know what they have, talent-wise, on that team,” said Harvard forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage earlier this week. “It doesn’t really change from year to year… everybody knows what team has talent and who you have to look out for.”
BU’s fresh talent makes it the youngest team in all of NCAA hockey, but the group has had exposure to high-stakes hockey this season, such as a matchup with then-No. 7 Cornell at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 26. The Terriers’ most important position of all—the one between the pipes—will be filled by two-time World Junior medallist, sophomore Jake Oettinger, who faced Harvard in last year’s Beanpot final.
Conceding five, as he did last season to the Crimson, was rare for Oettinger. The Dallas Stars prospect finished the 2016-2017 season with a .927 save percentage that put him at ninth in the country. Like BC’s Woll, Oettinger’s save percentage has regressed this season to a modest .908, but he’s riding a four-game win streak that includes a shutout and has the potential to be the gamechanger for the Terriers come Monday.
“We’ve learned that it’s not all about talent,” Ryan Donato said. “We have talented guys on our side as well. At the end of the day, what’s going to decide the game is hard work and determination to get a win.”
The Boston hockey classic’s winningest team is just 1-3-0 against Beanpot competition this season, having already been swept by Northeastern. On Monday, the Terriers will face off against the Crimson for the first time since last year’s tournament final ended in celebration for the Cantabrigians.
NORTHEASTERN
By all indications, the Huskies are the team to beat in this year’s Beanpot. No. 11/9 Northeastern (15-7-4, 11-5-2) comes into the tournament this year as the highest-ranked competitor.
Interestingly, though, the team is as historically unsuccessful in the Beanpot as it is apparently poised for success this time around—its last title came in 1988, and the program owns the fewest titles (4) of all four participants.
This year, though, the Huskies’ offense is producing at 3.50 goals per game, good for sixth nationally and only bolstered by the team’s third-ranked power play (26.9%). Leading the charge is Hobey Baker favorite, junior forward Adam Gaudette, who is tied for most points in the NCAA (19–20—39) and trails college hockey’s goal leader, Donato, by just one tally. Gaudette has five goals in four career Beanpot games, including two against Harvard in last year’s 4-3 semifinal loss.
Also in the 30-point club for the Huskies is senior alternate captain Dylan Sikura (13–22—35), who has amassed these numbers despite missing parts of the season to play for Canada. Sikura won the Spengler Cup, an invitational tournament, with the Canadian squad in late December. Also shouldering the scoring burden for the team, captain Nolan Stevens and sophomore Jeremy Davies have reached the 20-point plateau already.
While Gaudette and company are familiar faces to the Crimson, netminder Cayden Primeau (11-5-4, 2.06 GAA, .920 SV%) is not. Should Harvard meet Northeastern in the finals, Primeau, a rookie, will face the Crimson for the first time, as the two teams have not played yet this season. The Montreal Canadiens prospect had a shutout in his debut game, as well as in the Huskies’ last win on Jan. 20. But the Beanpot can do a number on highly-touted freshman goalies, if Woll’s and Oettinger’s performances last year are any indication.
Perhaps Northeastern’s only glaring weakness is its penalty kill, the worst of all Beanpot schools at 79.3 percent effective. Thus far, the team’s attacking skills have made up for that flaw. But if that shorthanded squad were to meet a determined BC team in the semifinals, a stellar offense might not be enough. In two games versus the Huskies this season, the Eagles scored on three of their seven power play opportunities.
Last year, too, Northeastern brought a Hobey Baker candidate—and eventual finalist—in Zach Aston-Reese to the Beanpot, only to head to the consolation game. But if their record and their ranking are any indication, the Huskies could prove a very different team when they face off against BC again in a few short days.
“I’m less worried about which group shows up from Comm. Ave,” coach Donato said. “I’m more worried about how we play, and...if we play our game, and are committed to the kind of game we know has success, then we’ll give ourselves a great chance to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Coming off the heels of a last-minute loss to Penn in the final game of the conference season last spring, Harvard had the chance to dance despite an undefeated conference season from Ancient Eight heavyweight Princeton.
It was uncharted territory for the Ivy League to say the least.
After falling to the Tigers twice on buzzer-beaters in the regular season, Tommy Amaker’s squad would have a chance to duke it out a third time with Princeton if the Crimson could take down Yale once more, making three total wins over the Bulldogs.
That game, however, would never materialize as Harvard lost in its tournament opener to Yale and, just as it deserved to, Princeton headed to the NCAA tournament.
The inaugural tournament didn’t all go as expected, though. In the other opener a Penn squad with a losing record took the Tigers into overtime in front of a crowd of Quaker faithful. Had Penn won, the No. 3 and 4 seeds of the conference would’ve been competing on Sunday for the opportunity to represent the Ancient Eight in March.
I think the biggest takeaway from this is that it must’ve just really sucked to be Princeton in that first game of the conference tournament.
No team had gone undefeated in conference play since Steve Donahue’s Cornell squad finished perfect in 2008. Now the Tigers were playing overtime basketball with a team that not only had a losing record, but on their home court as well. This isn’t to say, though, that the conference tournament is flawed by any means—had Penn gone dancing it probably would’ve raised flags about the location of the tournament, but all in all it was an overdue addition to the conference.
What last season exemplifies the best, though, is the degree to which every team loves the conference tournament when they wouldn’t otherwise win the conference outright.
If I were a betting man, I’d say Tommy Amaker is starting to feel a bit like Princeton probably did at the end of last season. This isn’t to say the Crimson is on the verge of an undefeated season, but coming off a weekend sweep on the road and given Yale’s loss to Brown and Princeton’s loss to Penn, it would appear Harvard is becoming the team to beat.
To be clear, the season is still young and we’re only through the first back-to-back weekend of basketball.
With that said, Coach Amaker’s squad has a lot going its way—a Yale team that was expected to be neck-and-neck with the Crimson is still without standout guard Makai Mason, and the Bulldogs also lost forward Jordan Bruner for the year with a torn meniscus. The Crimson also already played and beat Yale on the road, so what would have likely been Harvard’s toughest matchup is over. The Crimson escaped with a 54-52 win.
Princeton, predicted to be Harvard’s next toughest matchup, lost its conference opener to an up-and-coming Penn squad which is also somehow the only other team still undefeated in Ivy League play. If anything, the Quakers might turn out to be the Crimson’s toughest matchup in the conference season. Headlined by sophomores AJ Brodeur and Ryan Betley, Penn will probably be Harvard’s biggest contenders for the next two years. While talented, the Quakers also arguably more inexperienced that Amaker’s squad—nearly all of the Crimson’s current sophomores saw significant playing time while two of Penn’s starters hardly saw the floor last season.
It would be tough to really put any other team in contention here. Brown has a seriously talented freshman in Desmond Cambridge and Brandon Anderson is arguably one of the best guards in the conference, but the Brown Bears are still probably a year or two from contention. Columbia won a grand total of three games in their non-conference slate and lost nine in a row at one point. They also lost to Princeton by nearly 40. For its part, Cornell dropped one to the Lions.
What this adds up to is Harvard’s best shot at a conference title in the past two years—Princeton graduated an immensely talented senior class and Yale is without what could very well be its best two players.
The road is as open as it could be for the Crimson.
It hasn’t all been perfect for Harvard, however. In its non-conference schedule the Crimson struggled against plenty of teams it should have absolutely been able to beat; these included losses at Holy Cross, Manhattan, CSU Fullerton, and Northeastern. Perhaps most importantly, Harvard has been without former Ivy League Rookie of the Year Bryce Aiken. The sophomore guard went nearly a month off the court and then played sparingly on the road at Dartmouth and Yale before scoring 18 points in 20 minutes at Brown.
All told, the Crimson has what might be its best chance in the next few years. Once again, if I was a betting man I’d take Harvard to finish with the best record in conference.
Unfortunately for this team, that doesn’t mean much anymore. With the tournament at the Palestra once again, Crimson faithful should just hope for a first round matchup against not-Penn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s take a trip down memory lane to Feb. 20, 2016 in Ithaca, N.Y., a place to which few people dream of returning. We could pick lines from several Bruce Springsteen songs to describe a place that brags about its gorges (“My City of Ruins”, “Waitin’ on a Sunny Day”, and “Better Days” all come to mind), but I think a line from “Working on a Dream” says it best about the city of 30,000—“out here the nights are long, the days are lonely.” It was an uncharacteristically warm day in a place where the sun rarely shines, literally or figuratively.
Ithaca is 52 miles from the state’s best basketball school (Syracuse), 100 more than that to its nearest NFL team (Nate Peterman’s Buffalo Bills), and 227 away from its travel partner and the other half of the Gentleman’s C’s, Columbia. With that said, it’s understandable why almost 2,000 people were in the stands on that February Saturday night two years ago when two Ivy League teams that had a combined league record of 4-14 squared off at Newman Arena.
Harvard fans may remember the team’s matchup at Cornell from two seasons ago, a game that saw the Crimson claw back from a 21-point deficit and shock Cornell on a buzzer-beater by then-freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy. It was the most exciting game of the season for a team that was essentially eliminated from Ivy League contention before the calendar even turned to February.
What is easily overlooked from that game is the performance, particularly in the first half, from Big Red guard Matt Morgan, who, like McCarthy, was playing in just his 10th Ivy League contest. Fast-forward two years and Morgan is arguably the top offensive player in the Ancient Eight and the best pure scorer that Harvard will face this season. The spindly shooting guard with an unorthodox jumpshot is averaging 23.6 points per game—good for sixth nationally—while playing for a team that enters the weekend with a 7-10 record on the season highlighted by a 37-point shellacking at the hands of Princeton.
The Crimson’s matchup at Cornell two seasons ago was a historic one for Morgan. The Concord, N.C., native came out firing, scoring 19 points in the game’s first 11:44 (the same number as the entire Harvard team) in a half when it felt like the Big Red could not miss. Cornell made its first six 3-point attempts and shot 62.5 percent from the field before intermission. For a Crimson team that prided itself on defense, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker had no answer for the 6’2” freshman, who was nailing threes just inside midcourt, weaving through the Harvard defense, and throwing down monster dunks. Morgan entered the locker room with 22 points on six-of-nine shooting, including a four-of-seven line from three-point range. He finished the game with 27 points, becoming the Big Red’s all-time freshman scoring leader (through just 24 games) in the process.
A lot has changed since that meeting two years ago in Ithaca, but the high level of play from Morgan has been a constant. The junior has been a second team All-Ivy pick in each of his first two college seasons, averaging over 18 points per game both years. He dropped 34 points in a game against Delaware earlier this season and has gone for 20 or more points in 14 of his team’s 17 contests. Unlike many high volume shooters, Morgan has scored the basketball efficiently, shooting 50.2 percent from the field and 40.3 from three-point range. Of the nation’s top ten leading scorers, the Cornell junior leads all of them in field goal percentage and is third in three-point percentage.
We’re not sure if there’s a difference between Ivy League Player of the Year (which over the past five years has been awarded to the best player on one of the conference’s two best teams) and Ivy League Most Valuable Player (an award that we made up but would be given to the player whose team would be the worst without him), but Morgan would definitely be the frontrunner for the second honor. In addition to leading his team in scoring by a large margin, Morgan is also the Big Red’s leader in assists and ranks third in rebounds. If college basketball had a wins above replacement stat, Morgan’s would be very high and a Cornell team without him would have a win total that would be very low.
Just for entertainment’s sake, let’s look at some of the non-Morgan related tidbits from that game two seasons ago. Cornell has a new coach in Brian Earl, who took over Cornell after nine seasons as an assistant at Princeton, after it did not renew the contract of Bill Courtney following the 2015-2016 season. While Courtney set a low bar with his .347 winning percentage over six seasons (highlighted by a 2-26 campaign in 2013-2014), Earl is doing his best to one-up his predecessor, leading his team to wins in just 32.6 percent of the games that he has coached while at the helm of the Big Red.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker used ten players in the contest two seasons ago. Five are still on the team, but junior guard Corey Johnson is the only one who consistently finds himself in the Crimson’s rotation. Harvard still prides itself on its defense but was a much more efficient three-point shooting team two years ago (38.7 percent) than it is this season (30.7). However, the Crimson enters its meeting with Cornell in a much different spot than it did two years ago. Harvard sits in first place in the Ivy League and has won its last four conference contests, a far cry from its 1-5 mark to begin Ancient Eight play in 2015-2016. Morgan may be the best pure scorer that Harvard will face this season, but it’s going to be a long walk home to Cambridge if the Crimson cannot find a way to top a Cornell team that largely revolves around its star guard.
Now to the picks:
DARTMOUTH AT CORNELL
A co-writer of ours at The Crimson said something ridiculous the other day. He said, “I think we’ve exhausted all Ithaca commentary.”
False.
There is no such thing. This matchup in particular presents an interesting case. Both of these institutions have something no other school in the Ivy League has. That’s right, both have acceptance rates above 10 percent.
Incredible.
Cornell was founded by Andrew Dickinson and Ezra Cornell with the purpose of creating, “an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.” They really followed through—Cornell has both the highest acceptance rate in the Ivy League and you can study hotel management whilst in Ithaca.
For its part Dartmouth just changed its logo to a really ugly and fake looking pine inside of a letter D. It’s no wonder former Ivy League Rookie of the Year Evan Boudreaux left.
With no Boudreaux, and without a win in conference so far, things are looking sad in Hanover.
Pick: Cornell
HARVARD AT COLUMBIA
This game might have been the Crimson’s low point of last year’s conference season. Coming off a last-minute win at Cornell the night before, Harvard shot a ridiculous 39 three-pointers, connecting on a grand total of 25 percent.
Needless to say, the Crimson lost despite an off night from touted freshman guard Mike Smith for Columbia. The real takeaway from that game, though, was that a supposedly esteemed institution in the middle of New York can’t provide internet for visiting journalists. If the Lions can clean up their act in this department then perhaps we’d be more friendly when it came to the pick.
It would also help to win more than three games in non-conference play.
Pick: Harvard
BROWN AT PENN
This might be the closest matchup of the weekend. The Brown Bears come in with the highest scoring offense in the conference while the Quakers have what might be the most talented frontcourt in the league. Penn stunned Princeton and for its part Brown upset Yale. This one should be interesting to watch.
No sarcasm here. This should actually be a good game.
Pick: Penn
YALE AT PRINCETON
A couple weeks back we called Harvard’s game at Wofford a true bowtie and button-down affair, but I think this matchup would definitely take that crown if there was one. I feel like this is the kind of game where the players get served hors d’oeuvres at the half and there’s a joint celebratory tea afterwards where the players toast to good fortune and exclaim, “Pip pip cheerio!”
Anyway, these two have really fallen from grace the past two weeks. We said it once, but we’ll say it again: Yale lost to Brown and Princeton lost to Penn. With that said, Yale comes in injured and Penn is no doubt a better team than Brown.
Pick: Princeton
HARVARD AT CORNELL
In breaking Ithaca news apparently the dean of Cornell’s business college abruptly resigned and people are looking for answers.
What we would like to know is why no one was this concerned when Cornell’s basketball team went missing a couple years ago.
Pick: Harvard
DARTMOUTH AT COLUMBIA
We’d like to paint a picture for this one—a lone and starving lion scavenges in the expanse of a big green forest that’s slowly wilting away. The starving lion comes to base of a pine tree to rest and as it slowly reclines the wilting pine falls. Both die in the incident.
We’re not sure that was completely clear, but both of these teams have overall 4-13 records and will no doubt be fighting along with Cornell to not finish last in conference. Dartmouth took the biggest L of the season when Brown ran the length of the floor and won on a buzzer-beater while Columbia played a month and a half of basketball without a win.
This one will be close, but for all of the wrong reasons.
Pick: Columbia
BROWN AT PRINCETON
Princeton is objectively the most dislikable program in the Ivy League.
Their marching band wears these ridiculous orange coats and they crowd out the urinals at half time. They also parade their other athletes across the middle of the court at halftime and make them wave at the crowd which is frankly just a little bit strange for our taste.
Brown, on the other hand, has really good pizza and cookies for its esteemed journalists and gives you seats right near the action.
This would tend to influence our decision one way, but we calls it like we sees it.
Pick: Princeton
YALE AT PENN
Notably absent from our writing this year has been our mascot analysis’.
This one would be tough to call just as the matchup would in real life. Really, bulldogs are really just cute little dogs that exist because of a lot inbreeding and Quakers are sworn to peace and friendliness. These two shouldn’t fight.
Come Saturday, though, we think the pup will step up to the plate.
Pick: Yale

February has rolled around once again, and hockey has filled the air. Come Monday, fans will fill the seats of TD Garden for the yearly spectacle that awaits: Boston’s four most historic hockey programs are set to clash in the 66th annual Beanpot Tournament.
The event is known most notably for its tradition. Yet, last season, one of the Beanpot’s more steadfast traditions in recent decades wavered: for the first time since 1993, a team without “Boston” in its name took home the trophy.
Harvard overpowered Northeastern in the semifinals before torching Boston University in the championship game to secure its 11th Beanpot in school history, ending a 24-year drought. During this dry spell for the Crimson, the Comm. Ave. schools divvied up the titles amongst themselves, also excluding the Huskies from the fun.
This year, with the triumphant taste of last season still fresh in players’ mouths, the Crimson (9-8-4, 8-5-3 ECAC) faces off against the Terriers (13-11-2, 9-7-2 Hockey East) in a rematch of the 2017 finale, hoping to expunge one of the tournament’s old nicknames once and for all.
“The tournament has been referred to as the BU invitational in the past,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They’ve had a lot of success…. You hear it said almost every year, but I don’t think there’s any question that you wouldn’t be surprised if any one of the four teams won it this year.”
Through two periods, last season’s showdown between these teams remained close—at least on the scoreboard. In reality, though, Harvard put forth a statement performance, limiting BU to 17 shots overall and just two in the opening frame. On top of the rigid defensive effort, the Crimson skaters netted six goals on 46 shots en route to the 6-3 rout.
“What that did for us is it really kind of revived a lot of the excitement about Harvard hockey on campus, trying to get more students to come to games and stuff like that,” Harvard tri-captain Jake Horton said.
That decisive victory propelled Harvard to new heights in the Ted Donato era. The team carried its momentum from the Boston hockey classic to the Ivy League crown, the ECAC regular season and playoff championships, the East Regional title, and all the way to its first Frozen Four berth since 1994.
While last season’s matchup involved two top-five teams, both squads enter Monday’s bout on rockier terms than they did a year ago. So, the Beanpot marks a potential turning point in the teams’ seasons. Whatever the records to this point, the tournament has a special meaning about it that can rejuvenate a season in a single night.
“It’s great to see our older guys…grabbing our freshmen and sophomores, talking about what an experience it was to win the Beanpot, how much fun it was and how much it meant to the campus and how much it meant to the program,” coach Donato reflected. “It’s revitalized our thoughts about what the Beanpot can mean to our season.”
Alas, just one of the teams will leave TD Garden satisfied in a few nights. Either the Crimson double down on BU, or the Terriers get revenge—not both. And last season’s tilt only adds to the drama.
“We got to know that it’s not going to be like that again,” said junior forward Ryan Donato, referring to the 2017 title game. “We did play well, but we were a different team last year…. This year, we play more sound and stick to our systems, and things will come our way, but we just got to worry about our game.”
Despite starting the campaign as the preseason No. 2 seed, BU has been on the wrong end of its difficult schedule, containing such competition as No. 1 Cornell, No. 4/5 Denver, No. 7 Minnesota State, and No. 8 Providence (current rankings). The Terriers have also gone a lackluster 1-2-1 against Beanpot competition this year, splitting with BC and getting swept by Northeastern.
The Crimson’s story this year hardly strays from BU’s. Unranked status soon replaced Harvard’s optimistic top-five preseason projection, as a record nine-game road stretch featuring some of the country’s fiercest teams derailed the Crimson’s season early on. Since then, it has been an uphill climb for coach Donato’s group, who had been cruising unbeaten through the 2018 portion of its schedule (4-0-3) until hitting a roadblock last weekend versus Cornell and Colgate.
“BU is in a similar situation to us,” coach Donato noted. “It thinks that, ‘hey, we got a better team inside this shell, and let’s keep working at it to see if we can get it there as quick as possible.’”
Before its current six-game unbeaten streak (5-0-1), BU sat below the .500 mark at 8-11-1. Even now, at 13-11-2, the Terriers have underwhelmed this season, especially considering the talent that—like always, it seems—they bring out onto the ice.
Some of this talent turns over from year to year, as high-end NHL prospects have a history of leaving BU early to pursue professional careers—think Jack Eichel, Charlie McAvoy, and Clayton Keller more recently.
“Last year, they had guys like Keller and McAvoy, just the big names, and they have a lot of good guys that are still there, and they have a lot of good young guys,” Ryan Donato said. “I think we’ve learned that it’s not all about talent at the end of the day. We have talented guys on our side as well, so I think…what’s going to decide the game is hard work and determination to get a win.”
Donato’s dad, who doubles as his bench boss, likewise acknowledges the pure talent on the Terriers’ roster.
“They’re one of the most talented teams in the country, quite frankly,” coach Donato said. “They’re also young, so some of that talent hasn’t matured to where it’s going to be. [But] they certainly have some game-breakers.”
Even with this yearly turnover, the Terriers program is far from the Kentucky basketball-esque revolving door of freshman talent. The squad returns key pieces such as junior forwards Jordan Greenway and Bobo Carpenter, not to mention captain defenseman Brandon Hickey.
Greenway, a 6’5” freight train with 5’11” hands, will join Harvard’s Donato in representing team USA in the 2018 Winter Olympics later in February. The Minnesota Wild prospect will break a 98-year color barrier in US Olympic hockey when he dons the red, white, and blue. Carpenter, son of ex-NHLer Bobby, paces his team in scoring this season with 26 points (16–10—26) and can play on the wing or down the middle.
Adding freshmen Brady Tkachuk, Shane Bowers, and Logan Cockerill to the mix up front only bolsters an already-dynamic group. This forward corps averages 3.23 goals per game, good for 12th best in Division I and well ahead of Harvard’s 30th-best 2.90 clip.
On the back end, BU is just as dynamic. Even with the loss of McAvoy last season to the Boston Bruins, the program returns four top-six regulars. What’s more: the Terriers’ blue line is so deep that the seventh defenseman on any given night—who watches the game from the press box—is an NHL draft pick thanks to the offseason additions of rookie Kasper Kotkansalo, Cam Crotty, and David Farrance, all of whom are NHL draftees.
“Their defense corps, top to bottom, is—I think they have seven NHL draft picks,” marveled coach Donato, almost hung up on the notion of that fact. “They’re not that young on the blue line. They have Hickey. They have MacLeod.”
The keystone of this BU defense, sophomore net-minder Jake Oettinger manned the pipes in last season’s Beanpot final and will predictably do so again this year. The Dallas Stars prospect put forth a rock-solid campaign in 2016-2017 (21-11-3, 2.11 GAA, .927 SV%) but has regressed this season (9-10-2, 2.82 GAA, .904 SV%), mimicking the Terriers overall.
Somewhat confusingly, this star-studded defense has struggled to keep pucks out of the net this year, allowing a middling 2.73 goals per game. The Crimson bests BU in this regard, ranking 14th in the NCAA for ceding just 2.48 per night.
Relative to coach Donato’s squad, the Terriers’ shortcomings on defense essentially negate their advantage on offense, as BU and Harvard sit at No. 15 and No. 16, respectively, in average goal margin (+0.50, +0.43).
In short, the numbers pin Monday’s foes as close competition, and one bounce may be all it takes to decide who moves on to the Beanpot final. This bounce could easily come on the power play, which played a role in last year’s championship tilt, allowing the Crimson to pull away early in the third period.
It’s no surprise that the foes’ special teams numbers shadow their overall offensive and defensive stats. Harvard has a distinct advantage on the penalty kill, placing 17th in the country with a 83.1% kill rate. The Terriers sit all the way at No. 49 in this regard (78.2%). The power play comparison is almost identical, but with the advantage going the other way. BU executes at a 15th-best 21.7% clip, while the Crimson ranks 30 spots below (15.4%).
While both teams have a legitimate shot at advancing on Monday night, there are no easy paths to the Beanpot crown. Coach Donato isn’t mincing words, but is also looking forward to the challenge.
“On the coaches’ side of it, nobody really is looking forward to playing BU right now,” the bench boss said. “One of the reasons why, way back when, we were excited about going into Madison Square Garden or playing at a place like Minnesota on the road is we wanted to expose our guys to situations where there was high stress and the spotlight was pretty bright. Monday night will be one of those times.”
The Beanpot is all about big teams and big stages. And Monday night will see a clash of two teams fighting to revitalize their seasons with all of Boston watching. This year, Harvard will play in a rare “late game,” the 8 p.m. puck drop rather than the 5 p.m. slot. Eight of the last 10 late games have gone to the other tournament teams on account of the larger local crowds they attract.
But with the Crimson back in the public eye after nabbing the Beanpot title last season, the squad will relish the opportunity to play in the more electrifying late-game setting. Harvard’s freshmen, despite having already played at some big-time rinks this season—Lynah, Conte Forum, and Mariucci—will get to experience the full effect of hockey in Boston.
“Especially being the late game for once,” Madsen said wryly, “Just being out there for warmups and having the whole Garden filled while you’re there for warmups, I think right away guys are going to realize what this means.”
Among these freshmen is forward Henry Bowlby, who is making progress in recovering from an illness that sidelined him for six games. The rookie has recorded 10 points (5–5—10) through 15 games this season and still paces his squad in plus-minus.
Bowlby, who was back on the ice for practice this week, could possibly return even before the Beanpot for Friday’s matchup at Dartmouth. Either way, the Edina, Minn., native may provide an extra jolt of offense that the Harvard icemen, victims of two shutouts last weekend, desperately need.
Come Monday, Bowlby will look to a fellow Minnesotan in Horton for inspiration.
“As a freshman…I remember all the seniors were talking about, ‘Oh, Beanpot, Beanpot,’” Horton recalled. “I was like, ‘what are they talking about?’ just being from Minnesota, and now, last year, there was nothing I wanted to win more, except for maybe the Frozen Four.”
Besides, who would want to miss his first Beanpot?
Not Bowlby. Not anybody.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team faces off against Dartmouth tonight as it looks to ink the score sheet for the first time since Jan. 20th against St. Lawrence. The Big Green (9-11-2, 7-7-1 ECAC) is coming off a solid stretch of play that has seen wins over now-No. 4/5 Denver, No. 3 Clarkson, and conference foe Colgate.
Following two shutouts last weekend to No. 1 Cornell and Colgate, the Crimson (9-8-4, 8-5-3) needs a solid performance before its Beanpot matchup with BU on Monday. Because of the Boston hockey classic, Harvard plays just one game this weekend.
Tri-captain Merrick Madsen will man the pipes tonight for the Crimson, and freshman forward Henry Bowlby remains sidelined with an illness. In other roster news, coach Ted Donato '91 has shuffled the defensive pairs, reuniting Wiley Sherman and John Marino, a steadfast pairing last season.

It’s the second week of school. Your math TF has failed you. Again. You’re out of scheduling conflicts to give the course head and just about ready to self-study the class. Don’t give up just yet, these excuses will have you in a new section faster than you can run out of class.
Volunteering Conflict
Sure, they might be able to see what classes you’re enrolled in, but how could your TF possibly know about all the good work you do? Tell them that you have to volunteer somewhere in Boston at 9 a.m. on Tuesdays, so there’s just no possible way you could make their session. If they push back, just let them know how terrible of a person they are for trying to stop your service, and soon enough you’ll find yourself with the hot TF from the other section.
Get a Part-Time Job
If you aren’t working part-time yet, now’s the time to start. If you do get to choose what hours you work, your TF doesn't need to know. Besides, it's not a lie that at 9 p.m. on Fridays, you're the most productive drink-maker. (Even if the drinks aren't Lamcaf cappuccinos.)
Walk onto the Squash Team
Both squash teams seem to be killing the game, so now might be the time to pursue your childhood dream of being a part of the number one college squash team in the nation. Of course, this is about dedication, and the fact that practice happens to conflict with your section is just an unfortunate coincidence.
Flash Daddy’s Credit Card
Honestly, if this applies to you we’re not sure why you can’t just skip section altogether. It's not like your Daddy will care about your GPA when he hires you in a couple years. But hey, if you’re really looking for that transformative experience, batting your eyelash extensions and sweetening the deal with a few J.P. Licks gift cards could win the course head.
Curse your TF
If you're really in a jam...take a weekend day-trip to Salem and purchase some witchcraft tools. Voodoo dolls, ancient scrolls, hexes; something’s gotta work eventually. Then, if your TF happens to become incapacitated for the rest of the semester, you’ll have no choice but to be placed a new section.
