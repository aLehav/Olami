“You know the worst thing about a man hitting you?” Margery says finally. “Ain’t the hurt. It’s that in that instant you realize the truth of what is to be a woman.” In her new novel “The Giver of Stars,” Jojo Moyes asks what society allows women to be. Set in a small Kentucky town in Depression-era America, the novel details the lives of five women who become traveling librarians, delivering books to the people of Kentucky. The story follows Alice Wright, a British woman, who moves after marrying the Kentucky native Bennett Van Cleve. As Alice becomes both dissatisfied with her marriage and small-town life, she joins the group of traveling librarians. In spite of their seemingly inoffensive mission, Alice and the other women begin to disturb the sensibilities of their small town who see their group as a threat — not only to the morals of the town, but also to the laws of nature. Though the “Giver of Stars” falls victim to a formulaic plot, the compelling characters and heartwarming tone make for a captivating read.
The supporting characters and Alice’s relationship to them give this book its heart. Chief among the secondary characters is Margery O’Hare, a kind yet tough individualist — a product of her harrowing childhood life: “If you had survived Frank O’Hare, not much else was going to stand in your way.”  Although born and raised in the area, Margary is seen as the “other” to the people in the town. In fact, all the women of the library are outsiders, or “others,” in their own way. While this causes the town’s scorn to fall on them, it deepens their relationships with one another. This portrayal of female characters is not groundbreaking, but Moyes makes it easy to sympathize with her character’s quest for liberation and the inevitable and predictable obstacles they would overcome.
While the basic tenets of the plot are a bit familiar (readers of books like “The Help” may find it even more so), this inevitability of certain moments, often of male-orchestrated retaliation, makes the story that much more compelling. In one instance, the sole black female librarian is accosted and harassed by a group of drunk white men in the book depository. While violence against women of color during this time period is not unexpected, the use of this experience as a learning moment for the white main character is certainly cliché. Even so, the scene’s seeming inevitability makes it all the more heartbreaking. The retaliation the women face, especially from men, is typical of the book’s time period. In spite of this, there are a few storylines that are refreshing to read. One such storyline involves members of the traveling library working to stop the infringement of mine worker’s rights. Though the trouble this brings is in part because they are women, it is mostly a result of the wider fight against unionization and worker equality.
Despite the seemingly harrowing circumstances the women become tangled up in, the tone of the book remains light as Moyes focuses on the liberation of the women and their triumph in bucking traditional gender roles and expectations. As one character states, “We women face many unexpected challenges when we choose to step outside what are considered are habitual boundaries.” Yet the women in “The Giver of Stars” are always able to overcome the challenges that are put in front of them. While the novel mostly succeeds with this focus, the final, climactic moments of the narrative suffer as a result of it. In the final quarter of the book, the characters are placed in a situation that appears to have no way out. This dire situation the characters find themselves in, however, is quickly and neatly wrapped up due to an unconvincing plot contrivance. While it doesn’t sour the final chapters of the book, the happily ever after ending just doesn’t feel earned. Nevertheless, Moyes is able to create a  heart-warming tale of love, loss, and liberation.

Netflix’s “The Politician” has been one of the most-anticipated shows of the year. It is the first show to debut on Netflix from television superproducer, Ryan Murphy, who signed a $300 million deal with the steaming service last year. Murphy is best known for creating and producing “Glee,” “American Horror Story,” “American Crime Story,” and “Pose” (whose star, Billy Porter, took home the award for “Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series” at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards ). Given the popularity and critical acclaim these shows have enjoyed, it is no wonder that Netflix shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to get access to Murphy’s new content.
Netflix’s bet has largely paid off — “The Politician” has everything you would expect from a Ryan Murphy show: a stellar and star-studded main cast, including Ben Platt, Gweyneth Paltrow, and Jessica Lange; striking production design and cinematography; and many, many references to modern day pop culture.
The series focuses on a wealthy and ambitious high school student named Payton Hobart (Platt) as he runs for student body president. In Payton’s mind, winning student body president is just the first step to one day becoming the actual president of the United States. Payton’s opponent was originally the depressed River Barkley (David Corenswet), but after sad tragedy strikes, River’s rich girlfriend, Astrid Sloan (Lucy Boynton), announces she is taking over River’s campaign and running with Syke Leighton (Rahne Joans), a gender non-conforming black classmate. Payton’s running mate, on the other hand, is sweet Infinity Jackson, who is led to believe she has a diagnosis of terminal cancer by her money-hungry grandmother, Dusty Jackson (Lange).
The election itself is bonkers, involving a staged kidnapping and (multiple!) assissnation attempts. Although much of the show’s plot hovers on the edge of unbelievable, Murphy’s satire successfully parodies the current U.S. political landscape, mirroring our present-day reality of absurd daily political news stories.
In addition to satirizing the circus that is our current political system, “The Politician” highlights the numerous advantages that wealthy students benefit from in other aspects of their lives. Ironically, “The Politician” was written before the Operation Varsity Blues scandal, in which Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were charged with paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to get their children into America’s most selective colleges and universities, amongst many other wealthy parents. So, in the first episode, when Payton’s loving mother, Georgina Hobart (Paltrow), suggests that she will simply buy her son’s way into Harvard University, the plotline feels almost all too real. Precisely because “The Politician” addresses pressing issues in such a creative and funny way, the show is a must-watch.
Part of what makes the show so entertaining is its acting. Platt makes an absolutely incredible lead, proving that he can easily make the leap from Broadway (in 2017, he won a Tony for “Dear Evan Hansen”) to television. Platt did not leave his Broadway roots completely behind, however, as there are a few musical moments in “The Politician.” They are somewhat awkward due to their randomness, but are nonetheless carried by Platt’s magnificent voice.
Paltrow is also particularly good as Georgina Hobart, who, without giving away too much, undergoes a character transformation throughout the season that is sure to be explored in a follow-up season. Lange is as good as always, particularly in a scene in which her character Dusty questions Payton’s motives for choosing her granddaughter, Infinity, as his vice presidential running mate. Shockingly this may, in fact, be Lange’s last television role as she recently told The Hollywood Reporter. Benjamin Barrett’s Ricardo was one performance that disappointed, largely because Ricardo, Infinity’s unintelligent boyfriend, is annoying to the point of being unwatchable and distracting.
What’s strange about “The Politician” is that its first season comprises eight episodes, and yet the penultimate episode of the season is more of a season finale than the actual season finale. That’s because the season finale already sets up Season Two of the series. This turns out to be a smart move as Season Two already anticipates to be more explosive than the first, which is an impressive feat considering how bingeable Season One was. The final episode was so effective in its buildup that viewers were begging for more episodes, but also left many wondering why Season One did not include many more elements of the season finale, particularly the fantastic characters played by veteran actresses Judith Light and Bette Midler. Because the political race set up for Payton at the end of Season One has more significance than that of a student body president election, viewers in some way watched a really long pilot to get to the good stuff. Nevertheless, Season One of “The Politician” still shines on its own, and its second term cannot come soon enough.

As grounded as it is disturbing, Todd Phillips' "Joker" bills itself as a layered character study befitting the titular comic book icon, but falters under the weight of its own astonishingly grand vision. Phillips borrows heavily from the Scorsese films that shaped cinema from the ‘70s to ‘80s (especially "Taxi Driver" and "King of Comedy"). But without the same depth of character development or emotional involvement, "Joker" is often unsatisfying: a recycled empty shell of better, legendary films that neither adds to the masterpieces it's copying from, nor embodies the same emotional resonance that made them successful. What does "Joker" a worthwhile experience, however, is Joaquin Phoenix's sublime central performance.
"Joker" follows Arthur Fleck, an aspiring stand-up comedian whose lifelong dream is to become a talk show host. Socially awkward and marginalized by society, Fleck fantasizes himself being well-loved by everyone — from his next-door neighbor to crowds watching his stand-up gigs. The plot, if it can be called that, and in an effort to prevent spoilers, can be reduced to two exciting incidents, the second of which disproves the first. In other words, Phillips took the premise of Scorsese's "The King of Comedy," scalped half the character development, then stretched the remains over 121 minutes.
With only a handful of scenes that spark empathy (rather than pity) or generate tension in the film's first two acts, "Joker" is often static: 40 minutes in, all Phillips manages to accomplish is sketch a rough outline of Fleck's character (or more fittingly, characteristic). Phillips doesn't stop at one scene to show the audience that Fleck is marginalized for a laughing disorder. Phillips doesn't stop at two scenes. And every such consequential scene is accompanied by a marginal increase in frustration. Phillip's point of repetition, at least, isn't lost: Anyone that suffers such routine tribulations is bound to eventually crack under such pressure. However, with a character that offers so much to unpack, it's questionably inefficient that Phillips chose to onslaught viewers with exposition that at one point was literally written on the screen.
It's easy to argue that one isn't supposed to emotionally follow such a disturbed character. But with gorgeous tracking shots that follow behind Fleck, and uncomfortable close-ups tinted in shades of depersonalizing blue by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, "Joker" perhaps doesn't expect audiences to sympathize with Fleck, but at least expects them to empathize with him. However, that effect isn't fully realized in Phillips' film — possibly due to occasionally unsubtle writing. It's not that it's impossible to follow a protagonist without a moral center, either. Take "Raging Bull," a character study about a hothead so unlikable that he abuses his wife over paranoia she's cheating with his brother, then brawls with his brother over that same unfounded fear. Or Dan Gilroy's recent "Nightcrawler," which follows a sociopath-turned-newscaster who resorts to causing car crashes in order to be the first to film them.
There will be those who say that "Joker" is a rumination on class structure — a critique of the divided, apathetic society we live in today. But it's one thing to balance a timely, subtle criticism of social tension (which Phillips tries so hard to convey) and it's another thing entirely to point at things and say what doesn't work (which is what "Joker" ends up doing). For a film with so much thematic ambition, it's rather disappointing that Phillips settles for hand-holding the audience through the most conspicuous concluding monologue that marginalizing people is wrong.
For its unapologetic commitment to violence and atmospheric paranoia, "Joker" doesn't linger out of the theater like its self-billed, protracted thought-piece suggests either. Some scenes are viscerally shocking and drenched with paranoid tension; the film's conclusion, in particular, is incredible. Phillips' success in short stretches like these makes it all the more striking that his product as a whole is so forgettable. Ultimately, these scenes are too few and far between, and would have been easily elevated with more fleshed-out character motivations.
The true highlight of "Joker" is Phoenix's unflinching performance as the titular character. He embodies the role with a physicality that can at one point perfectly embody unbridled anger, and at others, a deeply humane fear and frustration. Uneasy and alienated as Fleck, but tempestuous and upright as the Joker, Phoenix captures the nuances in character development absent from the screenplay. It's often easy to overstate the gravity of performances in unhinged roles, but Phoenix's achievement is a testament to his growing legacy as an actor.
While "Joker" succeeds in transcending tropes of the superhero genre, it's unfortunately not thorough or original enough to fully realize its goals as a meditation on solitude and marginalization. Phillips should be commended for his approach in turning a superhero film into a grounded character study. Make no mistake, "Joker" isn't simply a comic book film: It’s a drama that wraps around the genre in ways only Nolan's "The Dark Knight" Trilogy and Mangold's "Logan" have before. And granted, there are only so many stories one can tell — especially with a character as complex as Joker — but not all archetypal stories need to feel repetitive. "Ad Astra" took "Apocalypse Now" to space. "Black Panther" is rooted in antiquated Shakespearean tropes. Even James Cameron's technological marvel "Avatar" can be read as "Dances with Wolves" with blue aliens. "Joker" takes "Taxi Driver" from the crime-ridden streets of New York to the crime-ridden streets of Gotham. What's the difference? Phillips plasters the names "Gotham" and "Wayne" somewhere on the screen every five minutes. "Joker" is a story that's been told before, and it's been told better.
Phillips' "Joker" isn't mediocre by any stretch, but it's disappointing that a film with so much potential has accepted that it's a pale imitation of cinematic masterpieces. If its superhero moniker brings mainstream audiences into the world of auteur cinema, then perhaps "Joker" will be looked upon kindly in hindsight. But it's otherwise difficult to think that Phillips may have done injustice to an otherwise well-acted, well-shot feature by thinking too highly of his own film.

On the evening of Oct. 1, the formerly anonymous poet Caroline R. Kaufman ’21 — known on Instagram as @poeticpoison — read selections from her new collection, “When the World Didn’t End: Poems,” for an audience at the Harvard Book Store.
The collection is the follow-up to Kaufman’s debut book “Light Filters In,” an exploration of depression and sexual assault lauded by Kirkus Reviews as “a lifeline for survivors” with an “authentic” authorial voice. HarperCollins published that collection during her first year at Harvard College in the spring of 2018, the same year Her Campus named Kaufman one of their 22 Under 22 Most Inspiring College Women.
According to Kaufman, much has changed in the intervening year and a half. “I was pre-med [then],” she said. “I didn’t really have any idea what I was doing with my life. And now [. . .] I am an English major, and I still have absolutely no idea what I’m doing with my life.”
Kaufman described the time since the release of “Light Filters In” as a surprising survival, the conceit which titles her new book. “When I was struggling the most with mental illness [. . .] I really felt like there was no future for me,” she admitted in her opening remarks. “I created this idea of an apocalypse.”
Kaufman said she was ready for the end, but it didn’t come. “[She] opened up a window and saw that the world was still there,” one of her poems reads. Kaufman’s new collection grapples with the aftermath.
“I think it to myself every day, honestly. Like, what now?” she said. “What am I going to do? How will I live this life?”
Though her poems respond to immense tragedy and trauma, Kaufman made sure to point out that her second collection sports a good sense of “bitterly sarcastic” humor. In one piece which garnered particularly loud chuckles from the crowd, she compared her mediocre self-image to the notoriously mediocre Cleveland, Ohio. Tomasz P. Wojtasik ’21 singled it out as a favorite. “Everyone in the Midwest kind of thinks of Cleveland as, like, a place that exists, but you wouldn’t go [to], unless there was a wedding or something,” said Wojtasik.
Kaufman’s ability to laugh about her struggles with mental health contribute to the sense of forward motion she hopes to create with “When the World Didn’t End.”
“I wanted a reminder that I didn’t have to be angry or upset,” she explained. To serve as that reminder, she writes in one of the last poems of the collection, “If the world is to blame for you losing your way, then the world is to thank for you finding it again.”
Such one-liners have helped Kaufman gain massive popularity on social media: Her Instagram account has almost 200,000 followers. “I actually got an extra copy [of the book] for one of my friends’ little sisters who’s a big fan of hers,” said Erin J. Wright ‘21.
Because most Kaufman enthusiasts have only encountered her work on screens, and many did not know the name of its author (due to her previous anonymity), listening to her speak her own words had a powerful impact on some audience members. “She has a great voice,” said Melissa E. Drake ’21. “It gives it a whole ‘nother dimension.”
Even Kaufman’s parents, Joseph “Joe” H. Kaufman ’89 and Janet B. Korins ’88, only learned their daughter was behind the @poeticpoison account when publishers approached her for a book deal during her junior year of high school. “It was an interesting dinner conversation,” said Korins.
“The whole thing is somewhat perplexing, or surreal,” said Joe Kaufman. He and Korins attended the reading on their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, joining Caroline Kaufman’s cheering section of friends and family which filled the room.

Since the days of Snow White, storytellers have toyed with the concept of mirrors as a gateway to the metaphysical, imbuing them with the power to expose our best-kept secrets. With the release of her fourth studio album, “All Mirrors,” singer-songwriter Angel Olsen earned her place among their ranks. True to its title, the album reflects Olsen’s multifaceted personality with dazzling intensity.
In a drastic shift from the minimalist guitar ballads that propelled her into the public eye, Olsen’s latest work relies on lush orchestration and electronic effects to immerse listeners in a dreamy, futuristic haze. Although artists with backgrounds in alternative music often turn to the glossy predictability of contemporary pop in hopes of expanding their audience, Olsen adamantly refuses to follow the crowd. Instead, “All Mirrors” creates an unsettling, almost esoteric first impression, which many listeners will surely find unpalatable. However, those who remain undeterred by Olsen’s uniquely experimental sound will delight in its kaleidoscopic vibrancy.
Each of the album’s eleven tracks is a study in contradiction: genuine but performative, intimate but far-reaching, repetitive but never dull. In a statement on her Instagram, Olsen acknowledged the “disjointed feelings and verses” of “Lark,” which opens the album with a blur of dissonant strings. Olsen’s voice hovers in the same low register before suddenly leaping an octave and taking on a much more robust, resonant quality. Later on, a series of piercing violin trills interrupts Olsen mid-sentence as a verse tapers off. Although the song’s radical changes in tone likely represent the complexity of human nature, a theme Olsen explores in its lyrics, they produce the effect of disparate excerpts that never form an entirely cohesive whole. The track fades out on a two-note synth motif strangely reminiscent of birdsong, giving listeners yet another idea to contemplate before leaving them in silence.
The eerie atmosphere built by “Lark” continues in the album’s lead single and title track, which puts Olsen’s musical ingenuity on full display. In a daring creative feat, Olsen explores the themes of duality and change with operatic grandeur against a sweeping orchestral backdrop. If “we are all mirrors to and for each other,” as Olsen tweeted after announcing the album, then “All Mirrors” is a meditation on the inevitable erosion of human connections over time. “All mirrors are erasin’,” she intones, her measured conviction lending the phrase a mantra-like energy. The accompanying music video depicts Olsen navigating an otherworldly dreamscape, dressed in a series of extravagant costumes. Her constantly shifting appearance and surroundings reinforce the contrasting and often contradictory aspects of human nature. Given Olsen’s penchant for introspection, it’s no wonder the drums on “All Mirrors” suggest a steady heartbeat.
The album’s remaining tracks showcase the incredible versatility of Olsen’s voice, from whispery falsetto to husky and sonorous belt. Although Olsen begins to incorporate more conventional harmonies and upbeat tempi, the rich instrumental layers prevent any song from veering too far into the realm of pop. Instead, Olsen’s eclectic blend of elements from different genres results in a sound all her own.
Love and relationships are a common motif throughout the album, and many tracks begin with standard declarations of affection. “I’d do anything for you,” Olsen sings in the second verse of “Too Easy.” However, what initially appears to be a run-of-the-mill ballad quickly spirals into an exploration of fate and Olsen’s role in the world. In the end, she leaves listeners with the sense that her real yearning is for something greater. The track concludes on a vague but momentous statement: “I looked around and found something else / Something that was / Bigger than us.”
Although “All Mirrors” will never lend itself to easy interpretation, Olsen’s creative vision is so singular and powerful that every track merits a second listen. Behind each orchestral flourish and theatrical image, her understanding of music’s revelatory potential shines through like a well-polished mirror.

If you happen to be a fan of the tuba, you’ll love Bronwyn. The instrument features heavily in the house band at this trendy, German-themed gastropub, belching out a seemingly endless stream of what one can only assume were chart-toppers in 19th century Bavaria. From your seats in the teeming main dining room, you can’t make out the rest of the band, but judging from the trio of feathered fedoras bopping rhythmically, you conclude that it’s a three-piece: drums, piano, and tuba. Everyone in that dining room knows who the star is, though. Occasionally the drummer goes rogue, kicking off a new song with a funky, modern beat, and the room’s collective ear perks up, but along comes the tuba every time, restoring a festive order to the proceedings.
Bronwyn sits squarely in the corner of Union Square in Somerville, curtains drawn lest passersby see just how much fun is happening inside. It stands out amid a row of hip American eateries with windows big enough for you to catch a glimpse of the identical food they all serve. Union Square is, however, far from homogenous. A 20-minute walk from Harvard Yard into Somerville and one of the densest metropolitan areas in the country, Union Square is an eclectic mix of hipster pubs, Peruvian, Brazilian, and Portuguese restaurants, Korean supermarkets, and the behemoth, historic Barrister’s Hall. Beyond Bronwyn, standouts in the Square include Machu Picchu and Celeste, two upscale Peruvian restaurants, Sarma, which specializes in Mediterranean-inspired small plates, and of course, Union Square Donuts of Harvard study-break fame.
If you make the trek to Bronwyn, though, it’s best to know what to expect. You arrive at the restaurant where a server, clad in semi-traditional German garb, will greet you and usher you to a table. The house special is the Wurst Trio: three German sausages and the accompanying accoutrements of crispy potatoes, sauerkraut, curry ketchup, and spicy mustard. While you wait for your order, you’ll find it hard not to tap your feet along the beat of the drums. You’ll appreciate the collective roar of music and laughter that fills every corner of the crowded space. There are no tables for four here. Instead, everyone sits, German beer tavern-style, at elongated benches that send a not-so-subtle message that you’re supposed to become best friends with the people sitting near you. The energy of the room draws you to a dense crowd of friends who occupied the center of the room. Did they enter the restaurant as a group, or did the benches work their social-engineering magic? That seems to be the least of their concerns as their joyous cries rise and fall and the beer continues to flow. Every so often, a crescendo of cheers emerges from the table, but not because another plate of pretzels or 12-hour smoked bone-in turkey leg is emerging from the kitchen. It is, instead, in response to another lively turn of the tuba. Be aware, when the fedoras finish a cascade of hearty scales and stand to bow to the encouraging crowd, the space seems to be lifted from its foundations by the subsequent applause that will follow.
By the second or third round of applause, your food will have arrived, and first you’ll marvel at the sheer size of the dish. Three traditional German sausages, each a meal on its own, lie nestled a mound of potatoes and sauerkraut. First, bite into the bratwurst, which is the most gamey and meaty of the three. Next, dig into the sharp, acidic sauerkraut and rustic home-fried potatoes in between bites of delectably juicy and plump sausages. After you take a breather from the first sausage, you’ll want to move onto the currywurst, which offers a tender blend of pork meat and just the right amount of curry in the same crisp sausage casing. Here, the sausage stands on its own, spiced to perfection. Finally, as the mountain of food slowly dwindles down, gaze over at the last tasty morsel of meat: the kielbasa. The smoked sausage offers a milder take than the other sausages, so you’ll want to pair it with a healthy portion of mustard sauce in order to bring out the delicate flavors within its casing. While you mop up the remaining vestiges of the sauerkraut with the last of the chunks of potato, take another chance to appreciate the beautiful decor of the room and how perfectly the tastes, sounds, and sights of the cozy space have collided into each other.
Finally, step outside, and while taking in breathfuls of the crisp cold air and adjusting to the surprising silence outside of the restaurant, appreciate how the lingering slow notes of the tuba remain resonating through the night air. As you make your way back to campus, you spy Celeste on the corner, and start thinking about coming back for more.

Nibble Kitchen, a new restaurant in Somerville featuring a rotating international menu prepared by chefs from a wide variety of countries, had its soft opening on Sept. 26. According to the Nibble mission statement, the restaurant focuses on supporting immigrant communities and promoting social justice at a local level.
Nibble Kitchen stems from the broader Nibble program, the culinary division of the Somerville Arts Council. Nibble has previously offered opportunities for culinary entrepreneurs to vend around town at farmers markets and festivals. Their ventures have grown since then, eventually culminating in the creation of a brick and mortar establishment called Nibble Kitchen. Nibble Kitchen is nestled in a corner of Bow Market, a public courtyard with restaurants and shops in the Union Square neighborhood of Somerville. Nibble Kitchen is currently in the midst of its month long soft opening phase.
For many of the chefs, working at Nibble is their first time cooking in a professional setting. Kitchen manager Aly P. Lopez is one of the people who helps them meet American restaurant requirements.
“We want to make sure people understand that there is still an immigrant community in Somerville. As the changes are happening here in the city, we want to make sure that we support those communities,” Lopez said. “[Working at Nibble Kitchen] is important on different levels … for the city to understand that there is this immigrant community that is being pushed away and how beautiful it is.”
The five current chefs working at Nibble come from Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia; each chef is featured at a different time of the week. On Thursday nights, Bolivian chef Sandra Suarez prepares quinoa-based cuisine. The next afternoon, chef Afruza Akther prepares Kati rolls from her native country of Bangladesh, while Friday night features Brazilian street food by chef Robson Lemos. Saturday lunches feature chefs Carolina Garcia and Carolina Salinas, who specialize in Venezuelan arepas. On Saturday nights, chef Meqdes Mesfin makes Ethiopian wots.
“Union Square is changing so much because of gentrification, and one thing that we’ve always loved about Union Square is the diversity — and that’s really evident in the food landscape. So having Nibble Kitchen here is one small way we can preserve diversity in Union Square,” said Rachel M. Strutt, the cultural director of the Somerville Arts Council.
Chef Robson Lemos said the main inspiration for his dishes is the diversity present in his hometown of Bahia, Brazil, where there are people of Portuguese descent, African descent, and indegenous descent.
“Every single dish, every single food has history and has culture,” Lemos said.
He makes acarajés, a cake made of black eyed peas with onions and salt. He tops them with shrimp, salsa, and an Afro-Brazilian peanut sauce called vatapá. He also offers a vegetarian version with loaded Brazilian salsa. His featured drink is a passion fruit juice.
“We share the space, we share the experience, we share the flavor, we share everything,” Robson said about working at Nibble Kitchen.
Chef Sandra Suarez is from Guayaramerin, Bolivia, and specializes in quinoa-based dishes. She serves quinoa fritters with cheddar, spinach, and oats as well as a quinoa tuna sandwich. To drink, she offers quinoa mint horchata.
“I come first with much love and passion, bringing the original flavor of my land, my people, my Bolivian culture in super healthy and nutritious food,” Suarez wrote in an email.
“I think it’s exciting from a customer experience to come on different days of the week and find cuisine from a different part of the planet. I think it keeps it fresh,” Strutt wrote. “But most importantly it gives all our entrepreneurs a day of the week where they can work on their menu [...] and get a taste of what it’s like to run a restaurant. It’s very much a shared kitchen.”
In addition to Nibble Kitchen’s regular restaurant operations, it will also host culinary classes and events. Culinary coordinator Judy Yao will be heading the culinary classes, and she also plans Nibble events, like the upcoming Nov. 1 celebration for Dia de los Muertos.
“[Nibble] provides a space for our entrepreneurs to share their passion for food and their culture and their love for their history with the Somerville and greater Boston community. And so we’re fostering both the economic aspect of it — of folks being able to pursue their dreams and make a living — and also fostering cultural integration and connection with the local community,” Yao said.
Strutt agreed. “I think food brings people together and it gets people talking,” she said. “I think it will promote multiculturalism. That’s the hope.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
15 years ago, Green Day released the self-proclaimed “punk rock opera,” “American Idiot.” The seventh of the California-based group’s 12 studio albums, “American Idiot” reignited Green Day’s popularity with a younger audience after their previous album, “Warning,” failed to achieve the same commercial success as their earlier albums. The Grammy award-winning LP exemplifies the feelings of disillusionment and insignificance felt by many during the aftermath of 9/11 and the beginning of the Iraq War. Today, “American Idiot” is still as politically relevant as ever.
“American Idiot” is a concept album that tells the story of the Jesus of Suburbia, an adolescent looking for something bigger than the life he is living in an inescapable small town. Although originally written as a middle finger in the face of the Bush administration, the album continues to hold merit in 2019 during another, maybe more so, politically tumultuous era. The band’s lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong changed the lyrics in the title track “American Idiot” from “I’m not part of a redneck agenda” to “I’m not part of a MAGA agenda” at the 2019 iHeartRadio Music Festival, demonstrating that “American Idiot” is an everlasting and adaptable song (and album) intended to hold a mirror up to the country’s political climate.
“Jesus of Suburbia” is a nine minute track split into a series of vignettes that depict the boring, small town life of the concept album’s lead character and his decision to leave for the big city. The life of the Jesus of Suburbia exemplifies those of people stuck in suburban wastelands, both in 2004 and today. Green Day empathizes with those born, raised, and trapped in small, lower-income towns where the education system has failed the locals, the government ignores — or in the case of Flint, Michigan, poisons — those in need. It is an anthem to all the hometowns where everyone knows everyone’s name and business, and no one aspires to leave.
On “Holiday,” a classic example of head-banging rock music, the chorus “I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies / This is the dawning of the rest of our lives / On holiday” reflects a refusal to be complicit in the atrocities perpetrated by the government. During the bridge, Armstrong refuses to comply with an administration which he sees to be aligned with a fascist regime. “Holiday” holds some of the most political relevance today of any song released in the early 2000’s. “Holiday”’s comparison of congresspeople to Nazis has, unfortunately, aged well. The distaste for the political climate of 2004 is mirrored today by adolescents who are at the frontlines of protests calling for political action like Greta Thunberg and Emma González. These are the earthly saints that a motivated Jesus of Suburbia could be — the ones Green Day said the world needed through this album.
While some songs on the album actively protest the politics of the early 2000’s and today, “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” “St. Jimmy,” and “Give Me Novacaine” exhibit the effects of these tumultuous times on the masses. “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” Green Day’s most commercially successful song, speaks to those who feel alone despite being surrounded by people. “St. Jimmy” and “Give Me Novacaine” reflect a desire to be distracted from reality. On these two songs, the protagonist finds himself searching for answers to his life’s problems in hard drugs, sex, and bad decisions in the same way that adolescents today over indulge in social media, niccotine, and mediocre alcohol.
Fifteen years, one Grammy, a Broadway musical adaptation, and being cemented as Green Day’s first number one album in the United States later, “American Idiot” remains as politically relevant and relatable as it was in the early 2000’s. With its themes of disillusionment and desire for revolution, “American Idiot” will remain resonant until the day the United States is no longer split across party lines, the members of the human race are no longer at war with one another, there is an end to our drug epidemic, those who live in suburbia can successfully find their way out, and those raised in big cities no longer become jaded.

In the cramped-yet-cozy space of the Middle East Upstairs, Mallrat, accompanied by two supporting artists, Japanese Wallpaper and Allday, filled the hearts of her audience on Sept. 27 with her spunky, tongue-in-cheek delivery and relaxed, carefree aura.
A live set is not always conducive to facilitating an intimate experience with an artist, but Mallrat’s dreamy, organic stage present felt less like a scripted recital and more like like an impromptu dorm room sing-along with a close friend — making the performance uniquely personal.
Japanese Wallpaper, the first opener of the night’s trifecta of Austrailian indie artists, had the wherewithal to continue the show through some technical difficulties. With energetic guitar strumming contrasting his calm demeanor, the musician kicked off the casual mood of the night with “Cocoon,” proceeding to play his new release “Tongue Tied,” among others. It is typical to feel the rush of a beat through your chest, but unnervingly exceptional to experience this feeling alongside the artist in real time. Japanese Wallpaper’s lyrics “Though my feet don’t touch the floor / It’s the way I fall to the ground” evoke this sensation.
Allday picked up right where Japanese Wallpaper left off, slowly marking the transition from standard indie-rock to more eclectic variations of the genre. Incorporating Japanese Wallpaper on the keys, Allday intertwined hallmarks of rap with the soft lilts of an Australian accent on tracks “Right Now,” “Sides,” “Lungs,” and a collaboration with Wallpaper, “In Motion.” Allday bounced around the stage, brimming with the fervor of having something pressing to say, and continued to convey this in the song “Restless”: “Where did this come from darling? / Out of the blue / Did you only love me when you had nothing else to do?” In the vein of authenticity, he acknowledged his unpolished performance style: “It’s fucking illegal for you to laugh at my dance moves!” he said.
When Mallrat graced the stage, she was warmly welcomed — both by the audience and the mellow glow of carefully-colored lighting. Her delightfully simple and unperplexing lyrics do a favor for newcomers who might not know the lyrics by heart, thus making the performance accessible for dedicated fans and newbies alike.
Relatability that feels genuine can be difficult ground to navigate, but Mallrat accomplishes it seamlessly with her deadpan take on rap-singing and unchoreographed, haphazard shrugs and hair tosses, not with attitude, but with humble self-assurance.
In between carefree pirouettes, Mallrat started off her set with “Sunglasses,” one of her earlier songs. She played it raw and syncopated, and when she sang, “Everyone around you wears the same sun-glass-es,” her appreciation for originality shone not just in her lyrics but also in her unique delivery. In “When I Get my Braces Off,” she perfectly embodied the restless yet awkward nature of the teen spirit with repetitions of the lyric “I bet you hate what I like,” each iteration sung with a distinct flavor of sardonic angst.
In “Nobody’s Home,” a punchier song and Mallrat’s closest intersection with full-on pop, she still managed to interpolate her deadpan delivery into manufactured beats. Her smooth, understated murmurs enthralled while she rushed the line, “Maybe it's not about me and what I wanna see / Let me know what you want it to be” in one monotone breath before the beat drop.
“Charlie,” a tender song welcoming Japanese Wallpaper back onstage for acoustic accompaniment, showcased Mallrat’s performative range. She channeled the subtleties of independence and newness in ways she had not explored in her prior songs. As she sang, “I just want coffee for breakfast / I just want warm cups of tea / I just might love you forever / I hope you warm up to me,” the lights glowed without flushing out the stage, all while Mallrat transformed the mundane into the meaningful.
Towards the end of the show, Mallrat confessed that the length of her performance was limited by her small repertoire. But she is a testament to the fact that it is neither length nor perfection, but rather everything undeliberate that makes a live performance so much richer than a recording. The spur-of-the-moment, nuanced exhibition of a budding artist’s creative potential unfolding onstage was fulfilling enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Known as “the man who shot the ’70s,” Mick Rock is a living legend in the world of music photography. Even if you don’t recognize his Dickensian name, you’ve definitely seen his iconic photos, including one of the most recognizable images of Queen, the famous bubble bath shot of Motley Crue, and his portraits of David Bowie. In his interview, he shared countless stories laden with literal music history, as well as wise musings on finding one’s passion. He will be appearing in Behind the Lens at Boston City Winery on Oct. 7.
This article has been edited and condensed for clarity. 
The Harvard Crimson: What’s the coolest experience you’ve had shooting photographs, or what was something you never expected to turn out the way it did?
Mick Rock: I never expect anything. But I know it will turn out fine because everything always does — just one of those weird things, you know? Fate has its role to play. For me, the most recent shoot is always the one that’s hottest in my mind … People say, “What’s your favorite photograph, Mick?” Well, I don’t know, it depends on the air of the day, the day of the week, the month of the year, and whether or not I’m having my period — because if I’m having my period that could put a whole different cast on things!
THC: How have changes in the music industry over the years impacted you?
MR:  I just shoot the same as I always shot. I don’t think about things like that. I mean, people are either going to love ‘em or they’re not. So, I don’t know. I mean, obviously the digital change has changed a lot of things and I love digital. I think that it gives you so much flexibility. One is you can see what you’re up to, always. Two, you can show them to people quickly. Three, if you want to send a shot to outer Mongolia, you can do it within about three minutes of actually taking the pictures. Obviously you’ve got to know someone in outer Mongolia and I actually don’t … When I go out, I don’t take a bloody camera with me, I take my phone like everybody else. But if you want me to bring a camera, you’d better have a little stash of gold in your hand to prime me with. That’s not totally true, but I like to say it.
THC: How do you think you stumbled into photography and if you hadn’t, what do you think you would be doing?
MR: I don’t know what I’d be doing. I know what my parents thought I would probably be doing. I’d gotten a scholarship to Cambridge University in England and they thought I was going to go there and be very sensible, get my degree and maybe become a lecturer. And that wasn’t what I had in mind. I really wasn’t interested in a career, I was interested in an adventure. And a fucking adventure is what I got, for good and for bad.
I picked up a friend’s camera on an acid trip — that’s what got me rolling into photography. And it got me very excited, the explosions. I mean, I was really high. Every time I clicked, you got this kind of explosion, and then, every time there was a click, everything changed. I was mostly photographing this young lady and her face went through a million different changes. And after that I was just curious about it. I wasn’t really thinking, “Oh I’m going to be a photographer.” … And the musicians, well it didn’t pay very much money but so what? I got to do what I wanted to do. And it kind of grew — such that now my old rock and roll pictures are worth a lot … Just David Bowie in 1972, if you think of that alone, forget even about Freddie, and Lou Reed, and Debbie, and Rocky Horror, and Syd Barrett, and the Ramones, and the Sex Pistols… If it was alive, I would probably shoot it back in those days.
THC: What’s one moment you wish you’d captured on film?
MR: I do remember being at a party and John Lennon was there and I was introduced to him and I was kind of in awe. This is probably late ‘70s, I mean it had to be, because when was he shot, 1980? And I was thinking of shooting but somehow I couldn’t do it. It’s a weird thing, I know, but it kinda froze me, so I do remember that. But mostly if I wanted to shoot it, I’d shoot it and not think too hard about it. Because you can’t think too hard. The thing about photography is, it’s not an intellectual pursuit, it’s a totally visceral, intuitive thing. And even though I’ve shot for Gucci and that tends to be a bit more mapped out, most of the pictures I’ve shot I was the art director as well. The famous Queen shot, that’s all Mick Rock. I came up with the idea, I shot it, I organized them, I got the lighting, I did everything.
THC: How did you work with artists who had their own creative vision for the shot?
MR: Mostly they just let me get on with it. David was very good. He could take direction very well … And Freddie. And today, of course, I’ve been around so long that I have a certain, shall we say, reputation, so going in people, they expect me to provide the magic. And of course I do. Because that’s my job.
THC: When working with artists more than once, how did you keep up the magic for a second shoot? How did you come back with something new?
MR: I just did it … And I don’t know, it always works. Don’t ask me why. Obviously somebody up there was sprinkling fairy dust on me, or was it cocaine? I’m not sure, it was a bit of both. You have to understand I haven’t touched anything (well I have a little marijuana sometimes) in 23 years. When you have quadruple bypass heart surgery, as I did in the Christmas of ’96, it’s very painful. So, people said to me afterwards, “Don’t you feel tempted?” And I said, “No, I don’t feel fucking tempted!” What I went through was very uncomfortable and I don’t want to duplicate it. And I’ll tell you, in 2012, also at Christmastime, I had a kidney transplant. So, God has given me a couple of whacks upside the head just to remind me: Don’t be a dick, Mick.
THC: So when you work with artists like Andy Warhol who aren’t musicians, does that change the dynamic?
MR: It doesn’t really change anything … I mean, Andy was a bit different because Andy was Andy! I do remember though, shooting him and Truman Capote for a High Times cover many many, many years ago and going to the Factory. And the Factory was then on Union Square in the middle of New York and it was a mess. The space he let us shoot in was a fucking mess. And I was bouncing up and down because I’m fairly bouncy when I shoot and at some point he said to me, “Excuse me, Mick,” and I’d been doing it for a while and he must’ve realized it before, but he was just pointing out that I was jumping up and down on a bunch of canvases. I mean they were rolled canvases you wouldn’t have known what they were. And I thought, “Oh, really? Might be a million dollars under my feet.” But I remember his attitude, he wasn’t really that bothered he just thought I might like to know.
THC: Who were your biggest inspirations for your work?
MR: I remember having a period, and that would have been back in the ‘80s, where I’d spray backgrounds to my photographs. But at that period I was interested in Jackson Pollock, notwithstanding the fact that he died a horrible death and killed somebody else in a car crash. Nevertheless, for me, he’s probably the greatest American artist, unbelievable. Strange fellow, but his art was fantastic. I like Man Ray. I wasn’t really interested in photographers when I started out but when I discovered Man Ray I thought, “Oh, he’s got the same initials as me!” Of course, I’m a tall, lanky Londoner, his real name was Emmanuel Radnitzky and he was a short Jewish guy from Philadelphia. Not that I have a little bit of Jewish in me, I’ve got a little bit of all kinds of stuff in me. I’m a hybrid. I’ve got Sicilian in me, too. I think the Sicilian in me takes the photographs, like a hit man.
So, [being a photographer is] obviously what I was meant to do. I’ve had people ask me, “Oh Mick, I wish I had this and I wish that,” but my first question to them is one, what do you do and two, are you good at it? I remember a guy who was an accountant and he went on and on and on (I think he’d had a few drinks) and he regaled me, “I always wanted to be a photographer.” I said, “What do you do?” He said, “Well, I’m an accountant.” And I said, “Well, are you any good at it?” He said, “Oh yeah, I’m a really good accountant. Do you need one, Mick?” And I said, “That’s what you’re meant to be doing.” If you’re really good at something, that’s what you’re supposed to be doing in life, you know? Don’t worry about what anyone else is up to, because that’s their problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a cool Saturday night at the Rockland Trust Bank Pavillion. Southern folk-rock bands Calexico and Iron and Wine opened, performing songs from their recent joint album, “Years to Burn,” with multiple guitar changes, a cowboy hat, and an artfully-lit glass of wine. Their performance set the tone for the main act, singer-songwriter Andrew Bird — a classically-trained violinist who combines influences from folk, jazz, and blues to develop an eclectic indie sound.
The lights came up, revealing a projection of Bird’s shadow cast across a cartoon-style, free-standing prop door toward the back of the stage. Bird made his entrance through the prop door to swelling instrumentals, dressed in a white suit jacket and black skinny jeans, violin in hand. He bounded up to the center mic and launched into whistling the intro to “Sisyphus,” the first track off his twelfth album, “My Finest Work Yet,” released this past March.
Bird proceeded to play the first half of the album with expansive energy, singing close into the mic and rising on his toes as if pulled upward by the music. He navigated his violin with the easy hands of an expert, alternately strumming, plucking, and bowing with such force that stray strands dangled from the bow. For some songs, he set the violin aside in favor of an acoustic-electric guitar.
Bird’s live performance showcased the technical elements of his music. Using looping and effect pedals — and, occasionally, an additional mic — Bird layered wave upon wave of whistling, singing, and instrumentals.
After the first half of “My Finest Work Yet,” Bird took a break from the new album to play two songs off his 2016 album “Are You Serious,” including “Roma Fade,” one of his most popular songs.
After plunging into the second half of “My Finest Work Yet,” Bird paused to introduce his song[ “Manifest,” speaking to the environmentalist thread of the album. “This song is appropriate for the last week of the climate strike,” Bird said. “I once heard a guy trying to explain — he was a bit high, I think — he was saying that oil is the blood of the earth. I don’t know if the earth is a living thing, but it’s a miracle that it all hangs together, and we should do our best not to fuck it up.”
Following “Bellevue Bridge Club,” the final song of the new album, Bird gathered around a single mic at the front of the stage with Madison Cunningham (guitarist and vocalist) and Allan Hampton (bassist and vocalist) for a small set of songs with a more intimate folk sound. After the three-part harmonies of “Give It Away,” Bird said “Now we’re gonna play a little duet, Madison and I,” launching into the opening line of “Left-Handed Kisses” to a roaring round of applause. Bird and Cunningham sang their alternate parts, joining together for the chorus. Audience cheering filled the brief spaces between lines.
Nearing the end of the set, Bird stepped back and Cunningham took center stage to perform her song “Something to Believe In.” She stood before the mic without her guitar, pouring all her energy into piercing vocals that filled the pavillion, as Bird and the rest of the band played background instrumentals.
Bird closed the set with “Capsized,” shaking and bobbing his head to the disco-rock beat. He and his band exited the stage, leaving the crowd cheering and waiting, anticipating more to come. It wasn’t long before Bird came back out for the encore, joking that the show wouldn’t be complete without a song from his 2005 album, “The Mysterious Production of Eggs.” The roar from the crowd confirmed his intuition. Bird and his band then played “Tables and Chairs,” ending the night with the environmentalist message of earlier, packaged in a satirical song with the steady, feel-good beat of a closer.

On Sept. 27, the Artists for Humanity Epicenter in Boston hosted Red Bull’s Beantown Uprising, a festival event sponsored by the energy drink brand with the hopes of celebrating the city’s influence in the hip-hop industry.
The music line-up consisted of Boston’s most beloved hometown artists, including Cousin Stizz, Michael Christmas, and collective Van Buren. Boston businesses also partnered with the event, and Bodega — a local streetwear shop — built an art installation of a convenience store in homage to the entrance of their own iconic Boston shop.
As the crowd filed into the venue, many formed a line for Bodega’s free custom t-shirt table. The limited edition shirts were exclusive to the Beantown Uprising event, and had the musical acts and brand sponsors located on the back. The public was allowed to choose from various decals such as roses and bedazzled Red Sox logos to create their own unique wearable souvenirs of the night.
The first act of the night was Van Buren, a collective rap group hailing from Brockton, Mass. In a sudden flurry of movements, all the members got on stage and began to dance erratically as one member took the mic and rapped. Lord Felix — a Van Buren member — was raging and throwing himself from one side of the stage to the other. At one point, he brought a fan wearing his iconic visor up on stage to jam out with the group.
Michael Christmas performed shortly after. Christmas began by telling the crowd why the event was so important to him.
“Don’t make me emotional now, but I’m in a room filled with my family,” Christmas said.
Christmas performed many of his more recognizable songs, like “Honey Berry,” and also added four previously unperformed pieces to his set. During his performance, Christmas asked the crowd to split into opposite sides, which clashed together and erupted a mosh pit in the center of the floor.
Concert goer Frederick Ramos was impressed by the venue and the artist lineup.
“I like the aspect, like it’s a gallery,” Ramos said of the location. Various canvases of contemporary and modern artworks hung across the venue.
When asked about the artists that would be performing later on in the night, Ramos mentioned his special ties with the Van Buren collective.
“I went to highschool with a couple of them so it’s cool seeing them out here, you know, making waves,” Ramos said.
Van Buren member Lord Felix also said that the concert venue appealed to him, and that he wants to give his fans the best experience possible.
“This is what I want my shows to be likewhen I start doing more bigger shows. I want them to be an experience,” Lord Felix said. “They have the t-shirts over there, they got fucking caterers. It’s dope.”
With the support of his family and friends behind him, Lord Felix said he wants to put the best of himself on the stage.
“I know they’re going to turn up with me, so I’m going to feed off everyone’s energy. I always give it my all every performance anyways, but this is like an extra boost,” he said.
Throughout the night, DJ duo Bearly Yvng continued to remind the crowd of the importance of the evening and what the festival embodied.
“What we try to do is to lift up the culture of Boston,” the MC said.

On Oct. 3, at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, three artists gathered to speak to a group of a hundred attendees about the importance and preservation of artistic integrity.
The panel consisted of Jill Scott, a three-time Grammy Award winning recording artist and actress; Paloma Valenzuela, the creator of La Gringa Loca Productions and the web series “The Pineapple Diaries”; and Oompa, an acclaimed rapper and poet. The panel was moderated by Arielle Gray, an arts producer at WBUR and a writer and multimedia artist herself.
The event began with a panel discussion, moderated by Gray, which focused on the importance of artistic integrity and the situations that have tested that integrity for each panelist. The panelists were seated in a circle facing each other on the lowest level of the Gardner museum’s Calderwood Hall.
When discussing what artistic integrity meant to them, the panelists turned to the topic of personal accountability.
“For me, artistic integrity is about whether or not I can sleep next to myself that night,” Oompa said.
Scott added that for her, integrity means “holding onto your soul at all costs.”
When asked how personal experiences have tested their integrity, the panelists mentioned that integrity is always tested when in a professional artistic industry. Oompa said that in her experience, integrity is tested “when you think about yourself explicitly as a business.”
“I don’t want it to get away from me so far that it becomes something that isn’t anything I can recognise anymore,” Valenzuela said.
The artists also said their integrity is tested by their own audiences, particularly when fans ask them to steer their art in a certain direction.
“I want to speak your language without compromising my own,” Oompa said.
The evening next opened to a Q&A, allowing the audience members to contribute to this “Larger Conversation” themselves. Then Gray ended the panel with a summary of the importance of artists maintaining their own integrity.
“When you find yourself compromising your vision for what other people want, you end up with regret, and that is the worst thing to live with as an artist,” she said.
The audience cheered in response to most of the panelists’ answers, consistently murmuring in agreement. Many audience members said they came to the event not due to an association with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, but instead due to an appreciation for the panelists’ careers.
“I’ve always looked up to Jill Scott. She’s always been a positive role model,” said Bostonian and audience member Constance A. Smith. “Especially growing up as a fuller figured woman and in pursuing a career of being a pull-sized model.”
Audience members also said they resonated with the message of maintaining authenticity to maintain integrity.
“One thing that was said that really struck me was, ‘You can step in someone’s shoes but you can’t step in their feet.’ I think that’s a particularly striking statement because sometimes we as artists try to emulate each other to gain notoriety,” X. Alexander Durden, an attendee and actor, said. “So to be able to step in one's own genuineness is something that is worth being reminded of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Elizabeth Harris, known by the stage name “Cupcakke” (stylized as CupcakKe) is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, and online philanthropist who hails from Chicago, Illinois. She is known for music that is audaciously sexual and vulgar.
After an unexpected public twitter rant — which has since been deleted — about music artists Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes, CupcakKe took to Instagram to deliver the shocking announcement that she has decided to retire from music in the form of an almost 19-minute live video.
Through tearful eyes, CupcakKe explains that she was “torn apart” seeing young kids in her audience singing along to her vulgar lyrics, she explains —finding trouble to speak in the midst of her tears — that she’s “corrupting them with my songs.” She says she is sorry to let all her fans down and that this is not a publicity stunt to “get streams” on her albums. To further prove that this is not an outcry for attention, she explains that all her albums are coming down soon.
Beyond being disappointed with herself and the influence she has on her younger audience, she also explains the personal difficulties — especially the limitations that arise from her lyrics that are famed for being explicitly sexual and over the top. She talks about how she’s put out songs about many different subjects, from “being homeless” to “supporting the LGBT community,” yet she will always be considered “untalented because that’s the girl who made ‘Deepthroat’” and thus, will forever be considered a joke with nothing real or important to say.
CupcakKe also describes the pressure of rapping about sexuality while not conforming to society’s traditional standards of beauty, and how difficult it is to hear people call her overweight and not representative of the beauty and sexuality that her songs display. She later explains that even if she “change[s] the content — with me being my size, no one will support me.”
Many of the comments on her Instagram video critique the announcement for being abrupt and surprising. She was in the midst of a tour called “The $10k Tour” that she explains will be cut short because of her retirement. Indeed, this announcement came on September 22, 2019 — just eight days after performing at Boston’s Paradise Rock Club on Sept. 14 as the headliner on her tour, as well as making a stop at Princeton’s “Lawn Parties” on Sept. 15 — their “Yardfest” equivalent.
She seems pretty adamant on this being a final end, saying that this is not “a[n] ‘I’m done now’ situation and then two weeks later she’s dropping a song, or a month later she’s dropping a song, or three months later [she’s dropping a song]. I am completely done with music. I want to be normal again.” She hammers in the point that this is it for her, and ends the video by thanking her fans for their support.
As of now her Instagram account has been deactivated, and although her Twitter remains active, she hasn’t posted anything since the video went live. Her music is still live on streaming platforms and her music videos are still up on Youtube.
It’s unclear what exactly prompted this. It could be related to the spotlight that was placed on her for attacking the hugely popular Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes, but even her most active followers felt that the announcement came out of nowhere.
Although CupcakKe is retiring and supposedly not releasing any new content, she left her mark in music and potentially society at large. Her songs were generally viewed as comedic for their excessively sexual nature, but she was able to express sexaul progressiveness, openness, and body positivity through them. She may see her lyrics as corrupting, but in many ways she was able to relate the message of an important dialogue: how sheltered we are from conversations about sex and the self-expression of body language. Perhaps her overtly sexual lyrics were able to bring attention to society’s fears and discomfort around the language of sex. She may have been able to impact younger generations’ attitudes towards sexual positivity, causing them to wonder why we are so embarrassed when discussing these topics, and hopefully leading to more comfort around their discussion.

Imagine if your tea had magic powers. Perhaps you’re not a tea drinker and would prefer a mystical smoothie, chocolate bar, or cocktail to take off the edge after a hard day’s work. With new CBD-infused drinks and delectables popping up in cafes and restaurants around the country, that reality might be a lot closer than you think — and it’s driven, largely, by a desire for that chic CBD aesthetic.
While there are plenty of documented health benefits, today’s marketing makes CBD products seem more aesthetically pleasing than medicinally useful. This branding, particularly appealing to social media-savvy young adults, has contributed to CBD’s newfound popularity and helped make CBD products increasingly accessible for a more diverse range of consumers.
From food to beauty products, this cannabinoid has diversified in industry and form. As a pure oil, its taste can be far from ideal. Edibles like CBD-infused gummy bears and cookies, however, improve not only CBD’s taste but also its brand. Like the weed lollipop vendor stationed on your corner, companies are churning out CBD products in just about every commercial form imaginable and oftentimes, in like appearance to favored non-CBD products. Some CBD foods, like Froot Proofs Breakfast Cereal and Flaming Hot Weetos, play explicitly with themes of beloved childhood treats and guilty pleasures, while others, like CBD instant matcha and Honey Pot feed into foodie trends and healthful living fads.
So how did CBD get so trendy that it’s taking over our cereal, you wonder?
The legalization of industrial hemp in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 opened up an entirely new swath of industry. With Americans’ growing public support for marijuana legalization (at 62 percent in 2018, according to a Pew research poll) and an interest in cannabis-derived products, the potential market for such an industry seems to have already been relatively clear. Of course, marijauna and hemp differ; CBD, which as a hemp product has less than 0.3 percent THC, can’t get you high (contrary to the popular misconception). The widespread association of CBD with marijuana — what I’m dubbing the “placebo weed effect” — could, however, be a meaningful factor in its rise to fame.
Plus, CBD really can relax you, even if it’s not going to induce hallucination or trigger the munchies. This calming capacity gives CBD an intergenerational appeal; an arthritic grandma might benefit from CBD as much as her stressed-out teenage granddaughter. As per beauty products, CBD falls right in line with the “natural” brand (the idea being something like “if it comes from a plant, it’s probably good to have in an eye cream”). For believers in alternative medicine and herbal remedies, CBD products are also quite a compelling sell, as CBD often seems to be branded as a cure-all.
What really seems to make CBD in vogue, though, is how well it fits into an aesthetic-obsessed popular culture. CBD products can help build your personal brand: You can post pictures of your chic CBD chai latte at your local vegan cafe or share CBD chocolates packaged with rainbow unicorn decor. These products, designed to make you want to promote them, help curate what feels like an almost rebellious act of openly doing the formerly taboo while also feeding into the mainstream “good vibes only” mentality.
Those who use CBD to relieve pain or to treat physical and mental health conditions, from epilepsy and arthritis to anxiety and depression, might find the trendiness of CBD products tokenizing or even misleading, playing only to specific demographics. Yet even as CBD branding can emphasize a more superficial and mainstream use, raising awareness of the accessibility of CBD products can have widespread effects. The more people hear about CBD, the more those could benefit from its use may be likely to try it out. And the more common — trendy, even — that CBD products become, the less of a stigma there may be around using them. It seems that promoting CBD in any way can positively impact more people than follow our Instagram accounts, but we should remain cognizant that CBD use can have very different implications for different people.
For some, trying CBD products proves transformative while for others, it can be a fairly meaningless but harmless experience. Either way, the potentially great benefits of CBD use make some experimentation seem worthwhile! Already, restaurants around Boston are providing their own hot takes on CBD (at Bodega Canal, you can enjoy your tortilla chips with CBD-infused guac). CBD products are also available in hemp stores and online, although you should always verify the legitimacy of CBD brands prior to purchase. (Online resources can make this very doable).
There’s no way to know whether the CBD trend will stick. But, for now, the CBD tea has been spilled and it's up to consumers, whatever their motivations, to decide if the next cup is right for them.

If you have watched “The Irishman” trailer, you may think that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino took a dip in the Fountain of Youth in order to portray younger versions of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Quite the contrary: they were “de-aged” using a relatively new computer-generated imagery (CGI) technique. Although “de-aging” CGI technology has been around since 2006 and has since been used in films such as “Rogue One,” in which the likeness of a young Carrie Fisher is brought back in Ingvild Delia’s portrayal of Princess Leia, “de-aged” characters have never dominated the screen the way they do in “The Irishman." To some, the use of “de-aging” technology might seem demonstrably problematic, while others might view it as a valuable resource, opening up a new horizon of opportunities for film production.
On one hand, “de-aging” could extend the career lengths of actors who stopped receiving roles due to losing their youthful “look” with age. Actresses are particularly subject to prematurely truncated acting careers since the majority of their potential roles are offered before they turn 30. Of course, there are exceptions like Maggie Smith or Betty White; however, not all actresses get the chance to be consistently cast in TV and film even in old age. Although “de-aging” technology could combat the disproportionate treatment of actresses in casting, this approach calls into question whether it is accommodating the issue rather than addressing it. It is reasonable to argue that the standard for actresses should instead change. That is, the notion of aging women acting in leading roles should be normalized.
“De-aging” technology provokes an entirely new ethical parameter within the entertainment industry. For example, the deepfake technology that is involved in “de-aging” techniques could be problematic if someone’s likeness were used without their consent. In these instances, the use of digital “de-aging” should be examined with reference to digital media laws. Additionally, should digital entertainment producers be compelled to disclose when de-aging technology is used? With this in mind, this technology seems fairly similar to the use of photoshop on models in fashion magazines.
With “de-aging” and deepfake technology as a whole becoming more prominent in film, one could imagine that quality actors will become increasingly valuable, and conventional attractiveness will matter less and less. In spite of having heavy implications and nuanced ethical considerations, “de-aging” technology seems to be largely useful with potential to become omnipresent within the film industry.

When it comes to movie trailers going completely off the rails, Robert Eggers’ “The Lighthouse” takes the cake. And the cookies. And probably the ice cream, too. Starring recent indie movie darling (and future Batman) Robert Pattinson alongside resident wacko Willem Dafoe, the A24 film is a tale of two lighthouse keepers on a remote New England island in the 1890s. It is Eggers’ second feature film since his critically acclaimed 2015 horror, “The Witch,” another period piece that plays out like a fever dream. A two-hander shot in black-and-white, “The Lighthouse” is a radical film, with a nearly square aspect ratio that has hardly been used since the 1930s. Judging from the trailer, it’s Jules Verne, Hitchcock, “Moby-Dick,” and Shakespearean rage all rolled into one weird hypnotic ball of delicious mano a mano strife.
The trailer opens with A24’s signature aesthetic relish. The company’s logo flickers white against a black backdrop and the sound of a foghorn blares. A silvery shot of a lighthouse on a tiny, rocky island comes into view looking more like vintage footage than a 21st century movie. A bass lows ominously as Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe stare into the camera. With sunken eyes and sallow cheeks, they look like weathered 19th century sailors. Dafoe cuts a Captain Ahab-esque figure with a rugged, silvery beard, looking ready to share his preternatural knowledge that a storm’s a–comin’.
In the candlelit claustrophobia of the lighthouse, Dafoe holds a pipe and asks why a timberman like Pattinson wants to be a “wickie,” an old term for a lighthouse keeper, deriving from their duty to trim the wicks of the lighthouse oil lamps. It starts getting weird between the two men when Dafoe asks if Pattinson is keeping secrets. We get a shot of Pattinson digging a grave, followed by a shot of him peering in at Dafoe from a door cracked open. They guzzle down alcohol and dance together, then huddle beneath a table when the window above them is blown through with water. What sounds like a riotous old sailor’s ditty is sung in rounds in the background. Meanwhile, Dafoe repeats, “Why’d you spill your beans?” in voiceover until it takes on an incantatory quality.
Stuff hits the fan when Dafoe lets out a wail of biblical proportions. There is axe-wielding, tentacles, mutual strangulation, a grotesque underwater woman, and a whole lot of A24 horror madness. Finally, the music cuts out and Dafoe delivers a line that has already captured the meme-makers’ imaginations: “How long have we been on this rock? Five weeks? Two days? Help me to recollect.”
For a trailer that’s only a minute and a half long, it opens up a can of crazy to last a lifetime. And from the looks of it, Pattinson and Dafoe are the perfect ingredients for a pressure cooker film like “The Lighthouse.” So here’s to A24’s good health, and to a truly bizarre performance pairing we never knew we needed.

Sept. 20 saw the opening of the “Downton Abbey” film to much fanfare, including a $31 million opening weekend. After a six-season run that spanned from 2010 to 2015, viewers were simply too attached to the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants to let things end with a series finale. The movie serves as a 122-minute long excursion for audiences, back to the sparkly version of interbellum England created by Julian Fellowes as Downton Abbey — the titular estate — prepares for a visit from King George V and Queen Mary.
This all seems very nice, especially for fans who have been starved for nearly four years. In the world of “Downton Abbey,” there is little that merits as much pomp and extravagance as visiting royalty, so the film seems to be the perfect way for fans to revisit the world they love so much. And yet, it is also worth considering how well this TV show translates to the big screen.
There are 52 episodes of “Downton Abbey.” Each episode runs slightly over 45 minutes, with the season finales running over 90 minutes. This means that the movie’s run-time is almost comparable to that of a typical season finale. The difference is that where the season finales represented the culmination of hours of character development, the movie does not. Add this to the fact that, by the series’ end, there was a main cast of about 20 characters; the result is… confusing.
How could the movie expect to accomplish the same level of plot development that the television series did, in a fraction of the time? A valiant effort was certainly made to give the beloved, but incredibly large, cast of characters each their moment to shine. But very few legitimately had any direct relevance to the plot. The cast rotates in and out of the audience’s periphery, in a sort of pre-WWII English pageant — save a few exceptions. These are Joseph Molesley (Kevin Doyle), the valet-turned-footman-turned-schoolteacher-turned-footman-again who serves as much of the film’s comedic relief and Thomas Barrow (Rob James-Collier), a formerly-villainous under-butler who receives a love interest and the dalliance he was denied during the series on account of being gay. Anyway, even events like attempted assassinations are glossed over quickly to move to the next item on the agenda.
There is also the addition of new characters, some of whom are given more time than members of the series cast. The audience is simply expected to the same level of emotion and connection at seeing these characters that they do for the main cast. Yet, they have only entered the world of “Downton Abbey” as a form of narrative contrivance, as part of this plot that exists independently of the rest of the world. They have not been a part of the lives of viewers for six years.
Of course, “Downton Abbey” is not the first television show to attempt this transition to the “big screen.” And, for better or for worse, it likely will not be the last. “The Addams Family” saw mild critical success but grossed over $191 million worldwide with a production budget of $30 million. The “Sex and the City” film opened to a more tepid reception, and still managed to be the most successful romantic comedy of 2008. Just one week after the Crawley’s estate made its comeback in American movie theaters, its revenue more than tripled its production budget.
The critical response also does not appear to be overly critical. And, in all honesty, as I left the movie theater after two hours surrounded by sheer opulence and high-society melodrama, I did feel a certain sense of contentment. Not because I felt I had gained a new perspective or some massive plot-hole had been filled in. Rather, it was the simple contentment that accompanies seeing old friends. It is the reason why TV shows trouble with the journey to movie theaters in the first place, or why Disney has decided to create live-action versions of animated classics: Hollywood knows that it can turn a profit from nostalgia.
Perhaps cinema as a whole is entering an era where nothing truly ends. I cannot say with certainty that there will be another “Downton Abbey” movie, but I would not be surprised if there were. So long as there is money to be made, there will be people making the movies. As someone who enjoys artistry in filmmaking, the thought of a franchise-driven movie culture is disappointing. But, as a Downton-phile, I would not mind a sequel.

Friday night at the Oberon began just as every good Friday night should — with one very hairy leg.
The hairiness of this leg wasn’t the only thing that set it apart. Peeking just barely behind the backstage curtain, it seemed hesitant to appear before such a large crowd. Slowly but surely, the leg began to peer further and further beyond the curtain, until it finally took the position one might expect from the world’s shyest Rockette. Appropriately, the crowd burst into applause at such a spectacle. As the yet-unseen performer gained more confidence, the leg was joined by an equally hairy arm, and eventually another leg.
Finally, the face of renowned drag queen Martha Graham Cracker made its grand appearance, sporting gorgeous makeup, a perfectly styled wig, and a terrified expression. As she emerged from behind the curtain and began to descend the stairs, her body trembled and hesitated with each step. She struggled to remember the words to her first song, and at one point froze with her foot suspended in mid-air. “It’s like getting into a really cold pool,” she mumbled under her breath. “Then just dive right in!” returned a member of the audience.
And dive in, she did. Within moments, Martha Graham Cracker was in full performance mode, thrusting and swaying to a fantastic rendition of Gypsy’s “Let Me Entertain You.” Shedding the “shy performer” character that she had so masterfully just played, Martha was able to fully showcase her talents in a surprisingly athletic act, climbing along high railings and onto tables full of beverages. Naturally, this was all accomplished while adorned in a sequined jumpsuit that Martha herself said “makes me look like I’m in a Ginger Rogers movie where I’m playing tennis but also trying to seduce my opponent.” And she really does capture this character quite well. The only difference between her and Ginger Rogers? Probably the fact that she is a 6’2” drag queen covered from head to toe in hair.
The Philadelphia-native and her four-piece band have spent several years perfecting the art of the drag cabaret. Described as “perhaps the world’s tallest and hairiest drag queen,” Martha Graham Cracker revels in subverting expectations. If there’s one thing Martha isn’t, it’s predictable. In line with that unpredictability, no two Martha Graham Cracker shows are the same. Each performance she gives — including the two at the Oberon — is a totally unique experience, complete with different jokes, different music, different costumes, and different personas.
The theme for this particular night was “How our current political climate is like my love life: A treatise by Martha Graham Cracker.” This premise gave Martha ample opportunity to combine political statements with sexual innuendo. “They say that this country is like a pendulum,” she said at one point, referencing the popular Ruth Bader Ginsburg quote. “But this is a lot of swinging we’re going through. And not even the good kind.”
In addition to giving fans incentive to attend multiple shows, the originality of each performance gives Martha the freedom to cater her shows to her audience. Jokes about the pretentiousness of “Canterbridgians” (including the term itself) were not off-limits for Martha’s visit to Cambridge, and it’s this level of personal connection between performer and audience that makes the towering star so appealing.
This flexibility also allows Martha to show off one of her many talents: improv. Whether it’s coming up with a song on the spot or flirting with audience members, Martha continuously proves that the best material is not the kind that’s written down and committed to memory, but the words that come out in the heat of the moment. The shared audience experience of knowing that you could be picked on and given a lap dance at any moment is equal parts scary and exhilarating, and that’s what the intimate nature of the cabaret setting is all about.
Martha Graham Cracker is just one of the diverse set of artists invited to the Oberon as part of their “AFTERGLOW” series. Put on as a partnership between the A.R.T. and Provincetown’s AFTERGLOW festival, the series focuses on carving out a space for artists that often go unappreciated, particularly in the face of gentrification. The festival’s founder, Quinn Cox, came on stage before Martha’s performance to highlight the importance of programs like this one. “Cambridge used to be a thriving performance arts scene,” he explained. “But now we have artists saying there’s no audience for them here… I think we’ve changed that narrative tonight, thank you very much.”
One glance at the audience before him lends support to this claim. The show attracted a crowd unlike those usually seen on Harvard’s campus, with people of all ages and backgrounds eager to bask in the exciting, yet too often marginalized, culture of drag cabaret. Clearly there is an audience for this type of art, and AFTERGLOW provides the space for these audiences and performers to come together. Though Martha’s reign over the Oberon has ended, the AFTERGLOW series will continue through 2020, with performances by artists like Amber Martin, Nath Ann Carrera, Kareem Lucas, and Penny Arcade. If Martha Graham Cracker’s memorable display of eccentricity and talent is any indication, these performances are certainly worth checking out.

Brass fanfare and a rolling timpani inaugurated the night for the opening to a three-part program at Symphony Hall on Oct. 5. At the center was the dazzling Yuja Wang, the Beijing native and world-renowned concert pianist who finished her third and final performance of Shostakovich’s first piano concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra this week.
The concert began with James Lee III’s modern symphonic poem “Sukkot Through Orion’s Nebula,” which was the perfect sonic primer to the rest of the evening’s musical delights. Full of color and suspense, the atmosphere quickly burgeoned into one of astral mystique and shifted playfully between the bright and victorious and the coy and melancholic. At the end of the piece, which received a generous standing ovation, Lee himself joined Andris Nelsons, BSO’s conductor, on the stage and took three sets of bows in front of the charmed audience.
Next in the program was Wang, the evening’s star. With an in-character bold-colored dress — sequined and bright magenta today — signature bob, and five-inch stilettos, she kept in her tradition of audaciously redefining the standard for how a classical musician can dress on stage. When she played, charisma and musicality radiated from her body, from slight facial gestures down to the almost-choreographed billow of her arms. The orchestra carried a look of respect and camaraderie while accompanying her on stage.
Wang led the way throughout the concerto, calling Nelsons and the orchestra to follow. Nelsons and orchestra adeptly adhered. Upon their solid foundation, Wang moved in perfect synchrony with the orchestra, swaying and breathing, and relished the concerto’s boldest moments with poised fluidity and effortlessness.
Wang’s rendition of the Shostakovich was full of poignant interpretations of phrasing, never overly ponderous but impeccably balanced and bursting with whimsical expressiveness. She preferred cleanness and delicacy in the quiet, lyrical moments and a firm, persevering insistence in the faster and more dramatic passages. Her facial expressions were also a delight to watch, with each new musical idea reflecting a change in her cognitive, emotional state. At times, her face carried a look of utmost seriousness, at others, a look of forlorn wretchedness, and at many times, a look of levity and joy.
Wang was truly the highlight of the night, and many in the audience had traveled far and paid a hefty sum to see her play. Truly, they had not come simply to hear the symphony, but to be inspired by Wang’s presence and unfaltering grace. On the stage, Yuja Wang was sublimely free. Years and years of practice, discipline, and talent were coming, once again, to fruition in the form of sharing a gift. The immensity of her drive and ambition are so clearly displayed in their entirety — and that is what is most special about her. Something about her strikes an arresting chord, a rare pinnacle: Here she was, a young female virtuoso pianist, internationally acclaimed, inspiring a full house of the Boston audience.
When the Shostakovich was finished, Wang took multiple bows during a seemingly-endless applause. She finished her evening with a single encore, the “Mélodie de Gluck” from the opera Orfeo ed Euridice. Many in the audience, including myself, could not hide our slight disappointment at such a brief encore, which was rare for the artist known to sometimes return with six or seven encores. Still, the solemn melody was delicate and beautiful.
The symphony concluded its program with selections from Smetana’s “Má Vlast.” The familiar, folksy, nostalgic tune of “Vltava,” the dramatic intensity of “From Bohemia’s Woods and Fields,” and the joyful singing of “Blanik” sealed the evening in a warm palette. It was a satisfying end to the cold October evening. The memories from the program lingered well into the night.

Should an art form, or a culture, be forever tied to its origins? Is some art meant only for specific populations? Is evolution progress or destruction? “The Purists,” written by Dan McCabe and directed by Tony Award-winner Billy Porter, asks all these questions in a play revolving around three old men and the apartment stoop they occupy for hours each day. “The Purists” is a gripping story of music, change, human connection, and much more, steeped in hip hop culture with several impressive rap performances.
“The Purists” revolves around its characters, and each one has depth and nuance. There are only five characters: Lamont Born Cipher (Morocco Omari), a former rap legend, self-described “alpha male” passionate about preserving hip hop, Mr. Bugz (J Bernard Calloway), a legendary DJ forced to come to terms with his sexuality, and Gerry (John Scurti), an elderly, bisexual, musical snob form a core trio, rounded out by two young female MCs, Val (Analisa Velez) and Nancy (Izzie Steele). Each and every character is flawed yet redeemable, broken yet loveable. They all fit together perfectly to complement one another in a story ultimately driven solely by their conversations (and rap battles).
Each character has their flaws. Gerry consistently makes racist statements (while complaining about PC culture) while Lamont expresses blatantly homophobic sentiments and behavior. Gerry detests everything that isn’t classic, Sondheim-esque musical theater, while Lamont lives for old-school hip hop. Meanwhile, Bugz serves as a liaison between the two as he finds his own views on music and sexuality shifting. There is nothing simple about their relationships with one another; often, they can’t stand one another, and yet they consider each other close friends. Better yet, the writing and convincing performances pull off this dynamic so that it doesn’t seem far-fetched, but beautifully genuine. At the core, the play is about the messy contradictions inherent in human relationships and finding connection despite the odds.
The two female characters, while they have fewer lines, are also well developed, with idealistic dreams that contrast with their older, jaded male counterparts. Val is a rambunctious Puerto Rican drug dealer who pours everything into her rap career, while Nancy is a bubbly white telemarketer running a one-woman hip hop musical about the life of Amelia Earhart. Despite being set up in stark contrast and pushed to competition and comparison with one another, they’re able to connect over their passion for rap, distaste for misogyny in hip hop, and deep drive. These five jagged pieces fit together perfectly as each one forces another to grow and confront their own misconceptions, and viewers find themselves invested in each of their journeys.
Music also plays a central role in the play in every way; it’s not just in the dialogue but it’s used as a form of expression and symbolism throughout. In the first scene, Gerry’s record of “The Sound of Music” is cut off by Lamont approaching the apartment blasting rap from his boombox. No conversation is complete without references to musical artists, while Val, Nancy, and Lamont each perform several raps built into the narrative. The play could perhaps be best appreciated by hip hop fans, but the compelling dialogue and lyrics leave plenty of access points for strangers to the genre with an open mind. The integration of the performances feels seamless and helps the play maintain a sense of momentum and energy in what is essentially two hours of dialogue in and in front of an apartment building. Yet music is also used to symbolize the apparently fundamental differences between characters, like Gerry and Lamont’s polar opposite tastes (yet strikingly similar views on purism), and critiques of the contemporary rap scene bring challenging questions about racism, class, and masculinity.
In fact, what may be the play’s primary shortcoming is that it raises more questions than it can answer. Or, perhaps it sees those questions as too personal and nuanced to fully answer. As a result, the show ends at what feels like a climax, rather than a resolution. Relationships are tested and strengthened, and long-held views are challenged, but it’s unclear whether any of the characters really come out on the other end with growth. Some characters criticize misogyny in rap, while others insist it’s merely a result of powerful figures in the industry without coming to any consensus. If Gerry can come to admire Nancy’s efforts to create something new in the theater space, but he and Lamont still express unrelenting distaste for art that defies tradition, what is the piece trying to say about purism? The play doesn’t seem to provide an answer. Certainly the audience is challenged to grapple with these questions for themselves, but they’re also left craving a deeper sense of resolution. Yet even that goes back to the careful development of each character, so their stubbornness feels authentic instead of just frustrating, and their conflicts are heartbreaking rather than perplexing. As much as viewers will walk away with big questions, the character and relationships in “The Purists” they won’t be able to get out of their heads.

When you think of political satire in the age of Trump, it’s hard not to think of Saturday Night Live. Sure, there may be louder, bloodier, or crazier parodies of the failings of the Trump administration. But few have as wide a reach, as broad a viewership, or as much cultural clout as SNL.
Following in that legacy, this past weekend’s impeachment was SNL at its most “satirical” — or, at least, its most critical of this administration. Alec Baldwin leaned all the way into his caricature; his duck-lipped, North Korea-obsessed, Liam Neeson-loving Trump was truly in rare form. After telling Bowen Yang’s Kim Jong-Un, “I wish my country was as cool as your country,” and asking “Big Mike” Pence, “How’s church going?”, he finishes the sketch by calling a hitman to “take out” the Ukraine whistleblower.
SNL has often been lauded for pissing off the President and exemplifying the kind of “resistance” in the media he loves ranting against. Their early portrayals of Trump and his supporters (ordinary, truck-driving, laundry washing Americans who turned out to all be Nazis, white supremacists, and KKK members) certainly earned them some angry Trump tweets.
But do SNL’s political skits deserve the moral high ground they’re often given by viewers and critics just because they make Trump angry? Are they really a part of that loosely-defined “resistance” they seem to espouse?
I’d argue they mostly just make things worse.
At a time when our country is more divided than ever, SNL’s political sketches present a version of the world that is more in line with Donald Trump’s than almost everything else on television. It’s a version where rich, liberal New Yorkers laugh at truck drivers and blue-collar painters and laundresses and see the idea of supporting Trump as utterly ridiculous. The version where one side of the country sits in a room and mocks a “culture” they view as foreign and inferior to them — a culture that, most of the time, they don’t even try to understand.
I’m not here to say SNL political skits are “bad,” per se (I love Kate McKinnon as much as the next girl), and I’m definitely not here to excuse Donald Trump’s racist, dangerous, and impeachable behavior. Political satire has been around forever, and it’s an inevitable part of the way our democracy responds to presidents, especially those who don’t have the majority of the country’s support.
But there’s something particularly off-putting about the way that SNL characterizes Donald Trump’s presidency. They don’t just laugh at his odd physical characteristics (like their version of Hillary with a strained, mechanical voice) or his policy decisions. They have, in many ways, defined themselves by Baldwin’s now-ubiquitous depiction of the President, and by videos lumping his supporters together into one group of crazy idiots. They’ve won awards (Baldwin’s Emmy-winning performance was lauded as the “Most Important TV Performance of 2017”), giving speeches about the “important work” they were doing. Dozens of media outlets have praised them for being “brave and necessary television.” There’s something odd about the way they seem to assume their polarizing caricature has some kind of special moral value.
No one ever changed their minds because they got called a Nazi. I’d go even further to say that all buffoonish caricatures and wild exaggerations do is further entrench the polarization that got us in this mess in the first place.
Perhaps there’s a place for making fun of Donald Trump. But to give so much cultural weight and airtime to a show that’s singularly preoccupied with caricaturing him and his supporters seems at best oblivious. At worst, it’s blatantly ignorant of the stakes of winning over “his supporters” (who are, as a matter of fact, not a monolith and not all Nazis) — which is the only way under our current system to actually change anything. I think we can all agree that you're going to change exactly zero minds when you start off with the “joke” that all Trump voters are KKK members.
At the end of the day, when I sit down and pull up an SNL cold open video, I’m sitting down next to people who look like me and laughing at an exaggerated straw man of others I don’t agree with. And let’s be real, that’s exactly the kind of America Trump wants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On October 29, 2018, I skipped class. I hopped into an Uber and headed towards South Boston to attend the trial for Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, an event that would determine the future of affirmative action policy. This was the day that eight current and former students of Harvard College bravely testified to the contributions of race-conscious admissions to the Harvard experience, a rare day when many Harvard students chose to forsake academic responsibilities to witness a piece of history and show their support for their peers on the frontlines. Clumps of bright blue shirts with bold lettering proclaiming “Defend Diversity” dotted the audience, otherwise a sea of black and gray blazers.
Almost a year later, the court has ruled in favor of Harvard’s affirmative action policies. This victory, however short-lived it might be, should be celebrated. Without an attention to race, admissions policies would neglect the social and cultural contexts that have underwritten the experiences of many students of color. While the era of slavery or the struggle for civil rights may appear to be relics of the past, their narratives and truths continue to determine everything from our subconscious biases to the distribution of wealth.
Harvard, however, must take a step further. This victory is an opportunity for the College to grapple with how it treats students of color after they arrive on campus. If it is willing to fight for a diverse student body and the richness accompanying that diversity, it must also be willing to support them past the point of admission.
W.E.B. DuBois, Class of 1890, once reflected that while at Harvard, he felt that he was “in Harvard, but not of it.” While students of color are now allowed to live in Harvard’s dorms (DuBois was not), they are often forced to exist within that same tension, grappling with an institution originally constructed to exclude those who were non-white. Harvard has certainly come a long way in the past century; however, the vestiges of those exclusionary policies live on, both through explicit neglect and implicit culture, and must be challenged rigorously.
Explicit neglect includes the absence of institutional measures that students of color have demanded for decades, such as the creation of a robust and critical academic program for ethnic studies. For over four decades, student-activists and alumni have championed this effort, one that is only now gaining the traction it has deserved for so long. In a similar vein, the silence surrounding the creation of a multicultural center (that multiple peer institutions, such as Yale and Princeton, have had for years) speaks volumes. Cultural affinity groups on campus have thrived not because of, but despite, the University.
Implicit culture reveals itself in various ways. These are the cultural standards that allow University President Lawrence S. Bacow to construct an insensitive analogy to explain that just as people cannot own slaves, Harvard cannot “own” their alumni. These standards give rise to a racially-motivated threat scribbled onto a sticky note, plastered to a professor’s door. Harvard as a whole cannot be blamed for either of these events — Bacow’s inappropriate comment was an individual choice, one for which he has received considerable backlash; and the University has mobilized quickly to unequivocally support the professor threatened with a hate crime. However, that these events have occurred only in the past couple of weeks is indicative of a broader culture here that places people of color on the fringes of the University.
This implicit culture also places a heavy burden on faculty of color, many of whom take on the invisible responsibility of helping students of color navigate the University; but this is a form of labor neither properly rewarded nor incentivized by the institution. This burden trickles into the work that cultural groups must do to support students of color. While they create peer-to-peer resource guides and informal mentorship networks out of concern and care for their communities, the burden of adequately supporting students should have been shouldered by Harvard long ago.
I don’t expect for Harvard to get everything right on the first try, nor am I naive enough to believe that it can fix these problems in an instant. But it’s been much longer than that — there are concrete things that Harvard can do (and should’ve done years ago) to help students feel like they belong on campus. The University should aspire towards creating a multicultural center, or at least some sort of physical space for belonging and inclusion — one that is not in the basement of a freshman dorm, or a pre-existing academic building. Harvard should find ways to concretely reward faculty of color for their contributions to the undergraduate community. Racial literacy trainings for students, faculty, and administrators could be a significant first step in cultivating a community that is cognizant of the role race plays at Harvard.
Harvard has chosen to fight for diversity, to invest in it. It has made this claim to the world through defending its admissions policies in court. But is Harvard willing to prove that students of color truly matter, outside of brochures and palatable statistics? Will it continue to allow us to exist on the fringes, or is it willing to bring us into the center — to make us feel as if we are not just in Harvard, but of Harvard?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stop a random Harvard student on the street and ask them how their week is going. Then ask another one. And another.
These fleeting interpersonal exchanges that we have every day, with a guy from section, a dining hall crush, or a friend of a friend are so ubiquitous and so unremarkable that the actual words we say to each other as we pass in the street fade into oblivion before we’ve even finished saying them. This currency of social graces only matters because it gives us a sense of our place in a larger community.
But have you ever stopped to listen to what we say? Ask a Harvard student how their week is going as you pass them on the street, and, most likely, they will tell you that they’ve just been working or that they’re stressed. And the two aren’t unrelated. As much as these countless interactions grease the wheels of our social existence, if we ever paused to reflect on them we’d realize the thing that brings us together most easily in conversation — the thing we talk about as we pass in the street — is that we’re constantly stressed, and that it makes us miserable.
Harvard proudly proclaims that its mission is “to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” But all is not well in the kingdom of Cambridge. Harvard’s suicide rate remains tragically, unspeakably high, and the Office of the Provost convened a task force to address the state of mental health treatment on campus in response to the existing facilities’ inability to meet student demand for counseling despite a hiring effort which brought the total staff to 50 mental health professionals. Students who cannot summon the strength to get out of bed in the morning cannot be expected to be members of an engaged citizenry, much less citizen leadership.
Harvard can and should take drastic action to improve the quality of its mental health services. But the work of making our campus — and others like it across the country — safe again does not stop there. A growing body of academic literature is questioning whether our education and the cultural institutions associated with elite schooling more broadly have a role to play in this mental carnage. William Deresiewicz’s “Excellent Sheep” details the commodification of education, the rise of pushy parenting, insider admissions, and the ways the system produces, well, excellent sheep.
Daniel Markovits’ “The Meritocracy Trap” takes the analysis a step further. For all walks of life, he argues, the meritocratic ideal has forced us to run as fast as we can just to stay in place. But as students, we knew that already. The pressures we grew up with, the social mores of our lives, and the expectation of our participation in elite cultural life well after we depart Harvard mean that we simply cannot get off the treadmill. And the yawning chasm of economic inequality, growing wider year after year, only makes the fall that much more scary.
Let's be clear: It's not the idea of meritocracy that is the problem, but how that idea has been translated into practice. A system in which professional success is predicated on any criteria other than ability to do the job well is antithetical to all our values. But our own system has been constructed to allow a dehumanizing race to the bottom to see who is willing to sacrifice the most from their lives to win the rat race. The rise of entire industries, like banking, predicated on the willingness of young people to work grotesquely long working weeks in pursuit of career advancement, should only serve to underscore the implacable grip this work-mania has won over us.
Boo-hoo, you cry. Poor elites need to slave away to earn their second homes. How unfair.
But this culture isn’t just bad for the rich. The very pressures that drive us to work those extra hours make the American Dream less accessible for everyone else. A low-income student doesn’t have time to put in the extra work to really nail their paper because they have to work part-time just to stay in school. A single parent working two or three jobs just to make ends meet can’t be home to read to their children, help them with schoolwork, or try to instill the learning habits they hope will lead them to a better future.
We cannot have a solution just for rich people, or simply focus on expanding the number of jobs available for everyone else without deep reflection on what working entails.
In fact, the two problems must be examined together to find a solution that works for everyone. Viewed in this light, policy initiatives meant to reduce economic inequality and assure broad-based economic security need not be seen as class warfare by the top 1 percent at all. Addressing the insane skew at the top of the income distribution and building a new model of prosperity anchored in inclusive growth will not only revitalize the declining middle class, but will also help the top 1 percent retreat from the dangerous, self-destructive status competition — often measured in working hours — that has become par for the course when it comes to life in the fast lane.
Once we accept that expecting people to work 80 or 100 hours a week is dehumanizing, the idea that, like in France, we should not expect each other to be accountable by email 24/7 goes hand in hand with the idea that nobody should work a 40 hour week and still be below the poverty line. While these circumstances are wildly different, they hint at a common principle: the idea that the absence of human connection, the inability to find time for leisure due to (real or perceived) economic necessity, and a lack of personal fulfillment outside participation in the labor market impoverishes all our lives. That principle is basic and universal, and if we want to be bound together by more than our common misery, we must live up to it, together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, Harvard Law School announced plans to expand public university representation in its Junior Deferral Program. This decision comes as part of a larger move on the part of the Law School to make its application process more accessible, including the expansion of the Junior Deferral Program beyond Harvard College and acceptance of the GRE in place of the LSAT.
We have commended the Junior Deferral Program in the past, which allows students to gain real-world experience by deferring their admission to law school for at least two years. Two admissions cycles ago, the program was opened to non-Harvard students, allowing for representation from other universities.
The increased marketing to public university students would be a crucial step to increasing diversity at the Law School, as only seven of the 42 colleges represented in the program are public. By visiting schools in regions that have been historically underrepresented and accepting more of their students, the Law School is benefiting future classes by developing its geographic and institutional diversity.
While this effort is crucial to the success and lasting significance of JDP, the program assumes a certain amount of privilege from its potential applicants. Preparing to take the LSAT early, gaining beneficial experiences and coursework, and being able to commit to law school by junior year of college are all obstacles that would tend to skew JDP applicant pool toward the more privileged.
Just as early admissions in the college application process disproportionately help the privileged and wealthy, we are worried that JDP will have a similar effect. Now that the program admits students irrespective of undergraduate institution, it is critical for the Law School to commit fully and comprehensively to supporting less privileged students, especially those from diverse backgrounds, in the early admissions process. It would be very troubling if the program became yet another potential channel by which students from privileged backgrounds are privileged in the admissions process.
Despite these reservations, we stand by our opinion that JDP is important not least because it encourages students who are most interested in pursuing law to gain a diverse set of experiences outside their academics without the burdens of a postgraduate application. Yet we puzzle over the exact nature of the programs intentions and how those intentions have changed over time with the expansion of the program. We hope that, in clarifying those intentions, the Law School forefronts diversity — of background, as well as intellectual strengths and life experiences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 9, 2019, at 1:07 a.m.
Harvard’s graduate student union will hold a strike authorization vote, the group announced in an email to members Tuesday morning.
This step moves the union — Harvard Graduate Students-United Automobile Workers — one step closer to a strike, which could only follow an authorization vote backed by two-thirds of its voting members. The vote will begin Oct. 15, exactly one year after the contract negotiations with the University began, according to the email from the union’s bargaining committee.
HGSU bargaining committee member Cory W. McCartan wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s “intransigence” on harassment and discrimination protections led to the decision to call for a strike vote.
“Student workers demand fair compensation, improvements on our healthcare plans, and commonsense protections from harassment and discrimination, and we will go all the way to win a fair contract,” McCartan wrote.
HGSU organizers have voiced growing frustration in recent months over the state of contract negotiations, which began nearly a year ago. The union and the University have reached eight tentative agreements, but remain at odds on issues like the sexual harassment and nondiscrimination proposal and the economic proposals.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday morning that University administrators believe the union's calls for a strike authorization vote are "unwarranted."
“The University believes that calls for a strike are unwarranted,” he wrote. “The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith and has offered substantive proposals that address the concerns raised by HGSU-UAW throughout these negotiations.”
This month’s strike authorization vote will require approval by two-thirds of those voting to pass, according to the rules set out in the United Automobile Workers constitution. HGSU’s bargaining unit comprises roughly 5,000 members, including undergraduate and graduate teaching fellows, teaching assistants, course assistants, and graduate research assistants.
Ratification of the strike authorization would not immediately trigger a strike, but rather would permit the bargaining committee to call for a strike when it sees fit.
HGSU first threatened to organize for a strike authorization vote in an open letter addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in July. Organizers delivered that letter — which was signed by more than 300 union members — to the University during a July 15 bargaining session.
The bargaining committee wrote in its Tuesday email to members that the University has “refused to budge” since the union delivered their ultimatum in July.
“We have waited long enough,” the email reads. “That is why the union bargaining committee is asking members to authorize a strike if necessary.”
Times and locations for the vote will be announced Friday, and there will be options for absentee voting, according to the union’s email. All student workers who have signed a union card will be eligible to vote, and union cards will be available to sign at the polls, the email said.
HGSU declined to comment on when the vote is expected to close.
Former National Labor Relations Board Chairman William B. Gould IV said in an interview Tuesday that the strike authorization vote announcement raises the negotiations “another notch in terms of pressure,” but does not necessarily mean a strike is imminent.
“What the union will do when they get a vote, if they get an affirmative vote, is, of course, use it as a means of pressure,” Gould said. “It's hard to know whether a strike is likely to follow or not.”
Thus far, the University and union have tentatively agreed to contract provisions on severability, union recognition, accessibility to employment records, and resources for professional development. In August, the two sides reached three additional agreements on intellectual property, health and safety, and the formation of a union-management committee. On Sept. 9, they agreed on a provision for travel reimbursements.
Provisions on sexual harassment and nondiscrimination, wages, and medical benefits, however, remain unresolved after 23 bargaining sessions. The next bargaining session will be held Oct. 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston — which officially opens in June 2020 — will house several collaborative spaces designed to bring together students across the University, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said in an interview Monday.
Doyle said he hopes these spaces will provide opportunities for “serendipitous collisions” between students and faculty members that will facilitate the exchange of ideas. To this end, the building will be designed around having common areas with ample furniture, rather than “linear corridors and doors off the corridor,” according to Doyle.
The building is designed around a central atrium that extends from two stories below ground to six stories above ground. SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff said the building’s architect called it a “vertical Harvard Yard,” where different students could mingle.
“You might be on the eighth floor and be able to see what’s going on the sixth floor... so everything becomes more cohesive in that regard,” Doyle said. “That’s probably one of the most impressive architectural features in the building.”
One of the building’s main features is a “maker space” located on the ground floor, which will contain facilities for 3-D printing and other tasks. This space will be surrounded by supplemental labs for the active learning components of various courses, such as those in Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering.
Doyle said supporting SEAS’s teaching mission is his “day one” priority. He added, however, that he hopes to eventually open up the “maker space” to other members of the Harvard community for their individual projects.
“We want to have students who are not necessarily engineers, students who are not necessarily in Cambridge or the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences] — they might come from some of the other schools — being able to access this,” he said.
As it stands, courses and activities at SEAS will utilize about half of the capacity of the building, Doyle said. He said he hopes to work with College and University administrators to ensure the remaining space is optimally allocated to courses outside of SEAS.
Several areas in the building were specifically designed with the needs of undergraduate and graduate students in mind, Doyle said. Graduate students will have their own dedicated lounge, while undergraduate student organizations will have their own offices and a shared garage.
Doyle said this will resolve existing space constraints for storing larger projects and will serve as a way for groups to host meetings and events.
“Today, if one of the student clubs wants space to do something, we are shoehorning them into the corner of somebody’s lab or a space in the back of a classroom or wherever we can find space,” Doyle said.
In the new building, however, student groups will have a “real operational space that is assigned to them.”
Doyle said he hopes common spaces and the capacity of the building expand beyond SEAS and incorporate all of FAS, describing it as a “blended solution for everybody.”
“This isn't just some engineering outpost — this really is a part of the expanded Harvard fabric,” Doyle said. “When you expand fabric, you stretch and strain sometimes, but let’s make it integrated.”

Harvard’s Title IX Office debuted an anonymous online reporting form on Monday designed to help students report sexual misconduct with greater comfort and logistical ease.
The tool is HarvardKey-protected, but its responses are moderated by an external company, according to University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill.
Merhill said that no one in the Title IX Office will be able to connect reports back to individuals. Instead, once a Harvard affiliate fills out the form, they receive a unique login credential that allows them to communicate with Harvard’s central Title IX Office anonymously.
The form’s questions are primarily opt-in, so that those who have experienced or witnessed a Title IX violation can reveal as much or as little information as they choose. Title IX is a federal anti-discrimination law designed to combat unfair treatment on the basis of gender that underpins Harvard’s anti-sexual misconduct policy. The questions on the form ask about the nature of the event, the people involved, the event’s location, and the reporter’s desired response from the Title IX Office.
Ensuring anonymity was central to the form’s development, according to Merhill. The Title IX Office sought out feedback on the reporting mechanism from students. Merhill said the office heard that students wanted to be certain their complaints would be anonymous and feel as though that anonymity was a priority to the Office.
“When they saw the original iteration of the form, they said, ‘Okay, if this is anonymous, why are you asking for names, email, and such?’ That was off-putting,” Merhill said. “So the very first question is, ‘Do you wish to remain anonymous?’ And if you say ‘Yes,’ that all disappears.”
Merhill also said that the Title IX Office’s rules and best practices will not change with the new reporting form. The anonymous reports will be kept apart from the Office of Dispute Resolution, which handles Title IX investigations. Filling out an anonymous report will not automatically trigger a formal ODR complaint.
Merhill said she hopes the tool will supplement existing channels of communication with the Title IX Office.
“Our hope is that those persons who feel comfortable and confident reaching out to our system of Title IX coordinators will continue to do so,” Merhill said. “Our goal is to capture the population of individuals who don't yet feel comfortable and confident reaching out to Title IX.”
Advocates of anonymous reporting — including the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which spearheaded a sexual misconduct climate collaborative in which Harvard is involved — say that anonymity helps support victims.
The anonymous disclosure system’s rollout follows the Government Department Committee on Climate Change’s recommendation that Harvard institute an anonymous reporting system in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez. The report indicates that the committee was interested in instituting its own anonymous reporting system, but was asked not to because the University was planning to roll out its own.

Harvard Law School Student Government Co-Presidents Princess Daisy M. A. Akita ’15 and Daniel M. Egel-Weiss are working with University officials to change the Law School’s current course evaluation to make it more similar to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Q Guide.
The Law School’s current evaluation system is heavily quantitative and exclusively asks students questions that they can answer on ranking scales. Akita and Engel-Weiss said they are hoping to redesign the evaluations to better meet the needs of law students.
“We have very few helpful questions,” Akita said. “We have a question like ‘How many hours do you spend on the class?’ But obviously, it’s always a wide range.”
FAS’s Q Guide, however, asks students to answer qualitative questions and provide open-ended feedback to their course heads. Students are asked to share the number of hours spent on the class and the amount of money spent on course materials. They also have the ability to rank their professor’s timeliness in handing back assignments and to rank their section.
At the end of the FAS Q Guide evaluation, students can write a paragraph about what they wish to tell future students about the class. The information is then posted to a website that is accessible alongside course listings.
Akita and Egel-Weiss said they are most interested in changing the Law School’s system to include a qualitative option for students to write a paragraph describing their experiences in a course. They said they want to provide an option for students to be able to share their experiences with individual professors’ styles of class participation.
“It’s very frustrating not to be able to have a qualitative list of reasons — why to take the course, why not to take the course,” Egel-Weiss said.
Akita and Egel-Weiss said they hope to have the change in place before they graduate.
“This is a fight we’re going to keep pushing on,” Akita said. “My personal timeline for getting this done is to at least get it up before we are no longer here. So that’s like a ticking time bomb of May 2020.”

Five new counselors joined the University’s Counseling and Mental Health Services this semester, bringing the total number of new counselors this year to eight.
The latest additions follow a smaller wave of hirings from last semester, when CAMHS hired three new counselors. The new counselors this year come from a variety of backgrounds and have specialties that range from cognitive behavioral therapy to biofeedback. Several of the new counselors specialize in treatment for students from underrepresented backgrounds.
These hirings come after students lobbied for more counselors of color and providers from more socioeconomically diverse backgrounds. Last year, Chief of CAMHS Barbara Lewis said that counselor hiring depends on the agency’s budget.
The counselors starting this fall include three licensed independent clinical social workers — Nick Esposito, Mojgan Ghasemian, Nicolas McQueen — and two clinical psychology interns — Catherine Teotico and Grace Waite.
Four of the eight new counselors list BGLTQ as among their “interests and expertise” in their biographies. One of the counselors wrote that she is a first-generation college student, and two wrote that they are immigrants. One of the new interns, Teotico, will help run a support group specifically for Asian international students.
CAMHS has previously come under fire for the demographics of its counseling staff, which some students say is not sufficiently diverse. Some students have said they would feel more comfortable being treated by counselors who share the same background as they do.
Harvard University Health Services has started several initiatives in recent years to address student concerns. HUHS helped create Indigo, a peer counseling group focused on issues of diversity, in 2016. Lewis and Barreira have said in previous interviews that HUHS is trying to hire more counselors with different backgrounds.
In April 2018, 13 of the 39 CAMHS staff members come from “various ethnic backgrounds,” according to an interview with Lewis at the time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview on Monday that he is confident an appeals court will uphold a federal judge’s recent ruling that Harvard does not discriminate against Asian American applicants in its College admissions policies.
When it comes to Harvard’s chances at the Supreme Court, however, Bacow was less certain about the University’s prospects.
“I thought that we would win in the First Circuit Court of Appeals because the First Circuit is obliged to apply the law as it exists, and we're not violating the law,” Bacow said. “And then the case will go to the Supreme Court; we'll see what happens there.”
Bacow’s comments come nearly a week after federal judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled in favor of Harvard in a lawsuit brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, who alleged that the College’s race-conscious admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants by holding them to higher standards.
In her decision, Burroughs wrote that she did not find any evidence of intentional discrimination and that a race-conscious policy was necessary to ensure that the College admits a diverse student body. SFFA had previously alleged that Harvard did not adequately explore other race-neutral admissions policies.
Three days after Burroughs ruled in favor of Harvard, SFFA filed a notice of appeal to the United States First Circuit Court of Appeals. Bacow said this move on their part was “not surprising.”
Far from its conclusion, experts believe the high-profile case is expected to drag on for several more years, and some say it may go to the Supreme Court. The Court's decision could then decide the fate of affirmative action at universities and colleges across the nation.
If the case is appealed to the Supreme Court and the justices decide to hear it, Harvard’s chances remain uncertain in the face of recent Trump administration appointees, including Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Bacow’s confidence in Harvard’s appellate position has long been apparent. In a September 2018 interview with The Crimson, Bacow — early in his tenure as University president — affirmed that he was “confident” that Harvard would win their case in the District Court.
In her decision last week, Burroughs wrote that Harvard’s admissions process was “imperfect” and suggested a number of changes, including instituting implicit bias training for admissions officers, establishing clear guidelines on the use of race, and monitoring any race-related statistical disparities.
Bacow said Monday the University will work to “do better” in their admissions process following the decision.
“The judge pointed out that our admissions process is not perfect, and I don't know any process that's perfect,” Bacow said. “We will try and learn from the case and do better in the future.”

Chen Jian, a history professor at Cornell University, discussed his upcoming biography of Zhou Enlai — the first Premier of the People's Republic of China — examining Zhou's role in Chinese political history, during a talk at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Monday evening.
The event, entitled “A Flawed Giant: Zhou Enlai’s and China’s Prolonged Rise,” featured Chen alongside Frederik Logevall, a History and Harvard Kennedy School professor.
Logevall introduced Chen as one of his “dear colleagues,” citing their 25-year-long friendship. Chen began the talk describing how his view of Zhou put forward in his book differs from other historians'.
“Intentionally or not, Zhou put democracy, freedom, and a full development of individuality ahead of those collective values [held by former Chairman of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong]. While some call Zhou a Mao-enabler, I say that he was also a Mao-controller,” Chen said. “Only by becoming a Mao-enabler would he be able to be a Mao-controller.”
“In the age of [President Donald] Trump and [Chinese President Xi] Jinping, I wish we could have a Zhou,” he added.
Extrapolating from his discourse on Mao and Zhou, Chen questioned the state of Chinese-style communism in the modern world.
“International communism as a 20th century phenomenon is dead,” Chen said. “People talk about the United States being a part of global capitalism. I would say that China is another part of global capitalism.”
Andrew W. Shen ‘23 said he enjoyed the event, particularly because of his personal interest in Zhou.
“I spent half my life in China, half my life in the States, and I’m really interested in Chinese history,” Shen said. “It was a really great opportunity to come out and hear about Zhou Enlai, who is someone who I personally admire.”
Jason M. Kelly, an assistant professor at the U.S. Naval War College who had Chen as a dissertation advisor, said he hoped Chen’s biography would use new archival evidence to reshape the debate over Zhou’s relationship with Mao.
“There is a need for a biography on Zhou Enlai to offer a real, fresh reassessment based on the material available,” Kelly said after the talk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate BGLTQ Business Society canceled a sponsorship with software firm Palantir Technologies last week after facing student backlash over the company’s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
HUBBS publicized the sponsorship with Palantir — which included an ethical decision-making exercise slated for Oct. 10 — over their email list Oct. 3. The next day, the organization announced they had canceled the event.
Palantir has faced criticism from both immigration advocacy groups and its own employees for its work with ICE in recent months. The firm supplies ICE with an intelligence-gathering system that critics allege enable agents to deport increased numbers of undocumented immigrants.
Hours after its initial email, HUBBS sent a follow-up message stating that several students had voiced concerns. At first, the organization announced it would donate any funds gained through the partnership to an immigration-related charity.
That evening and the next day, students criticized HUBBS over the Queer Students and Allies organization email list. The HUBBS board then responded over the QSA list saying they had changed their minds and decided to cancel the partnership entirely.
“When a member brought up Palantir’s relationship with ICE, we had initially thought we could allow them to come to campus and then donate the proceeds to an undocumented charity, but we recognize now that bringing Palantir to campus is harmful no matter where proceeds go and that it is unfair to students and antithetical to the diverse communities at Harvard,” they wrote over the email list.
“It was a mistake from the beginning and honestly board was deeply divided about whether to proceed with this sponsorship altogether even as of last night,” they added.
HUBBS’s board wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that they regret the partnership with Palantir.
“We actually cancelled the event, and HUBBS will no longer be hosting it or working with Palantir as a sponsor until their work with ICE changes. We sincerely apologize to anyone who was hurt by the prospect of this event, and we hope our actions remedied the situation,” the statement reads.
The board issued the statement from an organizational email account and did not attribute the statement to any HUBBS members after multiple requests. Michael Montella ’21 and Catherine J. “Cate” Pinto ’20 are the co-presidents of HUBBS, according to the organization’s website.
Brooke J. Martin ’21, who sent an email over the QSA list calling on HUBBS to explain its relationship with Palantir, said she wanted to pressure the organization by bringing more attention to the sponsorship.
“I wanted to put pressure on HUBBS, quite frankly,” Martin said. “The goal there was to force HUBBS’s hand, and I think it did.”
Spokespeople for Palantir and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment Monday afternoon.
QSA co-Chair Angela E. Kim ’21 wrote in an email that the organization supports HUBBS’s decision to cancel the event.
“QSA is proud to stand with undocumented immigrants,” Kim wrote. “We appreciate that HUBBS listened to community feedback and decided not to partner with Palantir for this event. In light of this, we encourage students and organizations to be actively aware of the companies they choose to work with and support.”
College students across the country have taken issue with Palantir’s undergraduate outreach efforts in recent months. Palantir tried to host a similar “ethics tabletop exercise” at Duke last month, where it was met with student protests.
A petition calling on students to refuse job offers from Palantir has garnered more than 2,000 signatures from students attending schools including Harvard, Stanford, and Yale.

Harvard Medical School professor William G. Kaelin won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his research discoveries on how cells use oxygen.
The prize was jointly awarded to Kaelin alongside Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe, a professor of medicine at Oxford University, and Gregg L. Semenza, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
The prize honored the professors’ research on “how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability,” according to press release from the The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet.
“Thanks to the groundbreaking work of these Nobel Laureates, we know much more about how different oxygen levels regulate fundamental physiological processes,” the press release reads. “Oxygen sensing allows cells to adapt their metabolism to low oxygen levels: for example, in our muscles during intense exercise.”
Kaelin described receiving the prize as “thrilling” in an interview Monday.
“It’s of course thrilling when your colleagues, especially colleagues you admire, think that your work is worthy of any major scientific prize, let alone a Nobel Prize,” Kaelin said. “Obviously I’m on cloud nine that my colleagues around the world apparently thought this was a discovery that was Nobel Prize worthy, and I am thrilled to share it with my colleagues.”
Kaelin — who said that he was rejected from Harvard College, the Medical School, and a residency program before being hired by the Medical School — said that he heard about the news from a phone call from Stockholm at 4:40 a.m. Monday.
“I learned the news in the classical style, which is a very early phone call,” he said.
Kaelin said that while the prize was an honor, participating in the research itself was “the real prize.”
“On one level, the prize is participating in the discovery, being the first person to understand something that has never been truly understood before, seeing a mechanism that on occasion is actually beautiful or elegant. That’s the real prize in science,” Kaelin said.
Kaelin is the most recent Harvard faculty member to receive the award since Economics professor Oliver Hart won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2016. Kaelin is the 17th Harvard faculty member to win the prize in physiology or medicine.

The Harvard Physics department, in collaboration with the Women+ of Color Project, hosted a Graduate School 101 Workshop Weekend from Friday to Sunday for women who come from backgrounds underrepresented in physics.
The conference — which drew 150 applicants — presented 20 invitees with the opportunity to receive feedback on their graduate school applications and network with Harvard Physics faculty.
The conference was the brainchild of Physics graduate student LaNell A. Williams, who founded the WOCP in July to increase representation of black, indigenous, and Latinx women in STEM graduate programs.
“The WOCP hopes to address this issue by providing an open platform for WOC to communicate about best practices for applying to graduate [school], surviving graduate school, maintaining research productivity, and growing your academic careers,” Williams wrote in an email.
Williams said that she conceived of the three-day conference as an in-person extension of the WOCP’s mission.
“We want [participants] to see that we exist here, we all applied here, and a lot of us got in here, and we are here to support them and encourage them to also apply so we can improve the numbers,” she said.
“I don't think I've ever met a woman of color, especially one at an Ivy, that hasn’t been told — despite them being excellent on paper — that for some reason, they're not good enough to apply to places like Harvard, because there's always this imaginary white man and/or Asian man who is going to be most likely more qualified than you,” she added.
Williams said Physics department faculty have supported her in planning the conference. Physics professor Jenny Hoffman helped secure conference funding from the Heising-Simons Foundation, which covered travel, lodging, and meals for participants, according to Williams.
Participants said that they found the conference “uplifting” and “empowering.”
Attendee Bria Collier, a physics graduate student in the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master’s-to-Ph.D. Bridge Program, said the conference dispelled the idea that “you have to be perfect on paper.”
“LaNell and the other volunteers explained to us ways we can highlight our accomplishments and move around little insecurities we have,” she said.
Attendee Elizabeth Gutierrez — an undergraduate at the University of Texas, Austin studying physics and astronomy — said that her status as a first-generation college student made graduate school admissions daunting.
“No one in my family has a Ph.D. and I don't really know what the process is like,” she said. “But we had a panel: ‘What do graduate schools look for?’”
“What I really liked about the conference was that all the participants there share the same experiences that I had,” she added. “We actually started a GroupMe, or a group chat, to keep in contact with each other.”
Williams said she is currently collaborating with other women of color who have created resources for prospective graduate students. She said she is specifically working with John Hopkins graduate student Lavontria M. Aaron, who created a resource database for people of color, and Emory University graduate student Ayanna Jones, who founded STEM in Color.
Attendee Ashley Walker, an undergraduate at Chicago State University studying astro-chemistry, said she is grateful for the personal connections she built during the conference.
“In the words of LaNell, we aren’t each other's competitors. We are each other's future collaborators,” Walker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is no doubt that any Harvard-Yale matchup has a little extra buzz to it, but when both teams have identical records and are vying for a top spot in the conference, it is safe to say that there was a lot more surrounding this game than just the historical rivalry.
On a chilly Saturday night, Harvard’s women’s soccer team (8-2, 2-0 Ivy League) took to the pitch under the lights to battle a Yale squad (7-3, 1-1 Ivy League) that looked to defend its home turf in a pivotal mid-season game. The contest would prove to be incredibly hard-fought, as neither team would budge an inch. Yet, the difference-maker proved to be a 65th-minute goal from first-year forward Gabby DelPico, as the match concluded in a 1-0 victory for the Crimson, leaving it in sole possession of second place in the Ivy League, right behind Brown (8-1-1, 2-0 Ivy League).
Senior goalkeeper Kat Hess played her part in the shutout, tallying up five saves. When speaking on the environment of the night, Hess said, “It was incredible being out on that field (that) night. It was our first away game of Ivy League play, and for the seniors, it was the last time that we would have the opportunity to be a part of the oldest sports rivalry in the country. There were hundreds of fans, students, families, and friends fighting through the cold, cheering and supporting both sides, and it just made the atmosphere come to life even more.”
Although both teams went into the half scoreless, there was definitely no shortage of action. Harvard’s attack, led by DelPico, first-year forward Angela Caloia, and junior forward Lauren Raimondo, fired off shot after shot, but could not quite get anything past Yale’s keeper. On the other end of the field, the Crimson defense proved to hold strong, with Hess right at their back in case a Yale forward was able to squeeze through for a shot opportunity.
The second half began in a very similar matter to the first, as both teams searched for that one spark that could change the entire game. Finally, in the 65th minute, that moment appeared to come to fruition for Harvard. Junior forward Murphy Agnew surged through the Bulldog defense and, right before colliding with a Yale defender, centered a beautiful pass to DelPico. DelPico then took three quick touches into the box and netted a perfectly placed goal into the upper-right corner, giving the Crimson a 1-0 advantage.
“During the sequence that led up to the goal, I saw Murphy cutting towards the goal with a really hard run and two players about to challenge her,” said DelPico. “I knew I had to get into a position where she could see me and get me the ball in the box. Murphy delivered a great ball to me. I stayed composed because I knew it was a good opportunity. Instead of taking a quick one-touch shot and hoping it would get through, I took a couple touches past the defenders in the center to find a little space where I could find the top corner. I knew my team was counting on me to execute and I owed it to them to finish.”
Despite grabbing the lead, there was still plenty of time left and everyone on the team knew that they could not ease up until the final whistle, as one mistake could end up doing immense damage. Yale certainly kept up the pressure, and, in the 76th minute, it certainly looked as if the Bulldogs were going to tie it up. After a rare instance of beating the Crimson defense, senior forward Aerial Chavarin of Yale found herself one-on-one with Hess as she dribbled into the box. The game appeared to come down to this moment, and it was here that Hess deflected a rocket off of the foot of Chavarin. The unbelievable play evoked newfound energy and passion from the rest of the team, helping everyone else remain strong for the final stretch.
When asked about the play, Hess shared some very interesting insights into what was going through her head. “Growing up, I had played with and against Chavarin over the years, so I knew how fast and dynamic of a player she is on the pitch,” said Hess. “And as Chavarin was nearing the box, screaming towards goal, all the yelling and cheering quieted, and my mind was clear and steady. Knowing her tendencies and the way that she approached the ball, I was able to anticipate where she was going to shoot, and was able to get my body behind the ball. After the ball was cleared out and the play ended, the energy of my teammates both on the field and on the sidelines was unbelievable, and we fought together until the final whistle. This game was about winning our one-on-one battles together as a team, and that save was only one of the countless individual victories that led to our win last night.”
After this potentially game-saving play, Harvard regained its focus and closed the game out strongly–truly earning its hard-fought victory. With a current record of 8-2, Harvard’s women’s soccer is now riding a five-game win streak and has already surpassed its total win count from last season (7-7-1) with no intention of slowing down.
Hess, being one of the veterans on the team, wanted to improve and strive for more after last season. “The most important part of HWS is our team culture and our shared goal of reaching that Ivy League title,” said Hess. “After the ending of our 2018 season, we came together as a team and redefined who we are, what we stand for, and how we were going to compete in 2019. Our victories this season have all been a team effort, whether you’re a 90-minute starter, a sub coming off the bench, or cheering your heart out on the sidelines, every player on our team is fully bought into the values and standards of HWS. We have had ten of our players score goals for us this season, and I think that shows most in how we approach our preparation and competition both on and off the field.”
The importance of the familial culture of the team is apparent to any spectator. As a first-year, DelPico spoke to what it has meant for her to be able to join a team like this. “The number one thing that separates the Harvard women’s soccer team from other schools is that it is truly a family,” said DelPico. “Our team culture is something we all focus on every day. We have that perfect balance of being able to call each other out on the field, while still remaining best friends off the field. I’m so proud of how much success we’ve gotten so far this year, and I know we are destined for more. Our captains and coaches set the tone for the positive energy that flows throughout this team. Everyone knows their roles and knows their worth.”
With six games left on the regular-season docket, the Crimson looks to continue its success and hopefully reach the NCAA tournament. Harvard will return home next Saturday and seek to extend its win streak against Cornell (4-4-1, 0-2 Ivy League).

No. 12 Harvard men’s water polo (12-0, 3-0 NWPC) stacked up three more wins this weekend as it opened conference play. In other news, water polo is played in a pool.
With results coming in like a broken record, it was only a matter of time before the Crimson started breaking records, and the squad did just that on Sunday, setting a new program mark for consecutive victories.
The Crimson took down rival No. 18 Princeton (8-9, 2-1) by a score of 12-9 in Princeton, N.J., on Saturday to tie the record before heading to New York on Sunday to secure the milestone with a 17-15 win over No. 17 St. Francis (11-4, 3-1) at the Terrier Tournament Weekend.
Later that day, Harvard trounced Iona (2-10, 0-4), 19-9, to put a cherry on top of the weekend and stay undefeated.
This is the third weekend in a row that the team has posted at least three victories.
Against Princeton, the Crimson got off to an uncharacteristically slow start, trailing 3-2 after one quarter.
But a converted penalty shot from sophomore attacker Alex Tsotadze less than thirty seconds into the second frame knotted the score at 3-3, and for a while the game was a see-saw affair.
The Tigers snatched back the lead to open the second half, but sophomore attacker Michael Sonsini brought the score back even, and then junior attacker Dennis Blyashov put the Crimson ahead for good.
The Carlsbad, Calif., native had three goals in the game, including Harvard’s twelfth and final tally.
With three goals of his own, captain Charlie Owens joined Blyashov in spearheading the attack.
Fellow captain Austin Sechrest also scored, as did freshman defender Gabe Putnam and junior utility man Jackson Enright.
The Crimson is now 5-0 at Denunzio Pool, having won all four of its games there during the Princeton Invite a few weeks ago.
The St. Francis tilt also got off to a rocky start, but for a different reason, as a scoreboard malfunction caused a brief stoppage of play early in the first quarter.
Immediately after play resumed, Tsotadze fired in a penalty shot into the right side of the net to put Harvard up 1-0.
After the Terriers scored their first goal, Dennis Blyashov put away two goals and assisted on a third to freshman center Kaleb Archer to give the Crimson an advantage it would never relinquish.
Blyashov finished with eleven shots and five goals on the game.
Tsotadze also had a big day, recording five goals, including one beauty in the second quarter off of a goalie assist.
After Sechrest knocked away a St. Francis shot, sophomore standout Noah Hodge alertly found Tsotadze at the other end of the pool with a long lob, and the Menlo Park, Calif., native did the rest, slipping the ball past the Terrier goalie to make the score 9-5 in Harvard’s favor.
Enright, Archer, and freshman attacker Alex Bucur added two goals each.
When the final whistle blew, the Crimson held a 17-15 lead, and the team swam into the record books.
The Iona matchup was less tightly contested than the first two games of the weekend, as Harvard outscored the Gaels in every quarter and cruised into the win column once more.
Tsotadze led the team with five goals, Owens had four, and Sechrest and Archer poured in three more each to lead the Crimson’s offense.
Hodge racked up 14 saves to push his weekend total to 35, and junior Oliver Oz had three in a strong relief appearance.
Harvard had nine steals against Iona.
Tsotadze was the scoring leader on the weekend, with 11 goals.
The Crimson will be on the road again next weekend to face off against Brown and MIT.

We all know that not knowing where to keep your key is a big deal for most freshmen — and even for some upperclassmen still struggling with finding the “key” spot for their key — so we thought we would share some tips on where you should put yours.
The Classic “Around the Neck” Approach
Arriving on Harvard’s campus on the first day of college was filled with lots of excitement, free swag, and the infamous crimson Harvard lanyard. We were told by our parents that wearing our keys on this lanyard makes us look like someone who can’t keep track of things, but, so be it. Wearing a key on this high-quality crimson lanyard is easy. It’s difficult to lose something when it’s constantly hanging around your neck, and the noise of the key as it swings back and forth on the chain is a constant reminder that at the end of the day, this noisy key will be used in the process of (finally) heading back to bed.
The Easy Access, Sophisticated, Noise-Free Approach 
In contrast to the “Around the Neck” approach, this way of wearing your key requires skill and coordination, but considering its benefits, the effort is well worth it. Just take a hair tie and maneuver the ring of your key onto the end. Then, wrap the hair-tie around your key twice so that the key is no longer hanging but is instead, pressed against your wrist. As you walk around campus wearing your key in this fashion, you will not only look sophisticated, but will also show your mastering of key couture. (Warning: You might have the imprint of a key on your wrist throughout the semester).
The “I’m Too Cool to Wear My Key” Approach 
This approach to wearing (or not wearing) your key is possibly a newer approach to key fashion. With the advent of phone wallets, it’s as easy as ever to slide your key right into the back of your phone. Just make sure that your key doesn’t fall out of your phone wallet — because getting a new key is most definitely not free.
The, “Let’s Hope No One Finds My Key Under My Doormat” Approach 
For those who are the laid back type and don’t mind coming back to their dorms finding their doors unlocked with the key innocently lying on the floor, the doormat approach is the one for you. Still, don’t fret the next time your door is open and you immediately assume that someone broke into your dorm — it may just be your roommate. As should be derived from the name of this approach, this way of storing your key requires a simple doormat — but feel free to buy a super trendy one, since it’ll end up in front of your room.
And Last, but Most Definitely Not Least, the “Keychain” Approach 
These students who follow this approach prefer not to wear their keys at all, and rather enjoy the keychain way of life. Though it’s curious why these students choose to not wear their keys, it is also quite commendable. At the end of the day, why do students feel the need to wear their keys at all? Do your parents wear their keys when they go to work? Have you ever seen anyone wear their house key outside of Harvard? If you find yourself adulting throughout your time out here, kudos to you.
