After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Foo Fighters haven’t really varied their sound over the past—oh, let’s say 20 years, essentially sticking with this pseudo minimalist, oh-so grunge aesthetic that overvalues distorted, muddled sounds, and frontman Dave Grohl’s tried and true whisper-and-then-shout technique. Their new album, “Sonic Highways,” doesn’t vary up the formula. You can tell that The Foo Fighters are trying to have their audiences waving lighters around on almost all their efforts on this album, but, as it turns out, crescendos lose their effectiveness if they’re the crux of every single song on “Sonic Highways.”
The Foo Fighters seem to be somewhat aware of their formulaic approach—they’re at least trying to vary up their offerings. But god forbid they do something crazy, like experiment sonically or attempt tonal variation.  No, they’re doing the sensible thing—adding a gimmick to each album. For “Wasted Light,” their previous effort, it was the idea of a homecoming—of having an album that was to sound, according to Grohl, “like it was recorded in a house.” (Spoiler: it didn’t.) This time, it’s the idea of a rollicking, rock-and-roll road trip, with The Foo Fighters traveling to eight different U.S. cities and recording one song in each—as chronicled in the Dave Grohl-directed HBO miniseries, “Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways.” The album drives this point home with remarkable subtlety, the cover art very definitely not depicting a giant “8” nestled into the middle of a city landscape. And it’s not like there are eight songs—one per city on the album. Right? Right?
Gimmicks are fine if they actually do something for the band. Grohl’s self-importance would be infinitely more tolerable if the use of different recording locations actually yielded some variation in the songs. I’d like the Nashville piece (“Congregation”) to actually sound like Nashville, or the New Orleans song (“In the Clear”) to have, say, a bit of a baroque jazz influence. But the songs on the album don’t reflect the emotional imprint of each city at all—the gimmick may as well be nonexistent as concerns its influence on the songs themselves.
But honestly, much as I’d like the regional gimmick to actually be reflected in the soundscapes of the songs, “Sonic Highways” falls short of even presenting eight distinguishable songs. Every last one of the numbers on this album, no matter how they start, always converge to the same, arena-rock shouting number, with Dave Grohl screaming something-or-other over a cacophony of distorted guitar and bass. The Foo Fighters’ emotional palette, in the end, has only one unifying characteristic: its loudness.
This convergence is a shame, because some of the songs actually have quite interesting beginnings. “I Am a River” has a lovely, slightly-surreal intro riff that’s somewhat peaceful and wistful. But the beauty of the introduction is destroyed when the drums hit, the guitar revs up, and the screaming begins, transitioning the song into a bland, generic ballad. At least it has a passionate, deeply nuanced chorus: the words “I… / I…  / I am a river”  yelled in pretty much every way humanly possible. “Something from Nothing” also starts off promisingly, opening with a dark little minimalist lick, something reminiscent of The Arctic Monkeys or The (early) Black Keys. And then, as expected, Dave Grohl puts away his inside voice and damns “I Am a River” to the bin of wannabe arena rockers.
To be fair, The Foo Fighters still have a decent ear for hooks, and there’s some genuine musicianship exhibited on the album. But in the end, The Foo Fighters are trying far too hard to pump out anthemic crowd pleasers—and by definition, an anthem has to be relevant to its audience: something of a rallying cry for the disaffected youth or similar. But stale old rehashes of “Everlong” haven’t really been doing it for anyone since the late ’90s. The Foo Fighters refuse to realize this, however, and are trying so hard to make today’s audiences love hoarsely-screamed, muddled stadium-rockers. To be sure, this is an honest album. There’s a raw energy here, a genuine belief in the project. But, honestly, the degree of commitment vis-à-vis the actual quality of the album is embarrassing. There’s something fundamentally lame about this wasted effort—the listener is left with a small kernel of pity for this anachronistic dinosaur of an album that makes it impossible to regard with anything more than condescension.
Most of us have learned that, when yelling fails, it’s often time to try a different tack. Hopefully The Foo Fighters learn that lesson sooner rather than later.

Wherever your musical tastes may lie, it’s hard to deny that One Direction is a phenomenal boy-band. They’re a polished, expertly advertised product. You can’t really fault them for their lack of sonic experimentation, their tonal homogeneity, or their static subject matter. That’d be like criticizing a minivan for its slow acceleration or unimaginative styling: a complete and total missing of the point. One Direction isn’t trying to make some bold artistic statement—they’re asymptotically approaching the Platonic ideal of the teenage heartthrob. The band’s members—all with artfully tousled hair and wiry, boyish physiques—have cleverly assigned personalities, designed to appeal to as a wide a range of teeny-boppers as possible. The band—music, image, and all—is designed to appeal to a particular group and should be considered in that context.
The group’s newest effort, “Four,” is another entry in their catalogue of well-crafted tween fodder. The sound is homogenous throughout, landing squarely in the realm of slick pop-rock. There is some variation in tempo on the album, with a decent combination of fast-paced, energetic rockers and slow ballads, as well as a couple lighter, vaguely acoustic numbers. Still, none of it is particularly original musically, and One Direction covers their own well-trodden ground in that regard. The tunes, however, are eminently listenable and palatable. In this case, nothing new translates to nothing offensive, and One Direction’s crooning goes down smoothly, giving the listener zero cause for alarm or pause.
As far as subject matter goes, One Direction concerns itself with romance almost exclusively—as relationships are the tried-and-true subject of choice for the teenage masses. Band member Liam Payne claimed that the album would be “edgier” than previous offerings, but there is nothing here that hasn’t been said before. The song “Stockholm Syndrome,” for instance—with potential to be about the darker facets of a relationship—turns out to be another bland unrequited-love ballad, with the standard motif of the lover-as-prisoner deployed with mercenary precision.
“Steal My Girl”, the album opener, is another standard poppy piano ballad, complete with clapping-hands in the chorus. The song (surprise, surprise) also concerns itself with teenage relationships, this time focusing on the couple’s happiness and mutual love despite the fact that “everybody want to steal my girl / everybody want to take her heart away / couple billion in the whole wide world / Find another one because she belongs to me.” Standard fare, expertly calibrated to the appeal to the basic human desire to be wanted. Well-crafted, yes. But definitely not edgy. While there’s nothing new in this album, there are still some pleasurable moments that feel comfortable in their familiarity.
“Night Changes,” a slow, crooning ballad, is sung delicately, with a reassuring refrain: “Even when the night changes / it will never change me and you.” It’s almost a shame; the song, with its themes of transformation and passage of time, could have conceivably come to a less saccharine conclusion. But the sugary, reassuring alternative isn’t completely unpleasant; it goes down easily. And the song “18”—a pensive acoustic number penned by fellow teen idol Ed Sheeran—is similarly predictable in subject matter (“I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18 / I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18 / I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18,” etc.), but not musically unpleasant. It’s fine. Honestly, “Four” makes decent background music—if you can relax your focus enough to ignore the tonal homogeneity, the soppy lyrics, and the lack of innovation, the actual musical soundscape of the pieces isn’t offensive on a song-by-song basis.
For anyone outside their target demographic, “Four” is an artless, monotone product. But you can’t help but grudgingly admire the masterful control of image, the pop-rock palatability, the youthful sheen that pervades the album. There’s a strange pleasure in beholding this album—like holding a high-grade, expensive drill or some other piece of uninspired utilitarian hardware. One Direction isn’t writing for everyone, and they know it. There’s no embarrassing, dissonant artistic pretension, no attempt to latch onto an unreceptive, jaded demographic. For the teenybopper, One Direction is a delight, a product that’s unabashedly directed at and palatable to their target demographic. The rest of us can only watch in muted awe at the cold precision of this album and its laser-guided, heat-seeking ability to give the people what they want.

We all know the story.
In the heart of Happy Valley lies Pennsylvania State University; renowned for its successful football program, Penn State was led by head coach Joe Paterno for almost half a century. In Happy Valley, Saturdays meant tailgates, barbeques, and, best of all, football. Life was good. But everything changed in November 2011 when assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was charged with and later convicted of child sex abuse. The events following this controversy led to the community’s descent into madness. The late Joe Paterno was met with accusations of covering up the scandal, and the football program was suspended for four years, with Paterno’s 111 wins since 1998 expunged from the school’s record. In a place where football was a way of life, this was a death sentence. The media coverage of this event was content with leaving everything as it was: a community with a stained reputation and the devil as its saint.
Yet even with Sandusky in jail and the scandal seemingly resolved, director Amir Bar-Lev let The Crimson know that he wants to revisit the scandal that took place almost three years ago. In his documentary “Happy Valley,” Bar-Lev wishes to set the record straight and show everyone that what we think we know of this story is only the beginning.
Bar-Lev seeks to create something that will leave people with a desire for self-improvement. He speaks of empathy for people who are unable to speak for themselves. Embedded in this film is a message that people like Paterno are more than what they are made out to be: neither devil nor saint. At the heart of every person are flaws that are often overlooked. “The other folks in this story, the people who created decisions about whether or not Jerry’s crimes were their problem, have, in my mind, more to teach us in our everyday lives,” Bar-Lev says. Rather than condemning Sandusky’s crimes, “Happy Valley” informs us about the shortcomings of human nature through its candid depiction of reactions to these events.
What starts out as an examination of Sandusky’s crimes evolves into something more: an intense psychological examination of the people inhabiting Happy Valley. Some refuse to believe anything that suggested Joe Paterno was less than perfect. Others even claimed Sandusky was innocent and that the outspoken victims were liars. “I think these people are making the point of the film: when you hold onto your identity and your heroes so tightly that you cannot allow for any sense that they are fallible human beings, then you are inviting the type of problems that we have seen in this story,” Bar-Lev says.
This was a community that was deceived, and after that realization, felt a foreign sense of vulnerability and crisis in the midst of the accusations. While it may seem that these problems are contained within Happy Valley, Bar-Lev suggests otherwise. “This is a story that is in many ways a parable about fatherhood. I think Joe Paterno was a symbolic surrogate father in this community who was going to protect the community from danger, from the outside world in the same way we feel about our fathers when we are young,” he says. Indeed, it takes a dramatic realignment in perspective to understand that our heroes are just like us: human in every sense of the word.
If there is any lesson to learn from these events, it is that true strength lies not in an individual but in community. “I’m kind of an old-fashioned collectivist type, and I believe the reality is that we as a group are the only ones who can act heroically, that there are no heroes or saints out there who can save us from evil people,” Bar-Lev says. During their darkest hour, Penn State and its surrounding community showed their true qualities, coming together to show the intensely curious and observant world outside Happy Valley that their time was not over.
As a reaction to the sensationalist media coverage of this event, Bar-Lev hopes to inform as well as put forward a new perspective. “The reason I’m in the business of documentaries is to paint the world in shades of gray, to paint complex pictures. These are important because they give us empathy,” Bar-Lev says. “Empathy is what the world needs most, and what I’m proud of in terms of this film is that people from widely disparate points of view are responding to the film and seeing their own points of view fairly and accurately.” In a world informed by the black-and-white morality of media coverage, “Happy Valley” challenges us with the moral gray area, with hard questions that do not necessarily have an answer. Did Paterno and Penn State deserve to be penalized for Sandusky’s crimes? According to Bar-Lev, that is up to us to decide.
Ambiguity is Bar-Lev’s trademark here, which led to internal contention as his own opinions changed drastically during filming. “For [the interviewee] Tyler, a die-hard Paterno supporter, I don’t agree with a lot of what he said, but I think he has some challenging opinions,” he says.  “When you see a moment of silence for the victims of child abuse, which I believe is a good thing, you can see the lion mascot hanging his head down while his haunches are pouncing up and down ready to play football. You can see the kid Tyler’s point. There’s a kind of sanctimonious phoniness about the whole thing, which causes one to ask deep questions about football itself and spectacle.”
Bar-Lev’s personal experience taps into the entire essence of the film. It is not about morality or scandal. Rather, it is inherently a psychological exploration of a community during a time of crisis and, most importantly, an exercise in empathy for viewers and spectators.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of a disastrous midterm election for the Democratic Party, President Obama has declared that he will use executive actions to protect up to 5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States from deportation. Four million individuals who have resided in the U.S. for at least five years will be allowed to apply for work permits, while an additional 1 million immigrants will be covered by an expansion of existing legislation including a program for so-called "Dreamers." The proposed executive action also has its limitations: farm workers and parents of Dreamers will not be protected, and none of the five million will be eligible for health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.
In spite of what some immigration activists have denounced as the relatively conservative nature of the president’s proposal, Republicans have taken umbrage at actions that will circumvent the authority of Congress. Prominent members of the GOP, including Speaker of the House John Boehner and presumed Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell have vociferously opposed the plan on constitutional and political grounds. Though Obama’s proposal is doubtless controversial and far-reaching, it does have precedent in executive actions by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, then much less controversial.
Nevertheless, in this particular instance we are forced to side with Republicans in Congress. We wholeheartedly believe in immigration reform and the creation of a pathway to citizenship, but we also believe in doing so through a more conventional legislative process.
Particularly in the aftermath of an election in which Americans overwhelmingly supported Republican candidates, the president should not subvert the authority of Congress in using executive actions to overhaul our nation’s immigration system. Doing so would set a dangerous precedent for future executive actions of this magnitude, especially in the face of apparent voter disapproval. Obama's plan would only heighten the feeling of mutual distrust that exists at present between Democrats and Republicans.
We also take issue with the president’s proposed use of prosecutorial discretion on such a large scale. The Executive Branch has a duty to uphold the law, and Obama’s executive actions are clearly in contravention of the spirit of existing immigration legislation. Granting reprieve to millions of individuals through prosecutorial discretion alone smacks of a willful disregard for the law.
Our country is suffering under the burden of outdated and inhumane immigration policies, but we have elected a Congress that is unwilling to act. Now is the time for the American people to reflect upon the plight of undocumented immigrants, not for hasty executive actions that imperil the sanctity of the law.

The Harvard Teaching Campaign has started an important conversation on our campus about teaching and learning. The faculty of several departments and committees in the social sciences and humanities, including philosophy, sociology, English, studies of women, gender, and sexuality, and romance languages and literature, have endorsed the Harvard Teaching Campaign’s proposal for a 12-person section cap. The faculties of the various scientific disciplines have yet to comment on this proposal. Nevertheless, smaller section sizes should be a priority in the sciences, as many humanities departments have already made it.
Unfortunately, some members of the Harvard community have suggested in The Crimson’s news and opinion pages that section caps are unnecessary in the physical and natural sciences because “what is needed in a philosophy course may be quite different than, say, a statistics or math course,” because “sections [in the sciences] are about the transmission of information,” and because “a statistics teaching fellow, for example, can expound equations to 18 or 20 pupils with ease.” The belief that science courses will not benefit from smaller sections seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the goals of a science education; one where the teaching fellow could be replaced by a textbook recitation.
As teachers, students and scientists, we know that this is not an effective method for teaching science to undergraduates. Our experiences as teaching fellows in Earth and Planetary Sciences, Chemistry and Chemical Biology, and Molecular and Cellular Biology inform us that science education at Harvard will improve with smaller section sizes.
The sections that we have taught involve as much discussion and interaction as those in the humanities, because we have found that students learn better via active engagement, rather than passive memorization. As we guide our sections in learning specific concepts, we encourage our students to ask each other questions, and explain their answers.
We have found this method of teaching to be more effective than “expounding” from above because the members of the section are exposed to a diversity of ways of comprehending scientific concepts, and each student can discover which path of understanding is most helpful for him or herself. While efforts can be made to educate teaching fellows about skills for encouraging active learning in sections, we feel that the sheer size of many sections is a barrier to using these methods.
Furthermore, learning science at a college level is not simply about memorization and regurgitation of facts; rather, we are training students in the practice of scientific inquiry.
As an example, a science section might focus on helping students build the skills necessary to read and critique published papers in the scientific literature. A published paper invariably contains advances in the science as well as questionable assumptions or methods, and it is important for scientists to be able to disentangle the two. This, however, is not a skill that can be taught by a teaching fellow simply outlying his or her analysis and critique of the paper, but one that requires discussion and debate among the members of the section. These valuable skill-building activities are most effective in small sections, where every student can be engaged and active.
Laboratory section sizes should also be reduced. In introductory chemistry courses, it is common to have sections with more than 15 students. The layout of the undergraduate laboratories makes it difficult for teaching fellows to observe all student experiments in large sections. In laboratory courses students must analyze their observations and adapt procedures in response to the reality of their experiment. These experiences provide a pedagogical advantage to learning the natural and physical sciences, but require the teaching fellow to guide them.
Large laboratory sections prevent the teaching fellow from providing individual instruction. Large sections can also distract teaching fellows from ensuring safety in lab and correct disposal of hazardous waste. Smaller sections would allow teaching fellows to more readily monitor laboratory safety while maintaining attention to each student’s conceptual understanding and technical grasp of the experiment at hand.
While we sympathize with the desire to individualize section size for a given course, we hope that the size distinction is not made along discipline boundaries. Section sizes in the sciences should be reduced to effectively teach undergraduates scientific concepts, to simulate the scientific method, and to safely oversee laboratory procedures. The Harvard Teaching Campaign’s proposal will serve as a safety net across the University to preserve the high standard to which we hope to hold our undergraduates.

I just turned in a final paper. When it was finished, I gussied up the spacing and switched the font to Georgia. I stapled it neatly at a 45-degree angle, with a professional-looking cover page on top. Before my TF takes in a single word, he can deduce that I’m a smart guy and he’s about to read a great paper.
Here’s the problem: It’s not a great paper. I didn’t have a lot of points to make, so I made them glamorously. I used lots of adverbs. My title has a colon in it. There are 21 words in an average sentence, six letters in an average word. An online analysis tells me I’m writing at a 16th grade level. My TF is gonna love it.
Steven Pinker wrote in the Chronicle recently that academics have their heads too far up their own rears to write well. They know so much, he says, that they can’t imagine what it’s like to be a layman. But I think the problem is more systemic than that. Academics put out lousy writing because they went through 20 years of schooling that rewarded lousy writing.
What causes this upside-down incentive system? It’s signaling, plain and simple. You don’t have time to write good papers, and graders don’t have time to read them. No one ever got fired for buying IBM, so they slap a check-plus on whatever looks good. Consciously or subconsciously, you tune your writing to do just that: to look good. Who cares if it actually is good?
This is why my academic writing stinks. I’ll hammer out a response paper the hour before it’s due, throwing in as many “normative”s and “dichotomy”s as I can muster. “Do I sound smart yet?” my writing pleads. It’s all icing—like the staple and the font choice—layers and layers of icing on a tiny, bland cake. My TFs will often tell me I’ve improved as a writer over the semester, when really I’ve just figured out which kind of bullshit they prefer. Why risk writing something good in the hopes it’ll be recognized as good, when I can write garbage I know will be recognized as good?
This is also why section kid bothers you so much. You roll your eyes when he ends every sentence with “by any stretch of the imagination.” He’s building a McMansion of words, all oversized and gaudy and totally empty. Your TF’s eyes glazed over at the first, “Just to run with that for a minute…” She’ll give him full marks for participation. You hate him for shamelessly playing the game. But can you blame him?
This is even a driving force behind grade inflation. In a world where good ideas get good grades, the average would be around a C. Real eureka moments don’t come often. But in a world where fancy words get good grades, any skilled hoop-jumper can learn the formula and churn out regular As.
This is dangerous. The high marks seem nice today, but when we get spit out into the real world we’ll see the harm it’s done. I’ve nearly forgotten how to write simply. When I’m not paying attention, I quickly recommence pontificating mellifluously. Your boss won’t want 12 pages double-spaced; she’ll want clarity and pith. Interviewers would rather you be a real human who says things like “chill” and “legit” than some academic robot who won’t stop talking about intents and purposes.
So why not get a head start and cut the crap now? Spend more time coming up with ideas and less time beautifying them. Start your paper when you hit a thesis you’re excited about, not when you think, “I could probably argue that.” If you have a good point to make in section, you’ll sound just as smart leading with, “I dunno though,” as with, “Just to push back on that.” And to paraphrase a proverb: If you don’t have anything to say, don’t say anything at all.
It’s not our fault that the system’s broken, but it’s on us to fix it. We have to change our habits even if we’re incentivized not to. Yes, a high GPA will help you get a job, but it’s your skills that’ll help with every step after that. Don’t boost your grades by developing toxic habits. Develop good habits, and the grades should follow. When you bullshit, you’re just bullshitting yourself. Stop it. Write well.

The Verrazano was beautiful—the Atlantic on one side, the Hudson on the other. She whistled as gusts of wind raced between her upper and lower decks. And there, on those decks, over 50,000 of us ran the first few miles of the New York City Marathon.
For most of us, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge stretch was not our finest hour. It was frigid and windswept, and mists of urine from runners on the upper deck intermittently engulfed those unlucky few who decided to run near the outside of the bridge. The view was beautiful though. And we had a goal—a goal that kept us going no matter what.
The point of sharing this is not to flaunt our accomplishment, our athleticism, or our drive. (Social media is a fine outlet to let the popular kids from your seventh grade physical education class know that you ran a marathon, even if you could not finish a mile back then.) The point isn’t even necessarily that the journey was powerful and exciting. The point is the destination, the goal. And the collective consciousness of the runners of the New York City Marathon had but one—to be finishers.
When a person hears that you have run a marathon, he or she invariably asks, “What was your time?” This is a fine question. But I don’t think it gets to what really makes a finisher proud. I crossed the finish line after four hours, 48 minutes, and 36 seconds—slower than the average marathon time—but what mattered more to me is the 26 miles and 385 yards I ran in that time. What mattered more was the goal.
Getting there was crucial, of course. That’s where all of the growth happened. But what gave my marathon journey meaning was my final achievement: that when I crossed the finish line, I would enter the ranks of men and women who had successfully run hours for the sole purpose of covering an arbitrary, too-long distance.
26.1 just would not have cut it, and 26.3 would not have added much. The journey would have been much the same for either of those goals. But my goal was 26.2 miles, and that defined the journey to the finish line. To some, those 26.2 miles mean that they can accomplish anything they set their mind to. To others, those 26.2 mean another item crossed off their bucket list. For me, 26.2 meant that I control my own fate.
Crossing the finish line, I was hit with two distinct emotions. One was absolute rapture, and the other was uncertainty. We had crossed the finish line, what next? The post-marathon blues hit me hard, and forced me to question if I need goals in my life to keep me moving forward. What if I stagnate after college, with no goals in mind, just going through the motions of life?
Finishing the marathon taught me that the destination can give the journey meaning. It taught me that the way I envision the future changes the way I experience the present.
Setting goals is hard. Sometimes we pick bad ones, like goals with little behind them but a desire for recognition—an enviable social life or a prestigious career, perhaps. Other times, we fixate too narrowly upon our goals, and our tunnel vision causes us to treat other people as a means to an ambitious end, or even to neglect our self-care. And there are even goals we might not recognize because we make them subconsciously: to be happy, to get through a rough day, to support a friend to achieve one of their goals.
But no matter the goal, goal-setting itself lays the ground for a rewarding journey. Even as goals change—and boy do my goals change often—they frame our direction and growth. Goals guide much of our action, and they help us gauge whether things are going well or not. In order to know ourselves, we should think about what we are trying to achieve. With what intention do we act? What is our present purpose? Our goals reflect our values—and if some of them do not, then it’s worth noting that too.
When the runners of the 45th crossed the line, we were glad the race had happened, but mostly we were glad it was over. We did what mattered. We finished.

UPDATED: Friday, Nov. 21, 2014 at 4:12 a.m.
Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16  and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 have defeated three other tickets to win the Undergraduate Council presidential election in one of the closest finishes in several years.
Of the 3,348 total votes cast in the election—up 5 percent from last year’s tally—946 undergraduates cast first place votes for Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, only 41 more votes than second place finishing ticket Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, both veteran UC representatives, ran on a platform that centered around four F’s: funding, food, freshmen, and fear of missing out. A centerpiece of their campaign was a plan to solicit donations from alumni to increase funding for student activities—an answer to the Council’s current leaders’ failed attempt to demand funding directly from the University.
“It’s a completely overwhelming feeling. We have very few words to describe the situation and the emotion that we feel right now,” Goyal said shortly after learning the results.
The pair ran an organized campaign with a following of about 20 official staffers, several hundred supporters, and a campaign website.
The two were notified of the election results shortly after 10 p.m. Thursday. UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18 confirmed the results in an email to The Crimson Thursday afternoon under an agreement that the results would not be published until the candidates were notified.
“I am absolutely elated. I know how tough this competition was. These candidates this year were unbelievably talented, knowledgeable, and so gregarious,” Nasrollahzadeh said.
The race was the tightest in at least four years, Estes wrote.
The UC uses a Hare-Clark method to determine the winner, meaning voters rank preferred candidates, and their votes are redistributed in later rounds of tallying after other tickets are removed.
After the first round of calculating the winner, the 152 students who abstained from ranking a first choice preference were redistributed. Only about three hundred first place votes separated the Nasrollahzadeh-Goyal ticket in the first round from the last place ticket of Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 and Ema H. Horvath ’16.
Once votes for Kanuparthy and Horvath were reallocated, Nasrollahzadeh-Goyal led Yang-Jackson by about 40 votes, and Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17 by about 250 votes.
The final calculation came out favoring Nasrollahzadeh-Goyal over Yang-Jackson by about 70 votes, about 2 percent of the total voters, and marked an end to a crowded and close election.
Estes wrote that by Tuesday night, the race was “monumentally close.” On Wednesday night, Estes continued that rhetoric, indicating in an internal email to candidates that the election was “incredibly close.”
In the subsequent hours, candidates scrambled to attract voters, sending mass emails and messages to students, at times times questioning whether the election could be a four-way tie.
At one point, Estes wrote, the difference in first place votes between Nasrollahzadeh-Goyal and Yang-Jackson was just eight votes.
“[I am] obviously disappointed. It was a really close race, which means a lot of people stood behind the values and the platform that we stand for,” Yang said, later congratulating the winning ticket.
Kanuparthy and Horvath appeared relieved at the closure of the election.
“It was a lot nastier than I was expecting. I didn’t like the sneakiness. I think it kind of turns you into a different person. I didn’t like the way I was thinking when I was on the campaign trail to be honest,” Horvath said.
“This campaign is about how much the other tickets have worked. They really deserved it. They worked incredibly hard,” Kanuparthy said of Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal.
“I think that the other tickets ran incredible races—they definitely won the race,” Turban said. Prompted on why his ticket lost, he added, “I'm not going to say Luke's hairband. But Luke's hairband.”
All three referendum questions also passed, although by varying amounts.
Ninety-two percent of voters supported making Q-Guide difficulty ratings public to students, and 57 percent supported capping discussion and lab sections at 12 students. Fifty-four percent voted in favor of introducing public nap spaces for students.
Because 49.8 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, the Council will not automatically adopt as its official stance the results of the three questions. Still, the Council had already through legislation endorsed the section size gap and reintroducing of Q-Guide difficulty scores.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jorge I. Dominguez will step down from his position as vice provost for international affairs at the end of next June but will continue to teach as a professor of government, the University announced Thursday.
Dominguez, who has served as vice provost since July 2006, said that he decided to scale back his responsibilities to spend more time with his family and six grandchildren. He said he informed University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 of his decision in July.
“I haven’t sat down and counted each and every day, but my estimate is that by that time [in June 2015] I will have flown the equivalent of a full year on Harvard’s behalf,” Dominguez said. “There is a moment when it becomes one more airport security crossing, one more missed flight…. This seemed like a good time.”
During his nine years as vice provost, which followed 11 years as director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Dominguez oversaw the launch of satellite Harvard offices in China, Mexico, and Turkey. He said he hopes the University will open offices in Cape Town, South Africa over the next few months and eventually in a city in the Middle East.
Harvard has not built overseas campuses in the style of Yale-National University of Singapore College, instead opting for small global offices, an international strategy that Dominguez facilitated.
“The President, Provost, the governing boards of the University gradually came to the view that it is hard enough to run Harvard here in Cambridge and Boston,” Dominguez said. “The idea of trying to do it in some other location is too hard to conceive.”
He also expanded fellowships for students and professors outside of the United States to come to Harvard and for Harvard affiliates to study and research internationally.
“The job, my wife at one point called it, is a collage,” Dominguez said. “When I travel and people say, ‘Vice provost for international affairs, what is that?’, the easiest translation is: I was the University’s foreign minister.”
Dominguez said he is particularly proud of the development of a system of policies and procedures for keeping track of Harvard affiliates abroad. According to Dominguez, on the 11th day of his tenure as vice provost, war broke out in Lebanon, prompting the evacuation of Harvard affiliates in the region.
“I remember asking at the time, ‘How many Harvard students or faculty do we have in Lebanon?’ The answer was nobody knew,” Dominguez said. “The policies, the procedures, and institutions [now] in place were things I began my first year as vice provost.”
Administrators and faculty praised Dominguez’s time as an administrator and said they understood his decision to level off his responsibilities.
“Jorge’s done a tremendous amount of service to the University…. He also runs the Harvard Academy Post-Doctoral program, so he’s been in these major administrative roles constantly,” said Government professor Steven R. Levitsky, who referred to Dominguez as a mentor. “Not only is it physically exhausting, but it takes him away from undergraduate teaching, graduate teaching, and his research.”
Dominguez is the second high-level central administrator this year to announce his impending departure, following news in October that Christine M. Heenan will resign as vice president for government, community, and public affairs. According to Dominguez, a search committee for his replacement has not yet been formed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Housekeepers at the Boston-Cambridge DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel went on strike on Thursday and staged a rally in the Science Center Plaza to protest working conditions at the hotel and pressure Hilton to agree to their preferred means of unionization.
The strike marks the culmination of over a year of campaigning organized by UNITE HERE! Local 26, a Massachusetts-based union that represents Harvard’s dining hall employees, and the Student Labor Action Movement. Workers and protesters have consistently appealed to Harvard, which owns the hotel building in Allston but does not operate it, to help them pressure Hilton. The University has maintained that the issue should be resolved between the union and the employer.
The Doubletree campaign began after a majority of workers at the hotel signed a petition in March 2013 to launch the process of deciding whether to join Local 26. The traditional method of unionization involves a single vote supervised by the National Labor Relations Board. The protesting DoubleTree workers are seeking a fair process vote in which workers can cast ballots at any time—a method that they argue is more conducive to their shift schedules but that can only be conducted with the consent of Hilton, their employer.
Since the March 2013 petition, advocates have staged numerous protests and rallies. Thursday’s protest marked the first strike executed by housekeepers in Boston’s history.
The hotel continued normal operations on Thursday morning, according to a Hilton Worldwide spokesperson.
“19 of the 23 housekeeping department team members scheduled to come to work this morning chose to report in,” the Hilton spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.
Yet SLAM and Local 26 union advocates maintained that a “majority” of housekeepers joined the strike.
Despite the quickly receding daylight and near-freezing temperature on Thursday evening, hundreds of activists gathered in the Science Center Plaza to draw attention to the cause and rally more supporters in the Harvard community.
Hotel workers asserted at the rally that they have suffered pain and injury on the job that have been received with passivity from hotel managers. Union representatives from the Boston area, University students, and community advocates paraded around the plaza chanting “Si se puede” and “No more pain.”
Housekeeper Nelson Labor, who has worked at the hotel for nine years but has taken the last three months off due to a back injury incurred on the job, said he was thankful for the outpouring of support.
“Things have gotten better since we started fighting,” Labor said. “They are listening to us because we’ve been fighting, but they haven’t given us what we want, which is the fair process, and we hope today will get us closer.”
The rally also drew a number of College students, some labor activists and others who stumbled upon the protest. Kareli Osorio ’18 said the stories reminded her of her father, who works long hours installing carpet.
“Whenever I hear these workers’ stories, it’s kind of the same deal,” Osorio said over the beating drums and whistles of the rally. “Maybe I don’t know what it’s like to be a housekeeper and experience this pain, but I know what it’s like for their children and their families, and I don’t think anyone deserves that.”
Advocates also collected over 2,200 signatures from Harvard students and affiliates in support of the DoubleTree employees, according to SLAM member Gabriel H. Bayard ’15.
As of Thursday night, the DoubleTree hotel had taken no disciplinary or legal action against the striking workers.
“Tomorrow, we’ll see,” Bayard said. “We expect the hotel to respect the workers’ demands and respect that they are going on strike today.”

Today’s students consider food sustainability less important than students five years ago did, according to the results of a new Harvard University Dining Services survey.
This fall, 18.32 percent of students who answered HUDS’ question about sustainability indicated that it was “not important,” reflecting a steady decline in how much this issue matters to student respondents.
“[That] seems strange to me,” said George S. Qiao ’18. “It is one of the most important issues of the world today.”
The annual survey, conducted by HUDS in September, asks students various questions on all aspects of dining hall life, including allergies and diets, customer service, and overall satisfaction.
“We use the survey as a benchmarking tool in part to make sure that we’re remaining consistent and strong semester to semester,” said Crista Martin, HUDS director for marketing and communications.
Almost a quarter of Harvard students responded to the survey, although freshmen did not receive it by e-mail at the request of the Freshmen Dean’s Office and instead responded to flier advertising.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said his office has heard that students are experiencing “survey fatigue.” The FDO cut down its own survey and asked HUDS to wait until next semester to ask freshmen for more information, Dingman said in an e-mail.
This year’s new grill menu items have been a hit with those surveyed, with more than half saying they were very satisfied. Still, a change to at least one of the new items is coming, in the wake of student feedback.
“We replaced the highly processed Boca burger with two new vegan alternatives, which are locally made, but neither had the same level of protein the Boca burger had,” Martin said. “So we’re actually working with the vendor to increase the protein in at least one of them. People love the flavors but want more protein.”
For the themed brunch held every spring semester, surveyors opted for “French Bistro” as this year’s theme, chosen by 348 respondents, while “Great Gatsby” followed close behind with 331 supporters. The Feb. 15 meal will include foods like tomato bisque, crispy French toast, crepes, and sorbet.
The survey incorporated some open-ended questions, including one asking for suggestions for entrees. Some of these will appear on the winter menu.
“We have already written the winter menu, so we can take some of those suggestions and plug them into the menu, because they are easy like a baked potato bar,” Martin said.
New items will replace the weekly grill specials when the winter menu starts.
Martin said survey results should be appearing in the dining halls in the next couple of days and noted the many compliments that students gave the dining halls and the people who work there.
“They are wonderful about thanking their team, and that’s really lovely and important,” Martin said. “Our teams are working hard to make sure that they’re providing the best possible experience for everybody.”

Speaking to a select audience of about 20 student-athletes in the Harvard College Women’s Center yesterday, journalist and filmmaker Goldie Taylor recounted her childhood sexual assault by a football coach and her abusive relationship with an older man.
Taylor, who most recently worked as a political analyst for MSNBC, shared personal recollections at the discussion. Referring to Pennsylvania State University football coach Jerry Sandusky's child sex abuse convictions, Taylor said she and many others experienced similar exploitation as students.
As the Sandusky scandal progressed, Taylor said, she began to tweet her own sexual assault story, and eventually wrote a blog post in which she named her abuser, who is now a girls’ track coach in his 50s.
“[His] number [of victims] was all at once my shame and my protection,” she said. “Because what if I had said something back then? What if I had gone to someone, a knowing teacher or parent, a principal, or somebody?”
Taylor said that psychological damage from the abuse resulted in her moving in with a violent older man at age 18.
“When I was 18, the only way I knew that a man loved you was by his force,” she said. After accidentally turning a few of his white shirts pink in the wash, Taylor said, she panicked and attempted to flee. She struck him with a telephone when he attacked her but was stabbed in the shoulder as she ran.
As Taylor became a media personality, she said, her mother revealed that Taylor’s brother was the product of a high school rape.
Taylor implored her audience to be supportive of peers trying to leave unhealthy relationships.
“Be a safe harbor. Be that believing mirror when your friend or sister or brother calls and says, ‘Hey, I’m in trouble.’ Believe them,” she said. “That is probably the most important thing, the most important gift, that you can give them. Believe them.”
The small seminar was hosted by the Harvard Silence Hurts. Open Up. Uncover Violence. Talk About It. Campaign (S.H.O.U.T), which aims to raise awareness of domestic violence. Alicia Williams, a Harvard equity, diversity, and inclusion administrative fellow, served as moderator.
“A lot of [student-athletes] are student leaders on campus,” Williams said. “As leaders who a lot of people look at and sometimes blame or accuse, it’s important that we talk about these issues.”

Steven Shapin, an emeritus professor in the History of Science department, has been awarded the 2014 Sarton Medal for Lifetime of Scholarly Achievement by the History of Science Society.
The Sarton Medal is awarded every year to a scholar from the international community and is considered one of the highest honors in the history of science field. It has been awarded since 1955 and pays homage to George Sarton, who founded “Isis,” the official publication of the History of Science Society.
“This award is a very great honor for the department,” said Janet Browne, History of Science department chair. “Shapin is a distinguished historian and sociologist of science and has dedicated his career to thinking deeply about science and its place in our world.”
Shapin, who is the Franklin L. Ford Research Professor of the History of Science, said he was “very surprised” and honored to receive the award.
A group of history of science scholars from around the country who nominated Shapin for the award, including Browne, lauded his “extraordinary impact on both the history and sociology of science.”
“He is especially notable for his innovative restructuring of the way we think about science,” the nominators wrote. “In this, he has always aimed for the big issues: the nature of truth, the role of trust, the emergence of accredited knowledge, and more recently, representations of scientific identity, and the moral authority that modern science has come to hold.”
Shapin joined the Harvard faculty in 2004. He was also awarded the Erasmus Prize in 2005 along with his co-author, Simon Schaffer, for their book “Leviathan and the Air-Pump,” which talks about experimental practice in the scientific revolution.
Shapin said he is currently working on a new book on the cultural and sociological history of taste and the palate.

Starbucks switched to its red holiday cups at the beginning of this month, and Santas have already appeared in window displays around Harvard Square, but the Harvard University Dining Services staff wasn’t about to let Thanksgiving go unremarked on campus.
Last night, HUDS made the House tradition of community night into a special Thanksgiving meal. In Cabot’s dining hall, red and yellow balloons and tablecloths set the Thanksgiving scene.
The House menus featured classics: roast turkey breast, cider-glazed ham, vegetarian stuffing and—of course—pumpkin pie. The Thanksgiving-averse could still head to the grill and order cage-free egg whites and fries.
Feasting students lauded their favorites. “The stuffing was definitely the highlight,” said Rebecca H. Newman ’16, who ate dinner in Leverett House.
Shirin Al-Houssein ’15 said she enjoyed all the traditional fare Cabot had on offer, but added, “I don’t know Thanksgiving that well because I’m not American.”
Others also noted that tables at home were more varied: Chris H. Chen ’17 said he preferred the turkey to the ham, but neither reminded him of home because his Thanksgiving meal generally includes more Asian offerings.
This Wednesday, when the University closes, many students will head to their own homes to sit around a table with a traditional Thanksgiving spread similar to the one served last night in the dining halls.
Some will go to the homes of roommates or to other adventure destinations. Al-Houssein, for one, plans to go to Las Vegas with her friends, well away from a kitchen because “none of us know how to cook.”
The short break starts Wednesday and ends the following Monday, when classes resume for the final three days of the term. Even so, HUDS director for marketing and communication, Crista Martin, said the dining halls usually host several students who stay behind. Martin promised that students who stay will be able to celebrate food and community as well.
Although most dining halls will close, Adams House will stay open throughout the break, and on Thursday will offer a full New England Thanksgiving served “kind of continuously from 11:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.,” Martin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year after handing the Harvard men’s basketball team a 15-point drubbing at home, Florida Atlantic looked poised to do the same at Lavietes Pavilion early Thursday night. Behind five points from guard Justin Massey, the Owls jumped out to an 11-4 lead at the 14:37 mark in the first half.
Then their side of the scoreboard stopped working.
Harvard (2-1) responded to the initial outburst by shutting out the Florida Atlantic (2-2) offense for seven consecutive minutes as part of a 28-2 run that put the team up 19. From there, the lead never dropped below 13 in a 71-49 victory. Senior wing Wesley Saunders led the team with 19 points and six assists, making seven of 11 shots from the field and all five of his free throws.
“This entire game was about coming up strong from the start,” co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi said. “We did that today and we kept it going with our bench. It was a team effort today and we did a good job.”
After getting beat at the rim time after time against Holy Cross on Sunday, Harvard locked down the restricted area against the Owls. The Crimson had eight blocks for the game, holding the Owls to just 36.8 percent shooting from the floor and outrebounding Florida Atlantic by 14. Junior Evan Cummins, who barely missed a double-double with nine points and 10 rebounds, led the effort inside as Harvard grabbed eight offensive rebounds.
“I thought our defense was phenomenal in the first half,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That let us get out in transition when we got a defensive rebound. That’s fun basketball, and for our kids, that’s our brand and our style. I thought throughout the game, and especially in the first half, that gave us the lead and allowed us to play from ahead.”
After turning the ball over 24 times in a 58-57 loss to the Crusaders Sunday night, Amaker changed up the starting lineup. Saunders, Moundou-Missi, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers and the rest of the starting lineup hit the bench as sophomore Matt Fraschilla and senior Charlie Anastasi headlined a new beginning unit.
Afterwards, the coach—who used the same motivational tactic two years ago after a loss to Vermont—said that the tactic was intended to light a fire under the starting five.
“We didn’t feel like we played up to our standards and made a choice to go with a different lineup,” Amaker said. “Our guys responded in the fashion that I thought they would.”
“We trust our coaching staff with every decision they make,” Moundou-Missi added. “This was definitely the right decision… We learned our lesson and we got back today and played better.”
Harvard broke the game open by repeatedly getting past Florida Atlantic defenders off the dribble into the paint. Saunders repeatedly drove into the paint to create looks for cutting forwards, allowing the team to manufacture easy look after easy look. The forward trio of Cummins, Moundou-Missi, and senior Kenyatta Smith combined for 13 field goals on 22 attempts inside as Harvard poured in 38 points in the paint.
Saunders stressed after the game that the offense was focused on taking what was given to it. Against the Owls’ aggressive man-to-man defense, Harvard eschewed contested three-point tries, moving the ball quickly in hopes of finding open cutters by the rim.
The senior, who clanged his only three-point attempt of the night off the back of the rim, said that he was unconcerned with the team’s one-for-eight performance from behind the arc.
“We are going to knock down shots,” Saunders said. “It seems like there is always a point in the year where everyone is worried about our shooting, but shooting is the kind of thing where you can’t control it. There will be days where everything goes in, where nothing goes in. If we just stick to our defensive principles, we are going to start hitting shots.”

SENDING A MESSAGE
Technically, Harvard had 58 bench points in its 71-49 victory over Florida Atlantic, but looks can be deceiving.
Coach Tommy Amaker wasn’t about to let any of his players forget the 24 turnovers in the team’s 58-57 loss to Holy Cross this past Sunday. Not even reigning Ivy League Player of the Year and senior Wesley Saunders, who recorded a double-double against the Crusaders, was spared.
For Saunders in particular, Amaker made sure that the message was heard, especially given some off-court internal issues that needed to be addressed.
“Wesley played tremendously in our last game, so his [benching] was an academic [one],” Amaker said. “He didn’t live up to the standards we’ve set academically for our program as well. Standards weren’t met on and off the court, decisions were made, and that’s what we did with our lineup, and I thought the guys responded in a very favorable fashion.”
Amaker cleared his bench before the first whistle blew, leaving jump-ball fixtures riding the pine to send the clear message. Besides freshman Andre Chatfield, none of Thursday’s starters had even seen the court in the previous tilt.
Though the Crimson jumped out to a 4-3 lead in the first minute-plus, the usual Harvard reserves quickly went through a dry spell for the next five. By that point, the Crimson was down seven and in need of a spark.
Point apparently made enough, Amaker emptied his “bench” with 15:35 to play in the opening half, subbing in junior captain Siyani Chambers, Saunders, senior Kenyatta Smith and Steve Moundou-Missi, and junior Evan Cummins.
And though it took a few minutes, the core players took the game by the reins with a 34-9 run to conclude the half, holding the Crusaders to 33 percent shooting in the first 20 minutes.
THE GRIND DOWN LOW
Though the Crimson struggled from beyond the arc—shooting one-for-eight on the long ball—38 points in the paint made up for the lack of long-range accuracy.
Forward after forward clashed with the Owl big men in the post, wearing down the defense regardless of the shot-by-shot outcome. Eventually it became clear that Florida Atlantic was running out of gas by the basket.
Even when the Owls denied Harvard down low, they often spent a substantial amount of energy doing so. Midway through the second half, the Crimson spent a full minute on offense after Cummins pulled down three consecutive offensive rebounds. And after a dunk by Florida Atlantic’s Justin Raffinton to pull the visitors within 13, the Owls could not close the gap.
In the 17 minutes he was on the floor, Cummins was everywhere, snagging 10 rebounds and laying in nine points for good measure. Often overlooked in the rotation, the Westborough, Mass. native seemed to have the biggest hands on the floor in this one.
Back from his yearlong injury sabbatical, Smith showed glimpses of why Amaker sees him as a key piece in the rotation. Nine points, five rebounds, and two blocks in this one, and, perhaps more importantly, the third game in a row the Sun Valley, CA native has played in without a health incident.
“We’re very hopeful that [Keyatta] will continue to find that rhythm that he had, and when he plays like he did tonight…it changes our team.”
COLONEL SAUNDERS
Another game, another solid line for the ESPN preseason ranked 46th-best player in the nation. After recording 24 points and 12 boards in the loss at the TD Garden against Holy Cross, Saunders looked to involve his teammates more in this one.
That was especially key with Chambers struggling to find his shot for the second straight contest and buckets not falling from beyond 20 feet.
And while Saunders led the Crimson with 19 points on 11 shots, it was his six assists that caught the eye of Amaker and others on the team.
“[Wesley] has always been a tremendous passer,” Amaker said. “I’ve always thought that was the most underrated part of his game. He’s a dynamic passer…and he’s unselfish. Not only is he capable of making those passes and plays, but he’s willing.”
On four different occasions, Saunders attacked the basket, taking one or two Owl defenders with him, which resulted in open layups by Crimson teammates.
“[Wesley] is a very versatile player, and he can shoot the ball, get to the rim whenever he wants,” Smith said. “But whenever he’s able to…draw defensive pressure, it takes some guys off us, and so we always have to be ready for the open pass [from him].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column was surprisingly hard to write, and I think I have figured out why.
Really, it should have been easy. There is simply so much to talk about.
Harvard (9-0, 6-0 Ivy) going for an undefeated season. Yale (8-1, 6-1) going for a share of the Ivy title. College GameDay and what Lee Corso might put on his head if he picks the Crimson. Sam Clark doing Sam Clark things.
For the first time in a long time, the storylines justify capitalizing The Game—and it starts with the coaches.
I expect you know the backstory with former Harvard assistant and current Yale head coach Tony Reno. His move across enemy lines rekindled this rivalry three years ago.
Reno remodeled the Eli program in the Crimson’s image, and it has worked. Animosity between the programs seemed to die down as Harvard players brought to Cambridge by Reno graduated in waves. Princeton winning two years in a row diverted attention, too. But with the Bulldogs now competitive, expect the old wounds to flare up again.
As Harvard coach Tim Murphy becomes the league’s elder statesman after Penn coach Al Bagnoli’s impending retirement, Reno is emerging as a viable candidate to replace Bagnoli as an antagonist in Murphy’s story.
That said, Saturday will go a long way in determining whether Reno will play the part of pest or predator.
And the storylines get no less interesting when The Game actually kicks off. Whichever fans are sober enough to see will get to watch the best unit-vs.-unit matchup the Ivy League has to offer when Yale has the ball.
Quarterback Morgan Roberts and running back Tyler Varga lead the league in passing and rushing, respectively. Harvard, meanwhile, leads the conference in passing and rushing defense.
The Crimson defense was a question mark if not a weakness entering the year, but it will likely finish the season as historically great. Harvard leads the FCS in points against. Regardless what happens Saturday, members of this defensive unit will be able to hang their helmets on a special year.
I just know they will not be happy to do it if they cannot meet their tallest task this weekend.
See, this should have been easy to write. It wasn’t.
At first I thought I was struggling because this will be my last football Around the Ivies. It hit me leaving Murphy’s office after my 30th weekly sitdown with him that I would not be going back, so maybe I was putting pressure on myself to make this column some sort of culminating triumph—wiser and funnier than any before?
But no, that was not it. Eventually I realized what was holding me back. I’ll explain in my final picks section…
YALE AT HARVARD
This column was so hard to write because I don’t know what Saturday’s game will mean. The storylines are overwhelming. The Game could solidify Yale’s resurgence or ensure Harvard’s continued dominance.
I’ve waffled on this pick. At first I felt the Bulldogs had the talent and motivation to finally turn the tide. But the more I thought about it, the more I trusted the Crimson’s defense to stand tough and its offensive line to make a difference. At the end of the day, I have more faith in Murphy and his team to win another big game.  In a big spot against Princeton last week, the Bulldogs dug themselves a hole. Harvard will make them pay if they are not ready for the stage again.
Prepare for a great game. The history is there, the stakes are there, and the talent is there. But also get ready for perfection. The Crimson is close to achieving it.
Prediction: Harvard 35, Yale 31
COLUMBIA AT BROWN
If anybody should be celebrating Saturday, it’s Columbia (0-9, 0-6). Another wretched season is finally over. Brown (4-5, 2-4) will win this to get back to .500 after beating every team it was supposed to beat and losing to the rest, as average as it gets.
Prediction: Brown 34, Columbia 6
PENNSYLVANIA AT CORNELL
Shout out to the Big Red in advance for helping send Bagnoli out with a win on Saturday. The Quakers (1-9, 1-6) came to life last week in a 34-24 loss to Harvard, and I expect them to continue building momentum towards the post-Bagnoli era by rolling through the Big Red (1-9, 1-6).
Prediction: Penn 30, Cornell 10
DARTMOUTH AT PRINCETON
While GameDay is coming to Cambridge, this is the game on ESPN3, and with good reason. If Yale can beat Harvard, a Dartmouth (8-1, 6-1) win would earn the Big Green a share of the crown and give three out of eight Ancient Eight teams a title. Princeton (5-4, 4-2) will not make it easy though, especially after the Big Green knocked the Tigers off in last season’s finale. Still, I think Princeton is not quite the team it was last year, and that will show Saturday.
Prediction: Dartmouth 28, Princeton 20

While much is at stake at any Harvard Yale game—from bragging rights (not that Harvard needs more) to Ivy League championships—this year’s meeting of the two rivals will feature an added twist. ESPN’s famous pre-game show “College GameDay” will broadcast from 9 a.m. to noon in the Dillon Quad.
For whatever reason, this will be only the second time “GameDay” has covered an Ivy-League game—the first was in 2002 when Harvard lost to Penn—and the first time Harvard will host the show.
Hosted by Lee Corso, Chris Fowler, and Kirk Herbstreit, “College GameDay,” or more completely “College GameDay Built by The Home Depot” (has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?) is famous for the signs students poke into the broadcast’s background and Lee Corso’s tradition of donning the headgear of the school’s mascot he picks to win. One can only wonder how he’ll pull this off when he inevitably chooses the Crimson to win (will it be a John Harvard-y hat? A bucket of crimson paint?).
Besides the battle on the gridiron though, the contest for television time and the best sign will be crucial for victory on Saturday. Though there is no formula for a clever College GameDay sign, here are some ideas to get the creative juices flowing:
-"Win or Lose, We Don’t Live in New Haven”
-"If you’re not first, you’re Yale”
-"Yale: The Pepsi of the Ivies”
-"It’s OK, Harvard had an usually high number of qualified applicants this academic year”
-"Yale: Sloppy Seconds since 1701”
-"I couldn’t think of a good sign, I only go to Yale”
And remember, Saturday isn’t just about winning a football game. It’s about humiliating Yale in front of a national audience.
