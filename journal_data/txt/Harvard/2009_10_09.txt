After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s an established cliché that throughout their four years in college the majority of students will subsist on instant Ramen noodles and peanut butter sandwiches. But a new cookbook sponsored by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals encourages undergraduates to channel their inner Julia Child. “PETA’s Vegan College Cookbook” offers a slew of recipes that reinvent basic survival items—such as the aforementioned instant pasta or peanut butter—in the form of quick-fix dishes appropriate for any meal of the day.
At a cooking demonstration and book-signing event Tuesday at the Harvard Coop Bookstore, Starza Kolman and Marta Holmberg, who are involved in PETA’s youth division, prepared three of their favorite dishes from the cookbook: Seven-Layer Mexican Dip, Silence of the Lambs Shepherd’s Pie, and Boozy Beer Bread. They offered a sampling of each dish to the audience and shared their personal experiences on dealing with the difficulties of being vegans in college.
“You’re not quite sure just what to eat when you first go vegetarian or vegan, and that was one of the reasons why I was excited to work on the cookbook in the first place,” Holmberg said.
Kolman added that the compilation of recipes was the product of searching for creative ways to adapt to a vegan lifestyle in a college environment not usually amenable to special dietary concerns.
“We struggled through finding something to eat on a regular basis,” she said. “Needless to say, these recipes are something that we ate in college... and that we are able to share with everybody else.” As Holmberg and Kolman reiterated throughout their demonstration, they hope this cookbook will help make student transitions to veganism as easy a process as possible.
“We hear from hundreds of college students every year... who write to us for vegan recipes. But they want them to be easy, and they want them to be delicious,” Holmberg said.
What the recipes lack in original ingredients, they more than make up for with creative spins on preparation techniques. The most clunky and advanced piece of equipment this cookbook requires is a microwave oven. “We decided to go with the microwave simply because it’s so much more accessible than a stove or an oven,” Holmberg said. “You can find them in a dorm room, hotel rooms, offices.”
However, it might take some coaxing (and several free samples) before students are sold on the techniques presented in the book—such as using a microwave to make bread. Boozy Beer Bread, as the name implies, makes good use of another college survival item by incorporating one full can of stale, flat beer into batter, creating a surprisingly delicious treat with a texture similar to that of traditionally baked bread—but with PETA’s interpretation, one can have fresh bread in a matter of minutes, rather than hours.
Besides college-friendly snacks and appetizers, the cookbook also features its own take on comfort food classics. For Silence of the Lambs Shepherd’s Pie, Kolman uses ingredients that could be found in the HUDS serveries, such as canned vegetables, Boca meat crumbles, and instant mashed potatoes, to creat a meal even the most devoted carnivores would be hard-pressed to turn down.
From the casual demeanor of the event’s facilitators to the no-fuss nature of the recipes they prepared, Kolman and Holmberg presented an appetizing introduction to a generally misunderstood way of life. They wisely avoided a pedantic strategy in favor of a more interactive presentation; with inventive takes on classic dishes and snacks, they attempted to dispel the notion of vegan cuisine as hippie, organic food reminiscent of cardboard.
“We want to show people that if you can be a vegan in college,” Holmberg said, “you can be a vegan anywhere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
The Honorable Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, outlined a five-step plan to consolidate the United States’ prominent position in a changing geopolitical landscape to a packed Institute of Politics forum last night at an event entitled “A Tripartisan Majority for Real Change.”
According to Alee Lockman ’10, a former vice president of the Harvard Republican Club and current Crimson Design chair who introduced Gingrich at the event, over 1,000 people had lotteried for a ticket to the event, which meant that “even some Democrats were excited to see Mr. Gingrich.”
The address, which lasted for about an hour, dealt primarily with the five “fundamental realities” Americans must face as other world powers come into their own: the need for scientific and technological innovation, the rising status of China and India, the dysfunctional character of current bureaucratic and legal systems, an impending “cultural conversation” about modern values, and an “out of touch” American political system.
“If you want to live in the most productive, creative, and prosperous nation in the world, what is it you have to do?” Gingrich asked. “The answer is to reform litigation, regulation, taxation, health, education, and infrastructure.”
“Bureaucracies just don’t work,” he said. “When you build a bureaucracy, the bureaucracy ages, and the bureaucracy develops self-interest. We still don’t have an ambassador to Brazil, for example, eight months into the new administration.
Gingrich also alluded to George Orwell’s famous “two plus two equals five” mantra from the novel 1984 when discussing what he perceived as hypocrisy in modern cultural and political debates and made frequent historical references throughout his speech, many related to the twenty books he has authored or the several movies he has made with his wife, Callista.
At the end of the speech, audience members lined up to ask questions, which ranged from policy-specific topics to Gingrich’s ideas about the rising powers of China and India.
One student inquired as to Gingrich’s reaction to the Latino community’s attempts to convince CNN to fire Lou Dobbs, who offended many with his recent disparaging remarks about Mexico.
“I don’t watch Lou Dobbs, so I don’t know,” Gingrich said. “But if we’re going to dismiss incendiary people, then I can think of two or three people on MSNBC who should be dismissed as well.”
Despite Gingrich’s conservative orientation, the audience, composed of mostly Harvard students—a demographic known for being predominantly liberal—applauded generously at the conclusion of the forum.
“I expected him to be relatively forthright and candid, and he was for the most part that way,” said Kennedy School and Business School student Al Norweb. “But it’s easy to talk about two plus not equaling four, when that wasn’t always the case when he was Speaker.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citing discrepancies in circumstantial evidence, Harvard Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz questioned yesterday the integrity of a murder conviction lodged against his most recent client, a New York woman accused of hiring her cousin to kill her estranged husband.
Mazoltuv Borukhova, a Queens doctor, was convicted in March of first-degree murder after her cousin, Mikhail Mallayev, shot and killed her husband execution style in front of their 4-year-old daughter in a playground. In the midst of a heated custody dispute, Borukhova allegedly lured her husband to the playground where she had hired Mallayev to carry out the murder.
But in an interview with The Crimson yesterday, Dershowitz said the prosecution’s case prior to the conviction rested solely on circumstantial evidence that failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Borukhova had hired Mallayev to kill her husband, an orthodontist.
“That might happen on television but that’s not real life,” said Dershowitz, who plans to appeal the verdict, providing pro bono counsel after Borukhova’s family pleaded with him to take the case.
The trial against Borukhova and Mallayev was fraught with procedural difficulties that included hasty rescheduling to accommodate the judge’s vacation, Dershowitz’s brother Nathan, who is also helping with the case, told The New York Times. As a result, the prosecution received more time to prepare their closing argument than the defense.
But contrary to the Times report yesterday, Dershowitz said the appeal would not focus on qualms over trial procedure, but would seek to prove the innocence of Borukhova.
The prosecution’s case largely rested on phone records logging contact between Borukhova and Mallayev in the days leading up to the murder. Dershowitz questioned the content of those conversations yesterday, saying there was no proof that Borukhova directed Mallayev to kill her husband in those phone calls.
Borukhova has said she had provided Mallayev and his wife medical advice during the calls.
Proving that Borukhova had hired Mallayev posed a challenge for prosecutors who had records of Mallayev depositing $20,000 days before the murder but no record of Borukhova making a comparable withdrawal.
According to Dershowitz, Borukhova’s salary could not possibly have allowed her to pay Mallayev such a large lump sum.
In addition, Dershowitz said the prosecution had presented an implausible motive for the crime over the course of the trial. He described his client as a loving mother who would not have wanted her daughter’s father dead, let alone executed in front of the young child.
“She is a very devoted mother,” Dershowitz said. “Would she actually hire someone to kill her husband?”
By retaining Dershowitz as her attorney, Borukhova joins the ranks of some of this country’s most notorious defendants—Patricia Hearst, Leona Helmsley, Mike Tyson, Michael Milken and O.J. Simpson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As high school seniors wade through the college admissions process, some schools are updating their applications in a stated effort to both humanize the process and to gain more informative responses from applicants. A roundup of recent changes:
HARVARD: PLAYING PENPAL
According to Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, the Harvard admissions office is “[reaching] out in a more transparent way” to applicants this year.
“We are trying to be very respectful with students by being straight forward and accessible by returning phone calls, snail mail, and e-mails,” Fitzsimmons said.
Because budget cuts have forced the admissions office to scale back on school visits and mailings, officers have been encouraged to reach out to students individually via e-mail. Undergraduates are also running a message board for the first time this year on the admissions Web site to answer questions about the process.
“The electronic age, the accessibility of e-mails, and blogs, and Facebooks and Twitters, have all helped students,” said Deanna Smith, Head Guidance Counselor of Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Kentucky.
And while David Hawkins, Director of Public Policy and Research at the National Association for College Admissions Counseling, said he believes that the main impetus behind blogging, twittering, and e-mailing students is recruitment, he said these more personal relationships between admissions officers and applicants may help increase the transparency of the process at both ends.
PENN: GET TO THE POINT
Claire Beslow has read her fair share of application essays as a guidance counselor and former English teacher at Ramsey High School in New Jersey. One of the worst responses, she said, was to the University of Pennsylvania’s supplemental essay question asking students why they want to attend Penn.
“I had been working with someone privately who said ‘I would like to go to Penn because it’s a city school with a great campus,’” said Beslow.
“If you love the rah-rah factor of a school that’s nice to put in, but you are going for the college education. So figure out what makes Rutgers [for example] different than the University of Maryland.”
For college admissions offices, deciding what information to solicit from applicants and in what manner is an ongoing challenge. And for students, determining what information to present—and what colleges want to hear—is a source of endless stress.
“Kids are writing for acceptance as opposed to writing from the heart,” Beslow said. “They know they are being judged but not what they are being judged on, or who the reader is.”
This year, the University of Pennsylvania combined its “Why Penn” essay with a short answer asking applicants to discuss a professor with whom they would like to study. The new question now asks students how, specifically, they would contribute to the social and intellectual communities on campus.
“This strikes me as a very efficient way to get the information they are looking for,” Hawkins said.
With the number of freshman applicants steady and students’ tendency to apply to more schools each year, admissions offices will continue to sift through record numbers of applicants in the coming years, Hawkins said. In light of this, he said efficiency will be key to the admissions process.
MIT: AIMING FOR HONEST ANSWERS
MIT also changed its freshman application this year, replacing one 500-word essay with three short answers questions between 200 to 250 words.
“Part of the thinking was wanting to change the dynamic a little bit,” said MIT Dean of Admissions Stu Schmill. “The 500-word essay has become the piece that students stress about and overwrite. We’ve had shorter essays along with the long essay and we feel that we’ve gotten better information off of the shorter answers.”
Hawkins said this may have to do with the proliferation of third party application editing services, which has made it harder for admissions officers to determine who exactly is wielding the pen.
“You see a lot of college essay editing sites—not necessarily a lot of short answer editing services,” he said.
Beslow said this may have to do with students’ focus within their applications.
“I think students don’t stress as much about short answer questions—they don’t worry about making it as literary. Shorter answers are more about content than style.”
And because Schmill said “the reality is that the application is not a writing test,” short answers serve the admissions office’s purpose better.
Nevertheless, eliminating long essays may not solve the problem of ghostwriting and editing.
“We often don’t know exactly what we have in front of us,” Fitzsimmons said. But he added that “There are all kinds of ways students could get help it wouldn’t simply be on the essay.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An ideological impasse over a Harvard-sponsored residential development project in Allston has inflamed long-standing criticisms about the role of the Boston Redevelopment Authority—an especially pertinent topic given that Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, facing his most competitive mayoral race in years, is standing at the center of the controversy.
The Charlesview Redevelopment, a proposed housing complex to be built southwest of Harvard’s planned Allston campus, is nearing BRA approval after years of delays. But neighborhood activists are attacking the plan, saying that it squeezes too much onto too little land. They are calling on Harvard to commit more of its area landholdings to the project—property not designated for any future institutional use—and say that the University will only acquiesce at the Mayor’s request.
“We’re still waiting to see if Mayor Menino in the last weeks can deliver on what we’ve felt was a promise to bring Harvard to the table in a serious way,” said Brent Whelan ’73, a member of the Harvard Allston Task Force. “Will he use his influence with Harvard, or do we need a new mayor for that?”
Menino, a 16-year-incumbent with de facto control of the BRA, is known for his extensive clout in the City’s planning and development. A recent feature in the Boston Globe, noting that Menino’s support is often crucial to a project’s success, stated that “perhaps nowhere else in the nation, has a mayor obsessed so mightily, and wielded power so exhaustively” over such matters.
Thus, with Allston languishing in the wake of Harvard’s expansionary slowdown and neighborhood planning plagued by constant antagonism, some activists have shifted their attentions to the Mayor and BRA. But residents say the City has been unresponsive to community needs and that the only solution may be drastic, fundamental reform of the system.
“The most important thing we need to do is to dismantle the BRA,” said Natasha Perez, a spokeswoman for City Councilor Michael F. Flaherty, Jr., Menino’s challenger. “We need separate planning agencies: one focused on planning and one on economic development and workforce development. What tends to happen is that in the rush for economic development, planning and communities are steamrolled.”
City Councilor Sam Yoon, Flaherty’s running mate, had also championed such reforms in his own campaign until losing in the preliminary elections last month.
But City planners maintain that the BRA’s structure is effective and that it has had a successful track record. Susan Elsbree, a BRA spokeswoman, said in an interview with The Crimsom that planners have been working “tirelessly” in Allston and that “it simply wasn’t true” that community input was being ignored. “To suggest that we’ve not been doing enough to plan and hold Harvard’s feet to the fire is ridiculous,” she said.
And not all Allston residents are critical of Menino’s partnership with the BRA. Ray Mellone, chairman of the Harvard Allston Task Force, said he supports the current structure and noted that, contrary to some neighborhood perceptions, the University has not been given a free pass.
“[Menino] cuts to the chase,” Mellone said. “He goes to the University and tells them, ‘You can’t stall around.’ I think he’s been very effective.”
Nevertheless, Menino appears to be taking Flaherty’s challenge seriously. According to a story in The Globe on Tuesday, Menino has spent $1.7 million on his reelection bid—on track for the most expensive mayoral campaign in City history.
Harry Mattison, a member of the Harvard Allston Task Force and a vocal critic of the City’s planning process, said that the election was a critical moment for City reform, and that he and other Allston activists would be making their voices heard in the coming weeks.
“We’d be fools not to make the most of [the election],” he said. “This is supposed to be a democracy, not a kingdom.”

Public fanfare greeted the activation last year of the Large Hadron Collider, the massive particle accelerator that physicists hope will herald a leap forward for the field.
But the initial excitement was short lived: a helium leak only nine days after the LHC was switched on led to an explosion that postponed data collection along with the careers of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows an ocean away—including several at Harvard. In the next few months, researchers plan to test the LHC a second time, in the hope that their years of hard work will finally help unravel some of the mysteries of the universe.
“Everybody in the physics community is looking forward to that with great anticipation and Harvard is no exception,” said Christopher W. Stubbs, chair of the Department of Physics.
The one-year delay has been an obstacle for graduate students whose dissertation research depends on data from the LHC, and on postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty hoping to secure appointments, said Stubbs.
“It’s an extra year of their life and it’s a terrible thing, but when you try and do anything for the first time you have to be prepared for something unexpected,” said Thomas J. LeCompte, the physics coordinator of a key LHC experiment. “This is why I personally don’t do space physics—if your satellite explodes on the launch pad you’re in even worse shape.”
Other professors echoed LeCompte’s sentiments and said they tried to find suitable topics for their graduate students to pursue while waiting for the LHC to be up and running. “There are certainly students that have had their careers substantially delayed by this—it’s a real worry for them and I’m extremely sympathetic,” said John Huth, a professor of physics and a member of the Harvard team associated with the LHC’s ATLAS experiment. “Everybody is just chewing their nails about it, but they’re the ones who are most strongly affected.”
Even when the LHC does regain function, the future is far from assured. Paradoxically, if all goes exactly according to plan, scientists could find themselves no better off than before. “Even if it does work, if they turn it on and find nothing new at all—if they don’t find [the hitherto unseen] Higgs Boson, for example, or if they find stuff they expect to discoverer and nothing else, it is unclear what the future of that field is,” said Stubbs.
“The thing that we hope for the most is something that is completely surprising and confusing,” said LeCompte. “In science you don’t learn anything by getting the answer you expect.”
The field, physicists say, is left hoping to witness something unforeseen.
‘SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN’
Located in a huge underground tunnel near Geneva, Switzerland, the LHC is overseen by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in collaboration with scientists in over 100 countries. There are six main experiments that data collection at the LHC will service—each of which will address a different question about particle physics, Lecompte said.
Harvard has had a “nontrivial” role in building the detectors that will be used in the ALTAS project, said Stubbs.
The LHC itself consists of a 27-kilometer ring of superconducting magnets, inside of which two beams of high-energy particles are collided in a vacuum at very low temperature: -271 degrees Celsius, according to LeCompte.
When activated, the LHC will be used to examine a hole in what is known as the Standard Model of particle physics—a theoretical framework that is used to draw links between the four “fundamental forces” of the universe and the 12 elementary particles on which those forces act.
Thus far, the Standard Model has only been able to account for the behavior of three of the four fundamental forces—gravity has yet to be integrated, explained Huth.
“Gravity seems to be a missing piece [that] we can’t quite get to work with everything,” said Huth.
Huth added that physicists also do not know where mass comes from, but the most likely hypothesis is that it is bestowed by a particle called the Higgs Boson—which has never been observed.
When the particles in the LHC collide at high energies, “We’ll see huge numbers of particles coming out and every so often there will be a very rare collision that will produce some exotic form of matter,” said Huth.
It is through the analysis of this data that researchers hope to fill in the missing theoretical pieces. “This energy scale is so interesting because something has to happen,” added Huth. “At this energy scale, the theory basically breaks down unless something new happens and we don’t have a really good idea of what it is.”
The collisions may also produce or help explain the entity known as “dark matter,” which is believed to compose 96 percent of the universe, and “antimatter,” which has the same mass as matter but the opposite electric charge, explained Huth. “The Higgs Boson is the simplest model for explaining what happens in the theory and that’s what we’re designing for,” said Huth. “We aren’t under any illusions that that’s going to be the answer—a lot of us suspect nature will be more complicated than that.”
WAITING ON SURPRISES
Unfortunately for Huth, the mysteries of nature have had to be put on hold while the LHC is repaired.
When scientists were running currents through the device’s magnets in 2008, soon after its completion, a breakdown known as a “quench” occurred that caused overheating, said Joao Guimaraes da Costa, an assistant professor of physics and a member of the Harvard ATLAS team.
This failure allowed helium gas to leak into the vacuum and explode, moving the magnets and destroying a large area of the experiment, added da Costa.
The magnets are now in the midst of the long cooling process back towards absolute zero temperatures, and the LHC is slated to be turned on again late this year or in early 2010.
In the meantime, scientists are bracing themselves for the unknown.
“Nature is infinitely resourceful,” wrote James D. Wells, a member of the CERN theory group, in a recent e-mail from England, “and will keep us very busy no matter what surprises the LHC reveals.”

Raucous applause welcomed Democratic Senate hopeful Alan A. Khazei ’83, into the Upper Common Room of Adams House yesterday afternoon. Amidst a throng of supporters, Khazei entered with a pump of his fists, and as the cheering subsided, made a barely audible comment: “This is awesome. I love this.”
Known for his work with nonprofit organizations such as City Year and Be the Change, Khazei recently announced his candidacy for the position of Senator in the state of Massachusetts, a position left vacant with the recent death of Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56. Khazei was consequently endorsed by M. Maxwell T. Kennedy ’87, Edward’s nephew, and the two men made appearances at Harvard and Tufts University yesterday.
Kennedy said that the upcoming election is “absolutely, unquestionably, the most important election in this state in two decades.” Explaining his endorsement of Khazei, he said that he believes Khazei to be the only candidate who will fight for reform “without fear,” and is primed to bring new perspectives to Washington.
One concern spectators raised during the event was Khazei’s lack of political experience. Colin J. Motley ’10, president of the Harvard Republican Club, said, “people who hold state offices...have a step up” in this type of campaign.
During his speech, Khazei addressed issues ranging from his political motivations to the war in Afghanistan, while maintaining a repoire with his audience. When speaking of his grassroots campaign style, he jokingly implored students to “skip some classes” in order to volunteer for his campaign. Accompanied by laughter, he augmented his statement by advising students not to “tell your parents or professors.
Witty comments aside, Khazei provided those in attendance with an extensive overview of his campaign platform, a platform that he has come to refer to as “Big Citizenship.” Khazei noted that “for too many people, the American dream has become a dream deferred,” and said that community service is the mechanism by which America could recreate itself as a land of opportunity.
At the conclusion of the event, Khazei answered questions posed by some students who were in attendance. After responding to four questions, an aide informed Khazei that he had time for one more question.
Two hands immediately shot into the air.
“We’ll take two more,” Khazei said.

On Monday night, Andrew Mao, a first-year student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, was mugged by two unarmed men while walking near Porter Square in Somerville, a little over a mile from the Science Center.
The incident took place at 11:44 p.m., according to Somerville Deputy Police Chief Paul Upton.
“There was this car driving slowly around my neighborhood,” Mao said. “It stopped and backed up when the drivers saw me coming towards them. Two people jumped out of the car and waited on the side of the road in a dark spot.”
When Mao walked past them, he said they began to punch and kick him.
“They were pretty bad at it. It didn’t hurt very much,” said Mao. His shouts attracted the attention of neighbors, who called the police.
After Mao dropped his phone, he said one assailant said “I got his phone,” and the two left, leaving their vehicle. Police later towed the car.
Mao and another neighbor gave the police a description of the two assailants.
Two men matching the description were apprehended nearby, one with the keys to the towed car, Mao said.
According to Upton, the suspects were then charged with unarmed robbery.
Despite the mugging, Mao said of the neighborhood, “it’s a pretty safe neighborhood in general.”
Mao, who studies Computer Science at the GSAS, spent four years at the University of Pennsylvania, a campus with a higher incidence of robberies than Harvard, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Education.
“It’s ironic that I didn’t get mugged in four years at Penn, but did in less than two months at Harvard,” he said.
Mao said he feels some empathy for his assailants.
“Some people can be in dire situations...The recession has probably made people a lot more desperate.”
Statistics from the Somerville Police Department, however, suggest otherwise.
“Robberies since September 1st are experiencing a slight increase, but that robberies since January 1st are generally down,” Upton said. “Crime, especially against people, is like a heartbeat. It goes up and down.”
He added that some of the robberies seem connected. There have been four arrests in the Porter Square area in the last week.
Steven G. Catalano, spokesman for the Harvard University Police Department, declined to comment.

A team of scientists at Harvard, MIT, the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and the University of Massachusetts Medical School announced yesterday that they have deciphered the three-dimensional structure of the human genome.
This discovery expands the current understanding of how cellular DNA folds at scales more miniscule than the double helix.
“Scientists have not really understood how the double helix folds to fit into the nucleus of a human cell,” said co-first author Erez Lieberman-Aiden, a researcher at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and in the laboratory of Eric S. Lander at the Broad Institute. “This new approach enabled us to probe exactly that question.”
In the paper featured this week on the cover of the journal entitled “Science”, the researchers reported two major findings that contributed to answering how our cells stowed three billion base pairs of DNA while maintaining access to functionally crucial segments.
First, the scientists discovered that human genome is divided into two separate compartments of active genomes and unused DNA.
Chromosomes repeatedly snake in and out of the two compartments as their DNA alternates between active, gene-rich and inactive, gene-poor stretches.
“Cells cleverly separate the most active genes into their own special neighborhood, to make it easier for proteins and other regulators to reach them,” said Job Dekker, a senior author of the paper and associate professor at UMass Medical School.
Second, scientists observed that DNA was compressed into an architecture called a “fractal globule”.
This configuration deviates from the previously-proposed configuration of an “equilibrium globule”, and allows cells to pack DNA incredibly tightly while avoiding knots and tangles that might interfere with the cell’s ability to read its own genome.
“Nature’s devised a stunningly elegant solution to storing information—a super-dense, knot-free structure,” said senior author Eric S. Lander, director of the Broad Institute.
Key to the current work has been the development of a new Hi-C technology, which allowed researchers to create a spatial map to conduct genome-wide analysis of the proximity of individual genes.
“This paper offers just a rough sketch of the genome, and the technology is capable of offering a much higher resolution picture,” Lieberman-Aiden said.
“We’d like to try and do more sequencing so that we can understand things in a higher resolution,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the aid of a $4.5 million federal grant, Harvard Medical School and two affiliates are embarking on a project to sequence the genes of 85 patients suffering from autism in the hopes of better understanding the causes of the mysterious disorder.
No clear cause of autism has yet been discovered, and though past research has suggested genetic causes, only a dozen genes have been linked to the disorder.
The researchers—working at the Medical School, Children’s Hospital, and the Broad Institute—say this project differs from past endeavors because it utilizes new, more powerful technology to sequence the exome—the set of DNA that explicitly codes for proteins.
Harnessing more powerful computers gives researchers “a sharper knife to a familiar problem,” said study leader Christopher A. Walsh, a Medical School pediatrics professor.
If the group is able to sequence the genome of the patients, researchers said they will be able to better identify the specific mutations that cause autism. The grant, issued by the National Institute of Mental Health as part of billions in federal stimulus money, gives the group 18 months to conduct the funded research.
“There is no explanation for what causes the condition,” Walsh said. “We want to bring as much clarity as we can for that discussion.”
The information could provide valuable insight for doctors, patients, and their families.
“An amazing aspect that I think is particularly salient about the genetics aspect of the research, especially in the clinical setting, is that it provides some hope and a set of answers for families,” said Clement J. Bottino, a physician in a developmental health clinic in Children’s Hospital.
Bottino stressed that autism is particularly difficult to diagnose and deal with because the children have difficulty with social interaction.
The fairly new fairly new method of genome processing may be able to help address this urgent concern of how to diagnose the disorder.
“The more we discover about genetic mechanisms, the more we can develop treatment in the future,” Walsh said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A study published in July by a Harvard-Smithsonian Center postdoctoral student has uncovered important clues about the disputed explanation for dwarf galaxies beyond the gravitational effects of the Local Group, a group of more than twenty galaxies including the Milky Way.
In the study, entitled ‘Resonant stripping as the origin of dwarf spheroidal galaxies,’ Elena D’Onghia explained the existence of dwarf galaxies on the outskirts of the Local Group, and found that slightly lower mass galaxies seemed to rotate around slightly larger galaxies which in turn stripped the smaller galaxies of their luminous matter. She coined this process “resonant stripping.”
These “ultra-faint” dwarf galaxies, which lack stars and gas and are mainly composed of dark matter, were previously thought to be accredit only by galaxy-galaxy harassment, in which one large galaxy such as the Milky Way stripped a much smaller galaxy of its luminous matter.
Gurtina Besla, a Ph.D. candidate at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and D’Onghia’s co-researcher, explained that this study took a new perspective by looking at the interaction of galaxies that have similar masses.
“[This study] shows the importance of difference scales and thinking of small group environment [and] the interactions of these small things,” she said.
She added that it marked the “next stage of modifying our thinking” about the formation of the universe.
Previous studies did not look at the relationship between two similar sized galaxies, rather only the relationship between large galaxies and dwarf galaxies because that is how the majority of the universe is composed today.
According to Lars E. Hernquist, professor of astrophysics and another co-researcher, D’Onghia’s findings are important because they uncover specific properties about the formation of galaxies. With her findings, astronomers have another clue as to how galaxies interacted in the younger universe. He explained that this information can help eventually explain how lighter galaxies, such as the Milky Way, were formed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fluid dynamics researchers Jacy C. Bird and William D. Ristenpart were doing routine experiments on water droplets, when the supposedly predictable outcome failed to materialize. Instead of coalescing as expected, the charged water drops they were testing began repelling each other—a result that seemed to fly in the face of elementary science.
Last week, they published their accidental discovery that oppositely charged water drops will not stay together in strong electric fields. And the authors say their finding sheds new light on how oil companies, which must condense water droplets as part of the refining process, can operate more efficiently.
As part of the refining process, oil companies use electric fields to separate the oil and water both present when oil is drilled. That process of electrocoalescence, an amped-up version of what naturally occurs with oil and vinegar in salad dressing, uses electric fields to make oppositely charged water drops coalesce with one other, which helps fully separate them from the oil.
But Bird said the findings suggest this process will only work up to a certain voltage.
“What’s new is that above a critical electric field, the water drops show a direct contact and repel—against what is believed [will happen],” said Bird, a Harvard doctoral student in engineering. Instead of infinitely increasing the coalescing speed of water, an electric field above the critical level causes the drops to deform, combine briefly, and then repel, never actually coalescing.
The explanation for this new find, according to Bird, lies in the geometry of electrically charged water drops. While normal, uncharged water drops have round curves, charged ones have parabolic curves. So while normal drops repel or coalesce upon contact depending on the size of the drop and speed of collision, the unusual shape of charged drops causes them to come together briefly then separate.
“The electric field is bringing the drops together until they contact, and then it’s just geometry from there on—nothing to do with electric fields,” said Bird.
The implications of these findings are being investigated by Ristenpart, one of the original researchers at Harvard who has since become a professor of chemical engineering at the University of California, Davis.
“Right now, we’re trying to understand what is going on fundamentally,” said Ristenpart. “This is a very counterintuitive mechanism taking place. There’s other situations as well, like sometimes a smaller daughter droplet is emitted.”
Ristenpart said he believes that the practical applications will extend beyond the petroleum industry.
“I’m hopeful that this new observation might stem new experimental work on how charge is conducted from storm clouds,” he said. “Also, sources of biofuels have to do with much wetter systems, so potentially you can have more water-based systems too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four receptions for 50 yards.
Last season, that line would sum up a pretty average half for Matt Luft. After the senior wideout served as a talented understudy for star Harvard receiver and fellow Thousand Oaks High School grad Corey Mazza ’07-’08 for two years, Luft broke out on his own last season with a stellar junior campaign.
He hauled in 54 catches for 914 yards in 2008, making the All-Ivy First Team and helping the Crimson to its second-consecutive Ancient Eight championship.
But this season, Luft has been all but invisible, those four receptions and 50 yards accounting for his total statistical output. His only real highlight came in the night game against Brown two weeks ago, when he made a twinkle-toes touchdown catch in the back of the endzone.
So why has Luft suddenly fallen from prominence? A big part of it is that opposing defenses know all about him now, and they’ve been sticking their top corners on him while hounding him with double coverage.
Another factor could be the absence of graduated quarterback Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09. While junior Collier Winters has done a fine job behind center, his game revolves around short passes and long runs. Pizzotti had more of a tendency to air the ball out, and at 6’6, Luft is a prime deep-ball target.
Not to mention that Luft has been somewhat banged up—Harvard coach Tim Murphy chose to sit his No. 1 receiver last week in an essentially meaningless non-conference game against Lehigh.
But tomorrow at Cornell, Luft returns to the field, and don’t be surprised if he turns in a vintage performance. Junior Chris Lorditch has proven himself a viable option at receiver, and has been Winters’ favorite target this season. In addition, senior Mike Cook, junior Marco Ianuzzi, and sophomore Adam Chrissis—among others—have provided solid depth at the wideout position. What all this means is that the Big Red defense won’t be able to sit on Luft, and the well-rested big man should have some room to run.
Let’s make some picks for Week 4.
COLGATE (5-0) AT PRINCETON (1-2, 0-1 IVY)
These two teams faced off last night, after this column was written. Judging by how awful Princeton has been (the Tigers lost 38-0 to Columbia last week) and how Colgate has made its bones this season by destroying bad teams, you can give me the benefit of the doubt when I say that my prediction remained unchanged following the end of the game.
Prediction: Colgate 35, Princeton 20
DARTMOUTH (0-3, 0-1 IVY) AT YALE (1-2, 0-1 IVY)
In The Crimson’s football season preview issue, I picked Yale to finish second-to-last in the Ivy League this season. At the time, I was half joking, half trying to be different than everyone else. I didn’t actually think that Bulldogs were the worst team in the Ivy League (non-Dartmouth division), and I’ve picked them to win every week.
Well, maybe I should’ve stuck to my guns. Besides a guaranteed W over lowly Georgetown, Yale has been an utter disappointment. Lucky for the Bulldogs, they get the Big Green in Week 4. Dartmouth did show some life last week, losing by just six to Penn. But this is still Dartmouth we’re talking about. The last time the Big Green won a game, “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and you thought knowing the whole dance was a skill that would always come in handy.
Prediction: Yale 30, Dartmouth 17
NO. 20 HOLY CROSS (4-0) AT BROWN (1-2, 0-1 IVY)
Patriot League titan Holy Cross already dispatched its toughest Ivy League opponent when it beat Harvard in Week 1, and now the Crusaders can expect an easy conquest of their remaining Ancient Eight foes, Brown and Dartmouth.
While the Bears still have a chance to pick themselves up in the Ivy title race, Brown has not looked good thus far. Its 24-21 loss to the Crimson was not as close as the final score indicates, and the Bears’ only win came last week against the remarkably brutal Rhode Island.
That win doesn’t exactly inspire confidence that Brown can stop Crusader field general Dominic Randolph and company as they march into Providence tomorrow.
Prediction: Holy Cross 28, Brown 21
BUCKNELL (3-2) AT PENN (1-2, 1-0 IVY)
Don’t pay attention to Bucknell’s record. The Bisons have been feasting on weak opponents like Marist and Georgetown to get over .500, but any half-decent Ivy team should have no problem taking them down (See Bucknell’s 33-9 loss to Cornell).
As for Penn, I’ve been touting this team all season, but I’m starting to get a little worried after the Quakers only managed to beat Dartmouth by six last week.  Let’s see if they can win more convincingly this time around.
Also, I highly recommend that anyone reading this online heads over to the Penn Athletic Department’s website immediately to watch the “Al Bagnoli Show,” featuring the Quakers’ head coach. It’s thoroughly unentertaining, but a great idea. I’d like to lobby the Harvard Athletic Department right now to begin developing the “Joe Walsh Show.” I give it three weeks before a major network decides to give the Harvard baseball coach a multi-year contract.
Prediction: Penn 24, Bucknell 20
COLUMBIA (2-1, 1-0 IVY) AT LAFAYETTE (3-1)
I know I already mentioned this above, but, 38-0. Columbia beat Princeton last week, 38-0. This team has been a dark-horse favorite of many for a while, and now might be the Lions’ time to come into the light. I’m not saying they’re going to take the Ivy title, or even finish in second or third place. But the days where an Ancient Eight team could preemptively mark its game against Columbia down in the win column are long gone.
Prediction: Columbia 17, Lafayette 13
HARVARD (2-1, 1-0 IVY) AT CORNELL (1-2, 1-0 IVY)
If you want a preview of this game, there’s one to the left of this column, or—for those of you in the 21st Century— a few clicks away. I’m going to use this space to issue a few mea culpas.
First, I wrote in last week’s column that after the night game against Brown, Harvard “might not see their audience hit four digits at a home game for the rest of the season.”
That’s completely untrue. In 2007 (when The Game was last at Yale), the Crimson had an average home attendance of 12,405. My bad.
Also, two weeks ago I began my column with a “sonnet.” Actually, no. A sonnet has 14 lines. The mediocre attempt at poetry I churned out had 10. So much for my Harvard education.
Prediction: Harvard 30, Cornell 20

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So far, Crimson football has lived up to its standing as the preseason favorite in the Ivy League. On a two-game win streak, Harvard is proving its offensive prowess and defensive coordination. But the real test will come tomorrow, when the Crimson will reveal whether or not they will be the leaders of the Ivy League.
Harvard will head to Cornell for its second Ancient Eight game, as well as the team’s second road trip in as many weeks.
The athletes are quick to explain that they prepare for each game with the same ferocity, but there is a sense of added importance to Saturday’s game.
“There’s definitely added attention and focus,” junior quarterback Collier Winters said. “We have to make sure that we don’t slip up.”
Cornell is coming off to a hot start. Two weeks ago, the Big Red surprised Yale, 14-12, mirroring last year’s early upset over Yale, when Cornell defeated the Bulldogs, 17-14.
“It seems like they start off each year and get a lot of wins,” Winters said.
In its game against Yale, the Big Red proved that it’s a distinguished defensive force. The Crimson will have to take notice of senior middle linebacker Chris Costello, who earned the title of Ivy League defensive player of the week after contributing to the containment of the Bulldogs to just 238 yards and one touchdown.
Junior defensive back Emani Fenton and sophomore Rashad Campbell both had a series of pass breakups against Yale. Fenton notched five, while Campbell knocked down seven.
“They run a different defense,” Winters said, referring to the 3-3-5 defensive run that only Cornell and Princeton play. “But we have new pass plays.”
Offensively, the Crimson already has an advantage when compared to last week. Senior wide receiver Matt Luft, junior running back Gino Gordon, and freshman running back Treavor Scales will all return to the field on Saturday after missing last week’s game.
“We haven’t had any more injuries since we had a rash of ones right before the Holy Cross game,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’re hanging in there.”
But the Crimson’s offense shouldn’t be complacent.  The Big Red’s wide-open offense comes equipped with many creative formations.
“They have a lot of trick plays, and they like to throw the football,” Murphy said.
And although Cornell suffered a crushing defeat to New York rival Colgate, Murphy concedes that Cornell may pose more of a challenge to Harvard than most people think.
“They’re 2-1, they’re 1-0 in the league, so it’s going to be, on paper at the very least, a much bigger challenge than it was a year ago and a much bigger challenge than the game we had on the road last week,” Murphy said, referring to the Crimson’s decisive 28-14 win last weekend at Lehigh.
Last week, Cornell wide receiver Bryan Walters’ 234 all-purpose yards was his third-best single-game total and his seventh-career 200-yard game. The Big Red enjoyed an interception by Josh Gajdos, the team’s fifth interception in three games this season—a significant improvement from its 2008 season in which Cornell only had a total of five interceptions in the entire season.
The Crimson should also take notice of freshman safety Andrew Brown, who made seven tackles last week, and sophomore safety Travers Schmidt, who made five tackles against Colgate. Each made his first career varsity appearance against the Raiders.
But indeed, the Crimson feel prepared to defend its ranking and continue as the sole leader of the Ivy League.
“There’s been a ton of film studying, and we’re going to play a complete game from start to finish,” captain Carl Ehrlich said. “We’re going to play every quarter with everything we’ve got.”
And the Crimson has proved that it’s a force to be reckoned with from all sides of the field. In Harvard’s last away game against Lehigh, the Crimson defense forced five turnovers, including four interceptions.
Harvard allowed only seven first downs in the first three quarters, while quarterback Collier Winters threw two second-quarter touchdowns, and Cheng Ho scored two touchdowns in his first start of the season.
And according to Coach Murphy, the Crimson’s versatility may be the key to victory on Saturday.
“Our strength is we can do a lot of different things,” Murphy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team returned home to Blodgett Pool last night after a string of away games, and defeated CPWA opponent, the Connecticut College Camels, 13-4.
With this win, the Crimson extends its Northern Division winning record to 3-0 on the season, and gains momentum before a much anticipated weekend match-up against Brown.
The Crimson opened up a solid 4-1 lead in the first six minutes of play. Harvard held its three goal lead through most of the first period, but Connecticut College battled back, scoring with just over a minute to play in the quarter.
With 25 seconds left on the clock, the Camels took another shot on net that sophomore goalkeeper Alexandre Popp batted down.
Despite a descent into sluggish play to close the period, the Crimson still managed to escape with a 4-2 lead.
“We generated the opportunities,” said Harvard coach Erik Farrar after the game, “but we have to continue to work on putting them away.”
The Crimson showed more aggression in the second period, scoring twice within the first minute of play to widen its lead to 6-2.
Harvard’s defense stepped up its intensity as well, shutting down a Camel charge midway through the period, to create additional scoring chances.
Crimson sophomore Mike Katzer, stole the ball and sent it up the pool to fellow sophomore Kevin DiSilvestro who skipped one off of the water and up into the back right corner of the net.
DiSilvestro attacked the opposition on both ends of the pool through the entire game, tallying a total of four goals against the Camels, as well as a number of defensive steals on the other end of the pool.
“Kevin played a great game,” said Harvard senior captain Egen Atkinson, the current CPWA Northern Division player of the week. “He had four or five goals the last time we played [Connecticut College], so he’s definitely got their number.”
Harvard’s defense slowed a little in the last minutes of the second period, allowing Connecticut College’s Connor Matzinger to put one past the Crimson’s keeper, bringing the score at the end of the half to 7-3.
Matzinger opened the third period with another goal, but after that the majority of the quarter was played around the Camels’ net.
Connecticut College found itself at a major disadvantage in the third due to player penalties, and the Crimson was able to capitalize on these costly errors.
Katzer had another defensive steal and linked up again with DiSilvestro, who quickly crossed the ball to junior Jeff Lee.
Lee shot high into the left side of the net, tallying one of his three scores on the evening.
The offense had a number of great pass plays throughout the game that allowed it to transition quickly and catch the Camels off guard.
“We were moving the ball around well tonight,” DiSilvestro said. “My teammates were setting me up with some great passing and assists that made it easier to score.”
The Crimson held a 9-4 lead beginning the fourth period.
Harvard junior Alex Thompson converted on a pass from freshman Max Eliot 16 seconds into play.
Less than a minute later, DiSilvestro took the ball down the pool with no defenseman between him and the Connecticut College goalie.
DiSilvestro threw a few fakes and then rocketed the ball overtop a ducking keeper.
Katzer and DiSilvestro would each tally another goal before the end of the game, bringing the Crimson’s final margin of victory to 9 goals.
Harvard looks to carry momentum from this game into a matchup against Ivy rival Brown this weekend.
“We are really looking forward to this weekend,” Atkinson said. “We’re planning to come out and show what we have been training for and that is the focus of the team right now.”
The Crimson remains home this Saturday to face Brown in Blodgett Pool for a 4:30pm game start time.
Sunday afternoon Harvard will take on Iona at 2:30 pm, also at Blodgett.

House intramural fanatics may have noticed that over the past month Mather has been conspicuously absent from the competition list. Well, you weren't mistaken.
After Mather's IM teams missed a number of games this season, chaos erupted over the ever entertaining Mather-open list last week.
"It pains me greatly to see Mather IMs go under," one undergrad wrote. "I noticed the emails about still not having reps?...I'm still hoping a couple people will step up and organize teams..."
What's this about not having an IM rep? Not so fast! FlyBy has the real answer after the jump.
According to Jason B. Kleban '11—who became the IM rep only this week—a non-resident tutor in the house was officially listed as the IM rep for the beginning of the year. That tutor, who could not be reached for comment, was responsible for compiling lists of team members and sending reminder emails about games to the house.
It is still unclear why a tutor and not an undergraduate student was appointed as Mather's IM rep (as is the practice in most other houses).
Matherites were, for the most part, under the impression that Mather simply did not have an IM rep. The result: just a little bit of panic... just a little.
After several of these "frantic emails," Kleban says, "At one point I sort of got dragged into it, and I posted all of the future games for the rest of the season, so hopefully we won’t have any more forfeits the rest of this season."
Not to worry, Mather, you've still got two seasons to catch up on points.

The kids are “sleepwalking” through their rehearsals, even though sectionals are just a few bars away. What’s gotten into the team, and how will Mr. Schue get them back in the zone? Meanwhile, Sue plots to destroy Will by stirring up the Will-Terri-Emma-Ken love rectangle… (spoilers after the jump).
Turns out that New Directions is in an easy-sounding bracket for sectionals – the team only has to beat the Dayton School for the Deaf and Jane Adams Academy, a “halfway house for girls just getting out of juvie,” to make it to regionals. (This is the show’s second unkind potshot at deaf teens, although if this is the same fictional school that humiliated McKinley High’s football team, then maybe our heroes shouldn’t celebrate just yet.) Emma and Will decide to hold a guys vs. girls contest to keep the kids motivated, with the winning team choosing the club’s opening number. Finn’s overextended, though, and Quinn’s low on energy what with being preggers and all. Luckily, though, Sue plants marital suspicions in Terri’s mind and convinces her to become the school nurse to spy on Will and Emma, so now the kids have an unlicensed practitioner to help out. It’s okay, though – “it’s a public school.” Her solution for the entire club: Vitamin D! Pseudoephedrine. Suddenly the kids are on top of school and enthusiastic about their extracurriculars. Finn even wants to build a house with Habitat for Humanity. Omg, hooray: it’s like Harvard!
Meanwhile, Quinn is increasingly ostracized for her pregnancy, and Rachel reaches out to her, despite, um, Quinn’s history of drawing porn of Rachel in the bathroom (wtfuck?). Terri decides to neutralize Emma by goading Ken into proposing to the “doe-eyed little harlot.” Emma calls Terri out on her monstrosity (“He deserves a lot better than you.”) and Mrs. Schue fires back (“You’re so innocent that you would steal a man away from his pregnant wife.”) in a verbal catfight that might best last week’s. Terri continues her rampage, finally getting Quinn to agree to giving up her baby but quashing the cheerleader’s extortion attempt. Ken proposes, and it’s a genuinely sweet moment. We’d feel sorry for him … except that Emma says yes.
Eventually, the kids do the right thing, and both teams withdraw from the intraclub competition and confess to their drug usage. Unfortunately, poor Howard, Terri’s stooge and supplier, gets arrested on crystal meth suspicions, and Principal Figgins loses faith in Will and Terri, firing Terri and assigning Sue as glee's new co-chair. Delicious.
Musical Numbers
Mashup: “It’s My Life” by Bon Jovi and “Confessions Part II” by Usher
Well, now we know why Finn seemed so bubbly in the previews. Despite the excess enthusiasm, the number works. The mashup is clever, and the songs resonate with Finn’s need to reclaim control of his life. One of FlyBy’s ongoing concerns is Cory Monteith’s limited vocal range, but he sounds great here. We hope more of his future parts focus on vocal power rather than acrobatics. It’s nice to hear Artie featured again, too, and the energetic choreography makes the smoothest incorporation of the wheelchair we’ve seen so far. All around, a good number.
B+
Mashup: “Halo” by Beyoncé and “Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves.
Rachel comes off a little too fierce rather than sunshine-y, and the songs don’t mesh quite as well as in the other mashup, but FlyBy loves the fun sundresses and the bounciness of it. The number skirts the line of being too cute, though. A little more and it could be a Target commercial. And what was up with that last note?
B …but as Rachel points out, maybe my gender makes me biased.
Missing Plotlines
Sue’s Corner
We’re v. happy we got more than a full dose of Sue this week, as we learned that she likes kicking children off her team at random, beef bone smoothies, and hovercrafts. We’re also enjoying the running joke about Will’s alleged perm, although we were shocked at Sue's violence toward a senior citizen. Also, we’re tickled that Sue was born in the Panama Canal Zone and still ran for office twice. Admirable.
Best line of the week: Sue’s description of Emma as “a real floozy and a man eater,” a “mentally-ill ginger pygmy with eyes like a bush baby.”
The Short Version
We realize that the episodes are always about different characters, so we were due for a story focusing on the adults, but they’re just not as fun as the kids. And as usual, way too much happens in one episode, but at least this week it felt like the characters had a little room to breathe. Rachel, Quinn, and Ken all got fleshed out more sympathetically.
Overall: B. Not every episode can be a showstopper, but if Glee settles into having episodes like this one as its baseline (instead of episodes like “Acafellas”), we are so on board.

It looks like Harvard isn't the only powerful institution currently freaking out (read: overreacting) about the spread of swine flu with its Purell propaganda and single-bedroom quarantines. Yesterday, The Massachusetts House approved a bill (with a vote of 113-36) that would give health officials the authority to isolate infected individuals and mandate vaccine administration, as well as perform a few other questionable practices. (We're guessing that these don't involve delivering get-well meals to those quarantined.)
In August of this year, while the Bill No. 2028 was still on the table, NaturalNews.com identified several specific excepts of text from the bill that could indicate potential civil rights violations in the works.

Massachusetts State Senate Bill, No. 2028 lists the following as possible realities in the event of illness outbreak:
(1) to require the owner or occupier of  premises to permit entry into and investigation of the premises . . .
(4) to restrict or prohibit  assemblages of persons . . .
(8) to procure, take immediate possession from any source, store, or distribute any anti-toxins, serums, vaccines, immunizing agents, antibiotics, and other pharmaceutical agents or medical supplies located within the commonwealth as may be necessary to respond to the emergency. . .
And also:
As outrageous and inconvenient as this new law might seem, the punishment for not complying to quarantine orders can consist of a 30-day jail sentence and/or a $1000 fine. UHS is starting to look pretty tame, isn't it?

“Oh Harvard Lampoon, must you ruin everything that's sacred?” asks the Globe. Well, we can’t remember the last time the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine did much of anything, let alone ruined something through satire, but it looks like they're giving it a try this year.
The 'Poon has announced the completion of its second parody novel, Nightlight: A Parody, a satiric take on the oh-so-popular Twilight phenomenon. The book follows Belle Goose, a young girl who becomes convinced the new boy in school is a vampire and her soulmate, despite evidence that he thinks girls are "repulsive." The Edward character from the real novel  goes by Edwart in this version, a name which the book itself informs us is "Much funnier than Edward."

The Lampoon's first parody book, Bored of the Rings, dates back to 1969, so we're not sure why it took this long to produce a follow-up that's 16 pages shorter, nor what the criteria were for choosing the new target. Still, we're curious to see how the pamphlet does. The official press release, book blurb, and excerpt all emphasize Edwart’s “zero interest in girls." (The insinuation, we think, is that he may be a homosexual.)
The official release date is November 3rd. In the meantime, Random House has posted an excerpt.
A Lampoon spokesman said no one was available to comment on the book they're currently trying to promote.
