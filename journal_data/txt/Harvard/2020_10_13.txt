After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This review contains major spoilers
A sage cartoon pig, an “Oklahoma!” pas de deux, and an oppressively warm farmhouse in the dead of winter. Jessie Buckley plays a doubtful woman concerned about her relationship with her new boyfriend, Jake (Jesse Plemons), as they shuttle through this surreal and unnerving wintery landscape. “I’m Thinking Of Ending Things”(2020) takes the simple story of meeting-the-parents and makes everything go odd.
The film, an adaptation of the novel by Ian Reid, is the latest in writer and director Charlie Kaufman’s growing existentialist filmography. Beginning with his screenplay for “Being John Malkovich” (1999), Kaufman’s conversation-heavy, idea-driven way of writing has made him a darling in the American art house community. That same meddling with philosophy, on the other hand, has earned his films the label of pretentious by some audiences. In any case, “I’m Thinking of Ending Things,” distributed by Netflix on Sept. 4, left many viewers scratching their heads as to what they just witnessed.
While the darker, more confounding elements of Kaufman’s adaptation bring the work nowhere close to incompetency, the film is also not a masterpiece. Kaufman loves his words, and some conversations draw on for what seems like ages. Additionally, a poorly structured third act strings together scenes in a haphazard manner that prevents the plot and its characters from flourishing the same way that the film’s central themes hit so poignantly. Nevertheless, among these missteps, “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” is a valiant effort by Kaufman to present existentialism in its broadest, most expansive definition: to feel the weight of a lifetime pass through oneself.
The trouble with film adaptations of novels, especially when the novel is somewhat surreal or complex, is that the film sometimes forgets that it's a film. That is, aesthetic qualities of the film — how visually interesting it appears, its editing, and so on — and its structural elements are not as consistent as the narrative and the characters. In “I’m Thinking of Ending Things,” viewers are treated to a metaphysical conversation between Lucy and her boyfriend as they drive through the snowstorm. These scenes, especially the 13-minute night drive towards home, fail to be as visually interesting as the conversation is thematically interesting. The camera routinely switches from angles within and outside the car, but generally shoots back and forth between Buckley and Plemens’ characters. There’s a lack of dynamic movement — both character movement and character movement — that is both interesting and in line with the tense tone of the script. The view of the brand new swingset in the first car ride, for example, accomplishes this variance. Furthermore, in its exploration of time and its foreshadowing of Jake’s real life, the scenes in the farmhouse are poorly paced. While Jake’s mother (Toni Collette) and father (David Thewlis) deliver respectable performances (Collette’s kookiness becomes somewhat routine after some time), it’s difficult to appreciate the lengthy time spent at the home beyond some pungent moments of dialogue or surrealism.
After the farmhouse, Jake and Lucy go from strange place to strange place, the plot becoming elusive until the audience slowly realizes that Lucy isn’t quite real at all (more on this point later). The film has such a great focus on delivering thematic sucker punches that its overall structure and pacing unfortunately fade into the background. Thankfully, for all the time spent with her character, Buckley, in a weary, sardonic voice, contributes a powerhouse performance. Kaufman has an unfortunate tendency to write female characters as points of character development and exposition for men, but for the time the audience is led to believe her existence, Lucy is the tool through which the film delivers some of its more poignant points. In particular, Buckley’s rendition of Eva H.D.’s poem “Bonedog,” as she stares into the camera, is chilling. It’s also through her that the thematic core of the film is given:
“People like to think of themselves as points moving through time, but I think it’s probably the opposite. We’re stationary and time passes through us. Blowing like cold wind, stealing our heat.”
However, in the third act, Buckley’s character fades away and Kaufman’s idiosyncratic visions begin to flood the narrative without much cohesion in pacing or editing, from the well-lit dance in the school hallways to the very (very) unexpected rendition of Oklahoma’s “Many A New Day,” by Plemens in old-person stage makeup. These moments are grand gestures of artistic expression and Kaufman’s surrealist wit, but were not as meticulously put together as they could’ve been.
While it requires some patience to pull these gems out of the mesh they were placed in and put them together, “I’m Thinking of Ending Things,” forms a beautiful kaleidoscope through which one can see a profound summary of existentialism. The wistful janitor, aging parents, and metronome-like windshield wipers come together as pieces of an existentialist puzzle. To think about the past, present, and future, all at once is as surreal as it is touching, and on an emotional level, Kaufman delivers. Though the psychological thriller ultimately wanders too much for its own good, its risk and commitment to its ideas make it a film worth watching.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By now, you’ve probably seen the pictures: hellish red skies over the San Francisco skyline, street lamps lit in midday to compensate for a sun obscured by ash, hazy and barren cityscapes more fit for an apocalyptic movie than a weekday morning in September. These striking images are also what I woke up to — not just on national news alerts, but also on the social media pages of my friends and family in Oakland, 3,000 miles away from my dorm in the Yard.
“No cap,” one friend wrote to me through Snapchat, “it looks and feels like actual hell out here.” That night, I called my parents to see how they were holding up. Nearly seven months of COVID-19 shelter-in-place meant that they were both accustomed to staying indoors, but the magnitude of the situation was clear. “This is the worst it’s ever been,” my dad told me over the phone. “You picked a good time to leave.”
As a first-year, introducing myself to new people (or, in Harvard-speak, “building my network”) is practically a part-time job, and I’ve performed my introductory tidbit enough times that I can probably say it in my sleep: “Hi I’m Eleanor from Oakland, California yes the actual city yes it is Very Liberal no I do not expect to survive the winter here also did you know that my state is currently on fire hahaha?”
In these exchanges, we offer quirky facts and slight digs at the places that we’re from — maybe offering these concessions in anticipation of judgement, or maybe because we want to shield ourselves from what it actually feels like to miss home. So each time I introduce myself to someone new and do the real-life version of “lol”-ing about the fact that my home is facing its most dangerous fire season ever, I’m not being entirely honest with my new acquaintance nor with myself. What I don’t share is that in being here, in Cambridge, watching my world burn through a phone screen, I feel a disembodied grief. What I don’t share is that I feel a survivor’s guilt for being able to breathe.
Every year for the past four years, Northern California has been devastated by late-autumn wildfires. If you’re lucky, it starts out small — a faint scent of smoke, a subtle thickening of the parched air, a slight bitterness that only the most attuned noses and throats can detect. By the end of the day, the world before you is unrecognizable. Streets are emptied. Birds stop singing. The smoke-sheathed sun covers everything in an eerie orange hue, and the air you breathe is no longer a respite but razor-sharp betrayal to your lungs.
Last year, the year before, and the year before that, the all-consuming effects of fire season persisted for weeks on end. So life went on. We wore masks before it was cool, kept air quality index reports loaded on our phones, rationalized a new normal in whatever way we could. Most of us in Oakland, being out of the direct line of fire, were fortunate enough to emerge each December physically unscathed. But there were some things that we could never get back: senior-year fall sports championships, final homecoming dances, youthful naiveté about the direction that the world was heading. I still remember drafting college essays in my English class in junior year, trying desperately to “imagine myself 20 years into the future” as the Camp Fire obliterated the town of Paradise and the room became steeped in the bitter eulogy of the sky. When I closed my eyes, the bleeding of the sun was still the only thing I could see.
At Harvard, the rest of my life extends infinitely before me. I open my windows to fresh air, savor the blue sky above the Yard, form lifelong friendships, and dream about the possibilities in my future. When I left Oakland, the air quality was stifling; in Cambridge, there is no smoke that clouds my vision, no firestorm that keeps me constrained in visceral fear. I’ve been here for just a month, and I can almost forget what it feels like not to be able to breathe.
Almost.
Because in a world on fire, a world drying and drowning, a world with 10 years left before irreversible climate catastrophe, this is what it means to have the rest of your life open ahead of you: to know that someday, when you need to breathe most, there will be nowhere left to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent an email to students subject-lined, “Checking In.” It was in theory a nice gesture. He’s right: “It is hard to avoid the sense of despair about what is happening around us,” and many of us are “feeling isolated right now.”
But there’s something in the phrase “checking in” that strikes us as a little ironic. To check in with someone is an intimate act, an act of care, an act of personal and singular concern. Though Khurana’s email comes from a well-intentioned place and is in no way incorrect in what it observes, it fails to really embody those intimate qualities of checking in. You do not check in via an email to multiple thousands of students; you reach out individually. And no doubt, part of the profound isolation of this term has been how little of that individual checking-in there actually has been.
So in the spirit of checking in, here’s where a few of us are — not as a board but as intimate pairs of peers. We wrote these sections in teams of two, checking in with each other:
Living On Campus
The communal campus life we once knew is broken. It has to be: shared living quarters and social distancing don’t mix. This version of Harvard’s campus, one designed for isolation, makes it much easier to feel lonely. Without incidental comforts like bumping into friends in the dining hall or en route to physical locations (remember those?), reconstructing a college social life within this new normal requires intention and planning. If you don’t do that, or, understandably, don’t know how to, it can make for a crushingly remote experience.
College can be hard, and unforgivingly busy. What often redeems the experience is rooted in that lost communal life: weekends spent washing the stresses of the week away with friends, or p-set seshes liberally interspersed with laughter and gossip. It’s strange to be in the same place where those joys once took place, at a loss for how to recapitulate those experiences.
But it’s not all bad. Returning to campus after a six-month quarantine has been a blessing for some of us. Being able to unmute on Zoom without hearing screams from younger siblings or simply having the privacy for a phone call has alleviated much stress. The joy of watching the sunset with friends on the Weeks Bridge is immeasurable and was impossible just several weeks ago.
Living Just Outside Campus
Walking through Harvard Yard is tough. Watching people walk into buildings you once called home, but are now barred from, feels a little like living in exile. There’s a community there, but you’re no longer part of it. In a way, walking through campus and being reminded of old memories that seem so distant makes it feel like our time at Harvard has already ended, like we are living some ghostly premonition of our future lives.
Then again, living just off campus is like going to a more traditional college. We cook for ourselves, entertain ourselves, find new communities for ourselves. There’s much to miss about house life, but, then again, there’s something exciting about this new independence. Why settle for Harvard, when you could have Harvard and, say, Somerville? Perhaps it’s time to reconsider residential life at Harvard — to open ourselves up more fully and permanently to the city and communities around us.
Living Far Away From Campus
Oh, what we’d give to see some red bricks and colonial architecture. Here in the same houses we grew up in it’s almost easy for the Harvard experience to feel like a really elaborate dream we had sometime in June. Our social lives are still delivered through Zoom, FaceTime, and probably more TikTok than we care to admit. To some extent it feels like a pause button was hit all those months ago and no one has yet pressed play.
Some of us have coalesced together somewhere in the great beyond outside Cambridge, rented apartments in cities with our friends or partners to get that part of that Harvard dream back in reality. Some of us outside the country haven’t seen any of our American friends at all since March. Maybe we are doing classes or maybe we aren’t. Some of us have chosen to travel: If not Cambridge, why not Rome? But not even an espresso next to the Colosseum can warm us up like the 2 a.m. Lamont Cafe coffee we really need.
None of this is Harvard’s fault and certainly not Khurana’s. But we thought it might be nice to share these places from which we opine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
October 6, 2020, 10:50 a.m. — I sit uncomfortably perched on the top steps of Widener Library, large J.P. Licks coffee in hand, and begin to observe my surroundings.
Golden light speckles the short green grass. It’s a Tuesday, but it feels like a Saturday afternoon: one of those languid mornings in normal times, during which students retreat into their dorms to nurse their hangovers. With the regular stampede of students racing from class to class stripped away, my attention is immediately drawn to the countless staff members who sustain the Harvard organism, clearing pathways, delivering mail, working construction.
My laptop automatically connects to the Harvard Secure Wi-Fi — a strange reminder that this was once somewhere I belonged. But that moment of “connection” is fleeting as I realize there is no bathroom in sight that I would be permitted to use.
While seeking one, a flicker of motion catches my eye. A familiar sight, made foreign by these solitary times: Armed with megaphones and blue-masks, a crowd has gathered at the base of the John Harvard statue.
Navigating a socially distanced sea of crimson and purple shirts as the group disperses, I find myself speaking with Dan Nicolai — the district leader of the Service Employees International Union, which represents over 700 of Harvard’s janitors and 300 security officers. Dressed in an SEIU hoodie, Nicolai explains that today was the union's first day of contract negotiations with Securitas, the company through which Harvard employs its security guards. They are seeking to extend their four-year contract, which expires November 15, by one year. This interim extension would postpone longer-term agreements until next year, allowing a new contract to be developed under more stable conditions.
Nicolai is cautiously hopeful. Harvard hasn’t agreed to anything yet, but they haven’t said no yet either: He’s organized this kick-off rally, hoping to push the cause over the edge.
He introduces me to Doris Landaverde, Luis Toribio, and Helena Bandeira, the three union representatives who will be sitting across from the University at the negotiating table. The issues are personal for them. Landaverde, who made news in the spring for displaying COVID-19 symptoms after disinfecting dormitories, says they are “fighting” for their contract, in order to protect their health and feed their families.
The pandemic gives new and pressing importance to contract negotiations, presenting what former National Labor Relations Board chair Wilma B. Liebman has called the rise of a “whole host of issues” that unions have never had to negotiate before, pertaining to health and safety precautions such as personal protective equipment and social distancing measures. At Harvard, financial woes and a reduced number of students living on campus generates uncertainty and the ever-looming prospect of furloughs.
The effect of instability is perceived ambivalence: The feeling that the University says it shares the workers’ concerns, but doesn’t. At the same time, pre-pandemic interests — secure wages, health care, retirement plans, and paid time off — remain priorities for the union.
These are life or death matters being negotiated for integral members of our community. Many of these campus security officers and janitors are some of the most constant figures in our day-to-day lives, fostering continuity amongst a changing student body. Furthermore, they, perhaps more than anyone, force Harvard to live up to the values it supposedly holds most dear.
The College, for example, believes in striving “toward a more just, fair, and promising world.” The Medical School believes in “alleviating suffering and improving health and well-being.” How the University treats their workers is a crucial demonstration of their ideals. Fair contracts are not an added bonus; they are essential to the University’s moral being.
Moreover, it should not escape our notice that many of these union workers themselves are role models for civil engagement — at the forefront of the pursuit of justice, leading anti-racist labor organizing this summer.
Returning to my nest on Widener steps, I open my computer to an email about negotiations of a different kind.
The Chair of the Undergraduate Council Finance Committee writes, “We just got the budget - a total of $500k for the whole council! I am so excited to say that I was the UC negotiator & set aside $430k for clubs totally during negotiations… Last week, we gave out about $3,200. We normally do about $15,000. apply apply apply! policy guide restrictions will be changing to allow you all more money so please please apply.”
The juxtaposition of life-defining negotiations for staff members and their families and the Undergraduate Council practically begging Club leaders to ask for money — money for events that cannot even be held in person — serves as a disheartening reminder of Harvard’s often misguided priorities: how the ways it distributes its vast resources, subliminally teaches us students opposing values.
After five hours, I pack my bag, toss my coffee cup, and prepare for my departure. These few hours have reminded me how central Harvard’s campus is to communal life. The John Harvard alone statue critically facilitates important connections between the students, staff, and local community members. The statue may feel like an empty symbol for those of us studying from afar, but for custodial staff it is a place of activism, a place of their livelihood.
Even more, my return to the Yard illuminates that achieving the kind of world we aspire towards begins with manifesting these ideals within our own community.
I do not need student organizations, funded by the University, to buy me a free Patagonia nor do I need them to send me food via Uber eats. I need the University to put its money where its mouth is, to teach me about justice by demonstrating that it is possible, to show that it values the health and well-being of all of its community members equally — to stop falling short of this.

The man on the phone was aggressively blasé, as I suppose is wont for many millennials. But after hearing dozens of answering recordings, I began to feel like a machine myself, an automaton mechanically entering phone numbers and clicking buttons on a screen. I craved the sound of breathing; I was grateful even for hostility, because it meant a human was on the other side.
The man confirmed that he supported the candidate I was phone banking for, but his tone suggested he couldn't care less whether this person won. He hesitated before telling me, “Just so you know, I think you’re wasting your time. Work at a food bank, or a homeless shelter, or tutor some underprivileged kids or something.” Then he hung up.
I didn’t get a chance to respond, and I don’t know what I would have said had he stayed on to hear my response.
Feeling unsettled, I played out the argument in my shower later that evening. (Don’t lie — you’ve done this at least once.) The careless way he listed the things I ostensibly should be doing suggested he himself hadn’t done any of them. I thought it was peak American male arrogance to be completely politically disengaged but feel comfortable expressing derision at someone else’s civic efforts.
Then for a while, I thought he might be right. At a food bank I could be completely confident that my efforts were fruitful: My labor would translate directly to more full bellies. If a candidate I spent hundreds of hours volunteering for lost, that time was arguably completely wasted.
Youth voter turnout — or rather, the lack thereof — is routinely attributed to young people’s indolence and apathy, not any specific ideology. But the man on the phone was the first of many young-ish people I spoke with this summer who expressed the belief that voting is not only ineffective but actively harmful, a charade that saps energy from radical and more material change. Cleaning steam from the mirror, I considered this argument.
From the well-intentioned pleas of the Harvard Votes Challenge to new features of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, over the past few months we have been bombarded with a deafening, one-note urge to vote. But in this final voting sprint, I want to take a step back and really address criticisms of electoral politics.
First, and most importantly, the anti-voting people I spoke with always assumed a zero-sum relationship between voting or campaigning and other forms of engagement. But this is a false trade-off: Personally, I’ve found time to vote and campaign, protest and tutor; many of the folks I campaigned with are similarly engaged across the board.
More broadly, this view of electoral politics as a kind of political dead-end dismisses the way voting often acts as the gateway to deeper civic engagement. As my friends vote for the first time, I have also witnessed them realize a greater political attentiveness and a desire to get involved in demonstrations, local organizations, and campaigns.
Are there people whose only engagement with politics is the ballot they cast every four years in the presidential election? Absolutely. But we should encourage those people to participate more, not tell them that voting is pointless.
Another argument that I heard often, especially from leftists, was that voting upholds oppressive systems, namely carceral capitalism, settler-colonialism, and the patriarchy.
Those systems undeniably exist, and I’m not so naive to think that voting could necessarily dismantle them. But voting in a system is not an endorsement of the system, especially if one is also active outside the system. I can call for prison abolition at a protest and vote for a candidate who at least opposes private prisons over one who doesn’t.
Anti-capitalists still purchase food through a capitalist market system. Their solution is not to starve: It is to try to obtain food in the least harmful way — be it vegetarianism, a co-op, sustainable farming — while protesting capitalism through direct action. Even if there is no ethical consumption, we consume in the best way we can while pushing for a new, more ethical system.
The same should be true of voting. We can take to the streets, and create self-sufficient communities, but in the interim we have an obligation to make things just a little bit better by voting. The fact that so many are disenfranchised is even more reason to vote, to amplify a political voice that is unjustly muted. In other words, resistance shouldn’t be limited to the ballot box, but it shouldn’t have to reject the ballot box as an important mechanism of change either.
I want to be absolutely clear: This is not a call to vote for Joe Biden, or to vote blue no matter who, or to use harm reduction as a blanket political calculus. There are people for whom voting is personally traumatic; for example, some sexual assault survivors feel alienated in a presidential election where the two major candidates are accused of sexual misconduct. I am not suggesting that we create a political culture that shames people who choose not to vote.
But dogmatic condemnations of all electoral politics engender apathy in the privileged, and convince people that their passivity is radical. We cannot encourage people to stop voting or campaigning right now with the hope that they choose to engage in more nebulous forms of making change.
Instead, we should move towards a vision of political engagement that includes the ballot box and calls for revolution and abolition, a recognition of short term gains that does not abandon long term imagination.

Seventeen students pitched their ideas to promote Arctic sustainability Friday at the 2020 Arctic Innovation Lab, co-organized by the Arctic Initiative at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center.
Conducted in partnership with the Luleå University of Technology, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and the Iceland School of Energy at Reykjavík University, among other organizations, the Innovation Lab invited individuals to think creatively about Arctic sustainability. The Lab serves as the final project for a Kennedy School course titled “IGA-671: Policy and Social Innovations for the Changing Arctic,” taught by Arctic Initiative co-founder and Kennedy School lecturer Halla H. Logadóttir.
Friday’s event, held via Zoom, began with opening remarks from Logadóttir. She underscored how climate change has heightened the need for innovative solutions in the Arctic.
“The Arctic region is dramatically changing. It is the region that is warming at least twice as fast as the rest of the globe, and that brings multiple consequences, new problems, new risks,” she said.
U.S. Ambassador to Sweden and PayPal co-founder Kenneth A. Howery, who served as one of ten judges for the event, encouraged attendees to foster the entrepreneurial values of tenacity and creativity in their problem-solving.
“As prospective policy makers, I would challenge you to look for new and better ways to solve old problems,” Howery said. “Sweden’s high north is full of people looking for opportunities where others don’t, and even some who are prepared to fully embrace the unknowns of the Arctic’s shifting environment.”
The participants then had the opportunity to pitch their ideas to the judges for two minutes each. During the pitches, the ten judges — including former Lieutenant Governor of Alaska Louis “Mead” Treadwell II, Head of Greenland’s Secretariat Katti Frederiksen, and Head of Social Entrepreneurship at the Harvard Innovation Labs Rebekah H. Emanuel — evaluated the presentations.
Pitches addressed Arctic sustainability through approaches including culinary experimentation, geoengineering, and infrastructural deficit.
Allison M. Agsten, a Kennedy School student and one of the participants, emphasized the need for increased indigenous media representation in her pitch.
“Journalists often treat the region as an uninhabited expanse when in fact four million people live there, 10 percent of whom are native to the region,” Agsten wrote in a message to The Crimson.
While the judges deliberated following the presentations, attendees were randomly sorted into seventeen breakout rooms, each of which contained one participant. These breakout rooms served as an opportunity for attendees to ask questions and learn more about participants’ pitches.
The judges then returned to the main session to introduce the winners. The top five participants included Morgan Bell, who presented on “sustainable seaweed” in the Arctic, Maatalii Okalik, whose project focused on an “Inuit strategy of conservation,” and Taylor Lam, who worked on a “common operational picture” for the Arctic. Elsennguaq Silassen, who presented on the decolonization of Greenland, and Rosa-Máren Magga, who spoke about the preservation of language, were also among the judges’ top picks.
In an interview after the event, Logadóttir called attention to the importance of collaborative problem-solving in promoting long-term sustainability in the Arctic.
“You don’t do anything alone in this space,” she said. “Working in this space is collaborating with others toward solutions and seeing good projects come alive and make a difference.”
The 2020 Arctic Innovation Lab marks the program’s fourth year. Select pitches will be supported for further development.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Women+ of Color Project held a three-day conference beginning Oct. 10 for women from underrepresented backgrounds studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics who hope to pursue graduate school.
Geared towards improving graduate school applications, the conference largely focused on understanding and crafting components of the application like statements of purpose and recommendation letters. Undergraduate mentees gleaned advice from a team of volunteers that included Harvard post-doctoral researchers and faculty.
Conference attendees, hailing from colleges near and far, consisted of two groups, active and non-active participants. Out of roughly 120 applicants, 50 were selected to be active participants and given the opportunity to interact with presenters and receive one-on-one mentoring for their applications. Non-active participants were invited to listen in on workshop sessions.
LaNell A. Williams, a Harvard graduate student studying physics, started the Women+ of Color Project in July 2019 after feeling frustrated about being one of the few black women in her field. Of more than 55,000 physics doctorates currently held, fewer than 100 have been awarded to black women, according to the WOCP website.
“It started because I was tired of being the [one of the few] black women in physics in my department,” Williams said. “Being one of the few black women in every space I'm in, it's just something that's kind of exhausting and unfortunate and very frustrating.”
The WOCP hosted a similar conference last October, offering 20 undergraduates the opportunity to participate in an analogous program on campus.
This year, the workshops took place online — a change that impacted the experience both positively and negatively, according to Williams. While the move to a virtual conference limited some programming, like laboratory tours, Williams said the ability to expand access offered a major advantage.
“I think in a way, the virtual format has given us the ability to reach more students. So last year, we were able to only accommodate 20 and this year, we could accommodate 50,” Williams said.
The WOCP aims to create a welcoming atmosphere and to show women of color that they do have a place in male-dominated STEM fields, according to workshop organizer Danita Douglas.
“My hope is that by seeing people like my fellow committee members and I and hearing our stories, other women will see themselves too and believe that they are a valued part of the STEM community,” Douglas wrote in an email.
Williams agreed with Douglas, adding that the WOCP aims to be a voice telling women of color in STEM they can succeed despite a history of exclusion.
“I know for sure, there’s a pool of women of color that are not being tapped into who already have the credentials, who already have the potential to get into the places that they want but are always being told no,” Williams said. “We want to be a voice that’s telling them yes and also giving them the tools to do so.”
Rodrigo A. Bravo, an organizer for the WOCP workshops and physics PhD student at Harvard, wrote in an email that initiatives like the WOCP are crucial for calling attention to underrepresented women of color in STEM, especially in the wake of recent racial justice movements.
“As we recognize the importance of changing the face of academia in a time of crippling racial injustice, our project’s goal is to turn this ship around by targeting a very specific traditionally overlooked demographic: women+ of color interested in pursuing graduate school in STEM fields,” Bravo wrote. “We want to tell them that they’re welcomed and that their hard work is enough to reach their dreams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael J. Cima — a materials science and engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — explained where the human body stores excess fluid during kidney failure and introduced the preliminary design for a sensor that measures this excess fluid at an event hosted by the student-run Kidney Disease Screening and Awareness Program Friday.
“We discovered that there is a method that can quantify the absolute amount of fluid, but we also discovered where that water actually was,” Cima said.
Patients with kidney disease may need to undergo hemodialysis, where a machine filters waste and fluids from the body as healthy kidneys normally would. Physicians currently do not have a precise and non-invasive method for measuring a patient’s fluid levels and determining how much fluid needs to be removed during hemodialysis.
A new bedside nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometer sensor — which Cima and his colleagues designed and are in the process of testing — might be the solution, according to Cima. His goal is to use this device to quantitatively distinguish between fluid-overloaded and healthy patients.
One of the most surprising discoveries from his research, Cima said, was that the excess bodily fluid is mainly stored in the spaces between skeletal muscle cells, instead of underneath the skin.
“I asked a lot of physicians, ‘Where is the excess fluid?,’ and I got all kinds of answers,” Cima said. “Probably the most common response I got was, ‘The excess fluid is underneath the skin.’”
While Cima’s device currently measures fluid underneath the skin, he said he plans to refine his sensor to measure the large quantities of fluid in regions of muscle.
“We discovered something about human physiology that no one knew,” he said. “In the next study, we have to design a sensor. Instead of doing it in that subcutaneous space, we actually just do it in the muscle.”
The talk took place as part of KDSAP’s 2020 Speaker Series. KDSAP’s mission is to raise awareness about kidney disease and provide free kidney screenings to underserved communities, such as cultural centers and homeless shelters. But the coronavirus shutdown has presented an obstacle for the organization, according to Nhu H. Dang ’21, president of Harvard’s KDSAP chapter.
“It actually affected us a lot because we’re a direct public service group, and our main mission is to go out in the community and provide health care. So we can’t really hold our screenings anymore,” Dang said. “In March, it was very chaotic because we had no idea how we were going to continue KDSAP. But I think the motivation to continue it is that there’s evidence that the kidney disease patients have a higher risk of getting COVID.”
Dang added that KDSAP has been making efforts to transition its programming to accommodate remote requirements and to continue conversations about kidney disease. These initiatives include contacting representatives about “policies that disproportionately affect kidney disease patients,” according to Dang.
“Health disparities are just so wide and so relevant to the time that we’re living in,” Dang said. “It’s something that everyone should know about because if it doesn’t affect you, it will affect your neighbor. Everyone can contribute to alleviate health disparities by first educating themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Dean of Students Office released move-out plans to students living on campus in an email Friday, an endeavor the administration is hoping will be much smoother and well-planned than the hectic send-off students faced in the spring.
Students departing campus will need to move out prior to Thanksgiving break and will remain at home during reading period and finals. A successful move-out would affirm DSO administrators’ confidence in students’ ability to prevent an outbreak on campus, DSO administrators said in an Oct. 2 interview.
“Houses and dorms close at 5:00pm on Sunday, November 22 for the fall term,” the email announcement read. “You should plan to move all belongings out of your suite no later than this date, though you are welcome to move off campus earlier.”
The email provided information regarding room key drop-offs, as well as a checklist for students to follow to ready their suite for moving out. The move-out process will also utilize a “contactless checkout,” according to the email.
“You will leave your key in a designated key-drop location and complete a form on the Residential Portal when you leave campus,” the email stated.
The reminder to students follows the plan set out by the University in July, which allowed for freshmen and select upperclassmen to return to campus. Select upperclassmen could apply to stay in residence, provided they meet specific criteria.
Friday’s email also stated that a limited group of students would be allowed to stay on campus through the end of the term or even through winter break. More information regarding the “eligibility and application process” will be released to students by Oct. 19.
In the spring, the College offered a similar opportunity to a select group of students who successfully petitioned to stay on campus after the de-densification period and throughout the summer.
Departing from its spring decision, however, the College will neither provide storage nor coordinate on-campus pick-up and drop-off for students’ belongings, according to the email.
In the spring, the College directly assisted with students’ moving and storage plans by offering a $200 grant to students on financial aid to help cover costs. With most students taking classes remotely this semester, the College provided an additional $175 subsidy to help defray the cost of storage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council announced its budget for the 2020-21 academic year, totaling $500,000, in a general meeting Sunday.
The money will go to funding club events and activities throughout the year as well as the individual initiatives run by the Council.
“It was a very good week for the treasury,” Council Treasurer and Adams House representative Noah A. Harris ’22 said during the meeting. “We got our budget and it is 500,000 dollars, when we expected it to be about half that.”
The Crimson previously reported that an internal email from the UC Finance Committee warned the Council’s budget may be potentially cut in half this year due to an unprecedented number of College students who waived the Student Activities Fee.
The fee, which is $200, pays for multiple student organizations, including the Council.
“That’s huge for us going forward, to be able to function at full capacity — that’s going to be great,” Harris said.
The Council also considered legislation to try to encourage students to vote in this year’s presidential election by making Election Day a University holiday.
The legislation is sponsored by Currier House representative Jack M. Swanson ’22, Adams House representative Esther J. Xiang ’23, Leverett House representative John E. “Jake” Leary III ’22, Kirkland House representative Angus W. Woods ’21, Cabot House representative Brooke L. Livingston ’23, and Elm Yard representative Emily M. “Emmy” Cho ’24, a Crimson News comper.
The legislation called for the passing of an official UC statement and petition asking that Election Day be made a University holiday and publicizing the statement throughout the student body.
“The 2020 election is one of unprecedented importance. Yet, folks all across the United States report difficulty voting, volunteering and getting engaged because of their jobs or school. Young people in particular vote at alarmingly low rates,” the legislation read.
The legislation also cited peer institutions, such as Brown University, that have designated Election Day as a University holiday.
In 2016, Harvard College had a 57.8 percent voter turnout rate. In recent months, organizations such as the Harvard Votes Challenge have aimed to get turnout rate to 100 percent.
“As citizens, no single action is more important than exercising our right to vote,” the legislation read. “We call on Harvard to live up to their mission and let its students, faculty and staff participate in this critical election.”
It was passed by a vote of 37-0-0.
“This is essentially calling for the UC to publicize via tier 1 that we sign a petition to make election a Harvard University holiday,” Cho said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just three weeks before Election Day, experts say much is at stake for Harvard in the outcome of the contest between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a Sept. 25 interview with The Crimson that he would not speculate on the outcome of the election and that the University will always try to “work cooperatively with the government, regardless of who is in power.”
But in recent months, the relationship between Harvard and Trump has been more contentious than cooperative.
In April, Trump said that Harvard would have to “pay back” the nearly $9 million it was allocated in the CARES Act, the largest economic stimulus package in American history. Soon after his criticism, Harvard announced that it would not “seek or accept” the funds to which it was entitled.
In July, shortly after Harvard announced its fall reopening plan, Trump called it "ridiculous" and said University administrators “ought to be ashamed of themselves” for taking the easy way out. Harvard did not change its plans.
That same day, Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology sued Trump’s Department of Homeland Security over its rule to ban international students from the country if their courses were online only. A week later, DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rescinded the rule.
In September, the University also fired back at the Department of Education on the issue of Title IX after the DOE released new federal guidelines and sparred with the Department of Justice in the race-conscious admissions appeal from the Students for Fair Admissions.
David A. Hopkins ’99, an associate professor of political science at Boston College, said the conflicts between Harvard and Trump “are part of a larger trend and a larger pattern.”
“It’s not just about Trump as an individual president, but it’s about the Republican Party as a party,” Hopkins said. “The elite institutions of higher education are seen as liberal-dominated and as part of the political opposition.”
To Hopkins, that dynamic has clear implications for the upcoming election.
“A Democratic victory is going to mean people who are much more sympathetic to higher education than a Republican victory,” he said.
Frederick M. Hess, the director of Education Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, made a similar assessment of the upcoming election.
“Institutions which eagerly embrace one political party or one ideology tend to do very well when that party is in power and tend to have a very difficult relationship with the other party when it’s in power,” he said. “Institutions like Harvard have both institutionally and culturally made clear that they have very strong preferences in our ideological and political debates, which means they have a big stake in the outcome.”
In a survey by The Crimson in March, nearly 80 percent of Harvard’s faculty self-identified as very liberal or liberal, and a plurality supported Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren (D-Mass.) in the presidential primaries.
Beyond politics, a president and his administration wield significant power and influence over the day-to-day workings of higher education.
Terry W. Hartle, the senior vice president for government relations at the American Council on Education, said the industry is “inextricably bound up” with the federal government, which will provide colleges and universities with about $100 billion in financial aid and $40 billion in research grants in 2020 alone.
“Those two things taken together add up to a very substantial part of our enterprise, particularly for research universities like Harvard,” Hartle said. “The activities that the institutions engage in wouldn’t look anything like they do without substantial support of the federal government.”
Hopkins also noted the ability of a presidential administration to impact campuses with its policies on issues, like immigration and Title IX, and its response to national and international circumstances, like the coronavirus pandemic.
Thomas D. Parker ’64, a fellow at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, wrote in an email to The Crimson that if Trump is reelected, the University will remain “a target.”
“Harvard, because of its preeminence in the field of higher education, will continue to be a primary target,” Parker wrote. “Soon the General Counsel’s office will be even bigger than the Office of University Advancement.”
With the stakes of the election high for both Harvard and the nation, Bacow urged affiliates to the polls in an email on Oct. 7.
“Each of us, whether eligible to vote or not, has a responsibility to affirm and uphold the ideals of democracy,” Bacow wrote. “The Harvard we have come to know and love, to challenge and change, is a uniquely American institution.”
“Our strength depends, in many ways, on the strength of the union, and we must do our part to ensure that every person’s voice is heard,” he added. “If you are eligible, please register and vote.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 300 Harvard Law School students and affiliates signed an online petition calling on the school to provide a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing the appointment of a new Supreme Court Justice before Inauguration Day.
The petition is sponsored by the People’s Parity Project — a law student organization that aims to reform the legal profession — and has been signed by notable alumni including Former Senator Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), and Professor Emeritus Laurence H. Tribe ’62.
Following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September, President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. The nomination — which took place only weeks before this November’s federal election — drew immediate criticism from several members of the Law School faculty, including Tribe.
The authors of the petition claim U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who supports Barrett’s nomination, contradicted his 2016 stance on filling Court vacancies during presidential election years. Four years ago, McConnell opposed former U.S. President Barack Obama’s attempt to fill a Supreme Court vacancy left by former Justice Antonin Scalia in March 2016.
“When Justice Antonin Scalia died nine months before the election, McConnell refused to give Judge Merrick Garland a hearing, citing the impending election,” the petition reads. “There, the election was months out; here, the election has already begun.”
Daniel S. Medwed, a Law School graduate and former Visiting Professor of Law, said he shares the petitioners’ concerns about Coney Barrett’s nomination. He claimed the reversal of the Republican Party’s stance from 2016 has made him “feel as though the process is illegitimate and that we shouldn’t abide by it.”
Third-year Harvard Law student Brendan Schneiderman, an author of the petition, said a Supreme Court nomination before the next president is inaugurated will create a conservative majority on the Court that may jeopardize legislation Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to support if elected President in November.
“It’s concerning from a democratic perspective because we’re in the midst of an election right now,” he said. “I think a lot of folks on campus and in the Harvard community, generally, were feeling the same kind of angst and frustration and disappointment that this, you know, travesty of a confirmation was going to go forward.”
Schneiderman also noted that Law School administrators sent emails to students about honoring Justice Ginsburg’s legacy and values. Still, members of the People’s Parity Project felt the school needed to specifically oppose Barrett’s confirmation.
“It was an underwhelming message, I think when, when it was coupled with a complete silence about what was going on in the Senate,” he said.
The petition argues that if the Law School demands the Senate to keep Ginsburg’s seat open until after Inauguration Day, other institutions would follow with similar demands. It also states the Law School’s opposition to the nomination would assure students and affiliates of its commitment to fairness.
“If the Law School cares about the legitimacy of the Court, if it wants its students to believe in the rule of law and advocate for equal justice, if Dean Manning truly hopes that we ‘honor’ and ‘celebrate’ the values that Justice Ginsburg embodied, then we ask: how can the Law School be silent now?” the petition reads.
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the Law School serves students, staff, alumni, and faculty with a diverse array of viewpoints and opinions.
“Rather than seeking to express a view for the institution as a whole, the Law School embraces the pluralism of our community and supports its members in their right to express their own views,” he wrote.
Medwed, however, said he feels it is important for the Law School to denounce the nomination due to leading law schools’ influence over the legal system.
“Harvard Law School, of course, is one of the most elite institutions in the country, and for the institution to say this process is not appropriate — this is not how it should work, this is not how it has worked — I think would be potentially meaningful,” Medwed said.
“Would it stop the ball rolling? Probably not, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in an interview Friday that Harvard affiliates’ adherence to health protocols thus far “bodes well” for welcoming “potentially even more students” back to campus in the spring.
While the FAS originally planned to bring up to 40 percent of students — the entire freshman class and students who face challenges learning at home — back in residence this fall, only 25 percent of students decided to return to campus. Students on campus must follow strict safety protocols to prevent COVID-19 infections, including frequent testing and limited social interaction.
FAS plans to announce which students will be allowed on campus during the spring semester in early December, Harvard administrators announced in a July email. Students facing challenging home environments will still be invited back, and FAS plans to prioritize bringing seniors back to campus if possible.
Gay said Friday that the announcement is still planned for early December, and spring plans will depend on evolving factors such as the status of the virus and public health regulations.
She noted, however, that Harvard has been successful in controlling infection thus far and lauded a “remarkable level of commitment” on the part of students, faculty, and staff in adhering to pandemic safety protocols.
“All of that bodes well for our ability to continue to welcome students, and potentially even more students, back to campus in the spring,” she said.
Gay added that she hopes FAS will be able to welcome all students back to campus in fall 2021.
“We’re hoping that we’re going to be in a position to welcome everyone back to campus next fall and do our best to maintain the dynamic academic program that we pride ourselves on and also sustain our commitment to residential liberal arts,” she said.
Infection rates on campus remain relatively low, with five new positive cases — none among undergraduates — reported from Oct. 5 to 11, out of 16,531 tests. Still, the College sent three freshmen home in early October for hosting a small party the previous month.
While more total students enrolled in the fall semester than FAS projected, roughly 20 percent of undergraduates took a leave of absence this semester; 340 incoming freshmen deferred enrollment, a sharp increase from the usual rate of 80 to 110 freshmen.
Gay said it was “hard to say at this point” how the return of those students would affect FAS’s academic programs and housing plans in future semesters.
“It’s possible that a lot of students will seek to matriculate or to return from leaves of absence at the same time next year, and that’s going to create challenges around housing on campus,” Gay said. “We will have to build that into our planning as we learn more — both about the course of the virus and its implications for what we’re able to do on campus, as well as what we learn about students’ decisions for next year.”
She declined to comment on whether the College or the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is considering admitting fewer students in coming years to account for a potential housing shortage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Department of Justice sued Yale University Thursday over charges of racial discrimination against Asian American and white applicants in its admissions process.
The Justice Department determined in mid-August that Yale violated civil rights law by using race as a “determinative factor” in its admissions process, alleging it disadvantaged Asian American and white applicants. At the time, the Justice Department demanded Yale change its admissions procedures in a press release, threatening to sue unless Yale complied.
Federal authorities are also investigating Harvard’s admissions process — an effort that was ongoing through at least last December.
Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division explained the Justice Department’s reasoning in a press release announcing the lawsuit.
“All persons who apply for admission to colleges and universities should expect and know that they will be judged by their character, talents, and achievements and not the color of their skin,” said Dreiband in the release. “To do otherwise is to permit our institutions to foster stereotypes, bitterness, and division.”
Yale University President Peter Salovey defended the University’s admissions process in a statement Thursday, rejecting the Justice Department’s claims of discrimination.
“Our admissions practices are completely fair and lawful. Yale’s admissions policies will not change as a result of the filing of this baseless lawsuit,” Salovey wrote in the statement. “We look forward to defending these policies in court.”
Indiana University law professor Kevin D. Brown said he believes the Justice Department sued Yale because it wants to argue against affirmative action before the Supreme Court.
“Clearly what the plaintiffs are counting on is getting this up to the Supreme Court where, with a new Supreme Court now, it is a much more hostile Supreme Court with respect to affirmative action,” Brown said. “It’s probably right to believe that with the addition of [Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett] on the Supreme Court, you’ll have a solid person majority against affirmative action.”
Brown added that he believes President Donald J. Trump’s nomination of Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court could very well result in the end of that policy, which has been in place since the 1960s and has survived multiple challenges at the highest level.
“If Amy Coney Barrett is, in fact, confirmed — unless there’s an effort to pack the court — it is likely that affirmative action will fall over the next two to three years,” Brown said.
University of New Mexico law professor Vinay Harpalani also said he thinks federal prosecutors had ambitions beyond just forcing Yale to change its admissions procedures.
“I think more broadly, the Trump administration’s goal here is just to kind of send a public message to universities, to conservative interests that want to end affirmative action,” Harpalani said.
The Justice Department has also supported anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in its ongoing lawsuit arguing that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian American applicants in its admissions program. The Department submitted an amicus brief in February calling for the First Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn a District Court ruling in Harvard’s favor, and Dreiband presented against Harvard’s policies last month during oral arguments in the appeals process.
University of Maryland American Studies professor Janelle S. Wong wrote in an emailed statement that the lawsuit is an attempt to undermine affirmative action. Wong — who used to serve on the national board for the Association for Asian American Studies — added that she believes prosecutors did not genuinely intend to promote equality for Asian Americans as a whole.
“The Yale complaint also imposes a very strange definition of ‘Asian American.’ It states explicitly that for the purposes of the lawsuit, the Asian American category excludes Southeast Asian groups such as Cambodians and Hmong students,” Wong wrote. “Hence, the Trump DOJ is manufacturing their own definition of our communities to suit their political agenda.”
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those criticisms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions challenged Harvard representatives in oral arguments before the First Circuit Court of Appeals last month.
While legal experts believe the Court will not reach a decision for several months, that time period could coincide with both a new U.S. President and a new Supreme Court justice. President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett to the bench last month. While Coney Barrett has not previously ruled on race-conscious admissions, experts say her ascension could threaten precedents supporting affirmative action.
District Court judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled last fall that Harvard does not intentionally discriminate against Asian American applicants, a decision SFFA appealed in February. SFFA and Harvard presented oral arguments last month, during which the Department of Justice and NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund testified for the two sides.
Here’s what experts say those arguments mean, both for the future of SFFA’s suit and for race-conscious admissions across the country.
Scholars say SFFA has tried to paint alleged implicit bias against Asian Americans in Harvard’s admissions process as a form of intentional discrimination, particularly in its most recent oral argument.
“SFFA really emphasized the racial stereotyping and implicit bias of Asian Americans and actually argued, interestingly, that that’s a form of intentional discrimination, which is unusual. Usually you think of implicit bias as unintentional,” said University of New Mexico law professor Vinay Harpalani. “It’s a way to latch on the appeal and go further to the First Circuit, potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court, and kind of use this theory to carry along the challenge to affirmative action.”
Harpalani also pointed out the distinction between policies that discriminate against Asian Americans and affirmative action in service of racial diversity.
“It’s almost like their whole case is about taking this idea of discrimination against Asian Americans, vis-a-vis white Americans, he said. “They’re trying to promote that to actually challenge Grutter [v. Bollinger], to challenge race-conscious admissions to benefit African Americans and Latinos — which is a separate thing.”
Mitchell J. Chang, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles, said SFFA’s “smoking gun” would show Asian American plaintiffs are being penalized in their qualitative measures.
“I think that the question of whether or not Asian Americans are being discriminated against still stands, but how you frame it is the problem I have with SFFA,” Chang said. “They’re framing it as a result of race-conscious admissions that’s supposed to benefit African Americans and other disadvantaged groups.”
“If this lawsuit is really in the interest of its Asian American plaintiffs, then why aren’t we addressing the advantages that white applicants are having?” he added.
Harvard, by contrast, has relied on decades of case law supporting race-conscious admissions. Peter F. Lake ’81, a Stetson University law professor, said such precedents are central to the University’s case before the First Circuit.
“‘This isn’t the time to overrule Fisher v. Texas, nor is it the right or job of a district or circuit to do that,’” he said, describing Harvard’s stance. “Harvard has been put through the test and has demonstrated that it has succeeded in a very thoughtful opinion.”
The timeline for the Circuit Court’s ruling remains unpredictable. Whenever that ruling comes down, though, experts said the losing side will likely again appeal the decision.
“It’s hard for me to see the First Circuit ruling in favor of SFFA,” Harpalani said, citing the three appellate judges assigned to the case. “Judges Lynch, Juan Torruella, and Howard, they’re two Republican appointees and one Democratic appointee — one Reagan appointee, one Bush appointee, and one Clinton appointee. But that doesn’t really mean much at this level.”
Lake said he believes previous race discrimination cases in university admissions could hint at the future of SFFA’s suit.
“It wouldn’t surprise me to see the Circuit test some noncongruence with the District and remand the case for further proceedings or some kind of further judicial activity before that would be potentially ripe for final decision,” said Lake. “That’s been kind of the way these cases have gone in the past.”
SFFA has sued several universities over their admissions policies, meaning circuit courts could rule differently on the matter within the coming months. Lake said the First Circuit will have to be careful when timing its decision relative to the college application cycle.
“It’d be a heck of a thing to get a decision from the First Circuit in May that tells you what you did in April, in March was unlawful,” said Lake. “If that’s where we’re headed, I think we’d want to know that ahead of the admission season.”
“I would think the First Circuit will come out with an opinion in the spring some time,” Harpalani said.
Despite the case’s unclear path forward, Lake said he believes anti-affirmative action advocates should not be overly optimistic about SFFA’s appeal, even given Coney Barrett’s nomination.
“People will believe that with new justices, there may be a chance to overrule precedent. But the Supreme Court’s credibility in a lot of ways — as well as its rule on American society — is bent on respecting stare decisis,” Lake said. “It doesn’t mean that you don’t overrule, because they have and they will in the future, but that’s a pretty somber choice.”
Harpalani, however, said race-conscious policies are safest if the Court does not take up any of SFFA’s challenges.
“The best chance for affirmative action to survive is if the Supreme Court does not grant cert,” Harpalani said. “If [the Trump administration] really wants to strike down affirmative action now, they’ll grant cert and the justices are there to do it.”
Several experts said they believe the Department of Justice’s support for SFFA in the lawsuit and its concurrent investigations into race-based admissions at other universities have political motives.
Chang cited the Justice Department’s decision to sue Yale over its allegedly discriminatory admissions policies last week, for example.
“This was the first time [the DOJ] came out so strongly against a particular institution and basically told them to suspend it,” Chang said. “It’s an administration that is trying to signal their stance on race-consciousness leading into the elections.”
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
University of Southern California education professor Tatiana Melguizo said she worries an end to affirmative action nationwide would mirror the same negative effects that Black and Latino students have faced in California since the state’s 1996 ban of the practice.
“As soon as a Proposition 209 stopped, you could see a substantial decrease in the acceptance of Latinos and African Americans,” Melguizo said. “That had a snowball effect because the students were receiving some sort of signal that they were not welcome.”
Melguizo cited economic studies Harvard presented against SFFA in its court cas,e which demonstrated the role of affirmative action in student outcomes.
“These economists estimated the loss in earnings for the Latino population is in the millions of dollars because students could not get admission and then went to less-selective institutions,” Melguizo said.
Chang also referenced the drop in numbers of African American and Latino students in California following the removal of race-conscious admissions practices.
“SFFA seemed to have conceded that point because the empirical evidence there is just overwhelming,” Chang said. ‘There is a really strong relationship and strong added value to attending a more racially diverse campus.”
Describing this case as the biggest race discrimination lawsuit in higher education in recent years, Lake said he believes the implications of the case will extend far beyond Harvard’s admissions program.
“International audiences are watching this as well because Harvard is a global presence,” Lake said. “The implications for this case resonate globally.”
Correction: October 13, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mitchell J. Chang served as an expert witness for SFFA in a suit it brought against the University of North Carolina. In fact, he served as an expert witness for UNC.

Though Harvard’s current dining options are certainly not the worst we’ve seen (looking at you NYU), you don’t want COVID-19 turning mealtime into yet another monotonous routine, so here are some ways to spice up dhall food. By the way, if you’re learning remotely and finding yourself totally inept in the kitchen, these tips are for you too!
You have a fridge for a reason.
Take advantage of the MicroFridge Harvard has provided to everyone free of charge for the fall semester. The 15-minute breaks between classes do not leave much time to consume a full meal, unless you want to be the person eating an entire plate of spaghetti with sauce dripping down your chin in lecture. It’s a better idea to keep some fresh fruit, yogurt, vegetables and hummus, lunchables if you want to throw it back to 4th grade (they’re sold at Broadway Market), and other snack items of your choosing on hand in the fridge. If you’re not sick of sandwiches already, stock up on bread, deli meats, and toppings of your choosing.
You also have a microwave.
It’s Friday, you’re feeling confident, and you’re ready to finally try your hand at making a microwave mug meal. A quick Google search will give you a ton of ideas, including instant mac and cheese, microwave mug pizza, a burrito in a mug, and even chocolate cake if you’ve fully embraced eating dessert for lunch.
Join our Trader Joe’s cult.
Unseasoned food is the enemy. An extra sprinkle of black pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, or salt goes a long way. But if you want to move on from the basics, use your “time to experience sunshine so I don’t get seasonal depression” walk to go to Trader Joe’s. Pick up the Everything But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend, a cult classic; I’ve yet to find something this doesn’t amp up the flavor of. If Top Ramen isn’t hitting the spot anymore after eating it seven days in a row, try the Mushroom and Company Multipurpose Umami Seasoning Blend or grab some soy sauce. If you’re trying to avoid overdosing on sodium, you can stick to salt-free spice blends that don’t sacrifice taste, like the 21 Seasoning Salute.
Or, if the walk is just too far...
Don’t feel like moving your legs after a day of literally sitting? Walgreens has a smaller selection of spices, but they have all the essential hot sauces: Sriracha, Cholula, Tapatio, Frank’s Red Hot, Valentina — and Tabasco too if you lack standards and class. If your favorite isn’t on this list, try HMart just one T stop away.
Everything on this list has been fairly healthy, but let’s be real: This semester has been rough, or at least more chaotic than usual, to say the least, and sometimes all you want to do is stress-eat your feelings. But instead of just devouring everything in your room, it might be more satisfying to break out of routine and treat yourself. So, worst comes to worst, ditch the bagged meals in your dorm room for some J.P. Licks or L.A. Burdick’s hot chocolate.

Dear Freshmen,
Under any circumstance, coming to college is daunting, and adding a pandemic to the mix just makes it all the more challenging. So take it to heart that making mistakes and “failing” (whatever that may mean) are a part of the life experience, and certainly part of the Harvard repertoire. When you find yourself feeling less than ideal, know that you’re not alone… even if you may feel lonely quarantining in your room. We guarantee you that any upperclassman you know has experienced a long list of failures, too.
Freshman fall is a shock to your system. Taking on new classes while trying to make friends and get situated to life away from home (or college life at home) is a lot to balance, and honestly just feels overwhelming. And when it’s so easy to look at your peers posting their job opportunities on LinkedIn and presenting their day in curated Instagram stories and filtered posts, it’s hard not to compare yourself to the outward images that others present. Think beyond the laughter you see on Widener steps, and think about the struggles that are a part of everyone’s lives. Freshman year is hard — college is hard — and it’s time that “failure” becomes normalized.
What even is failure? Getting a lower grade than you’re used to on your first midterm or not making it to the second round of that comp? Maybe in the immediate term this all seems unthinkable, but remember that you only really grow in discomfort. It’s important to remember that setbacks, minor or major, are valid, but if nothing will change if you keep dwelling on the loss, then what’s the point of agonizing over mistakes?
Instead of beating yourself up and filling your conscience with negative thoughts, take a deep breath and evaluate your choices. Take some time to be sad (if you need/want to), but then take action. Either use this as motivation to talk to your TF about possible next steps, or go to office hours for more support with classes, or any other steps that may help you learn from this “failure” and move on. If there’s no real “solution” here, try to just take some time to decompress. Reach out to others; being in your room alone may make you feel more isolated, but your friends, family, PAFs, and other members of the first year advising community are here for you.
Sometimes, failure is just a part of the universe’s plan for you. This isn’t a sign that you’re an imposter — this isn’t a game of Among Us… far from it. Everyone has failed at Harvard, especially in their freshman year. Once you start having these open conversations with your peers, upperclassmen, or faculty, you realize that not always succeeding at something is honestly a norm. Not living up to the expectations that you set for yourself and readjusting expectations are a part of adjusting to college life. The best way to deal with failure is just to get through it, take in any lessons, and try again next time.
Love,
Flyby

Ah, fall semester of freshman year. Normally this time is characterized by excessive partying and getting lost on campus, but this year’s first years are dealing with another beast entirely. But even without the physical challenges of freshman year, certain traditions persist. With no (okay, not enough) upperclassmen on campus to tell you what is or isn’t okay to do as a freshman, Flyby has got you covered.
Ditch the Lanyard
Even though this is pretty standard with most first years, the Lanyard Plague has gotten worse this year with no upperclassmen to make fun of freshmen with the standard crimson necklace dangling around their necks. Do yourself a favor and get a keychain, or put it somewhere inconspicuous.
Serial Comper
Usually the geographical challenges of running around from Pfoho to Leverett to the Science Center will stop most freshmen from comping four million clubs. But with Zoom, the potential to overload yourself with clubs is even greater than before. Make sure you only comp clubs you enjoy (*cough* Flyby), and don’t be afraid to drop clubs even if you make it past the comp.
Hooking Up with an Entrymate/Roommate
First of all, COVID-19 is still very much real. Second, we know it can get lonely in the dorms, but unless you want something to implode in your face and destroy your entryway dynamic (we’re not speaking from experience or anything), it’s not generally a good idea to engage in dorm-cest.
Peaked in High School
Without upperclassmen to glare at you when you bring up your first place win at some competition two years ago, it may be tempting to talk about your high school experiences with your newfound friends. And we get it: You did cool stuff in high school, but college isn’t the place where you try to flex on other people. You have LinkedIn for that.
So if you find yourself falling for one of these freshman tropes, catch yourself and then move on. You’ll be okay even if you have a lanyard around your neck… at least until the upperclassmen return to campus.
