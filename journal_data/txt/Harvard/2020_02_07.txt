After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated nine films for Best Picture in one of the most amazing years in film in recent memory. Here is a close analysis of each nominee’s chances, why they should win, and why they won’t, with picks arranged in increasing likelihood to win.
“Ford v Ferrari” dir. James Mangold
This film is exactly what it should be: A well-shot, perfectly paced racing film. Mangold’s high-octane spectacle is beautifully edited eye candy, boosted by flashy cinematography from Phedon Papmichael that flaunts dizzying maneuvers, a grounded camera angle, and stunning wides. However, Mangold’s latest film has received no nominations beyond the technical categories, with no acting, writing, or directing nominations. “Ford v Ferrari” is a slick action film but, by all accounts, won’t be recognized beyond a well-deserved nomination.
“Little Women” dir. Greta Gerwig
“Little Women” hits its stride with Gerwig’s screenplay, which cleverly interweaves two time periods and brandishes pristinely planned overlapping dialogue. However, Gerwig's film has received little palpable support outside its screenplay, and even that support has been sparse; it won for Critics Choice, but wasn’t nominated at the Golden Globes and didn’t win at the BAFTAs or WGAs. It wasn't nominated for Best Editing (only 10 films since 1934 have won Best Picture without an Editing nomination) or Cinematography and Production Design (two technical nominations one would expect a period piece to receive). If the Academy truly wanted to honor “Little Women,” it would have nominated Greta Gerwig for Best Director.
“Marriage Story” dir. Noah Baumbach
“Marriage Story” was an early leading contender for Best Picture, but has since lost a lot of steam. It wasn’t nominated for Best Editing or Best Director, two traditional marks of a Best Picture winner. It hasn’t scored a single Best Original Screenplay win from the major awards bodies (Globes, Critics Choice, Guilds, and British Academy Awards (BAFTAs)), a category it should have had locked down. And the penultimate major awards show, the BAFTAs, left “Marriage Story” out of the Best Picture race entirely.
“Joker” dir. Todd Phillips
The problems with “Joker” don’t lie with its portrayals of violence, or the fact that it’s a superhero movie, but instead with its lazy writing that consistently undermines the intelligence of its audience. “Joker” is the second worst film in the 21st century to ever be nominated for “Best Director” and such a divide is unlikely to see it win “Best Picture.” To see “Joker” come this far at all is baffling, but Phillips' film has been nominated for Best Picture at The Golden Globes, Critics Choice, Producers Guild of America Awards (PGAs), and BAFTAs. Moreover, it has garnered the most Academy Awards nominations of the year at 11, and it’s not impossible that the passion Academy voters have for Joaquin Phoenix’s performance (the clear frontrunner for Best Actor) could bleed over into a Best Picture win.
“Jojo Rabbit” dir. Taika Waititi
“Jojo Rabbit” is this year’s “Green Book.” Not to say that “Jojo Rabbit” is the same film — it’s more daring, more comedic, and more earnest. But the two are eerily similar in terms of accolades. Both films won the People’s Choice Award at TIFF, and both were nominated for Best Director at the Director's Guild of America (DGA) Awards, only to be snubbed by the Academy. Both were also nominated for Best Screenplay and the much-needed editing nomination. “Jojo Rabbit” is one of the only four films to be nominated for the highest award at all the guilds (Writers, Producers, Actors and Directors), joining “Parasite,” “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” and “The Irishman.” A shocker win for "Jojo Rabbit" is not completely out of the picture, especially given its recent resurgence in the Adapted Screenplay category (winning back to back at the Writers Guild and BAFTAs).
“The Irishman” dir. Martin Scorsese
“The Irishman” is a heartbreaking reflection; a rumination on the regrets and decisions we make in life, the legacy we leave behind, and sin. It’s a religious meditation and commentary on mortality as much as it is a gangster epic, and as such it’s in constant conversation with Scorsese’s legendary filmography. “The Irishman” should win Best Picture, but it faces a major setback: It’s on Netflix. Instead of being forced to sit through other nominees as intended in theaters, Academy members (who are working professionals) have the option to watch the film in snippets on a laptop. Netflix is also a major threat to theaters and Hollywood studios. Unsurprisingly, The Academy bent over backwards to avoid giving the award to Alfonso Cuaron’s masterpiece “Roma” (a Netflix film) last year by instead awarding Peter Farrelly’s “Green Book.” Still, “The Irishman” has received nominations for the top prize at all four guilds, has been in the Best Picture conversation at all the awards bodies, and is up for 10 nominations at the Oscars (including Best Editing and Best Director). An upset is still possible.
“Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood” dir. Quentin Tarantino
Could this be the year two-time Academy Award winner Quentin Tarantino bags his first Best Picture win? His love letter to 1960s tinseltown is shot on gorgeous 35mm film, showcases hilarious tour-de-force performances from its leads Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, and wins over audiences with its final 45 minutes of classic Tarantino suspense and cathartic violence. But that begs the question: What happened to the first two hours of the movie? Where is the plot? "Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood" offers a lot of fun, but perhaps isn’t as substantive as the other films nominated in this category. Tarantino's film won Best Picture at the Golden Globes (Musical or Comedy) and at the Critics Choice Awards. It’s one of the four films nominated at all the guilds, and boasts 10 Academy Award nominations. No one loves Hollywood more than Hollywood, so it would be far from surprising to see Tarantino’s 9th and penultimate film take home the big prize.
“Parasite” dir. Bong Joon-ho
Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” is revolutionary: Its groundbreaking premise as a satire-thriller makes it one of the most original films produced in years. It has secured the coveted editing nomination, is one of the four aforementioned films to be recognized for the top prize at all four guilds, and has been nominated for Best Picture at all major awards bodies. “Parasite” even won Best Acting Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild, the largest voting branch of the Academy, despite receiving no individual nominations. Its back to back upsets for Best Original Screenplay over “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” at the WGAs and the BAFTAs is a testament to the film community's love and respect for Bong Joon-ho’s film. However, there is simply little historical precedent for “Parasite” taking Best Picture: No foreign language film has ever won Best Picture, even though “Roma” came dangerously close last year. It also has no acting nominations, and no film has won “Best Picture” without an acting nomination since 2008’s “Slumdog Millionaire.” But all told, “Parasite” is the most likely film to overthrow frontrunner “1917.”
“1917” dir. Sam Mendes
Sam Mendes’ real time, one-take World War I epic stretches the limits of what’s possible with cinema. With an unnerving commitment to natural lighting, meticulous production design, and impossible camera rigs, “1917” uses masterful cinematography from Roger Deakins and detailed sound design to create a visceral experience unlike any film before. “1917” won the Golden Globe (for Best Motion Picture — Drama), the PGA Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture, and the BAFTA for Best Film, which is enough to place it as a clear frontrunner for now. As technically masterful as it is, “1917” is far from the most emotional picture of the year, and the Academy frequently rewards sentimentality (as evidenced by “Green Book” winning last year). “1917” would also be only the second in the last 40 years to win without an editing nomination, but the last film to do so, “Birdman” (2014), was also a one-take movie. The biggest obstacle for “1917” is probably support from actors; like “Parasite,” Mendes’ film didn't receive an acting nomination from the Academy. However, the SAGs, which didn’t nominate “1917” in any category, gave its biggest prize to “Parasite.” “1917” looks like the likely winner, but the door is certainly open for an upset.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The email from former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power came into my inbox at 8:09 p.m. “Hi Kaivan - please don’t be on your phone in class - it is super distracting to your classmates, your profs, and — above all — to you! really important. Thanks!” I was in DPI 535: “Making Change When Change is Hard,” a Harvard Kennedy School course the Ambassador was teaching with her husband, famed legal scholar Cass R. Sunstein ’75. I was embarrassed, as the class had a no technology policy. I responded immediately, apologizing, assuring Ambassador Power that it wouldn’t happen again, and noting that just five minutes before class, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had resigned — a significant moment for anyone focused on change-making and the fight for justice.
Last week I was reminded of that email, in the first session of my Constitutional Law course, when our professor noted that she bans the use of electronics in class, citing “the pedagogy.” The professor told us how exciting the course would be this semester given the relevance of the ongoing impeachment hearings — and encouraged us to keep up with the news. Ironically, impeachment proceedings were literally ongoing this week, including during our 1-3 p.m. class timeslot.
As an online influencer in the progressive political space, I volunteer my time to help the Democratic National Convention, leading presidential candidates, and others amplify key messages surrounding the Trump administration in real-time. Harvard Law professors, politicians, journalists, and celebrities engage with my content directly. As a student at the Kennedy School and the Law School, experiencing the first impeachment of my adult life in this participatory way is a rare and educational opportunity. While it’s important to pay attention in class, spending five minutes of a two-hour-long session reviewing and responding to highlights of the hearings not only allows me to make important connections that will serve me in my legal career (something the Law School should support), but it also allows me to consider the ideas we are learning in a course such as Constitutional Law against an urgent real-world backdrop.
These anti-technology classroom policies are not unique cases. At my MBA program at the Yale School of Management, at the Harvard Kennedy School, and now at Harvard Law School, I’ve been banned from using any technology in many classes, even to take notes. It’s not just a huge disadvantage for someone with illegible handwriting. It’s infantilizing and counterproductive.
It’s true — I made a choice to be a student, and some could argue if I wanted to keep pace with the real world, I should have chosen to work instead. However, this logic is flawed because it undervalues the powerful potential of digital access in the classroom. The first, which I described above, is the discretion that technology affords ambitious, busy multi-taskers to attend to occasional external urgent matters — personal or professional — while still being present and learning in class.
There are also ways technology amplifies even the internal procedures and substance of classes. Allowing students to use technology in the classroom as they would in reality not only creates more time for critical discussion, but greatly expands the level of information and accuracy that can be brought into those discussions. Students and professors won’t spend five minutes searching page by page for that specific Justice Elena Kagan reference in a 100-page Supreme Court opinion — someone will ⌘F the key phrase and the class will move on with the conversation. A loosely remembered relevant source no longer stays on the tip of the tongue, but is confirmed with quick research and shared to enrich the class discussion. Foolish questions neither go unanswered, nor do they waste valuable class time — a win-win for everyone paying thousands of dollars for a single course.
Perhaps a more widely accepted argument is that banning technology forces students to learn in an antediluvian way. This outdated learning mode will never mirror the practice mode of the digital age. We won’t memorize the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure — we’ll Google them. We won’t write out Bayes’ Theorem from memory and “plug and chug” — the process will be automated.
I’ve already experienced this generational shift. When I was in elementary school, cursive was being phased out. In undergrad, I took notes exclusively on my laptop. I’m used to a multi-sensory learning environment of PowerPoint slides and online in-class polls that enhance discussions. That’s the future of education. In a world where all information is at our fingertips, application beats memorization every time.
I’m not necessarily surprised that graduate schools are slow to adjust to this tech-friendly future, but I was shocked that many of my peers are too. In my MBA program, many of my classmates, roughly 28 years old on average, were supportive of laptops being banned. They cited the same reasons as Ambassador Power — they were “distracted.” Having come of age in an era of immersive tech, I couldn’t imagine people with the lofty goals of my business school peers succeeding if they were so readily thrown off by a dimly lit screen and some low-decibel typing in the row in front of them.
We are adults, in our twenties, at an elite graduate school program, paying for education — it’s our time. To be regulated on our access to technology, including to the outside world, is reductive and juvenile. At the risk of sounding crass, I was responsible and focused enough to get into Harvard — trust me to make the right choices for my own education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard University Housing announced rent increases for University-owned apartments in the 2020-21 academic year averaging one percent but up to two percent in some cases, on a unit-by-unit basis. The University reached this conclusion after a private consultant revised “market rents” for a number of apartments in Cambridge and surrounding areas.
We are conflicted about this increase. The move has drawn criticism from some graduate students who feel that the increased price tag will put University-owned housing out of reach. We empathize deeply with the students who feel that the institution they give so much of their time and effort to, at very low wages, is exploiting them for a free-market price. All of their voices matter to us. And we continue to believe that graduate student stipends should be indexed to the cost of living.
We must, however, simultaneously recognize that Harvard can only provide 50 percent of graduate students with housing. Not sticking to a market price would force the University to decide which half of the students should receive housing that is below market price and which half should not. Such a conundrum would be an equally, if not more troubling, ethical strain.
Still, further context is necessary. Harvard’s student housing does not operate in a vacuum. And though Harvard may seek to peg its rent rates to market prices, it is critical to note that Harvard’s expansive housing system has an outsized impact on the market itself. We should not forget that Harvard continues to have a direct impact on the ability of Cambridge residents to access affordable housing themselves, a problem that has preoccupied the city of Cambridge in the past year.
In an enlightening 2018 report, the Harvard College Open Data Project shows the extent to which the expansion of Harvard in recent years has gone hand in hand with the marginalization and reduction of local communities and in particular communities of color. Harvard, which owned nearly 10 percent of the land in Cambridge and nearly six percent of the land in Allston as of 2018, has seen its landholdings grow by over two and a half times since 2000. At the same time, in the ten years prior to 2018, Cambridge had one of the highest rates of home appreciation in the country, growing at an annual rate of 4.98 percent.
Still more startling, however, is that, controlling for relevant externalities, as Harvard’s endowment and landholdings have grown, the population of black and low-income residents of Cambridge has declined. While Harvard last year pledged $20 million to support affordable housing in the Greater Boston area, its gentrifying influence on Cambridge continues to concern us and, no doubt, the community bearing the brunt of the effects.
None of our concerns about Harvard’s adverse effects on its neighbors is meant to downplay the challenges that graduate students face or the extent to which the University’s financial prerogatives seem to be pitted against its oft-overlapping student and labor bodies. Still, we hope that our internal debates at Harvard — especially those that deal with issues of equity, land use, community impact, diversity and inclusion, and livelihood — are thoroughly contextualized within the broader issues that affect Cambridge and all its inhabitants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I come from a lineage of geniuses.
My Samoan ancestors were so intelligent that they figured out how to sail across the Pacific using only the stars as their guide. Can you imagine that? People nowadays can barely get from point A to point B without Google Maps dictating each and every step that they’re supposed to take.
The genius of my Samoan ancestors is still evident in the elders and the youth of my Samoan community. My cousins and I sit on the floor of the faleo’o and absorb the wisdom passed onto us by our grandfather, as he practices the sacred tradition of oral history and storytelling — tracing our family tree generations back and recounting memories that are not even his own. When it comes time to practice and perform the traditional dances of the siva, sasa, and fa’ataupati, the village youth perfect each careful movement with ease, naturally remaining in sync with each other to every beat of the pate.
Though I come from a lineage and community of geniuses, this secret was kept from me. In school, they did not teach me about the ingenuity of my Polynesian ancestors and their ancient art of navigation. Instead, they taught about great explorers like Christopher Columbus who sailed to what is now the Americas but initially thought he was in the East Indies. Oral history and storytelling was merely a fun hobby because my school taught me that in order to be considered valid and sophisticated storytelling had to follow a rigid five-paragraph structure with advanced English vocabulary. And with all of the stereotypes about our people as nothing more than “dumb jocks” because of our statistically low SAT/ACT scores but statistically high probability of making it into the NFL, I never considered the physically instinctive synchronization with my peers in our traditional dances as a form of intelligence.
The American school system, curriculum, and methodologies for measuring intelligence do not capture the genius of my community. Instead, they completely erase it and brainwash us into thinking that there exists only one way of knowing. American primary, secondary, and higher education systems are some of the strongest instruments of colonial domination to suppress indigenous ways of knowing.
American-style schools distort or more often than not completely refuse to teach our histories. This is evident in that history textbooks mention indigenous people as being “discovered” or that elite universities such as Harvard refuse to institute ethnic studies departments. Additionally, the American education system’s measurements for intelligence rely on so-called “objective” tests that disadvantage students whose first language is not English and whose imaginations cannot be contained by rigid processes taught in the classroom.
I realize the privilege and hypocrisy from which I speak, being a student at Harvard — the ivory tower of prestige and white-washed education. Every time I go home, it saddens me to see my own community put me on a pedestal because of my acceptance into this institution.  The romanticization of Western education only further devalues our own ways of knowing and reifies white-washed education systems.
As my senior year approaches and I start thinking about my senior thesis, I continue to struggle with the idea that I must follow specific, concentration-approved methodologies and processes in order to produce valid knowledge about my own community. Is this not the ultimate betrayal of my community and my ingenious ancestors that came before me? Some say that my presence at an institution such as this is a positive sign of progress and increase of Pacific Islander representation on campus. But if that is the case, why do I feel like my presence here only reaffirms the erasure of my people?
I understand that sometimes an education is the best route, both for personal upward mobility and for greater representation and visibility of a community. But the best option for my community, as well as other indigenous communities, should not be something that simultaneously erases it.

Diego A. Garcia Blum, vice president of diversity in the Harvard Kennedy School student government, introduced the optional use of gender pronoun stickers on nametags and placards as “a welcome signal” for transgender and nonbinary students at HKS.
Garcia Blum explained the decision to introduce the pronoun stickers in a Jan. 31 email he sent to HKS faculty and staff.
“Often people assume what pronouns other people use by how a person looks like, but this can lead to mistakes that can hurt and exclude people,” he wrote. “The use of visible pronoun stickers is a welcome signal to our trans and gender nonconforming students to be their full selves in any space in our school.”
Garcia Blum said in an interview that he believes the stickers can serve to educate HKS students, faculty, and staff on pronoun usage.
“There are a lot of people here from the Kennedy School who — this is something completely new to them,” he said. “If you’re unsure about the pronouns somebody may use, it’s okay to ask. And if you see somebody that has something like gender nonbinary pronouns, you know, it’s something that you understand, and you can address them correctly.”
Garcia Blum further talked about how gender identity issues are “something that Harvard, overall, needs to do better at.”
“I don’t see any other place that has pronoun stickers or pronoun markers on the placards,” he said.
Morgan R. Pratt, a student at HKS, wrote in an email that, although they do not personally use the stickers, they appreciate the significance of the gesture.
“I identify as non-binary because gender is not important to me--putting a sticker right next to my name ironically feels like it would make gender a disproportionately prominent part of my identity,” they wrote. “That being said, I was very proud to see the activism around pronouns here at HKS. It makes me feel more respected in a sea of people otherwise ignoring or opposing the issue.”
HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote an email to The Crimson noting the school administration’s support for the stickers.
“We thought that our students’ idea to introduce these stickers was a great way to help make every student feel fully welcome at the Kennedy School, so we ensured that the message announcing the stickers went to all of our faculty and staff as well as all of our students,” he wrote.
The small stickers — with phrases like “My Pronouns Are: He/Him” — are located in bins in a student lounge near room 309 in the Kennedy School's Ofer building.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston city planners are moving forward with the development of “Allston Yards,” a sprawling building complex located in the Allston-Brighton area, after approving the project Dec. 12.
Located at 60 Everett Street, the complex includes four buildings, scaling at a gross floor area of 1.2 million square feet. The space will encompass 868 housing units — 148 of which are low-income units — as well as a supermarket, office spaces, and retail stores.
The Boston Planning and Development Agency, the zoning authority in the Boston area, cast the vote to approve the project. Critics of the plan urged BPDA to delay the vote so that parties involved could further negotiate over the number of affordable housing units, homeownership opportunities, and community benefits associated with the complex. Still, the vote was passed unanimously on the original date.
Boston City Councilor Elizabeth Breadon, who was among those who advocated for a delay, said she is nonetheless optimistic about the project’s potential benefits for residents — including Harvard affiliates.
“We want projects to be affordable, be energy efficient, and offer opportunities for local small businesses,” she wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson. “We need these projects to have well-thought-out access to public transit so that we can lower our dependence on cars. We are hopeful residents of Allston, including Harvard students, benefit from additional businesses and an improved public transit system.”
Some residents said they had hoped the project would include more affordable housing.
“They’re only sitting at 13 to 17 percent margin of affordability,” Allston resident Timothy F. McHale said. “We’d like the city to do better.”
“Twenty percent for all developers, so that’s kind of our mantra,” he added.
McHale also said he wished the development would bring more community benefits.
“Our dear University has negotiated with the city and the neighborhood a factor of about $40 to $50 per square foot of community benefits. That is what I’d like to see all projects,” he said. “By our reckoning, the Allston Yards project is coming in at about half that.”
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, who serves as president of the Allston Civic Association, said he views the development as a “missed opportunity” for a “real win-win situation” between residents and the developer.
“We were hoping to have 20 percent of the units affordable,” he said. “They started off with the minimum 13 percent and then, through the long community review process, they eventually revised it up to 17 percent, but never got quite to the 20 percent.”
D’Isidoro also said he wished the project would provide more opportunities for homeownership.
“We kind of feel like the homeownership rate is so low and we try to encourage developers to do more homeownership opportunities,” he said. “We were hoping that half would be rental and half would be condo.”
BPDA spokesperson Molly McGlynn wrote in an emailed statement that the proponent had decided to increase its contribution to the Allston Brighton Homeowner Fund to $4 million “in response to community feedback.”
“This fund will help to fund down payment assistance, homeownership programs with affordability components, home repair loans and/or Homebuyer 101 classes for income qualified individuals and families to support ownership housing availability, affordability and stability,” she wrote.
D’Isidoro said he and other Allston residents plan to continue to voice their concerns as further developments enter the neighborhood.
“The community continues to fight for more homeownership opportunities, for greater affordability than the minimum that the city requires, for deeper affordability where we can get homeownership,” D’Isidoro said.

Datamatch — a free matchmaking service run by Harvard students — doubled in size this year, and is scheduled to open at 12:01 a.m. on Friday morning at colleges across the United States and Canada.
Datamatch participants answer an online survey, and a “top secret” algorithm provides them with matches on the morning of Valentine’s Day. Unique to Harvard’s Datamatch is an option for paired students to get free food from a local restaurant. This year, several restaurants in Harvard Square — including BerryLine, Black Sheep Bagel, Amorino, and the recently opened Kung Fu Tea — have partnered with Datamatch to offer free food to paired students.
The matchmaking service was started by Harvard students in 1994 and — except for a pause in 1997 — has served Harvard students every year since then. In 2018, Datamatch expanded to three additional schools, and in 2019, Datamatch became available at 13 schools. This year, the service will be offered at 26 schools — and make its international debut at McGill University.
According to Theodore T. Liu ’20, one of the presidents — or “Supreme Cupids” — of Datamatch, other schools assemble their own small Datamatch teams so they can tailor the survey toward their colleges.
“We usually have around two to five people at each school that’s helping out both with writing questions that are kind of specific to the school and the inside jokes — they know the culture of the school — as well as kind of being that publicity person over there,” Liu, a former Crimson Technology chair, said.
Madison I. Richmond, a sophomore at New York University, said in an interview that she saw Datamatch on a friend’s social media, and discovered — a mere four days before this year’s launch — that NYU was not one of the schools that offered the matching survey.
“I went on the website, and I found the emails, and I just kind of typed in all caps: WE WANT DATAMATCH AT NYU,” Richmond said.
In just three days, she and one other student put together NYU-specific survey questions just in time for this year’s launch.
“For me it was really about the fun of it, kind of the jokes, the buzz, bringing something new,” Richmond said. “I think it's really awesome the way that technology can connect people on our campus, especially because NYU is so big and it doesn't really have a campus.”
Though NYU only joined Datamatch a few days ago, Liu and the other “Supreme Cupid,” Ryan Y. Lee ’20, said that the Harvard team has been meeting since October.
“It's always a full school year process. Even in September we're already trying to form teams and get the word out about Datamatch,” Lee said.
The five Datamatch teams — web, algorithm, design, stats, and business — each focus on a different component of the project. On Valentine’s Day, when Datamatch participants are given their results, this year’s Cupids conclude months of work on the project — which saw its biggest expansion to date.
“Across other schools, we do want to provide that same excitement and joy that we've been able to capture here for the past 25 plus years,” Lee said. “Just kind of get them in on the fun.”

After raising $1.4 billion, Harvard came in second among American universities in total funds raised in the last academic fiscal year, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday.
Harvard had topped the list of academic fundraisers since 2016. Johns Hopkins University claimed the top spot this year after it brought in $2.7 billion between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019, according to a report from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education released Wednesday.
The majority of Johns Hopkins’s funds came from former New York City mayor and current Democratic presidential candidate Michael R. Bloomberg, an alumnus of the school.
In Nov. 2018, Bloomberg pledged $1.8 billion to Johns Hopkins to help fund scholarships for low- and middle-income students. The donation enabled the school to adopt need-blind admissions practices and remove loans from financial aid packages. The gift is the single largest donation on record to an American academic institution.
Even excluding the gift from Bloomberg, Johns Hopkins raised $900 million, a figure that would have placed it just behind Harvard and Stanford, which raised $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
Thomas D. Parker ’64 — a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy — said he was impressed with the amount that Johns Hopkins raised, given its number of graduates.
“In that top ten, most — not all, but most — of the institutions have very large numbers of graduates, and you have to have very large numbers of graduates to generate very large amounts of money,” Parker said. “Hopkins deserves a lot of credit. They've done a great fundraising job.”
Despite its ten-figure fundraising totals, Parker said that Harvard’s fundraising intake still falls short of ideal, given its annual budget. Operating expenses at the University totaled $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2019, per its year-end financial report.
“They're not even raising their annual budget, and if you look at it that way, it's not a very big number,” Parker said. “You sort of wish that number were larger.”
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Donald M. Fellows, a senior fundraising consultant at Marts & Lundy, emphasized that all donation numbers are relative.
“It's all relative to the type of institution, the size,” Fellows said. “The budget for a massive research university like Harvard, Stanford, MIT, they're huge, compared to a lot of other institutions or organizations.”
He cited costs ranging from financial aid, recruitment of high-caliber faculty, and facilities maintenance and upgrades.
“It's relative to the nature of these institutions. They are very, very expensive,” Fellows said. “The cost factors are huge. That's what tends to drive the larger gifts, and the greater need of those institutions to raise more money.”
Overall, colleges and universities raised nearly $50 billion in the last academic fiscal year — the highest level ever reported. This marks the tenth consecutive year that total academic fundraising has grown, per the council’s report.
Still, Parker said he believes the fundraising levels are concerning.
“None of the major fundraising universities in the country are doing enough. All of them are still kind of running scared,” Parker said. “I know that seems counterintuitive because those numbers look so big, but the costs are big as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 30 Winthrop House affiliates called on College administrators to keep interim faculty deans Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan in their roles at a house forum Thursday.
Former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and College Dean for Administration Sheila C. Thimba hosted Thursday’s event to hear student feedback about factors the College should consider when conducting its faculty dean search. The event came after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that his office would soon begin accepting nominations for faculty dean candidates in an email to Winthrop residents Tuesday.
Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan have led the House since August, after the College decided not to renew former Winthrop faculty deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson’s contract in May. The decision came amid a semester-long controversy over Sullivan’s decision to represent Hollywood producer and accused sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein.
During the event, students shared some of their positive experiences with Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan. They recalled that, during their time helming Winthrop, Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan hosted Winthrop residents who could not go home during Thanksgiving break, attended students’ performing arts or intramural sports events, and watered a student’s hanging ivy plants.
Nicholas C. Fahy ’22 said Herlihy-Gearan often folded large piles of abandoned laundry during the summer for students to pick up.
Julie R. Hartman ’22 described the relationship between Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan and Winthrop as a “match made in heaven.”
“I can tell so many stories about how they have completely made my year and how they've enriched my life forever,” she said. “It is not an understatement to say that nothing I say is unimportant to them. I really feel that they listen.”
Outside the town hall, some Winthrop students have turned to other forums to advocate for Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan’s selection. A group of Winthrop residents circulated a petition urging the administration to permanently install the pair as permanent faculty deans.
In response to student questions about Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan’s eligibility for the permanent position, Dingman pointed to a College requirement that faculty deans hold a tenured professorship, preferably in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“It's been an understanding that the stronger, more permanent faculty we can attract, then we can have this five-year initial term renewable for another five years. With tenure, you're sure of a role for life,” he said. “Also, it says something about living and learning in that these houses are not retreats from the academic life of institutions but are led by senior faculty members.”
Hartman said the College should prioritize a faculty dean’s ability to make a house feel like “home” over “academic prestige.” She also argued that Gearan’s role as the director of the Institute of Politics — which primarily engages with undergraduates — equips him to connect with Winthrop residents intellectually.
Winthrop tutor Benny Goldman said Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan’s attentiveness to student interests is reflected in the number and diversity of faculty members they have invited to speak with students in the house.
“Mark and Mary have fostered an incredible environment that students who have a variety of interests can thrive in,” Goldman said. “Even though they’re not tenured faculty, they still know what's going on broadly and what the students are interested in and they’ve done a fabulous job facilitating events around that.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan were announced as interim deans who would serve only for the year, referring to an announcement made in the fall about the impending search for new deans.
The College will soon convene a search advisory committee for new deans. Thimba said during the discussion that the College hopes to conclude its search by the end of April and announce the new faculty deans before the summer. In addition to Winthrop, the College will also fill faculty dean posts in Quincy, Kirkland, Cabot, and Eliot before the year is out.

In Harvard’s annual Board of Overseers elections, political campaigns advocating for divestment from controversial industries, eliminating tuition cost, and admissions changes date back over 40 years.
Harvard degree holders are elected to the Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing body — through an election scheduled every spring. To be listed on the ballot, candidates can either be selected by a Harvard Alumni Association nomination committee or secure sufficient petition signatures from eligible voters. Members of the Board serve six-year terms.
Overseers can influence Harvard’s strategic decisions, review University schools and programs through a periodic visitation process, and approve the election of members of the Harvard Corporation — Harvard’s highest governing board.
This year’s election for the Board of Overseers presented a slate of young alumni, backed by student and alumni group Harvard Forward, who are campaigning for fossil fuel divestment and increased recent alumni representation on the governing board.
Though the group’s five candidates were not selected by Harvard’s nomination committee, Harvard Forward later collected more than 4,500 petition signatures for each of its candidates. Roughly 3,000 signatures were required to nominate a Board of Overseers candidate by petition this year.
Harvard Forward is not the only advocacy organization that has strategized within the annual Board of Overseers election to advocate for its causes. Advocacy groups including the Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid and “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” backed their own Board of Overseers tickets in the 1980s and 2016, respectively.
Organizers for these groups, however, faced difficulties getting their candidates on the ballot — a challenge that members of Harvard Forward said they are facing today.
Beginning in 1986, the Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid group, or the HRAAA, nominated candidates for the Board of Overseers with the goal of electing overseers who would encourage the University to end South African-related investments. Their campaign endorsed candidates for more than five different election cycles.
The group succeeded in electing four of its candidates to the Board of Overseers: former Crimson president and current professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin Gay W. Seidman ’78, current Duke University professor emiritus Peter H. Wood ’64, former legal counsel to the House Energy and Commerce Committee Consuela M. Washington, and then-South African Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu.
Donald M. Solomon, the former executive director of HRAAA, said that the nominating policy changed after the first election the group participated in.
“After the first election — which we ran petition candidates — I do remember Harvard changed the requirements and made it more difficult to get candidates on the ballot,” Solomon said.
He said that though he could not recall the exact changes, HRAAA had to work harder to get people on the ballot.
“At that time, we didn’t have online organizing opportunities,” Solomon said. “Whatever we did was mostly through direct mail and that made it expensive to run any sort of petitioning campaign.”
In 1989, Tutu won a seat on the Board of Overseers after petitioning for his nomination. Tutu was a longtime critic of the University’s investment policies in South Africa, and in 1984, he urged Harvard to divest from South Africa-related investments.
In 1991, to make its slate of candidates more competitive and condense its pool of endorsements, the HRAAA only nominated three candidates for the election. Among the candidates HRAA nominated in 1991 was former U.S. President Barack Obama, a fourth-year Harvard Law School student at the time.
“Desmond Tutu was — I think — the most successful [election],” Solomon said. “I think our feeling was that we probably couldn’t duplicate that in terms of having a recognizable big name. Obviously, we knew Barack Obama was a talented person but we didn’t anticipate that he’d become President.”
2016 brought a controversial campaign and further changes to the eligibility requirements of candidates running for the Board of Overseers.
That spring, a contentious ticket called “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” – which included former U.S. presidential candidate Ralph Nader – ran for the Board on two central platforms: terminate undergraduate tuition, and scrutinize Harvard’s admissions policy, which the group contended was discriminatory to Asian Americans and antithetical to diversity. The group also called on Harvard to make more data public about the processes by which the College admits students.
A group of nearly 500 alumni formed to oppose “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard.” The group, called “Coalition for a Diverse Harvard,” denounced the proposals by the campaign.
Former University President Drew G. Faust criticized “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard’s” platform in a 2016 interview with The Crimson, during which she denounced the idea that eliminating the University’s tuition would make Harvard more accessible to students.
After the controversial ticket in 2016, the University increased the number of signatures required to qualify a petition candidate by more than tenfold. The policies increased the number of requisite signatures from 201 to nearly 3,000 — approximately one percent of the eligible voting population.
The increase was adopted because the necessary number of signatures required to nominate candidates had not changed significantly in over a century, according to a 2016 statement from the University.
“This increase was adopted in view of such factors as the magnitude of alumni support considered appropriate to qualify for the ballot; the fact that in recent years the number of required signatures—just over 200–has been barely more than what was required a century ago, when there were around 20,000 alumni eligible to vote,” the announcement reads.
With the increase in the required number of signatures, the University changed the voting process itself by transitioning to a secure online system to vote for candidates instead of having alumni submit official watermarked forms.
Kenji Yoshino ’91, who served as the president of the Board of Overseers for 2016-2017, said in an announcement at the time that the Board was pleased to move its voting process online.
“We’re pleased to move to online voting, which alumni around the world have asked us to adopt,” Yoshino said in the announcement. “We will make this change as soon as we can put a secure and reliable system in place.”
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy wrote in an email Thursday that the school started online voting “to provide greater and easier access for more alumni around the world to participate in the process.”
After past insurgent Board of Overseers campaigns drove up nominating thresholds, Harvard Forward faced its own challenges to get its candidates on the ballot.
Each of Harvard Forward’s candidates received more one thousand signatures above the requisite number, according to a press release from the group last week.
“The final signature count, pending verification from the Office of the Governing Boards, consists of nearly 1,400 online signers and more than 3,400 unique in-person signers,” the press release stated. “As each candidate must be nominated individually, the campaign ultimately collected over 20,000 separate signatures.”
Harvard Forward’s Campaign Manager Danielle O. Strasburger ’18 wrote in a press release that the milestone was reached despite alumni difficulty with the online nomination process.
“We reached this milestone despite hundreds of alumni encountering real difficulties with Harvard’s complex online nomination process,” Strasburger wrote in the press release. “By our estimates, almost 1,000 additional alumni were unable to submit their nominations because of the poor design of the system.”
The University is dedicated to assisting the school’s alumni network, Hennessy wrote in an email Thursday.
Eligible voters could submit their signatures either through the online form or a paper document. Strasburger wrote in a press release that Harvard Forward organizers directed their efforts to acquire more paper petitions from alumni.
“Of course, switching our focus toward using paper petitions required that we build and mobilize a large network of volunteers and supporters around the world,” Strasburger wrote. “They will continue to be the driving force of this campaign as we prepare for the coming election.”
Harvard has received the nomination forms, Hennessy confirmed Saturday. The University will now verify and validate petition submissions over the next two weeks.
While waiting for the official confirmation for the group’s petition, Harvard Forward scheduled strategy calls to discuss election and publicity strategies, according to a Thursday email sent to supporters.

When Harvard faculty members disagree, they often do so in polite speeches at faculty meetings and formal letters to deans.
Harvard Law School professors Laurence H. Tribe ’62 and Alan M. Dershowitz argue differently, though. The pair of legal scholars has spent the past several weeks engaging in a public, personal feud unlike perhaps any other at the University, sparked by Dershowitz’s decision to defend President Donald J. Trump in his Senate impeachment trial.
“I thought that he had become a bit of a publicity hog and a celebrity seeking fellow who cared less about justice than about fame and fortune,” Tribe said in an interview about Dershowitz.
“He is a zealot and a partisan,” Dershowitz said about Tribe.
Dershowitz formally joined Trump’s defense team on Jan. 17, announcing on Twitter he would deliver oral statements to the Senate to explain the constitutional arguments against impeachment. The trial, which concluded Wednesday, cleared Trump of both charges against him — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Soon after Dershowitz’s announcement, Tribe joined a chorus of legal scholars questioning his arguments. Still, Tribe was one of few critics who could claim personal ties to Dershowitz spanning decades.
“Although I am hesitant to call out a friend and former colleague as being a danger to democracy, I finally decided that Alan Dershowitz because of his – at least, former – credibility had become such a danger that I could no longer hold back, and I, therefore, began to feel quite free to say what an idiotic argument I thought he was making,” Tribe said in an interview last Tuesday.
Dershowitz, for his part, said Tribe has unfairly attempted to silence him.
“The critical senators seem to accept my argument, or at least to take it seriously. And I would expect that fellow academics would do the same,” he said.
While Dershowitz and Tribe may disagree about the merits of impeaching Trump, they share at least one thing: a resume littered with prestigious accomplishments.
A Brooklyn, N.Y. native, Dershowitz graduated from Brooklyn College and Yale Law School before joining the Harvard Law School faculty at age 25. Touted as “the best-known criminal lawyer in the world” and “America’s most public Jewish defender” in his Law School biography, he has defended high-profile and controversial clients such as billionaire and accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and football star O.J. Simpson.
Law School professor Charles Fried said in an interview Wednesday that he considers Dershowitz an intelligent scholar.
“He was always considered an electric and brilliant teacher of criminal law just right from the very start,” he said.
Tribe, a graduate of both the College and the Law School, began teaching at Harvard in 1968. He helped write the constitutions of South Africa, the Czech Republic, and the Marshall Islands, and holds the title University Professor — considered Harvard’s highest academic honor for faculty.
Though the two professors never worked together directly on campus, both described their relationship prior to Dershowitz’s retirement as professional and good-natured.
“I wouldn't say we were close friends, but we were certainly friends,” Tribe said.
“I proposed him to President Clinton for Solicitor General of the United States,” Dershowitz said. “I've always had respect for his ideas.”
Before recent events, Tribe said he and Dershowitz had just one prior dust-up. While both teaching at the Law School in 1992, the two professors disagreed about the appropriateness of a Harvard Law Review “parody” of a colleague’s deceased wife.
Tribe said he wanted the Law School to note the incident on the transcripts of the students who wrote the article; Dershowitz argued against censuring them.
“Ever since then, we’ve been a little distant because he thought he is the only pure civil libertarian around and that I was one of the compromised ones, and one of the things that is most kind of difficult to deal with about Alan is how he thinks that he’s the only principled person around,” he said.
The 1992 argument, however, was just a preview of events to come.
Though Tribe said he and Dershowitz have had some previous differences of opinion, their arguments have become increasingly public amid the impeachment debate.
In both his formal defense of Trump and online, Dershowitz claimed that the charges brought by the U.S. House of Representatives against Trump are not impeachable offenses according to the Constitution. He said the Constitution does not explicitly include the terms used to describe the charges and that its authors would not approve of them.
“My views are that impeachment cannot be based on vague, open-ended terms like ‘abuse of power’ and ‘obstruction of Congress,’” Dershowitz said. “Those terms can be applied to almost any president, and they’re dangerous.”
Tribe said that — even if the House’s language contains ambiguities — the impeachment trial should rest upon Trump’s actions rather than linguistic questions.
“Obviously, that phrase in itself has a degree of vagueness and ambiguity, but that’s only the label of the impeachment charge,” Tribe said. “In order to determine whether someone has been charged properly with impeachable offenses, one has to look at the specific conduct that is claimed.”
“It seems that my former colleague has this view that ‘abuse of power’ is not a permissible category of impeachable offense, which couldn’t be farther from the truth,” he added. “Abuse of power is the characteristic impeachable offense.”
Following Dershowitz’s testimony before the Senate, several legal experts joined Tribe in countering his arguments. Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, compared Dershowitz to opponents of the climate change movement.
“Dershowitz’s view of what constitutes an impeachable offense is as indefensible and rejected by scholars as climate deniers,” Mariotto wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. “Not a single constitutional scholar agrees with his view.”
Michael J. Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who specializes in conflicts between Congress and the President, disputed another aspect of Dershowitz’s claim.
“Professor Dershowitz made what I think was a very bizarre argument about if a president believes something’s in his purse — if he believes that what he’s doing is in the nation's best interest — he apparently can do anything he wants, and that strikes me as completely wrong,” Gerhardt said.
But Tribe said his concerns about Dershowitz’s arguments stretch beyond impeachment.
“My fundamental disagreement with Professor Dershowitz is that if his view were to prevail, the country would be fundamentally at the mercy of future presidents who want to use their official powers in order to benefit themselves and corrupt our elections and ensure their reelection,” he said.
Dershowitz and Tribe have disagreed about Law School issues and constitutional questions. But the duo have also criticized one another personally in tweets and interviews.
“Tribe so afraid of the Senate hearing my constitutional arguments that he actually says, I ‘should not be allowed’ to make them. Is that the American way?” Dershowitz wrote on Twitter on Jan. 20.
“The @AlanDersh Narcissist defense puts even the Twinkie defense to shame,” Tribe wrote on Jan. 30, referencing a controversial legal argument made while Dan White faced trial for the murder of former San Francisco mayor Harvey Milk.
Dershowitz claimed the dispute has been largely one-sided, charging that Tribe made legal arguments personal.
“Tribe decided to engage in personal ad hominem attacks on me and my ideas,” Dershowitz said. “He characterized my legal conclusions as ‘bonkers’ and ‘crud, C-R-U-D’ despite the fact that they are supported by 19th-century scholars, justices, former justices, and lawyers.”
Tribe countered that claim: he alleged Dershowitz has told multiple reporters that Tribe is jealous of him.
“Nothing could be further from the truth,” Tribe said. “The person I would least like to be on our faculty is Alan Dershowitz.”
In a bid to move their arguments from Twitter, Dershowitz said he hoped to engage Tribe in an in-person debate over the law.
“I challenge my friend and former colleague, Larry Tribe, to an academic serious debate about these issues — about what the constitutional grounds for impeachment are, what the framers intended — and I hope you will accept my challenge instead of, you know, juvenile name-calling and schoolyard epithets,” Dershowitz said.
At least one student who knew both Tribe and Dershowitz said comparing the pair’s arguments is fruitless. Political commentator Elie Y. Mystal ’00, a graduate of the Law School, wrote in an email that the two professors engage in entirely different lines of work.
“It’s like comparing an astrophysicist to a zoologist,” he wrote. “They’re both technically scientists, but if you just go to random office hours in the Science Center asking “when will we die” you’re going to get very different answers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Classroom to Table — a popular program that subsidizes meals for College undergraduates and their professors in Harvard Square — is “on hiatus” for the entire spring semester after running out of funding for the rest of the year, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh announced in an email to colleagues on Jan. 27.
“We are taking a break this semester and using the opportunity to gather a group of faculty, students, and administrators to think about how to best organize the program going forward,” College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement.
The most recent iteration of the initiative allowed groups of three to five students to accompany a faculty member to dine at one of five partner restaurants: Grafton Street, Park Restaurant, Russell House Tavern, The Hourly Oyster House, and Temple Bar. The College funded up to $30 per person to cover the cost of the meal, not including alcoholic beverages.
The program hosted 644 gatherings in the fall, during which 2329 students dined with faculty members, according to Claybaugh. This marks an increase from fall 2018 — when administrators halted the outings after 406 meals — but still less than two years ago, when there were a total of 894 gatherings in one semester.
Government preceptor David D. Kane wrote in an email that the program was “one of the best uses of Harvard’s resources” geared toward engaging students with their professors. He wrote that he plans to continue connecting with students over meals, albeit funding them out of his own pocket.
“There is nothing better than breaking bread with someone to get to know them,” Kane wrote. “I hope they bring the program back. In the meantime, I am still inviting students to lunch but, sad to say, on a Preceptor's salary, it is not easy!”
Dane wrote in an email that Classroom to Table is a “valuable program” and added that the College sees “high participation rates” as indicative of student and faculty interest.
Melody Wang ’22 wrote in an email that she was “disappointed” to hear about the program’s hiatus.
“For me, that was one of the few opportunities to closely interact with professors who taught massive lecture classes, and it was such a meaningful experience to connect with these professors on a personal level,” she said. “I hope it will be able to make its return as swiftly as possible.”
This fall marked the first semester in several years when the program ran the entire term without stopping. The program has skyrocketed in popularity since its pilot in 2015, driving administrators to implement increasingly stringent usage restrictions to allow more students to participate.
Starting in spring 2017, the Office of Undergraduate Education set a cap of four meals per student for each semester. In spring 2018, the cap was reduced to the current limit of two meals per student. But funding issues persisted, leading the College to suspend the program mid-semester for another three straight terms.
Classroom to Table has allotted increasing sums of money for outings over the past several years. At the program’s inception, the College subsidized $20 per student per meal, which increased to $25 in 2016 and $30 in 2017.
In the past, the College has repeatedly declined to disclose funding sources for the program. Senior Gift — an initiative encouraging graduates from each class to donate to financial aid in addition to an “unrestricted fund” — has contributed to the program’s funding in the past.
An Office of Undergraduate Education website notice invites Harvard affiliates to share suggestions with the review committee via email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Digging itself cavernous 19-point and 23-point holes before halftime, the Crimson mounted two vigorous comeback efforts against Penn and Princeton. But despite a fury of late threes from the likes of Justin Bassey and Danilo Djuricic, the clutch late-shooting of Noah Kirkwood, and lasered defensive focus in the final stretch of play, the Crimson dropped right at the precipice of its dogged climb — twice.
Now, the core senior class sees itself at a foreign 2-2 to start Ivy play and must gaze up at two so-far-perfect teams, Princeton and Yale. Compounded by another inhospitable weekend on the road — this time at New Haven and Providence — the Crimson may soon be at-risk of having more than individual games to crawl out of.
But as it prepares for (what certainly feels like) the final weekend away from Lavietes Pavilion, the message from Coach Tommy Amaker is clear — the Ivy League is too unpredictable to ‘overthink’ placement in early February, and the team’s resilience and existing talent is enough to get back on top.
“As I told our guys, it's a long horse race,” Amaker said. “...We just need to kind of keep our noses to the grindstone, and keep working and putting in our time and effort and preparation. We're good enough to win games if we can certainly do these little things along the way.”
One of those “little things”, according to senior guard Christian Juzang, is preventing lapses of attention on the defensive side, particularly in hostile road environments.
“Honestly, I think it's like an intangible thing, but just making sure we don't have any breakdowns on coverages, things that they can kind of get that momentum,” Juzang said. “Especially on the road it can get out of hand, pretty quickly.”
On Friday, Harvard will re-enter a familiar dragon’s lair, one which has in past matchups represented just how heart-throbbing and teetering rivalry contests can be. Last season, the Crimson’s Bryce Aiken zoomed coast-to-coast and silenced most of the John J. Lee Amphitheater with a buzzer-beating fadeaway. But Yale paid back the favors when it mattered the most, stomping the Crimson in the second half of the Ivy Tournament final to book its second NCAA appearance in four years.
This year’s Bulldogs team is arguably even better. Receiving votes in the AP Top 25 and leading the Ivy League in almost every team and individual category (points scored/game, points allowed/game, field goal percentage, three-pointers made, individual rebounding leader, individual three-point leader, etc), the Bulldogs sit an impressive 15-4 with near-losses to Power-Five North Carolina, Penn State, and Oklahoma State.
It has both the interior size — led by senior forward Jordan Bruner (Ivy lead rebounder) and junior forward Paul Atkinson (Ivy most accurate field-goal getter) — as well as the perimeter shooting to quickly string together dangerous stretches of play. Junior sharpshooter Azar Swain has converted on 163 triples this season to lead the Ancient Eight, while a trio of guards in sophomore Matthue Cotton, junior Jalen Gabbidon, and senior Eric Monroe are each hovering at the .400 mark in both field goal and three-point percentage.
“As of late they have found a nice rhythm and I think this year is very impressive [given] how much they lost from a year ago,” said Amaker in referring to the departures of current NBA rookie Miye Oni, guards Alex Copeland and Trey Phills, as well as big man Blake Reynolds. “The kid Atkinson on the inside, is giving them solid consistent play. I've always thought that the Monroe kid at the point guard position…he's been a game manager. He hadn't been the guy that you need to go get 20 points, but what he does he makes all the right decisions and gets everybody involved, and he just he's solid and smart.”
While the Crimson relinquished its eight-game win streak this past weekend, its Fridays foes are on a six-game spurt of its own, having easily handled Columbia and Cornell at home this past weekend with a combined margin of victory of 46 points. Against the Big Red, Swain converted on six triples as part of a 25-point night. The interior-minded Atkinson, who leads the team with 17.1 points per game, also impressed with a 24-point outing.
Prior to last weekend, the Bulldogs swept its series over Brown with two double-digit victories. The Bears, outside of losing wing Desmond Cambridge to transfer, retain much of its veteran core including its shifty point guard Brandon Anderson and reliable finishers Tamenang Choh and Zach Hunsaker. Brown also took care of business against the Lions and Big Red, and hold identical 2-2 records with the Crimson. Having dropped to the Bears last season at Providence, Harvard cannot discount this match by any capacity.
“I think they're athletic enough to match up with us,” Amaker said. “They made a point of emphasis of recruiting in that direction the last few years to get better and more athletic and they've done it….we talked about regrouping and responding and I’m anxious to see how we're going to do that.”
The Crimson will need to carry forth another weekend with the status of star point guard Bryce Aiken in flux, as no official update has been provided as to the extent of his ankle injury. Offensively, Harvard’s conference offensive numbers — outside of three-point shooting — have been a tad below its season averages. That said, the scoring production of key players who must shoulder Aiken’s load, including seniors Juzang, Bassey, and Chris Lewis, have all gone up so far in Ancient Eight play.
Much of that scoring however (particularly in the past two contests) have come in the face of considerable deficits, something that the Crimson can ill-afford to stomach for another two games.

As the statistical underdogs on Friday and the targets of a back-to-back home upset on Saturday, the Crimson are in for another team-testing weekend. At the very minimum, some resemblance of momentum will be sought after as it awaits a return to Lavietes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In front of passionate home crowds in the Malkin Athletic Center, Harvard wrestling (1-8, 1-5 EIWA) dropped two difficult matches against league rivals Princeton and Penn.
Up against the 16th-ranked Tigers on Friday night, the Crimson was energized and showed no signs of backing down. Harvard found itself down early after a clinical performance from Princeton’s Pat Glory, number three in the nation at 125 pounds, who started off the evening with a pin. In the third match, however, Junior Lukus Stricker came up with a major victory, coming from behind in the final period to beat Princeton’s Marshall Keller 8-6. Senior Aaron Kruk followed him up by holding on for a tight 3-1 victory at 149 to bring the match to 9-6.
With a chance to tie the match, senior captain Hunter Ladnier took the mat to face Quincy Monday, the fourth-best 157-pounder in the country.
“That was a big match,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “It didn’t start out great - Hunter got down, but he just kept at it. That was one of the best matches I’ve seen Hunter wrestle.”
Late in the third period, with Monday barely clinging to a lead and appearing fatigued, Princeton challenged a takedown near the edge of the mat, giving Monday an extra two points, and — more importantly — a chance to rest. Ladnier scored a late takedown to bring the score within one, but ran out of time, losing 9-8. Tempers flared, with one Crimson coach yelling and shoving his finger in the direction of the Princeton bench, but the Tigers had already secured a six point cushion, a lead they wouldn’t give up for the rest of the match.
Harvard’s pair of Freshman phenoms, No. 17 165 Phil Conigliaro — a Massachusetts native wrestling in front of a number of his high school coaches and teammates — and No. 10 Heavyweight Yaraslau Slavikowsi, took care of business as usual, each securing comfortable decisions. Princeton nonetheless pulled away for a 27-12 victory.
The next night against Penn, Stricker almost secured another big win for the Crimson to start things off, but the Quakers’ 19th-ranked 141 Doug Zapf stole a 3-2 win in the final seconds. Penn secured a major decision in the 149 bout, but a strong 14-1 major from Ladnier followed by a comfortable 11-4 victory for Conigliaro tied the match at 7-7. The Crimson continued to stay within arms length thanks to wins by Mike Doggett and Slavikowski. But with Harvard down by six and needing wins in its final two bouts to avoid the loss, Penn’s national No. 8 125 Michael Colaiocco proved to be too much, earning a major decision that put the Crimson away for good.
It has been a season of ups and downs so far for the Crimson. The team has racked up three individual tournament wins (two from Conigliaro and one from Ladnier) and 17 top-eight finishes overall, and posted an impressive team showing at the prestigious Midlands Tournament, finishing 15th in a field of 35 that included five of the top ten teams in the nation and ten of the top 25.
But Harvard has also found wins hard to come by in dual meets, hobbled by injuries and unable to compete with the deep lineups of some of the best teams in the nation, like No. 4 Arizona State and No. 11 Iowa State. Despite its losing record, the Crimson have reason to feel optimistic about their year thanks to the starpower of a team built for postseason tournaments.
“Our young guys are competing hard and at a high level, obviously with two guys ranked in the top 15, but I think there’s more to it,” Weiss said. We’re obviously a better tournament team, just with our lineup the way it is right now… I like where we’re at.”
With a weekend off from competition coming up, Harvard is in the midst of their most difficult week of training as they look forward to finishing the dual season strong and delivering at EIWAs. But their season likely won’t end there; in Conigliaro and Slavikowski, they have a chance to make a splash on college wrestling’s biggest stage.
“The goal is obviously to win a title, to place in the NCAA tournament, to be an All-American,” Weiss said. “That’s on their mind for sure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Friday night’s matchup between the Harvard men’s hockey team and Dartmouth, the prettiest goal turned out to be the most important one.
Five minutes into the second period, a settled offensive sequence culminated in a tic-tac-toe play, nabbing the game-winner for the No. 17 Crimson (11-7-4, 9-4-3 ECAC).
Junior rearguard Reilly Walsh controlled the puck at the point. The offensive defenseman worked it down low to sophomore center Jack Drury, who one-touched it across the crease to freshman Nick Abruzzese. The winger wasted no time putting home his squad’s third of the night.
Courtesy of Abruzzese's tuck, the Big Green (10-9-4, 7-7-2) saw its winless streak progress to five games as it suffered a season sweep at the hands of its Ivy League adversary, to the tune of 6-2. With the victory, Harvard becomes just the second team in 2019-2020 to leave Thompson Arena with two points.
“They’re an older team, they’re experienced, they’re well-coached,” sophomore blue-liner Marshall Rifai said. “Especially coming off a Beanpot loss, the guys were really chomping at the bit to get back in games and get a win. We felt pretty confident in our group, and we knew we needed these two points.”
At the 14-minute mark of the third stanza, Dartmouth halved its two-goal deficit. Upperclassman forwards Collin Rutherford, Matt Baker, and Daniel Warpecha combined to find the back of the net. Warpecha was the culprit, firing a high shot past Harvard net-minder Mitchell Gibson (2 GA, .917 SV%) to finish off an impressive transition play.
The claw-back goal made things interesting for the next ten minutes, but none other than Drury and Abruzzese combined to restore Harvard’s two-score cushion at 4-2, snuffing the Big Green’s comeback attempt.
The first forward line’s performance extended Drury’s point streak to ten games. During this span — which was interrupted by Drury’s stint at the IIHF World Junior Championship — the second-year forward has compiled 20 points (11–9—20). He has steadily climbed the Division-I ranks and is now second nationwide in points per game (1.53).
Abruzzese, meanwhile, is putting together an excellent rookie campaign, having flanked Drury for most of the season. The Slate Hill, N.Y. native has inked the scoresheet in all but four of his 22 appearances in 2019-2020. He currently paces all NCAA freshmen in points per game (1.36) and assists per game (0.86).
“[Abruzzese] is an incredible player,” said Drury, deflecting all the credit. “His vision, his skating, his hands are all incredible. He understands how to play give-and-go hockey. He’s one of the best passers I’ve ever seen…. It’s been nice to at least find a little chemistry this year.”
An empty-net goal from freshman forward John Farinacci and a garbage-time tally — but an even-strength notch nonetheless — from captain Nathan Krusko gave the scoreboard its lopsided appearance by the final horn.
“It was a close, hard-fought game,” Drury said. “I don’t think the score really reflects how the game actually played out. It was a one-goal game until five or six minutes left…. We know we can be better, but we’re happy with how we stayed composed and stuck to our structured gameplan.”
Harvard took a 2-1 lead into the dressing room after 20 minutes. A critical five-minute major penalty from Dartmouth captain Brendan Demler gifted an extended powerplay to the nation’s best man-up unit (30.9% effective).
Demler’s illegal hit on sophomore blue-liner Jack Rathbone came toward the tail end of a Big Green minor penalty. Thus, the task of outlasting a non-releasable, five-minute Crimson powerplay was made even more daunting given the fatigue of the Dartmouth penalty killers.
The Big Green held strong for the first three and a half minutes of the ensuing major. Then, Harvard cashed in, thanks to the second man-advantage unit.
Gliding along the blue line, Rifai rung a wrist shot off the crossbar. The puck initially stayed out but lingered near the front of the net, where freshman forward Austin Wong tapped it in.
The Crimson has converted with the extra man in all but four tilts this season.
“That first [powerplay] unit gets a lot of attention because they’re so good, and we have so much talent,” said Rifai, who logged his first career multi-point performance on Friday. “But people forget how deep our team is…. I think our staff is confident with both units. It was great to take a little pressure off that first unit, to score that goal and go ahead late [in the first period].”
Wong’s lamp-lighter ends a 10-game dry spell after the rookie potted his first collegiate goal in his debut — he was sidelined due to injury for the Crimson’s first 10 outings of 2019-2020.
The powerplay tally thrust Harvard back into the lead, as the frame had already seen the Ivy League rivals exchange blows.
Three minutes after the opening puck drop, junior Jack Badini kicked off the scoring with a demonstration of his speed. In the neutral zone, the centerman poked the puck around senior forward Will Graber and was off to the races, in alone on senior goaltender Adrian Clark (5 GA, .815 SV%). Badini tucked it under the bar with a clean finish on his backhand.
The Anaheim Ducks prospect’s fifth of the year marks the 16th time in 22 contests that the Crimson has scored first this season, a testament to the group’s ability to impose its potent offense early. Harvard sits second in the NCAA in first-period goals per game (1.27).
The visitors’ lead was short-lived, though. Four minutes after Badini’s strike, sophomore forward Drew O’Connor buried a feed from junior linemate Quin Foreman to equalize. Foreman gained possession below the goal line, found some space, and shoveled a backhand pass toward the blue paint, where O’Connor sent the puck past Gibson.
“Badini had a great individual effort there,” Rifai recalled. “He showed his speed and got us on the board, and there was a lot of life on the bench. I feel like maybe we got a little complacent, and we paid for it. We lost a guy in front, and they scored. But guys on the bench responded really well. We knew right away that we were going to get the next one.”
The Crimson pauses its conference slate briefly to finish off this year’s Beanpot Tournament. Unfortunately for this group, that means playing in the dreaded “early game,” or Monday’s consolation matchup ahead of the finale later that night.
Harvard will be battling No. 4 Boston College in a rematch of early December’s 3-2 Eagles victory — despite the lack of stakes attached, both an important game for the Pairwise rankings and a measuring-stick affair for a group with postseason aspirations. A positive result could orient the team in the right direction as it braces for the home stretch of the campaign.

Shopping week has come to a close and you should no longer be dependent on my.harvard, unless you’re starting to realize you signed up for 60 hours of work a week and are frantically searching for easier classes. Whether this is your current situation or you’re already bracing yourself to game the system next semester, here are some useful tips to deal with this perennial problem.
Take Deep Breaths
Inhale. Exhale. Take a moment to process your annoyance. Remember, you don’t have to send an angry email which will be read by an employee who’s not at fault — but we didn’t say you shouldn’t draft an emotional social media post. Make sure you check that your device is connected to WiFi or an ethernet cable before acting rashly.
Phone a Friend
Ask your friends if they are experiencing similar problems or if they know when a GenEd or a gem is meeting. It is also a good idea to check the HUIT website in case there are any scheduled site repairs. If this is to no avail, it might be worth refreshing the site every 10 minutes instead of every 10 seconds. Your time is valuable.
Pretend Like Internet Doesn’t Exist
If it seems like you’ll just have to wait it out, reflect on anything you could have done to prevent technical difficulties in the first place. Before school starts, download the Course Catalog PDF so you can peruse classes offline. Make a mental note to check class locations days, weeks, or, preferably, months in advance of the start of term instead of the night before.
Take the HUIT784 Shuttle down to HQ
This is the part when you step into the shoes of your favorite literary rebel and storm the fortress: HUIT headquarters at 784 Memorial Drive. Gather your fellow comrades and head to Lamont to catch the HUIT shuttle (or march down the Charles in case the shuttle is down too). In the case of bureaucratic hurdles or a simple loss in resolve, hop on over to Trader Joe’s and treat yourself to some comfort snacks. You deserve it after all you have been through.
Sites crash sometimes and it’s frustrating. Luckily, you can beat the system, and chances are you won’t have to look far for a sympathetic ear.
