After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yan Lianke’s “The Four Books” is set in The Three Years of Great Chinese Famine, when Mao Zedong’s unrealistic goals for economic growth led to the devastation of natural resources and agricultural produce and the starvation of millions. Despite the fact that significant literary works on this history exist, notably “Woman from Shanghai,” it remains a sensitive topic for Chinese authors. In fact, “The Four Books” is not published in its home country. Like many of his recent novels, it was banned by the Chinese censors for being too politically satirical. However, contrary to what readers might expect, Yan Lianke does not focus on making accusations over what happened during the Great Leap Forward. By blurring his novel’s historical context and adding religious elements, Yan creates a harrowing work that addresses the more universal topic of collective human madness.
Yan’s book, to that end, is full of absurd, surreal, and often disturbing plots and figures. His main characters are nameless, referred to only by their original profession—Writer, Scholar, Musician, Theologian—and clearly meant to represent social types. They labor in the 99th Re-Education district, a self-sustained community where people from around the country have been sent to work, and a cold-hearted ruler called the Child presides over them. As his name suggests, the Child uses power crudely. Instead of intimidating his workers by threatening to kill them, he constantly asks his inferiors to kill him whenever they dispute with him. Of course, they never do.
The book employs a lot of religious references, often giving the absent central government the sense of an omnipotent yet incompetent god. This is definitely a brave approach for a writer in Yan’s situation. It is easy to just exploit the historical events that always come in handy, but it is more challenging for the author to abstract them and create another dimension of reality by himself. In this regard alone, “The Four Books” should be celebrated for its originality.
Yan not only takes a novel approach to his topic but also builds upon a delicate and imaginative structure. The book actually consists of four fictional “books,” each of which recounts the events in the Re-Education district differently. “Heaven’s Child” is a third-person narrative that mainly focuses on the Child, “Past Course” is a journal kept by the Writer in the district, “Criminal Record” is a report of misbehaviors in the district that the Writer was asked to write, and “A New Myth of Sisyphus” is an essay by the Scholar. “Heaven’s Child” largely employs a Biblical style that puts the Child in juxtaposition with the Christian God. Its opening is a great example of this: “The great earth and the mortal path returned together…… The houses in the Re-Education district parted the heavens and split the earth.” Soon the Child arrives to announce “ten commandments, the tenth of which is Thou shalt not flee, Thou shalt follow the rules and regulations, and those who flee will receive a certificate.” This touch of religious elements both emphasizes the absolute power of the Child and compares the blinded Great Leap Forward movement to a radical, almost incomprehensible religious craze, giving a frightening sense of absurdity, similar to that found in Franz Kafka’s writings. Yan himself calls this “mythological realism.” He abandons apparent logical and sequential relationships, effectively using myths, dreams, and projects to explore the terrible reality which exists not only in the physical world of China but also in the soul of man.
“Past Course,” the second “book,” is particularly maddening in its detached, realistic style of reporting horrors. Yan paints vivid portraits of workers in the Re-Education district, both victims of and active participants in the movement. They report false reports of agricultural produce and go out at night in search of couples secretly engaged in trysts. Hoping to report the couples and get rewards, swarms of people prowl in the dark. Towards the end, they even start to eat one another. In contrast to that of “Heaven’s Child,” the tone in this “book” is extremely calm and objective. This actually amplifies the effect of the story, because it leaves more space for readers to imagine all the horrors, especially given the fact that many events in the book actually took place in history. In 1957, the Chinese government started “people's communes,” which were essentially the same with the Re-Educational district in “The Four Books.” To meet the ridiculous objective assigned by the government, many communes gave hugely exaggerated reports of their produce, requisitioned pots and pans to supply the "scrap" for the furnaces, or handed in peasants’ food rations as their “grain production”. The Writer critically narrates these insanities in "Past Course," but he himself, in the following section “Criminal Records,” tries to fawn to higher-ups by making groundless accusations.
Although this unique structure of “The Four Books” magnifies the power of its story, it is not without its problems. Dividing a book into four smaller ones can look like a stunt to make the story seemingly more complex than it is, and Yan’s transitions between different books are not always smooth. Additionally, the religious language in "Heaven’s Child" is often overwrought and distracting. For instance, the expression “so it came to pass,” which appears five times in the first four pages of the book, is definitely more of an obstacle for reading than a stylistic accomplishment. Notably, this problem is actually more marked in the original Chinese text than the English translation, since Yan’s original writing has a lot of incomplete or highly condensed sentences that resonate with the style of the old Chinese translation of the Bible.
“The Four Books” takes an fascinating approach to a daring and interesting subject. Despite some imperfections that come along with its challenging structure, it provides readers with a chance to both revisit a horrible page of Chinese history and a meditation on universal human madness.

The sentient robot is a revered tradition in science fiction, going all the way back to the 1920 Czech play “R.U.R.” in which the word “robot” was invented. Tradition does not stand on its own, however, as illustrated by Neill Blomkamp’s new film, “Chappie.” “Chappie” tries to shoulder the mantle of ethically concerned speculative fiction, but its manic pacing and incoherent jumble of plotlines prevent it from ever rising above a garbled cheer for transhumanism.
In the extreme near future, a robotic police force designed by Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) is introduced to the post-apartheid hell of Johannesburg, South Africa, resulting in a dramatic reduction in crime. When Wilson, under threats from a small gang of criminals (Ninja and Yolandi Visson of Die Antwoord, playing under their own names), installs an artificial intelligence onto one of the robot bodies, it becomes Chappie (Sharlto Copley), and chaos ensues.
The writing (by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell) is generally bad. Characters are introduced to serve a single function, with little actual development. Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman), Wilson’s co-worker, is nothing but a cartoonishly villainous rival. Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver), president of Wilson’s company, merely serves to frustrate Wilson and give Moore free rein on the way to the film’s denouement. Ninja is a snarling, ill-humored gangster; Yolandi is a sweet mother-figure. Chappie is an innocent punching-bag. The plot can be charitably described as one damned thing after another. Wilson types furiously at his computer and suddenly he has invented an AI; Chappie types furiously at a computer and, within 20 seconds of screen time, he has “solved consciousness”; Moore plugs an external drive into a computer and suddenly he has a program that can shut down the entire robot police force. This is a movie that simply tries to put too much material into 120 minutes and so spends no more than a few minutes on each plot point—an approach that leaves much wanting in the story.
Given the writing, it is no wonder that the performances are heavy-handed and wooden at best. Hugh Jackman spends most of his time on screen snarling or laughing evilly, two activities that can only be given so much histrionic subtlety. Patel’s Wilson shows that he is naive and well intentioned and very smart by smiling and crushing cans of Red Bull. Copley’s Chappie gambols to show that he is innocent and mumbles to show that he is embittered, with very little modulation between these two modes. Ninja spits and shouts to show that he is violent; Yolandi coos and murmurs to show that she is nurturing.
The cinematography matches the writing. The inevitable shaky cam accompanies action and sweeping aerial shots of Johannesburg set scenes. There are enough explosions and enough robotic fight sequences, punctuated by melodramatic slow-motion, to draw the drooling herds who make Michael Bay wealthier by the year. Cuts are jarring and fast enough to keep the viewer from ever quite figuring out all of what he or she is seeing.
By all standards, “Chappie” is quite a disappointment. It contributes nothing new to the genre of science fiction, and it contributes nothing good to the medium of cinema. It is so fast-paced and so shallow in its treatment of even the most interesting and challenging themes—death, consciousness, playing God, human nature, the increasing place of technology in our lives, the surveillance state—that it is, in some way, a perfect treatment of the information age’s approach to life and the big questions: twitchy, excited, and devoid of grandeur or even coherence. It is curious, but not curious enough to take the time to learn. No doubt “Chappie” will attract many who do not find any odium in this way of life. For everyone else, there is still “Blade Runner.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last summer, the controversy surrounding sexual assault on college campuses came to Congress when a group of senators proposed a bill that would regulate how publicly funded colleges managed sexual assault. The legislation, known as the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, cited a study that found that 41 percent of surveyed colleges had conducted no sexual assault investigations over the last five years. Among other provisions, the bill mandated the yearly release of campus surveys and the hiring of “confidential advisors” to hear student concerns. Media coverage, however, did not correspond to political popularity, and the bill was never enacted.
Sexual assault has, of course, far from disappeared since then. Last week, the defeated legislation resurfaced with the majority of its provisions intact, including the one requiring confidential advisors, but also some notable changes. In particular, the new bill altered the yearly requirement of a campus survey to a biennial one, demanded that involved parties learn of disciplinary investigations within 24 hours, and specified that non-compliant institutions could face fines up to one percent of their operating budgets.
The seriousness of this drive for national legislation matches the seriousness of the situation. According to one widely cited report, an estimated one in five women are sexually assaulted during their time at college. University students report around 5,000 forcible sex offenses per year; another 25,000 are believed to go unreported. Sexual assault is a national problem and consequently deserves a national solution.
Title IX regulations fill part of this need. The landmark legislation obligated colleges to have a formal disciplinary procedure, act without delay in the case of a complaint, and provide formal hearings. While these requirements are certainly positive, the persistence of unreported sexual assaults illustrates that Title IX is not enough.
Certain components of the Campus Accountability and Safety Act are desirable supplements to Title IX. Specifically, the call for campus surveys and frequent statistics would help colleges address the issue by spotlighting areas of systemic weakness.
But the bill overreaches by specifying strict deadlines for each measure. Enforcing biennial surveys with the threat of major financial penalties reflects a stubborn posture that is unwilling to give institutions adequate autonomy. This additional oversight would prevent a university from tailoring sexual assault measures most effectively to its individual campus cultures. Universities may, for example, need more time to design and administer surveys that capture the viewpoints of as many students as possible as accurately as possible.
Ultimately, the federal government should not be determining an exact policy that all colleges must adopt. Instead, Congress must work to ensure that each institution both meets necessary benchmarks, and has enough room to craft individual policies that reflect the culture and problems of its campus. While the legislation currently on offer is well intentioned and contains several laudable ideas, it falls short due to its overly rigid requirements. Congress should not rest here, but rather should strive to develop legislation that both establishes appropriate, enforceable requirements for colleges and allows those institutions some freedom within those constraints.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I fancy myself a feminist—an equal-pay supporting, microaggression loathing, Gloria Steinem fanboying feminist. But last week, when a girl I bought dinner for paid me back on the mobile application, Venmo, I felt completely emasculated. Why? Because, clearly, I’m misogynistic.
Does wanting to pay for a girl’s dinner really make me a misogynist? No, I’m being reductive—of course it doesn’t. It makes me a “chivalrous” college freshman. And, in many ways, that’s worse. By inadvertently promoting the idea that men should feel the need to carry the economic weight for women—and in turn perpetuating the patriarchy in the hopes of being a gentleman—I’m disrespecting the girl I went out with. But worse, by insisting that I pay for dinner, I’m also chipping away at the progress women in America have achieved over the last hundred years in proving themselves financially independent.
Growing up I was taught that—along with holding open doors and putting my coat down over puddles—grabbing the check at dinner is the ultimate sign of chivalry. And so, ever since middle school, I’ve been doing just that. And in my admittedly privileged New York City high school, this was the norm. Save for a few instances of girls demanding to pay guys back for dinner—in one case an awesome girl named Lydia went as far as to sneakily insert a $20 bill into my friend’s wallet—this vestige of a male-dominant society persisted, even in my liberal, blue-state friend group.
But for a variety of reasons, this seemingly innocent, even polite, gesture on the part of men accentuates and promotes some of society’s most pernicious gender norms. After all, in a world where a man somehow feels less “manly” because he didn’t pay for dinner, can we really expect him to be content marrying a woman who earns more money than him down the road? If splitting dinner is really a castrating experience for a man, will he be fine with his wife taking charge of the mortgage payment? And if parents continue to teach their daughters that their dinners should be paid for, will the next generation of women genuinely believe they are capable of being a family’s top earner?
I’m not sure, and that’s the problem.
On the one hand, I wish that paying for dinner were viewed in the same light as holding open doors and buying someone a gift for Valentine’s Day, if only to prove that I’ve learned nothing from Economics 10b about savings. On the other, I recognize that this desire probably comes at least partially from a subconscious self-preservation instinct designed to maintain the patriarchy. And, whereas holding open doors, putting coats over puddles (who really does this one, by the way?), and exchanging gifts are gestures that take some thought, buying dinner is nothing but a financial statement—a demonstration of privilege.
Luckily, with the advent of Venmo, paying for dinner is no longer in a man’s control anyway, even if he physically asserts himself by grabbing the check. Women now have the power to pay men back on a digital, public forum, be it instantly or several months down the road, and have it show up in the news feeds of all of their friends. It might cost a little bit of Venmo cash in the short term, but ultimately, when men and women are both seen as financially essential to the success of a relationship, it will more than pay off.
Now, am I arguing that Venmo is some kind of magic cure to gender inequality in America? No, I’m not. And I acknowledge that this article takes a narrow and heterocentric view on gender dynamics in today’s society by sensationalizing the potential impact of splitting the bill and by unnecessarily putting the onus of doing so on women. But I do think the question of who should pay for dinner is a microcosm for the larger problem of men, both intentionally and unintentionally, working to preserve their place of financial power.
Besides, dudes, if you can get over your fear of emasculation, not only will society be much better off for it, but so will your Venmo account. And isn’t that what really matters? (Hint: it’s not.)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We were transplanting a row of eggplant as quickly as we could, trying to finish before it got too hot. With one hand, Jake was placing seedlings a foot away from each other with uncanny precision and with the other he was stopping Maggie the dog from prancing all over them. I was right behind them covering the roots with soil, crawling on my stomach along the furrow like a soldier through a trench.
Jake usually got philosophical when we transplanted—it probably had something to do with the wealth of intrigue offered by the task of putting plants into dirt. So I saw it coming when he asked me about halfway down the furrow about my thoughts on vegetarianism. Without looking up, I recited the religious and cultural implications of eating meat for certain people, talked about the potential health benefits, and said something about as vague and unsubstantiated as, “It’s the ethical thing to do.” He didn’t say anything for a while. But Jake was a high school teacher first and a farmer second, and his instincts as the former must have kicked in.
“Ever hear of the Siberian fox experiment?” he asked.
He told me, once he saw my blank face, about research that sounded like it came out of a science fiction novel. Against the backdrop of Soviet totalitarianism, scientist Dmitriy Belyaev attempted to recreate the evolution of wolves into dogs in a secret laboratory in some unexplored recess of Siberia. He and his team bred silver foxes, a cousin to the dog that had never been domesticated before, over multiple generations, selecting for traits like approachability and friendliness around humans.
After mere decades, Belyaev did what previously thought took millennia. Fourth generation foxes started showing the behavioral traits of tameness like wagging their tails and jumping into the laps of researchers. They also had what researchers call the “domestication phenotype”—physiological characteristics like floppier ears, curlier tails, and spottier coats. More strikingly, foxes born to aggressive mothers, but nurtured by tame ones, were nonetheless aggressive. Fifty years later, scientists continue his work, providing even more compelling evidence of the previously unthinkable—certain animals may be genetically predisposed to human contact, to domesticity.
Domesticity is a concept that’s difficult to precisely define, but at its core, it is the modification of animals over multiple generations for human benefit. The most prevalent use of domesticated animals is to produce meat, an exercise that many proponents of ethical vegetarianism take issue with on the grounds that since animals are sentient beings of similar moral value to humans, rearing and killing them cannot be justified. The doctrine of animal liberationism, defined by people like Peter Singer and organizations like PETA, distinguishes humans from the rest of the Animal Kingdom only in one regard: moral agency, which compels us to right our wrongs and to stop exploiting the farm animal.
But what Belyaev’s research demonstrates—an idea that took a lot of time for me to accept after Jake introduced it to me—is that historically, there have been more factors than just human intention in the process that has given us the beef steer and the broiler chicken. The ancestor of many of the animals we consider food species like pigs, cattle, and sheep derived much of their evolutionary competitiveness from mutations that caused them to be less afraid of humans, presenting an opportunity for humans to engage in symbiotic husbandry. Natural selection preceded artificial selection. At the risk of sounding reductive, farm animals were made to be farmed.
Animal liberationists conflate sentience with moral value, oversimplifying the similarity between meat animals and humans and mischaracterizing human moral agency. Animals and humans are fundamentally and genetically different, and the moral responsibility of the human to animals exists only insofar as the need to care for them well. This human prerogative however cannot be overstated. Environmentalist Wendell Berry sets a good standard in his essay “The Pleasures of Eating” for responsible eating practices: “If I am going to eat meat,” he wrote, “I want it to be from an animal that has lived a pleasant, uncrowded life outdoors, on bountiful pasture, with good water nearby and trees for shade.”
Industrial or otherwise intensive farms, however, produce most of the meat Americans eat by cruelly confining animals to inhabitable enclosures and slaughtering them in ways that yield inconceivable pain. Cows spend most of their lives walking knee-deep in their own waste. Chicken are fed and drugged until their breasts are so large that they spend the latter part of their lives keeled over. To that end, ethical vegetarians are only guilty of erring on the side of caution, refusing to be implicated in a process that is morally unacceptable regardless of the genetic origins of domesticity.
Man’s control of the land is his crowning achievement. He revolutionized the human diet by domesticating the plant and to the extent he was involved in domesticating the animal, he did so justifiably. Jake didn’t change my eating practices in just one day. No, that would be a pedagogical nightmare. But he did accomplish what I think he wanted to. He challenged me to substantiate and eventually redefine my claims on ethical prudence. And more importantly, he made me thankful for gifts of nature and conversations like these.

Liberalism ain’t what it used to be—collectivism is out and individuality is in. And this is especially true for our generation.
The common joke among Harvard students and faculty is that our community is an unashamed bastion of liberalism (and by liberalism, we all mean classic American FDR-style liberalism, not the European libertarian brand). Just last week, one of my professors joked: “You all attend Harvard, so we already know what party you’re voting for.” And I don’t disagree. Most Harvard students would, in fact, label themselves Democrats. Many will vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. So aren’t all these people liberals? What is our “liberalism problem”?
Let’s begin with a common phrase I hear around Harvard’s campus: “I’m socially liberal, but fiscally conservative.” The number of people who subscribe to this division of political affinities seems to grow by the day. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that there is a growing number of young democratic voters who are skeptical of economic redistribution and “the cost of social programs”  and believe much more strongly in the importance of issues of personal and sexual autonomy, like same-sex marriage and abortion.
But where does one draw the line between social and fiscal policies? Is eliminating the wage gap between men and women an economic problem that should be left to the market to fix? Or is it a social problem that requires government intervention to correct for the imperfections of the market?
We have grown up in an age of diminishing trust in the public sector and growing admiration for all things private. As Andrew Kohut of the Pew Center said in an interview with Thomas Edsall: “There is a libertarian streak that is apparent among these left-of-center young people. Socially liberal, but very wary of government. Why? They came of age in an anti-government era…They are very liberal on interpersonal racial dimension, but reject classical liberal notions about ways of achieving social progress for minorities.”
In other words, the millennial generation has begun to lose its respect for the public sector and focus more on the power of the individual to shape our political goals. This infatuation with individuality has caused a fundamental shift in the nature of our liberalism.
One of the major justifications for this newfound focus on the individual is the use of “identity politics” to frame our political discourse. By identity politics, I mean how specific experiences, those of ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation, are used as a lens through which to view our political life. Somewhere along the way (many historians including Tony Judt point to the ‘60s as a starting point) progressivism became associated with identity politics.
Identity politics, however, in its original formulation, was about group identities—for example, the identity of black men or gay men—so it had some collective ideology behind it. Much of this collectivism has been twisted into identity brands used for the purpose of self-expression, rather than collective action to better oppressed groups. In other words, today’s identity politics has been co-opted by a sense of capitalist individualism that is harmful to the very groups that identity politics was originally created to protect.
In a recent op-ed for the New York Times, Thomas Chatterton Williams voiced this new relationship between identity and individuality perfectly: “If ‘black lives matter’ genuinely, then we must recognize minority individuality: Black people should pursue their own opportunities for the good life wherever they can.” And this idea is pervasive in almost every iteration of individualistic identity rhetoric.
The real problem with today’s distorted identity politics is that, as Thomas de Zengotita argues in his essay “Common Ground,” our devotion to individual identity has allowed us to ignore the Enlightenment values for which progressivism has always stood: Namely, that each life is inherently equal. The emphasis has shifted from equality to individuality.
And this really gets to the heart of it: Our desire for individual self-expression has always come naturally from the idea that we must appreciate the equality of identities. This is not the case in today’s version of identity politics.
In his book, “Ill Fares the Land,” Tony Judt argues that, in a modern society obsessed with the individual, we have increasingly lost our sense of community.
To use one of Judt’s examples most relevant to my own life, this new identity politics has led many to eschew community markers, like school uniforms. My own K-12 school, a self-proclaimed progressive school, prided itself on its lack of school uniforms and taught us that we were able to better express ourselves as individuals with our freedom to dress how we please. I grew up loving my uniform-less schooling. But what I saw as independence was a way to divide a student body by socioeconomic markers that come with the clothing that one student can afford and another cannot. As Judt says, uniforms, whether worn by schoolchildren or other workers, always “bespoke a certain egalitarianism.”
The growing emphasis on self-expression, self-interest, and self-advancement now inherent in identity politics has manifested itself across the Harvard campus. There seems to be an ever-growing desire for private sector jobs, and I am not the first to make this observation.
More than just the mainstream consulting and financial services jobs, we are obsessed with the new industries that seem to nurture the individual’s ingenuity and a sense of the entrepreneurial spirit, like the tech world. Many graduates who used to take jobs at Goldman Sachs are now joining the teams at Google and Microsoft.
The symbol of our generation’s infatuation with this new world of privatized glory is Steve Jobs—a man who has seemingly been given the title of national hero. I am not here to diminish the accomplishments of a truly talented man. But is this unadulterated admiration for a man like Jobs warranted? Where is our admiration for the career civil servant or the teacher, who spent her entire professional life struggling to help kids in an underserved neighborhood in East Harlem or Detroit?
This is not to say that new identity politics is all bad. We are, after all, an incredibly open-minded generation. We are ever mindful of nurturing the individual. But we must ask ourselves, at what cost? Have we given up on the values of collectivism? Has our disillusion with the inefficiencies in government led us to give up on the idea of a collective, public good altogether?
The concern ultimately becomes, as Judt writes, that when “young people are encouraged to maximize self-interest and self-advancement, the grounds for altruism or even good behavior become obscured.” This is our liberalism problem. The next move is ours.

Shaun R. Harper, University of Pennsylvania professor and the Office of Student Life’s inaugural “Scholar-in-Residence,” addressed Harvard in particular as he advocated for “intentional” institutional support as a means of increasing inclusivity on college campuses.
In his talk at the Fong Auditorium on Thursday evening, Harper, whose research focuses on the experiences of minority students on college campuses, said that colleges with diverse populations like Harvard often lack cross-group interactions and meaningful inclusion because administrators believe in “magical thinking.”
“We define [magical thinking] as the assumption that powerful educational outcomes will be automatically manufactured through student-initiated engagement with peers who are different,” Harper said.
He added that if administrators and faculty want to create an inclusive campus, it is their responsibility to create programs that support minority students and encourage dialogue.
Harper also spoke specifically about inclusivity at Harvard.
Harper said that the Harvard students he has encountered have consistently expressed a need for more welcoming spaces. According to Harper, while Houses have the potential to foster inclusivity, they cannot do so successfully without “a high degree” of intentionality from administrators, he said.
He also said he found the location of Harvard’s diversity offices—the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Women’s Center, and the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations—in various basements in the Yard “troubling.”
“It rendered me speechless… The space signals that its work is institutionally unimportant,” Harper said in regards to the Foundation, which is located at the basement of Thayer.
Harper said that, because many Ivy League graduates go on to hold positions of power,  institutions like Harvard “absolutely” have a special responsibility to foster inclusive campuses.
Avik Chatterjee, resident tutor in Dunster and a student at the School of Public Health, said that he appreciated hearing concrete examples of programs that Harvard’s peer institutions had implemented to foster a more inclusive campus and increase awareness of diversity issues.
One of the examples that Harper cited was the development of a class at the University of California, Los Angeles to help black male students acclimate. He also discussed programming at cultural centers and cross-culture houses at Stanford.
The talk, which was attended by mostly administrators and graduate students, is one of the many events Harper will be attending as part of his two-day visit to the College as this year’s “Scholar-in-Residence.” Harper will also be meeting with various administrators and students tomorrow.
According to Kimberly A. Truong, an Equity, Diversity & Inclusion visiting administrative fellow and an organizer of Harper’s visit, the “Scholar-in-Residence” program aims to “bridge academic engagement with social and personal engagement.”
While Truong’s fellowship appointment lasts only one year, she said the Office of Student Life hopes to make the selection and visit of a “Scholar-in-Residence” an annual event.

UPDATED: March 6, 2015, at 12:46 a.m.
Students in Spanish 126: “Performing Latinidad” processed around Harvard Yard on Thursday morning, hanging signs and quotations on trees and reciting poetry and prose. Through their words and gestures, they sought to discuss issues of identity and to bring the texts from their class to life.
“The words were in the theory and the poetry, and we took them outside,” performance artist  Josefina Báez, who directed the class in its performances, said.
“Latinidad” refers to the shared experiences of Latinos, according to Lorgia H. García Peña, an assistant professor of Romance Languages and Literatures who teaches the course. García Peña said that, for Thursday’s performance, her students formed six groups, with each picking a campus location that it considered important as a living or educational space.
Outside Robinson Hall, four students presented their component of the performance, hanging a string of burlap bags on a cluster of trees. The bags were filled with personal photos, magazine cutouts, and phrases including “I am still here” and “I am my rhythm.”
“I put [in] a lot of stuff dealing with Spanish, Spanglish, and identity,” said Andree M. Franco Vasquez ’17, who labeled her bag with the words “chewing English and spitting Spanish.”
The class, at one point, was led by two students holding a large sign featuring pop artist Jennifer Lopez, which they subsequently placed in front of the statue of John Harvard with a lit candle. Báez invited members of the class to take pictures with the installation.
Inspiration for the poster came from an article on the influence of the image of artists like Lopez on perceptions of Latinos in popular culture, García Peña said.
“The J. Lo piece, I think, is more of...a feminist-type piece,” Jennifer L. Ruiz ’16 said. “A woman’s body shouldn’t just be policed, especially a Latina’s body, should not be just exotified and policed.”
After the stops around the Yard, the class convened in Boylston Hall to perform the last projects, using dance movements and accompanied by a guitar.
“I was really fascinated by the class,” Krystle M.C. Leung ’15, a Spanish 126 student, said. “[The performance was] an art project...really a once in a lifetime experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chancellor of New York City Schools Carmen Fariña discussed some of her key policy objectives, including a controversial proposal to change the admissions process for the city’s highly competitive specialized high schools, at the Graduate School of Education on Thursday evening.
Fariña talked about a need to de-emphasize the role of the Specialized High School Admissions Test in admission to the city’s specialized secondary schools, such as Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science. Fariña also touched upon other new New York City education programs such as universal Pre-K.
She elaborated on her plans to an audience of almost 100, largely composed of participants in the Women in Education Leadership weekend seminar.
Standardized testing in particular sparked much scrutiny from the audience. Once the floor opened up for questions, Max W. Liebeskind ’17, a Stuyvesant High School graduate, stressed the importance of the SHSAT in providing educational opportunities to poor Asian-American students.
Fariña clarified that she did not believe in entirely eliminating the SHSAT, which currently is the only deciding factor of admission in some of the the city’s specialized high schools.
Rather, she emphasized the importance of initiatives such as “DREAM—the Specialized High Schools Institute,” an intensive program for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders intended to better prepare students for both the SHSAT and the academic work to be expected if accepted into one of the eight specialized schools. These types of programs, Fariña said, are often taught by teachers from specialized schools.
Other initiatives that Fariña highlighted at the forum include stronger mental health support in public schools.
“I get emails all the time, and the ones that really upset me the most are when I get one that the child has committed suicide,” she said.
According to Fariña, the New York City Board of Education has hired 200 new guidance counselors. She said she also wishes to hire more social workers who are able to make home visits.
Fariña pointed out the need to hire teachers who understand and can work with children, recalling that, as a superintendent, she ensured that every other teacher she hired was a parent. She said that these teacher-parents understood that “anybody’s child they were teaching could be their own.”
Certain students in the audience spoke of Fariña’s successes. One of the Women in Education Leadership participants thanked Fariña for recently giving students the Muslim holidays Eid al-Firt and Eid al-Adha off of school.

While multiple requests by the defense team of Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, the main suspect in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, to relocate his trial have been denied, some Harvard Law School professors say the defense had legitimate qualms with the trial unfolding in Boston. Lawyers for both sides gave opening statements on Wednesday at the Moakley U.S. Courthouse in Boston.
“If there ever were a case for a change of venue, this is it,” said Nancy Gertner, a faculty member at the Law School and former U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Massachusetts.
Law school professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. attributes the defense’s repeated requests to relocate the trial to the far-reaching impact that the bombing and the subsequent manhunt had on the Boston community.
“The ripple effect of the bombings is so extensive and widespread that just about everybody in the Boston area was either directly or indirectly impacted by the bombing,” Sullivan said.
The repeated relocation motions made by the defense may also have been intended to put pressure on the judge to have a fairer jury selection than he might have otherwise, Gertner said. She added that defense teams with clients facing the death penalty feel an enhanced obligation to ensure the fairest trial possible.
According to Harvard Law School professor Alex Whiting, judges deciding whether or not to relocate a trial must weigh a set of “competing interests.”
“The presumption is that the case will be where the crime occurred unless there is a strong enough showing that it is impossible to have a fair jury,” Whiting said. “Here, both the District Court Judge and the Court of Appeals repeatedly found that the defense had failed to make that showing.”
Despite the broad impact of the bombing on Bostonians, both the district court judge and the appellate court decided that the district court could find an impartial pool of jurors, Sullivan said.
Though neither Sullivan nor Whiting could recall a case where a trial was relocated out of Massachusetts, changing the venue of a high-profile trial is not without precedence. Whiting noted that the Oklahoma City Bombing trial in 1997 was relocated to Denver.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of preparation, thesis writers are pulling their final all-nighters in advance of their last deadlines.
“It’s in a way like a relationship, with its ups and downs,” said Katherine M. Kulik ’15, an inactive Crimson multimedia editor. Bonnie R. Lei ’15 called that relationship “the most intense...ever.”
For many seniors, the looming deadline demands balacing desires for perfection and completion. As the deadline approaches, seniors await edits from their thesis advisers, planning to revise for one last time.
Katharine D. D’Orazio ’15 said she plans to do seven more drafts before her due date next Thursday.
Thesis writers have each identified their most productive writing and revising locations. Veronica Gloria ’15 called herself a “hermit,” remaining in her dorm room with “Do Not Disturb” signs on her door. Daniel R. Ki ’15 said he can work anywhere, including Flyby and the dining halls. Kulik said she finds herself most efficient when sitting on the bench outside of her thesis adviser’s office.
Some thesis writers have reverted to freshman habits. Marina P. Chen ’15 said she spends extended hours in Lamont, while Maddy Berg ’15 said she enjoys the unlimited coffee and food in Annenberg.
Berg, echoed by many other thesis writers, said she had seriously worried about her ability to finish. Writers said that, early on in the process, they feared unexpected events—such as flight cancellations, an emergency surgery, or unreliable study subjects—spelling the end of their theses.
“The whole thing is like a whirlwind,” Berg said. “You are like I’m not going to finish, and then you have a really productive day and you...feel great!”
As lonely as this laptop labor may seem, thesis writing is, according to many seniors, a collective effort. Gloria continues to receive snapchats and sweet messages from the children she interviewed for her thesis on Latino students in suburbs, while Ki described a game he and his blocking group—which includes four thesis writers—play to keep their minds off their theses.
“Every time someone says the word ‘thesis,’ they have to add 50 cents in a swear jar,” said Ki, who now refers to his thesis as “the big document.”
Looking back on the process, Berg feels grateful that she chose to write a thesis.
“It ties up loose ends. As much as there’s drama and tears involved, there’s also so much satisfaction,” she said.
After their deadlines next week, writers will embark on “proper celebration,” Lei said.
Many seniors have planned trips abroad. But Berg said she plans to catch up on sleep and "House of Cards."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council holds general meetings every Sunday that are scheduled to last two hours. Much of that time is spent debating legislation through parliamentary procedure, which stipulates that the Council follow a series of steps before bringing a proposed act to a vote.
At the Council’s general meeting on Feb. 22, a handful of representatives quickly left the room after it took 20 minutes to pass a bill; the week prior, when the meeting was sparsely attended, UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 urged one representative not to leave the room so the Council would not lose quorum for voting on legislation.
These events have not occurred in isolation. According to UC Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, representatives often leave meetings before they are adjourned and spend meeting time on laptops completing schoolwork, suggesting that they are disengaged.
As a result, some members of the Council are questioning the effectiveness of following parliamentary procedure, which they say causes meetings to run too long.
“I’m for it in theory, but it’s tedious in practice,” Nasrollahzadeh said.
‘TEDIOUS IN PRACTICE’
The procedures call for a two-minute opening statement for all legislation, followed by questions, pro-con debate, and finally a vote on the legislation itself. In the case of amendments to legislation, the length of the process doubles because the same steps must occur for the amendment as well.
Currier House representative Stephen A. Turban ’17 ran his campaign for UC leadership alongside Cabot House representative Luke R. Heine ’17 last fall on the platform of abolishing the procedures. Now, as then, Turban said he believes parliamentary procedure should be done away with altogether.
“We exist as a student government, not a real government,” Turban said. “We’re a group of students that are very busy and have different time priorities.”
Council members point to some representatives’ lack of understanding of the procedures to explain why it slows down the process. At its most recent meeting on March 1, as well as meetings prior, the Council has spent a significant portion of time ironing out details of parliamentary procedure to discuss and pass legislation, rather than actually discussing it.
“I, for one, don’t think that parliamentary procedure should be as big of an obstacle as it is,” UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 said.
According to Kanuparthy, representatives should take it upon themselves to learn elements of the procedures to shorten debates and keep conversation flowing.
“It’s honestly very surprising that people don’t realize what’s going on by now,” he added.
“If everyone were comfortable using parliamentary procedure, the meetings would go faster,” Biebelberg agreed.
‘ONE MEMBER, ONE VOTE’
Still, despite shared frustration, some representatives maintain that the procedures are necessary to protect minority voices within the Council. Nasrollahzadeh argued that the procedures are important to enforcing the Council’s “one member, one vote” policy, adding that Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16, the UC’s parliamentarian, has been helpful so far in educating members in the procedures.
“We should structure the conversation so that the minority is guaranteed the right to speak, the right to make a point, the right to push a position that isn’t the most popular,” Kanuparthy said, even though he said he believes that the UC generally discusses material that is relatively non-controversial.
Not all representatives agree, though; Turban suggests the use of parliamentary procedure actually privileges the voices of few.
“You don’t want to give the power in the meetings to the few people who know parliamentary procedure,” he said. “It’s ironic.”
Beyond parliamentary procedure, representatives say that other factors elongate their meetings, including excessive talking and the nature of their meeting space.
“Our meeting space is problematic,” Biebelberg said. The Council currently meets in Ticknor Lounge in Boylston Hall, which Biebelberg said is dimly-lit and polluted with background noise. According to UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the Council is considering moving its meetings to another location, such as Sever Hall or Harvard Hall.
At a more simple level, Kanuparthy said that the amount that members speak at meetings is also at the root of the problem.
“People talk for far, far too long,” Kanuparthy added. “It’s the nature of things that people like to hear themselves talk.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Spee Club issued an apology on Thursday night after it circulated a controversial invitation promoting a party scheduled for Saturday night.
The invitation, which students received over email early Wednesday, advertised a “pajama party” to be held Saturday at the all-male final club's building on Mount Auburn Street. The email included both an image, which appeared to be drawn, and a link to a video hosted on YouTube.
The drawing, titled “Playbear,” depicted a bear wearing a robe, pants, and hat, with its arm around a woman dressed in tights and a sleeveless top. The email linked to a video that included multiple clips of women wearing underwear and male and female models walking a runway, as well as a clip from the song “Stay the Night.” The video, which was previously public on YouTube, was made private and then removed Thursday evening, after it prompted criticism from students and other social club members.
“We would like to apologize for a genuine lapse in judgment regarding Saturday's invitation,” Vince T. Cooper ’15, whose email account sent the invitation, wrote to recipients of the email on Thursday night. “We are sorry that the invitation gave the wrong impression of both our party and our club and made guests feel uncomfortable. It was inappropriate, and we hope that you all know you are encouraged to wear whatever attire you would like.”
In an email to The Crimson, Cooper reiterated his apology and wrote that the Spee hopes to use the incident to engage in broader dialogue with women on campus throughout the semester.
“We sent the wrong message about our party and our club with this invitation, but the issues that have been made more salient as a result are much bigger than this party,” Cooper wrote. “We hope to work with the female final clubs and other women on campus to provide some sort of open forum for them to voice their concerns so we can continue to make our space a comfortable, fun environment.”
The invitation sparked backlash from some students who received it. Savanna M. Arral ’16, who was forwarded the invitation, said she believes its portrayal of women was objectifying.
“It’s the same issues that people have about a lot of things in the final club world, with girls being hypersexualized as props or tools for men to use,” Arral said, adding that she does not plan on attending the party. In his apology email, Cooper indicated that the party will go on as scheduled on Saturday.
Members of Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student group that advocates for changes to Harvard’s handling of sexual assault, also criticized the invitation in a statement, writing that its tone reflects “deep power imbalances.”
Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, the vice president of the Undergraduate Council, said early Friday morning he saw the drawing in the invitation but not the video. Goyal credited Cooper for making an apology and committing to further conversation.
“On behalf of the Council, we respect that Vince has made that statement, and we appreciate the fact that he is willing to have a dialogue with concerned stakeholders about the appropriateness of that email,” Goyal said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jimmy Vesey will enter the ECAC tournament this weekend with another accolade to his name.
Four days after the junior forward clinched the ECAC Hockey scoring crown, the Ivy League named Vesey its 2014-2015 Player of the Year Thursday. The league also recognized linemate and junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo, fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally, junior defenseman Desmond Bergin, co-captain defenseman Max Everson, and fourth-year goaltender Steve Michalek.
Vesey is the ninth Harvard player to win the award since the 1979-1980 season and the first since 2000, when senior goaltender J.R. Prestifilippo received top honors. Vesey’s win, coming on the heels of an All-Ivy Rookie of the Year award in his freshman season, snaps the Crimson’s longest drought since 1980.
The Boston native finished the regular season on Saturday with 22 goals and 22 assists to lead all Division I players in goals per game (0.76). His 1.52 points per game are good for third-best in the country.
A Nashville Predators draft pick, Vesey was one of four unanimous selections to the Ivy League’s first team. Harvard’s last first team selections were defenseman Danny Biega ’13 and forward Alex Killorn ’12 during the 2011-2012 season.
After Vesey, the Ivy League’s next-highest scorer this season was Criscuolo, who received Second Team All-Ivy honors. The New Jersey product tied with Vesey for the most assists among Ivy players and added a career-high 15 goals.
Despite a season shortened by injury, fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally was also recognized on the Second Team. Among Ancient Eight blue liners, McNally led all in points per game and finished just two total points off the pace set by first team selection Rob O’Gara, who played in 29 games to McNally’s 15.
Outside the first and second teams, the Ivy League recognized three players as Honorable Mention All-Ivy. All three wear Crimson: Everson, Bergin, and Michalek. Everson and Bergin have anchored the Crimson’s top two defensive pairs all season while Michalek has been the team’s answer in net, setting a Beanpot single-game saves record in the process.
Yale coach Keith Allain won the inaugural All-Ivy Coach of the Year award as the Bulldogs placed three players on the first team. Yale freshman Ryan Hitchcock was the league’s unanimous choice for Rookie of the Year.

1982-1983 Mark Fusco, D
1983-1984 Grant Blair, G
1984-1985 Scott Fusco, F

When the No. 19/- Harvard men’s ice hockey team played Brown on Feb. 7, Brown had not won a conference game since Dec. 6 and sat in a tie for dead last in the ECAC standings. On the other hand, the Crimson was poised to nab a first-round bye in the ECAC playoffs, sitting comfortably in the top four of the conference standings even after having dropped its last two conference games.
The story is different this time around. And now, the stakes are higher.
Harvard (15-11-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) hosts the Bears (8-18-3, 5-14-3) this weekend at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in a best-of-three series in the opening round of the ECAC playoffs.
Brown would go on to beat the depleted Crimson—who was playing its third game over a five-day stretch at the time—in what would turn out to be a season-changing win. After defeating Harvard, the Bears lost once in the final six remaining games of the season,and also tied the conference leader, No. 11/10 Quinnipiac.
The Bears sudden success comes in large part to the strong play of its first line. Co-captains Mark Naciero and Matt Lorito as well as junior Nick Lappin have found twine nine times in the team’s last six games. Brown has outscored its opponents by an average of one-and-a-half goals over the same stretch.
“All three of those guys on the top line are extremely talented,” junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “I played against two of them before coming to Harvard and they were some of the best guys in the league. You just want to make sure you know when they’re on the ice at all times.”
The Crimson’s end-of-season narrative went differently. Harvard sputtered to the finish line, winning less than half of its games while simultaneously falling out of the national spotlight and sliding out of position for a first-round bye. The Crimson controlled its destiny headed into its final weekend, but saw Dartmouth and Colgate jump them in the standings after an emphatic 5-2 loss to Quinnipiac. Even with a 5-0 win against Princeton on Saturday, the team could not regain the fourth seed. Now, Harvard will have to play two series—not just one—in order to reach the ECAC semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y.
“I don’t think we’re necessarily upset that we have to play this weekend,” Criscuolo said. “I think it’s a good thing. We need to get back on a roll.”
The late season struggles also severely hurt the team’s chance to earn an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament. The Crimson now sit at 22nd in the PairWise Rankings, usually a good estimator for the 16 teams that will be chosen to skate for a national title.
“Ultimately we are going to have to win our way to Lake Placid,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We know that. We need to come out with a good effort…so that we head into the playoffs feeling good about our game.”
In key games against quality opponents down the stretch, the Crimson failed to register a defining win to keep from falling down in the rankings. Harvard took both No. 3/3 Boston University and No. 9/9 Boston College to overtime in the Beanpot, but saw junior Danny O’Regan and sophomore Ryan Fitzgerald notch the game winning goals to hand Harvard the tough losses.
The Crimson still boasts one of the best first lines in the conference. Junior Jimmy Vesey, recently named Ivy League Player of the Year, ranks second in the ECAC in both goals and points with 22 and 44, respectively. Criscuolo ranks fifth in those same categories, with 15 goals and 37 points. Sophomore forward Alex Kerfoot, despite having missed nine conference games this season, has been able to contribute 10 points and eight assists in ECAC play.
“Our goals don’t change,” co-captain Max Everson said. “It’s a couple extra home games. At this point I’d say it is what it is…. There [are] no excuses. We can’t be looking outside the room. We did this to ourselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­It’s not The Game but it’s certainly The Rematch.
When Yale visits Harvard this Friday at Lavietes, it brings more than SportsCenter and sweater vests in tow. The game between the league’s two co-leaders is not only the de facto Ivy League championship game, but a chance for Yale to end Harvard’s hegemony atop the Ancient Eight.
In fact, it’s the most important game in modern Yale basketball history.
Hold with me, dear reader. Yes, Yale has played for national championships before—winning in 1901 and 1903. Yes, it did compete in the first five-on-five game of college basketball history—moving away from the seven- and nine-man lineups of the 1890s.
It has won four Ivy League championships, but just one since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 40 teams and Magic beat Bird in the 1979 final—the widely-accepted beginning of the modern era of college basketball. Its 2002 championship was split three ways, with Yale winning the first playoff game and losing the second. Since the Elis last won a title outright, four alumni have called the White House home.
To properly quantify the team’s struggles, this week I collected the point margins—both in conference and overall—for each Ivy League team going back to the 1979-1980 season. Over that stretch, Yale has been the epitome of good but not great. In fact, from 1980 to 2014, Yale had the best combined point margin (at roughly -0.9 points a game) of any team not named Penn or Princeton. It has won 242 conference games in that span, 10 more than fourth-place Harvard but nearly 100 behind second-place Princeton.
Since current coach James Jones arrived in 1999, the numbers look a bit better. Including this year's number, Yale has 128 conference wins in that span, six more than fourth-place (and next-best) Harvard. Along with Harvard, Penn, and Princeton, it is the only team to post a positive-point margin. By comparison, Dartmouth, the Ivy League’s punching bag, has lost games by an average of eight points over the same time.
Given what Jones inherited—a 4-22 team whose -10.6 points per game conference margin was the 15th worst (fifth percentile) in my sample—his rebuilding job hasn’t been given enough credit. Yale has finished in the league’s top half in every season since 2008, something only Princeton can also say.
His work has been overshadowed, however, by the man coaching Yale’s bitter rival. This is why 2002 isn’t the same as 2015—why any Yale basketball game in the last 40 years doesn’t compare to now. When Yale struggled in the 80s, it was losing to the likes of Princeton and Penn. Now it’s sitting at home watching Harvard every March, and nothing else compares.
While Jones has yet to win a championship, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker inherited one of the league’s worst teams in 2007 and quickly put together a juggernaut. While Harvard is going for a fifth straight conference championship, Yale has had its head slammed up against a glass ceiling for the better part of a decade.
If the Bulldogs are going to break through, Friday night is their best chance. In junior forward Justin Sears, Yale has arguably the best interior player and defender in the Ivy League with shooters  like Armani Cotton, Javier Duren, and Jack Montague to keep defenses honest. Freshman Makai Mason has been a revelation as a sixth man, and the Bulldogs twice fought back from second-half deficits last weekend to get here.
They won in Cambridge last year, briefly taking control of the league before a late season collapse. In an eerily similar situation, Harvard won the league title on Yale’s home floor—celebrating in effusive fashion. Jones, Sears, and co. would like nothing better than to return the favor—and finally break through—Friday.
On to the picks: COLUMBIA AT PENN
The two schools have been in Ivy League athletics news recently for all the wrong reasons. Penn underwent the shame of watching its coach of nearly 20 years supposedly retire from football altogether…and then join the Columbia football program only three weeks later.
Columbia, well, has student newspapers writing columns celebrating losses from December. Slack has to be given, however, now that the Spectator’s previous favorite subject—a turbulent football coach who coached like Madden’s Rookie Mode and took criticism like the Currier Ten-Man—is gone.
Pick: Columbia CORNELL AT PRINCETON
While this is Cornell senior forward Shonn Miller’s last weekend in the Ivy League, it is likely not his final college basketball contests. Miller, who was honored last weekend by Cornell at senior night, has another year of eligibility since he sat out last season with injury; like former Ivy League players Andrew Van Nest ’12 and Dwight Tarwater, Miller is victim to the Ivy League’s policy of forbidding graduate student participation.
Before he shows up as the seventh man on a fringe tournament team from a Big Five conference, Miller has a chance to lay waste to a Princeton front line that Justin Sears devastated last weekend. A winnable sweep of the Penn/Princeton trio would be a memorable and fitting end to Miller’s excellent career.
Of course, seeing as Miller’s own university paper misspelled his name in its lede after arguably the most important victory of his career, he may need to average 60 points a game this weekend or “Shaun Miller” is going to be grabbing the headlines.
Pick: Princeton BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
Captain Morgan and Jack Daniels—two fans who manage to show up at every intense college basketball game—will be in Cambridge Friday night. It’s unclear what’s going to be a bigger deterrent to their arrival in Hanover—the college’s new hard alcohol policy or the team’s dispiriting play, as the team hasn’t won more than 10 Ivy League games since 1980. At 5-7, and with senior Gabas Maldunas out the door, it may be a while still.
Pick: Dartmouth YALE AT HARVARD
It was a classic on the gridiron, and smart money is on another close contest is Cambridge. Harvard is 60-4 since the beginning of the 2010-2011 season at home, and will have a roaring student section behind it. It led Yale almost wire-to-wire in New Haven and if it can take an early lead, its suffocating defense will be enough.
Pick: Harvard COLUMBIA AT PRINCETON
Crazy statistic courtesy of Kevin Whitaker: Princeton led by multiple possessions in the second half of every game in February, but finished the month just 4-4. It welcomes Columbia, who bid its seniors goodbye with a pair of tough home losses to Dartmouth and Harvard last weekend.
When these teams last met, it looked like the winner might challenge Harvard and Yale at the top of the standings. Now it just feels like a sad battle to make the CIT.
Pick: Princeton CORNELL AT PENN
Once upon a time, Cornell-Penn was one of the most dominant rivalries of the Ivy League. The teams have met 122 times on the gridiron for the Trustees’ Cup. Although the title of trophy says quite a bit about Ivy League athletics, it doesn’t speak to the current quality of the rivalry. The two schools ran off six consecutive championships between them in the early part of the century, but look poised to trade spots in the league basement this year.
The teams bring the best out of each other—Penn’s best performance of the year was its win in Ithaca, and last year’s 2-26 Cornell team played Penn within seven points in both meetings.
That’s a bigger feat than it sounds—last year’s Cornell team, judging by average overall point margin, was the worst in the last 35 years of the Ivy League. This year’s Penn team? Well, its -10.75 average conference point margin would just barely crack the top-15 worst teams since 1980.
I do say, Howard, I think I spot a silver lining on that dumpster fire.
Pick: Cornell YALE AT DARTMOUTH
In one of the weekend’s more surprising turns, the Big Green swept the Gentleman’s C’s in dominating fashion. As unlikely as it seemed two weeks ago, Dartmouth has a chance to finish third in the Ivy League standings. However, even if Yale loses Friday, it has something to play for against Dartmouth this year. Sears, Duren, and co. curb-stomped the Big Green to the tune of a 15-point lead in New Haven, and look for a similar result here.
Pick: Yale BROWN AT HARVARD
Last year, Harvard came off a victory over Yale and played lethargic the next night, pulling out an overtime victory in Providence by the skin of its teeth. History ran it back this year, as Harvard once again needed overtime to get a February victory at Brown. In this game, held on Senior Night, Harvard will need to win regardless to take home the title.
The Harvard seniors are looking for their fourth consecutive outright League championship, a virtually unprecedented achievement. Making the NCAA Tournament four years in a row is hard for even the most successful programs; since Harvard made the Dance for the first time three years ago, Kentucky, Indiana, and Georgetown—each college basketball royalty—have each missed it once.
Possibly the most impressive statistic about this group is that with two games to go, they’ve outscored their average Ivy League opponent by 10 points a game. That is nearly twice as good as the next closest squad—Princeton at 5.86 points a game.
When the horn sounds Saturday, these seniors will walk off the court and right into history.
Pick: Harvard
