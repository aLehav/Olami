After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The principal iconographic representation of Harvard University sits elevated in the center of the Old Yard. It is a faded bronze cast with a shiny golden foot, known to visitors as the “John Harvard statue” and to students and alumni as “the statue of the three lies.” The statue’s inscription proclaims “John Harvard – Founder – 1638,” a tripartite tall tale. As every Harvard tour guide will certainly tell you, John Harvard was not the founder of Harvard University, merely the institution’s first major benefactor; Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638; and — dramatic pause — the statue itself does not depict John Harvard.
That Harvard University’s motto is “Veritas” and the statue of its eponymous namesake is false seems ironic. As the Gazette detailed, to the University’s Puritan founders, “Veritas meant more than truth … It meant ‘fulfillment.’” The Puritans longed to attain a biblical truth, brought by a “second coming.” A modern-day understanding of Harvard’s motto reinterprets this Puritan philosophy as the pursuit of knowledge in the hopes of uncovering truth through academia.
This commitment to truth seems more important now than ever, given the increasing politicization of truth and fact. President Donald Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani proclaimed to NBC’s Chuck Todd that “truth isn’t truth” and told CNN’s Chris Cuomo that facts lie “in the eye of the beholder.” The Trump Administration has repeatedly presented falsehoods as fact — such as when Sean Spicer said that the crowd at the president’s inauguration was “the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period” (it wasn’t), and Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in an August 14th press briefing that President Trump had already tripled President Obama’s African American employment numbers (he hasn’t). The Washington Post reported on August 1 that the president himself had made 4,229 false or misleading claims since assuming office, including claiming 88 times that he had passed the largest tax cut in U.S. history (he didn’t).
As a result, a significant contingent of the American public no longer accepts facts and truths for what they are. Conspiracy theorists have experienced their own Internet boom, using platforms like Reddit and Twitter to propel misinformation. Popular Internet conspiracies involve everything from the idea that Hillary Clinton ran a human trafficking ring to “crisis actors” at the Parkland school shooting. While these theories may seem ridiculous from our perspective, they resonate with many Americans. Some — like the existence of a “deep state” — are substantiated by the president himself.
This rhetoric establishes a false dichotomy whereby one set of facts are pitted against baseless, nonsensical “alternative facts.” And in doing so, it has the potential to undermine the findings of academic research, just as it already has undermined the facts found by the news media. Working in journalism this summer, I witnessed the insidious effect these ideas have on the public’s perception of facts. I saw CNN reporters get accosted for doing their jobs by protestors who proclaimed the network produces “fake news.” And soon, I fear, these protestors could turn their attention to academia, which many view as possessing the same liberal bias as the media.
Some already have. The rise of political conspiracies has coincided with the resurgence of the anti-vaccination movement, which claims — contrary to the findings of numerous studies, according to the CDC — that autism spectrum disorder is caused by vaccinating children. The president has stated on Twitter he believes there is a link between autism and vaccines more than 20 times. Conservative school boards have long been ignoring the facts that demonstrate the futility of abstinence-only sex education. In March 2017, Texas joined seven other US states that have proposed legislation that would allow teachers to “present Creationism and scientific theory.” The legislation in Texas later died in committee; however, the Trump Administration’s anti-truth rhetoric could breath new life into it. Climate change, already denied by many on the right, despite being widely accepted as occurring by the scientific community, has been struck from Idaho schools’ science curriculums.
The Administration’s attacks on truth have built upon this history and set the foundation for an educational system where ideas widely accepted by the scientific community are ignored in the classroom in favor of other theories supported by little or no evidence. It is our responsibility, as Harvard students, professors, and administrators, to defend the truth, without equivocating between facts and fiction. I hope that Harvard’s administrators and especially the University’s new leader, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, are willing to speak out in favor of education and truth, as it is more important now than ever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Irony is “incongruity between the actual result of a sequence of events and the normal or expected result.”
Welcome to the Transcript Project.
Announced in Feb. 2018, the Transcript Project allows students to submit pieces of work, such as prose, a photo, or a song, that discusses their academic journey at Harvard. The purpose of the project is to encourage students “to think differently about the intellectual odyssey that being at Harvard can represent,” according to the man who created it — Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey. Instead of focusing on grades, students should “recognize the spirit of adventure which the transcript represents,” said Kelsey.
Harvard has a particular problem with academic rigor and pressure to get immaculate report cards, which can create mental health issues for its students. Given the fact that some classes at Harvard College are graded on a curve (which in and of itself is not a bad thing), an immaculate transcript may inherently necessitate competing against your peers. Thus, Harvard’s academic pressure problem is compounded by and necessarily entwined with a culture of competition that exists at Harvard. It is therefore heartening that the Transcript Project was created in an effort to combat the idea of the college transcript being a source of anxiety.
In order to succeed, a successful initiative would have had to successfully combat the various pressures at Harvard that cause many students to overemphasize grades, academic pressure, and competition.
Except the Transcript Project is — wait for it — a competition.
Yes, the initiative that should combat the culture of academic pressure and competition among peers at Harvard is itself a competition among peers at Harvard.
Not only does this render the project nothing more than a ridiculous lesson in irony, but it also means that the Transcript Project inculcates the very culture it seeks to combat. In the creation of the Transcript Project, the deans of Harvard College have indeed proven that everything at Harvard is a competition between your classmates and necessitates academic pressure.
Seemingly sensing the contradictory nature of his project, Kelsey did not change the nature of it, but rather, at the event congratulating the winners of the contest, qualified the competition by saying there was an emphasis on “creativity” and “participation.”
In this case, the emphasis does not excuse the action. A competition is a competition is a competition. Indeed, the “winners” won not only the title of winner, but also a gift card. Students were pitted against other students, some of whom did better than others and were recognized for it. One could even argue the Transcript Project reflected a more materialistic and self-serving culture than any Harvard class — curved or not — since students were given a monetary reward. Imagine if for every A a student received in a class, they also received cash.
Beat your peers, and you’ll be rewarded financially.
Such is the lesson taught by the Transcript Project.
Of course, there is an important place for contests and competitions that have a select number of winners at Harvard. Academic, athletic, and other types of achievement deserve to be recognized and rewarded with monetary accolades or other forms of recognition, just not in a program whose important goal is to offer an alternative to that formula.
As an alternative, perhaps the College could take a lesson from its signature writing class — Expository Writing 20 — and work with all of the 20 or so participants in the Transcript Project to improve all of their pieces and make them worthy of recognition, instead of selecting six winners. Indeed, the Transcript Project should present “an opportunity for students of all abilities to make progress.”
But until the Transcript Project is amended or scrapped entirely, I urge my fellow students to organize against it and not submit pieces for the competition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In beginning my second year at Harvard, I have spent time thinking about Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s advice — to choose a “transformational” education over a “transactional” one. I remember nodding along at Convocation because making that choice seemed sensible and straightforward.
A spot at Harvard provides a certain freedom from having to be transactional. For better or worse, a Harvard degree helps to alleviate the pressure to concentrate in what one thinks will be most economical. I am also lucky enough for money not to be on my mind every day. This financial privilege has been greater than I initially realized, because the college experience consists of many transactions — not just affording tuition, but also paying to eat in Harvard Square and even to print out course readings.
One can also be transactional by being close-minded. As Khurana defined it in a past Convocation speech, being “transactional” means “focusing on material goals,” like graduate school, and thinking of college as a “stop on the way to the rest of your life.” Being “transactional” doesn’t only apply to those pursuing certain fields — a subject like economics might get a bad name, but in no area is one-track mindedness useful.
In the first few semesters of college, at least, I have found it easy to avoid this transactional mindset. I didn’t come in with one burning passion. I didn’t know enough people to close myself off from the possibility of meeting more. I hadn’t planned my post-college future with any degree of specificity. So I needed to be open-minded.
If “transactional” versus “transformational” were just a binary, I would place myself in the latter category. And yet — a year in, having completed eight of the 32 (in all likelihood) classes I will ever take as a Harvard College student — I don’t think of the difference between “transactional” and “transformational” as a binary. It is more of a scale, like the five-point scales of the Q Guide. And I don’t think that I would give myself a five.
The courses that I’ve taken have undoubtedly transformed me in some way. By simply attending class, one picks up interesting lessons and comes out at semester’s end a different person than one was at the start. Certainly, though, I did more than just attend class. I liked the courses I took. I participated in them. I challenged myself in them. Yet I cannot say I wholly pursued transformation.
I explored, but I never went too far. During shopping weeks, I accompanied friends to classes that I knew I’d never take. But I didn’t change my mind while I was in them. And sure, I had not picked out all my classes before beginning shopping week. But the ones that I walked into and put on my schedule were not random classes. They were in departments that I knew I wanted to study, and they were in subjects that I knew I’d have some knowledge and interest in. For example, when a course on Chinese foreign policy did not fit in my schedule, I simply moved to a course on international relations, which was certainly not true academic exploration.
I did not have the courage to enroll in a course for which I thought I had no talent or aptitude. I did not have the courage to risk failing. So I have judged the things that I thought I would like, and I’ve found that I haven’t liked all of them equally. But I still don’t know what I don’t know.
I haven’t tried very hard to find out, either. Because while I don’t think that I’ve succumbed to fears of financial pressure to choose a certain field of study or career, I have allowed unnecessary fears about time to restrict the extent of my exploration. These are fears of running out of time — the fear of wasting one of the precious four slots I have every semester, of not finishing the General Education requirement if I take too many electives, and maybe worst of all, the fear of eventually finding a concentration or passion that I love — but finding it too late to fully pursue it. These fears may feel more valid and less transactional, but they are nevertheless restrictive mental obstacles that must be overcome.
As I realize now, I have been “transformed,” but only as much as I let myself. Although that is certainly a start, it is not quite enough. Choosing a “transformational” experience requires more than just not being “transactional.” The journey is more important than the end, but I hope this realization is a step in the right direction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his first speech to undergraduates as Harvard's president, Lawrence S. Bacow told the crowd of wide-eyed freshmen he was assigning them homework.
Bacow directed the students — who were crowded into Tercentenary Theater for Harvard’s tenth-annual Freshman Convocation — to take out their phones and write down the address for an Institute of Politics website which they could use to register to vote.
“If you are eligible to vote, we expect you to register, to inform yourself of the candidates and the issues, and to cast a ballot,” Bacow said. “It is your responsibility as a citizen of this country and as a citizen of Harvard.”
“If you don’t think that the world that we live in is perfect, the only way it gets better is if good people like you work to repair it,” he added.
Bacow was chosen for the presidency in February. In his first trip to Washington a few months later, he wasted no time making his goals clear — he told lawmakers he plans to be a devoted advocate for higher education as it faces increasing skepticism and legislative challenges.
This message of civic engagement carried throughout the event, which took place Wednesday afternoon. Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church, began the ceremony with an invocation, praying that the new students pursue “a cause greater than [themselves].” Jenna M.E. Gray ’19 delivered the student address, encouraging freshmen to study abroad in order to gain perspective.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who took to the podium after Bacow, noted that Harvard’s newest undergraduates arrived on campus “at a critical moment in our nation’s history.”
Khurana framed much of his speech around “Autumn...Nothing Personal,” a new art installation in Tercentenary Theater. The installation was inspired by a James Baldwin essay, which, according to Khurana, “describes a divided, violent, and empty America at a different historical moment: the height of the Civil Rights movement.”
“Baldwin’s view of the world in 1964 resonates in so many ways with what we can see is going on in our country and the world today,” Khurana said.
“Given the world that you’ve been handed, you’re going to be faced with some critical choices over the next four years,” he added.
Like Bacow, Khurana entreated members of the Class of 2022 to use their talents and their education to better society.
“The path you choose here has more urgency than whether it’s personally fulfilling to you,” Khurana said. “As you start classes and meet new people, I urge you to watch and listen closely to your faculty, and your peers, and the texts you read.”
“Not only does your education depend on this habit, so does our Republic’s,” he added.

As eager freshmen meander about Harvard Yard and President Lawrence S. Bacow settles into his new office, Harvard — and its lawyers — are getting ready to head to federal court.
The University is battling a four-year-old lawsuit brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions that alleges the College discriminates against Asian-Americans in its admissions process. Harvard has repeatedly denied SFFA’s charges, arguing that it must consider race in order to forge a diverse student body and fulfill its educational mission.
The lawsuit heated up along with the summer’s searing temperatures. In June and July, Harvard was forced to publish hundreds of pages of internal documents related to its admissions process as part of the suit. Many revealed the inner workings of the College’s notoriously secretive admissions office, prompting national headlines. The drama wasn't over, though; just last week, the Justice Department sent shockwaves across the country when it intervened forcefully on the side of the plaintiff and publicly accused Harvard of racial discrimination.
The case is set to go to trial on Oct. 15 in a Boston courthouse. A lot happened over the summer — so read up on the five major developments you need to know before the school year starts.
The federal government appears to have picked a side — and it’s not Harvard’s.
The United States Department of Justice filed a scorching ”statement of interest” in the case last week that accused Harvard of committing “unlawful racial discrimination” and asserted its candidate evaluation process is “infected with racial bias.” The department had signaled before that it was sympathetic to SFFA; but Thursday’s memo marked its strongest intervention to date.
Department lawyers wrote in the court filing that evidence that bubbled up over the summer supports SFFA’s accusations. Attorneys justified the Justice Department’s interference by pointing to the fact that Harvard receives significant federal funding. Taxpayer dollars must not “serve to finance the evil of private prejudice,” the lawyers wrote.
Legal experts say the timing of the department’s filing is unusual and means the federal government may sue the University for its admissions policies. The department is already conducting a separate probe — overseen by top department officials — into whether Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Department lawyers have reviewed confidential student records as part of that inquiry.
But the Trump administration is looking beyond Cambridge in its efforts to roll back affirmative action. The federal government in early July authored a “Dear Colleague” letter notifying university administrators that it had withdrawn Obama-era recommendations promoting the consideration of race in college admissions.
SFFA has accused Harvard of giving Asian-American applicants poor “personal ratings” in an effort to derail their candidacies despite generally stellar academic records. The group says Harvard’s admissions process puts Asian-American students at a significant disadvantage.
A 2013 internal Harvard review that came to light over the summer shows that the University at one point concluded the same thing.
A June 15 court filing revealed that Harvard’s internal research office produced a top-secret series of reports several years ago that found the College’s admissions policies produce “negative effects” for Asian Americans. One report noted Asian Americans received consistently lower scores for their personal traits — things like “humor” and “grit” — than did applicants of other races. The University has disputed the claim that its evaluation of applicants is discriminatory.
Harvard’s research office presented its findings to senior officials including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. But the report was never made public and top administrators did not take any significant action to address the issue.
In court filings over the summer, Harvard officials and lawyers argued the 2013 research was incomplete and not meant to uncover possible discrimination.
The internal Harvard reports are one of many secrets the lawsuit has unearthed.
Other details that sprang from documents released over the summer include tidbits about the so-called “Z-list,” a small pool of students whose offers of admission Harvard defers for a year. Court filings showed that students who receive spots on the Z-list are overwhelmingly white and that almost half them are legacies, meaning at least one of their parents attended Harvard.
That wasn’t the only revelation about Harvard and its legacy students. Filings showed that the acceptance rate for legacy students is about five times that of non-legacy students. More than a third of legacy students who applied won admission to the Classes of 2014 through 2019.
Documents also revealed that recruited athletes see relatively high rates of admission compared to non-athletes. Of athletes with high academic scores, 83 percent earned admission, while only 16 percent of non-athletes with top-tier academic ratings did so.
Other filings uncovered the fact that Harvard specifically trains its admissions officers on how to weigh race in the admissions process.
The disclosure of these details comes amid a months-long dispute over which admissions documents and applicant data should remain confidential. Harvard has fought to file information under seal, meaning only parties to the suit could see it. But a federal judge ultimately ruled that many documents — ranging from statistical analyses to admissions officers’ emails — must become public.
If the suit goes to trial in October — which experts have said is all but certain — thousands of additional pages of student records could enter the public domain.
Harvard and SFFA have one thing in common: both want to prevent a trial.
Lawyers for the two parties have asserted that the facts of the case are so clearly in support of their respective arguments that Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who is presiding over the case, should rule on some or all of the charges without allowing the lawsuit to proceed to a full trial.
On June 15, each party filed briefs — comprising hundreds of pages of expert statistical analyses and depositions from top Harvard administrators like former University President Drew G. Faust and Khurana — that argued for dismissal. Over the next several months, Harvard and SFFA rebutted each other’s arguments and gave their versions of the “undisputed facts” of the case.
As recently as last week, the parties continued to skirmish over the issue. Harvard, in a last-ditch effort to avoid a trial, tried to argue that the SFFA lacks legitimate standing to sue.
Despite all of this, legal experts — as well as the judge herself — say a summary judgement is highly unlikely. The trial, slated to be held in the U.S. District Court in Boston, is expected to take place — and to last for several weeks.
Some say the case is destined for the Supreme Court. If it reaches the Court — and if nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh wins a seat on that Court — the decision could end affirmative action in the United States.
As they spar in federal court, Harvard and SFFA have at times benefited from the the help of outside allies.
Numerous third parties have filed amicus or “friend-of-the-court” briefs in favor of one side or the other. The Department of Justice is the most notable name to throw its weight behind SFFA so far, though lesser-known individuals and organizations have also come to their aid.
The Asian American Coalition for Education filed an amicus brief supporting SFFA on behalf of 156 Asian American organizations in July. Five economists, as well as conservative think tanks like the National Association of Scholars, filed in support of the plaintiff around the same time.
Higher education appears to have listened to Harvard’s call. Sixteen top American universities — including every member of the Ivy League — filed a joint brief defending the University’s race-conscious admissions in July. Last week, Harvard students spoke out in favor of affirmative action when 25 campus student groups — including 10 Asian or Asian-American interest groups — filed a joint brief with the help of lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
The American Civil Liberties Union also filed a brief arguing for Harvard over the summer, as did 15 economists and 531 social scientists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As first-year students struggled under the weight of Bed, Bath, and Beyond boxes during move-in last week, newly-minted University President Lawrence S. Bacow didn’t stand idly by.
Leigh Sharpless ’22 said she was pleasantly surprised when Harvard’s newest leader “swooped in” to help her father carry her boxes into Weld Hall. Sharpless’s father was in the process of lugging two boxes to Weld and was “obviously struggling,” Sharpless said.
“Like the hero he’s made out to be, [Bacow] offered a hand to my dad to help carry a box, and it was really great and it was just at the right time, too,” she said.
Two months into his presidency — and days into his first semester — Bacow is taking an active, and very visible, role in undergraduate life. University presidents often spend time huddling with top administrators, talking strategy with higher education leaders, lobbying politicians, and exchanging pleasantries with foreign dignitaries. Bacow has already made a point of including box-lugging and trading stories with undergraduates in the repertoire.
Bacow wrote in an emailed statement that he and his wife, Adele, “enjoyed” the experience of their first move-in day at the College, which occurred just a month after Bacow moved into his new office with the start of his tenure.
“It was inspiring meeting students and their families from all over the U.S. and the world. We loved seeing the excitement on students' faces and the pride in their parents’ hearts,” Bacow said.
Harvard documented Bacow’s presence in the Yard on its Instagram (@harvard), where Bacow and his wife were pictured wearing official “Move-In Day Staff” shirts with first-year students. Bacow and Adele took a selfie with two international students — Robert Kossmann ’22 and Luke Walker ’22 — that appeared on the account, along with several photos of move-in day events.
Kossmann said that he and Walker approached Bacow to ask if he would take a picture with them and that Bacow was “very enthusiastic.” Kossmann added he thought Bacow’s enthusiasm signaled that the University is an “inclusive institution.”
Kossmann added that he expected that Bacow “would not have much time,” but that the two had a “pretty cool” conversation about Bacow’s parents’ immigrant background, which resonated with Kossmann, an international student from Germany.
“It’s my first time coming to the U.S.,” Kossmann said. “Hearing the president of the University tell me how his parents had assimilated from an immigrant background was definitely interesting to hear.”
Besides heavy-lifting in the Yard, Bacow also visited the inaugural group of First-Year Retreat and Experience participants.
FYRE leader Daniel Rodriguez ’20 said Bacow helped to quell common fears among first-generation students and encouraged students to find a community at Harvard that will support them.
“Having somebody at the forefront of Harvard and leading this college come in and talk to the students, show that they actually belong here and actually have a place to be here was really helpful,” Rodriguez said.
Bacow, who previously helmed Tufts for 10 years, was known at the school for his involvement in undergraduate life — a reputation he appears to be recreating at Harvard.
When Bacow was selected as the University President last February, Kirkland House administrator Kate D. Cavell — who had been an undergraduate at Tufts — dubbed him a “champion of undergraduates.” Bacow, an avid runner, was known for going on runs with Tufts students, a tradition he continued during Opening Days — he hosted a mid-run stop at Elmwood, the presidential residence, for a group of freshmen runners.
At Tufts, he invited students to his house and made a point of personally responding to every email he received, according to Tufts’s website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in roughly two decades, voters in Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville will vote in a highly contested Democratic primary — one that has received growing national attention.
Ayanna S. Pressley, a progressive and a familiar face in Boston politics for the last decade, will take on congressman Michael E. Capuano, a 20-year incumbent who possesses liberal bona fides of his own on Tuesday.
Capuano, 66, served as mayor of Somerville before winning a crowded Democratic primary in 1998 to represent Massachusetts’s 8th U.S. congressional district (since redistricted to become the 7th district), which cuts a wide swath across Boston and its suburbs. Since that time, he has never faced a serious challenge, comfortably winning the majority of the vote in all nine of his re-election bids.
Pressley, 44, the first woman of color elected to the Boston City Council, has won endorsements from local newspapers in addition to multiple state officials, including Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey ’92.
The winner of the primary will almost certainly win the general election in November, as no Republicans filed to run for the seat.
Pressley’s quest to take on the 10-term congressman has garnered national media attention for its parallels to a recent New York congressional primary, in which progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez upset long-term representative and Democratic Party mainstay Joseph Crowley.
When Pressley visited Harvard Medical School — which lies in the 7th district — last month, her introducer referenced Ocasio-Cortez almost immediately. The two women exchanged endorsements and have appeared together at campaign events.
After Ocasio-Cortez’s unexpected victory, many political pundits have looked toward the Massachusetts race as a potential sequel — and another sign of the growing rift in the Democratic party between establishment figures and young activists eager to upend the status quo. National political reporters have descended on Boston and Somerville in recent days to cover what many are billing as a bellwether.
In interviews with district residents on the streets of Allston and on Harvard Business School’s campus Monday evening, many were oblivious to the upcoming election. Two said they had not yet made up their minds about which candidate to support, and multiple others said they didn’t plan to vote at all.
The Harvard College Democrats are not planning any official get-out-the-vote efforts in the district, according to Devontae A. Freeland ’19, the group’s president.
John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Institute of Politics, wrote in an email that the race has centered more around identity than ideology.
“Congressman Capuano has run a hard-fought campaign strongly defending his progressive credentials in debates, through surrogates and paid media,” he wrote. “If Pressley wins, it will be less about ideology, and more about voters choosing a representative who better reflects the demographics (younger, majority-minority) of the district.”
Though the parallels between the congressional races in New York and Massachusetts are apparent — both Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez are young women of color challenging entrenched white male incumbents — the dynamics in the races are in many ways markedly different.
For one, the ideological gap between Capuano and Pressley is much narrower than that between Ocasio-Cortez and Crowley in New York — a fact Pressley has acknowledged. Both Capuano and Pressley support single-payer health care, propose cuts to military spending, and strongly oppose President Donald Trump.
In addition, while Ocasio-Cortez ran as a consummate outsider, Pressley has held elected office for close to a decade.
Freeland, president of the Harvard College Democrats, argued that the comparisons between the two races are misguided.
“I think that these folks are missing a particular context of this district in Massachusetts and trying to conflate it with other districts in the country,” he said. “Boston is a community that is distinct from New York and has its own motivations.”
Both the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald recently endorsed Pressley, citing her potential to shape the conversation in Washington in a way that an entrenched incumbent such as Capuano could not.
“Ayanna Pressley is such a powerful persona that her election would change the dynamic of the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation,” the Herald wrote. “She’d be an instant leader.”
Rather than attacking Capuano’s voting record on the campaign trail, Pressley has focused on her background growing up in a single-family home and as a survivor of sexual assault, as well as her advocacy on behalf of low-income families since she joined the Council in 2010.
Her signature campaign phrase is “The people closest to the pain should be closest to power.”
In a recent online campaign advertisement, Pressley highlighted the deep economic disparities between the first and last stops of the Number 1 bus, which runs from Harvard Square to Roxbury, a Boston neighborhood where the child poverty rate hovers near 50 percent.
“You can learn everything you need to know about the 7th congressional district by riding the Number 1 bus from Cambridge to Roxbury,” she said. “In a matter of blocks, you will see a stark visual contrast of life experiences, household median income, and quite literally, life expectancy.”
Government Professor Daniel Carpenter called Pressley “impressive” in an email, saying she has a “real shot” at edging out Capuano largely because she is well-known in the district and possesses significant “political knowledge” and “organization.”
Though the race has generated quite a bit of buzz, there has been scant polling of the race.  Recent polls conducted in July have shown Capuano with a lead in the high single-digits or low double-digits.
“Races like this are notoriously difficult to predict because they are primaries and have low turnout,” Carpenter wrote. “The fact that the primary occurs during ‘back to school’ week, and right after Labor Day, may further depress turnout, though I could also see a scenario where young voters turn out at higher rates than usual, and probably for Pressley.”
If Pressley wins, she would be the first African American to represent Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, Keturah J. Gadson ’21 traded Cambridge brick for the open skies of Sunflower, Mississippi — a town with a population of just over 1,000 which she described as "hallowed ground... frozen in time” — to help teach local students as part of the Sunflower County Freedom Project.
Gadson is one of 121 Harvard students who participated in paid public service internships this summer funded by the Mindich Summer Fellowship Program, Liman Public Interest Law Fellowship program, the Harvard Clubs Summer Community Service Fellowship program, and the federal work-study program. Harvard’s Center for Public Interest Careers helps coordinate these summer fellowships.
On Friday, roughly 50 students and Harvard affiliates gathered on campus for CPIC’s first End-of-Summer Symposium to share their experiences and offer feedback for future programming.
Student leaders from nine different “sites” of service spoke at the symposium about their time away from Harvard, which involved teaching, campaigning for the opening of a mental health clinic, and providing financial counseling and emergency grants to parents in need.
Though speakers mentioned high points, multiple students said they felt ineffectual at times.
Savannah J. Miles ’19, who worked in Los Angeles with the community service organization LIFT, said she felt “a little down” about not always being able to help members achieve their goals.
She said that, while progress was not something she could easily measure, the “collection of moments and stories and relationships” she gained this summer had their own value.
For Gadson, her internship presented an opportunity to give back to a community that reminded her of home.
“It really felt like things had come full circle,” said Gadson, whose family moved from Mississippi during the Great Migration. “To be able to go back and help the families that either could not leave or have had to go back to Mississippi was very inspiring.”
Trevor W. Ladner ’20, who worked in Meridian, Miss. with the Meridian Freedom Project, said he hopes more students will invest their time in rural communities, where change is ongoing.
“Working with my students this summer, especially the girls that I worked with in my journalism class, they were very adamant that people in power — particularly adults — don’t trust young people to have good ideas or to make positive change,” Ladner said.
“I think it’s important for intellectuals and Harvard students to support that work, and to go back to these places,” he added.
While CPIC programs are well-established in eight urban centers across the country, organizations in the Mississippi Delta form a new opportunity for undergraduates.
“There’s just not a lot of focus on rural communities or course options on rural communities at Harvard,” Gadson said. “As part of that, we want to recruit with intentionality.”
When she interviewed with the Sunflower County Freedom Project, she said, interviewers emphasized “what it means for the students to see a black girl that goes to Harvard.”
“That was something that came alive every single day in the classroom,” Gadson said.
Gadson, who said she wants to work in education policy in the future, said her experiences this summer made a career in public service seem more viable.
“Getting to see adults who have actually made careers of public service, and the community that you can have in a pursuit like that, was very inspiring and encouraging,” she said.
CPIC Director Travis A. Lovett and CPIC Community Relations Fellow Alysha L. Johnson Williams ’14 said they enjoyed hearing about students’ summer service.
“Travis and I know these internships inside and out. We know the partners, we know the job descriptions. But the students add such a different dimension,” Johnson said. “To see the students pick up these internships and transform them is something incredible.”

Tuesday marks a turning point in the 2018 Massachusetts election cycle. Residents will head to the polls tomorrow starting around 7 a.m. to cast their votes in the state primaries and decide races that vary from non-competitive to hotly contested. Here are some of the candidates, as well as information about where you can vote.
Cambridge residents will cast their votes Tuesday, Sept. 4 from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m. in one of 29 local polling places, including Quincy House, one of the 12 undergraduate Houses on Harvard’s campus. See the map below for some of the many nearby places to vote.

Incumbent Elizabeth Warren is unopposed within the Democratic party in her bid for a second term as a U.S. senator. Several polls find Warren with a comfortable lead against her three Republican challengers — and with $31.5 million raised, she is the indisputable winner of the race for funding.
From the Republican party, three candidates are vying for the chance to oppose Warren. Of the three, Geoff Diehl won the endorsement from the Massachusetts Republican Party. Diehl has made his name as a strong Trump supporter; in 2016, he was co-chair of the Mass. effort to elect Trump. His challengers are John Kingston III — who has rustled up $5.9 million, making him a more successful fundraiser than any other Republican candidate — and Beth Joyce Lindstrom, the first female executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party.
Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, the self-proclaimed inventor of email, is running as an independent candidate. His campaign has proven controversial for his tactics against Warren, whom he calls a “fake Indian.” Polls suggest Ayyadurai is unlikely to win.
“America’s most popular Governor” Charlie Baker ’79 is far and away the favorite to win re-election to the governorship. A moderate Republican, Baker has garnered a 74 percent approval rating in a traditionally blue state, the highest of any governor in the nation, according to polling done by WBUR radio station and a Massachusetts-based think tank. The poll found that Baker is more popular with Mass. women than Warren.
Baker’s only Republican challenger is Scott Lively, known primarily for his anti-BGLTQ activism. His book “The Pink Swastika” includes the line, “While we cannot say that homosexuals caused the Holocaust, we must not ignore their central role in Nazism.”
On the Democratic side, Baker faces Jay M. Gonzalez — the former CEO of healthcare company CeltiCare — and Bob Massie, a longtime advocate for improved healthcare. Gonzalez, the former budget chief for former Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, earned the endorsement of the Massachusetts Democratic Party at its summer convention.
Incumbent Republican Karyn Polito was elected alongside Baker in 2014, and she has worked to tie herself to his governorship. She is unopposed within her own party, but will face two Democratic challengers in the Sept. 4 primary. Quentin Palfrey ’96, former senior advisor to President Barack Obama on jobs and the economy, is something approaching a native son of Harvard — he boasts degrees from the College and the Law School and is the child of Adams House Faculty Deans Sean and Judith Palfrey. He will face Jimmy Tingle, a comedian and the founder of the organization Humor for Humanity.
Popular incumbent Democratic Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 runs unopposed as she seeks her party’s nomination for a second term in office. On the right, attorneys James R. McMahon III and Daniel L. Shores are vying for a chance to oppose Healey in November’s general election.
William F. Galvin, Massachusetts’s eight term incumbent Secretary of State, is facing uncharacteristically steep competition from current Boston City Councilor and community activist Josh Zakim, who won the endorsement of the Massachusetts Democratic Party in a surprising upset at its July convention. The winner of Tuesday’s contest will face Anthony M. Amore, the lone Republican contender, in the general election. Amore is currently head of security and chief investigator at the Isabella Stewart Gardner museum.
In addition to the closely watched races at the statewide level, incumbent Democratic representatives Katherine M. Clark and Michael E. Capuano, both of whom represent portions of Cambridge, are seeking their party’s nomination for their fourth and eleventh terms in the U.S. House, respectively.
While Clark is running unopposed in Tuesday’s primary for the fifth district, Capuano faces strong competition for the seventh's Democratic ticket from Ayanna S. Pressley.  Pressley, a current Boston City Councilor and the Council’s first woman of color, is relying on the momentum of her highly publicized opposition campaign to end Capuano’s 20 year tenure. The victor of this contest in the seventh district will go into the general election unopposed.
In the fifth district’s November general, Clark will run against either self-proclaimed “working class candidate” John Hugo or dermatologist Louis Kuchnir from the Republican party.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts voters head to the polls today in a primary election that will winnow the field in a number of high-profile state and federal races. Some things to watch: Democrats will choose their candidate to take on Republican Governor Charlie Baker ’79 in November, a nationally scrutinized race between U.S. Representative Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) and challenger Ayanna Pressley will come to a head, and Quentin Palfrey ’96 — the son of Adams House faculty deans Sean and Judith Palfrey — will vie for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor.
The Crimson sent reporters to Cambridge and Allston polling locations to talk to voters about a number of key races for state offices, U.S. Senate, and U.S. Congress. Read our live updates below.

Sept. 4, 6 p.m., Quincy House 
A tepid but consistent stream of Cantabrigians continued to make their way to Quincy House, one of 12 undergraduate houses located on Harvard’s campus and one of 29 polling places.
Madeline K. Hilla, a resident of the Harvard Square area and self-described “lifelong progressive,” said she was excited to support the bid of Senator Elizabeth A. Warren, who is running unopposed in today’s primary for a second term in office.
“I’ve admired her for years and really just think she’s a great leader and great woman,” Hilla said. “I’m crossing my fingers that she’ll end up running for president.”
While Hilla voiced support for gubernatorial candidate Bob Massie and incumbent Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92, both Democrats, she said she wasn’t “too familiar with some of the more local candidates.”
Elizabeth H. Clement, who joined Hilla at the polls today, echoed her friend’s sentiments and said she will be “anxiously waiting”  to see the results as they come out later tonight.

September 4, 5 p.m., Gund Hall, Harvard Graduate School of Design 
As light filtered in through staircase-like windows, two children enthusiastically played among the concrete walls of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, both sporting “I Voted” stickers. They accompanied their father, Sajjad H. Rizvi, as he voted in the Massachusetts primary.
Rizvi, a 2015 graduate of the Harvard Extension School, said that he wants to instill in his children the significance of civic participation
“It’s important that if they see parents going out to vote, when they grow up — when it’s going to be difficult to go or if they don’t feel like it — they understand the importance that you have to, to make your voice matter. That’s the biggest reason why I came to vote,” Rizvi said.
Tessa T. Byer, another voter in the primary, said the "I Voted" the stickers from the primary can be a reminder that the general election is coming up.
“I had a lot of co-workers who registered to vote for November today because they were getting all the buzz about voting,” Byer said.
J. Andres Ballesteros ’13 said that the primary is especially important in Massachusetts, a state that tends to overwhelmingly vote for one party over the other.
“Because Massachusetts and Cambridge in particular are so solidly Democratic, this is the main election in a lot of ways — the primary more so than the general,” Ballesteros said. “I think it’s going to be one sign among many about the direction the Democratic Party is going to take.”

Sept. 4, 5 p.m., Allston:
Traffic at the Honan-Allston Library polling station is picking up in the after-work hours.
In the race for Massachusetts’s 7th congressional district, voters at this polling place appear to be fairly split
between Boston City Councilwoman Ayanna Pressley and incumbent representative Michael Capuano, with
Pressley voters citing a need for change and Capuano supporters citing his progressive record and ability to oppose Republicans’ agenda.
Shylana Roman praised Capuano’s “progressive record,” but nonetheless cast her vote for Pressley.
“I think it’s time for a change, someone who represents my voice a little more and looks like the people that they represent.”
Another Pressley voter said it was time for “new blood.”
Michael Fleischman said he voted for Capuano, adding that the 10-term congressman has proved he can “stand up to the Republicans.”  A newcomer like Pressley would have trouble doing so, he said.
Stephanie Powers said that although the candidates didn’t differ in “most policies,” the fact that Pressley is a woman and a member of a racial minority group was decisive in gaining her vote.
“We need more people like that in office,” she said. were a lot of people running for reelection, and they were being contested by people, and more often than not, I voted for the challenger.”

Sept. 4, 10 a.m., Quincy House:
The polling station for Ward 8, Precinct 3 opened at 7 a.m. inside Quincy House, one of the College’s twelve undergraduate houses. After two and a half hours, only 18 people had cast ballots.
Emir E. Aviles, a Cambridge resident, said there were not many candidates to choose from on his ballot.
“I’m just looking for candidates who will make the city and state better,” Aviles said. “There wasn’t that many options at least on my ballot, either incumbent or write-in.”
For Gregory K. Davis, a Psychology department concentration advisor, although there were not many contested races on his Democratic ballot, he said the ones that were contested offered the opportunity for a new representative.
“Many of the positions are running unopposed. The ones that were, though, had some interesting people,” Davis said. “For the most part, I’m interested in fresh blood, new blood. There were a lot of people running for reelection, and they were being contested by people, and more often than not, I voted for the challenger.”
Chris Mackin, another Cambridge resident, noted that even though “there isn’t much going on” in terms of his ballot, the ability to vote is an important civic and personal responsibility — even a “moral responsibility.”
“It’s a privilege,” Mackin said. “I didn’t want to look back on it and feel like you didn’t do it.”
— Leon K. Yang, Crimson Staff Writer
Sept. 4, 9:15 a.m., Friends Meeting at Cambridge Meeting House:
At the Quaker meetinghouse near Longfellow Park, a slow but steady stream of voters are making their way towards the ballot box. The meetinghouse itself is decked out in decor championing progressive causes, with pride flags and posters in support of refugees.
Several voters approached by The Crimson voiced excitement for the Democratic Party. Cambridge resident Eleanor M. Mullen said that while she did not recognize all the names on the ballot, she was happy to vote with her party. “My family throughout Connecticut and Massachusetts reminded me five times yesterday and today to vote,” she added.
Other voters said they were more interested in specific candidates. Evelyn S. Wyman voiced her support for Lieutenant Governor candidate Jimmy Tingle because she said she knows him through church. Roger S. Webb ’58, a longtime Cambridge resident and active voter, said “I came this morning specifically to vote for [candidate Ayanna S.] Pressley, and I’m very disappointed that she’s not on our ballot. I wanted the honor and the thrill of voting for Pressley — I would very much like to see her win.” Pressley is vying to unseat U.S. Representative Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) in Massachusetts’s 7th congressional district.
Webb also said he adamantly supports the growth of the middle class, and that he cast a vote for Elizabeth Warren for this reason.

Sept. 4, 7 a.m.: Polls open across the state. Two buildings on Harvard's campus — Quincy House and Gund Hall — are polling sites.
