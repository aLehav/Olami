After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am not the first person to take issue with Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. defending Harvey Weinstein. As others have pointed out, one can believe that Weinstein deserves a competent legal team while also believing that Sullivan should not have taken the case. He may be a lawyer, but he also chose to serve as a faculty dean, and that role comes with obligations to the Winthrop and Harvard communities that should not be taken lightly. There are many, many lawyers that Weinstein can hire. There are only two faculty deans of Winthrop House.
As someone who loves Winthrop and served as its House Committee chair, Sullivan’s choice feels like a personal betrayal. I spent three incredible years in Winthrop and invested myself deeply into the house community. I credit Winthrop House for many of my happiest memories and best friends, and I’ve always been incredibly proud of my Winthropian identity. As students, we were told to view Winthrop as a home and to consider the staff and students as our family, and I did.
My love of Winthrop is what makes reading the headline “Harvard Law Prof. and Winthrop Dean Ronald Sullivan Joins Harvey Weinstein’s Legal Team” so painful. I don’t just disagree with Sullivan’s actions; I’m ashamed of them. Where are those values of family and community that he always spoke about? How am I supposed to be proud of my affiliation to a house which now links me to a man whose crimes are so egregious that they launched a whole movement?
I know I am not the only Winthropian to feel this way. In his email to Winthrop residents, Sullivan invites students with questions or concerns to his office hours. But let’s be real: Does anyone think Sullivan is going to drop this high-profile case because of unhappy students and a few op-eds? I don’t think so. This raises a question I have asked myself multiple times throughout my experience with House life: Who actually has the power to hold faculty deans accountable for their actions?
The housing system is a defining characteristic of Harvard. And while the idea of smaller residential communities within a large college makes a lot of sense, the way the system is actually run is fairly absurd. For all intents and purposes, each House is its own fiefdom. Faculty deans reign over their domains with a large amount of independence, and it’s up to them whether their House feels like a democratic institution or an authoritarian state. Deans can set their own House rules, leading to discrepancies between Houses in things like party registration systems, available social spaces, and quality of House programming. Deans can also oversee hiring their own staff, which has resulted at least once in concerns about biased hiring.
One thing all Houses have in common, though, is that the faculty deans are in charge. And if students or staff have complaints about the way faculty deans are running a House, often the only people they have to turn to are the deans themselves.
But students rarely do so, because they don’t want to risk damaging their relationships with their deans, who are the most powerful figures in their day-to-day lives. If I were still in Winthrop and needed Sullivan’s approval for HoCo events, or wanted a recommendation letter for a fellowship, or was applying to Harvard Law School, I would not be writing this op-ed.
House administrators and staff have even more to lose, as the faculty deans are their bosses. Residential tutors are in an especially difficult situation; though they are the ones who interact most with students on a day to day basis, they remain in the Houses (their permanent residencies) only at the discretion of faculty deans.
I am not suggesting that any faculty deans are intentionally vindictive against those who express criticism of them. However, the combination of the residential nature of Houses and the rigid, vertical power structure can create an environment where House members do not feel comfortable critiquing the people who have power over their daily lives and future opportunities. Ideally, faculty deans would be receptive to direct feedback, but a system cannot rely upon the goodwill of the individuals in power. There needs to be another channel of accountability.
Currently, it is not even clear who oversees the faculty deans. The Dean of Harvard College is the only position that obviously outranks the faculty deans, but many students might not feel comfortable approaching such a high status and busy individual with their concerns. Furthermore, as a faculty dean himself, there is a clear conflict of interest. Students and staff with criticisms of their faculty deans should not have to turn to another faculty dean when seeking assistance. There is also the additional issue of Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s own students not having a higher power to turn to. As someone who has pushed hard for House life to truly be at the center of College life, Khurana has an obligation to review the current structure with scrutiny and make improvements.
Harvard College needs to make faculty deans more directly accountable to their students and staff. This is not an honorary position that should play second fiddle to another profession; it’s a very serious commitment to lead and represent a community of people. This is not to say that deans can’t occupy various roles; indeed, their many experiences are part of what they bring to their house community. However, the office of the faculty dean needs to better defined and more transparent. The current lack of oversight, consistency, and established avenues for complaints make it very difficult to hold faculty deans accountable. For the sake of the staff and students they serve, this must change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Federal Reserve’s two most recent unemployment reports remind us that the nation’s top economists remain optimistic about the job market. It’s a familiar tune by now: Business is scrambling for new employees and work is plentiful. As Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome H. Powell put it plainly in his January report, “The jobs picture continues to be strong.”
Yet something about economists’ unwavering optimism seems to offend the progressive sensibilities. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls, including California Senator Kamala D. Harris, Massachusetts Senator and Law School Professor emeritus Elizabeth A. Warren, and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, have already made fixing the economy a keystone issue — adding to a raucous chorus of new progressive voices in Congress that are raising concerns about subsistence wages and what they consider the growing ranks of working poor. There’s also something unsettling, as the conservative British author Tim Montgomerie once put it, about the amorality of the capitalist marketplace in general. Something about divorcing economics from civic or moral judgment naturally unsettles us.
As government economists continue to laud the current job climate, we might stop to consider the question of work from a civic perspective. Are we missing something important about the quality and dignity of labor in the American economy, as so many Democrats — particularly from the party’s progressive wing — would have us believe?
As with all civic questions, the Founders are a safe place to start. What do they tell us about the kind of work Americans should aspire to?
Thomas Jefferson, perhaps the most interested of the Founders in the course that labor might take in an industrial age, was deeply skeptical of factory work. In Query XIX of his “Notes on the State of Virginia,” Jefferson laid out his skepticism explicitly, noting, “[L]et us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a work-bench, or twirling a distaff.”
In his essay on a “Project for Moral Perfection” from his autobiography, Benjamin Franklin supplied another kind of insight on the question of dignified work, listing “Industry” as a cardinal virtue, whose chief precept he described succinctly as “Lose no Time.” In that same essay, Franklin characterized industry as “producing Affluence and Independance [sic].”
Abraham Lincoln, perhaps America’s greatest public philosopher (though not technically a Founder), would also speak on several occasions about work. In a speech from 1860, Lincoln observed, “When one starts poor, as do most in the race of life, free society is such that he knows he can better his condition.” It is the promise of improvement that justifies the unequal division of endowments in a free society. As long as a person can expect to see returns on their hard work, what does it matter if they start out as a hired hand?
For a long time, these civic and moral questions of economic thinking received similar neglect from Republicans and Democrats. In his book “The Age of Reform,” the great historian of American populism Richard Hofstadter describes a sense of disinterest in the grander moral and ethical questions of the economy following Roosevelt’s New Deal. The new faith was in “enlightened administration” and no longer in the moral project that that solution was meant to underwrite. Now that disinterest, I think, has evolved into full amoral rot.
To recover the project, I think it would do us good to introduce some healthy normativity into the “dismal science.”
We can consider the jobs question. The Federal Open Market Committee’s December 2018 report was in many ways promising. Unemployment bottomed out at 3.7 percent, near all-time “tights” (job openings per worker). Year-over-year wage growth in non-farm industries also tracked slightly above two percent, narrowly outpacing inflation. And staff economists predicted “larger-than-usual upward pressure” on labor force participation rate (a measure of working or work-seeking adults as a fraction of the total working-age population).
These data paint a singularly optimistic picture of the American labor market (lethargic wages notwithstanding). The takeaways from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ most recent data, however, were more ambiguous. On the one hand, as labor market economist Julia Pollak ’09 pointed out, the tight labor market meant more choices for workers, whether as better pay packages, expanded non-wage benefits, or more professional advancement opportunities.
But amid the “arms race to bring in people,” certain sectors saw their greatest increases in the low-skilled bucket. In health care, the fastest growing sub-sector was ambulatory services, which saw 22,000 new jobs. In “transportation and warehousing,” the largest job gains materialized among “couriers and messengers” and “warehousing and storage.” Additionally, two of the fastest growing sectors year-over-year for 2018 were manufacturing and food services, industries known for slim worker protections and ultra-high turnover.
At the state level, job-growth data gives similar reason for pause. Florida reports that it needs more construction workers; Texas more truckers; and Carmel, Indiana more fast food workers. These are fine jobs, but perhaps not ones that offer citizens a better alternative to Jefferson’s dreaded “work-bench” or Franklin’s dependency job.
What I suggest is that as new figures on the size of the economy continue to emerge, we also apply to them our age-old civic questions. Do these jobs foster livelihoods? Do they fortify character? And most importantly, do they pave the way to individual improvement?
When we can answer all these questions in the affirmative, then we will have achieved strong economies both fiscal and moral. That kind of achievement would truly signal American greatness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, Harvard spent $600,000, more than any other Ivy League school, lobbying the federal government on issues relating to the University and its students. The University has indicated that its lobbying efforts have been primarily focused on thwarting the endowment tax, protecting research funding and student aid, and ensuring legal protection for undocumented “Dreamers.”
We commend the University’s efforts to defend the interests of its community and encourage Harvard to continue doing so. These issues have real implications for many members of our community, and it is crucial that the University supports them. While prevailing political attitudes have become increasingly hostile towards Harvard and other institutions of higher education in the last few years, the University’s steady increase of lobbying funds since 2011 shows its commitment to confronting this challenge head on.
While lobbying funds this year are $10,000 less than last year’s, this decrease does not seem significant or indicative of a shift in stance regarding the intensity of lobbying efforts. Furthermore, we are comforted by Harvard’s reassurances that it is fully committed to continuing the fight against policies in Washington that are dangerous for higher education or students in our community.
In light of this commitment, we encourage the University to specifically continue to prioritize immigration issues, given their tremendous human impact. Harvard has a responsibility to fight to ensure the status of its students, faculty, and staff, and we hope that the University takes up the task at hand with moral conviction and seriousness of purpose. Former University President Drew G. Faust set a precedent of advocating for undocumented members of the Harvard community, and we are pleased to see that so far University President Lawrence S. Bacow has followed her lead.
The University should also continue to combat endowment taxation with the full force of its political clout. Harvard must operate at its full financial capacity to adequately provide the infrastructure and support that faculty, staff, and students depend on every day. The more Harvard receives through its endowment, the more capably it can provide financial aid for students, wages for staff, funding for research, as well as many other provisions for its community.
It is reassuring that lobbying in support of sanctions seems to have taken a backseat to these more important issues. Though our support for the University’s sanctioning of male final clubs remains, we believe that the University should focus its lobbying priorities elsewhere. While the issue is at the heart of debates over social life on campus, concerns for the safety of undocumented students and the integrity of the critical research agendas across the University must take precedence.
While we stand in favor of Harvard’s lobbying practices, it bears mentioning that as a systemic phenomenon, lobbying has a pernicious effect on American politics. It incentivizes politicians to often act on the behalf of donors as opposed to actual constituents, and reform is necessary to cure the many of these problems. Nevertheless, until reform is achieved, Harvard should continue to work within the system to protect members of our community and promote its policy goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Petsi Pies, a bakery beloved by College students and Cantabrigians alike, closed this week after 13 years at its 31 Putnam Ave. location.
Darwin’s — a chain sandwich shop based in Cambridge — moved into Petsi’s old building Saturday.
The Putnam Avenue bakery is the second Petsi Pies location to close in recent years. The first, on Cambridge Street, shut its doors in late August 2018.
Steven and Isabel Darwin, the owners of Darwin’s, purchased 31 Putnam Ave. in 2012 and allowed Petsi, which had leased the first floor from the building’s previous owners, to keep using it. But Petsi owner Renee McLeod decided not to continue renting the space after January 2019, according to Petsi General Manager Jill Remby.
The store’s Somerville location, on Beacon Street, is now Petsi’s only remaining branch.
“It’s much more simple to run one store, and there’s lots of room to grow here,” Remby said in reference to the Somerville Petsi.
In response to the vacancy left by the Putnam Avenue Petsi’s departure, Steven Darwin decided to open a fourth location of his local sandwich franchise.
“The owner of Petsi Pies was not going to renew her lease, so this was going to stop being a Petsi Pies regardless,” Darwin’s employee Savannah Walsh said.
Petsi Pies was popular with Harvard undergraduates, especially those living in Mather House because of its proximity to their residence, students said.
Austin D. Fuller ’21, a Mather House resident who said he frequented Petsi “about once a week,” said he was upset that the store had closed.
“I’m a little disappointed, just because that was a study space for me that wasn’t the Mather Library, which can be a bit depressing if you go there too much,” Fuller said.
Fuller also said the suddenness of the closing surprised him.
“One day they announced it and the next it was closed,” he said.
Though Petsi is no longer at the Putnam Avenue location, Walsh said Darwin’s still attracts some of the College students who had frequented the bakery.
“We’re very popular with Harvard students because of our location,” she said.
Though Petsi Pie fans may miss the bakery's offerings, patrons can still look forward to the cafe’s menu of savory sandwiches and coffees.
Correction: Feb. 13, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Darwin's replacing Petsi Pies is the chain's third location. In fact, the new Darwin's is the chain's fourth location.

Harvard has finished an eight-month renovation of Robinson Hall, the building housing the History Department, according to Associate Dean for Physical Resources and Planning Michael N. Lichten.
The construction project — which lasted from May 2018 to January 2019 — added an elevator, modernized offices and classrooms in the building, and relocated the bathrooms. Before the renovation, Robinson Hall, which dates to the early 20th century, was one of the last buildings in Harvard Yard that was not wheelchair accessible.
“The main driver for renovation was to make the building and the History Department more accessible,” Lichten said in an interview Thursday. “With Robinson Hall, really only the first floor was accessible, but the main departmental office was on the second floor. I think this is a great benefit.”
Some College students said they haven't noticed much change since the completion.
History concentrator Isaac A. Walker ’19 said the new building has made a minimal impact on his time there.
“It hasn't affected my experience much and I'm actually surprised they didn't change more,” he said. “The only major change I’ve noticed is moving the bathrooms.”
During construction, some History classes met in other buildings.
“We had to find a new building for classes during the fall semester,” Lichten said. “A number of faculty had to move to other places. It was too bad we had to inconvenience people, but it was worth it.”
History concentrator William G. Strang ’19 said the construction’s main effect on him was that it relocated some of his courses.
“A lot of my history seminars that would otherwise be in Robinson were in [the Center for Government and International Studies],” he said.
Some students praised the outcome of the renovations. Walker said he is particularly glad the construction did not change the Great Space, a large room in Robinson designed to foster collaboration.
“The Great Space is the most important part and they didn't change that, thankfully,” he said. “It's already a great building to meet people or study, so as long as that doesn't change, I'm happy.”
Though he said the renovation will only affect him a little, Walker said he is glad it will help others.
“Hopefully it will make using the building a more pleasant and modern experience,” he said.
Lichten, too, praised the University’s decision to make the building more accessible.
“Robinson represented the last major building in the Yard without accessibility,” Lichten said. “We’re always trying to listen and see where accessibility can be improved.”

Pulitzer Prize winner and Harvard Law School lecturer Linda J. Greenhouse ’68 spoke to a packed room of University affiliates about the role of the Supreme Court in threatening civil society Wednesday evening.
More than one hundred undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and others gathered at the Law School Library to hear Greenhouse, a former Crimson editor, give the Kissel Lecture in Ethics, an annual talk on the intersection of law and morality. Greenhouse argued that some people have opted out of the norms that historical court cases had adhered to in the past.
“Civil society, by definition, exists outside the formal structures of government,” Greenhouse said. “A democratic society cannot flourish if its citizens pursue their narrow personal interests.”
By linking and scrutinizing recent Supreme Court decisions from Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission to Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Greenhouse argued the Court should consider a moral framework in addition to case law and precedent when deciding cases.
Greenhouse questioned the Court’s past decisions on dismissing certain cases, claiming that these actions can ultimately threaten civil society and affect the daily lives of people not directly involved in the case itself.
“What we are seeing in the Supreme Court’s recent behavior is a threat to the foundation of civil society,” she said. “We as a society are not united in a common cause. We are not all in this together.”
Greenhouse also discussed partisan issues the Supreme Court currently faces, addressing the role of contraceptives, abortion, and religious incentives in relation to court packing. When asked about whether she believed that abortion issues were “red meat” for conservatives to pack the Court, Greenhouse answered affirmatively and referred to her book “Before Roe v. Wade: Voices That Shaped the Abortion Debate Before the Supreme Court’s Ruling.”
College students at the talk had their own opinions on the power of civil society on the Supreme Court’s politics.
“It was a very new angle,” Grace E. Sullivan ’19 said. “I think that addressing the whole weight of the issue to civil society doesn’t speak to the whole partisanship of the Supreme Court, but it is part of the problem.”
Greenhouse said she believes open communication, voting, and “intentionality” are instrumental to addressing the issues she identified within the court system.
“People need to talk about the cases in an open way that links them all together,” she said. “We are afraid to talk about religion and religious claims because they are not seen as polite.”
Attendee Samuel S. Oh ’19 said Greenhouse’s recommendations left him “concerned” for the American population’s faith in the rule of law in the Supreme Court.
“There doesn’t seem to be much else we can do besides each individual following through on their own due diligence,” Oh said.
Lauren D. Spohn ’20, who also attended the talk, said she believes there is still room for hope and improvement and suggested that the United States look toward other federal court models.
“Greenhouse’s response to a few audience questions about the Canadian court system made me think about how we can look outwards for solutions,” Spohn said.
When asked whether she thought that the media should focus on what the Supreme Court is doing well in addition to the aforementioned criticism, Greenhouse responded with a strict “no.”
“When it comes to inspiring faith in the next generation, I don’t think sugarcoating the diagnosis is the way to go. It’s taken a long time to get to this point, and it will take a long time to get it undone,” she said.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow returned to Washington, D.C., for the second time during his presidency to lobby federal lawmakers and a White House staffer to increase research funding, bolster immigration protections, and avoid another government shutdown on Thursday.
The meetings come on the heels of the longest partial government shutdown in U.S. history. The 35-day shutdown left more than 800,000 federal employees either furloughed or forced to work without pay, caused funding lapses, and restricted access to resources used by some Harvard faculty members and graduate students.
“I've talked to them about research funding issues — the importance of continued NIH and NSF funding — trying to get a two-year budget deal so that we don't find ourselves with a sequester again,” Bacow said.
Bacow met with several lawmakers from the House and the Senate across the political spectrum, including U.S. Senators Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), and Roy D. Blunt (R-Mo.), along with Rep. Jim P. McGovern (D-Mass.). Bacow also spoke with Kelvin Droegemeier, the White House’s director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
McGovern wrote in an emailed statement that he was appreciative of Bacow’s visit and is excited to work with him moving forward.
“President Bacow and I had a fantastic meeting where we discussed many of the issues facing higher education institutions in Massachusetts and across America,” McGovern wrote. “I’m grateful he took the time to stop by, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on behalf of students.”
Spokespeople for Romney, Alexander, and Blunt did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
In past visits to Washington, Bacow met privately with legislators like Senate Minority Leader Chuck E. Schumer ’71 (D-N.Y.), U.S. Senator Michael D. Crapo (R-Idaho), and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).
This trip marks Bacow’s first journey to Washington since the U.S. House of Representatives flipped from Republican to Democratic control in January — a shift that Bacow noted did “change things.” Bacow said, however, that the new Congress hasn’t “really changed” his lobbying strategy in Washington.
Similar to previous visits, Bacow lobbied against an excise tax on some universities’ — including Harvard’s — endowment returns that will likely cost the University between $40 million and $50 million per year. He also made the case for continued research funding and for protections for students in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — an Obama-era measure that allows undocumented youth to live and work in the United States — and workers with Temporary Protected Status.
Regarding the endowment tax, Bacow said that “it’s difficult to predict at this point” the future of the tax.
“At a time in which other countries are supporting their universities, we are taxing ours,” Bacow said. “And in a world that is increasingly competitive, especially, literally a global market for academic talent, this is not helpful.”
The University previously stated that they hadn’t yet received guidance on how to file its taxes with the new levy in place. As of Thursday, Bacow said that was still the case, though the University still has a few months before it needs to file that particular tax for the first time.
“We are still awaiting final regulations from the Treasury Department,” he said.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow discussed the challenges higher education institutions face and defended Harvard’s leading role among colleges and universities at an American Enterprise Institute and Brookings Institution panel Thursday.
The panel — which included education policy experts from Georgetown University, the Urban Institute, and Strada Education Network — focused on the future of higher education and the issues the industry faces in contemporary times.
Bacow discussed a number problems Harvard itself is facing, among them accusations of elitism and political bias as universities across the country are facing a hostile political climate. Defending the University against these sentiments is nothing new for Bacow — he has spent months traveling across the country to cities like San Diego, Calif. and his hometown of Pontiac, Mich. to make the case for Harvard to people in all parts of the country.
“We are perceived as being elite institutions at a time in which the word ‘elite’ has become a bad word when applied to anything but a quarterback,” Bacow said.
Bacow also noted that a “challenge” for institutions like Harvard is that they are seen as self-serving, rather than focused on public service. Since taking office, Bacow has publicly pledged his support for public service internships — which are often low-paying or unpaid summer positions — for every undergraduate who would like to pursue a position in that sector.
Bacow also addressed concerns that Harvard leans too liberal, mentioning several prominent conservative speakers that have visited campus in the past few years including U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos and professor Charles A. Murray. He stressed that there has never been “a speaker shouted down at Harvard or somebody who was unable to speak.”
Though Bacow underscored the importance of engaging with and responding to criticisms against Harvard and other universities, he also defended the role research universities play in the world.
“It’s the ability to aggregate and concentrate and create human capital that determines the wealth of nations and regions, and what the great research universities do is exactly that,” Bacow said.
“We are the sink at the end of the rest of the world’s brain drain,” he added. “They send us their best and their brightest and many of them never want to leave and they stay and they enrich not only our institutions, they enrich this country.”
Brain drain is the phenomenon of students from around the world coming to study at universities like Harvard and deciding to remain after graduation, rather than returning home with their degrees.
During the roughly one hour and fifteen minute panel, Bacow touched upon a number of Harvard-specific issues that he has had to face down during his first year as University President. He focused on a new $40 million to $50 million tax on Harvard’s endowment and an ongoing anti-affirmative action lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its College admissions processes.
When a discussion about admissions surfaced, Bacow brought up the lawsuit and defended the University’s position.
“We’ve spent millions of dollars defending against the lawsuit, that I think many of you are aware of, in which we’ve made the case that… we are all more than just our numbers, that it shouldn’t be reduced to just one’s grades and SAT scores,” Bacow said.
During the discussion, moderator Richard V. Reeves of the Brookings Institution pressed Bacow on a number of points, including Bacow’s argument that students in the U.S. “can get a great education” and “succeed” after going to almost any institution.
“Having an Ivy League degree definitely helps,” Reeves countered.
Bacow responded by saying he was “proud” when he was president of Tufts that “three of the Fortune 50o CEOs were Tufts graduates.”
Bacow also talked about the importance of creating broad access to higher education across the country.
“Historically, the nation’s colleges and universities have enabled the American Dream,” he said. “It’s important that all of us work to continue to ensure that opportunity exists for future generations, just as it was created for so many of us who are privileged to be sitting in this room.”

Harvard astronomers have identified a cosmic signature that might help scientists understand the origins of the universe.
The findings, co-developed by Astronomy Lecturer Xiangang Chen, Astronomy Department Chair Avi Loeb, and Physics postdoctoral fellow Zhong-Zhi Xianyu, have been accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters as an “Editors’ Suggestion” — a distinction awarded to one in six “outstanding” papers.
The paper provides a possible test to determine what happened before the Big Bang. The question of what preceded the event has long puzzled physicists and astronomers alike. Scientists are generally divided into two camps: inflationists and contractionists.
Those who advocate for inflation believe the universe underwent a period of exponential expansion at its inception, while those who subscribe to the theory of contraction assert that the universe goes through cyclic periods of contraction and slow expansion.
Inflation theory is more popular among academics because it serves as a more “elegant” explanation of the universe’s inception, according to Chen. But Chen and his colleagues argue that more rigorous testing is needed to determine the validity of the theory.
“Scientific theory is not a beauty contest,” Chen said. “You cannot just say, this theory is elegant, so it must be right. You have to derive the consequences and derive experiments to test it.”
Over the past few years, Chen and his colleagues developed the idea that primordial standard clocks — heavy particles existing before the Big Bang that swung back and forth like pendulum clocks — would have left distinctive imprints on the universe that could be used to differentiate between the contraction and inflation models.
Chen compared the primordial standard clocks to a watch in a film.
“All the information we have about the primordial universe is like a movie, but we only have the stack of frames,” Chen said. “But somehow that stack of frames gets messed up, and we don’t know how to run the movie. Should I run this backwards or forwards?”
He explained that astronomers could theoretically determine the direction of the film, or the universe, by following the ticking of the watch.
The debate about the falsifiability of inflation started in 2017, when Loeb — along with Princeton professor Paul J. Steinhardt and then-Princeton postdoctoral fellow Anna Ijjas — wrote an article in Scientific American in which they challenged the dominance of the inflationist theory.
“One of the inevitable consequences of inflation is the notion of the multiverse. Anything that can happen will happen an infinite number of times,” Loeb said. “So is inflation really falsifiable? We think that a scientific theory is one that you can falsify. If inflation can accommodate anything, it’s a problem."
The 2017 piece provoked what Loeb characterized as a “odd” response from Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Alan H. Guth — a letter co-signed by 32 of Guth’s colleagues, including Stephen Hawking and five Nobel Prize Laureates.
“People — especially people that invented inflation — got really upset, and said that it cannot be falsified, it must be true, it should be true, and therefore there is no need to test it because it must be true,” Loeb said.
Guth wrote in an email that he has never argued that inflation “cannot or should not be tested.”
Loeb said Guth’s letter prompted them to search for a way to test the theory of inflation, leading them to publish their most recent paper.
Loeb said he hopes the data needed to complete the test will come within the next decade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Arborists have recommended that a century-old oak tree at Harvard Divinity School be removed, the University announced Thursday evening.
The tree's future has sparked controversy since last year when the Divinity School announced plans to remove it ahead of implementing the Andover Project, a long-desired renovation of the school’s main campus building, Andover Hall.
Andrew Balon, an arborist representative from Bartlett Tree Experts, the firm commissioned by the University to evaluate the tree, examined the tree's condition.
He said the tree is in “irreversible decline” and poses “high risk” for buildings and pedestrians, an assessment that validates an earlier review of the tree’s health.
In an email sent to Divinity School students Thursday, the school wrote that “beginning immediately, access to the area around the tree will be restricted.” The email also said that overhead protection will also be installed allowing safe entry into Andover-Harvard Theological Library.
At a two-hour Agassiz Neighborhood Council meeting — attended by Harvard administrators and students, along with Cambridge residents — the announcement of the tree’s impending removal elicited varied reactions from participants.
While some people accepted the arborist’s assessment of the tree, many said they regretted the fate of the oak.
“To think that this tree will come down just breaks my heart, but you know and I even hate to say, but if there is a silver lining, this campus’ awareness about the importance of trees has been raised,” Divinity School student Gretchen T. Legler said.
“It was not what we wanted, but it was what we would have to accept,” said Richard M. Barran, a resident who lives nearby, of the tree's removal.
Last week, the Cambridge City Council delayed voting on a moratorium on cutting down trees for one year due to concerns over the lack of public input. The moratorium could prohibit the University from taking down trees if it is passed in the future.
Frederick R. "Fred" Meyer — a Divinity and Law School alumnus — moderated the council and said the meeting brought together members of the community to facilitate conversation about the scheduled felling of the tree and the University’s renovation plans.
“People listen to each other, and there was some bad news that surprised me. But I think people took it very well because Harvard has done its part in getting further research and getting another arborist,” Meyer said.
The meeting's participants raised multiple questions about the possibility of maintaining the tree instead of removing it. They also asked about a replacement tree and Harvard’s procedures for preserving its tree canopy.
Mediation techniques – including pruning, cabling, bracing, and transplantation – will not work due to the tree’s condition, Balon said.
Divinity School spokesperson Michael P. Naughton wrote in an emailed statement that the Divinity School has a long comittment to "sustainability and resilience."
"Throughout the past decade, it has contributed significantly to the tree canopy of Cambridge by planting 123 trees across its campus, while only removing four unhealthy and potentially unsafe trees,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven years ago this week, an unheralded point guard from Harvard catalyzed the Knicks to a 99-92 victory over NBA All-Star Deron Williams and the Nets at Madison Square Garden. Scoring 25 points, five rebounds, and seven assists off of the bench — all career highs — undrafted Jeremy Lin quickly became one of the most popular players, and people, in New York City.
The phenomenon known as “Linsanity” thrust the Torrance, Calif., native into the global spotlight in the world’s most famous arena, and fueled an NBA career that is now in its ninth season.
During a three-week stretch for the Knicks, Lin became a household name across New York and NBA-watching households — during the first 10 games of Linsanity, the former Crimson guard averaged 24.6 points and 9.2 assists, shooting nearly 50 percent from the field. The fervor, both in New York, and internationally, caused then-commissioner David Stern to say that, “No player has created the interest and the frenzy in this short period of time, in any sport that I'm aware of, like Jeremy Lin has.”
Lin, the first American of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to ever play in the NBA, stoked a cult following almost immediately, which eventually culminated in the production of the film “Linsanity”. In February of 2012 alone, Lin was largely responsible for boosting the market capitalization of the Madison Square Garden Company, by over 250 million dollars. No NBA jersey sold more than Lin’s No. 17 through February and March of that season. 
Lin is often credited with drawing attention to, and helping bolster the competitiveness of Ivy League basketball. Lin remains the only Ancient Eight alumnus active as a player in the NBA, and is undoubtedly responsible for the increasingly competitive recruiting and performance of Ivy League basketball teams. The ninth-year pro, who now plays for the Atlanta Hawks, is quick to deflect the praise to Coach Tommy Amaker.
“He’s been the ultimate game changer for the Harvard basketball program,” Lin said about Coach Amaker. “He will try to say it’s me — it’s not, it’s him, and he’s the one who turned everything around.”
Regardless of his modest outlook, it is difficult to overstate the sensation that Lin became, practically overnight. After just 12 starts before the All-Star Break, Lin was selected as a last-minute addition to the Rising Stars Challenge, a testament to the rapid ascent of Lin’s stock. In the years following Lin’s emergence, the Harvard basketball program successfully recruited multiple Top 100 high school players, including the vaunted Class of 2020 — dubbed the best recruiting class in the history of Harvard basketball.
“Proud of him and his journey,” said Coach Amaker on Lin’s journey. “You know, what he’s been able to accomplish, on and off the court.”
By the end of the 2012 NBA season, Lin had gone from an undrafted D-Leaguer playing with the Warriors’ Reno Bighorns affiliate, to the second most popular jersey in the NBA, behind only Derrick Rose. The renewed attention that Lin brought the Knicks also played a significant role in breaking a 48-day dispute between Time Warner Cable and the MSG Network, preventing many New Yorkers from watching Knicks games.
Although Lin’s success in the Big Apple was in large part a month-long phenomenon, the 30 year-old has since built a solid career in the League, averaging double-digit scoring in each of his eight seasons with the Knicks, Rockets, Lakers, Hornets, Nets, and his new team, the Atlanta Hawks.
And while Lin’s future with Atlanta is tenuous, as he remains on the last year of his contract and plays for a team that will likely look to swap expiring assets for draft picks, he values the impact that his experience can have on a younger Hawks team. For once in his career, with a team focused around rookies Trae Young, Kevin Huerter and other young players like John Collins, Lin plays the role of veteran NBA player, helping mentor the youthful Hawks. He’s played in 17 playoff games, and averaged over 10 points per game in three postseason stints with the Rockets and Hornets — opportunities that few in Atlanta have experienced.
Despite graduating from Harvard in 2010, Lin has been in the spotlight on campus more recently, because of a million-dollar donation to the college that he made in October of 2016, after signing a three-year contract with the Brooklyn Nets. Much of the coverage about his donation focused on the completion of the Lavietes Pavilion reconstruction, which was a long-awaited process for the Athletics Department. A significant portion of Lin’s million-dollar donation, however, was directed towards the college’s financial aid program. 
“I wanted to give back to the team and also help others,” Lin said of his donation. “I was a financial aid person and I needed a lot of help, and my grandma helped me get through one of those years and it took plenty of loans and things like that. I don’t want to forget where I come from.”
Lin’s role in the NBA is, in itself, a bit of a contradiction. In the post-Linsanity era, he has settled into his role as a highly capable role player off of the bench, for one of the NBA’s least appealing teams. A far cry from his three weeks in the New York City spotlight, Lin still remains an icon to many — both as a Taiwanese/Chinese American, and as the only representative of the Ivy League on basketball’s biggest stage. In essence, Lin is both just an every-day rotational NBA player, while simultaneously representing much more than that.
But make no mistake about Lin’s legacy. Since arriving in the NBA, Lin has never shied away from the opportunities provided to him by one of the world’s most popular sports leagues to make his opinions heard. In an era in which politicians and pundits have frequently chastised players for taking public views on inflammatory issues, Lin is no stranger to controversy.
Since his arrival in the League, Lin has been outspoken on issues from discrimination against Asian-Americans, and has been subject to multiple offensive comments by sports media and journalism personalities. As a member of the Brooklyn Nets, Lin penned an article titled “So… About My Hair” for the Players Tribune, explaining his choice to wear dreadlocks, arguing for the importance of different minorities sharing their cultures with each other.
“The conversations I had weren’t always very comfortable, and at times I know I didn’t say the right things,” wrote Lin, in the Players Tribune article. “But I’m glad I had them — because I know as an Asian-American how rare it is for people to ask me about my heritage beyond a surface level.”
Long before gaining the platform to speak, Lin was an unknown high school basketball player from California, born to two Taiwanese emigrants, who were both only 5 feet 6 inches. Born in the Los Angeles area, Lin’s family moved to Palo Alto, where he learned to play basketball at a local YMCA with his brothers.
Despite captaining Palo Alto High School to a 32-1 record in his senior year and a California Division II State Championship victory over nationally-ranked powerhouse Mater Dei, Lin did not receive a single athletic scholarship to play Division I basketball. Unrecruited by local schools Cal-Berkeley and Stanford, who encouraged him to walk on, Lin found himself at Harvard, one of the few schools that showed interest in the 6’3 guard.
“Those four years there turned me into somebody different,” Lin said of his time at Harvard. “Tommy and the organization, they gave me a chance to develop into my own and really have a chance, and I was able to play in the NBA because of the growth I was able to make as a player and as a person, at that school on that team.” 
Lamar Reddicks, a former assistant coach for the Crimson, described Lin as “the weakest guy on the team”, in his freshman year. Even after garnering three All-Ivy recognitions, including two unanimous first-team selections his junior and senior seasons, Lin went undrafted, despite being invited to eight pre-draft workouts. One of the 11 finalists for the Bob Cousy Award, presented to the nation’s best college point guard, Lin eventually signed with his hometown Warriors, but received little playing time while backing up Stephen Curry and Monta Ellis.
A year and a half later, after stints with the Warriors, Rockets, and a patellar ligament injury, Lin found himself in the spotlight on the NBA’s biggest stage — as starting point guard for the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
In many ways, Lin’s story is emblematic of so much that is beautiful about sports. The belief that anyone, regardless of background or circumstances, can rise to prominence with the right amount of hard work and determination, is a cliché that frequently appears throughout American sports culture. Perhaps it’s Lin’s status as an underdog that made his popularity so contagious. The idea that a first generation American could rise to become one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People, and compile a long NBA career after attending Harvard, is as compelling a storyline as could ever be scripted.
“Jeremy is a wonderful guy, he's had an amazing career thus far,” Coach Amaker said. “He's going to do even greater things beyond and off the court.”
Lin’s popularity and ascension to worldwide fame is undeniable, especially to the Chinese and Taiwanese American communities, for which he represents the first to ever play in the NBA. Even more impressive, however, is the fact that despite his success and unique story, Lin has never forgotten where he came from. His generous donation to the college’s financial aid program are a literal reminder of this, but even a brief conversation with him is enough to convey his love for Harvard and the basketball team.
“It’s just different, you know, the whole experience is different,you’re kind of redefining what it means,” said Lin of his experience in Ivy League basketball. “You can take this path and go to the NBA, you can be a student athlete.”
With the trade deadline looming this afternoon, there is a very real possibility that Lin will play for another team by the end of today. After this season, Lin will be an unrestricted free agent, free to pursue whatever options the market offers him. So, once again, the former Crimson point guard will be faced with the uncertainty that has repeatedly appeared throughout his basketball career. But you can rely on Lin to approach the deadline and impending free agency with the same humility and grace he’s brought to the hardwood since he was learning to dribble and shoot at the Bay Area YMCA.
“He has that kind of personality and also you know what's in his heart you know to be a good person,” Coach Amaker said. “We talk all the time about it here — he's doing it, not just to do well, but also to do good. Jeremy's doing both, and we're proud of that.”
At some point in his life, once his NBA career is over, many expect Lin to become increasingly involved in social activism. It’s reasonable to say that, while his Harvard education has yet to benefit him in the league, it will in his life after basketball. Wherever his experiences take him, Lin will bring his four years of basketball in Cambridge, and over 10-year NBA career to the table — which is something few people have ever experienced.
“I’m sure my degree will come into play somewhere down the road,” Lin said. “Although right now it doesn’t really help me with getting buckets or winning game.”
Whether it’s for the Hawks, or another team for the rest of the season and beyond, you can count on Lin to worry about winning games. But anyone who’s met the 30 year-old that took the world by storm seven years ago, knows that Lin’s future is much brighter than just basketball.
But for now, he’ll be focused on getting buckets — in Atlanta, or wherever the trade deadline may take him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The score is 10-4 in the third game of a hard fought match between Harvard freshman Marwan Tarek and Trinity senior Tom De Mulder. After a long rally, Tarek chips a cross-court drop shot that just evades De Mulder’s outstretched racket, claiming a 11-6, 11-5, 11-4 victory.
This performance was emblematic of the No. 1 Harvard’s (11-0, 5-0 Ivy) as a whole, as the team took eight matches to the No. 2 Trinity College Bantams’ (14-2) one in the most significant matchup of their season. This victory preserved their number one position in the standings.
“Trinity is one of the biggest teams in college squash,” said Tarek, the owner of an individual undefeated season. “We haven’t won against them since 2014, so we knew that this was a big day.”
As such, the team put a little extra consideration into their preparation in the days before the match.
“I have to give Coach all the credit,” said Tarek, a Cairo, Egypt native. “He makes sure that we prepare for every single match, taking on all opponents equally, but for Trinity’s match we had some additional morning meetings to motivate each other. We really mentally prepared for this match.”
Tarek’s match in the No. 2 position was quite well-contested, but he was able to pull away from his opponent in each game after the first few points went back-and-forth. He attributed this performance to the mental preparation that the Crimson squad engaged in.
“The mental side is a big part of my game,” he offered. “In every single point, I have to believe that I am going to win the point, even if it is 50 or more rallies long. I have this belief that I am going to get out of this point as the winner, that I want to end this point in my favor.”
As for the rest of the team, freshman Victor Crouin defeated Trinity junior Kush Kumar 11-5, 11-4, 11-4 in the No. 1 position, and junior Timothy Brownell rounded out Harvard’s top three with a 11-9, 12-10, 11-5 victory against Trinity junior Thoboki Mohohlo. The remainder of the Crimson’s top six — sophomore Samuel Scherl, and juniors Saadeldin Abouaish and Sean Hughes — finished their matches in three games as well.
Beyond their performances on the court, Tarek noted that the upperclassmen played a role in calming the nerves of the younger players.
“The upperclassmen had a big role in teaching us freshmen how to take the pressure off,” noted the two-time Egyptian National Champion. “We have three freshmen playing in the top nine, so the upperclassmen were always encouraging us to play our best and fight, regardless of the outcome of the game. You can’t find a great team without people who always have each other’s backs.”
On the women’s side, No. 1 Harvard (8-0, 5-0 Ivy) put up an equally dominant performance, if not more so. The team swept No. 3 Trinity’s squad (12-2), taking all nine matches and maintaining their top spot in the rankings.
“It went pretty well today,” said sophomore Hannah Craig, who won her match 11-5, 11-7, 11-6 in the No. 9 slot. “We were prepared going in, and we fought really hard. We never underestimate the Trinity team because they are always very strong.”
Going into the matchup, the team knew that they were in for tough competition, and used this for added motivation.
“We always embrace the challenge,” said Craig, a Belfast, Northern Ireland native. “What’s fun about playing Trinity is that they’re always strong players. It’s always an exciting match for us.”
Craig’s opponent was an aggressive player, so over the course of the match, she had to display patience and resilience.
“She was an Egyptian squash player, so she would put a lot of pace on the ball,” Craig said. “She was hustling and trying to step up and volley a lot. For me, it was about hitting straight lines, hitting under a lot of pressure, varying the pace of the ball, and being patient. I let her take the crazy shots and stayed calm while waiting for my opportunities.”
Craig, like Tarek, also cited the mental game as a factor that impacted the performance of the Crimson’s players against the Bantams.
“There were a lot of clashes during the matches, because squash is so one-on-one that you’re always up in each other’s faces,” she offered. “What was important was staying strong in those moments — keeping focused, taking breaths, and continuing to fight. We’ve been working on mental strength.”
As for the rest of the team, senior Sabrina Sobhy continued her undefeated season and won her match in the No. 1 position 11-6, 11-3, 11-7 against Trinity freshman Luz Sahari Lopez. Junior Gina Kennedy defeated sophomore Min Jie Teh 11-7, 11-6, 11-6, while junior Amelia Henley rounded off the top three with a 12-10, 11-7, 12-10 victory in a very close match against junior Salma Alam El Din.
Both teams will face Yale at home on Thursday before heading to Providence to take on Brown on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night, a dozen or so NBA scouts descended upon Lavietes Pavilion as Harvard men’s basketball hosted Yale in front of a sell-out crowd. The prized target was not dressed in a crimson uniform but rather Yale’s junior standout Miye Oni, who had been turning heads with his versatile scoring and lengthy frame.
But while the Bulldogs’ wing had a largely quiet night, it was someone in the home white unis that was quickly making an impression. Like Oni, this Crimson player stood out for his enormous wingspan, ability to defend multiple positions, and rebounding aggressiveness. By the 16-minute mark of the second half, he had drained his career-high fourth triple of the contest — which in fact surpassed Oni’s scoring total for the entirety of the game.
That final trey? An electrifying corner shot in front of the Crimson bench, in which he made sure to acknowledge with a loud roar and head-bob before rushing back the other end. This would complete his third of four games with 20-plus minutes of playing time, three of which he finished in double-digits.
Enter Robert Baker.
Listed as 6-foot-11, 205 pounds, the Woodstock, Ga., native and all-time leading scorer at The Walker School immediately stands out to onlookers with his slender, physical frame. For those who follow the NBA, including Baker himself, there are immediate resemblances when juxtaposing playing styles.
“Anthony Davis, Kevin Durant, Giannis [Antetokounmpo] a little bit in transition,” Baker said. “And then old guys like James Worthy and Kevin McHale.”
In fact, the junior’s original selection of his jersey number, 35, can be attributed to the athlete colloquially known as “KD.” On Jan. 28, the two-time NBA Champion and 2014 MVP stepped inside Lavietes Pavilion for a post-Celtics game practice, and posed for pictures with Harvard’s 35 afterwards. Baker admitted he had other initial inclinations in choosing his Crimson jersey number, but nevertheless embraces Durant as a role model.
“I didn’t really want 35, they kind of gave me 35 honestly,” Baker said. “I really wanted to wear number 5 or 15, but they didn’t have that available. But wearing 35 is definitely because of [Durant], similar body types and similar skill sets. He’s definitely on a whole other level, but [I am] trying to get there, trying to be like him, trying to model my game after him.”
Unlike the 2008 NBA Rookie of the Year, though, Baker’s emergence into college basketball was anything but smooth sailing. Ranked as the 97th player coming out of high school in ESPN’s 2016 Top 100, the Winthrop resident did not earn comparable playing time to the other highly-touted freshmen in his class — one that included immediate starters Chris Lewis, Seth Towns, and Bryce Aiken.
In his first season, Baker averaged just 2.8 points in 8.4 minutes per game, posting a career-high eight points late into the season against Penn. Sophomore year ended in similar results, as it appeared as if Baker was becoming coach Tommy Amaker’s high-energy insert for a few minutes off of the bench.
“It definitely didn't start the way the way I pictured it,” Baker said. “But it's all about fitting into roles. And that's something you have to come to embrace. When you come from high school to college, there are many guys better than you were, more skilled. But it's all about learning and getting better each and every day. And sooner or later, you're going to have a chance to make your impact by taking advantage of your opportunities.”
And finally, it appears as if the opportunity has arrived for “Bobby Buckets.” As someone who “wears his emotions on his sleeve”, according to classmate Justin Bassey, and always seemed to have a joy and ease to his demeanor, it was never the attitude that limited Baker’s playing time. Instead, the Atlanta native has earned a spot in the starting lineup recently due to his energy off the glass and defensive prowess, affirmed by teammates and coaching staff.
“I think he's just oozing with confidence right now,” junior big Henry Welsh said. “Ever since he came into the starting role again he's really just been doing an awesome job and he's always been a phenomenal player, I think the confidence is what puts him over the top.” 
“I think Rob is really one of our X factors in our games, as far as him playing well and how much that can be a lift to our team on the backboard [and] affecting shots with his length,” added starting guard Christian Juzang, who has also progressed from bench role-player to a trusted starter for Amaker. “He is one of those guys that when he makes plays, it means a lot. I've been really close with him since day one so to have him back in the rotation...it’s always fun.”
From a statistical standpoint, Baker is one of the Crimson’s most efficient players — particularly in metrics outside of scoring. The junior trails only Bassey on the team in defensive rebounds per game at 3.5, and has accumulated 12 blocks this season, or 2.0 per 40 minutes. When accounting for his combined body of work, Baker is the second-most efficient Harvard player with a PER of 20.1.
Numbers-wise, perhaps the badge of honor is Baker’s team-high total rebounding percentage of 17.8%, one that represents in cold numbers the more intangible awareness and toughness on the boards. In short, expect the 6-foot-11 stretch big to be on the receiving end of the most rebounds while on the court.
Furthermore, his willingness to shoot from deep and recent success rate has improved significantly from earlier in the season. Having attempted just seven threes in the first 11 games of the season and converting one, Baker has seen the rim open up as of late. Since the UNC contest on Jan 3., the wing has knocked down 11 of 21 three-point attempts, catapulting his season average to just shy of 43 percent.
Numbers aside, Baker has much room left to grow in his final season-and-change for the Crimson. From a physical standpoint, he has already bulked up at least 15 pounds from his freshman year biography. It will be his continued improvement offensively that will make it even scarier for his opponents heading into senior year.
“Just rebounding and effort,” said Baker when asked about his recent slew of success. “But that's why I'm in there and my presence on the defensive end. I got to improve on the offensive glass [and] taking smarter shots. Just efficiency as a whole has got to improve, but why I think I’m in this is because of my defensive rebounding and defensive presence.”
For his coach, it is all about consistency that will set in stone his place in the opening lineup.
“You achieve a little something like that whether it's a starting position, and you've done what we need you to do to get that,” Amaker said. “Now that you got that you want to do something different. We need them to stay consistent with what we need him to do and if he does that, you know he makes a big difference for our team.”
As this season has progressed and Baker has made a welcome stride in his development, a few things remains constant for the man with “EZ” in his Twitter handle: a laid-back passion for the game and an ability to provide an instant jolt of energy to the Crimson.
If one needs a word to describe his play, Baker himself encapsulated it this past November with one word: “supercharged.”
Correction: Feb. 8, 2019
A previous version of the article stated that Baker was second in defensive rebounding to Chris Lewis. In fact, Justin Bassey leads the team in that category, at 5.5/game, as of Feb 8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team (11-7-3, 8-5-2 ECAC) hosts No. 20 Union (13-8-5, 6-7-1) on Friday night hoping to bounce back from a disheartening loss to Boston College in Monday's Beanpot semifinal game. The No. 17 Crimson, only recently regaining its ranked status, needs several more marquee wins to cement its legitimacy among the NCAA's best, now that its Beanpot hopes have vanished.
While plenty of hockey remains to be played, Harvard's performance against a formidable conference opponent on Friday will have bearings on its outlook down the stretch of the regular season. Senior net-minder Michael Lackey (11-6-3, 2.13 GAA, .925 SV%) will need to continue his stingy play of late — and the squad's nation-best powerplay (32.4%) will need to rebound from an unfruitful contest on Monday — as the Crimson look to mount a late-season run.
The Dutchmen enter Friday's tilt with an equal sense of urgency, still sitting below the .500 mark in the ECAC and on the precipice of ranked and unranked. Union will rely on its balanced top-six and sturdy goaltending to lead the way in this contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Monday’s discouraging semifinal loss in the Beanpot Tournament, the Harvard men’s hockey team came up empty on crucial powerplay opportunities and failed to claw back against eventual victor Boston College. The Crimson’s man-up unit, ranked atop the nation, went a frustrating 0-for-4 as Harvard’s Beanpot hopes were squelched.
Friday, the No. 17 Crimson (12-7-3, 9-5-2 ECAC) returned to conference action against No. 20 Union (13-9-5, 6-8-1) and, ironically, rode its powerplay to victory. Harvard potted four goals with the extra-man en route to a 5-3 triumph at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
“Obviously, it was a tough one Monday,” junior defenseman Adam Fox said. “But we still have a season that we have to focus on. We have to win some games to put ourselves in good position not only in the league but in the Pairwise [rankings]…. So it was definitely a big win for us coming off that loss.”
The ECAC foes entered the third period tied at three apiece. Six minutes into the final frame, the Crimson powerplay took the ice for the fourth time, having struck on each of its prior three opportunities.
After faking a shot from his right-circle office, sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh skated across the slot before threading a cross-ice pass to a waiting Casey Dornbach, who buried the open-goal chance.
The freshman’s fifth tally of the year proved to be the game-winner, as senior net-minder Michael Lackey (3 GA, .880 SV%) and the Harvard defense held strong for the final 14 minutes. An empty-net finisher from junior forward Frédéric Grégoire sealed the victory — the Crimson’s fifth over a ranked opponent in 2018-2019.
“[Fox] passed it up top, and I kind of made a fake and was looking to shoot,” Walsh said. “[I] just kept moving wide, and I heard [Dornbach] call for it, and I knew that that seam was going to be open…. It was a good shot by him, and [there was] a lot of space created by the other guys out there as well.”
With the powerplay firing on all cylinders, several of Harvard’s key offensive pieces put forth stellar performances. Most notably, Fox pocketed four assists, while fellow powerplay point man, Walsh, also contributed two helpers. Dornbach, in his own right, finished with a goal and a pair of apples.
In short, the Crimson’s powerplay won it the game on Friday night. The bout’s first period was no exception to this reality. After converting on its first man-up chance earlier in the frame, Harvard received another opportunity that would take it through the period horn. Assistant coach Rob Rassey’s second 5-on-4 unit, however, had other plans.
From down on the ice, sophomore forward Jack Badini batted the puck out of midair, pocketing a gritty goal with just seven seconds remaining in the stanza and sending his team into the locker room after 20 minutes with the one-score lead.
“Like we’ve said all year, our mindset is getting the puck to the net and getting those second-chance opportunities,” Fox said. “It’s not going to work every night — that’s just hockey — but it’s good when your powerplay can come through for you.”
The Crimson’s advantage held for 10 minutes in the second frame before Union forward Ryan Walker blasted a wrist shot past Lackey to even the ledger. The senior’s snipe was a direct result of linemate Cole Maier’s clean offensive-zone faceoff win.
Neither team was finished scoring in the middle period. With four minutes to go, the Dutchmen claimed their first lead of the night courtesy of senior defenseman Greg Campbell. Two minutes later, Harvard freshman Jack Drury snuck a puck past sophomore backstop Darion Hanson (4 GA, .867 SV%) for yet another Crimson powerplay goal.
Fox achieved his 10th multi-point performance of the season with the primary assist on Drury’s nifty move down low. The Hobey Baker candidate now ranks second in assists per game (1.09) and third in points per game (1.41) nationwide. He also paces college hockey in powerplay points per game (0.82).
“There’s a lot of talented players out there,” coach Donato said. “Any powerplay that has 18 [Fox] on it is going to be pretty good to start. Adam Fox is just great. Everybody is sharing the puck, and I think you can probably see that by the goal scorers. We didn’t just score on the same play.”
In need of a bounce-back performance after its Beanpot semifinal loss, the Crimson broke open the scoring at the midway point of the first period. On the team’s first powerplay of the evening, Fox fired a wrist shot through traffic that was redirected by co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage to give his team the 1-0 lead.
With the tally, the hosts put Monday’s defeat behind them and returned to their usual potency on the man advantage — one which would reappear throughout the contest. After a robust 4-for-4 outing, Harvard’s powerplay still leads the nation with its 36 percent clip.
“Sometimes when you lose an emotional game like the Beanpot, you’re down and out,” coach Donato said. “Having a team that you know is very good coming in is necessary to get the focus you need."
Union would go on to tie the game six minutes later, after a stint of 4-on-4 hockey opened up space on the ice for junior winger Anthony Rinaldi to sneak a wrap-around past the far-side pad of Lackey. Co-captain Michael Floodstrand was involved in the play leading to the 4-on-4: a skirmish in front of the Dutchmen net forced the officials to send both players off.
The Crimson now shifts its focus back to the Beanpot. On Monday, it will duel Boston University for third place in the annual Boston classic. And despite the minimal appeal of a consolation game in a mostly empty National Hockey League arena, Harvard knows that each game counts toward its case for a top spot in the Pairwise rankings — the key to an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.
“Last year was a little bit of a different case because at that point we kind of knew we had no shot at making an at-large bid [to the NCAA Tournament],” Walsh said. “We’ve still got plenty of games left, and we’re definitely making a run at a top-13, even top-10, Pairwise [ranking]. Every game is huge for us. Obviously, no ECAC points on Monday, but we need the win for Pairwise.”

Sections
Harvard University Dining Services may not always have the ~best~ options, but let’s all agree that Sunday Brunch (especially at the Berg) is the actual best and the highlight of the culinary week.
The Options
Sunday Brunch. You walk in anytime from 11:30 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. For those late risers (aka the people who may have partied a bit too hard last night), this delicious meal has all the best HUDS has to offer.
Veritaffles 
Waiting in line for these bad boys is totally worth it, I promise. The strategy to the perfect Veritaffle is to wait a bit, then have the griddle warmed up and lathered with enough residual oil that you don’t have to use spray. That way, you can ensure the perfect amount of Harvard branding on your newly minted meal. But be strategic about this. I usually make my Veritaffle and keep an eye on the line after my smoked salmon bagel, another HUDS culinary phenom.
Smoked Salmon 
Since I’m a pescatarian, I usually don’t find much HUDS food that I like. Is Red’s Best Catch truly the best? Maybe not, but the smoked salmon makes brunch worth it. By the way, here’s a tip: Don’t skip out on toasting your bagel — what you lose in time, you gain in taste.
Biscuits 
Another cult favorite? The biscuits. Whether you have them with gravy or grape preserves, they’re the perfect match for Dutch apple pancakes and any pasta choice.
The Leisure
Sunday brunch is the optimal time to rehash your weekend adventures and catch up with friends. It’s the perfect way to start your day before you realize you have a p-set due on Monday.
So go grab a tray and pile on the chocolate muffins or the multigrain penne chicken broccoli alfredo, and get your Sunday off to the right start you deserve.
