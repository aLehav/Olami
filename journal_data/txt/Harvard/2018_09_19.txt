After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2009, when the financial crisis hit the University, HUDS eliminated hot breakfast in the upperclassmen Houses. This move saved the University a significant sum of money — an estimated $900,000 a year — at a time when financial conservatism was necessary. While we understand the rationale behind this decision in the context of the financial crisis, we believe that it is now time to reinstate hot breakfast in the Houses.
It has been nearly 10 years since the decision to remove hot breakfast from all dining halls, save freshman dining hall Annenberg. In that time, the University has moved beyond the difficulties of the recession and — despite recent trouble with endowment — seen financial growth. Hot breakfast no longer poses the financial burden it once did, and the University can now afford to provide students with heartier breakfast options.
We believe that a return to dining hall hot breakfast would encourage more students to participate in the most important meal of the day. Indeed, a 2016 UC survey indicated that more upperclassmen would eat in the morning if hot breakfast was reinstated. After eating a full, healthy breakfast, students will be more prepared for the classes they have that day. Students are better equipped to get the most out of their education when they are not distracted by hunger, and more enticing breakfast options could help promote regularized eating schedules.
Part of the rationale for the original move away from hot breakfast was that only 30 percent of students reportedly ate breakfast when hot breakfast options were available. Should the College find that putting hot breakfast in every dining hall is underutilized, a one-House-per-neighborhood rollout could be employed. Putting hot breakfast in one third of the Houses creates an almost perfect student to breakfast ratio. This would give students the opportunity to conveniently access hot breakfast without the University wasting excess food or funds.
Furthermore, we believe that any hot breakfast must be a healthy one. Should the University reinstate hot breakfast, it should prioritize healthful options. Expanding the variety of meal choices is wonderful, but these choices should support healthy lifestyles.
In the past, the University has failed to promote healthy choices for students. When funds were cut from hot breakfast in 2009, the then-Executive Director of HUDS stated that some of the money would be redirected towards improving Brain Break. However, we have found Brain Break options to be often disappointing. The University should learn from these past mistakes and emphasize health in any meal enhancement program — hot breakfast, Brain Break, or otherwise.
Now is the time for the University to bring back hot breakfast. Providing hot breakfast in one House per neighborhood is a reasonable solution to concerns of food waste or unnecessary expenditure. The University no longer has reasonable cause to deny hot breakfast options for all upperclassman Houses, and therefore should take action to reinstate them in a timely manner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts has a responsibility to maintain safe conditions in its public facilities. Our Department of Public Health issues mandates to protect those housed in public facilities from dangerous living conditions, including exposure to extreme temperatures — of which we’ve seen record-setting highs and lows this year. However, DPH regulations on high temperatures in prisons do not apply in the summer, from June 15 to September 15. As summer heat waves worsen, these regulations need to be extended to cover summer-time extremes.
We’ve all been dreading the extremely hot days and hoping the evenings will provide some respite. This year, Boston had the hottest summer night-time temperatures since record-keeping began in 1936. In our role as earth scientists, we seek to understand trends in the climate and their societal consequences: We find that the 2.5 degree Fahrenheit increase in Boston summer night-time temperatures is consistent with the global pattern of rising night-time temperatures. This trend is alarming, as heat waves prove most deadly for people unable to cool down at night: In the last 30 years, the leading cause of weather-related death in the US has been exposure to heat. We have a moral imperative to draw attention to the inadequacy of the temperature guidelines set by the DPH, for they become more dangerous as temperatures rise.
Although nursing homes that house the elderly are mandated by the DPH to keep safe temperatures year-round, such guidelines are non-existent for the 9,000 individuals incarcerated during the increasingly hot summer months. Our incarcerated population is diverse in their ages and their reasons for incarceration. Many are held as they await trial for immigration-related offenses, or cannot afford the paltry bail that would free them, or are minors or elderly.
While there is no year-round regulation on acceptable temperature for people incarcerated in Massachusetts, the 1966 Animal Welfare Act requires that housing facilities for monkeys not exceed 85 degrees for more than four consecutive hours. An ongoing lawsuit alleges that the Cedar Junction prison in Norfolk allowed cell temperatures to reach 120 degrees without ventilation this summer, with prisoners fainting and suffering heat strokes. This is appalling. If the allegations hold true, even monkeys destined for research are afforded better rights than our fellow human beings.
It is common sense that prisons must be required to maintain safe temperatures in summer as well as in winter. As we have seen in the overheating deaths of Michael Jefferson in Illinois and Lester Irby in Washington, D.C., we cannot rely on the goodwill of prisons to keep prisoners safe. In 1999, then-New Jersey Governor Whitman vetoed an air-conditioning expenditure, stating “Air conditioning for inmates is not considered a priority,” days before Atari wa’Haki and Vital Prince died of exposure to heat in a Trenton prison. In Texas, a 2011 heat wave killed at least 10 prisoners and culminated in a prolonged and costly legal fight over access to air-conditioning. Still today, 75 percent of Texas prisons remain without air-conditioning.
The DPH and Department of Correction can save time and taxpayer money by adopting humane standards now, instead of waiting to fight lengthy lawsuits as the Texas Department of Criminal Justice has. The people of Massachusetts should tell the DPH to do its job and apply consistent and humane temperature regulations to all of the vulnerable populations housed across our public facilities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
April 17, 2016. I’m a prefrosh at Visitas, still unsure about where I’ll be in the coming fall. And while that decision has occupied most of my thoughts since I received my acceptance letter, at this particular moment I am much more concerned about where I’ll be in the next hour.
I spent the morning going through the Visitas calendar, highlighting the events I want to attend. Yet (perhaps ironically) the event that I’m most excited about remains unmarked. This is intentional; I’m terrified that one of my future classmates or potential friends will ask to borrow my calendar and notice that I’ve highlighted the BGLTQ Meet and Greet. What would they think? What if they told everyone? What if word got back to my parents?
I’m with a group of about six students, and we’ve been going to the same events together all day. But the BGLTQ event starts in 10 minutes, and I’m racking my brain for an excuse to slip away. I consider skipping the event altogether, just to avoid the messiness of lying to my new friends. What if they can tell? What if they already know? What if they secretly hate me for it but are too nice to say anything? Thankfully, the lure of finally meeting other queer people overpowers my fear, and I mumble a hopefully believable excuse before running off.
The event is in Boylston Hall, but I do a few laps around the Yard just in case any of my new friends are still around. I even make a stop in the secluded bathroom of Sever Hall to give myself a pep talk. Before finally walking through the doors of Boylston, I look around to see if anyone I know is watching me. I’m on edge as I make my way to the basement, certain that everyone in the building can see me and knows why I’m here.
But once I reach the event, I’m safe. This is it. The room is packed with students. Someone offers me a rainbow pin and I grab multiple, almost as if I’m worried that I won’t have any more opportunities after this to express my queerness. I meet current undergraduates and am awestruck by how comfortable they are with themselves. How are they so open? I could never be like that.
On my way out, I stuff the rainbow pins into the bottom of my backpack and pray that no one finds them.
April 21, 2018. I’m a sophomore now. I’m also an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the same office which organized the BGLTQ Meet and Greet I attended during Visitas. This year, the Meet and Greet includes a panel of current undergraduates who will answer questions about queer life at Harvard. I’ll be speaking on the panel.
Twenty minutes before the event, I’m at dinner with my friends. When they ask me my plans for the evening, I tell them without hesitation. After dinner, I walk confidently into Grays Hall basement, where the event is being held, without stopping once to see who’s watching. After all, I work here and enter this space multiple times a week.
As prefrosh trickle in, some look unphased, as if they’ve done this dozens of times before. Others seem nervous; it’s probably their first time in a queer space. Some talk loudly with the friends they came with, while others stand alone off to the side. The wide range of comfort levels in the packed room is palpable.
After the panel, some prefrosh approach me with more questions, and some even ask for my contact information in case they think of more questions later.
Near the door sits a bowl of rainbow pins, some of which I made, for the prefrosh to take. As the last attendee leaves and I prepare to close up the space for the night, I glance over at the pins. Their novelty has worn off; by now I’ve made dozens of pins and handed out dozens more. I have one pin proudly decorating my backpack and a couple more scattered around my dorm room. Do I really need another one?
I remember the terrified prefrosh from two years ago, the one so deep in the closet that she had to lie and sneak around to attend the Meet and Greet, the one who hid in a bathroom to give herself a pep talk before entering a queer space, the one who almost didn’t show up due to fear of being outed.
I take a rainbow pin for her.
September 8, 2018. I’m sitting down to write this piece.
I consider it a privilege for me to have reached this point in my life, where I feel comfortable being some level of out in almost every space. Because of my positioning at an elite, fairly liberal institution, I have the autonomy to avoid most of the spaces where I don’t feel comfortable and the resources to seek and create spaces where I do feel comfortable. And while it has and continues to be a difficult journey, I overall feel supported and open.
I find myself forgetting sometimes what it’s like to not be out on campus. I feel a pang of annoyance when someone assumes I’m straight, but less than three years ago, I felt like my life depended on that assumption.
Explicitly queer spaces are wonderful and necessary because they can signal to BGLTQ folks that we’ll be welcome there, and can be catalysts for building community. But labelling a space as queer can present a barrier to entry for those who aren’t out. And even adding “Allies welcome!” may not be enough to make closeted folks feel safe.
I wonder how many BGLTQ prefrosh didn’t show up to the Meet and Greet. I wonder how many walked up to the door of Grays and couldn’t bring themselves to walk in. I wonder how many did show up after sneaking away from their friend groups.
In an ideal world, every BGLTQ-identifying person would feel comfortable being out, in whatever way makes sense to them, in every context. But we’re not quite there yet. And while the most visible members of our community might be out and proud, I want to reaffirm that any BGLTQ-identifying person who isn’t out, whatever “out” means to them, is indeed valid. Coming out is a personal choice, and it’s never required.
For those of us who are out on campus and freely access and create queer spaces, I hope we continue the important work of visibility while remembering and advocating for those in our community who are unable to join us.
For those of us who are not out in all or certain spaces on campus, know that your community is fighting to make this world a more welcoming place, and we’re here to support you regardless of your level of outness.
Whether you have multiple rainbow pins decorating your clothes and bags, one stuffed away in the bottom of your backpack, or have never seen a rainbow pin in your life, you are a valid and important member of our community.
Welcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Fox Club seems unable to decide whether it wants to accept women or not.
The historically all-male, 120-year-old social group — which earlier this month vowed to go co-ed and in return earned College recognition — is no longer planning to do so, according to administrators. Harvard on Tuesday removed the club from a list of recognized social groups it maintains on its website.
The about-face means the Fox likely no longer intends to admit people of all genders — and that the club is once again subject to the College’s sanctions. Recognized social groups must either adopt gender-neutral membership practices or commit to going gender-neutral at some point down the road. In exchange, they receive freedom from Harvard’s social group penalties as well as perks including access to University spaces — and, if they’re especially well-behaved, wads of College cash.
Harvard’s sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, serving as captains of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
The Fox’s U-turn this week marks the second time the group has flirted with going gender-neutral. In 2015, undergraduate members of the club voted to accept nine junior and senior women, prompting displeasure from its graduate board — and at one point spurring the alumni body to shut down the Fox’s clubhouse on JFK St.
But it didn’t last. In July 2017, the Fox’s graduate board permanently revoked membership for the nine women. In total, the women continued as members of the Fox for roughly a year and a half.
This time around, the Fox’s co-ed intentions were even shorter-lived — made public for only 11 days.
Hugh M. Nesbit ’77, the club’s graduate president, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday about the club’s membership policies. Several undergraduate members of the club also did not respond to requests for comment.
Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman did not specify when the Fox notified the College that it no longer plans to pursue recognition, but he wrote in an email that the change officially took effect Tuesday.
“You can say it is effective today,” Goldman wrote in an email.
The Fox was originally one of 15 social groups — including formerly all-male final clubs the Delphic and the Spee — that promised to renounce their single-gender status in exchange for College recognition and freedom from the sanctions over the summer. Administrators finalized and published the list of 15 on Sept. 7.
That round of recognition left Harvard without women-only social groups.
The Fox’s reversal may mean its graduate board can breathe a sigh of relief. Harvard appears to be targeting recognized social groups’ traditional governance structures — administrators have said they will revoke recognition for groups whose alumni boards exert undue influence over undergraduate members.
As part of its brief bid for recognition, the Fox received an “action plan” from College administrators outlining recommended next steps meant to help the group achieve greater gender inclusion, Miller said earlier this month.
Goldman declined to comment on contents of the “action plan” given to the Fox.
In renouncing Harvard recognition, the Fox edges closer to the handful of social groups that continue to defy the College’s sanctions. Three fraternities and three all-male final clubs — the A.D., the Porcellian, and the Fly Club — have taken the fight to Capitol Hill, where they are lobbying Congress in a bid to cancel the penalties.

The Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 moved into a clubhouse at 45 Dunster St. that formerly housed the Bee Club on Sept. 5, according to a post on the Pudding’s Facebook page.
The group — an umbrella organization that includes the Hasty Pudding Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and the Harvard Krokodiloes — is leasing its new space from the Fly Club, according to Cambridge property records.
This is not the first time the Pudding has eyed 45 Dunster St. — a property that the City of Cambridge assesses at $4,456,000 — as a prospective clubhouse. In 2010, the Pudding bid for the property along with the Chabad House at Harvard before both lost to the Bee.
The Bee vacated the Dunster St. clubhouse and moved into the Delphic Club’s space at 9 Linden St. in fall 2017 after the two social groups decided to share membership and property. Since the move, the College has designated the Delphic-Bee as a recognized social organization, meaning the clubs are exempt from Harvard’s social group sanctions.
The College’s sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captancies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
The Pudding has used 96 Winthrop St. — known as the Hyde-Taylor House and valued by the City of Cambridge at $3,943,000 — as its social home since 2014. Then-Cambridge mayor David P. Maher and then-Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith attended a ribbon-cutting event when the Pudding first moved into the space.
Chairman of the Hasty Pudding Institute Andrew L. Farkas ’82 did not respond to a request for comment. Raj K. Dhanda — who owns the house at 96 Winthrop St. — did not respond to questions about whether a new tenant has yet leased the building.

Tickets to the Harvard-Yale Football game on Nov. 17 will be free for undergraduate students but will come with assigned seats, according to an email sent to students from Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair on Tuesday.
Tickets for Harvard students have historically been free when the annual football game is hosted at the University’s stadium. In a departure from tradition, this year’s Game, the 135th matchup between the two teams, will be played at Fenway Park.
Students can pick up one free ticket per HUID, as in past years. However, each student will have to sit in the seats assigned on his or her ticket, a policy that O’Dair wrote is a requirement of Fenway Park.
“Fenway Park will be enforcing seating assignments within the designated student sections, so if you are interested in sitting next to one another, you must claim your ticket at the same time as others you wish to sit next to,” O’Dair wrote.
While in past years, students were able to purchase tickets for guests from the Athletics Box Office, this year students are strictly limited to one ticket per HUID, according to the email, which O'Dair sent on behalf of the Athletics Department.
Ticket distribution will also take place earlier this year than in the past. Students can pick up their tickets at the Smith Campus Center on Oct. 11 or 12, or at the Murr Center between Oct. 1 and 18. In 2017, tickets could be picked up until two days before the Game.
Out of 23 students who shared their opinions with The Crimson, 17 said they were dissatisfied with the changes to the seating arrangements or the guest policy.
“It’s going to be difficult to get tickets next to friends because we can’t schedule a time to pick them up together,” Marissa A. Rodriguez ’19 said.
Many of the students also said they think it will be difficult to enforce assigned seats, since students move around during the Game.
“The thing is that something like assigned seating isn’t going to be effective. Everyone’s going to switch it around,” Joyce M. Fung ’20 said. “My experience with Harvard-Yale is it’s the pregame, and it’s the aftergame, and it’s the pre-pregame. With the Game itself, you’re there for the spirit and not really for the Game.”
Students said the inability to purchase guest tickets has changed their tentative plans for the Game. Last year, students could purchase guest tickets for between $55 and $75.  Without a guest ticket program for students this year, those interested in bringing guests would have needed to purchase them through the Athletics Box Office.
But general admissions tickets for this year's Game — which ranged in price from $25 to $125 — went on sale April 27 and have since sold out. Some resold tickets on the ticket site StubHub are listed for more than $300. In her email, O’Dair wrote that students may not resell their tickets to either other students or members of the public.
“I just find it frustrating that they suddenly ended the guest policy without really telling anyone because I was planning on taking my sister to the Game with me,” Maria L. Burzillo ’20 said. “Now they’re completely sold out online already and [reselling] online for $300, which is just totally infeasible.”
While several students said they were unaware of, or didn’t have strong opinions about, the new policies, Kendall N. Laws ’21 said the logistical changes and potential complications may deter her from going to the Game at all.
“That’s kind of an incentive not to go to the Game, honestly,” she said. “I’m already kind of on the fence about it.”
O’Dair’s email also informed students that the University will provide free transportation for students between Harvard and Fenway Park. The Athletics Department’s website says Harvard will be hosting a FanZone near Fenway, open to the public for free, where guests can purchase food and beverages.
The email did not go into specifics about where student tailgates, typically held outside of Harvard Stadium, will take place. In an interview last fall, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said the Athletics Department hopes to hold tailgates near Fenway Park to increase attendance at the Game.
“We are very excited to face our historic rivals at Fenway Park, a landmark for New England sports,” Scalise said in a November press release when the game’s location was first announced. “This will be a special experience for our student-athletes, student body, alumni, and fans.”
Correction: Sept. 19, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that The Game will be played on Oct. 17. In fact, it will be played on Nov. 17.

Harvard Law School celebrated its bicentennial last year, but women were not fully included in that history for more than a century.
The first class of women graduated from the school in 1953 — and 65 years later, Law School alumnae, students, and professors gathered last Friday and Saturday to celebrate the anniversary.
Dubbed "Celebration 65," the two-day program featured a variety of workshops, panels, and speeches from high-profile alumnae such as former U.S. Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch ’81 and the first woman president of Ireland, Mary T.W. Robinson. Three women from the pioneering class of Law School alumnae attended the celebratory events.
Program events touched on topics of relevance to alumnae in both legal and non-legal fields,  such as public interest, corporate law, local government, and the #MeToo movement.
Elizabeth Papp Kamali ’97, an assistant professor at the Law School, wrote in an email that she  was “heartened” to see many of her former classmates and commented on the great advances women have made in the past 65 years.
“While 1953 seems like shockingly recent history, one recurring theme throughout the celebration was the incredible strides women have made within the law in the last half century,” Kamali wrote.
Elizabeth H. “Betsy” Munnell ‘73, an alumna who now works as a business development coach and legal consultant, said the event left her optimistic the ways in which fellow alumnae are changing the legal field.
“I’ve been going to this for quite some time — the very first one, the 25th, occurred when I was in law school and it was organized by friends of mine,” Munnell said. “I go for the sense of optimism that you can leave with because you’ve been listening to people who are really trying to make changes in the world on behalf of women and minorities in the practice of law.”
While hundreds of alumnae returned to the event, student turnout was lower. The event cost $50 for students, and event organizer and Law School alumna Anne C. Weisberg said the timing of the event and confusion over which events students had to pay for may have led to low student involvement. Weisberg she hopes to engage with current students more in future celebrations.
“I think we are going to look and discuss with the larger HLSA, the alumni association, Harvard Law School Association, whether there's a way...not to have to charge students at all,” she said. “One person I talked to suggested that we put in the registration the option of sponsoring a student.”
Rebecca F. Prager, a third-year Law student, said she wished that more students had been a part of this “amazing experience.”
“I had no idea that there were so many accomplished women coming out of Harvard Law School and it was a really great opportunity to meet those women and network with them, and I wish that there had been more students there because I think it was such an amazing opportunity and I think that so many students just did not know about it,” Prager said.
Prager also said she believes the attendance cost played a factor in the low student turnout.
“I think the cost of attending for students was a bit prohibitively expensive so I think that stopped a lot of people from attending as well,” she said.
Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells wrote in a statement that “students were involved in every step of the process” and “forg[ed] connections” with many of the alumnae.
“We were very pleased with the student turnout and excitement for Celebration 65,” Sells wrote. “Building these connections made this more than just an inspiring weekend – its greatest impact will be in the networks and friendships that flourish in the years to come.”
Dean of the Law School John F. Manning ’82 also commented via a spokesperson on Celebration 65, calling it “inspiring.”
“Exceptionally accomplished alumnae across many fields and many generations gathered with HLS students, faculty, and staff to learn together, to address hard problems, and to find in one another collaborations and inspiration for the work that lies ahead,” Manning wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cabot House Dining Hall flooded during heavy rains Tuesday morning, swapping students for caution tape during lunch and dinner.
Though the dining hall was filled with standing water — which caused food service in the House to be cancelled — by 4:30 p.m., Cabot was already on the mend.
Cabot Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Khurana wrote in an emailed statement, “Our facilities team is working hard to mitigate the water issues from the intense rain this afternoon. We expect to return to normal dining service operations for breakfast tomorrow. We appreciate everyone’s support and flexibility.”
With all doors propped open and fans and dehumidifiers running full blast, workers from ATI Restoration spent much of the day cleaning Cabot’s dining hall to resume normal operations.
“With the amount of rainfall that came down this morning, you had an abundance of water flow through the window sills and through the foundation into the floor,” restoration worker Jeffrey R. Gelinas said.
Gelinas said the workers needed to extract standing water, disinfect the dining hall, install temporary dehumidifiers and air removers to “remove all relative humidity out of all materials in the building affected.”
Gelinas predicted that the dining hall’s full restoration would be complete slightly after Wednesday’s breakfast. He said he anticipated that the space should be back to normal by Thursday or Friday.
Some students said they were caught off guard by the flooding announcement.
“I was super shocked to see how extensive it was,” Lydia Pan ’21 said. “We got an email sent out over the Cabot list with a picture of water just covering the floor.”
Luckily for Cabot residents, Pforzheimer Dining Hall and Currier Dining Hall are only a few paces away. At lunch on Tuesday, Cabot students were redirected to Pforzheimer, and Harvard University Dining Services staff were temporarily reassigned to other Quad dining halls.
James Cababa, a chef at Pforzheimer and Cabot, said that the other two Quad Houses were prepared for the influx of students. He predicted that most students would head to Currier, since its entrance is closer to Cabot.
“We are preparing the high quality food that we do all the time,” he said. “We sent some of our employees over [to Currier] just to help out, just to make sure the students are taken care of.”
Despite the inconveniences of the flooding, multiple Quad students expressed support for Cabot House and satisfaction with how the situation is being handled.
“Luckily, a lot of us already eat lunch at our sister house, Lowell,” Emily J. Rios ’21 said. “I have found that the Quad has a tight knit community and that if I go to another Quad d-hall, I am bound to see someone I know.”
Debolina Ghosh ’21 added that Cabot’s Sophomore Dinner Tuesday evening was unaffected by the dining hall’s inaccessibility.
Basil M. Baccouche ’20 tried to look on the bright side of Cabot’s flooded dining hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Poised to go on strike at any moment, thousands of unionized hotel employees in Boston and across the nation are looking to Harvard dining workers for words of advice.
The Boston employees — hotel staff members represented by UNITE HERE Local 26 — have been locked in contract negotiations with Marriott since March, Local 26 President Brian Lang said. According to Lang, the union and the hotel chain are disagree over wages, retirement benefits, and working conditions. Workers voted on Sept. 12 to authorize a strike if negotiations fall through.
The developments in Boston follow a national-level escalation between UNITE HERE and Marriott that began early last week, after a strike vote by thousands of Marriott employees on Oahu and Maui.  Marriott workers in San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle followed suit soon afterwards, and employees in several cities have upcoming votes scheduled.
UNITE HERE, whose Local 26 chapter also represents Harvard University Dining Services workers, made waves on Harvard’s campus two years ago, when HUDS employees went on strike for 22 days. That fall 2016 strike — the first walkout Harvard had seen since 1983 — was ultimately successful.
Now, as the hotel employees prepare for a potential strike of their own, Local 26 shop chief and Adams House chef Edward B. Childs said leaders of the strike movement have been looking at the 2016 Harvard dining workers’ strike as an example to emulate.
“They’ve been calling us about how we prepared,” Childs said. “We’ve been very integral with what’s been going on — not just in Boston, nationally.”
“The Local has tons of experience, because of our experience at Harvard, in getting coalitions to work, fine tuning our demands, and strategy of how to win a strike,” he added.
After months of deadlocked negotiations, Marriott workers began hosting pop-up pickets around a month ago. Childs said the HUDS union sent a “contingent” of workers to a rally last week, and they plan to continue to attend upcoming rallies, and — if relations between union and employer reach a boiling point — walk the picket line alongside Marriott employees.
“We’ll give them as much support as we can,” Childs said.
Lang said that — for now — the union is still attempting to negotiate with Marriott, and no deadline has been set for when employees will walk out.
However, with the authorization vote passed and union leadership already talking and strategizing, a strike could happen “at any time,” according to Lang.
In an emailed statement, a Marriott spokesperson wrote that the company sees “no reason to believe” they will fail to reach an agreement with the union.
“We respect the right of our associates to voice their opinions on issues that are important to them. Should the union and our employees choose to strike, our hotels will continue to operate and work to minimize any disruption and to provide the excellent service that our guest have come to expect,” the spokesperson wrote.
Childs said he believes the Marriott strike may not have been authorized if the hotel employees had not witnessed and participated in the 2016 HUDS strike.
“Would they have gone out without the Harvard workers going out? A lot of them would be more hesitant,” Childs said. “A lot of them say that, ‘Okay, it’s going to be very tough, it’s going to be tough on our families, but I think we can explain it because Harvard workers did it.’
“Busloads of hotel workers came and supported us all the time during the three weeks, with our rallies, our pickets; they came by the busloads to help us out, and that won’t be forgotten,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s lawyers want evidence of institutional anti-Semitism perpetrated nearly a century ago to be barred from the upcoming trial in a lawsuit that accuses the University of present-day discrimination against Asian Americans in the admissions process.
Students for Fair Admissions, the plaintiff in the ongoing lawsuit, planned to bring at least a dozen exhibits related to past anti-Semitic discrimination at Harvard. Harvard’s lawyers argued in a Monday filing that the exhibits — which date back to the first half of the twentieth century — have “nothing to do with” allegations that the College illegally discriminates against Asian-American applicants in the twenty-first century.
“SFFA’s focus on ancient history is an obvious attempt to distract the Court from the dearth of evidence showing intentional discrimination in this case,” the lawyers wrote. “But SFFA should not be permitted to confuse the issues and waste the Court’s time by presenting evidence that, as this Court has recognized, has nothing to do with its claims.”
Institutional discrimination against Jewish applicants to Harvard took place under the administration of former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, who introduced an early system of “holistic” admissions at the College in the 1920s that took into account non-academic factors.
As part of his admissions reforms, Lowell attempted to institute quotas limiting Jewish admit rates to the College. Lowell’s attempt failed, but Harvard’s new admissions process was still used to restrict the number of Jewish students at the school without the use of hard quotas.
In the intervening decades, the College’s admissions process — while remaining holistic — has undergone numerous changes, most notably under former University President Derek C. Bok, who instituted trailblazing affirmative action policies in the seventies.
SFFA has argued Harvard’s current system of holistic admissions has inherited the discriminatory tendencies of its almost century-old precursor. In the modern day, SFFA has alleged, Harvard’s consideration of race in admissions unfairly limits admission of Asian-American students to the College, as it once did to Jewish students.
Harvard has held that its race-conscious admissions policy is necessary to achieve diversity in the student body, and that the Supreme Court has upheld the legality of similar policies.
Harvard representatives addressed historical discrimination in the University’s admissions process in a “Frequently Asked Questions” document published over the summer.
“These unfortunate events from 100 years ago are a dark chapter in Harvard’s history,” the document reads. “For many years, we have been committed to evaluating the whole person and we consider each applicant’s unique background and experiences, alongside grades and test scores, to find applicants of exceptional ability and character.”
In less than a month, Harvard and SFFA will meet in federal court in an attempt to settle the dispute, with or without SFFA’s evidence of historical discrimination. Over the past several days, the two parties have debated what evidence and which witnesses should be permitted in court.
On Monday, Harvard asked District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs to allow current College students and alumni to testify at the trial, though SFFA’s lawyers argued that such testimony would be irrelevant.
For its part, SFFA asked Burroughs Monday to prohibit Harvard from calling Edward Blum — the president of SFFA — as a witness, arguing that “he has no relevant information to offer at this trial.”
The trial is set to begin on Oct. 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors Emeriti in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are afforded a host of privileges after they retire — and, even when facing allegations of sexual misconduct, they apparently get to keep them.
Pending the results of an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment of close to two dozen women, Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez will continue to receive the perks that come with his emeritus status, including access to University spaces and research support.
Dominguez announced his retirement last semester, less than a week after The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that at least 20 women were accusing him of sexual misconduct over a period spanning nearly 40 years. Two days before Dominguez made his announcement, former Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith emailed FAS affiliates to declare that Dominguez would be put on paid “administrative leave” while FAS investigated the allegations.
The Office for Dispute Resolution launched an investigation into Dominguez in the spring based on a Title IX complaint filed by FAS. Title IX is the anti-sex discrimination law that underpins Harvard’s approach to sexual assault. Individuals can file their own Title IX complaints, or, as in this case, FAS may file on behalf of complainants.
Though Dominguez remains under investigation, his retirement began on June 30 and he now holds emeritus status, which is automatically conferred upon eligible retired faculty.
FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven confirmed Tuesday that Dominguez currently benefits from all of the privileges afforded to Professors Emeriti, pending the results of the investigation.
According to the Faculty Retirement Handbook, Professors Emeriti can teach up to one four-credit course per year after their retirement. They can also offer departmental courses with the invitation of the department chair and approval of the Divisional Dean. Additionally, they can offer freshman seminars, pending approval from the Committee on Freshman Seminars.
Dominguez taught a freshman seminar the semester before the allegations came to light.
Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild wrote in an email Tuesday that Dominguez has not contacted the department about teaching a course.
“Professor Dominguez has not contacted me about teaching a Government class this year,” she wrote. “So far as I know, he has not contacted the undergraduate or graduate offices in Gov either.”
Other privileges provided to faculty holding emeritus status include the ability to continue graduate advising, access to libraries and online resources, use of FAS emails, office space within departmental guidelines, research space and resources, and medical and dental benefits.
It is unclear when the investigation into allegations against Dominguez will conclude.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes people wonder why no one trusts polling data. But then the Ivy League releases a preseason poll with Yale at the top. And then Yale loses the first game. The suspicion is either a result of that or the 2016 election. Your guess is as good as mine.
The loss, Yale’s not Hillary Clinton's, while good for my loyalties to my collegiate institution, are bad for any person predicting scores for Ivy League games — so me, last week. The Bulldogs’ falter reminds all of us with an eye on the conference that the Ancient Eight remains as tumultuous as ever.
Like spokes on a wheel, the division’s top teams continuously exchange championship rings from year to year. The proclivity of the division to uphold ties by recognizing every squad with the best record as the “champion” exasperates this flip-flop of Ivy League champions.
In the last three seasons, five of the division’s eight institutions have been able to lay at least partial claim to the title “Ivy League Champion.” Penn is the only team do have done so twice during this time frame, while in 2015, the Quakers, Harvard and Dartmouth shared the title. Penn and Yale both won outright titles in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
That means the only three teams in the division to not have finished a season at the top are Cornell, Columbia and Brown. Cornell, a team that was eyed toward the beginning of the 2017 season as a potential champion, won three of its first four divisional matches, dropping only a contest to Yale but besting Princeton, Harvard and Brown — which is no small feat for an Ivy League team. The subsequent three games told an opposite tale: losses to Columbia, Dartmouth and Penn.
Columbia did even better. The Lions went a perfect 6-0 through the first six — and three divisional — games of the season. Yale ended this streak in week seven, and Harvard landed the second punch that dropped the Lions into second place for the 2017 season.
Up until the last two weeks of the 2017 schedule, nearly every team but Brown still had a chance to win the division. Looking game to game drew even less distinction between the teams. Yale won the Ancient Eight but lost to Dartmouth. Dartmouth lost to Harvard. Harvard lost to Princeton. Princeton lost to Dartmouth. Dartmouth lost also to Columbia, which also lost to Harvard, which also lost to Cornell, which beat Princeton but lost to Penn. The only team immune from the mess was Brown, which lost to everybody.
The point of this entire macro evaluation of 2017 is to prove that nearly every team in the Ivy League has a shot at the crown, every year.
This year was thought to have maybe changed that cycle. Yale won its first outright title since 1980 and returned a majority of their mainstay pieces. Junior quarterback Kurt Rawlins passed 2320 yards in the 2017 season and is back with another year of experience. He’ll have a familiar set of hands to throw to with junior JP Shohfi returning to the team as well. Not to mention sophomore running back Zane Dudek.
All in all, Yale is supposed to be scary on offense. All of these pre-season inclinations were shattered by the Bulldogs’ loss last week to Holy Cross. Not just Holy Cross, 0-2 Holy Cross. The Crusaders went into the contest without a win and Yale left still not having one. The only other Ivy League teams to suffer a defeat in opening week were Cornell and Brown, to Delaware and Cal Poly, respectively. The three teams have subsequently fallen to sixth place in the division.
In the two weeks prior, Holy Cross suffered defeats at the hands of Boston College and Colgate. The former of which is a legitimate ACC team, the latter 2-1, having bested New Hampshire by only seven this past weekend. It’s also worth noting that none of this really matters. Ivy League rankings are based on Ivy League games only.
But questions remain: is Holy Cross a good team? Is Yale a bad team? Was the inaugural weekend’s loss a fluke or indicative of an overhyped Bulldog squad? All questions we can’t really answer this early in the season.
Welcome to Ivy League football.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three goals by Sicher. Two shutouts by the Crimson. Number one in the league.
Not only did Harvard cruise through this weekend’s matches as it faced two Massachusetts rivals, but sophomore forward Natalie Sicher’s breakout game on Sunday earned her the title of Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week.
Neither the Northeastern Huskies nor the Massachusetts Minutewomen were able to take down Harvard (4-1), as the home team’s stout defense smoothly shut out both squads. Sicher’s hat trick against UMass (3-5) rounded out the team’s weekend, handing Harvard the win in Sunday’s game. Two days prior, a pair of scores from two of the group’s key upperclassmen propelled the Crimson to victory.
Though Harvard has yet to play an opponent from the Ancient Eight, a Sept. 18 poll by the National Field Hockey Coaches Association ranked the Crimson 20th in Division-I field hockey, second in the Ivy League to only fifth-ranked Princeton.
HARVARD 4, MASSACHUSETTS 0
In the 63rd minute, sophomore Tessel Huibregsten weaved between multiple defending Minutewomen before firing a shot toward the cage. Sicher was there to put in the rebound and secure her hat trick.
Harvard’s offensive outburst against UMass was largely due to Sicher’s lethal performance. She logged the first goal trio of her career and just the second for the Crimson this season.
In its own half of the field, Harvard performed just as well as it did on the offensive. Freshman goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo earned her first career win and shutout, albeit with little action in the cage. The Crimson defense’s lockdown performance limited the Minutewomen to a single attempted shot.
The home squad tacked on another score in the contest’s dwindling minutes: freshman Kiley Allen’s shot from the top of the circle found twine for the first of her career. Allen finished the day with three points, as the late-game goal supplemented her first-half assist on a Sicher snipe.
Harvard faced another opponent during Sunday’s match at Berylson Field: the temperature, which climbed to levels above 80 degrees that afternoon.
A brief second-half hydration break for both teams allowed the Crimson to conquer the oppressive heat. As for the main foe on Sunday, the Harvard proved the danger in discounting both its offense and defense.
Sunday’s game snapped the Crimson’s seven-game losing streak to UMass-Amherst as Harvard registered its first win against the Minutewomen since 2005.
HARVARD 2, NORTHEASTERN 0
The Huskies (2-4) had history on their side as they made the trip across the Charles on Friday, not having fallen to the Crimson at Berylson since 2008. The past gave no indication, however, as to how this game would be played. Harvard outscored Northeastern by a pair to pocket its first shutout of the weekend.
The Crimson’s points were split between senior captain Kathleen Young and junior midfielder Bente van Vlijmen. The latter scored toward the middle of the first half, putting away her own rebound. Young added to the scoreboard with a second-half goal that she redirected off a shot by Allen.
Though the Huskies outnumbered Harvard in saves, registering nine to Harvard’s two, Northeastern remained scoreless throughout the match. Crimson goalkeeper Libby Manela registered her eighth career shutout, saving a deflected shot from up the field to hold Harvard’s lead.
After Friday’s game, the Crimson improved its home record to 14-4 since the start of 2016, with van Vlijmen leading the Ivy League in goals for the season. Harvard’s hot streak at home will be tested this weekend as the Yale Bulldogs come to Berylson to face the Crimson.
