After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LAWRENCE, Kan.—In the land of the yellow brick road, the Harvard men’s basketball team (2-6) nearly wrote its own fairy tale Saturday afternoon.
Down 16 to No. 4 Kansas (6-1) after just 13 minutes, the Crimson used lockdown defense and efficient offense to outscore the Jayhawks 40-24 over the next 20 minutes of action. Harvard had just four turnovers in the second half, scoring on eight of 11 possessions at one point to tie the game with 7:35 left on two free throws by freshman Weisner Perez. Kansas would outscore the Crimson 19-13 the rest of the way, however, for the 75-69 victory.
“I was disappointed, as was our ballclub was, in the final result but I was pleased with the effort and how hard we competed against an outstanding team,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
The final eight minutes were a script the Crimson has grown accustomed to seeing.
Like in NCAA Tournament games against Michigan State and North Carolina, a late Harvard push was immediately rebuffed by the opposing national heavyweight. At Allen Fieldhouse, it was the Jayhawk upperclassmen putting the game out of arm’s reach.
First came a three-point play by enigmatic senior Kansas forward Perry Ellis. After freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy airballed a step-back jumper, Ellis drained another jumper to put his team up five.
The Crimson bounced off the mat quickly, cutting the lead to three on two free throws from freshman Weisner Perez. From there, junior Kansas point guard Frank Mason III put the game away.
As the Crimson fell back in zone, Mason found backcourt running mate Devonte’ Graham for an open trey to extend the lead to six. Two possessions later, with the shot clock running down, Mason, who led all scorers with 21, did the deed himself—draining a three in McCarthy’s face and sending Allen Fieldhouse into a frenzy.
Harvard would pull within three on a Perez layup with 28 seconds remaining, but turned the ball over for the 19th time on the next possession. McCarthy fouled out while intentionally sending Mason to the line, and the Kansas junior iced the game with consecutive free throws.
“It is a historic arena and [playing here] is the kind of thing you dream about since you are a little kid…” McCarthy said. “Wish we could have got the win but it is still a great experience.”
The game began on even terms, with Perez draining two free throws with 11:52 left in the half to cut the early Jayhawk lead to two.
The ensuing 76 seconds were exactly what most analysts presaged for the entire game. After Svi Mykhailiuk drained a three from the corner, the Jayhawks twice forced the Crimson into poor shots and got quick points on the other end. The second poor Harvard attempt, a fallaway by Agunwa Okolie, turned into an easy layup when a streaking Graham went coast-to-coast in just five seconds.
Amaker quickly called timeout, but a three-point lead had become 11. Over the ensuing four minutes, Harvard scored just two points as Kansas pushed the margin to 16.
With the capacity crowd of 16,300 roaring, however, Harvard clamped down. In the last seven minutes of the first half, the Crimson outscored the home team 13-6.
“I don’t really think we were playing attention to the score, we were just playing and trying to compete and controlling what we could control,” junior Zena Edosomwan said. “Obviously we were trying to get stops and when that kind of happened and guys were more relaxed and ready to go, good things happened.”
The beginning of the second half was more of the same, as a the Crimson kept better care of the ball, preventing the Jayhawks from getting out in transition and neutering their offense. After four quick points in 37 seconds, Kansas scored just 14 points in the next 12 minutes.
On the offensive end, Harvard attacked the paint relentlessly with an undersized lineup. Playing Perez at the four for the majority of the second half, Harvard had 18 points in the paint and five offensive rebounds.
After the game, Amaker said that Perez, who led the team with 15 points, embodied the toughness and composure he hoped the team could take away from the loss.
“I was very encouraged with the progress of our freshman players,” Amaker said. “We have come a long way in that department for those kids in particular and there are a lot of things we think we can use going forward. Composure should be one of those.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LAWRENCE, Kan.–The Harvard men’s basketball team (2-6) saved its best performance of the young season for Saturday’s road clash with perennial heavyweight No. 4/6 Kansas (6-1). The Crimson ultimately fell, 75-69, but breakout performances from freshmen Weisner Perez and Tommy McCarthy allowed Harvard to push the Jayhawks to the brink in the team’s first matchup with a ranked opponent since last season’s two-point NCAA tournament loss to North Carolina.
TAKING CARE OF THE BALL
The Crimson’s ball control was the key to the team’s second half surge in which it outscored Kansas, 40-37. After committing 15 turnovers in the first half, Harvard turned the ball over just four times after intermission. McCarthy had just one turnover in his 20 minutes of second half action. Entering Saturday, the team was averaging 15 turnovers a contest.
“Taking care of the ball is one key for us, being on the road and being here against their pressure,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We can run solid offense and have positive possessions, not turn it over in the open floor and let them get out and get the crowd riled up and get this place rocking and rolling.”
In the first half, the Crimson appeared anxious offensively, with many passes being bobbled inside by or intercepted by the Jayhawks’ long backcourt defenders. Kansas had 12 points off turnovers and 13 fast break points in the first half. Harvard’s starting five alone combined for 10 turnovers in the first 20 minutes. The 15 total turnovers were the most the team has had in a half all season.
“I think a big thing for us, we just want to come together and make ways to tighten up our game in the second half,” junior forward Zena Edosomwan said. “Once you get out there making better decisions, I think getting all the nerves out, guys were more relaxed and ready to play.”
The second half was a different story. The Jayhawks lost their best perimeter defender in Wayne Selden, Jr., as the junior was battling foul trouble. As Edosomwan began attracting double teams down low, The Crimson’s guards were able to capitalize on greater floor spacing to take an open shot or find a teammate in the paint.
Harvard was able to attempt seven more field goals than it did in the first half and went to the line 11 times in the game’s final 20 minutes. The team’s ball control allowed the Crimson to hold Kansas to just two fast break points in the second half. The four turnovers were the fewest the team has had in a half this season.
QUITE THE ENCORE
Chicago is known for producing players who shine when the spotlight is brightest. Four years after Anthony Davis broke the Jayhawks’ heart in the National Championship and eight years after Derrick Rose nearly did the same, Perez did everything he could to make Harvard the first Ivy League team to hand Kansas a loss.
“Weisner is a tough kid,” Amaker said. “He’s from a tough part of Chicago and he’s a scrapper, and so he’s a kid that I’m not surprised about how he has been able to give us that kind of lift in certain areas.”
After posting career highs in points on Wednesday night against Northeastern, Perez unleashed his strongest game of the season. He led the Crimson with 15 points in just 20 minutes.
After seeing eight minutes of action in the first half, Perez was a fixture in the Harvard lineup down the stretch, adding 11 points and five rebounds after intermission. The freshman provided a change of pace for the Crimson on the offensive end and on the glass despite being undersized against the Jayhawk frontline.
“Weisner is a great spark for us,” McCarthy said. “He plays his rear end off every time he gets the opportunity and he has been a huge spark for us off the bench.”
Perez’s scoring touch Saturday also came at key moments. He cut the Kansas lead to one on two separate occasions and sank two free throws with 7:35 left to tie the game at 56.

In the past few weeks, Facebook users around the country have found themselves invited to dozens of weird events. Their popularity is clearly growing as approximately 4,000 people have already said they are going (not really of course)  to “lying in bed and cryin to Adele and feeling bad 4 urself” on December 31st. I was already invited to “turn into the mitochondria and become the powerhouse of the cell” earlier this week. The trend has only gained  strength as we head into reading period and finals. To aid in your procrastination efforts, here are some Harvard Facebook events that Harvard students could attend.
1) Through the Gates sponsors Swai fishing with HUDS by the Charles RiverFor those missing this treasured menu item come this Saturday to Weeks Footbridge with your fishing pole, bucket hat and boat shoes for an afternoon of fun swai fishing with your favorite HUDS employees. Take pride in the fact that your fish will be the “catch of the day” tomorrow for lunch. We will meet at 2:00 p.m. and go until sundown. At least we know it is local, right?
2) Perch yourself in a tree in Harvard Yard to hunt squirrelsJoin your fellow Harvard Hunters this Tuesday for an evening on the prowl. Instead of going after the fame-obsessed avian, go back to Harvard’s first love. This week’s goal is to take the most Instagram photos of squirrels in one hour. Bring your friends and a parka– it gets cold at night. We are positive the squirrels haven’t started hibernating yet, right?
3) Eat a whole tray of HUDS Apple Crisp by yourself in one sittingDefinitely not for the light of heart, but definitely for the empty of stomach. Prepare to be hated by everyone in the dining hall for eating the best dessert of the fall semester. At 235 calories per serving, you should be all set for your winter body this J-term. Unhealthy? Yes. But at least it’s not like it’s a blondie brownie.
4) Go around Boston by riding the T dressed as John Harvard and wait for people to rub your footBonus points if you remain frozen the entire time. With all the tourists around the city it shouldn’t take long. And at least you are finally heading outside of the Harvard bubble. Beware of a tinkle near your shoe.
There is no better way to feel like you’re truly a part of Harvard by losing your self-esteem at a networking event. Put on that business casual outfit you’ve worn five times before and print the resume you just created for an afternoon of clammy handshakes. We will meet at the John Harvard Statue at 4:00 p.m. on December 13th. We will leave at 4:10 p.m. after realizing we used the wrong font.
