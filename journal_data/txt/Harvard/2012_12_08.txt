After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sarah A. Moon '15 and Sammy G. Young '15 have big plans for drawing students into the arts—one of which involves structures built out of marshmallows. Moon and Young have organized the first Quad Arts Festival, to be held this afternoon in the SOCH. A space on the first floor of the building will be arranged into a collection of stations where volunteers will host a range of hands-on artistic activities. Moon and Young hope the event will encourage students to engage with the arts regardless of previous experience.
At the festival, each station will function like a brief workshop in a certain craft. At one station, Leandro Couto de Almeida, a tutor in Cabot, will teach clay-making with hand tools; at another, Emily C. Lowe '14 and Francesca S. Del Frate '15 will lead friendship bracelet-making. Jordan T. Colman '15, Monica M. Palos '15, and Ege Yumusak '16 will coordinate the drawing and painting station, where participants will work together to create a large mural. "We'll have a Jackson Pollock-like painting activity where everyone does their own little piece, and then put it all together and make one big piece," Young says. Students will be able to take home pieces they create at these stations.
Apart from the stations, the festival will also feature live piano music and an engineering design contest. Competitors, working individually or in teams, will be given a certain amount of time to build a structure of marshmallows and other materials; the winner will receive a prize.
In addition to orchestrating this festival, they have made plans to open a roughly 600-square-foot arts space at Cabot House next semester. Moon says they intend the space for the benefit of students who want to include art in their lives without necessarily having the larger commitment of a club or class. "That's the whole idea behind the collaborative aspect and the space and the event itself," Moon says. "We're trying to get the widest range of people possible."
Moon and Young, both Cabot House residents, have been working to open the arts space since they were freshmen. "Sarah Moon and Sammy Young came to us just after housing day and expressed their interest in starting an arts-type studio here at Cabot," Cabot House Master Stephanie R. Khurana says. The studio, Moon and Young say, will include areas for sculpting, pottery, painting, and drawing, in addition to other workspaces.
Moon and Young emphasize that the event caters to newcomers as well as practiced artists. "[We welcome] people with a general interest in art: either some experience in high school or like, random experience, or [who] just have never tried before. We want to bring them together and make them welcome and not intimidated," Moon says.
The festival will be run entirely by volunteering individuals and not clubs. Instead of soliciting participation from established artistic organizations on campus, Moon and Young have sought to bring together both individuals who are formally affiliated with the arts at Harvard and those who are not. "These artists that we’re trying to get aren't VES concentrators and aren't, like, part of the ballet association," Moon says. "Basically, this whole event is trying to access people who aren't already involved in art as well as bring other people who are involved in art together."
At the end of the day, some may go to the festival simply in quest of a short, de-stressing session in the middle of finals preparation. "In making it accessible to everyone, especially that it's during Reading Period, it will be a really good study break—to have tactile engagement in the midst of everything you are working on in your head during finals period," Moon says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
STORRS, Conn.—For the middle 18 minutes of its game at Connecticut Friday night, the Harvard men's basketball team hung tough with its second consecutive major-conference opponent.
But it was the opening eight minutes and the final ten that made the difference for the Crimson, which fell, 57-49.
The Huskies scored the game’s first 11 points and started the game on a 15-2 run, during which time a clearly-flustered young Harvard squad turned it over five times and sophomore wing Wesley Saunders missed an easy dunk.
But at the 12:28 mark of the first half, freshman Siyani Chambers hit a three-pointer, and the Crimson got back in the game from there. Saunders had a layup under the basket, co-captain Christian Webster hit consecutive threes from the top of the key and the right wing, and just like that the Crimson had a 12-0 run and was within one at 15-14.
“When Chambers hit the three, I thought that settled us in a little bit,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Then we got a few stops, and we settled in.”
But UConn’s Ryan Boatright answered right back with a three of his own, and Harvard was unable to take the lead at any point on the night despite cutting the UConn lead to one multiple times.
With 14:33 to go in the second half, Webster drove baseline and found sophomore Jonah Travis underneath for a lefty layup to make it 31-30. Boatright answered with a floater, but Sunders had a back-door, up-and-under layup to pull the Crimson within one again. 
Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard had the chance to give Harvard the lead on its next possession but missed a three; the normally reliable sharpshooter finished one for six from downtown on the night as Harvard failed to pull ahead once again. 
“If we could’ve taken the lead, it changes the psyche of things,” Amaker said. “We couldn’t get to that moment, and I thought that was a big turning point in the game.”
From there, UConn went on a 15-4 run to extend its lead to 48-36, and the Crimson never got within less than nine the rest of the way. 
“We can’t have poor stretches of games where we aren’t efficient and certainly we were that this evening,” Amaker said. “We allowed UConn to take advantage of that and sprint away from us.”
DeAndre Daniels led all scorers with 23 points on 9-of-12 shooting for the Huskies, while Boatright had 16. 
“[Daniels] was a tough matchup for us,” Amaker said. “He seems to be a very versatile player. He delivered tonight.”
Saunders paced the Crimson with 14 points while holding UConn guard Shabbazz Napier—who entered averaging 18.6 points per game—scoreless until there was just 7:39 left in the game. But the Huskies did the same to Crimson rookie point guard Siyani Chambers, who finished with more turnovers (five) than points (three). 
“Chambers was one of our concerns [coming into the game],” UConn coach Kevin Ollie said. “Boatright did an awesome job on him.... We kept him out of the lane. He’s a great penetrator, he’s a great freshman point guard. To limit him really helped our defense.”
It was after the rookie’s first and only basket that got the Crimson going offensively. Once Harvard made it 15-14, it hung with the Huskies for the rest of the first half.
After a Daniels three pushed the lead to 23-16, the Crimson answered with an 8-2 run that was part of a larger 22-7 stretch during which Harvard—after starting one for eight—shot 8 of 12 from the field. Threes by Webster and Rivard and a layup by Moundou-Missi cut the deficit to one at 25-24 with 2:08 to go in the half. 
But Daniels drove baseline on Rivard for a layup to put UConn back up three at 27-24 before the break.
The first few minutes of the second half went back-and-forth, until a 7-0 run capped by a Napier three put UConn up 10, at 44-34, with 7:39 to go.
 The lead got as large as 13 on a Napier jumper with 3:10 remaining as the Crimson, after shooting 5 of 10 from three in the first half, shot just 0 for 6 in the second.
“Great victory today,” Ollie said. “We showed a resilience. We’ve been doing it all year.... Our guys always step up to the challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reading period is finally here! Whether you’re out celebrating being done with classes and catching up on sleep or you’re sitting in the corner of Lamont caffeinating and cramming, why not take a break to look back on the fall semester with Crimson Sports?
From football to polo, here are some of the most interesting and exciting stories that defined the second half of 2012. Let the procrastination begin!
Tradition on the Charles
If you’ve got time to kill, check out this in-depth history of the largest regatta in the world. You’ll learn more than you ever thought you needed to know about competitive rowing. Did you know that the regatta has raised over $650,000 for local charities? By the time you get to the end of this article, you’ll be an expert on all things Charles.
Taking the Lead
Harvard basketball fans—or really anyone with a pulse—you couldn’t have missed the doubt that abounded when two top seniors took a leave of absence at the beginning of the year. This is the story of Christian Webster, who was chosen to lead the newly restructured team. Webster addresses his new role on the team, his disappointing junior season, and how he plans to turn it all around.
Conquering the Open Water
Among the Harvard athletes who chased their Olympic dreams this summer, no story is more compelling than that of Alex Meyer ’10. Finishing 10th place in the 10k, Meyer took to the water in remembrance of his friend Fran Crippen.
Le Takes Unusual Path to Harvard
How does a kicker on a high school football team end up playing women’s soccer at Harvard? Sophomore Mai Le talks about what it was like to be on a team with all men (hint: it wasn’t that different) and how playing football made her a better competitor on and off the field.
A Fine Line
While Harvard may have been disappointed with its final place in the Ivy League standings, the football team has something to celebrate. The offensive line ranked first in the nation in sacks with 42 and second in rushing defense, holding opponents to 2.92 yards per attempt. Go behind the scenes with defensive ends John Lyon and Zach Hodges, who break down Harvard’s dominance.
A Fresh Start for Harvard Polo
If you didn’t know that Harvard had a polo team, you’re missing out. The oldest intercollegiate polo team in the country, the team takes players with no experience and trains them to become expert horsemen.
And on a lighter note, here are some of the funniest columns and blogs from the semester. Go ahead, laugh out loud. I’m sure your fellow Lamonsters won’t mind.
THE BROTHERS SAMUELS: The Game Is Not Even "A Game" Anymore
The incoming and outgoing Crimson presidents take a look back to the days when The Game was actually competitive.
AROUND THE IVIES: Harvard the Heavy Favorite vs. Lions
While its impossible to find an “Around the Ivies” that isn’t funny, this breakdown of the Harvard-Columbia matchup is perhaps columnist Scott Sherman’s most entertaining writing of the football season.
Tweets of the Week: Harvard Beats Yale

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
STORRS, Conn.—When sophomore forward Jonah Travis stepped up to take the jump at the beginning of Friday night’s contest against UConn, he was met at center court by the Huskies center Enosch Wolf, who stands seven inches taller than the Harvard sophomore at 7’1.”
And while Friday marked the Crimson’s second straight game with an undersized starting lineup comprised entirely of players 6’6” and shorter, the UConn post presence proved more challenging than that of the Crimson’s previous opponent, Boston College.
“We needed ball handlers,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker about the decision to go small. “You’re not going to be able to overpower this team, so [it was important] for us to have the best ball handlers on the court. That and being on the road, having our most experienced team on the road.”
As has been the case in several of the Crimson’s games so far this season, Harvard (4-4) got off to a slow start against the Huskies (7-2), falling behind 15-2 to start the game.
But although it eventually dropped the non-conference matchup, 57-49—the Crimson’s fourth loss to the perennial powerhouse under Amaker—Harvard made it a three-point game going into halftime and came within one point of UConn four times over the course of the game.
“When you get off to a bad start, things can go south really fast,” Amaker said. “But we dug in there and put ourselves back within striking distance in this game and other games as well.”
A TALL TASK
Despite averaging just 9.8 points per game on the season before the contest against the Crimson, Huskies forward DeAndre Daniels led all scorers with a career-high 23 points—11 points higher than his previous personal high.
“We were concerned with [UConn’s] peripheral play,” Amaker said. “And as fate would have it, Daniels has an outstanding game.”
Daniels was instrumental in UConn’s initial run, dropping eight in the opening 6:44 of play as the Huskies took a commanding 15-2 lead over the Crimson.
At the end of the first half, the UConn sophomore was an impressive six for seven from the field—good for 15 points—with his only miss coming from three-point range.
Daniels—who went a perfect four for four from the foul line—was the only player on his team to shoot above 50 percent from the charity stripe.
In addition to his impact on the scoreboard, Daniels contributed four rebounds and a steal in the win over Harvard, finishing the night shooting 9 of 12 from the field.
“It was a tough matchup for us,” Amaker said. “[Daniels] seems to be a very versatile player. We were hearing…that they wanted more from him, and he certainly looked like he delivered tonight.”
While the Crimson outrebounded the Huskies, 27-20, UConn capitalized on its six offensive boards, converting nine second-chance points to Harvard’s two.
HARD TO GUARD
Before UConn forward Niels Giffey converted a dunk with 9:53 remaining in the second half off of a steal from junior guard Shabazz Napier, just three Huskies had scored in the contest. Daniels, Boatright, and Wolf, who finished the game with 23, 16, and four points, respectively, combined for all 37 of their teams points in the opening 30:07 of play.
Notably missing from the scoring list was Napier himself, who leads the Huskies in scoring with 17.2 points per game. Napier ended up with six points—the first of which came off of a three-pointer with 7:39 to play in the game.
“[Napier] played the game, and the game dictated him to pass it,” UConn coach Kevin Ollie said. “He made some wonderful passes…. I give him a lot of kudos. He came back. But we want him to be aggressive; we want him to shoot.”
The guard found other ways to contribute to his team’s victory, earning a season-high nine assists on the night, as well as a game-high four steals and seven rebounds to his stat line.
“Their guards are terrific, with their quickness, and they’re very explosive,” Amaker said. “You know at any given time, they’re capable of having bunches of buckets…. It doesn’t have to be with actually scoring.”
Harvard’s scoring was much more balanced. Sophomore wing Wesley Saunders led the way with 14 points, and classmate Steve Moundou-Missi scored 10 of his own, as seven Crimson players added points to the Harvard total.
The Crimson’s bench outscored its UConn counterpart, 12-8, on the game.
According to Ollie, limiting the guards’ impact—particularly that of Chambers—was also a focus for his team.
UConn’s strategy proved successful, as Chambers was held to three points just three days after putting up 21 at Boston College.

Faculty in Harvard's Economics Department are trading their souls for a wish, pennies and dimes for a kiss.
In a YouTube video posted on Thursday, prominent economics professors can be seen dancing and lip-synching to Carly Rae Jepsen's pop hit "Call Me Maybe." The video, which had already been viewed more than 50,000 times Saturday afternoon, was filmed by Emily Neill, the department's undergraduate program administrator, and edited by Noah, her 10-year-old son.
Neill said she created the video to help undergraduates feel that their professors are approachable. She said the hardest part was explaining the idea to faculty members. "I said, 'Okay, there's this popular song'—I was already going to lose there—'and there's this thing called a meme,'" Neill said. "If they made it through my explanation, they were very ready to do it."
Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who breaks out his best moves 2:57 minutes into the video, said the video was created as part of an annual department-wide evening event to honor graduate students.
Mankiw, the department chair, acknowledged that he and his colleagues may not be ready to leave their day jobs for showtime just yet.
"Maybe we needed a little more rehearsal," Mankiw said. "But we didn't get any."
