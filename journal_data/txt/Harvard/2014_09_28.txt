After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A dozen members of the Student Labor Action Movement assembled outside Massachusetts Hall on Friday afternoon to deliver a letter to University President Drew G. Faust, imploring Harvard to cut ties with Teach For America if it does not make several key changes to its program by Oct. 8.
The effort is part of a larger national movement started by United Students Against Sweatshops that criticizes Teach For America, a nation-wide program that recruits college graduates to teach in low-income communities for at least two years, for undermining the quality of public education.
“We’re calling on Harvard to support and provide the resources for people who want want to have lifelong careers in public education, not people who want to teach for a couple of years and then go to law school or business school,” said Blake A. McGhghy ’17, a SLAM member who spearheaded the Harvard branch of the campaign.
The letter to Faust addresses three areas in which students hope to see reforms to Teach For America: demanding the organization only send students to areas in which there is a teaching shortage, providing corps members more education and training, and cutting ties with corporations the students think threaten teachers unions such as Exxon Mobil and JPMorgan Chase.
If the changes are not made, the letter asks that Faust sever ties with the organization, including breaking partnerships such as the Principal Leadership Pipeline through the Graduate School of Education, deferrals and scholarships to Harvard’s graduate schools for TFA alumni, and the recruitment of undergraduates.
Harvard has a long relationship with Teach For America—the organization recruits heavily on-campus and receives support from many faculty members and students, according to Teach For America recruiter Tess Nicholson who was on hand for the assembly. Twenty-nine College graduates joined the corps last year, she added.
Nicholson, a Boston College alumna who just finished teaching as a corps member in East Harlem, New York, watched the event from the side. Nicholson said she saw promotions about the event on social media and decided to attend to reach out to SLAM members in hopes of finding common ground.
“I think if anything this is going to be a starting point for constructive conversation about education reform,” Nicholson said. “I think there’s a lot we agree on, and I’m excited to start there and continue the conversation from there.”
Nicholson said that despite the outcry from Harvard students and other national activists, Teach For America stands by its mission to ensure excellent education for all children. In a letter responding to the activists of the national movement, Teach For America co-CEO Matthew Kramer defended the organization, pointing out that nearly 90 percent of TFA’s 37,000 alumni work in education or in low-income communities. Nicholson said she is confident the organization will continue to be successful in recruiting Harvard students who value education.
“In order to one day end educational inequity, we need to be fostering leaders in all fields related to education,” Nicholson said. “People at Harvard care about education, and the need for dialogue is here.”
SLAM plans to more aggressively urge the University to cut ties with Teach For America if the organization fails to undergo the reforms SLAM members and other advocates across the country deem crucial.
“We don’t say there should be no TFA, we say that major reforms are necessary,” SLAM member Hannah L. McShea ’18 said.
At the rally on Friday, SLAM members waved signs reading “Cut Ties with TFA!” and chanted “education justice.” A few passersby offered members of the group high fives, but few joined in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Carrying a five-game win streak into its tilt on Saturday, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-3, 0-1 Ivy) looked to carry its historic nonconference success into Ivy League play in its opening match at Dartmouth (10-2, 1-0). But the Crimson was unable to extend its streak to six, starting off conference play with a 3-1 loss to the Big Green in Hanover, N.H.
“We were extremely disappointed with starting [Ivy League play] off this way,” co-captain Kristen Casey said. “But at the same time, I think we learned a few tough lessons tonight about preparation.”
The Crimson found itself in a crucial moment tied at 13-13 in the fourth set, needing to win to extend the match to a fifth set. But Dartmouth would take the next six out of seven points, amassing a six-point lead that the Big Green would not concede. Sophomore Stacey Benton sealed the deal with a kill, and the home team emerged victorious in the final set, 25-21.
Sophomore Emily Astarita led the Big Green attack with 15 kills on the day. Paige Caridi and sophomore Molly Kornfeind also recorded double-digit kills, with 14 and 12, respectively.
The Crimson managed to stay in the game with a late comeback in the third set. With the Big Green two points away from sweeping the Crimson to open Ivy League play, three attack errors from Dartmouth and timely kills by senior Caroline Walters and junior Kathleen Wallace forced a fourth set that the Crimson would be unable to capitalize.
But when the Crimson found itself in the opposite position in the first set—up in the late stages of the set, the team was unable to close it out. Up 21-19, Harvard would go on to lose the next four points. Although the team would tie it up at 25 points apiece, two attack errors from the Crimson would hand the first set to Dartmouth. Harvard—which has relied heavily on late set performance—was consistently outplayed by the Big Green at the ends of sets.
“They were getting three blockers up on our middles and playing really good defense,” Casey said. “We just haven’t seen that from many opponents and…struggled to find other ways to score for a while.”
The second set didn’t go much better for the Crimson. Again, the squad found itself in position to challenge Dartmouth for the second set, tied 8-8. But Dartmouth won the next four points, and 12 out of the next 19, to take a commanding 20-15 lead.
Junior Caroline Holte led the Crimson offense with 11 kills and a 46 percent kill to attack percentage. Walters was close behind with 10 of her own and a 30 percent ratio, and sophomore Corie Bain—who leads the team with 97 kills on the season—registered nine. Bain and junior Hannah Schmidt aided the attack with 21 and 19 assists, respectively.
Saturday marked Dartmouth’s first home game of the season. The Big Green had managed to go 9-2 in nonconference play, all of which was on the road.
Playing on the road was not one of Harvard’s strengths in last year’s campaign. The squad finished 4-6 on the road, including a 3-2 loss to Dartmouth.
“I think we are going in with a much better focus for road games [than last year],” Holte said. “We have a routine before the game…little things to get our heads in the game before we start playing and control the things we can control.”
The Crimson will start off in a hole in its ambition to be crowned Ivy League champion, but such a feat is familiar. The team started off 1-2 last year but still managed to secure second place in the Ancient Eight.
“It’s better that we have a game like this early on if it’s going to…force us to learn some lessons,” Casey said. “The Ivy League title is still very much our goal."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The outcome of the women's soccer game between Harvard and Penn has been determined by home-field advantage for the past six years. With the Crimson traveling to face the Quakers for its Ivy opener on Saturday night, Harvard’s chances of winning seemed against the odds. But the Crimson decided it was time to change that history.
In a critical contest between last year’s top-two finishers in Ancient Eight, Harvard put together a stellar second half to top Penn, 3-0. This was the Crimson’s first win at Rhodes Field since 2006.
Harvard coach Ray Leone secured four Ivy League Championships before getting this elusive road win against the Quakers (3-2-2, 0-1 Ivy) since he started with Harvard (6-2-0, 1-0) eight years ago.
“To Penn’s credit, they are so difficult to play at home or away,” Leone said. “The intensity of the game was through the roof. And a goal needed to happen for either team to break it open...because it was so tightly fought in that first half.”
And that’s what happened in the 55th minute.
After using her speed to fly past three Quaker defenders, Crimson sophomore forward Midge Purce hit a chip shot that floated over the head of Penn’s junior goalkeeper, Kalijah Terilli, to give Harvard a 1-0 advantage.
“We got that first goal and it relaxed us a little bit,” Leone said. “We started to move the ball around better and create chances.”
The Crimson continued to apply offensive pressure throughout the second half. In the 70th minute, junior forward Emily Mosbacher headed a cross from co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby over the outstretched arms of Terilli and into the far right post to give Harvard a 2-0 lead.
Three minutes later, the Crimson added another insurance goal when Purce weaved her way past multiple Quaker defenders and connected for her second goal of the game. Purce, who had not converted any of her 14 shots in Harvard’s previous five games, found her rhythm in the team’s Ivy debut. She continued right where she left off in conference play last season, in which she led the league with 11 goals.
“[Purce] always works really hard and I think it was just a matter of her finishing the chances she got,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “She puts herself in really good position and gets a lot of chances. She was composed enough to finish them in this game.”
Although the game finished with the Crimson in total command, it did not start that way.
Momentum shifted back-and-forth in the first half. Strong, physical play from both sides kept the ball concentrated at midfield and limited offensive opportunities. Both teams managed just two shots in the half.
Penn nearly jumped out to an early lead in the 30th minute of the game when Harvard senior goalkeeper Cheta Emba fumbled a corner kick and the ball trickled to Penn’s junior back Shannon Hennessy. Amidst traffic, Hennessy got off a shot on an open goal. But Crimson junior defender Alika Keene managed to get her right foot on the ball to keep it from reaching the back of the net.
The Quakers began to dominate possession and apply offensive pressure for the duration of the first half. Penn continued to drive the ball deep into Harvard’s half of the field, but the Crimson back line repeatedly stopped the Quakers before they could convert this momentum into scoring attempts.
“They put a lot of pressure on us in the first half, so it took some time to adjust and be able to do our thing,” Leone said.
In the second half, Harvard found its rhythm. The team converted three of its four shots and kept Penn from taking a single shot on goal.
“We brought everything we had in the second half,” Margolius said. “We just kept our energy up and knew the chances were coming and that we were going to put them away.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On an unseasonably warm Saturday in the final weekend of September, the Harvard women’s rugby team pounded Cornell for its first home win of the season, 75-0. The Crimson (2-1, 2-1 Ivy) handed the Big Red (2-1, 2-1) its first loss of the season by overwhelming Cornell’s defense, which had surrendered a mere five points through its first two games.
It took Harvard just four minutes to put up five points on the scoreboard. After the Crimson gained possession out of the scrum, freshman wing Tessa Muss ran the ball to the outside to score a try and give Harvard the early lead. In her rugby debut, Muss wasted no time making a difference. With two more successful tries in the game, she recorded a hat-trick in her rookie outing.
Muss was just one of a handful of new faces who debuted and contributed on the field for the Crimson. Freshman center Isabel DeLaura, sophomore prop Ina Kodra, and freshman lock Rachel Chapman also turned in strong performances, having played just a handful of contests this season. For head coach Sue Parker, the successful integration of these rookies highlighted the game.
“Our goal was to make sure that all of our many, many rookies who were on the field today had a great experience,” Parker said. “We wanted to keep our team framework phase after phase, try to maintain possession, play in our attacking side of the field, and always have a lot of support. Absolutely I feel like we accomplished that and I think they all came off the field today having had a phenomenal experience.”
In the seventh minute of the game, the Big Red attempted to bounce back and even the score. Cornell won possession out of the scrum and sophomore full-back Mara Jacobs kicked the ball downfield. After the Big Red recovered the kick, a series of quick passes set up sophomore fly-half Angela Wang for a try attempt. But the Harvard defense took Wang down from behind to preserve its lead.
In its last two contests, the Crimson has not surrendered a try, outscoring its opponents, 129-0.
“All of our defensive schemes are built around total teamwork,” Parker said. “Our recent success is a reflection that all 15 people on the field all the time are giving maximum effort, talking to each other, and maintaining the wall in front of the ball. Even when the team has a line break like Cornell had several times today, we have excellent composure in stopping them before they can get into the try zone.”
With just under 30 minutes left, Harvard went on an offensive surge. Successful tries by senior flank Lenica Morales-Valenzuela, senior fullback Aniebiet Abasi, and sophomore fly-half Taciana Pereira gave the Crimson a 43-0 advantage at the half.
Abasi paced Harvard’s offense in this mismatched contest. On four separate occasions, Abasi used her speed to take the ball nearly the entire length of the field en route to a pair of successful tries in each half.
“[Abasi’s] performance speaks for itself,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “But she’s really only successful when we utilize our teamwork to get that ball to her. Regardless of the fact that she’s flying down the field and it’s awesome to watch, it happens because we did something as a team to make it happen.”
The Crimson maintained its offensive pressure in the second half. Crisp passing allowed Harvard to spread the line and continue to break through the Big Red’s defense.
In the final two minutes of the game, Cornell made a last-minute attempt to get on the scoreboard. The Big Red’s junior prop, Alanna Grossman, broke a series of tackles before Kantor brought her down with a strong tackle and recovered the ball for the Crimson. After a series of Harvard passes, Kantor again inserted herself into the play with a drive down the field that set up Morales-Valenzuela for the final score of the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not have been the prettiest of victories, but the Harvard football team won its first sash in the pageant that is the Ivy League title race.
As the fireworks exploded over Brown Stadium, it was the Crimson (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) that wore the crown as Brown (0-2, 0-1) sulked into the darkness on Friday night. Despite occasional blunders and inexperience on both teams, Harvard launched a fourth-quarter comeback to beat the Bears, 22-14.
After the first score, a botched snap resulted in Crimson freshman quarterback Joseph Viviano III successfully running the pigskin in for the two-point conversion, but Viviano’s attempt was deemed no good by the officials for having already taken a knee and come up for the kick before the rush.
Problems on special teams continued. On Harvard’s first drive of the second quarter, a 37-yard field goal attempt by senior Ben Fallon sailed wide right, and while a 22-yard field goal try by classmate Andrew Flesher in the fourth quarter was good, Flesher’s final kick for an extra point was not.
“We’ve got two quality kickers,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “[When] you miss an extra point, it’s hard to explain, but the bottom line is that we feel like we have two quality kickers.”
Hiccups were not limited to special teams, as Brown and Harvard combined for a total of 10 penalties and over 100 yards yielded as a result, including a targeting call on Brown linebacker Michael Walsh that resulted in his ejection from the game and part of the Bears’ next contest.
“The tough thing about FCS Division I is that you don’t have instant replay where most of the time you probably need it [to] verify that,” said Murphy about the personal foul on Walsh. “It’s always a tough call, but it’s something that is foremost in the minds of officials and appropriately so.”
SCOTT-FREE
After playing little more than one quarter as signal caller coming into Saturday’s matchup, quarterback Scott Hosch took the reins from injured senior starter Conner Hempel for his debut Ivy start. The junior, who completed eight of 12 passes last weekend against Holy Cross, netted 234 yards passing and 20 on the ground this go-around.
“[Hosch] was well prepared,” Murphy said. “He’s a very poised kid. I thought under the circumstances—a tough, aggressive, attack-type blitz team [like Brown]—he played very well.”
Hosch proved himself a dual threat, working in and out of the pocket, as he passed for his first collegiate touchdown and ran in the final decisive score of the game.
With 2:11 left in the first quarter and the game still scoreless, Hosch dropped back from a shotgun formation and fired off a bullet to junior wideout Andrew Fischer. Fischer, hotly pursued by Brown defensive back Will Quigley, dove for the pass and connected in the far back left corner of the end zone, putting the Crimson on the board, 6-0.
Much later, with just over two minutes left in the contest, Hosch displayed his versatility by cutting right to an open route with an option run. Just three yards later, his touchdown scramble put the Crimson on top, 22-14, with a conclusive try.
“With the second touchdown, that was all the [offensive] line,” Hosch said. “That was a huge hole. I could have walked in.”
As there is still little indication of whether Hempel’s back injury will allow him to consistently compete in the coming games, Hosch may have to continue playcalling for the Crimson. His chance at playing time comes from an experience- and improvement-related jump from the third spot in the depth chart to the second.
“That’s just a credit to our strength and conditioning staff,” Hosch said. “This summer was a big summer for me. Being down in the three-position, I knew I had to improve my strength and my quickness.”
THE USUAL SUSPECTS
With Fischer easing back into play and classmate Paul Stanton returning as tailback after a week off with injury, two of Harvard’s more tested offensive weapons packed a punch when needed.
Fischer doubled both the number of catches and the yardage he notched last weekend, as Hosch tossed screen pass after screen pass to the third-year. Stanton posted 120 yards, his second-highest mark at Harvard, including a 43-yard breakaway touchdown run that saw him shake off a tackle in the scrum and run clear to Brown’s end zone.
“[With] the long run by Stanton, we had the right defense call,” Brown coach Phil Estes said. “That should have been a zero yard or should have been for a loss…. We should have had someone there.”

A half-dead triceratops, the Three Musketeers (all mysteriously stuck in one body), and a fingerless R. Kelly walk into a party. No, this is not MIT pledge week. This is Science Center lecture hall A, jam-packed on a Friday night.
And people say Harvard students don’t party.
Greeted by a blackboard full of cultural memes ranging from #yesallwomen to @JoeBiden, Harvard students of all stripes gathered together to see On Thin Ice’s first improv show of the year, “Trial By Fire.” What they got was an hour full of excitement, hilarity, and, as you will see in the following scenes, some close calls.
A mother giving birth on a game show.“Does anyone have an epidural on them? AND IS MY PLACENTA SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE THIS?!"Sadly, nobody had an epidural. On the bright side, her placenta looked picturesque.
A tour guide in a museum.“This is our largest collection of stuffed humans.”Looks like the folks at OTI got a sneak peak at the Harvard Art Museum’s brand new renovations.
An angry spouse to a recently liberated Statue of Liberty, on pointe, hands in 5th position.“Honey, if you want to be a little teapot, then where’s your God damn spout?”Nothing like a nursery rhyme and a little profanity to spice up the marriage, hey OTI? An excerpt from Young New Zealand, an original novel by Kiwi P. Maori. Dedicated to the New Zealand All Blacks.“Then, suddenly, the Fire Captain heard a smell.”Hemingway, Shakespeare, Ellison, Maori: The soon-to-be-erected Mount Rushmore of Literature. Proust had madeleines, OTI has synesthesia.
Someone in the audience, still amazed that they go to Harvard, upon recognizing Sam B. Clark ‘15.“That is the guy from the Harvard tours Yale video. THAT IS THE GUY FROM HARVARD TOURS YALE!!”Yes. Yes it is.
So next time you see a flyer outside the Science Center advertising “Free Tuba Lessons,” signed with the notorious initials, OTI, you just might want to check it out. Because let’s face it: the chance to see your favorite UC President improvise a Dirty Dancing lift alongside a fingerless R. Kelly is the real reason you chose Harvard.
Just remember: even though the shows are free, they are still, of course, BYOE (Bring Your Own Epidural).
