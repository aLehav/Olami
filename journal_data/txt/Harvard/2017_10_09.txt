After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Wednesday, Sept. 20, Pete Souza, Former White House photographer for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, drew a full room in the JFK Forum at the Institute of Politics. Though Souza discussed his experiences with both presidents, he primarily focused on Obama’s, as the release date for his upcoming book, “Obama: An Intimate Portrait,” edges nearer.
Anne Marie Lipinski, a curator at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, introduced Souza to the audience.  First, Souza opened his work with a few highlights from Reagan’s terms. One particularly amusing photo included Michael Jackson, standing behind Reagan and his wife, Nancy, as they engage in what seems like a quarrel.
With Obama, Souza’s work began before he became the president. In January 2005, Souza began to shoot for Obama as he was sworn in as junior senator of Illinois. Souza showcased photos of then-senator Obama before delving into the images that will be a part of his upcoming book. This part of the event went through contrasting points in Obama’s presidency: beginning and end, good and bad, personal and occupational, aesthetically pleasing and narratively informative. He claimed that President Lyndon B. Johnson’s White House photographer, Yoichi Okamoto, was his inspiration during Obama’s presidency.
The pictures themselves were intimate, often portraying Obama alone or with close family and friends. Other times the photos display what happens behind closed doors during historical events. Souza claims to have gotten lucky with some of the iconic Obama images. In one picture, Souza snapped Obama waving on the top of an airplane staircase, a rainbow behind the president’s figure, as if it was curving out from his hand.
Behind the lens, Souza offered a lot of personal insight into Obama’s life. He said that he believes that if asked, Obama would say that the Sandy Hook shooting was the worst day of his life. Souza also remarked that during Biden’s son’s funeral, Obama could not look at Biden during his speech. He mused about the enthusiasm with which Obama coached his daughter, Sasha’s, basketball team, deeming it comparable to the level of an NBA coach.
One photo of Obama and his wife, Michelle, in the backseat of a limousine uncovered a humorous story. Souza said that when he asked Obama whether he could sit in the limousine with them to take a photo, Obama answered, “Well, Michelle and I were planning to make out.”
Souza said that with the 1.9 million pictures that he took of Obama, it was a challenge to choose which 300 pictures to include in the book. He said that Obama told him, “Boy, you’ve got to choose the aesthetic over the narrative.” For Souza, however, the aesthetic was beyond what a photographer may capture in lighting and position—the aesthetic was the narrative of the President itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For almost 50 years, visiting faculty members in Visual and Environmental Studies have joined the department on a temporary basis to share their experiences with students. This year, the VES Visiting Faculty exhibition displays the work of Judith Belzer, Ken Okiishi, Elle Pérez, and Richard Renaldi. The exhibition successfully brings together a diverse selection of two-dimensional visual art.
Judith Belzer’s work, strikingly colorful and purposefully abstract, forms the first part of the exhibition. The seven square panels maintain a similar color scheme, yet differ in vibrancy, forming a gradient from bright to subdued, then lighting up again. Sharper and thicker strokes defines pieces with rich hues, while blurrier marks that outline obscure shapes blend the dimmer pieces. Her pieces are distinct from the other artists, standing out as the only oil paintings.
Where Belzer’s work is exciting and colorful, Elle Pérez’s archival pigment prints are quietly erotic and lonely. Each piece focuses on one character or subject, such as a ratty shirt in “Binder” (2015). Eroticism is suggested by the nakedness of the subjects or by mages like disheveled sheets. They achieve a sort of raw loneliness through the focus on a singular subject, mostly using a black-and-white filter.
The archival pigment print form also appears in Richard Renaldi’s work, which elegantly displays the grittiness of New York. Consistent use of black and white gives his images a visual unity. The figures in his art range from a same-sex couple in “I  HEART NY” t-shirts, to a man with face tattoos wearing sunglasses, to a scantily clad woman climbing up a staircase. All the scenes contain skyscrapers and street intersections that are characteristic of cities. Renaldi’s photos successfully showcase the quirks and diversity of an urban environment through the camera lens.
Ken Okiishi’s art invokes simple messages with technological props, comprised of: television screens covered in paint. Sometimes images play on the screens: crowds of moving people or fuzzy white static. “Being and/or Time, 2013-2016” is a 17-minute-long HD video that flashes social media texts, airplane tickets, celebrity figures, and newspaper articles in a seemingly never-ending slideshow.
Overall, the exhibition displays a variety of artistic expression and media, as well as diversity within the pieces. The placement and proximity of the works to one another creates an intense viewing experience, making the Carpenter Center’s first exhibition of the school year definitely worth seeing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One brisk Wednesday morning in October last year, I woke up at six. The rest of the world still hadn’t shaken off the night, shadows of the day before still looming dark in the sky above me. Everything was still, and I kept thinking about that silence, the way it wrapped around my body, heavy with anticipation as I flew down five flights of stairs and rushed to the back of Annenberg. I fastened the pin to my hoodie and sought out a sign, hoping I wasn’t late.
I wasn’t. The HUDS workers had just begun to assemble themselves in a circle, strapping fluorescent orange Home Depot buckets to their necks like armor, steeling themselves with drumsticks in one hand and picket signs in the other. They began to march, chanting in both Spanish and English. Reporters arrived and the area was suddenly swarming with cameras, people vying to get a quote from the workers on strike or their supporters. All the while, members of the Student Labor Action Movement handed out flowers to strikers as a sign of solidarity.
And that silence? It vanished quickly, and for a long time. For 22 days silence, hung its hat in the dining hall and picked up a bullhorn. The strike became the talk of the town, and wherever you were on campus, there was sure to be discussion of it in some way, shape or form—why Harvard was being unnecessarily greedy and heartless, why the HUDS workers were “interrupting midterms”, how much noise the strike made, how food options were thinning due to safety or monetary concerns.
As HUDS workers continued to put their financial security in jeopardy in fighting this noble cause, the stakes rose and the picket signs were held even higher. Students organized demonstrations, left in the middle of classes to show support, staged a sit-in in the lobby of 124 Mt. Auburn St. Tensions were high, and many wondered how long this would last, if the HUDS workers could continue these arduous efforts to proclaim their rights and if Harvard could continue to ignore the pleas of their suffering workers.
Then, one day, it was all over. News of the strike’s end and the agreement reached between Local 26 and University representatives broke, and a sigh of relief rippled throughout the University. Paper plates were replaced with trays, and John came back to greet freshman in Annenberg with a campus-wide smile spread across his face—but something was off. No, it wasn’t that smile, nor the motivation of the strike, nor the return to the routine.
It was the agreement in and of itself. It took Harvard 22 days (or really longer, considering the discussions were in the works before the strike was decided upon) to reach the conclusion that these workers deserved livable wages and affordable healthcare. Their original proposals would have been a significant burden on the average worker making $35,000 a year (which was not even the minimum before the strike). As the most influential university in the world, it is disheartening that it took so long to reach this conclusion. HUDS workers played and continue to play a valuable role in shaping the way in which community develops within dining halls throughout campus. The implications of the time taken to make the right decision had a staggering effect on many of the HUDS families involved in the strike. Although the compromise did include many of the original demands or modified versions of them, such as lowered co-pay rates, eliminated deductibles, a modest raise, and prorated stipends, the families suffered a little over a month without any health care and experienced job insecurity  because they had the courage to speak out against an unjust system. Harvard’s decision was the right one, but at a time which should have come sooner.
When the decision was announced outside of the First Parish Church, the relief felt by the HUDS workers in the crowd was tangible and heavy. Olga, a veteran Portuguese HUDS worker in Annenberg and a new friend, turned to me with tears brimming in her eyes. With a month’s time of weariness snuggled tight between her thick coat and scarf, she softened, shoulders laxing under the strain of buckets and bullhorns, 6 a.m. marches and weeks of fighting for a just cause. She had won.
Though I don’t see John or Olga much these days, I’m reminded of their struggle every day when I walk into the dining hall and see smiling faces decked in orange, looking back at me. I’m reminded of their struggle when I speak to my own mother, a former cafeteria worker in a school for seven years. HUDS’ win transcends the Harvard campus and will act as a template for all other schools around the nation—maybe even my mother’s as well.

Life at this prestigious institution is a great experience. Students from over 153 countries and from across all 50 states get to mix and mingle—as do their germs. We guarantee that sooner or later one of the following maladies will have you heading to HUHS for some treatment… And probably to a few other hospitals as well. After all, if you haven't spent time in quarantine, do you even go to Harvard?
Mono
Awkward eye contact in Annenberg isn’t the only consequence of sloppy makeouts at sweaty parties. If you think you’re safe because you had mono in high school, think again. The student you exchanged saliva with could be from anywhere in the world (or simply an intruder from Northeastern University), meaning you might just encounter a new strain. It’s rare, but be on the lookout.
Strep
Same symptoms as mono, but for people who spend their Saturday nights doing psets rather than going out. At least you can catch up on those readings while you’re out of class.
Chronic common cold
This is most serious for freshmen who don’t know how to take care of themselves. After the second month of surviving on cough drops and Nyquil-induced sleep, you’ll be longing for your mom to appear at the side of your flimsy, college-issue bunk bed. At this point, we’ve got no hope or advice left for you. We’re pretty sure Berg orange juice contains no vitamin C. Just turn the other way when you sneeze, please.
Mumps
By this point just a fact of Harvard life, this archaic disease has ravaged campus for the past few years. Honestly, at this point, there's no one to blame but yourself. Hasn't Paul J. Barreira told you more than enough time to wash your damn hands?
Something you’ve never heard of before
If you don’t recognize any of the words in your HUHS diagnosis, don’t panic. You’re not special. There are a lot of weird diseases lurking around campus. We’re wondering: is it Hand, Foot and Mouth disease or Foot, Mouth and Hand? Does the order even matter? And why is it capitalized?
A literal WW2 disease
Harvard takes its status as the oldest university in the United States pretty seriously, and this extends to its illnesses as well. Sure, tuberculosis may not be commonly found in industrialized countries anymore, but that doesn’t mean we can’t have it.
If you’ve gone six for six, keep going. Your Harvard career has only just begun, so we trust that you’ll find plenty more opportunities to get sick. And no, throwing up in the bathroom at school-sponsored events does not count. That’s just plain gross.
