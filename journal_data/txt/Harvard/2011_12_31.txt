After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just under two minutes to play, junior guard Brandyn Curry drove down the lane and navigated through a maze of Saint Joseph’s defenders, scoring a lefty layup to give the No. 23/24 Harvard men’s basketball team its first lead since early in the first half.
On the Crimson’s next possession, junior forward Kyle Casey drained a three-pointer to stretch the lead to four, and the Crimson (12-1) held on to earn the comeback victory, dropping the Hawks (10-4), 74-69.
For both teams, it was a tale of two halves. As it had done two days earlier at Boston College, Harvard’s defense had no answer for St. Joe’s at the start of the game and quickly fell behind by double digits.
But the Hawks continued to attack throughout the half. Led by the sharpshooting backcourt of sophomore Langston Galloway and junior Carl Jones, the Hawks shot a shade under 80 percent from the field en route to a 48-point first half, the Crimson’s worst defensive frame all season.
Saint Joseph’s, which missed only five shots from the field in the half, scored more points than four of Harvard’s previous opponents did in entire games, and the Crimson went into the locker room down 10.
But the Hawks offense cooled down considerably in the second half, and Harvard’s Casey caught fire. St. Joe’s made only eight field goals in the second half and shot under 30 percent as the Hawks watched their lead slowly dwindle.
Casey scored 20 of his season-high 26 points in the half, including a dominant stretch in the final few minutes when he scored five quick points on a 9-0 Crimson run that helped seal the come-from-behind win.
“He’s an incredibly talented player,” said co-captain Keith Wright, who paced the Crimson offense early on and finished the game with 16 points. “[Casey] just has to believe that he can play like this day in and day out.”
Surrendering 48 points in the first half was uncharacteristic from a team whose success has largely been built on its defense. But the Crimson was all but helpless for the first 20 minutes of the game.
Jones, who finished the game with a team-high 22 points for the Hawks, made six of eight shots from the field to lead his team in the first half.
Galloway scored 15 first-half points and was a perfect 5-for-5 from the field, including three from behind the arc. Sophomore C.J. Aikan, who anchors the Hawks’ defense with an average of four blocks per game, showed impressive touch from outside while scoring seven first-half points.
“Give them credit,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought if we could just hang in there, they wouldn’t be able to continue shooting 80 percent.”
Despite Saint Joseph’s success on the floor, the Crimson managed to stick around in the first half thanks in part to a strong performance from Wright, who scored 10 points in the frame despite coverage from Aikan.
“We always try to establish an inside presence,” said Amaker. “Keith was huge. He’s been our force.”
But despite Wright’s efforts, Harvard trailed by as much as 13 before co-captain Oliver McNally nailed a three-pointer as time expired in the first half to send the Crimson in to the locker room down 10.
The Crimson slowly clawed its way back into the game in the second half. Harvard cut the deficit to seven early in the half but was unable to get any closer until a Wright layup cut the lead to five with just under nine minutes to play.
St. Joe’s pushed the lead back to seven before Hawks sophomore forward Halil Kanacevic drew an ill-timed technical foul. McNally sank the ensuing free throws to close the gap, and a three-point play from Casey cut the St. Joseph’s lead to two as the momentum began to swing.
But a Hawks free throw and a jumper from Aiken pushed the Crimson’s deficit to five with under six minutes to play.
With the game winding down, Wright scored two on a put-back to pull the Crimson to within three. On Harvard’s next possession, Casey picked up an offensive rebound and drew a foul as he finished the layup. The score brought the Crimson to within one, the junior but couldn’t convert on what would have been the game-tying free throw.
Once again, the Hawks tried to pull away. Jones stole a pass on the Crimson’s next possession and scored in transition to put St. Joseph’s up, 68-65, with just over three minutes to play.
But from that point on, Harvard took control. Casey nailed a fall-away jumper, Curry’s layup gave Harvard a one-point lead, and Casey drove home the dagger as he nailed a three-pointer with just over 30 seconds to play.
“We’re a veteran team, we’ve been in situations like this before,” Casey said. “We knew we weren’t going to come back in one shot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While it was Kyle Casey who finished the game for the Harvard men’s basketball team in its 74-69 victory over St. Joseph’s on Saturday afternoon, it was the Crimson’s other starting big man who kept the team alive early.
After scoring just eight points on 3-of-9 shooting at Boston College on Thursday night, co-captain Keith Wright carried Harvard’s offense throughout the first half.
The 6’8” forward posted 10 of his 16 points in the opening frame, shooting 5-of-8 from the field.
“Keith was huge especially because he struggled in our last game scoring and finishing on the inside,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker of the forward, who scored eight of the Crimson’s first 24 points. “He’s been our force. Being able to establish him early was key for us.”
When a Ronald Roberts’ jumper with 11:16 to go in the first half put the visitors ahead by 14, it was Wright who got the Crimson back in the game.
The forward went to work in the post, finishing the Crimson’s first field goal in over two minutes to pull within 12. Following a Papa Ndao turnover, Harvard went back to Wright, and this time the co-captain dropstepped his way to the basket and converted an easy layup.
Two minutes later, Wright brought the Crimson within five, converting a tough layup despite facing a double team. Wright added one more basket before the half ended, bringing his first-half total to 10.
Wright managed to have success in the post despite being guarded by the Hawks’ 6’9” forward C.J. Aiken, who entered the contest averaging 4.3 blocked shots per game.
“Once I saw that he was in me, I just used my body and my wide frame to create contact, so he wouldn’t be able to get that jump,” Wright explained.
Wright was quiet early in the second half, not attempting a shot until 10:36 remained in the contest. But he managed to add six more points on 3-of-6 shooting to close out the game, bringing his scoring total to 16.
DOUBLE TROUBLE
Heading into Saturday’s contest, the Crimson knew it was going to have its hands full with St. Joseph’s talented backcourt duo of junior Carl Jones and sophomore Langston Galloway, who entered the game averaging 18.5 and 16 points per game, respectively.
The pair lived up to its reputation as a dangerous offensive package, combining for 37 points, more than half the Hawks’ total output, on 14-of-27 shooting.
“They’re extremely quick,” Amaker said of Jones and Galloway. “They obviously can make shots off the pass and off the bounce. They can get to the basket. They’re a handful. We talked about them being similar in a lot of ways to the guards [Shabazz Napier and Jeremy Lamb] we had to go against at UConn.”
The pair was especially deadly in the first half, as Galloway shot a perfect 5-of-5 from the field and 3-of-3 from beyond the arc for 13 points. Jones notched 15 points on 6-of-8 shooting.
But both guards were unable to keep up the pace in the second half, combining for just three made field goals. Jones struggled in particular, missing all four three-pointers he tried.
Galloway and Jones finished with 15 and 22 points, respectively.
A TALE OF TWO HALVES
It was a wild first half at Lavietes Pavilion. For 20 minutes, St. Joseph’s could not miss. The visiting Hawks opened the game shooting 9-of-19 from the field and didn’t let up for the remainder of the half, finishing the period 19-of-24 from the field and 6-of-9 from beyond the arc.
“They’re an explosive offensive team,” Amaker said. “In transition, it was very difficult for us.”
St. Joseph’s 48 first-half points was the most Crimson had allowed all season. The previous high was 34, posted by Holy Cross just two games into the season.
In fact, Harvard allowed 48 or fewer points total in wins over Boston College, Vermont, Florida State, and Utah.
But after missing just five shots from the field and shooting 79.2 percent in the first half, the Hawks cooled off, making just eight field goals on 29.6 percent shooting in the second.
