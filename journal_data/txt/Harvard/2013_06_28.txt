INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA--Hearing the ring of cowbells at a ski jumping hill would seem odd to most.  But in Innsbruck, Austria the cowbells serve as a soundtrack to the sport. As a former ski jumper, I had become pretty accustomed to tuning out overzealous, bell-ringing children, pestering parents and athletes alike as they eagerly cheered on competitors. This time however, I was not the competitor. I was the sister, and the visitor penetrating the Stams Ski Academy bubble.
As I strolled in the direction of the ski jump, I was greeted by the first of many pleasant surprises. Cowbells in their original form: literally hung around the necks of a family of adorable, light brown, Tyrolean cows.
Wandering further along an alpine road, camera slung over my right shoulder, I couldn't help but breathe deeply and just sigh at how lucky my sister is to study and train in such an idyllic locale. The rush of a speeding Audi zipping past ripped me out of my daydream and prompted me to continue on my quest to find the jump.
Stares and hushed whispers about a "personal photographer" marked my eventual appearance at the base lodge. A few handshakes and my first encounter with a single-seat chairlift later, and I was on top of the mountain. With my back to the "big hill" and my eyes on the 70 meter jump, I perched myself precariously on the edge of the coach’s stand, and watched in silence.
The familiar grind of skis against the porcelain summer track, the audible grunt on the take-off, the airy whoosh of the athlete cushioning themselves on a pillow of air, and the ultimate slap of the skis on the watered plastic landing hill instantly brought back so many summer memories. Memories of sweating in Steamboat, walking up through the trees, pondering in Park City, riding the chair between jumps, and shielding my eyes from the sun in Chicago as I peered out over suburbia all flooded back.
Akin to my wandering thoughts, my conversation with the head coach Gary meandered in and out. I found it fascinating to listen to his instructions and suggestions directed at the athletes. I don't know why I hadn't considered it before, but it was just a little jarring hearing it all in German. All the coaching was the same, just the words specifically were different: late, on time, less arms, more legs, longer push, don't bullshit the landing.
Slowly, my sober reflection transformed into humorous observation as I soaked in additional language differences around me. I remember my mom mentioning something about my sister's funny new dialect, but I didn't really notice it at the time. Initially, I was simply amused to hear that my sister Nina's brevity had, without fail, taken root in her German elocution. But three years later, now even I notice that she just sounds incredibly Austrian. It's hilarious. I am normally pretty adept at fitting in with my German, but I suddenly found myself to be the odd one out with my proper Hochdeutsch, a dialect apparently only apropos in the classroom.
Learning the language of her sport, learning the language of her rigid academic life, and learning the language of her Austrian peers, Nina has certainly succeeded in adjusting to the Austrian lifestyle. Nevertheless, it certainly hasn’t been easy. Nina will eagerly contest that the trials and tribulations of being one of only two internationals at her school are never ending, "Seriously Danielle, they discriminate against me! It's just not fair. Sorry (I'm not sorry) I'm an American."
Although it has been quite a challenge, I remain exceedingly jealous of the opportunities the elite winter sports school has given her: the constant travel around Europe (next week she will take a casual weekend trip to compete in Slovenia), the ability to navigate two languages fluently (both in and outside of the classroom), and most importantly, the friends and contacts worldwide she has made for life. I don’t know how she does it. If I were at Stams, I would constantly skip training on the nice days, jog up into the mountains, throw on a dirndl and prance around singing "the hills are alive..."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 30-count federal indictment against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev charged him with killing four people and using weapons of mass destruction, among other counts, officials said Thursday.
Tsarnaev, a former Cambridge Rindge and Latin School student who previously worked as a lifeguard at a Harvard pool, could face the death penalty for 17 charges against him, and could serve life in prison for the rest.
According to the indictment, Tsarnaev scrawled a series of messages on the inside of the dry-docked boat in the Watertown backyard where he hid from police on April 19. Included among his written messages were the phrases, “The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians” and “Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.”
The indictment also says Tsarnaev downloaded publications containing material related to al-Qaeda and Islamic jihad. One downloaded publication, the online Inspire magazine published by al-Qaeda, included instructions on how to build a bomb, and another “glorifies martyrdom in the service of jihad,” the indictment reads.
According to the indictment, Tsarnaev placed and detonated a bomb near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, killing two people. The indictment alleges that the explosion came just seconds after Tsarnaev’s late brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, detonated the first of the two bombs, which killed Krystle M. Campbell. Campbell was a former Harvard Business School employee, and her mother and brother work at the University.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is also charged with causing the April 18 fatal shooting of MIT police officer Sean A. Collier through the use of a firearm. The indictment alleges that the two brothers shot Collier in the head at close range with a semiautomatic handgun.
Following the shooting, Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a firefight with law enforcement officials in the early morning of April 19, and a widespread manhunt for Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev that Friday paralyzed the Greater Boston area and shut down the University. Tsarnaev was captured by police that evening after he was found hiding in the boat in the Watertown backyard.
Tsarnaev is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on July 10.

With the renovation of Old Quincy reaching its final weeks, construction on Leverett’s McKinlock Hall is heating up.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Colin Manning, Old Quincy is scheduled to be completed before undergraduates return to campus in August. McKinlock construction, slated to be completed prior to the 2014-2015 school year, began immediately after Commencement and is now “progressing.”
We didn’t get anything more specific than that from Harvard, so we went to scope out the scene ourselves. Check out Flyby’s photos of the two construction sites to see what the buildings look like from the outside.
Construction on Old Quincy began last year as a “test project” for House renewal, the University’s $1 billion plan to eventually turn all 12 upperclassman Houses into temporary construction zones. Once the renovations are complete, both Old Quincy and Old Lev will feature the addition of horizontal hallways, cluster communities, and more common spaces—features that haven’t won over all Quincy residents.
