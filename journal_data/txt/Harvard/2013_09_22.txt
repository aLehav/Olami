After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The talking points that have accompanied Glaswegian synthpop band Chvrches’ explosive rise to fame may ring some bells: Two beatmakers and a charismatic frontwoman release a trickle of catchy singles onto SoundCloud, accumulate a massive amount of hype and followers, tour heavily on two continents, release an EP, accumulate even more hype, and then drop their first proper album. It’s a familiar trajectory nowadays—and it’s also one that can just as easily launch careers as send them crashing down to earth again.
But Chvrches—pronounced “churches”—are not your typical indie-pop flash in the pan, and their first full-length album, “The Bones of What You Believe,” is proof. The 12-track LP is nearly impossible to take off repeat, as any good pop album should be, but it’s also impeccably arranged and drenched in personality. “Bones” is an exceptionally confident debut and it suggests that Chvrches isn’t going anywhere but up.
 
A first impression of Chvrches’ music can be summed up with two descriptors: “massive” and “’80s.” It’s bright, anthemic, and unabashedly loud. Yet while their splattering snare drums and sparkling synth lines are obviously indebted to Reagan-era behemoths like New Order and Depeche Mode, a closer listen reveals a diverse range of influences that aren’t moored to a single time period. “We Sink” bounces along with the midrange throb of Robyn; “Science/Visions” has some of The Knife’s otherworldly menace; and “The Mother We Share” opens with chopped-up vocals reminiscent of Purity Ring. As such, Chvrches’ music could conceivably appeal to anyone who’s been a fan of dance music at any point in the last three decades.
 
Yet “Bones” isn’t a mere collage—though their influences are apparent, Chvrches sound like nobody else. Much of this is the work of lead singer Lauren Mayberry. With her airy soprano, Tumblr-ingenue good looks, and characteristic glittering eye makeup, Mayberry might seem like an ideal candidate for the manic pixie dream girl machine—but Mayberry herself begs to differ. When she gleefully sings “I’ll be a thorn in your side ‘til you die” on “We Sink,” it’s instantly clear that she’s no cooing eyelash-batter but a multifaceted songwriter with no shortage of dark sides. Sometimes, as on “Gun,” she plays the scorned and vengeful lover, singing, “Hide, I have burned your bridges / I willl be a gun / And it’s you I’ll come for.” And “Lies” reads like the jaded internal monologue of a serial manipulator who’s too good at what she does to feel guilty about it: “I can call you up if I feel alone / I can feed your dirty mind / Like I know you want.”
 
Martin Doherty also takes center stage on occasion, as on the “Recover” EP’s “ZVVL,” and while his voice is pleasant enough, it doesn’t have nearly as much presence or emotional force as Mayberry’s. “Under the Tide,” one of his two solo tracks on “Bones,” is therefore the album’s only skippable cut—Doherty’s comparatively flat delivery makes the song’s four-and-a-half-minute runtime feel much longer. His voice works much better on closing track “You Caught the Light,” a moonlit slow jam that serves as an apt comedown from the rest of the album’s furious energy.
 
Most of the singles that first gained Chvrches attention reappear on “Bones” essentially untouched. Although “Lies” and “The Mother We Share” have a little more studio polish than their original versions, they thankfully haven’t lost any of their oomph—and EP cut “Recover” and standalone single “Gun” haven’t changed at all. It’s not as if Chvrches are just lazily recycling their old material for album filler, though—these songs feel definitively like they belong on the album.
 
That might be because pretty much every new song on “Bones” would have as much success as a single as anything they’ve released so far. “Night Sky” starts out as a rather innocuous dream-pop piece, but by the end, Mayberry and co. have set fire to the whole thing in a blaze of thunderous drums and churning bass, leaving nothing but disembodied fragments of Doherty’s voice drifting through the air like embers. And the sputtering-cyborg lilt of “Lungs” carries with it a melody from Mayberry that, like every other Chvrches song, will dig itself into your auditory cortex and refuse to leave for weeks.
 
Perhaps that’s the most impressive thing about “Bones”: purely as a pop record, it’s nearly flawless. Every song is catchy, and every song feels equally suited for headphones and for stereos, for parties and for breakups, for walks to class and for road trips. The group taps into seemingly every dopamine-rush quality of dance music while refusing to pander. Don’t blink—Chvrches are headed for the stratosphere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An afternoon packed with star-studded events for Harvard’s alumni and donors kicked off the public phase of Harvard’s potentially record-breaking capital campaign on Saturday.
Former Harvard student Bill Gates, University President Drew G. Faust, campaign co-chairs, and prominent Harvard faculty members spoke in a nearly four-hour program in Memorial Church and Sanders Theatre designed to build excitement and momentum for the fundraising effort.
The events culminated with an announcement, disseminated in a press release earlier in the afternoon, that The Harvard Campaign would aim to raise a total of $6.5 billion, and that it has accrued $2.8 billion in donations and pledges so far. That announcement, made by Campaign co-chair and Harvard Corporation member Paul J. Finnegan ’75, drew a standing ovation from the several hundred alumni and supporters assembled in Sanders Theatre.
Following the unveiling of the Campaign’s monetary target, Faust took the podium to outline her aspirations for an invigorated fundraising drive.
“This afternoon I want to share with you my ambitions—ambitions for how Harvard will be enhanced and enabled by this campaign,” she said, then touching upon House renewal, development in Allston, interdisciplinary collaboration, and other campaign priorities.
Striking a motivational tone, she said later in her remarks, “[The campaign] must shine a light on why universities matter—and why the higher purposes of higher education must continue to claim a central place in our national life and its educational agenda.”
After mingling at a tent outside Memorial Church shortly before 1 p.m., hundreds of donors, alumni, and Campaign staff members gathered inside the church for a faculty panel entitled “The Future of Knowledge.” The panel featured four professors and was moderated by Jonathan L. Zittrain, a leading thinker in the field of internet law who holds appointments at the Law School, the Kennedy School, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. A brief question-and-answer session followed.
The panelists discussed a variety of challenges and opportunities in higher education, including the impact of technological advances on academia and the role of academic institutions in disseminating knowledge. As part of a segment of the discussion focused on the nature of truth in academia, a well-known clip from The Colbert Report about “truthiness” was played to the audience.
While neither Zittrain nor the panelists directly discussed The Harvard Campaign, their conversation covered many of its themes—among others, interdisciplinary collaboration and the power and limit of technology in spreading information.
Once in Sanders, investor and Campaign co-chair David M. Rubenstein interviewed Bill Gates, who attended the College for three years but did not graduate. Their conversation covered Gates’s time at Harvard, his creation of Microsoft and, later, his work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and his relationships with other business leaders, such as Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett.
Rubenstein also asked him more trivial questions, such as why users must enter the command “control-alt-delete” to start up the Windows operating system. Gates began giving a technical explanation before pausing and admitting, “it was a mistake,” prompting laughter from the crowd.
The two men discussed Gates’s legacy in the world of business, philanthropy, and even in his own family. Rubenstein asked Gates whether he would trade his success for 10 more years of life.
“For 20,” Gates joked.
Faust topped off the afternoon with a speech lasting just over 30 minutes, describing a general vision for the University and the Campaign’s place in its future.
“It is up to us to make sure that we continue to build, to lead, to advance in a world almost unimaginably different from the one our founders inhabited nearly four centuries ago,” Faust said.
Declaring that the Campaign gives Harvard a unique opportunity within higher education, she said The Harvard Campaign is essential for the University’s entrance into an “impatient future.”
“A campaign calls on us to ask what we stand for, what institutional commitment we will make to define who we are and who we will be decades and centuries from now.”
Campaign co-chair Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 wrapped up the day’s event with a short speech that expressed appreciation for Faust and Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74. O’Donnell again emphasized the importance of this “once-in-a-generation collective effort” for Harvard’s future.
Not long after the conclusion of the program, donors headed across the river on Saturday evening for a dinner in Harvard Stadium, which several of the afternoon’s speakers, including Faust, referenced while onstage.
In interviews outside Sanders Theatre, donors responded well to the launch, with many citing the concept of One Harvard—a unified, interconnected University—as a point of shared excitement.
Christine M. Pina, an alumnus of the Graduate School of Education, called the launch “fantastic” and “incredibly inspiring,” adding that she appreciated that Faust’s comments spoke to the University collectively.
Thomas M. Chappell, a graduate of the Divinity School, said that he was excited about the role of the Divinity School in the One Harvard vision and about the prospect of beating the $6.5 billion goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new series, The Crimson will look each weekend at the five best quotes of the week, providing context for the five best moments from the past seven days in Crimson sports.
“It’s been amazing. We’ve heard from generations of Radcliffe alums, other teams, other students who just stopped to say ‘good luck.’ It’s been amazing to have the whole support of the Harvard community behind us. That was a really wonderful thing for us to carry into the game.” -- Xanni Brown ‘14
Women’s rugby – Harvard’s newly added 42nd varsity sport – finally made its home debut under the lights Tuesday night at Cumnock Field. Although the Crimson found itself in a tight game for much of the first half in front of a solid crew of fans, visiting Quinnipiac pulled away in the second frame to deprive Harvard of its first win of the season.
“Coach Murphy, he’s a genius. He has a system in place where we try to match the number of games they play through scrimmages. We try to make our scrimmages game tempo, game environment…. So by the time we get to our first game we’re kind of even keeled almost, not sort of behind them in terms of conditioning or mental toughness.” -- Nnamdi Obukwelu ‘14

The Harvard football team will make a rare cross-country trip to take on the University of San Diego on Saturday. While the game will mark the season opener for the Crimson, the Toreros will have already played two full games, forcing Harvard coach Tim Murphy to simulate game conditions in practice to prepare his team for the East-West showdown.
“It was my best round that I have ever shot, certainly in a college tournament. But I also knew that there were 18 more holes to go for that day, and I was just taking it one shot at a time. I tried to do what I did in the first round for the rest of the tournament, and I certainly felt helped by the rest of the team putting up good scores.” -- Tiffany Lim ‘15
The Harvard women’s golf team placed first out of eight teams to bring back some hardware from the Princeton Women’s Invitational last weekend. Junior Tiffany Lim shot 66 in her first round, setting a course record for women and propelling her to the individual championship.
“Right from the start, we had a fast offense. That really helps us do well in these games, and I think we’ll continue to develop it and make it something that will hopefully win us the Ivy title.” – Corinne Bain ‘17
The Harvard women’s volleyball team notched its fourth win of the season against UMass Lowell on Wednesday with a clean 3-0 sweep. Bain, a setter, racked up 16 assists and nine digs. Fellow freshmen Grace Weghorst and Jane Labanowski also received significant playing time.
“[Goalkeeper Brett Conrad] was very good at organizing, and that’s a big component of keeping it out of the net. You could hear him, and [he took] a big jump forward in that respect – improved at it a lot.” -- Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer
Buoyed by solid defense, the men’s soccer team battled to a 0-0 tie against Lafayette on Sunday to earn its first points of the season. Conrad, a co-captain, registered his first shutout of the year with four saves as the Crimson defense held Lafayette to only six shots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in five years, the Harvard field hockey team came away with a win against archrival Yale. The Crimson (2-2, 1-0 Ivy) opened up Ivy League play in convincing fashion this weekend at Yale, winning 3-2 over the Bulldogs (1-4, 0-1).
Despite the close margin of victory, Harvard took control of the game for most of its duration. In the waning minutes of the game Yale mounted a late surge; but, it proved to be too little too late for the Bulldogs as the Crimson extended its winning streak to two.
“This being our first Ivy League game that we played this season, we tried to put everything on the field,” junior forward Noel Painter said. “It really paid off, and we outplayed Yale for the entire game. It was a very exciting win for us.”
Coming fresh off of a breakthrough game that included four goals against Holy Cross the previous week, Harvard’s offense did not take long to best the Yale defense. At 27:29 in the first half, Painter took advantage of sharp passing following a penalty corner to score her second goal in two games.
“The ball came down from the left side of the field to [senior forward] Bridget McGillivray [and] she took it and passed it to me,” Painter said. “I was right outside of the circle, and my shot hit off of [Yale goalie Emily Cain] and into the net.”
While the remainder of the first half passed without another goal, the Crimson kept its offensive pressure high. Several superb saves from Cain kept the game within reach for the Bulldogs despite Harvard greatly outnumbering the Bulldogs in both shots (11-7) and penalty corners (7-2).
The stalemate did not last long past the halftime break, however. Within two minutes of beginning second half play, Crimson junior forward Kaitlyn Boudah found the back of Yale’s net for her first goal of the season, extending the lead to 2-0. Once again, Harvard capitalized on a penalty corner—following two blocked shots off of the set piece play, Boudah took control of the ball and managed to send it past Cain.
In the meantime, on the other side of the field, Harvard goalie senior Jenn Hatfield effectively silenced the Bulldogs’ prolific offense, which had produced three goals on average in its first four games of the season, including a 6-0 shutout of Sacred Heart.
“I think [Hatfield] had a terrific game,” sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson said. “There were several plays where she made awesome saves.”
Hatfield notched five saves during the game and played a crucial role in keeping the momentum with the Crimson.
Thanks to Harvard’s strong defense, Yale only managed to score its first goal with fewer than 15 minutes remaining on the clock. A foul on the Crimson resulted in a penalty strike for Bulldog senior forward/midfielder Erica Borgo, which she managed to send past Hatfield to cut Harvard’s lead to one.
The Crimson immediately responded by taking advantage of a penalty corner to extend its lead. Freshman forward Sarah Finnemore made a pass to Jacobson, who then sent a shot towards the net. Freshman forward Marissa Balleza found the ball in front of the net and reflected it for a score, notching her first goal in her Harvard career.
“[Balleza] drove it in with a reverse hit,” Jacobson said.  “She took it right in; it was a really great goal for her.”
Yale scored a late comeback goal off of a penalty corner with no playing time left on the clock. Senior midfielder/back Georgia Holland managed to find the back of the net with an assist from Borgo and senior midfielder Emily Schuckert, but the Harvard win was sealed.
The team believes that Saturday’s victory will provide crucial momentum carrying on into the in-conference season.
“[Saturday’s game] was a great start to the Ivy League games,” Jacobson said.  “We tried hard all week trying new systems and focusing on playing as a team and a unit, and that’s what we managed to do. This [win] is going to help us show everyone what we can do, and hopefully we can just keep getting better as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a furious two-goal comeback in the waning minutes of regulation to force overtime, the Harvard men’s soccer team was unable to close the deal.
Hartford senior forward Peter Bernhardsson’s header into the back of the net in the 98th minute sealed the fate of the Crimson (1-4-1) in Friday night’s tilt against Hartford (5-0-2) in Connecticut. The 3-2 loss was Harvard’s fourth of the season.
Having been outshot in first period of the game, Harvard found itself down, 2-0, early in the second half. But the team was able to regroup and responded with six shots after the break.
“We [didn’t] dwell on it…[We] were ready to fight back,” senior defender Ross Friedman said. “You could see that we were going to come back before it even happened.”
Harvard’s persistence finally paid off in the 77th minute. Friedman played a free kick into the box, which sophomore midfielder Andrew Chang was able to possess and chest home for Harvard’s first goal of the game.
Minutes later, Friedman struck again. This time, he sent in Harvard’s only corner kick of the second half and connected with freshman defender Alex Leondis, who scored to knot the game up at two goals apiece in the 81st minute.
With his two assist performance on Friday, and another on Sunday, Friedman has now recorded four on the season—a team high. Both Chang and Leondis notched their first goals of the season on Friday.
“They fought for everything they got,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “Every chance they got, they earned.”
Harvard looked for its second-half momentum to carry over into the extra period but was held to a single shot in overtime before Bernhardsson’s golden goal ended the Crimson’s hopes for its first win of the season.
“They did a great job; we took a big step forward,” Lehrer said. “[But] it’s not the result we’re looking for.”
Hartford’s first two goals allowed it to jump out to a lead that was ultimately insurmountable. Senior forward Anthony Santaga opened the scoring for the Hawks with his first goal of the year in the 18th minute. He brought down a long ball in the right side of the box, pivoted, and put a half volley past Harvard co-captain goalkeeper Brett Conrad.
Hartford maintained its offensive pressure early in the second half. Conrad was able to make an initial save on a shot by Hawks’ junior defender Damion Lowe in the 53rd minute. But sophomore midfielder Anthony Lobello collected the rebound and finished to put Hartford up by two.
The Hawks’ lead would not last for long. Twenty five minutes later, Harvard netted two goals in quick succession to tie the game, 2-2.
These two goals by the Crimson were the first to pass Hawks’ freshman goalkeeper David MacKinnon all season. He had recorded four straight complete-game shutouts before his tilt against Harvard.
“I think the other team may have thought they had [the game won],” Lehrer said. “[But] we continued to fight at every transition, every moment.”
Overcoming the two-goal deficit proved to be a feat too large for the Harvard squad, and only four substitutes came off the bench for the Crimson during regulation play. With the game extending into overtime, Harvard was unable to put together another goal scoring opportunity, as the Hawks handed the Crimson its fourth loss in its first five games.
“It’s really difficult coping [with such a close] loss,” Friedman said. “But at the same time I thought we really dominated play. We created so many chances…I’m really proud of this team.”
Both Lowe and Lobello recorded their first goals of the season in Friday night’s win in Connecticut. Bernhardsson’s header in the extra period was his second goal of the season, both of which were game winners. He leads the Hawks with two goals on the season.
Freshman defenseman Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu and junior forward Hiroki Kobayashi each put a shot on net for the Crimson.
“We keep making jumps,” Lehrer said. “We keep getting better. We’re just struggling to close that door and get over the top and turn it into a victory… If we can be a little more consistent, we can get over that hump.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The newest Crimson varsity sport clinched its first victory with a shut-out against an Ivy League foe.
“Our first win as a varsity team is very special,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “This is a huge win and it’s always great to beat Yale.”
The Crimson women’s rugby team (1-1, 1-0 Ivy) came out firing from the start and never lost momentum in its 84-0 win. By halftime, Harvard had taken a 46-point lead over the Bulldogs with several breakaways from the more experienced players that ended as tries and conversions.
But the Crimson was still unsatisfied with the plays made in the first half, implementing a number of changes after the break.
“Obviously by the scoreboard we did well with scoring,” co-captain Brandy Machado said. “But we just needed to clean up some things, like working on lunging together and making more aggressive tackles.”
Fellow co-captain Xanni Brown registered the team’s first try within the first two minutes of the game, and the Crimson’s unrelenting offense added six more tries to round out the first half. But the team still felt the need to make adjustments during the brief halftime huddle.
“I thought we did some really good things on offense but we had some sloppy defense that we needed to work on, myself included,” Machado said.
After its loss Tuesday night to Quinnipiac, Harvard came into Saturday’s contest with plans for improved play.
“We came in with some very specific goals that we wanted to achieve fundamentally, and we didn’t do it in the first half,” Parker said. “The Yale team was tough and scrappy and we started to play more individually in the first half, but we made adjustments during the second half.”
The last 40 minutes showed more teamwork for the Crimson. Senior Ali Haber scored the first try of the second period, followed shortly with tries by Machado, and fellow seniors Rachel Foo and Shelby Lin. Machado led the team with five tries. Yale hardly saw the Harvard end of the field, as most of the action happened in Harvard’s attacking third.
“During the second half we refocused and got better at launching and being more aggressive in ruts and tackles, which were things we needed to work on after playing Quinnipiac,” Machado said.
Despite minor adjustments and mistakes, the overall spirit of the Harvard team was enthusiastic after the win. With the Crimson still holding a substantial lead, many rookie rugby players got to see their first minutes of playing time later in the game.
“We had a lot of brand new rookies that have never played on a rugby field before today,” Parker said. “I’m very happy and proud of them in playing in their first varsity experience on this field today against Yale, and if we keep making improvements with each game, we should see significant strides.”
“I think they did really well,” Machado said of the rookie class. “With rugby, it’s hard because you can practice all these things but you don’t really know what’s going on, and then you get thrown in the game and you still don’t know what’s going on. The fact that they were able to get in there and play today is really great.”
Adding new faces to the lineup is just one of many transitions for the Crimson as it continues to embark on its first varsity season.
“[The rookies] are acclimating to the higher standards with great enthusiasm,” Parker said. “They haven’t mastered them yet, but as you could see from the game they’re trying as hard as they can to do the things we tell them to do.”
With the team’s first victory under its belt, Harvard is ready to face its next opponents on the road this coming weekend with a few improvements in mind.
“We have some individuals that are extremely scrappy and we need to make sure that…we don’t rely on athletes that we know can break through,” Parker said. “We need to improve our teamwork and conviction to stay focused even if we are winning.”
“[We need to focus on] strong body positions, lunging together, and racing to realignment,” Machado added. “I think we can take Dartmouth, and I’m looking forward to playing Brown and Princeton as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s water polo started its conference play schedule by taking two of three away games, including an upset of No. 14 St. Francis on Sunday. In the other two games, the Crimson (4-8) beat Fordham, 15-5 and lost to Iona 18-16 in double overtime.
“Overall, the team is pumped because we beat St. Francis in their pool, which hasn’t been done in quite a while,” co-captain Jimmy Field said. “It was a good win in a lot of ways because we were coming off of a tough loss.… It was nice to rebound and regroup with the win.”
HARVARD 14, ST. FRANCIS 11
In the final game of the weekend, Harvard gave the Terriers their first loss in their home pool since 2005. Additionally, the Crimson snapped its 16-game losing streak to St. Francis that goes all the way back to 2002.
“We were just coming off the loss against Iona, knowing we could’ve won, and we really wanted to come out with a winning record after our loss,” Field said.  “We went out there and gave it our all, and worked well as a team.”
The second half was the difference maker in this contest, as Harvard, which was down by one at the end of the first, tallied six goals in the third to take a 12-10 lead. The Crimson went 2-1 in the final quarter to ultimately seal the game.
The first half of the game had a different tone, as Harvard stayed consistently one goal behind St. Francis. Though down, the Crimson managed to keep the game close, which allowed it to come on strong in the second half.
Harvard got especially strong play from sophomore Noah Harrison (5 goals, 2 steals), followed by freshmen Joey Colton and Viktor Wrobel and sophomore Blake Lee, who also chipped in with two goals apiece.
“There are definitely individuals who had played well, but what we did when we were successful is that we had great team defense and great team offense,” Field said. “On the stat sheet you’re going to have people who played statistically well, but what allowed us to do well this weekend was a team effort.”
IONA 18, HARVARD 16 (2OT)
In a game that featured seven ties and seven lead changes, Harvard ultimately faltered in the second overtime session, ceding victory to the Gaels.
Both teams scored once in the first overtime, resulting in a 16-16 tie that forced the game into the second overtime. Then, Iona’s leading scorer Jake Lloyd scored two goals, and the Gael defense smothered a 6-on-5 Crimson advantage in the final minute to seal the game.
The largest lead of the game came at the end of the first quarter by Iona, with a 5-2 advantage.
Harvard fought back hard, eventually tying the game at 12-12 at the end of the third quarter. Eventually, the Crimson took a 14-12 lead with 4:12 left, but Iona responded in strong fashion, scoring three goals in a span of a little more than one minute.
Harvard ended up tying the game with 2:50 left, and both teams remained scoreless for the rest of the final quarter.
“It was back and forth for a while; they scored at the right time,” Field said. “We just weren’t able to execute as we would have hoped in the overtime period.”
HARVARD 15, FORDHAM 5
The Crimson commanded the game against the Rams from the opening minutes of the game, gaining control of a 5-0 lead in the first quarter and never looking back.
“We just got off a strong lead, and coming off of last week, we just really wanted to come out strong,” Field said.
Harvard was led by sophomore Ben Zepfel and freshman Dan Stevens, who each scored three goals.
The team’s strong weekend pushes the Crimson’s record to 4-8 overall (2-1 in CWPA Northern) and gives them momentum for next week’s games at home against Connecticut College, Brown, and cross-town rivals MIT.
“We definitely fought hard this weekend,” Harrison said. “We knew coming in that these would be really big games for us, with where we were in the season and with how the beginning of the season went. We came in with the right mentality.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whatever junior quarterback Conner Hempel did at halftime Saturday, he should do it again next week. And the week after that.
Two quarters into the Harvard football team’s season-opening game against San Diego, Hempel had just 39 passing yards. The Crimson was up 14-13, but only one of those Harvard scores came on offense, and Hempel gained more yards with his legs than his arm on that drive.
Then the second half started, and Hempel was a different player. On the first drive of the third quarter alone, he surpassed his entire yardage total from the first half. He completed five of six passes for 75 yards, including a pass threaded to sophomore Andrew Fischer for a 10-yard touchdown. Harvard was up 21-13, and the rout was on.
On the following drive, Hempel nearly had another touchdown pass, but junior wideout Seitu Smith fumbled the ball just before crossing the goal line.
In the fourth quarter, Hempel was even better.  He led three scoring drives, all of which ended with passing touchdowns as the Crimson pulled away for a 42-20 victory.
“We know we’ve got a quarterback,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I thought that Conner, more than anything, played with a lot of poise and discipline and made plays.”
Hempel finished the game with 345 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions. The junior benefited from great protection for most of the game, but he might have been even better when forced out of the pocket. Hempel kept his eyes downfield and completed several big pass plays after rolling out.
Coming into the 2013 season, Hempel was in a quarterback battle with senior Michael Pruneau, who missed last year with a knee injury. A week into the year, Hempel appears to have ended the quarterback controversy before it could begin.
Hayes and Hodges
Murphy knew he had said it before, but it was relevant again after the game Saturday.
“If we had six Norman Hayeses they’d be both safeties, both corners, and outside linebackers,” Murphy said. “He has a tremendous knack for the game…he’s just a great football player.”
Hayes did it all Saturday. Playing near the line of scrimmage for much of the game, he tallied a team-high 12 tackles and led the team with 1.5 tackles for loss. When he dropped into coverage, he was nearly as dominant.
With 4:51 left in the game, USD took possession, down 35-20. Needing two scores, the Toreros’ odds of a comeback were low, but they were about to get a lot lower. On second and five, San Diego quarterback Mason Mills dropped back to pass. At first it looked like he had an open receiver, but Hayes made a break on the ball, reached up with one hand and brought the pass down for what amounted to a game-ending interception.
If Murphy could make a defense full of clones including six Norman Hayeses, the other five players might be junior Zach Hodges, who happens to be Hayes’ roommate.
Hodges made his presence felt early Saturday when a fumbled ball bounced his way. The junior didn’t even consider falling on the ball. Instead, he deftly scooped it up and sprinted towards the end zone, scoring Harvard’s first touchdown of the year 53 yards later.
Even though that play set the tone for the game, it might not have been his most impactful of the day.
Following Smith’s fumble through the endzone, San Diego mounted a lengthy drive, down just eight at the time. A play action pass brought the Toreros all the way down to the one yard line. On first and goal, running back Joe Ferguson was stuffed on a dive play. Upset he wasn’t rewarded a touchdown, Ferguson jumped up and down.
Then, on second down he tried to jump over the pile. Captain linebacker Joshua Boyd stood Ferguson up and knocked the ball free. Hodges was there to grab it, denying USD a chance to tie the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the second annual New England Challenge this weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (5-3) split a pair of games against local foes Northeastern (7-6) and Boston College (8-4).
After dropping a match to Northeastern on Saturday night in four sets, the team bounced back on Sunday afternoon and earned a 3-1 win over BC. Despite the loss against the Huskies, junior co-captain Kristen Casey was pleased with her team’s performance overall.
“We had a really good, challenging weekend that set us up nicely to start Ivy League play this weekend,” Casey said. “Our win against BC today was a great team win where everyone made really valuable contributions.”
HARVARD 3, BOSTON COLLEGE 1
The match against Boston College mirrored the Crimson’s previous match against Northeastern. After losing the first set 18-25, Harvard won three straight sets to claim a win against the Eagles.
“We executed a great game plan against Boston College,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We just had a lot of people doing their jobs, both offensively and defensively. We really stuck to what our system was and we found some success with that.”
After a close match on Saturday against the Huskies, the Crimson was in for a similar experience against BC. The team posted scores of 25-18 and 25-21 to win the second and third sets before earning a hard-fought win of 25-23 in the final set. The team found success in numbers, with 12 players contributing to the win.
“We have depth on our team that we haven’t necessarily had in the past which is going to make us really adaptable and allow us to make a lot of adjustments based on our opponents,” Casey said.
Weiss agreed, pointing out the importance of the adjustments made in the two matches this weekend.
“Northeastern and BC are pretty different in terms of how they run their offense and defense, so we did have to adjust to that,” Weiss said. “We made some blocking adjustments for each opponent and had some offensive strategies that are a little bit different…it worked out well.”
The Crimson jumped out to an early lead in the fourth stanza before BC tied the game at seven. Harvard then pulled away and earned a match point at 24-21. The Eagles fought back, scoring the next two points, but Harvard held off the late rally and won the match to move to 5-3 on the year.  It was the first time the Crimson has beaten BC since 2002.
“BC plays in a really good conference and they’re great competition, so we feel really good about that victory,” Casey said.
Sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace led the team with 15 kills, while junior Caroline Walters and freshman Grace Weghorst added 11 apiece.
NORTHEASTERN 3, HARVARD 1
Harvard proved unable to overcome Northeastern’s 22-game home court win streak, losing its first match of the tournament in four sets.
The match was close throughout, but a streak of six errors at the end of the fourth set proved to be the Crimson’s downfall as a 17-17 tie quickly became a 24-17 match point for the Huskies. While a kill by freshman setter Corinne Bain brought the team within six, the Crimson was unable to gain momentum and lost the set by a score of 25-18.
“Northeastern is a good team,” Casey said. “I think we wish we could get some moments back in that match Saturday night, but we played hard.”
Harvard jumped out to an early lead in the match, registering seven kills in the first set to win by a score of 25-14. But the Huskies squad came roaring back in the second. Northeastern notched 19 kills to Harvard’s seven as it raced out to an 8-2 lead and never looked back, winning by a score of 25-15.
The Crimson kept it much closer in the third and fourth frames, losing by scores of 20-25 and 18-25, respectively. Walters once again aided the team with both offensive and defensive pressure at the net. The junior led the team in both blocks and kills, registering a career-high nine blocks and adding seven kills.
While the team was unable to pull off a win, Weiss was still happy with the way the offensive systems played out overall.
“We played really well,” Weiss said. “The score doesn’t indicate it, but [the match] was close all the way up to the fourth set, so I was pleased with the way we performed there.”

Now that shopping week is over and the semester is in full swing, bloodshot eyes, large mugs of coffee, and crowds at Lamont in the wee hours of the morning are an everyday occurrence. We've made a list of the songs that will get you out of bed in the morning, to your 9 a.m. section, and through a long problem set. 
The Wake-Up:
Arguably the most important music of your day. These songs will give you the strength to potentially make it to breakfast—let’s be real though, it’s a struggle getting to the first meal of the day.
“Roar” by Katy Perry
If this doesn’t empower you, we don’t know what will. Within 45 seconds you’ll feel capable of running a marathon, and you might even have the inspiration to finally head to the MAC. Grab your hairbrush and rock out while you get ready for class. You’ll be in a good mood all day.
“Wake Me Up” by Avicii
When you feel really helpless—at your darkest hour, when the idea of getting out of bed is worse than the impending doom of your math p-set—turn to this song. It’s basically song-ception. You’ve got a country song with pretty decent lyrics that transforms into an EDM party song. It will give you that extra needed push.
“Ways to Go” by Grouplove
“[I got a little bit longer] / I got a ways to go,” Grouplove sings. Losing track of days? So are we. Your awkward, hipster dance moves will surface under the covers as you snap your fingers along to the beat.
The Walk to Class:
This day feels like it’s going to last forever. Pump yourself up while sipping your fourth cup of coffee as you pass tourists on your way to Sever.
“Pompeii” by Bastille
This song is all about picking yourself up off the floor after a rough day.  What would you do if Mt. Vesuvius erupted in the middle of your midday nap? Bastille gets it: “How am I gonna be an optimist about this?” Try to move past the little failures.
“Counting Stars” by OneRepublic
“Lately I been, I been losing sleep,” sings OneRepublic; we can all relate to that. As you tap your foot along to the catchy beat, you’ll be daydreaming about the endless possibilities of life at Harvard.
“Safe and Sound” by Capital Cities
As soon as this song comes on, you’ll be seriously jamming out. Whether walking to class or studying, you’ll be shaking your hips. Within seconds you’ll be fist pumping the air and your textbook won’t seem so boring.
The Study Break:
It’s 10 p.m. and you’ve gone to three classes, two meetings, and maybe dinner. You stop back at your room for an hour to regroup before hitting the library. Grab your blockmates, hide your textbooks, and have a ten-minute dance party.
“Burn” by Ellie Goulding
Our girl Ellie has done it again: not only has she caused you to question the range of the human voice, but her words will also resonate. You’re surrounded by amazing people all the time, and you’ll definitely sometimes feel like “We got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something / They gonna see us from outer space.”
“Wobble” by V.I.C.
Embrace the fact that you look like an idiot doing this dance. You’ll totally bond with your entryway while shaking it to this one. Thou must not judge the wobble abilities of thy neighbor.
“The Fox” by Ylvis
So this was the song of the summer in Europe, but since it only became popular in the US recently, it can technically be considered a song of the fall. You will be left perplexed and questioning your existence. Side effects: infectious happiness and a smile tattooed on your face. And yes, everyone is hoping that The Fox will play this at some point soon. Do not try to understand it, just listen to it on repeat.

By now, you have probably heard the news that the Dunkin’ Donuts on Mass. Ave will be closing on September 26. Not sure how to deal with your sudden pangs of sorrow? No problem. Flyby has put together a five-step guide to getting through your grief.
 Denial and Isolation: The sudden news will hit with you all the force of your first ‘B’ at Harvard. You will come to feel more isolated and alone than someone in a Union dorm, or even worse, the Quad.
Anger: Don’t be afraid to show up to the Dunkin’ Donuts even after its closed, bang on the window repeatedly, and in your best Matt Damon voice, yell “How do you like them apples?”
Bargaining: You will soon realize that yelling at an empty building might be a drunken cry for someone to take you to UHS and that a Starbucks drink costs its weight in gold. At which point, you will convince yourself that you really don’t need to go out for coffee every morning, and that the dining hall could suffice.
Depression: When you wake from your nap in Sanders after Ec 10 tired and alone, you begin to wonder how you can make it through the rest of the year. You start to eat less, fall behind on your ps-ets, and become a whole different person from that caffeine-driven social fiend you used to be.
Acceptance: Finally, the anguish has become unbearable, and you decide that going to any of the other three Dunkin’ Donuts right around Harvard square could work. Plus, it’s a mainstream chain, and there are literally the same exact items at every single location.

The news is important, we get it, but we can barely keep up with our Facebook and Insta accounts as is, let alone keep track of Harvard finances. For those us who are hearing the words "Capital Campaign" thown around for the first time these past few days, here's a quick and dirty guide to get you up to speed:
What happened on Saturday? Why was Bill Gates here?
 This past Saturday, with the help of administrators, professors, alumni, and a cereal box celebrity endorsement from Bill Gates, Harvard University officially kicked off its potentially record-breaking capital campaign. The goal is to raise $6.5 billion over roughly the next five years. Or rather, the University hopes to raise just $3.7 billion to add on to the meager $2.8 billion already raised, all of which will eventually be thrown, at some point in the future, into the University’s $30.7 billion milk jar. Only Bill, a Harvard dropout, can beat that kind of money.
What is the capital campaign? What is it for?
After two years of quietly pleading for money, Harvard proudly announced this effort to publically plead for money on Saturday afternoon. And let’s be real, we don't quite know exactly what it’s for: the administration vaguely mentioned that the funds raised will be used to better fund teaching and research, financial aid, “student experience,” capital improvements, and collaborations and initiatives—but what does all that mean for the actual experience of students? Where is the money going? Hopefully toward more petting zoo days by the Science Center. Isn’t $30.7 billion enough? No, never. Are we just doing this to beat out Stanford and their $6.2 billion campaign? We don’t have to—we’re  already better than them.
Who’s paying for all of this?
University President Drew G. Faust creatively manipulated her speech to mention “the future” practically every two minutes in order to lure in doe-eyed alumni into donating their pocket change—and we’re talking deep pockets—to the school. The main point of her 30-minute address? “The future requires something more” than just the best thinkers from all over the world: it requires more money.
I'm from Ghana and I want to know whether receiving a scholarship at a competitive school is easy or difficult.
Most high-ranking schools also have top-notch financial aid programs. But though many of these colleges pledge to meet 100 percent of demonstrated need,  that term can mean very different things to different schools.
Harvard,  for example, ranked first on the US News and World Report list of best value universities,  costing an average $15,486 for students on financial aid, after need-based grants are factored in.  That's about $5,000 cheaper than Columbia, which came sixth on the list,  and $10,000 cheaper than Georgetown, which ranked 24th.
What accounts for this difference? When most people hear the term "demonstrated need," they think that it means the amount of aid a student would need to receive in order to make attending school affordable. Demonstrated need, however, is actually a technical term referring to the difference between a school's sticker price and the family contribution they calculate for you. How they determine the family contribution, of course, varies from school to school. So it might be  safe to take the term "100 percent of demonstrated need" with a grain of salt,  compare the aid packages of all the school that accept you,  and remember that it is possible to appeal financial aid decisions. Here is a detailed breakdown of financial aid policies and practices, by school:
Harvard has one of the best financial aid systems in the country. Although they do not offer merit, athletic, or academic scholarships, they have an extensive need-based financial aid system. Application to the college is need-blind, and Harvard claims on its financial aid website that they meet the demonstrated financial need of every student, including international students. The idea behind this policy is that financial need should not deter potential students from a Harvard education. As previously stated, the average cost for students on financial aid is $15,486, and 59.5 percent of students receive some form of aid. Find out more.
Yale has a very similar policy to Harvard: Applications are need-blind for both domestic and international applicants. Again, there are no merit, athletic, or academic scholarships available. 54 percent of Yale students receive financial aid, and the average after-aid price is $16,205. Learn more.
Princeton's financial aid program has grown dramatically since 2001. In this time, their funding for the need-based financial aid program has grown by over 150 percent, while tuition costs have only risen 47 percent. 58.9 percent of Princeton students are receiving some sort of need-based financial aid, and Princeton explicitly states that their financial aid program also covers international students. Princeton's admissions are need-blind, and their financial aid package even takes into consideration the cost of "eating clubs." The average cost for students on financial aid is $17,614.
According to Brown's financial aid program, 46 percent of the class of 2016 received need-based scholarships. However, these scholarships included federal and state need-based scholarships as well—42 percent receive need-based aid from the college. Again, admissions is always need-blind—a policy that was introduced at Brown in 2007. For students on financial aid, Brown's average cost is $22,039.
Columbia has an office of financial aid and educational financing that works with families of students to not only apply for Columbia need-based financial aid but also for federal and state grants. They also offer student loans. Columbia is need-blind for U.S. citizens, residents, and refugees living in the U.S., as well as for transfer students. However, Columbia admissions are not need-blind for international students. 49.9 percent of students receive aid, and the average price for them is $20,435.
Cornell also has a need-based financial aid program, but though admissions is need-blind, international students only receive aid on a “limited” basis, according to their website. 47.7 percent of Cornell students receive aid, and their average cost is $21,849.
At Dartmouth, admissions is need-blind, and students who come from families with total incomes of less than $100,000 receive free tuition at the school with no loans. Financial aid at Dartmouth also extends to any Dartmouth study abroad program. 49.7 percent of Dartmouth students receive aid, and the average cost for those students is $21,587.
Penn, similar to Columbia, offers need-blind admissions to citizens and permanent residents of U.S., Canada and Mexico, but not for international students. However, those students can still apply for financial aid if they get in, though they are encouraged not to if their family can bear the cost themselves. Penn awards $6 million in need-based financial aid annually under a no-loan policy. 44.2 percent of Penn students are on financial aid, bringing the cost for them down to an average $23,552 after financial aid. Learn more.
Stanford has similar need-blind admission policies as Columbia and Penn, stating that they admit only a small number of international students with financial need annually. The average cost for students receiving aid (49.7 percent of the class) is $18,593. For more information, see here.
Caltech has need-blind admissions for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only. They also have substantial financial aid for international students. 52.4 percent of students are on financial aid, and the price for them averages out to $21,551.
Schools in the University of California system—such as UCLA and UC Berkeley—offer need-based financial aid for students who qualify. In addition, the UC system as well as individual UC campuses offer scholarships based on merit and financial need. For example, UCLA has an extensive list of scholarships available, either based on merit and financial need or based on the specific niche the student would be filling in the school—studying humanities and law, for example, qualifies students for the Angelina Ruggie Scholarship Fund. Find out more about UCLA's scholarships.
Williams has a needs-blind admissions policy for domestic applicants  only. It promises to meet all demonstrated need of domestic applicants  and guarantees no-loan financial aid packages for students whose  families make under $75,000 a year. The average cost for students after financial aid is $19,251.
Amherst, another well-respected  liberal arts school, just recently extended its needs-blind policy to  international students as well as domestic ones. While Amherst claims to  meet all demonstrated financial need and does not include loans in  their initial financial aid offers, some students do require loans to  afford tuition. The average cost for students on aid, who make up 55 percent of the student body, is $16,286.
What is the lowest score an admitted student got on the SAT?
According to The Crimson’s freshman survey for the class of 2017, the lowest self-reported SAT score for a member of Harvard's Class of 2017 was a 1660, almost 600 points below the average score of 2237. According to that same survey, the lowest self-reported high school GPA (on a 4-point scale) was a 3.0, with the average being a 3.94.
If I ask a question, will my name be public?
No! Everything is anonymous, so please feel free to ask us anything about the admissions process.

DOES NOT COMPUTE. This past week, Wellesley College unveiled its new college cost calculator, joining other prestigious establishments like Harvard University and the College Board which already have their own. The New York Times takes a closer look at Wellesley’s new calculator and at the myth that tuition-heavy colleges like Wellesley and Harvard are not feasible options for low-income students.
ADMISSIONS OFFICERS LIE! Or rather, they reported that their colleagues at other institutions falsify data for rankings. Not surprisingly, very few admitted to lying themselves.  The Inside  Higher Ed survey of 381 college admissions officers found some other  cool stuff. Did you know that 25 percent of officers would like to see optional  questions about sexual orientation on college apps?
APOCALYPSE U. So apparently the college system is on the decline? Stanford fellow Victor Davis Hanson seems to think so. Guess it’s time for the Admissions Blog to retire.
EARLY BIRD = WORM? The Admissions Blog joined the annual media frenzy around early admission applications and sat down with Anna Ivey, founder of college admissions consulting firm Ivey  Consulting, to talk about the benefits (or lack thereof) of early action  and early decision college applications.
