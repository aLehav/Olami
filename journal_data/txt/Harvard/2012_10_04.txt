After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My freshman year, I took Ec 10 along with 682 other students. This class is widely seen as an important first step in the direction of careers in finance or consulting.
The political bent of the class is clear. Taught by N. Gregory Mankiw, former chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, the class makes short work of rent control, minimum wage, subsidies, import quotas, and other restrictions on the workings of the free market.
Although Harvard offers a class titled “Economics: A Critical Approach,” ridiculed by conservative students as “Commie-nomics,” the enrollment is much smaller. The fall that I took Ec 10, this alternative class had only 55 students. Fittingly, the professor is known to bring apples from his orchard to share with his students.
In the last discussion section of my Ec 10 section class, the teaching fellow encouraged me and my fellow students to apply our newly acquired economic wisdom in the world of business. “Now go out there and do some good for America,” he said.
I was shocked by this statement. Going off to college just a couple of months after the US stock market hit its low point in the 2008 financial crisis, I was sure that financiers were deserving of blame, not praise. I thought back to photos of bankers walking out of Lehman Brothers with their personal belongings in cardboard boxes. Certainly these weren’t the people “doing some good for America.”
I was sure that the good for America was done by politicians—from the president to city councilmen and school board members, and by other public servants, including legal services lawyers, civil rights activists, and even part-time food pantry volunteers. Abroad, I thought that groups like the United Nations and the Peace Corps, not multi-national corporations, would provide the answers to economic and social problems.
Yet, one summer spent in India changed all that.
Near my apartment in New Delhi last summer were a KFC, a Domino’s Pizza, and a McDonald’s, each with a small army of delivery personnel and a sizable fleet of motorcycles. I saw how these American companies provided jobs and stimulated economic growth on the other side of the globe. In addition, domestic companies had figured out how to make substantial profits off of inexpensive products and services for local consumers. For example, the Tata Group provides everything from cell phones to a very cheap car designed for the Indian market, the Tata Nano.
It seems to me that governments and nongovernmental organizations are unwilling or unable to solve problems in the ways that businesses can. Providing comfort and food to slum dwellers in New Delhi or Mumbai is an admirable task that makes an invaluable difference in the lives of those who are served, but it won’t lead to long-term economic growth. In other words, it’s a good thing that Jamsetji Tata started a business rather than a charity.
None of this is meant to belittle public service. After all, political and economic progress can be quite slow, and while people in America and around the world are struggling, those who are fortunate enough to have been born in the world’s richest countries ought to provide support for the downtrodden with their time, effort, and money.
Furthermore, there are some areas in which business will likely never provide full solutions. Corporate social responsibility initiatives may be part of the fights for education reform, women’s rights, and an end to political corruption, but I doubt they will be sufficient. Domestic and foreign governments, NGOs, and courageous individuals must play the dominant role in tackling these challenges.
Although NGOs and businesses both have certain limitations, bankers, politicians, entrepreneurs, and elementary school teachers all have something to offer to the world. Personally, I plan to apply for post-graduation jobs with both consulting firms and NGOs, and I know that discerning the more socially valuable one will be more difficult than some may think.
Put simply, industry and service are partners in progress. Rather than disparaging and demonizing the individuals and organizations that have chosen different methods of addressing the same problems, these two groups should learn to work together for a better America, and a better world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When three members of the Russian punk-rock band “Pussy Riot” were sentenced to two-year jail stints in mid-August for “hooliganism”, human rights activists in the West jumped to their feet. Everyone from the White House and 10 Downing Street to Madonna and Yoko Ono condemned what they deemed a disproportionate sentence for a 40-second protest against Russian President Vladimir Putin during a church service. But the attitude we take on the Pussy Riot debacle is hypocritical and is one of many examples of our condescending attitude towards countries we deem less free than our own.
The categorical condemnation of the Pussy Riot controversy was the right course of action for individuals and governments of Western nations to take. But Western nations taking the moral high ground on this issue don’t have a leg to stand on, given their own limitations on freedom of speech and instances of government abuse of legal authority. Rather than just criticizing human rights violations in other countries, we should see them as an opportunity to reflect upon and amend our own limitations on human rights. Our rightful denunciation of Putin’s repression needs to be taken one step further.
Suppose that a group similar to Pussy Riot disrupted a prayer service in London’s St. Paul’s Cathedral or New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral rather than Christ The Savior Cathedral in Moscow. All three of these churches have public spaces around them where it would be perfectly legal to protest without interrupting a service within the church, which is illegal. The police forces of all three countries would most certainly arrest protestors who interrupt a church service, regardless of how worthy their message is. If you are still convinced that our state is a more benign about cracking down on protests than Russia is, think again. On December 10, 1989, the New York Police Department removed several protestors from St. Patrick’s Cathedral for disrupting a church service. The protestors were staging a “die-in” on behalf of the advocacy group ACT UP in protest of the Catholic Church’s position on AIDS. The measures taken against Pussy Riot are, in some ways, reminiscent to those taken against ACT UP—in both cases, activism held in an iconic location in protest of an issue already ignored by the government was crushed. Constant government repression of marginalized groups and radical ideas is clearly universal and is not limited to the developing world. Russia is not the only country that cracks down on “hooligans.”
In all fairness, we are lucky to have many freedoms that other people around the world do not enjoy. But the West should not feel so complacent about its own stances on freedom compared to other countries. Barack Obama gave a speech defending freedom of speech at the United Nations in light of recent protests in the Arab world against a YouTube video insulting the prophet Mohammed, while Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi’s speech defending the right to censorship in the name of religious sensitivity went largely condemned in the West. But during the 2011 riots in the United Kingdom, Parliament and the London Metropolitan Police seriously considered shutting down Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger in an attempt to prevent rioters from coordinating themselves. UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that the “free flow of information can be used for good. But it can also be used for ill. And when people are using social media for violence we need to stop them.” I see very little difference between Cameron’s and Morsi’s stances.
Similarly, in 2011, the San Francisco transit authorities preemptively shut down mobile phone services in subway stations after receiving a tip that a group would be staging a protest against the shooting of an unarmed man by the police at select subway stations. What makes this any different than former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shutting down mobile phone and internet services between January 25 and February 5, 2011, in an effort to frustrate the efforts of protestors? I do not defend the actions of dictators and those who wish to infringe upon our rights, but I refuse to defend our general naivety about our own rights violations, which allows us to have an uninformed, condescending attitude towards the rest of the world.
This is not just another plea for the improvement of civil rights in the developed world. This is a plea for us to apply our own values of freedom to ourselves in addition to our efforts to campaign for the freedom of those who live abroad. If the rest of the world can easily identify our hypocrisies, not only is our support for human rights weakened, but the values themselves lose also their appeal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a liberal arts institution, Harvard prides itself on providing its students with a broad intellectual experience, one that encompasses a wide array of disciplines and seeks to nurture a well-rounded student body. The College’s website outlines some aspects of the desired outcome of this education, among which is the goal of helping students become “more perceptive of the world around them.”
Last Thursday, this philosophy was put to practice in a novel manner. Students in Sociology 149: “Inequality, Poverty, and Wealth in Comparative Perspective” welcomed three homeless members of the Cambridge community into their classroom to speak about their experiences living on the street.
Education, clearly, does not just entail sitting in a library for hours on end studying abstract concepts and methods of analyzing problems. There is a necessary application component as well—giving concepts like homelessness a face, and solving, rather than analyzing, social problems. This is where the invitation of guest speakers into classes function as an essential piece of the liberal arts puzzle.
No matter which discipline one chooses to study, the ability to communicate effectively is undeniably one of the greatest assets an education confers. A large part of learning to communicate well results from gaining real world experience with one’s subject of study. Good communication skills are not innate and do not develop suddenly. Most importantly, effective communication comes with experiences of engaging in the exchange of ideas among varying and diverse groups of people. Keeping this in mind, a course taught on inequality and poverty should be taken to a more personal level. Students will be better served with the inclusion of real life elements—and what better element than the people who experience these inequalities?
A book may offer names and theories to concepts that have impacted or are currently affecting our world today, but often learning can be bolstered by making those concepts real through example. Firsthand accounts like those offered by the guest speakers in Sociology 149 offer more meaningful and nuanced insight into a discussion about homelessness. Through real stories presented in the voices of those who have experienced in real life what we discuss in the classroom, our own ideas become more concrete and better informed.
With this type of comprehension comes another achievement: a greater sense of social awareness. Harvard students walk past many of the faces of homelessness every day on their way to classes or to the river houses at lunchtime. Indeed, the extreme poverty of many of the people who live in Harvard Square has not been lost on Harvard students, many of whom work with various organizations on campus to help ameliorate issues of inequality. One example of this is Harvard’s student-run homeless shelter which works to meet the needs of people like those who spoke to Sociology 149.
Ultimately, a good education does not prove itself in a test, but instead in practical application and in the inexhaustible effort to continue to learn. Sociology 149’s inclusion of the homeless in its process of interactive learning helps to make this possible.  While such a strategy is obviously not feasible for every course, the principle of connecting our education to the real world is a sound one, and something of which we would like to see more.

To the Editors:
"Revolving in Mystery,” by Felix de Rosen, purports to show that religious belief is misguided and backward. Such an idea is severely flawed, however, as belief in God is actually vindicated by reason and consistent with scientific truth.
Mr. De Rosen paints an image of religion as incompatible with reason. Nothing could be further from the truth—theists have long held the powers of human reason in high esteem. In fact, believers have gone so far as to argue that the existence of God can be proven by rational arguments alone, quite apart from revelation. The cosmological argument, for example, begins from the premise that everything in the world is a contingent being, that is, a being that need not have existed and that depends for its existence on some other being. Each object is caused to exist by something outside itself, but that cause too is contingent on something else for its existence. The result is a chain of contingent beings, a chain which is itself contingent, requiring a cause for its existence. The chain can be neither infinite nor circular; ultimately, the most rational conclusion is that there is a necessary, uncaused Something behind the chain that causes everything else but did not have to. That Something, it can be fairly said, is God.
The article’s setting of science and religion against each other is also wholly unwarranted. This juxtaposition simply cannot pass historical muster, for the history of science is littered with religious people. Nicolaus Copernicus, Gregor Mendel, and Georges Lemaître, the first proponent of the big bang theory, for example, were all priests in the Catholic Church. Furthermore, the fact that the beliefs of some religious people contradict our knowledge of the natural world does not imply that religion and science are irreconcilable. I as a Catholic believe that no truth about the natural world could contradict its Creator, and I have yet to learn of any scientific fact that shows otherwise.
Those, like Mr. De Rosen, who have come to doubt or outright reject their religious convictions should realize that there is far more to back them up than divine revelation. Before they fall away from their faith completely, or at least before they deem such belief “ludicrous,” they should engage the rich intellectual tradition of bolstering faith with reason.
Sincerely,

To the Editors:
I'm writing to correct the false claim that "engineering problems" are at the "root" of the climate crisis which was published in your recent editorial, "A Bad Climate for Divestment."
As someone who graduated from Harvard with an engineering degree, I take issue with the idea that technical problems lie at the heart of climate change. A study published in 2011 by Stanford and UC-Davis engineers showed that we could supply 100% of the world's energy demand by 2030 entirely through existing safe renewable energy technologies that are already in use.
At this point, preventing the climate crisis is a question of political will—and our federal government is being held hostage by the influence of fossil fuel corporations. As an alumnus who would like to support Harvard, I cannot bring myself to donate money while I know that my money would support the corruption of our democracy and the massacre of innocent victims of climate change.

It’s that time of year again; our seasonal friend, the pumpkin, has returned in sugary form. FM scouted the Square to find the best pumpkin treats to help celebrate the joys of fall, and to get you through those crisp nights.
Petsi Pies 
Pumpkin Pecan Bun
At first glance, this pastry looks like a normal coffee cake, but a big bite reveals a center of creamy pumpkin filling specked with chopped pecans. While we would have loved to see even more of that rich, nutty filling, this treat was by far our favorite.
Price: $2.00
5 Pumpkins
Crema Cafe
Pumpkin Cheesecake
Topped off with whipped cream and a dash of cinnamon, Crema’s pumpkin cheesecake is a great alternative to the traditional pumpkin pie. The soft crust rounds out this indulgent creation.
Price: $3.75
4.5 Pumpkins
Sweet
Pumpkin Cupcake
Sweet shrinks a pumpkin into cupcake form in this pumpkin cupcake topped with cream cheese frosting and a cinnamon sugar pumpkin seed (unseen anywhere else!). Though it was a little heavy, the cream cheese frosting complemented the pumpkin base well.
Price: $3.75
4 Pumpkins
L.A. Burdick
Pumpkin Luxembourger
Burdick’s offers Luxembourgers (a.k.a. macarons) in multiple flavors. The pumpkin Luxembourger does not disappoint: a thin layer of pumpkin filling glazed between two crispy meringue layers. Although a satisfying autumnal treat, be wary of the price-size value of this dessert.
Price: $1.50
3 Pumpkins
Hi-Rise
Pumpkin Bread
While this treat may be a little light on pumpkin flavor, it juxtaposes textures well. The chewy, caramelized outside balances the cakey, crumbly inside. Located in Porter Square, Hi-Rise might just be one of the few reasons to head over to the quad.
Price: $2.75
3 Pumpkins

1. Babies and Mitt Romney: According to The New York Times, Republican PACs have a new advertising strategy: using babies to appeal to independent female voters. Ethical? Interesting? Ingenious? You decide.
2. Halloween costumes, decorations, candy, face paint…Frankenweenie? This Friday, Disney releases its latest holiday picture: a black-white-and-spooky version of a boy and his dog—directed by Tim Burton.
3. The power of painting, and more importantly, the painting of power: On September 29, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston opened a new exhibit featuring the work of Daniel Rich, who uses acrylic paint to examine the relationship between physical structures and political influence.
4. Cheating: No, not the type that involves plagiarism, the type that involves Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former politician and body builder, sometimes known as the “Governator,” appeared on the season premiere of “60 Minutes” last Sunday to discuss his new memoir and old extramarital affairs. “Terminator” marathon, anyone?
5. “Babel”: Yes, babble about Mumford & Sons’ new album.The “Princess Diaries” finally gets its happy ending.
6. Eight years after Anne Hathaway/Princess Mia dumped Duke Andrew at the alter in "The Princess Diaries 2": Royal Engagement, she finally said “I do” to fiancé Adam Shulman last Saturday.
7. Elephants—always adorable, but increasingly endangered: National Geographic just released story and a large photo spread about elephants and the ivory trade entitled “Blood Ivory.”
8. Enjoy the new iPhone iOS 6 update, if you can find it: Apple replaced Google Maps with its own “Maps” app, prompting considerable customer backlash and a letter of apology from Apple CEO Tim Cook.
9. Forget Dental School, the cavemen had it figured out millennia ago! According to The New York Times, scientists in Italy have discovered a 6,500-year-old tooth with what seems to be a beeswax filling.
10. So many tourists (and locals) that even the tourists will be complaining about the number of visitors in the square: This Sunday is Cambridge Oktoberfest, complete with the HONK parade and seven stages filled with any number of bands that you may or may not recognize.

Dear Undergraduate Council,
It’s already been over a week, and I have yet to see any real action from the Undergraduate Council. There is still no hot breakfast in my dining hall, and my parents still hate me. This lack of cage-free omelets coupled with a natural disposition to blame all of my problems on others has lead me to question the validity of your institution. What are you actually doing? Are you really working as hard as you should to achieve your promises? Is everything you told me during your campaigns, including the fact that my skirt did not make me look fat, a lie?
So to keep you, the UC, on your toes, and to see how honest you really are, I conducted a short interview with Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, a randomly chosen, newly-elected member of the Undergraduate “Council” to see what is really going on in with our so-called student government, and what is taking so long with those eggs. Biebelberg had promised to add more sustainable features to our campus, including Dyson Airblade had dryers and solar energy, but I’m pretty sure global warming is still happening. Think about the Pfoho polar bears. I hope what follows will be enlightening for our dear readers, who can come to their own conclusions about the efficiency of the U.C.:
Fifteen Minutes: How is the UC going thus far?
Brett M. Biebelberg: We’ve had one general meeting and committee meetings have started this week.
FM: What were some of your campaign promises?
BMB: I’m looking to explore safety issues that occur on campus.
FM: What action have you taken so far?
BMB: Well, um, I’ve attended the two meetings that we’ve had so far. The election results were just announced last Friday, so there hasn’t been a whole lot of time to work on that.
FM: Have you dropped out of class yet to help achieve your stances?
BMB: Have I dropped out of class?
FM: How will going to class affect your ability to get things done?
BMB: I think that my time commitment to the UC is something that I prioritized with great importance, and I don’t see how my class schedule will get in the way of that.
FM: I know you are a freshman rep, but have you done anything about hot breakfast in the upperclassmen houses?
BMB: Given the fact that I only had the pleasure of serving this position for six days, there is not much I can do about this.
So there you have it. More than a week in office and still no follow through. This is Harvard, people—we can’t be held accountable to normal peoples’ standards. I think it’s clear from the above that you guys aren’t living up to your governmental duties, and it’s well past time to put those leadership skills to use. I’ll give you until Sunday to reverse our carbon footprint. Also, the economy. Do work.
Signed,
Soon-to-be Compers of the Ed Board, FM

Generations of yore could look to carpe diem and Bach for inspration, today’s youths turn to #YOLO and boybands. Continually reinventing revered traditions, One Direction and Generation Y have done it again with “Live While We’re Young.” In the music video, a troupe of artists enact the classic bildungsroman, or coming of age story, in not one, but many, directions. A cinematic masterpiece, it fills a gaping hole in the boys-at-play niche of the music video industry.
Immediately, our protagonists are faced with one of the most disorienting moments of a young man’s life: waking up from deep slumber to face the day that lies ahead. Peering through the flaps of their communal tent, the artists emerge to find themselves in a naturalistic setting, surrounded by youths of similar disposition. Upon further exploration of their absurdist landscape, they test the boundaries of their youth as manifested in wistful looks expressing their angst (likely existential) to the soulless camera, and extolling their need to go “crazy, crazy, crazy” until they see the sun—which, of course, is already visible. Reminiscent of Icarus’s fatal flight towards the sun, these boys frolic in large bubbles as if to escape their “bubble”-gum Top 40 personas. Although they fail to float, the metaphor is not lost; they yearn to push their mortalities to the edge.
Their growth and development is contingent on their awareness of the fact that they are living in a moment of “now or never”—never again will they experience such adolescent bliss. Numerous phallic symbols (a large inflatable banana and microphone, as well as pool noodles) are handled as weapons in a battle on the quest for manhood—and also within the literal boundaries of their kiddie pool. These boys—nay, men (but probably not)—want to impart their lessons to cohorts seeking similar stimuli. They especially encourage those of the female variety to “not overthink it, just let it go,” to transcend the bounds of mortality by preserving eternal visual evidence of such liberation on one’s cell phone.  Ultimately, these boys just want to “get some”...perspective.

Dear Tom:
Thanks for reading my musings on the weather, man. You’re the best. It’s reader(s) like you that keep me going, even when times look as bleak as the sky above. Also, regarding the problem we talked about, I think it’s best that you do something about that sooner rather than later. Leaving things as they are will only make it fester. Literally, and metaphorically. But mostly literally.
Signed,Weatherman
This week in last week’s weather, prose about the weather from last week, read to the tune of a Radiohead song. It doesn’t matter which one:
Rain, stop it; you’re drunk. No, I won’t listen to your ’Nam stories anymore. The Viet Cong didn’t make everyone sad this time—you did. No, I’m not Baxter. Baxter is your other grandson—the one that goes to Yale. Why don’t you ever remember me when I visit, Rain? I thought the doctor said it wouldn’t get this bad for another few months. Why do those doctors always lie? Anyway, I brought you some flowers, did ya see ’em?
No, of course not, ’cause when the hell does Rain ever care about flowers. They were calla lilies, anyway. I put them on your kitchen windowsill. But then there was no sun this week, and you never bothered to water them, so they died. I remember when I was younger, Rain. We were younger, both of us. You were more yourself then, teaching me to play in your puddles and cleaning me up when I fell. Where have those days gone? Why do we tumble into the future, never the same person we were last week? Now your visits bring nothing but reminders of days gone by and the sickening cold and damp of the present.

Over summer I ate things I fished myself and drank water I drew up from a well. I did drawings in a sketchbook that nobody saw. I talked to a dog. I spent whole days having sex with the curtains drawn. I painted my grandmother’s toenails.
“My friend used to come over to do them.” My grandmother—we call her Mormor, or mother’s mother—explained while I worked. “But my friend—she goes about her life as a whirlwind. She is no good at painting nails.”
As a whirlwind—som en virvelvind. My grandmother’s English is refined and clunky. It’s one of at least six languages in her possession so you can’t really blame her for it. She was a diplomat’s wife. It used to be her job to make people feel comfortable, speak to them in their own tongue, know the order of the cutlery on the table, and remove an olive pip from her mouth without anybody noticing. Do it with a twirl of the fingers, she told me, and no one will know.
Still recovering from a hip replacement, she couldn’t yet leave the house, so the only eyes that saw her nails were hers and mine. Turned out even that was too much. “Don’t look, they’re so wonky and ugly!” She cried as I gently peeled her stockings away.
She is a lady who took care of her feet. Skin scrubbed, cream applied. Nails cut, filed, and painted. She’s been doing this for almost 80 years. She’s been divorced for 30, so I don’t know who’s been looking. But she’s done it anyway.
I kept it a secret from my friends that I was back in England. I decided I would rather make sure dinner was ready every evening by the time my mum got home from work and familiarize myself with the latest developments in my four-year-old sister’s vocabulary than try and catch up with people who were only going to become less and less familiar with time. And I wanted to be what my grandmother had implied—the opposite of a whirlwind.
Night after night I refused to go anywhere.
“What is it? Are you tired?” My mother—always on her feet—would ask.
“Yes,” I told her. “I haven’t slept for a year.” It was lazy and rude and incorrect as an answer. But it avoided admitting to her that I was trying to slow my life down to a stop.
My friends were teaching children in Botswana and interning at Vanity Fair. I told myself I was just trying to do the opposite. I reasoned that what I wanted was to make the least impact on the world possible.
Living in a forest in Finland for a month was a good way of doing that. My days went like this: wake up, walk into the bushes, pee, fetch water from the well, eat, walk back into the bushes, pluck mushrooms (different bushes), sit at the kitchen table and wash the earth away, chop, fry, stir, serve, eat, wash dishes, strip naked, swim, return to land and get in the boat, check crayfish traps, cook, eat, sleep. In the midst of these tasks I was thinking a lot about climate change, about living self-sufficiently, and what it would be like if I only spoke to two or three people for the whole rest of my life. Some days, I just wasn’t thinking anything at all.
These days my grandmother calls people on the phone from her apartment. She makes meals for one. She has membership to most of London’s major museums, and she goes and looks at the paintings alone.
There aren’t too many mirrors in the house in Finland, and before long I felt like nothing more than a pair of eyes just watching everything. Nothing behind them, just watching, watching, watching. That’s what I thought it would be like when I was little, when I imagined being reincarnated as a bug or a tree. It’s the same feeling you get lying on your back in the lake, that stillness above you and below you, and you just floating between.
Back when I was young, when something of mine would break—a rip in a dress, a stuffed animal torn open—my mother would always look me in the eye and say: “It doesn’t matter. It’s just a thing.”
Snapping back, my question was always the same. “What does matter, then?”
“People matter,” she’d say. “People you love.” It was an easy answer; good enough for a child, but not enough to stop the same question coming back now thatI know you can love someone and still tear them up. What does matter, if we do this to each other still? What does matter, if not the tiny things that we gather up around ourselves when we live our lives as whirlwinds?
These days, I’ve lost the comfort of believing my mother has the answer to all my questions. Now I just float, asking the stillness of the lake, listening for a reply with submerged ears.
The answers are never quite within reach. I only know that they exist somewhere in between, the tiny black brush painting carefully within the lines of my grandmother’s toenails.

Rain was good for Oxford. The endless grassy quads were at their most verdant, and students packed the local pubs to warm their fingers around mugs of hot mulled wine. When the sun came out one mid-afternoon, the wet paving stones glistened. Perfect English weather, I thought with relish when I stepped off the train and into the damp air.
I was in England partly on a family vacation, but mostly for college tours. A childhood spent in the company of Philip Pullman, E. Nesbit, J.B. Priestley, and E.M. Forster had me primed and ready for a mad love affair with Oxbridge. I couldn’t wait to hole up in a cell-like room, tearing through volumes of Milton and Spenser. I would, I thought, bike around in a flapping wool coat and penny loafers and discuss Truffaut over pints with my tutors.
The second day in Oxford I woke up with a sore throat. That night the rain gave way to snow. Big, wet flakes got caught in my hair as I walked, sniffling, back from dinner. My parents and I were staying at St Stephen’s House, an Anglican theological college within the university. Accommodations consisted of dormitory-style rooms with twin beds and icons of saints on the walls. My parents were on one floor and I on another, separated by many winding corridors.
The fever hit me suddenly as I lay in bed. I piled all of my warmest clothing on top of my body: baggy sweaters, thick ribbed tights, my winter coat. Still, I shivered. A crucifix hung on the opposite wall. It seemed in that moment that I was going to die in that little room with only a stack of guidebooks for company. Overcome with delirium, I imagined myself a nun, wasting away from the Black Death or consumption or some other ravager of storybook heroines. I was alone with my thoughts, hermit-like, just as I’d dreamed I would be in my future Oxford dorm room, and it was misery. There was no one to wipe my sweat-soaked hair back from my face and reassure me of reality. I turned over and cried into a tissue until finally, in the small hours, I fell asleep.
By the time my parents came knocking on the door the next morning bearing tea and hot buttered toast, the fever had subsided. Over the next two days, I saw the white spires of King’s College Chapel and walked into the wind along the River Cam, but I stopped picturing myself inhabiting that strange and majestic gothic landscape.
The last day of the trip, we took the train to London, where we would spend our final night at the Columbia Hotel, a knot of grand Victorian townhouses cobbled together along Hyde Park. By the time we checked in and dropped off our luggage, it was after three in the afternoon. We had an early morning flight, and so we had just a few fleeting hours to spend in London. We were all tempted to collapse into bed and sleep the evening away. Then, my father said, “Who knows when we’ll be in London again—maybe never?” We all caught fire. We would see every little bit of the city that we could before midnight.
I had made a list of the top five museums I wanted to visit, but there was no way we would have time for even two. We settled on the Victoria and Albert, partly because it was the closest to our hotel, partly because I wanted to see the costume exhibits. Alexander McQueen had died just a few weeks earlier, and I paused for a long time in front of a pearlescent gown from his “Plato’s Atlantis” collection, the last one exhibited during his lifetime. Then, suddenly, the museum was closing, and we stumbled back out into the bright of day.
One of us—probably me—suggested afternoon tea, but we didn’t know where to get it. We were turned away from Claridge’s by a maître d’ dressed twice as well as any of us, so we walked aimlessly around Mayfair for a while until we found the Dorchester. There, in a sea of potted palms, I had a cup of some flowery oolong and one too many cucumber sandwiches. Feeling indulgent, tricked by the marble columns into thinking we were more extravagant than we really are, we decided to go to the theater.
“Can you take us to the West End, please?” my mother asked the cab driver. “Anywhere in the West End.”
And so we found ourselves caught in a dense crowd on Shaftesbury Avenue, with no idea of what might be playing where or when or for what cost. In a stroke of sudden genius, my mother bought a copy of “Time Out,” which had theater listings for the week. Ibsen’s “Ghosts” was on at The Duchess, so we set off walking. None of us had a map, but we asked directions again and again until, miraculously, we found the theater just a half hour before the evening show, got tickets, and took our seats in the upper balcony. I was in such a haze of euphoria that I barely heard a word of the play.
After a post-theater dinner of roast chicken and sticky toffee pudding, we rounded a corner and were in Trafalgar Square. It was late—long past our self-imposed curfew of midnight-—but the streets were full of people: a pack of rugby fans chanting at the sky, teenage girls trying to balance in glittering high heels, tourists snapping photos of the fountains. I stopped and stared at the milling bodies, feeling, for a moment, utterly free of my own thoughts. Then my father hailed a cab, and we were hurtling through the night, back to our hotel beds.

“Gentlemen, even if one allows that he is an important writer, are we next to invite an elephant to be Professor of Zoology?”
— Harvard Slavic Professor Roman Jakobson
The scathing remark settled any dispute: Vladimir Nabokov was not to be admitted as a Harvard professor.
In 1957, McGeorge Bundy, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote to the chairmen of all the departments, asking for names of scholars they would particularly like to have on the faculty. Nabokov had spent eight years in Cambridge, from 1941 to 1948, during which he taught comparative literature at Wellesley and organized the butterfly collection at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology. Nine years after moving to teach at Cornell, Nabokov sought to return to Harvard, this time as a professor of Russian literature.
Several professors favored Nabokov’s appointment, writes Brian Boyd in “Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years,” including his friend Harry T. Levin, chair of the Department of Modern Languages. With the publication of “Lolita” two years behind him, the writer was already of great renown in both Russian and English.
But Slavic Languages and Literatures Professor Roman Jakobson—one of the stars of the department and the author of the quotation above—would not agree to it.
Nabokov and Jakobson had known each other, though not well; they had agreed to work together on the English translation of “The Song of Igor’s Campaign,” at less than 1,000 lines, a short ancient Russian epic. Their lives reveal superficial, structural similarities that were set against the ever-present backdrop of the Cold War. Their feud, though, reveals a more complex story: one strung between academic training, Russian politics, and the legitimacy of creative scholarship.
Art in a National Context
By the time he arrived at Cornell in 1948, Nabokov had spent years translating and writing commentary for “The Tale of Igor’s Campaign,” the story of the unsuccessful war waged by a prince from Kiev against Steppe marauders. Around the same time, two other Russian émigrés were working on a critical edition to the poem: Marc Szeftel, on the history faculty at Cornell, and Jakobson.
In 1949, Nabokov and Jakobson first discussed the possibility of collaborating on the definitive English edition, along with Szeftel. The project was nothing if not timely. Their proposed translation of the Igor Tale would emerge within a context of shifting Soviet ideas about the social role of art, a context all three scholars knew well.
The period following the Russian Revolution was witness to a renewed interest in the ancient Russian epic genre. According to James R. Russell, Mashtots Professor of Armenian Studies at Harvard, who taught a House seminar on Nabokov for years, such a revival can be traced to two sources. One was a remnant of 19th-century nationalism, a desire to demonstrate artistic sovereignty by turning away from the biblical tradition and towards home-grown legends.
“There was a second and, in some ways, even darker ideological impetus,” says Russell, “in the Soviet Union.”
Joseph Stalin, along with supportive members of the literary establishment, began to condemn the avant-garde art of the time: formalism, or art for art’s sake. They believed instead that art should have a practical purpose: socialist realism that would go beyond the “bourgeois” art of the 19th century. “It had to come from the people,” Russell says, “as defined by the Soviet ideology.” This meant, ultimately, the folk bards. Though long part of peasant life and embedded in oral tradition, only now were these bards championed on a political level, with recordings and publications encouraged.
In the 40s, this artistic and intellectual debate between formalism and socialist realism was more than a question for the Ivory Tower. Back in New England, such a phenomenon resonated with the Russian expat scholars in both their scholarship and personal ties.
The Writer and the Scholar
The question of how to navigate creative and national interests was especially relevant for Jakobson, who, Russell says, “was associated in a way that Nabokov refused to be with the Soviet Academy of Sciences.” He traveled to the Soviet Union several times a year for conferences and talks. To a certain extent, then, in working with Soviet scholars, he was obliged to accommodate to the Stalinist system. “
Jakobson was not even remotely a totalitarian,” says Russell. But Nabokov profoundly despised the Soviet Union and by implication was suspicious of anyone even remotely involved with it. He himself had severed all ties.
Some scholars point to this to explain the enduring antipathy between Nabokov and Jakobson. In a letter dated April 14, 1957, quoted in Boyd, Nabokov wrote: “After a careful examination of conscience, I have come to the conclusion that I cannot collaborate with you in the proposed English-language edition of [the Igor Tale]. Frankly, I am unable to stomach your little trips to totalitarian countries.” For many scholars, such ideological differences account for their feud; for others, a certain level of bitterness plays an equal role.
In fact, says Russell, “I think they never really understood each other.” There are surface-level parallels between Nabokov and Jakobson: both Russian academics, both living in the States, after both being forced to flee. The two came from well-to-do families, though Nabokov’s aristocratic, Anglophone upbringing would more explicitly shape his novels.
But the two approached academia from vastly different angles. Jakobson had been involved with an intellectual milieu of structuralists since before his emigration. When Nabokov sought to join Harvard’s faculty, Jakobson instead wanted someone with a doctorate, with a more rigorous training in the academy. Nabokov had studied ancient Russian literature at Cambridge—prompting his initial interest in the Igor Tale—but teaching, for him, provided mainly a necessary financial supplement to his creative work. Only the success of “Lolita” would eliminate this burden. As Russell puts it, “as soon as he could leave academia he was out like a shot.”
Following the incident at Harvard, Nabokov withdrew from working on the joint edition. He requested Jakobson no longer make use of his own mimeographs, short translated segments of the Igor Tale, in his classes. In 1960, Nabokov published his own version of the work—with no mention of either Jakobson or Szeftel in the notes. For the rest of his life, he lived in Switzerland off the proceeds from his novels.
Fueds and the Academy
In a university climate, where the pearly gates of tenure vindicate muddier tactics of ascent, one wonders if such professorial feuds are to be expected. Russell, for one, doubts that a verbal battle so incendiary could take place today. “I think that people are just as vicious as they’ve always been in academia,” he says. “There’s no doubt at all of that.”
“But,” he continues, “there’s a lot less that one is allowed to say.” A standard of political correctness—instated partly to defend against sexism and racism, for example—has unwittingly produced an academic culture of perhaps greater conformity than in the past.
Even 50 years ago, Nabokov found subtle ways to slip jokes about academia into his creative works. In his novel “Pnin,” a Russian émigré professor at an American university is denied tenure; as Russell relates, it ends with the protagonist—Pnin—driving off into the sunset, unconcerned with his reputation at the academy. In “Pale Fire,” published five years later, a single footnote mentions Professor Pnin, head of the Slavic Department at Wordsmith University, who has become a stodgy old professor. An allusion to Jakobson, a comment on academia, or no more than a literary whim? Perhaps none, perhaps all. According to Russell, “that’s what literature can do.”

Rauan Kenzhekhanuly, a former fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, has transformed the Kazakh language version of Wikipedia from a site with just four active editors and 7,000 articles to a thriving community of 250 editors monitoring 170,000 entries. Next up for Kenzhekhanuly’s Kazakhstan-based WikiBilim Foundation: Kazakh Google Translate. FM rung up Kazakhstan on Skype to talk about post-Soviet pride, Internet trolls, and whether Harvard profs ought to consider Wikipedia a credible source already.
1. Tell me how you first encountered Wikipedia and what made it important to you.
As a fellow at the fellows program at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard...I took courses at the Kennedy School and among them there was a course…all about new media, Wikipedia, and all this technology, journalism, public service, et cetera. So during that course we had an assignment to write an article for Wikipedia.... So getting acquainted with Wikipedia, with the so-called Wikimedia engine, and then I checked out how much articles we have in Kazakh language and people we have in the community who actually are continuing to develop Kazakh language Wikipedia. And I found out there are just 7,000 articles and four people who are continuing to edit articles on a regular basis.
2. And what made it so important to you to expand Wikipedia in Kazakh?
I went to the list of languages in Wikipedia to see how many languages are there and what they do. And that was a shock that there are 170 languages and as a matter of fact Kazakh language was at 127th place in the list. Then I read somewhere that actually this is an indicator of the wellbeing of the language…. When I come back, I discussed it with friends, and we decided to found WikiBilim Foundation. Bilim means knowledge….
Right now we are working for one and a half years. Our mission is to develop Kazakh language content in the internet, so we started with the Kazakh Wikipedia project. We approached the national encyclopedia, which is run by the government. We have a 10-volume pretty good encyclopedia. We convinced them that the whole Kazakh national encyclopedia should be online for free…. We organized a community to upload the encyclopedia into Wikipedia. It gave us something around 40,000 articles....
Our mission is to create community…to be able to run it without any support from any foundation or government….  I mentioned that there were only four people doing it at the beginning, and now we have around 250 people do it on a regular basis.
How many people work for your foundation?
Twenty-five people full-time.
3. And when you come in to work in the morning, your job is to boost the number of Wikipedia articles in Kazakh. What do you do on a typical day of work?
We are planning training sessions or presentations and then our people just go to the university campuses or institutions or to the scientific centers and explain what it is, how we should work together…. WikiBilim is not just Wikipedia. Actually I think we are headed to the end of this Kazakh Wikipedia project as a project…. We have around 170,000 articles.
Wow. So you’re well beyond the number that was in the national encyclopedia.
The national encyclopedia told us, you know what, we see that the community is really good and the articles are not bad, and they considered actually to use Kazakh Wikipedia to be in the next edition of the encyclopedia.
4. When you first started, did you have a goal for the number of articles you wanted to reach in Kazakh before you would consider the project a success?
Yes. We started the project last year, and it was 20th anniversary of independence of Kazakhstan. Since we were approaching the government, we came up with this idea of 200,000 articles and convincing them that it was going to be our present for the 20th anniversary of the country.... We are almost there….
Our next project is to add Kazakh language into Google Translate service…. There are 64 languages in Google Translate service…. We approached the Google Translate team and they explained how to do it…but again, it depends on community…. Google Translate, you have to upload huge amount of translated materials—I mean texts from English to Kazakh or from Kazakh to English. It’s really huge work.
5. Do you think that Harvard professors should let their students cite Wikipedia in their research as a source?
It’s hard to say that. I still don’t believe that Wikipedia should be considered as a source to, you know, cite in academic works. But at the same time, many tests reveal that the reliability of articles in Wikipedia is pretty strong.... Use it as a source to check out information. But when it comes to citing, it’s difficult to say.
6. Do you write Wikipedia articles yourself, and if so, what are they about?
The article about Harvard University in Kazakh was mine.
7. Do you think Wikipedia is accurate more or less often than traditional encyclopedias?
It is difficult to say that it’s accurate, but it is just bigger. It’s more comprehensive. And it’s updated all the time. So if you have the national encyclopedia or the regular encyclopedia, the best you can do is publish it every year, which is expensive, right? … The greatest thing about Wikipedia is that you can update it all the time. For example, during this last Olympics, how fast people were updating or creating articles about champions. Actually newspapers were taking information from Kazakh Wikipedia to write about the Olympic Games and about champions and events. What they did and where they came from or how they got to the Olympic Games, et cetera.
8. So what made this matter to you? What made it your cause?
All of the activities were driven by the mission to develop our mother tongue. You know that Kazakhstan…was a part of the Soviet Union. And at that time the mother tongue in this country and in other countries in the region, they were not developed. They did not add much to the development of the language. And now the last two decades, we are trying to revitalize the language and to give a second glance to the language. And I really believe that’s the power of online and all this. Crowdsourcing projects like Wikipedia or Google Translate can help this mission, and it can be done by people.
9. Is the language threatened? Are fewer people speaking it?
It’s not among languages that are in danger or something. But the country, we are a bilingual society. By constitution we have one state language, which is Kazakh, and an additional language, which is Russian. If you go online, it’s quite difficult to find much information in Kazakh. In a way, people try to use their mother tongue for education, for professional life, et cetera. But since there is a lack of contemporary or up-to-date information in your own language, you should go to other languages, Russian language or English. And I feel that we are kind of pushing people from the circle of their own language and pushing them to another language environment. Once they leave their own language environment for Russian or for English, it’s very difficult to come back. And that is why sometimes with children, the Kazakh language is more, let’s say, home usage, right? People use the tongue, but when you go for professional information or for higher education, for science, it’s not enough.
So this is really a matter of national pride? Of having an independent national language?
It’s not enough to speak just at home. There should be writing. There should be business…. This is our mission as a foundation.
10. Well, I have one final question for you. In Kazakhstan, do you have Wikipedia races?
[Editor’s Note: Tragically, the weak Skype connection between 14 Plympton Street and Kazakhstan gave out altogether as soon as this question was asked. His answer? The world may never know.]

Inspired by San Francisco Magazine, FM set out to find some of the most stylish students on campus. Staff writer Grace Sun started with Ava C. Carter ’13, who makes classic pieces pop with funky accessories. Then, she asked Carter to name her Best Dressed Friend (BDF) on campus. And that friend named another friend, and that friend, another, until Mt. Auburn was a runway swarming with style.

On May 2, YouTube user “EdXOnline” uploaded a video entitled “edX: The Future of Online Education is Now.” The video, a two and a half minute trailer for the $60 million open source online education platform jointly overseen by Harvard and MIT, hit over 150,000 views within weeks. In the video’s opening statement, L. Rafael Reif, President (then Provost) of MIT describes the project in these terms: “so novel,” “so new,” “so different,”“very exciting,” “very scary,” and “potentially disruptive.” Behind these comments, instrumental music plays—the kind you would expect to inspire a younger generation, and more non-profit anthem than superhero theme song.
The possibly disruptive implications of edX have been of particular interest to media outlets and educational commentators, inspiring evocative headlines like“Online Classes Cut Costs, But Do They Dilute Brands?”(NPR) and “Will edX Put Harvard and MIT Out of Business?” (Forbes). In the five months between the announcement of edX and the launch of the first-ever HarvardX courses in October (CS50x: “Introduction to Computer Science,” and PH207x: “Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical & Public Heath Research”), the term “MOOC” (massive open online courses) has gained traction in the media and blogosphere. Speculation about whether MOOC-generated textbook sales might provide a vital boost to publishers has occurred alongside philosophical debates over the merits of the traditional four year university.
The edX initiative stands to join the ranks of major MOOCs like Coursera and Udacity. Like its competitors, edX intends to make knowledge available to more people. But unlike these, edX is a not-for-profit, designed with the hopes of acquiring and employing data and research about effective teaching and learning methods. Students of edX will split their class time between watching short lecture modules (around 10 minutes or so in length), performing interactive activities, and asking questions to each other and TFs in online forums.
With the combined prestige of MIT, Harvard, and UC Berkeley, which joined the edX initiative in July, edX will likely have little difficulty attracting students from around the world. Proving that these courses can overcome existing limitations of online education, however, will be a defining challenge. Preserving the prestige and branding of Harvard and MIT will also be a major concern, in addition to figuring out how to prove that HarvardX and MITx are more than just online spinoffs of their on-campus counterparts. “This is not to be construed as MIT Lite or Harvard Lite,” Reif says; whether or not these edX programs will live up to the hype, however, has yet to be seen.
LITE, NOT ENLIGHTENED
There is a pervasive, even unsettling optimism associated with the concept of open-source knowledge. It is an unexpected optimism, the kind of overflowing exuberance and youthful naivete that 20-somethings espouse in TED talks and the like—the kind that causes the worldly middle-aged to roll their eyes. And it is unexpected because it’s this older generation that is the face of this new optimism at edX, not the young firebrands of the post-Internet Explorer age.
“This is the single biggest change in education since the printing press,” says edX President and MIT professor Anant Agarwal in the aforementioned YouTube video promoting the new platform. “Our goal is to educate a billion people around the world.” These might be the words of a publicist or a speechwriter; and yet they might also be the sentiments of those who are deeply, sincerely hopeful about the progress of education.
It’s an attitude that we’ve seen before, albeit a couple hundred years ago. “One cannot go too far in making the means of acquiring an education as easy as possible,” wrote Jean-Baptiste le Rond d’Alembert, who, along with Denis Diderot, edited the “Encyclopédie,” a 1751 Enlightenment text that tried to encompass all of human knowledge in order to make it more accessible for more of the public. The 17th and 18th century European intellectual movement might in some ways be seen as a precedent to today’s emerging digital Enlightenment, not least in their epic ambitions.
James T. Engell ’73, an English professor who will teach a General Education course on Enlightenment thought in the spring, notes that Enlightenment thinkers participated in a top-down system of education from the smaller elite to the average citizen, contributing significantly to the dissemination of knowledge. The same structure could be said to apply to edX. “Although the Enlightenment was in a significant way led by people we would call intellectuals who had a high degree of education for the most part, many of them advocated a spread of knowledge to every person possible, and they advocated increased literacy.”
Both then as today, there was the seemingly unlikely confluence of elite support for an ostensibly populist sentiment—one that also found its way into the rise of a fledgling nation of the late Enlightenment: the United States.“George Washington wanted to establish a national university. It was never done, but it was his wish,” says Engell. “His farewell address also contains an interesting section on the need for the diffusion of public knowledge and education...It’s one of the reasons why I think America was able to come into being.” As the first American university, perhaps it’s fitting that Harvard will be a part of realizing and extending Washington’s dream on a greater scale than ever before—creating an internationally accessible university that doesn’t just aggregate information, but innovates in the field of online learning.
Over two centuries later, the pace and scope of progress is rapidly increasing. “I think that what’s happening now is somewhat different in the sense that things that are on the internet are—in general, not always—free for anyone who can access the internet,” says Engell. “Therefore, if you open things up in that manner, anybody in the world is an audience.”
IN REAL TIME
Monika A. Lutz, who will graduate from the Extension School in November 2015, is one of the most passionate members of this audience, the success story of the student who takes advantage of the opportunities of online education—an exception, perhaps. Lutz has completed a semester’s worth of credits, but she first stepped onto the Harvard campus this fall: Over the past two years, Lutz took four online courses from Shanghai, Singapore, and Washington, D.C.
While abroad, Lutz was one of the Harvard Extension School’s nearly 5,000 students who can choose from over 200 online courses, plugging herself into an academic community via the internet. For Lutz, taking courses remotely provided for an even more productive education. Gushing about her “real-time” education, Lutz’s rapid-fire speech matches the pace of the internet generation to which she belongs.
“It’s just-in-time education, just-in-time information; I’m learning what I need to know and immediately applying it.” These distance classes allowed her to explore options, says Lutz, who held internships at Congress, the EU Delegation to the United States, an international pharmaceutical marketing firm, and with a fashion designer during her gap years. Because of this, she knows the concentration she wants to pursue: Government, with a double secondary in Mandarin and International Business.
Lutz is emblematic of the culture of lifelong learning that edX hopes to foster. Though the courses she took weren’t strictly MOOCs—Extension School students must be accepted in order to enroll—the outcome of these online courses is similar: blurring the line between where student life ends and a professional life begins. “It really encourages lifelong learning, because you’re balancing education and your personal life,” says Lutz.
Lutz does, momentarily, acknowledge the inherent limits of the online experience. “When I was abroad, people asked me, ‘What about the college experience? Where’s the drinking and the fraternity parties and the hanging around until 2 a.m. in the morning?’” she says. “And, yeah, I missed that....” She pauses, weighing her benefits. “But it’s fine.”
Not everyone, though, buys into the hype.
HarvardX might not provide a concrete answer to the question of whether online education is the best way to learn, but Faculty Director Robert A. Lue stresses that the initiative is aimed towards rethinking the most effective ways to learn and teach. HarvardX, Harvard’s branch of the edX platform (which also supports UC Berkeley and MIT), is designing classes that demand active participation and pointedly break away from the recorded-lecture model.
Unlike the MOOCs that precede it, HarvardX is a fundamentally creative venture, says Lue. He stresses that HarvardX will be beneficial not only for distant students, but for its on-campus community as well. “It’s not about just putting courses online, it’s about how we use technology delivered via the internet to be more effective—using tutorials and videos to teach on campus as well,” he says.
Lue emphasizes that this close evaluation of the learning process is what makes HarvardX’s approach to online education unique. “Platforms [like Udacity or Coursera] don’t really think about how it comes back to their campuses, but we are both external and deeply internal.“ Lue cites the potential for personalization and flexibility within HarvardX courses. “We’re really in a research-based, cyclical process....It’s a broader impact on higher education,” he says.
HarvardX, he explains, is not concerned simply with delivering pre-recorded course content en masse. “How do students in Bangladesh and Rio respond to and interact with the content?” he asks. “We can assess this really beautifully, and that can give faculty a crisp evaluation of whether that’s the best way to do this.”
BEYOND THE YARD
When HarvardX launches in less than two weeks, it will explore the advantages of online education with students around the world. However, the College is already experimenting with online education for undergraduates on-campus. Professor Ali S. Asani ’77, chair of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, is teaching a General Education course this semester called Culture and Belief 19: “Understanding Islam and Contemporary Muslim Societies”; Asani has taught this course in four previous iterations, but this time, he has added online-only sections that change the dynamic of discussions.
“If you look at the profile of online students, they’re not the typical Harvard student: There are business people in there, there’s a fighter pilot from Afghanistan who works for the US Air Force there, there’s a housewife from Abu Dhabi, two people from South America, somebody from Calgary, somebody from Vancouver. It is a really diverse kind of a group,” says Asani.
This is the first time that a General Education course offered at the College has offered online sections, according to Asani, who feels that this course, because of its focus on international societies, is particularly benefited by online sections. Although Asani felt strongly that these sections would enrich the course, members of the administration were initially hesitant.
“I had to struggle to get approval for this. People were wondering about its impact; there was a great deal of caution about whether the College would appreciate this,” Asani says. Thus far, Asani has been optimistic about online sections and has received positive feedback from teaching fellows who led the first sections of the course in September. Using video conferencing technology, the sections function largely like on-campus sections.
In fact, Asani argues that online sections have certain technical advantages over their in-person counterparts. He gives the example of breaking sections into smaller discussion groups during class: With the click of a button, he can sort students into groups and allow them to discuss in private virtual classrooms, without the shuffling chairs or distracting white noise generated by neighboring groups’ discussion.
Sometimes, however, the opposite occurs: In D.C., Lutz had the misfortune of taking a proctored midterm for her sustainable development class at a local high school the day before its homecoming. “I’m trying to write a two-page paper, and outside the window, next to me, is all these band tunes, the music man is practicing and banging on his drums. Are you kidding me? Today of all days?”
Although there are clear benefits to diversity in the classroom, the limited student response to online sections suggests that this experiment is still only an experiment, and that students are not quick to embrace changes to the traditional, cloistered undergraduate section.
Contrary to Asani’s expectations, the majority of undergraduates opted for on-campus section when offered the opportunity to take section online.
“To be frank, for most undergraduates this idea was so new to them....They don’t know what [online education] is about, even though I explained it to them, because they’ve never experienced it.”
The novelty of online sections might account in part for the subdued student response, but another underlying reason may have todo with Harvard’s elite image, which could be seen as being threatened by the expansion of sections to non-undergrads. Harvard admissions literature frames the discussion section as a special partof the Harvard experience, but is it as special when seen through a computer screen?
“Harvard’s challenge and MIT’s challenge is going to be to maintain the elite brand at the same time that they massify—that’s what the ‘X’ does, which is say that this is Harvard and not Harvard,”says P. Marc Bousquet, an English professor at Emory University and a contributor to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Maintaining brand prestige is an unavoidable topic when discussing how Harvard operates, but here it’s an especially complicated one because of the conflicting pedagogical and financial considerations at play.
Ben Gaucherin, Chief Information Officer at the Law School and a technical adviser to the team that is implementing HarvardX and has worked with MIT leadership, notes that the internal response to MIT’s turn toward online courses—their OpenCourseWare began a decade ago—was initially lukewarm. In retrospect, however, putting the body of MIT’s coursework online stands as an important addition to MIT’s status and role as aninstitution of higher education: “And at the same time, you don’t see MIT going anywhere, you don’t see their name tarnished.”
Down the river, the breaching of the line separating Harvard from the outside world might be unsettling for students, when the exclusivity of a Harvard education is no longer bounded by the gates to the Yard.
“[Online students] are working people, professionals who are motivated or in some cases even more motivated than undergraduates, going out of their way to take these courses. It’s not on their doorstep, as it were,” says Asani.
Employers might soon be seeing HarvardX and MITx on the resumés of these students and professionals, and the YouTube comments for the edX promotional video reflect a growing interest in the practical benefits of universal access to higher learning: “the question remains, will the world take you seriously if you use this....” (DeathlyPudding), “is it possible to get a job with the mitx certificate?” (Gh0StSecurity). The most interesting question, however, might not have to do with the logistics of such a project taking off, but with something more fundamental to the enterprise of open access information, which user “tpzlol” questioned: “What kind of person would dislike this?”
DIGITAL HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS
“There’s a massive disjunct between the rhetoric of democracy and open access and the actuality of multiple tiers of service,” says Bousquet. He argues that today’s open access movement presents an idealized—even airbrushed—image. Improving the quality and scope of education are two primary missions of projects like edX, but Bousquet notes that when speaking about education in such broad terms, “You really have to put ‘quality’ in quotation marks.”
According to Bousquet, the model of edX reflects current trends which apply business organizational models in order to increase the scale of open access education. This in turn can be traced back to the educational policy decisions of U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86.
“Arne Duncan and the partnership [between HBS and HGSE] is overtly and unapologetically committed to trying to use methods from corporate America, including downsizing and outsourcing and so on, to scale up and reduce costs and increase their version of quality,” Bousquet says.
“When Arne Duncan says ‘quality,’ he’s referring to the business school or the business theory or the administrative discourse of‘quality,’ which means quality in tiers.” Seen one way, this business model of education provides a diversity of options for students of different means and backgrounds, but Bousquet identifies a less optimistic perspective wherein edX might reinforce stratifications according to social class: “You actually have a classing of society on a corporate business school model.”
Bousquet also points out that edX does indeed have multiple missions, and that attention from the media on the “democratization of knowledge” might inadvertently cause the general public to overlook these other goals.
“Most people focus on the accumulation goal: ‘Coursera is trying to make a profit, so Harvard, Berkeley, and MIT must be more noble because they’re giving courses away for free.’ To an extent this is true,” says Bousquet. “But Harvard has another mission, certainly: to use these courses as a laboratory in relationship to its other initiatives, like the PELP [Public Education Leadership Project]. It’s going to support people like Arne Duncan and for-profit charter operators in massifying K-12 education.”
There is no free lunch, Bousquet’s statement suggests, and the price of admission for access is not just the cost of connecting to the internet, but also permission for Harvard to use participants as educational guinea pigs. Bousquet notes that although edX will have advantages from its nonprofit model, it will have to more persuasively address where HarvardX stands in relation to Harvard, and MITx to MIT.
Lue, however, stresses the faculty’s commitment to keeping these HarvardX courses top-notch. “The content will be there, but can we give students the experience of going to brain break in the dining hall of Kirkland House? Probably not,” he says.
Both recognize that the online experience is a trade-off. “But to complain that it’s not fully democratic—we’re certainly less democratic now [than we will be with HarvardX]. And we’re far closer to being democratic than we ever have been before,” Lue says.
“The best part of this model is the claim of open access and the degree to which it actually accomplishes it,” Bousquet acknowledges. “The biggest downside is the extent to which that claim is either untrue or masks real differences: meaning, the difference between Harvard experience and the HarvardX experience.”
“There always is some gap between the rhetoric of democracy expressed in ideal terms and its actuality,” says Engell. “It’s a process,and there’s truth to the phrase ‘the digital divide’—between the digital haves and the digital have-nots—but that divide has been narrowing.”
THE X FACTOR
Professor Marcello Pagano, who teaches at Harvard’s Schoolof Public Health, says that, in a way, he’s been preparing to teach his first edX course for 10 to 15 years. He sees this class as a natural continuation of his teaching career, and Harvard and HarvardX as complementary but not competing. “What’s happened now is that it’s sort of perfect storm,” he says.
Pagano’s course, PH207x: “Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical & Public Health Research,” co-taught with Earl F. Cook, a professor of epidemiology, will cover “the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research,” according to the edX website. Classes run from Oct. 15 to Jan. 18, and the “estimated effort” involved is listed as 10 hours per week. “A sound grasp of algebra” is the only prerequisite.
The edX technology, Pagano explains, allows each student to have total control of the speed of every segment. Students will be able to pause, rewind, replay, even play the segment at up to 1.5 times the original speed. “You don’t sound like a chipmunk—it’s not a fast forward—but it’s at a faster speed so you can knock off a third of the time. You’ve got a lot of control over the delivery of the material,” Pagano says.
“What these HarvardX tools will allow us to do on campus are spend more meaningful time doing the things that are dependent on face-time,” says Lue. He cites the “flipped classroom” theory, sometimes called “reverse teaching,” in which this new technology allows students to learn and process information by themselves from a pre-recorded lecture, and then use class time applying this understanding in the presence of their teacher.
But what of this personal aspect, the lost dimension of face-to-face interaction over edX? “If you’d asked me that 10 years ago, I might have answered differently. But how do you interact with your friends?” Pagano asks. “Do you text? With today’s generation, there’s much more electronic communication.”
Pagano points to the many ways that connections are formed over distances. “Surely you’ve heard a song by your favorite artist,and you’ve felt, ‘Oh, she’s talking to me,’ and that hits you right in your heart—that’s what we have to do,” he says. “I’m not Adele, but....We’re really guiding the students to do their own work, to help with their own teaching—the distance and all that, that’s all incidental.”
According to Lutz, face-time isn’t always as valuable as it’s made out to be. “You know, how many of my classmates sat there in class last night and didn’t ask a single question—while the students online were sending their questions in, and the professor knows them through that?” Since arriving on campus, Lutz has met all of her former professors in person, and has had many say they recognized her and remembered the questions she posed online.
Yet, Lutz’s efforts to meet her professors indicate the inherent value of personal contact.
“I subscribe to a notion that online education is not going to replace what happens here,” Lue says. “Your interactions with students, faculty, even grad students, that’s all really special to Harvard based on ‘here.’ And I see edX as a wonderful enhancement to what’s here. Is this the end of the brick-and-mortar university? I say hell no.”
FUTUREx
Online learning, then, leads to a counterintuitive outcome: Maybe a remote education can sometimes be a more personalized one. EdX, Pagano suggests, could replicate the one-on-one teaching experience, but on a massive, previously unfeasible scale.
In a classroom of 100 students, he explains, teachers are limited because they can’t possibly pace material at a speed that’s appropriate for everyone, nor can they pay personal attention to students. And in Pagano’s perspective, even though HarvardX will focus on learning outside of Harvard’s Ivory Tower, “If done well, it will have a lot more active learning.”
In contrast to Lue’s consideration of HarvardX’s impact on the immediate campus community, Pagano also focuses on its potential for far-reaching influence. He speaks of plans he’s developing with a former Rwandan student and teaching fellow to broadcast HarvardX courses in Rwanda and develop a program whereby students could attend sections with a teacher to receive credit at local universities there. Elsewhere, edX has already begun to draw out the most promising thinkers of the next generation of students.
Pagano cites an example of a student who received 100 percenton all of the assignments in the prototype edX course, MITx6.002x: “Circuits & Electronics.” He was a 15-year-old student from Nepal.
Although edX is still a work in progress, the media attention it has drawn to itself and other MOOCs have attuned students and faculty members to the elements that differentiate their on-campus education from online education, as well as the possibilities of incorporating online education into the on-campus experience. Commentators will continue to debate the relative merits and demerits of both, but, in a way, the two might ultimately be apples and oranges. For all the excitement that Pagano shows for the upcoming launch, he still appreciates certain aspects of the traditional in-person model.
“It’s kind of like a play versus a movie. We’ve created a movie. What we’ve got here, on campus, is the play,” he says. “One day I might not feel so good, I’ll forget to do some things—the quality of the play isn’t always as good as the movie, but it has some intimacies and immediacies that the movie doesn’t have.”
In two weeks, edX launches at Harvard. As it stands, the experimental initiative has generated more questions than it has answered, but as D’Alembert wrote in his “Preliminary Discourse” to the “Encyclopédie,” there may be some questions that education can never completely answer; instead, consolation might come from information tangibly acquired: “As a matter of fact, if a great amount of pleasant knowledge was sufficient to console us for not possessing a certain useful fact or principle, then we could say that when the study of Nature refused us the requisite information, at least it abundantly provided us with pleasure, like some sort of superfluity that makes up, although rather imperfectly, for what we lack.”
Although it remains to be seen what edX will become, there is one question whose answer is known: What does that X stand for? As Lue explains in an email, it stands for many things: “The X does not have a single official meaning, rather it simultaneously connotes several qualities that we associate with HarvardX—excellence, external outreach, exploration, experimentation, expansion. And, as you pointed out, it also distinguishes the effort. I hope this helps.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 4, 2012, at 3:16 p.m.
The MacArthur Foundation announced Monday that Harvard economics professor Raj Chetty ’00 has been awarded a 2012 “genius grant” of $500,000 to explore creative passions and to pursue meaningful scholarship.
Chetty, whose work as a public economist focuses on equality of opportunity across the United States, said that he was “very surprised” to hear he had won the award, “because this is not an award that you can apply for.”
Chetty is one of 23 innovators to win this year’s batch of MacArthur Grants—commonly referred to as “genius grants”—which provide its recipients with a no-strings-attached award of $500,000 and guidance over the next five years for academic and professional pursuits.
Chetty said that he was “very excited and happy for the department” to hear that he had been awarded a MacArthur Grant. He said that he originally received the telephone call while having lunch with his mother in downtown Boston.
A public economist, Chetty’s work focuses on issues ranging from sales tax to teacher effectiveness. His research has included nuancing the economic assumptions of optimization, focusing on how people respond to tax changes. Chetty said that he is currently focusing on issues of equality.
“This type of award will allow me to focus more directly on that,” Chetty said. “I am hoping [the MacArthur Foundation] will give me more flexibility and time for a research group to work on really big projects.”
Students who have worked with Chetty said they were excited to hear that he had been chosen for the award.
“He’s unique because he’s very serious about economic theory, but also very serious about the real word and empirical stuff, and he combines the two of them in a very powerful way that I think sets him apart,” said Ph.D. student Adam M. Guren ’08, who is a former Crimson editor.
Chetty received tenure from the University at the age of 29, a mere eight years after graduating from the College summa cum laude.
Chetty seeks transparent answers to the questions that he works with, rather than “hiding behind abstract [math],” said Ph.D. student Peter N. Ganong ’09, an advisee of Chetty’s. “He emphasizes the importance of using data to get clear answers to policy questions,” he added.
Ganong said that in addition Chetty’s accomplishments as an academic, he has also served as an valuable adviser.
“He’s been a fantastic mentor to me...he puts a lot of time into reading my papers and always being available, and really pushing me to do my best,” Ganong said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the cheating scandal that rocked Harvard at the beginning of the school year, University President Drew G. Faust lamented the influence of current societal pressures and their impact on learning during an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday.
Faust, who has given few public statements on the controversy since news of it emerged in August, said that she fears that the desire for success causes students to miss out on the full benefits of a college education.
“I think the world puts those pressures so clearly on students that we need to think of ways to counteract that with an emphasis on how important the act of learning and the substance of learning is in itself,” Faust said.
Faust said that though the root of the problem extends far beyond campus gates, the University has a role to play in keeping students engaged and interested in learning for learning’s sake.
“It’s a kind of match between making sure we have intellectual excitement [in courses] and we have students who are interested in being intellectually excited,” she said.
Harvard first launched an investigation of 125 students in Matthew Platt’s government course “Introduction to Congress” in May after teaching fellows suspected that students may have plagiarized answers or inappropriately collaborated on the class’ final take-home exam.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris called the scope of the controversy “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory.”
Cheating allegations have led some of the accused students to temporarily withdraw from the College while the disciplinary process is underway.
The College’s Administrative Board will dole out a range of punishments to the students it finds guilty--from probation to forced withdrawal for the academic year.
Those who have voluntarily withdrawn include a number of athletes, most prominently, basketball co-captains Kyle D. Casey ‘13 and Brandyn Curry ’13.
Faust declined to discuss student athletes at Harvard in the context of the cheating scandal.
“This issue is not confined to one student group,” she said. “It includes a wide spectrum of students.”
Though attention surrounding the scandal has begun to fade since the news first broke, the topic remains on the minds of Harvard faculty members.
Faust addressed the controversy surrounding the cheating scandal in her opening statements during Tuesday’s faculty meeting.
“I hope it will provide an impetus for us to reflect on the responsibilities we all face as educators in sustaining the most constructive possible culture for learning across the College and the University,” she said, according to a report in Harvard Magazine.
Faust told The Crimson that she believed the issue had sparked an important discussion about cheating in higher education, pointing to peer institutions like Brown and Princeton that have revisited the issue on their campuses in the past month.
“People have written widely about it in ways that I think are very important,” said Faust. “I’m glad that that conversation was seeded by our actions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dario Guerrero-Meneses ’15 pulled an all-nighter on August 15, filling out his application for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program the day it came out.
“I stayed up and I got everything done and in the morning I got up and took it to the mail,” he said.
Guerrero-Meneses came to the United States from Mexico with his parents when he was two years old on a tourist visa meant for a wedding. They never left, and once the visa expired, they couldn’t renew it. That’s when they became undocumented.
Now under DACA, a program announced June 15 by the Department of Homeland Security, Guerrero-Meneses and about a million other young people who came to the United States before their 16th birthdays are able to apply for “deferred action” on their case for a period of two years.
For many undocumented youths, including those whose nearly lifelong fears of deportation and hopes for immigration reform have followed them to Harvard, DACA represents a major step toward security in America.
A SENSE OF SECURITY
“It means not living in fear anymore,” said Mary, an undocumented junior in Quincy House who asked that her real name not be used due to her immigration status. “I’m just happy having deportation protection.”
Under DACA, so-called “childhood arrivals” who were between 15 and 30 years old on June 15, 2012, can receive temporary work authorization, a Social Security number, and a two-year reprieve from immigration proceedings. The application asks them how they came to the United States and demands information including school transcripts.
To be eligible, applicants must also prove that they have graduated from high school, received their GED, or been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces. Criminal convictions for felonies, “significant misdemeanors,” or more than three misdemeanors can disqualify applicants.
After an applicant’s materials are partially processed, he or she receives a summons to come into an Application Support Center to have biometrics—fingerprints and I.D. photos—taken.
Fernando Espino ’15, an undocumented student born in Mexico, echoed Mary’s feeling of relief that the program may offer him a respite from his fear of running into legal trouble due to his immigration status.
“It’s that nagging feeling in the back of your mind that...at any point, if it’s not me, it’s my parents,” he said. “It provides me with a sense of calm and security, knowing that I can go about my normal life here without worrying about that.”
Before DACA, undocumented persons could not get a Social Security number or the ability to work legally. As a result, even those with college degrees were often relegated to jobs that paid under the table.
“In two years, I know I have two summers and advantages to take the opportunity of an internship, or a job somewhere that will hopefully lead to better things,” Espino said.
Eve, an undocumented sophomore in Winthrop House whose name was changed due to her immigration status, didn’t learn she was undocumented until she started applying for jobs in high school.
“I remember going to [Qdoba] and I got the application, but when I came to that last spot that asked for my Social Security number…I asked my dad, ‘Papi, what’s my Social Security number,’ and he didn’t answer,” she said. “And then, little did I know, I didn’t have a Social Security number.”
“I didn’t understand what that meant,” she added. “A number’s a number. It doesn’t mean anything. I’m still a person.”
Eve, who arrived in the United States on a tourist visa when she was six, turned in the application with the Social Security number slot blank. The interview went “perfectly,” she said, until she explained that she couldn’t provide the number.
“That’s when it really hit me,” Eve said. “I remember staying calm and saying okay and exiting through that door.”
But as soon as she left the fast food restaurant, Eve says she broke down.
“I ran and I ran, and I cried and I asked myself, why? Like, why me? Like, what did I do?” she said. “Like, what the—what the fuck does this number have to do with me?”
AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Like Eve, Guerrero-Meneses found out he was undocumented in high school, when he started applying to colleges.
“I told my parents that I had to fill out the FAFSA, and they said, ‘Okay, we have to have a sit-down,’” he said.
Undocumented undergraduates at Harvard—students interviewed for this article said there are around 40—are eligible for the same financial aid as U.S. citizens and permanent residents. But Harvard is one of only a handful of institutions able to offer the same aid packages to domestic students and those it deems “international.” In many states, undocumented students who grew up and went to high school in-state are ineligible for in-state tuition at public universities.
While DACA grants undocumented students a postponement on consideration of their immigration case, it does not make them eligible for federal student aid and other financial support reserved for citizens and permanent residents. These financial constraints prompt some students to opt for working rather than attending college, or to shoot for private schools that could provide enough financial aid for them to attend.
“Harvard was the only one that would give me a full scholarship,” Guerrero-Meneses said.
Luis, an undergraduate who was smuggled across the Mexico-United States border with piñatas when he was seven, said he too was unsure whether he would be able to afford college until he was accepted to Harvard.
“I figured I was going to have to go to a really inexpensive school—if I could go to college,” said Luis, who asked that only his first name be used due to his immigration status.
Herbert B. Castillo ’14, the president of Fuerza Latina, said that while some undocumented students he knows feels safe from deportation at Harvard, the student organizations’ members have discussed what happens once they graduate. Castillo also said there has been some worry about how the upcoming presidential election could affect the students who have applied for deferred action.
“Once you apply, you’re basically giving all your information away,” he said. “Some people told me they weren’t going to apply until after the election.”
Deborah E. Anker, a clinical professor of law and the director of the Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program at the Law School, also noted that the upcoming election has created trepidation for some students thinking about applying for deferred action.
“They’ve surrendered to immigration service in order to get this,” Anker said. “It takes a lot of courage to come forward right now at this incredible moment in history when this country could go in two such radically different directions. But these kids have demonstrated a lot of courage.”
As an immigration policy change for the Department of Homeland Security that was announced by the President, DACA is not a law and can be discontinued by the next administration. But the prospect of a Mitt Romney victory in November has raised worries for those applying for relief under the policy, many of whom believe Romney’s immigration track record takes a particularly harsh stance on undocumented immigrants.
Romney announced on Tuesday, however, that he would not deport those that have been granted deferred action. Instead, he said that, if elected, he will enact immigration reform before the two-year program expires.
Though widely viewed by immigration rights advocates as a bigger ally to undocumented students, President Barack Obama is on track to a harsher record on illegal immigration than past Republican presidents. Obama has deported around 1.5 million immigrants in just under four years in office.
A HOPE FOR CHANGE
Despite her experience at Qdoba, Eve did not want not to apply for deferred action at first. The program, she says, fails to address the major problems undocumented students face.
“Deferred action is a joke,” she said. “It doesn’t encourage people to continue their education…. If anything, it’s encouraging kids to work, because it’s giving you a worker’s card.”
But when she found out that the program might enable her to study abroad, Eve eventually decided to apply. Widespread misinformation about the program and its benefits—positive and negative—persists, she says, and even her lawyer was misinformed about the opportunities for travel.
The real solution for students like Eve, most people interviewed for this article said, lies not in DACA but in the passage of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act—better known as the DREAM Act—and eventually, comprehensive immigration reform.
The DREAM Act, which was first proposed in Congress in 2001, would give conditional permanent residency to undocumented people who arrived in the United States before their 16th birthdays. As with DACA, to qualify for residency, undocumented persons would need to have obtained a GED, graduated from high school, be attending or have attended college, or have served in the military for at least two years.
However, unlike DACA, DREAM Act beneficiaries would receive six-year temporary residency status, which would turn permanent if the person meets sufficient criteria.
Luis said that he believes DACA was the most Obama could accomplish without approval from Congress.
“I’m hoping that it will be replaced with something much wider, more comprehensive, that takes care of more people,” he said. “I don’t want DACA to be the end.”
Anker predicted that over the next five to ten years, the changing demographics of the country will result in immigration legislation at last.
“We need a legalization program. We need a program that, in my mind, brings the whole undocumented population out of the shadows and on a path…to permanent status,” she said. “There’s a lot of opposition to that, and that opposition is rooted in a time and place of America that’s over.”
Other students, including Espino, said that they think the U.S. needs a better immigration process in general, not just for students. Some, who said that Mexican citizens, whose American family members can file a petition for them to receive permanent residency, expect to wait an average of 20 years for their case to be considered.
“I know a lot of people would immigrate legally if the process wasn’t so convoluted, so bureaucratic, so expensive,” Espino said. “If there was a more successful way to immigrate legally, it would go a long way towards solving the issue.”
Part of Congress’ hesitancy over the DREAM Act and broader immigration reform, Anker said, stems from the fact that many Americans are not very aware of the situation that most undocumented students are in.
“I think they aren’t aware of what a large population there is of very hardworking people who are just very much wanting to pursue the American dream, who will be incredible workers and citizens in the future,” she said. “The rhetoric of the last several years has been about ‘criminal aliens.’”
But some students who have long struggled against barriers for undocumented students—the emotional ones and the legal ones—think that DACA could be the stepping stone to a more permanent and more positive policy.
“Instead of demonizing the person, look at how messed up the law is, that so many people are having to do this,” Mary said. “I hope that DACA will lead the way to another step up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 7, 2012, at 6:57 p.m.
At a monthly meeting of the Graduate Student Council on Wednesday, members of the Council discussed whether the Council should continue with a representative democracy or move toward a direct democracy system. A proposed change would allow non-departmental representatives to vote on the issues that the GSC puts forth.
Currently, each department gets one, two, or three votes based on the number of registered students in the department, according to President of the GSC, Cammi N. Valdez. A department gets one vote if it has between 1 and 35 people, two votes if it has between 36 and 70 people, and three votes if it has 71 or more people.
“Our constitution states that it is up to the department to choose the way they elect or select their representatives,” Valdez explained. “The issue of direct democracy has not been brought up prior to this year.”
Patrick L. Rich, Secretary of the GSC, said he finds the question of direct democracy to be “interesting and important.”
“A few people on the executive board are going to organize a forum where people interested in talking about this can directly voice their opinions. The idea would be that anyone interested in that issue will come and speak,” Rich said.
Jennifer A. Sheehy-Skeffington, the international students at large representative for the GSC, said that this discussion points out flaws within the current system.
“I think that the issue of universal suffrage is coming up as an indication of the failing in the democratic structure of the GSC,” Sheehy-Skeffington said.
“When it comes to elections of members of the executive committee, I think all grad students should have a vote, just as students do at the undergraduate level.”
Because the meeting concluded before the issues was resolved, the discussion on this and other amendments will be the first subjects considered in the GSC’s next meeting, according to Sheehy-Skeffington.
Although the group did not come to a consensus on this issue, they were able to pass one amendment by the end of the session. This change will add a provision in the constitution for the removal of Executive Board members who fail to attend, without a valid excuse, more than a quarter of the required meetings, according to Sheehy-Skeffington.
In addition to these topics, members of the Harvard University Police Department spoke about student safety, a new Treasurer was voted upon, and the members of each GSC committee were chosen. Towards the end of the meeting different recommendations made by the Constitutional and Bylaws Committee were read and people voted to change or talk about, or table each amendment.

Human development and human rights experts met on Wednesday at the Harvard School of Public Health to evaluate the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals and to plan for what will be put in place when the goals expire in 2015.
The meeting was the first of a multi-author review of the UN’s Millennium Development Goals intending to determine what was successful from the previous plans, what unexpected challenges were faced, and what new problems have emerged that must be addressed.
The study leaders, UN officials, and human development and human rights experts debated what criteria should be used to choose indicators that will best assess the current state of development, and ultimately, what is the best course of action after 2015.
“These eight [Millennium Development Goals] have become these massive poverty goals, but they expire in 2015, so the entire international community is organizing around the UN to figure out what comes next,” said Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, a Professor of International Affairs at the New School.
The study will address how politics has influenced the UN’s priorities and why some goals succeeded while others failed.
“The reason why the [Millennium Development Goals] got so much traction in an unprecedented way and caught the imagination of people is because they are expressed as numeric targets, they are concrete and have real action,” said Fukuda-Parr.
The discussion brought about dissenting opinions on how to evaluate the global state as accurately as possible.
“We at the [Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights] have developed frameworks for national contexts. How do we translate these indicators of success to a global scale?” said Grace Sanico Steffan, a human rights officer the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Many at the meeting wished to avoid setting specific numerical constraints and framing their evaluations in legalisms, noting the dangers of using a prescriptive framework to gauge successes.
“Our main question is, does the way that the targets are set and prescribed have an impact on the results? I think that everybody is realizing how difficult this issue of evaluating the impact of a global development agenda is, but how important it is in shaping national policies, “ said Diana Alarcon, a senior economic affairs officer within the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
The study contributes to a larger goal of granting civil society members a role in shaping the UN’s development plans. Participants of the meeting said they aim to implement an institutional platform for communications between the UN and outside study leaders in the future.

Visiting professor Sayuri Guthrie-Shimizu traced the spread of baseball across the Pacific in the 19th and 20th centuries on Tuesday as part of a lecture series on U.S.-Japan Relations sponsored by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
Guthrie-Shimizu, who hails from Michigan State University, discussed the introduction of baseball to Japan, the topic of her recently published book, “Transpacific Field of Dreams: How Baseball Linked the United States and Japan in Peace and War.”
According to Guthrie-Shimizu, Americans working for the Japanese government in the 1870s first brought the classic pastime to the country. Because U.S.-Japan relations were strong during this period, the country was receptive to adopting the new sport.
By the early 20th century, baseball had spread to Hawaii, Taiwan, Korea, and the Philippines through interactions with Japan and the U.S., she said.
Guthrie-Shimizu argues in her book that the rise of baseball in the U.S. is due primarily to the commercialization of the sport, rather than any intrinsic appeal for players or spectators.
“It embodies that best of America,” she said. “The image of being clean-cut, healthy, strong, wholesome. It was a marketing ploy that worked.”
Baseball was spread as a result of human migration, colonialism, and its profit-generating potential, Guthrie-Shimizu said.
The seminar series “provides opportunities for faculty and students to interact with speakers from outside,” said Shinju Fujihira, associate director of the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations.
According to Fujihira, the average seminar attendance has increased in recent years, despite the narrow focus of each topic. As a result of globalization, the Harvard community has become more interested in international affairs, he said.
Ayu Majima, an associate hosted by the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations, said that she was interested in attending the lecture because she is currently conducting research on athlete’s foot in Japan and the United States—a topic that is similarly related to the “sports and history” shared by the two countries.

James H. Fowler, a professor of medical genetics and political science at the University of California, San Diego, explored the effects of social networks on human interaction in a lecture on Wednesday, arguing that an individual’s behavior has an impact far beyond their immediate social circle.
“The ultimate question is this,” said Fowler in his talk at the Harvard Kennedy School. “When one person changes does that cause another person to change? And then another person? And another, like falling dominoes?”
A study authored by Fowler and sociology professor Nicholas A. Christakis entitled ‘The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network Over 32 Years,’ concluded that people are more likely to be obese if their friends are obese. Further research revealed that this tendency was true for friends of friends and even friends of friends of friends.
Both men’s work led to the ultimate conclusion that obesity was not so much an “epidemic,” as it is so often labeled, but rather that it occurred in clusters – in networks. They determined that this principle applies just as equally to smoking, happiness, loneliness, and depression.
However, after much outcry by statisticians that the sample used for their conclusions was not sufficiently randomized or controlled, they turned to a much larger population – the 61 million Facebook users in the United States who logged on to the website on election day 2010.
They created an experiment in which 60 million users were shown an ‘I Voted’ button that they could click, accompanied by the faces of friends who had already clicked the button. 600,000 users were shown the same button, but without their friends’ faces and 600,000 users were not shown the button at all.
Through this study, they determined that by clicking the “I Voted” button, a user created a probability increase of .9% that their friends would express that they too voted and an increase of 1.8% in the probability that their friends actually voted, translating to about 280,000 more votes cast.
Fowler said that this study and its focus on human interactions hold significant weight for analyses of human behavior.
“Networks are a fundamental part of our biology as a species. We are human because we network,” said Fowler.
Fowler said that the next step in his study is focusing on the driving forces behind these results.
“Why is it that these social networks have such a large impact and how can we learn from it to help us do better in the real world?” said Fowler. “I hope that people will come to understand the effect they have on the lives, not only of the people they can see, but the people they can’t see. It makes you live life a little differently.”

Harvard officially established the first endowed faculty position for LGBTQ studies in the nation on Wednesday.
Henry D. Abelove ’66, who retired as an English professor from Wesleyan University in 2011, will serve as the first F.O. Matthiessen Visiting Professor of Gender and Sexuality, a one-semester position that is responsible for teaching classes on LGBTQ issues. The chaired professorship is the result of a $1.5 million endowment that was raised by efforts of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus.
“I was interested in Matthiessen and had written about him, so I was thrilled to be given this position,” said Abelove of the storied Harvard English professor, who was also openly gay. “My goals here are to teach my courses well, to find ways to be intellectually useful on campus.”
Lecturer on History and Literature Timothy P. McCarthy ‘93, who has served on the HGLC board since 2006, coordinated the event that honored Abelove as the first Matthiessen visiting professor.
“Since the HGLC took part in the fundraising for the creation of the Matthiessen Chair, I thought it was really important that we have something to welcome professor Abelove back to Harvard after all these years,” McCarthy said. “It’s a big achievement to have raised $1.5 million to endow a chaired professorship.”
In a casual, open conversation meant to also serve as his official welcome to the University, Abelove spoke about his work with LGBTQ studies and invited participants to engage in discussion about its history and evolution. In particular, Abelove touched on the changes in the LGBTQ life at Harvard since his graduation in 1966 and the role of social networking in today’s LGBTQ dating scene.
McCarthy said that the event, co-sponsored by Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality and the Carr Center’s Sexuality, Gender, and Human Rights Program, was meant to promote more critical discussions on campus and to also create another space for students and faculty to talk about gender and sexuality issues.
“The institutionalization of gender and sexuality studies has been a slow coming. Here at Harvard, we have yet to achieve departmental status,” McCarthy said. “Events like these are just meant to create another space for us to talk about how these issues intersect with women and gender studies.”
Under the Matthiessen professorship, Harvard is able to invite scholars studying LGBTQ-related issues to teach as part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for one semester. Professors will be chosen with the input of faculty members, who will nominate other potential candidates for the chairship.

Michelle L. Picard ’15 didn’t believe the rumors about mice in the River Houses when she moved into Adams House. That changed. She woke up one morning to find a mouse in her toilet.
“I flushed him,” Picard said.
Picard isn’t the only one at Harvard with rodent experiences. During Thanksgiving break, Doo Young Na ’14 and his brother were hanging out, playing FIFA in a mostly abandoned Cabot House, when he saw out of the corner of his eye what looked like a “big chunk of dust” running through the room.
“Given that there are ‘no rats in the Quad,’ I thought it was just a huge chunk of dust. Then the dust appeared again and changed directions,” Na said.
Na and his brother went back to FIFA, but later, when they saw the mouse again, Na said they “freaked out” and decided there was no option but to try to catch it. After “running around the room like crazy,” the brothers gave up and went to bed. Na successfully caught the mouse the next day with a mouse trap and peanut butter.
Allison J. Scott ’14 often sees what she suspects is a family of rats eating from a trash can in the annex of Kirkland House. Scott suggested emptying the trash can more often, noting that rat poison would be dangerous with the number of dogs on campus, especially in Kirkland.
Gary D. Alpert, associate of the Museum of Comparative Zoology who used to be entomology officer of Environmental Health and Safety for Harvard, agreed with Scott that the solution comes from denying rodents their source of food.
“The correct strategy is exclusion,” Alpert said. “The University has done that successfully.”
Each of the Houses has a pest control program in place, according to Leverett Building Manager Paul Hegarty. But the rat problem isn’t all in the House’s control. Many rodents spend nights scurrying around the MBTA in Harvard Station.
“I took the last train from downtown to go back to the school and got off at the Harvard, and there were these rats on the platform just sniffing around,” Na said. “They were huge.”
George Williams, staff entomologist of regional pest control company Environmental Health & Safety, explained that because Greater Boston is one of the oldest urban areas in America, Cambridge is very susceptible to rats.
“There are tunnels that lead to tunnels that lead to even more tunnels that we don’t even know about,” Williams said
Other factors, according to Williams, include the downturn in the economy, which has led to abandoned properties and budget cuts.
EH&S provides pest control services for the greater Boston area, focusing on structural exclusion of pests. Harvard is not one of the company’s clients, but it does provide inspections, consultations, and services for properties that are managed separately within the Harvard community.
Harvard has taken steps to address the campus rat problem in the past. In 2009, Harvard spent roughly $250,000 to purchase rodent-resistant trash cans for North Allston. Last Monday, the Cambridge City Council unanimously approved an order to devote more money and attention to the presence of rats in the city.
The issue is not foreign to the Council. It is one that Councillor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom has championed in her tenure. She said that she ran for City Council after working with people in her neighborhood to combat the rodent problem in the city.
“The only way to do it is to do it slowly but steadily over a long period,” vanBeuzekom said.

More than 700 Harvard students crammed into bleachers and stairwells at the Institute of Politics to watch Wednesday’s presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Republican Nominee Mitt Romney, the first of a series of opportunities for the two candidates to defend their platform positions.
The watch party, hosted by the IOP in the JFK Forum and preceded by a panel discussion, was intended to raise awareness within the University community about the events preceding the upcoming November election, IOP Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said.
“People might be more likely to watch the debate if they can go with their friends,” he added.
Students agreed that the opportunity to attend a public viewing provided an additional incentive to attend.
“The spirit is unbelievable,” Aleeza H. Hashmi ’15 said.
Wednesday’s debate, moderated by NewsHour Executive Editor Jim Lehrer, was punctuated by a series of zingers from both candidates during the hour-and-a-half prime-time television event. Students reacted boisterously between exchanges, disagreeing with controversial claims made by either candidate or cheering after their preferred candidate’s retorts.
“It’s fun to watch it with a bunch of IOP people so that when you shout, ‘That’s not true,’ everyone else nods and agrees,” Jake W. Silberg ’15 said.
Many, however, disagreed on whom they thought performed better during the debate. Some, like Spencer L. Todd ’13, said that they thought that Romney outperformed the president.
“I think that because the main topic is the economy, it’s Mitt Romney’s strong suit, and he’s done surprisingly well,” he said.
But Jasmine S. Burnett ’16 disagreed, commending the president on his delivery.
“Mitt Romney appeared to be more snappy, but Obama came across as more well thought-out,” she said. “I think that Obama did a really good job—he stuck to the policies he’s supported all along while Romney came up with all these new things without explaining them with facts.”
Before the watch party, Grayson hosted a panel discussion at the IOP. The panelists included Carole Simpson, the first woman and first person of color to moderate a U.S. presidential debate, and Mark McKinnon, the former chief media advisor to President George W. Bush.
“I’ve come to the conclusion that debates are about style, not substance,” Simpson said during the panel. “It’s a performance art.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Simpson added that campaign viewing events, such as the one hosted by the IOP, are essential for youth engagement in politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team of hackers protesting the state of modern higher education has released data mined from the servers of Harvard and at least 100 other major universities.
The hacked data was posted online Monday morning under the heading ‘Project WestWind’ by a band of hackers known as Team GhostShell. The release stated that their goal was to “raise awareness towards the changes made in today’s education.”
The data mined from Harvard’s servers appears to be relatively innocuous. Course descriptions—mostly for classes in dance or theatrical technique—make up a large portion of the release, along with identification numbers for student groups and codes for local towns. No passwords, credit card numbers, grades, evaluations, or other confidential information appear to have been compromised.
Other institutions were not so lucky. According to IdentityFinder, a firm specializing in identity theft prevention, 36,623 unique email addresses were released, along with at least one bank account number, a number of username and password combinations, and significant amounts of personal data.
“Based upon a casual sampling of time stamps in the data set, it appears that the hackers spent at least four months aggregating the information prior to release,” said Aaron Titus, Identity’s Finder’s Chief Privacy Officer in a statement.
At the University of Pennsylvania, the Daily Pennsylvanian confirmed that records such as currency card numbers, full names, and email addresses for students, faculty, and staff had been released.
Team GhostShell told The Crimson in an email that its aim was not to inflict harm.“
The point of it all was not to harm the people themselves, but to bring everyone’s attention to the downfall of today’s education and at the same time [to] the fact that their security is a joke,” said a spokesperson for GhostShell.
The source, who due to the criminal nature of his activities declined to provide his name, can only be identified by his online username, DeadMellox.
This is not the first time Team GhostShell has attempted to use hacked data to send a broader message. This summer, the group attacked Italian government servers to protest the supposed presence of ultra-nationalist and racist tones in European foreign policy. Targets of previous operations include stock exchanges, banks, consulting firms, and research labs at MIT.
Multiple members of the Harvard University Information Technology Department refused to comment on the alleged breach.
“Harvard University is vigilant in working to protect all of its information. As a policy, the University does not comment on reports of breaches. If and when a breach occurs, the University corrects the problem immediately, notifies all affected parties as soon as possible, and reviews protocols broadly to prevent similar incidents in the future,” wrote Nicholas L. Connors, a communications officer for HUIT, in an emailed statement after he could not be reached by phone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1992, a Teen Talk Barbie doll was released. Shortly after it began selling, it went from saying 270 phrases to 269. The manufacturing company, Mattel, Inc., took out one phrase—”math class is tough”—after receiving criticisms for fueling a stereotype that women were less capable at quantitative disciplines.
While that incident took place more than two decades ago, the stereotype endures: that men are innately more tuned to excel in quantitative sciences where women are better suited to study softer disciplines. And at Harvard, gender ratios confirm a slight bias.
“I actually had no idea that it was going to be all female,” said Tenley A. Malmquist ’13 about her concentration, anthropology. “We joke about it.”
Anthropology at Harvard remains one of the most imbalanced concentrations in the social sciences, with the percentage of male concentrators at about 22 percent in spring 2011 and 17.5 percent in 2012.
“You kind of can’t miss it,” said Elizabeth “Penny” Rew, the undergraduate coordinator for anthropology.
Though the size of small departments can skew the gender ratios of departments in the social sciences, the trends seem fairly consistent. But students and faculty members say that this visible imbalance is not a function of gender predispositions, the controversial debate the Barbie doll sparked—and more influenced by social norms and career aspirations.
BEYOND THE NUMBERS
In much of popular culture, the guys typically take derivatives while the girls recite poems, and in older academic literature, men were determined to be more quantitative-minded while women were seen as more humanities-oriented. But Harvard faculty members and students say that stereotype might be only that—and does not explain the gender ratios within Harvard concentrations.
“It’s certainly not anything to do with the [difference between] hard and soft sciences,” said Cheryl B. Welch, director for undergraduate studies for the department of government has become a more balanced concentration. Between the years 2006 and 2010, the percentage of male concentrators in the government department dropped from about 63 percent to about 48 percent of all concentrators, with men now forming a slight minority.
That trend is in line with current scholarship on the topic. According to a 2009 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, differences in academic performance by gender have narrowed, with only a trivial difference in outcomes, since the 21st century. A study published by the U.S. Department of Education was even more specific in quantifying this marginal difference; the report found the relationship between sex and quantitative skills in the classroom scored a .1 on a scale of 0 to 1.
“Undergraduates come in with very similar interests and very similar training,” government professor Beth A. Simmons said. “I don’t believe that men are more drawn to mathematical modeling than [women]—all the women I speak to have really good econometrics training.”
ONE OF THE GUYS
But while an innate difference between men and women might not determine the gender ratios inside the classroom, existing unbalanced ratios might be self-perpetuating, Harvard students said. The perception, they said, of some concentrations to be less “manly,” for example, might push men away from certain concentrations.
Between the years 2006 and 2010, the average proportion of males among the degree candidates in sociology and psychology were about 31 percent and 29 percent, respectively. The anthropology department’s average ratio of 26 percent was lower still.
“Your buddies are econ majors,” Rew said of male undergraduates. “If you’re a guy, it seems that you’ve got to choose what some may think of as a ‘guy concentration.’”
And it works both ways. Psychology concentrator Alexa Fishman ’13 said that while she was unsure about what might lead to the skewed gender ratios, she thought her concentration might pull more females because of the perception of its post-graduation work.
“Psychology is a discipline where a lot of people go into counseling,” she said, adding that the stereotype of “lying on a couch and talking about feelings” might draw more females into the department.
“The default is, ‘Oh, this is what men study,’“ said Amanda I. Morejon ’13, a sociology and studies of women, gender, and sexuality joint concentrator. “That’s unfortunately socially constructed off these very old fashioned ideas—that men are logically based and women are more creative-minded.”
CONCENTRATING ON CAREERS
For many, economics serves as a pre-professional concentration of sorts, the closest many see to an undergraduate business degree, even though the department does not identify as such.
“My impression is that 50 to 80 percent of ec concentrators, by the time they are juniors, have a pretty good idea about what they want to do,” said economics director of undergraduate studies Jeffrey A. Miron. He added that finance, consulting, law school, and business school are the most frequently sought paths post-graduation.
Economics, the largest concentration at the College, has historically posted a higher percentage of male undergraduates; between 2006 and 2010, the proportion of male degree candidates ranged from 63 to 73 percent, according to the Harvard University Fact Book.
Rew said that career pressures may have influenced gender ratios in the social sciences, stemming from long-held perceptions of men as breadwinners.
“Women are less afraid to choose a non-conventional major like anthropology,” she said. “Although women may expect to pursue the same distinguished careers as men, I suspect that when choosing their college majors, fewer men than women are absolutely comfortable in exploring or committing to some of the less-traveled concentration options offered at Harvard.”
THE LIMIT DOES NOT EXIST
But Harvard classrooms show greater diversity in gender than classrooms in other universities across the nation. Because the ratios in the classrooms are not exaggerated as other national universities, students said that they can comfortably ignore any imbalance.
In economics, 70.2 percent of degrees were conferred to men across the country in 2009-2010, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Harvard awarded 63.7 percent of degrees in economics to men and 36.3 percent to women.The national percentage for degrees award to men in psychology nationally is 23.0 percent; at Harvard it was 29.5 percent.
The national percentage for sociology nationally is 30.6 percent for men and 34.1 percent at Harvard.
At Harvard, students said they don’t see the imbalances.
“Maybe I don’t pay attention to it, but I’ve never felt, ‘Man, there aren’t enough girls in this class,’” economics concentrator Jacques A. Barjon ’13 said.
Neither do students pay attention in the converse, psychology concentrator Francisco D. Hernandez, Jr., ’13 said. “It’s not like I go to class and all I see are women,” he said. “It doesn’t matter to me—I don’t think students on campus think about that.”
Still researchers show concern about the impact that a continued trajectory of divided classrooms might have in education.
Stereotype threat, the anxiety experienced by an individual who is afraid to confirm an unfavorable stereotype about her racial or sexual group, can hamper academic performance among female students studying traditionally male-dominated tracks such as physics or similarly, and among male students in female-slanted academic fields. For example, a March 2005 study published by Psychological Science reported that stereotype threat negatively influences female performance on mathematics tests.
While divided classes can encourage these negative stereotypes, gender imbalance can also influence power dynamics and negotiation ability of students in the classroom. Boys view themselves as significantly more entitled than girls, and more likely to confront teachers about unfair grades, suggests a December 2008 study by the Journal of Genetic Psychology.
Still, Harvard represents a more progressive environment in gender imbalances within academic campuses. In ‘Mean Girls,’ Lindsay Lohan joins the high school Mathletes team, and is the only student girl on the team. While Harvard retains some unequal gender ratios, women do not have to be afraid to be the only female in the room.

Northeastern junior Crystal Poland scored two goals in the first 15 minutes of the Harvard field hockey team’s midweek contest against the Huskies, helping her side to a 4-1 win and pushing her to No. 2 in the country in goals scored so far this season. After a scorching four-goal first half, No. 8 Northeastern (9-2, 2-1 CAA) was able to hold onto its lead and beat the Crimson (3-7, 1-2 Ivy) Wednesday night at Jordan Field.
“[The Huskies] obviously have some really talented players,” co-captain Kim Goh said. “Our game plan was adjusted to sort of compensate for that…but it took a little bit of flow to figure out how that was going to work on the field.”
Although the Crimson outshot the visitors, 15-14, and had seven penalty corners to the Huskies’ six, Harvard was unable to convert many of its chances.
Although the two teams were nearly even in several statistical categories, the first half of the game was a lopsided display, as Northeastern was able to keep the ball mainly on Harvard’s half of the field.
The Huskies started strong, scoring off of a penalty corner in the fourth minute of play. Poland was able to convert the first corner of the game, sending a shot into the cage off of an assist from teammates Lindsay Graham and Nicky Bennett.
“[Northeastern] came in ranked No. 8 and knew it,” Goh said. “We had the opportunity to upset them. But instead of looking at it that way, we thought of [the game] as a chance to play one of the best teams in the nation.”
The Huskies added to their tally eight minutes later off of another corner, with Kelly Dunn receiving the ball after a scrabble in the box and scooping it up into the top-left corner of the net.
The Huskies kept the pressure on the home team throughout the entire first half, outshooting their Crimson counterparts, 9-4.
“I think [Northeastern] did very well in stretching the field,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “They had a really good penalty corner, and were able to get into our box a little too often. Where they are, and where we’re not yet, is that they’re able to take very quick shots even from a difficult angle.”
Poland added her second goal off of another penalty corner in the fifteenth minute of the game, once again assisted by Bennett and Graham. Kate Carlson put in one more unassisted goal near the end of the half to put Harvard in a 4-0 hole heading into the break.
The penalty kill for Northeastern was lethal in the first half, with the away team scoring off of three of its four penalty corners.
“We gave up a few too many corners, and [the Huskies] were really able to use that against us,” Goh said .
The game was tipped on its head at the half, however, as Harvard came out and held the Huskies scoreless for the rest of the game, outshooting Northeastern,  11-5.
Early in the half, a through-pass to freshman Elizabeth Jacobson that split the Northeastern defense nearly made it 4-1 but the ball slipped just wide of the frame.
The Crimson was more effective on both offense and defense in the second half, pushing the ball farther up the field and keeping it out of its own defensive end.
With fifteen minutes left, the Crimson was rewarded with three successive penalty corners, all of which led to shots. Junior Bridget McGillivray was able to put two consecutive shots on goal.
The offensive momentum finally paid off when Harvard was awarded a penalty stroke with less than 10 minutes to go in the game. Goh was able to convert from the spot, pushing the Crimson back within three, 4-1.
“As a defender you don’t get a lot of chances to score,” Goh said. “I was happy that I was able to make it and put one on the board for us. We got a little bit of payoff for our hard work.”
But the attempt at a comeback was too little, too late, and the Huskies were able to close out the game without allowing another score despite Harvard’s impressive second-half performance.
“I think we showed up a little too late,” van Herwaarden said. “I think we were a little scared of playing the No. 8 team in the nation, but [at halftime] we were able to reiterate our plan for the game. I think we outplayed them in the second half because we were a little stronger. We outshot them and out-cornered them.”

The Harvard women’s soccer team—currently on a two-game winning streak after recent victories over New Hampshire and rival Yale—will meet a Cornell squad on Saturday that has just registered its first win of the season.
The game will see the Crimson (5-3-2, 1-1 Ivy) delve further into conference play at home on Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, as it battles the Big Red (1-10, 0-2 Ivy), and looks to continue its rise in the Ancient Eight standings. Harvard has not lost to Cornell since 1992.
This season has not been without its missteps for the Big Red. Tuesday’s 4-1 win over Lafayette broke what had been a 10-game losing streak.
Cornell’s four goals on the game marked a season high for the team, which has put up just 14 goals total in comparison with the 31 that it has allowed opponents.
Leading the Big Red in tallies is co-captain Maneesha Chitanvis, who has tallied four goals so far this year, including two against the Leopards.
Senior Xandra Hompe holds the team high in points, with 10 split between three goals and four assists, three of which came against Lafayette. Hompe was the first player for Cornell to tally three assists in a game since 1991.
Defensively, junior goalkeeper Tori Christ has seen the most time in net, starting in 10 contests this year.
Tuesday marked her first collegiate victory, relieving freshman Caroline Quentin after the first half. Christ made one save in the final 10 seconds of the game. The junior has recorded 56 saves this season, registering a 2.73 goals-against average.
Regardless of any hiccups the Big Red has had thus far, Harvard will enter the game conscious of Cornell’s strengths.
“We always have high expectations for every Ivy League team,” sophomore Meg Casscells-Hamby said. “Every Ivy-League game we play is a battle, and we prepare ourselves for that every time. Cornell is a very good team, and we are going to bring the best game we have on Saturday.”
On Tuesday, Harvard took down the Wildcats, 2-1, on the road in a match that featured big plays from junior co-captain Peyton Johnson as well as freshman forward Emily Mosbacher.
Johnson netted one goal and one assist, the latter of which came on the game-winning header by Mosbacher past New Hampshire goalkeeper Erin Jackson.
Sophomore goalkeeper Cheta Emba earned a career-high eight saves against the Wildcats. New Hampshire provided plenty of offensive pressure, outshooting the Crimson, 9-4, in the second half and 18-13 for the game.
Emba filled in for sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten, who has started all nine games she has played in this season.
Kanten has recorded a record of 4-3-2 this year, with shutouts against Massachusetts, Central Connecticut State, and the Bulldogs.
She currently holds a goals-against average of 1.41, with an Ancient-Eight average of .49, a stat that places her at No. 2 in the conferenc. Kanten has nabbed 37 saves for a .755 save percentage.
“[Against Cornell,] we’re going to keep playing how we’ve been playing,” Kanten said. “A game is just a game. It’s not about our record or their record.”
In the Crimson’s most recent conference game, Yale and Harvard struggled through a stalemate in regulation play. Four minutes into overtime, sophomore midfielder Lauren Urke rushed down the right side of the field and was able to connect with Casscells-Hamby, who fired the game-winner past Bulldog goalkeeper Rachel Ames.
The win brought Harvard to .500 in Ancient-Eight play and pulled the Crimson up from the bottom of the Ivy League standings to fourth place—a slot the team currently shares with Dartmouth.
Last year was the closest the Big Red has come to a victory against Harvard in recent years. The Crimson lost its lead twice in one game to tie Cornell, 2-2, in Ithaca, N.Y. Harvard goals came from then-junior Aisha Price and then-sophomore Elizabeth Weisman.
This season, Price has put up four points while Weisman has earned five so far.
The team remains level-headed about conference play and the challenges ahead.
“We just focus on what we can do to prepare ourselves for the upcoming game,” Casscells-Hamby said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Call me crazy, but I think the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-5-3, 0-0-1 Ivy) is looking better than it has in a long time. Allow me to explain.
The last two seasons were plagued by high expectations and a lot of individual talent not realized as a team. The Crimson began both campaigns as a national contender and instead finished near the bottom of the Ivy League—including the program’s first winless conference season and a last-place finish in 2011.
Coming into Harvard’s third year under coach Carl Junot, expectations were much more tempered, but the individual talent of the players remained almost unchanged. An offensive reshuffling occurred near the end of the 2011 campaign, and—despite injuries to some veteran players—Harvard found itself starting the fall tactically secure.
The first seven games were less than kind to the Crimson, as Junot’s deliberately difficult non-conference schedule took a toll on a Harvard team still figuring out its identity. Highlighted by a 1-0 victory at home against Michigan State and lowlighted by a 6-0 thrashing at the hands of No. 2 UConn, Harvard entered the first weekend of conference play with a record of 1-5-1.
On Saturday night, it hosted rival Yale at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium and—for the first time I can remember since opening weekend in 2010—totally dominated its opponent, although the game ended in a 0-0 tie. Controlling possession and outshooting the Bulldogs by greater than a 2-1 margin, Harvard proved that—barring a catastrophic collapse—it will not be a basement dweller in the Ancient Eight for much longer.
On Tuesday, the Crimson hosted crosstown rival Boston College. Sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi scored his second goal of the year off a header at 1:21, and even though the contest ended in a tie, 1-1, Harvard regained some respect in a series in which it hadn’t scored since 2009.
You may think that basing my judgment off of two ties in a three-day span is a little rash, but this is more about the way the team is playing than the results they are seeing in the box score. The Crimson showed a level of team unity this week that had been lacking in the past, and Junot seems to be a couple tweaks away from having a consistently solid starting eleven.
Though Junot has not committed to a starter at goalie, freshman Joe Festa appears to have won favor over classmate Evan Mendez in replacing presumed starter Brett Conrad—his .774 save percentage is fourth-best in the Ancient Eight.
The back four may be Harvard’s best unit. Co-captain Richard Smith and freshman Mark Ashby—who missed a couple games due to injury but appears to be in good form—hold the central line, while sophomore David Barna and junior Ross Friedman double as offensive catalysts up the wing and defensive holders in the back.
A midfield of co-captain Scott Prozeller, junior Kyle Henderson, and sophomore Tim Schmoll has done a good job controlling the ball in the middle third and getting the ball up to the forwards.
The final step for Junot and the Crimson will be finding a consistent threat up top. Prozeller, senior Zack Wolfenzon, freshmen Oliver White and Jake Freeman, and Kobayashi have all scored, but only Kobayashi has scored more than once. Sophomore Michael Innocenzi has also shown promise and junior Connor McCarthy has speed that is always dangerous, but none of the forwards have asserted themselves as the go-to guy so far this season.
The quality of the rest of the team was able to prevent this from becoming an issue in its last two matches, but Harvard’s next two fixtures are against the best the Ivy League has to offer in No. 18 Cornell (9-0-0, 1-0-0) and No. 19 Brown (8-1-1, 1-0-0). The Big Red and the Bears are clearly the class of the Ivy League this season, but if Harvard can contain Cornell forward Daniel Harber—who has scored a league-leading 14 goals this year (second place has just five)—and win a point or three from either the Big Red or Brown, then the Crimson may just find itself in prime position to finish in the top half of the Ancient Eight.
For a program that has won 13 conference titles—including one as recently as 2009—a finish in the top half may not seem like much. But after the last two seasons, it would be a much-needed step in the right direction for Junot and his team. I think they’ll be able to pull it off.

In preparation for Pfoho's '90s dance this Saturday, Flyby brings you the best throwbacks from this lovable but fashion-backward decade.
1. All-Boy and All-Girl Bands. Probably the only time that gender separation was totally acceptable. Bands like the Spice Girls, *NSYNC, and the Backstreet Boys dazzled the decade, even if their platform sneakers and frosted tips reminiscent of ramen noodles didn't.
2. Taking Care of Inanimate Objects. Between teaching Furbys English and making sure their Tamagotchi creatures were properly fed, '90s kids may have been prematurely introduced to parenthood (what else were they supposed to do before iPhones?).
3. Valspeak. Alicia Silverstone's Cher in "Clueless" immortalized not only plaid suits and argyle skirts but also introduced us to sporadically charming jargon like, "Oh my God, I am totally buggin'," "She's a full-on Monet," and the unforgettable, "As if!"
4. Steve Urkel. The socially awkward "Family Matters" character wore hipster glasses way before they were ironic.
5. Songs That Told You What To Do. Everyone could pass as a decent dancer thanks to songs like "Vogue," "Jump," and "Everybody Dance Now (Gonna Make You Sweat)."
6. Teen Programming. If "Boy Meets World" and "My So-Called Life" didn't teach you enough life lessons, "Clarissa Explains It All" made sure you knew how to dress (back when neon leggings, scrunchies, and overalls were a thing).
7. Overly-Complex Dramas. Although David Lynch and Mark Frost's "Twin Peaks" developed more of a cult following than a broad fan base, its peculiar storylines made viewers appreciate "damn fine cup[s] of coffee," handwritten diaries, and people of all shapes and sizes.
8. Will Smith Being Funny. Even if Smith's transition into dramatic territory has been mostly successful (we'll forgive him for "Seven Pounds"), we can't help but be nostalgic for his stylish and suave persona on "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."
9. Grunge. This movement made Seattle relevant again, thanks to groups like Nirvana and their steadfast belief in flannel shirts and long, unwashed hair.
10. Old School Britney Spears. Oh, innocent Brit, we miss you and your inappropriate school uniforms most of all! Even if the '90s are long gone, we still believe in you.

Though both candidates spent far more than their allotted time bickering over the numbers, Flyby's debate recap will take a more qualitative approach. Herewith, some superlatives.
Most partisan ties: Shout out to both candidates for the handy reminder of which ticket they're running on.
Best anniversary present: A night with Mitt Romney. But seriously, congrats guys.
Least time wasted before playing the baby card: Romney mentioned a tot he met on his travels 40 seconds in.
Romney's most adamant endorsement: Coal. By the way, he likes it.
Fastest flip flop: Obama identified himself as part of the one  percent who could afford a tax hike ("Folks like me and him [Romney]")  and then, just minutes later, referred to the "folks like me and  Michelle" who relied on government support for student loans. (Both,  incidentally, are true.)
Truest unrelated things: "I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about." -Mitt Romney
Dumbest question (thanks, Jim!): "Do you believe there's a  difference between the two of you as to how you view the role of the  federal government?" Nah... but since you asked, we might be able to  come up with something.
Biggest bird in the room: Naturally, Big Bird came up. Mitt Romney likes PBS, he likes Big Bird, and he actually likes Jim Leher.
Most ageist comments: Romney's. Seriously, if you're over 60 there's really no need to listen to these guys.
 
 Romney's fondest memories: Massachusetts Mondays. Those good old days in the Bay State involved weekly bipartisan meetings and lots of other fun times.
 
 Jim Lehrer's fondest memory: That time at the beginning of the debate when both candidates stuck roughly to the two minute answer rule.

This week's Crimson Arts cover story is about Polish poet and Harvard professor Stanislaw Baranczak. The piece focuses on Baranczak's careful negotiation of his political responsibilities to his country and his own desire to write for writing's sake. Here's a poem by Baranczak that didn't make it into the article but is still worth a read:
SETTING THE HAND BRAKE
In an empty suburban parking lot, setting the hand brake,
he wonders what it actually was that brought him here
and why on earth he was never able not to succumb
to the clichés of sorrow, familiar to all who practice
the invisible craft of exile. There always will be a homeland
of asphalt under the chilly streetlamps, a homeland of rusty crossties
under a pair of rails, which likewise can count on meeting
in infinity only; a homeland that comes along and apart,
that rushes forward with him in the canyons of floorboard cracks
and lights in strangers’ windows, and his veins, and trajectories
of galactic explosion. What is it that still holds him here,
pins him down, encloses him in the circumference
of this and not another skin, planet, suburban parking lot.
And whence this arrogated, arrogant right to exile,
as if it weren’t true that no one will fall asleep tonight
on his own Earth. There will be a homeland somewhere: an involuntarily chosen
second of awakening in motion, in the middle of a breathless whisper
a comma place by chance, by mistake, for the time being, forever.
If you want even more Polish poetry, here is my favorite of Nobel-prize winning author Czeslaw Milosz's many poems. ("I did not want to love so" is inscribed in the original Polish on one of my notebooks.) Here Milosz, 30 years prior to Baranczak's rise to prominence, reflects on his role as a Polish public intellectual,grappling with a dilemma similar to what Baranczak would later face.
