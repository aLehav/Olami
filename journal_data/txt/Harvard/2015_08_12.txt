After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The former director of international public broadcaster Voice of America and two foreign correspondents will join the Kennedy School of Government's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy as fellows this fall, the center announced Tuesday.
The three Joan Shorenstein fellows—former Voice of America director David Ensor, Lima bureau chief for Agence France Presse Marie Sanz, and BBC foreign correspondent Paul Wood—will research and publish a paper on a media- or policy-related topic while at Harvard. They join veteran CBS reporter and retired “Face the Nation” moderator Bob Schieffer, who will be in residence at least twice a semester until December 2016 as the school’s third Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy fellow.
According to the center’s fellows program manager, Katie Miles, the Joan Shorenstein fellows are chosen in a “highly selective” application process, while the Walter Shorenstein Fellows are selected by invitation at the discretion of the Shorenstein center director with input from the Kennedy School dean and the fellowship’s donors, Doug and Lydia Shorenstein.
Ensor, who has also served as the communications director for the U.S. embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, said he will focus on the topic of journalism and public diplomacy during his time at Harvard, examining how the U.S. can best communicate with the rest of the world.
“There are questions to be looked at about how you reach people, how you communicate with people, and then there are questions about what the message should be,” Ensor said. “We’re in the era of Russia Today and CCTV and PressTV in Iran—these are real challenges, how to respond to some of the often inaccurate information that is on them and widely disseminated.”
Wood, on the other hand, said he will examine moral dilemmas facing journalists in Syria, particularly when covering news related to the militant group that calls itself the Islamic State.
“In covering ISIS, you come up against all sorts of questions about how far you can go as a journalist, what you do to protect your sources, what you do to protect people who might be affected by your stories, where your duty lies,” Wood said.
Sanz, who reported on former Cuban President Fidel Castro’s final years in power, said she will write about the “changing relations between Cuba and the U.S. through the lens of the media.” The U.S. and Cuban governments restored diplomatic relations last month, the latest development in the so-called “Cuban Thaw.”
“This is for me really a time to think slowly about all the issues that I’ve covered, the way the world has changed,” Sanz added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Svetlana Boym, a Slavic and Comparative Literature professor whom colleagues remember as an avid writer and artist whose work was known around the world for its transformative power, died Aug. 5 after a battle with cancer. She was 56.
Boym, who was born in the former Soviet Union and studied Hispanic languages and literatures at the Leningrad’s Herzen Pedagogical Institute, went on to receive a master’s degree and Ph.D. from Boston University and Harvard, respectively. As a member of Harvard’s Faculty, Boym specialized in Russian and comparative literature, with a focus on aesthetics, philosophy, and literature.
In addition to her work teaching at Harvard, Boym was a prolific scholar and artist, such as through her work as a photographer and playwright. Her work has been featured across the world, from Ljubljana, Slovenia, to Cambridge, with a recent project displayed at the Venice Architectural Biennial in 2010.
“She was known around the world,” said Justin M. Weir, the chair of Harvard’s Slavic Languages and Literatures department.
Julie A. Buckler, a professor who taught both Slavic and comparative literature alongside Boym,
said her late colleague’s work “transformed humanity.”
“I admired the way she combined academic and artistic interests,” Buckler said. “It was a marker of how deeply creative she was.”
“She produced so much work, and so much of it so distinctive and important,” she added.
During her tenure at Harvard, Boym received Guggenheim and American Academy in Berlin fellowships, as well as the Everett Mendelsohn Excellence in Mentoring Award in 2009. Former students remember the late professor as an empathetic role model.
Boym’s work and mentorship, former graduate student Julia Vaingurt said, inspired students to follow and admire her like “groupies.”
“Sometimes, a sense of mastery over an area or a subject propels one to approach it from the position of distance and superiority,” said Vaingurt, who studied under Boym. “Svetlana never fell into this trap... She was always generous to the objects of her study, illuminating their thought and work in the most caressing light.”
Boym’s legacy, colleagues say, will go far. “She left us way too soon, but she left a very significant legacy,” Buckler said. “She has already influenced many people, and I’m sure that her work will continue to be important and influential for a long time.”
Boym is survived by her husband, Dana Villa.
Boym was remembered at a memorial service for in Brookline last week. Harvard’s Slavic and Comparative Literature departments plan to hold another memorial during the school year.
