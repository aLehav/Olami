After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each semester follows a natural progression from shopping week to midterms to final exams. Grades submitted at the end of each semester thus deliver not only academic feedback but also a sense of resolution to each learning experience. This year—the second year after reforming the academic calendar to place exams before winter break—the administration delayed the official deadline for submitting grades. The grade deadline changed from four days after the final examination to Jan. 3 for all classes. Despite this definite date, grades for some classes trickled in well past the deadline.
This decision to allow professors to submit grades up through the second business day after winter break—an unofficial policy last year—was ultimately short-sighted and unfair. Most importantly, students applying for fellowships, jobs, grad programs, and internships should be able to submit as complete an account of their grades as possible with their application, for the sake of everyone involved.
We sympathize with the fact that the original policy forced professors of classes with later exams to grade during the holiday season, a time that they may wish to spend with their families. That said, grades should be due four business days after the final exam in a class or after classes end in a class without exams—even if the Registrar is closed between exams and the beginning of the new academic year.
As employees of the college, professors are obligated to return grades on time, and, frankly, there should be more accountability from the faculty side of things. Just as students are required to return essays in a timely manner—barring emergencies—the teaching staff of each course should also be required to provide the courtesy of academic feedback. After all, students struggled with compressed schedules under the new calendar, bearing the load without accommodations from the administration, and professors should do the same.
Additionally, there should also be a proper incentive structure with regard to the Q Guide. Certain irregularities—such as students receiving their grades who did not fill out the Q in time or those who did not receiving their grades any earlier—should be ironed out. Without a standardized method of motivation to fill out course evaluations, the university loses credibility and unintentionally encourages people to boycott the Q Guide, a mutually advantageous resource for professors and potential students alike.
Also, insufficient coordination with the Registrar has presumably compounded the problem. As students attempted to the access their grades on the deadline for grades and long afterwards, the Online Student Record Tool was down for extended periods. We believe that in order to properly handle the situation, I.T. should have had more manpower dedicated to the registrar’s I.T. system.
In general, professors should be more conscientious about returning academic work. While a punctual final grade may be the most visible, direct method of academic feedback, the end of a course necessitates full academic disclosure. When considering the educational impact of a semester’s worth of learning, just a transcript grade pales in comparison to actually viewing your corrected exam or your final with comments. Although of course some professors readily meet with students from the previous semester to discuss the final exam, term paper, or final project, this should not be left up to a particular professor’s discretion. Indeed, there should be formally instituted procedure that sets deadlines for emailing out comments and responses on a course’s final assessments as well as a more general academic deadline.
At a base level, Harvard is an institution of higher learning. According to its stated institutional goals, “education at Harvard should liberate students to explore, to create, to challenge, and to lead.” Although less romantic, such lofty aspirations can only be realized through proper closure to the academic experience from both sides of the classroom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We are going to the bottom of this,” said President Obama, just hours after the tragedy in Arizona this January. He then ordered Bob Mueller, the current director of the FBI, to help coordinate the investigation of the shooting and suspect, Jared Loughner.  The intentions of the President and the government of Arizona were in the right place; this type of incident cleary mandates inquiry, but tracing through the most recent mass shootings and their subsequent investigations reveals that little is learned that is helpful in preventing future lethal episodes. Instead, what comes out of each investigation is a collection of fateful ‘warning signs’ that were not put together by either parents, schools, or close friends leading up to the crimes. Taken together, they form a pattern that serves a disheartening point: our ability to predict violence is extremely low.
Similar to the aftermath of Loughner’s shooting, when Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people and took his own life on the campus of Virginia Tech in 2007, the Governor of Virginia ordered a full-scale investigation into the life of Cho and the incident itself. What came out of that report was evidence of a checkered personal history, inadequate communication between Cho’s therapists and teachers, and the ease with which Cho was able to acquire firearms (by state law it was actually illegal for him to do so). A few mistakes were revealed, such as how police and security personnel could have better handled the shooting while it was taking place, but regarding the signs that this man would commit such deeds, the report wrote: “Cho's writings and videotaped pronouncements do not explain why he struck when and where he did.”
Likewise, the two high school students that killed 12 of their classmates and one teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 provide another example of how those close to the killers were unable to notice anything amiss. Investigations of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the Columbine High seniors that committed the massacre, uncovered that the two had been planning such events for over or a month, but even their parents had no idea anything of that nature or scale would take place. There are many high school students that are removed, play violent video games, and do not shoot their classmates. Filmmaker Michael Moore titled his documentary “Bowling for Columbine” because the two boys allegedly went bowling the morning of the shooting. Sadly, that fact accentuates the notion that people who do unthinkable things often act incredibly normally leading up to these events.
And so it is with Loughner. Evidence suggests that this was most likely a premeditated killing; Loughner had written personal notes that mentioned Representative Giffords’ name, and video footage of the shooting showed that Loughner was wearing ear plugs. But did Loughner exhibit traits that those close to him simply missed? Hardly; there are many people whose stories are quite similar to his: high school dropouts, talented musicians, marijuana smokers, and those who are mentally ill though not necessarily violent.
Our hindsight may appear 20-20 now, but these sad stories demonstrate that our foresight is close to legally blind. Obama said in his weekly video address following the shooting that “we have to keep our people safe, and see to it that the American dream remains vibrant and alive for our children and our grandchildren.” To this point, ordering investigations has not made our people any safer, but rather informs us how difficult it is to spot such tragedies before they take place.
Investigations of this sort, whether they are ordered because they are politically benign, or because they appear to be appropriate responses to such actions, do not help us from preventing future actions from taking place. What seems to elude the investigators, or does not grab as much ink as the killers’ mental faculties, is each one’s ability to possess guns. It is that act of each killer’s history that made him lethal.

Haiti has, since the January 2010 earthquake, been promised substantial foreign aid, namely in the form of money from donor countries such as the United States and Canada. However, the events that have transpired over the last few days demand a more lasting and different type of foreign aid- not financial but moral.
On Sunday afternoon, a relic of Haiti’s darkest days exposed the scars of a country already in a dire political situation. Jean-Claude Duvalier, also known by the moniker “Baby Doc,” arrived in Haiti from Paris on a diplomatic passport. As a man whose dictatorship was responsible for brutal and atrocious crimes against humanity, his arrival was met with a flood of questions, most of which are still unanswered.
The simplest of them all, is perhaps, “Why is he here?” The man behind some of the worst human rights abuses known by the Haitian people justified his presence like this: “I want to assess the situation in Haiti…I want to help rebuild my country.” Maybe Jean-Claude Duvalier would like to regain his old seat in power; maybe he wants to be part of the dialogue in Haiti’s reconstruction. Whatever it may be, to not hold him accountable for his overwhelmingly reprehensible offenses would be an affront to justice and moral consciousness. Even more absurd is the lack of any rationale by the international community to refrain from indicting him on charges that warrant the weighty scrutiny of a tribunal such as the International Court of Justice (ICC).
The Nuremberg Trials, known by many as proceedings that prosecuted members of the leadership in Nazi Germany, was the impetus for the creation of a permanent international court to deal with the atrocities of the type committed against Jews during the Holocaust and needless to say, a trial of a similar nature needs to be held in Jean-Claude Duvalier's case. The ICC, an oft-criticized institution, should seize this opportunity to prove its efficacy by not reneging its purpose.
The Duvaliers (Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier and son) and their cronies, it has been estimated, are responsible for close to 30,000 Haitian deaths during their 29 years in power. Equally shocking is the Haitian government's decision to merely charge Jean-Claude Duvalier with corruption, theft, and misappropriation of funds. The international community once overlooked the Duvaliers' crimes and it seems as if it will once again turn a blind eye.
However, it would be a grave mistake on the part of the international community to not enforce justice. There is no moral alternative. The ICC should apprehend and appropriately charge “Baby Doc” for his role in the deaths of thousands of Haitians.  As defined by the Rome Statute of the ICC Explanatory Memorandum, crimes against humanity are “particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity…part of a government policy or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or de facto authority.” If this definition does not accurately describe the Duvalier regimes, it’s a shrouded mystery as to what does. Prosecuting Jean-Claude Duvalier is exactly the foreign aid that Haiti needs from the international community at this time.
Aid of this type, at this very moment, will snatch Haiti out of this most unnecessary distraction when it should be focusing most of its effort, if not all, on rebuilding its collapsed infrastructure and stabilizing its crippled political system. Moreover, it will begin the healing of wounded Haitians, exhausted from unending abuses and corruption, which are part and parcel of a string of ineffective governments.
It has been a quarter century since Jean-Claude Duvalier left Haiti. Exiled to France and free from custody, “Baby Doc” has not been held accountable for any of the crimes he has committed. The price to pay for nearly three decades of senseless killings, rapes, and tortures is beyond imagination but justice must prevail.
The world's lien on Jean-Claude Duvalier’s future starts with a trial under the auspices of the ICC. As to why Jean-Claude Duvalier is in Haiti, this question can be left to speculation, but tough questions relating to his brutal regime as dictator of Haiti must have their rightful place in an international court of law.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since Harvard placed the Q Guide between eager students and their grades, evaluation participation has skyrocketed. With many classes seeing response levels above 90 percent, the Q guide seems to have become a far more valuable resource for those furiously shopping for classes. Students are now able to gain wisdom from former class enrollees and are endowed with gems of knowledge such as: “LifeSci 1b is the worst course I have ever taken, and if you have any respect for yourself and your sanity at all, you will not enroll in this course. It sets a new standard and performs as a paradigm for exactly how dreadful a class can possibly be.”
In many ways, the Q guide serves as an exclusive Ratemyprofessor.com, a website that few Harvard students take much stock in. Indeed, for some, the Q is akin to a Harvard bible. However, the Q is cueing students to fixate on the wrong particulars of a given course.
While student advice is no doubt helpful to consider when choosing classes, the first thing a student should consider is not a number but rather their own strengths, weaknesses, and interests. It is not uncommon to hear a student say, “I’m shopping that class. It got a 4.2 on the Q.” What about shopping a class because it is genuinely intriguing? These days, it seems that the Q has become so powerful that it encourages students to focus less on what they’re actually interested in and more on highly subjective and, it must be said, irrelevant numbers, not to mention the often unconstructive (and sometimes hilarious) student commentary. Additionally, the Q fails to account for courses that have been revamped and modified, perhaps based on the very responses the evaluation garnered the previous year.
This also raises the question of whom the Q guide is actually for. A professor is probably unlikely to gain much feedback from a response such as the one disgruntled LifeSci 1b student gave: “How much of your soul are you willing to cut out and sacrifice to your pre-med vision?” Even assigning a number to enthusiasm and effectiveness seems to be entirely subjective, depending on which student is asked.
Naturally, the anonymity the Internet provides on a site like Ratemyprofessor.com extends to the Q guide, which has obvious ostensible advantages. Without knowing who gave the comment, however, all context is removed. There is no way to know anything about the source—what year the student was, how much they know about the subject, if they ever went to class or studied, or if, say, the commenting student was destined to hate any class that required a paper longer than six pages or any sort of math that includes more than one variable. In more than one class, Q comments often blatantly contradict each other. One person, for instance, might claim that the class is impossible if one hasn’t taken Ec10, but the very next comment might advise that no economic knowledge is necessary whatsoever. 
Harvard encourages some level of individuality when it comes to learning—offering designable tutorials and a wide variety of options when it comes to fulfilling Gen Ed requirements. Yet, the Q guide fails to encourage students to think critically and constructively about their individual interests and learning style.
In just about every class there is a student who loves it, one who hates it, one who was overwhelmed, or one who has been studying the subject for years and could do the work with their eyes closed. The only way for a student to know what category he or she falls into is to try it.

When you rent a book off Chegg.com, the company plants a tree in your honor. Similarly, when you buy a book from the Coop, they give you a red and white bag to compensate for the 70 percent markup they offer. According to Chegg’s friendly website, writing in books is not allowed, but limited highlighting is acceptable. To rent, you simply enter into an agreement with the company to send the book back through UPS at the end of the term. For those wary of anything requiring shipping and handling, used books from the Coop are another reasonable option, and about the same price as a new one from Amazon. A new Coop book, however, should be avoided at all costs, especially the high one you’ll have to pay for it. If you’re looking for an alternative, the slightly more indie Harvard Book Store sometimes has an edge on price, but finding what you need is more do-it-yourself than at the Coop. And if you’re shying away from paperbacks, the Coop and Amazon both sell e-books, sending content directly to your Nook or Kindle. Streaming books onto your Kindle is ultimately more cost-effective, but could also lead to you becoming “that kid in section,” with all the gadgets. To avoid any academic or financial faux pas, check out FM’s guide to book prices and get your money’s worth of literature, calc study guides, and more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A powdery substance was discovered in the Science Center at approximately 3:27 p.m. on Sunday, according to the Harvard University Police Department log.
The Cambridge Fire Department was called to remove the substance for analysis.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not provide further information about where the substance was found because the incident remains under investigation.
“The substance is in the custody of the CFD to be tested,” Catalano wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson. “Until those tests come back we can’t confirm what the substance was or was not.”
According to John B. Mathers, assistant director of the Science Center, whenever anyone finds a suspicious package of a similar nature, the individual is encouraged to alert the police department.
The police then deem whether the substance is “suspicious” and refer the case to the fire department’s hazardous substance team for removal, Mathers said.
In this particular incident, HUPD identified the substance as a “suspicious package” and called the Cambridge Fire Department, who will see to its testing.
This kind of testing can take several weeks.
Louis Albanese, a business development manager for a laboratory testing company unrelated to the case, explained that his company has a minimum 10-day turnaround for routine chemical testing.
Exova, which has contracts with fire departments in its vicinity, may even take up to two to three weeks for investigating an unknown substance, Albanese said.

After suffering from a stroke last month, the Reverend Peter J. Gomes is recovering and hoping to return to his role overseeing Memorial Church by the end of the semester, according to a Memorial Church spokesperson and friends who have visited him in the hospital.
Gomes, who is currently residing at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, is able to walk and speak clearly despite having suffered from some paralysis, said friend and Harvard Divinity School Professor Emeritus Preston N. Williams.
Gomes—who has overseen the Memorial Church for over three and a half decades—is doing well, according to Williams, who added that Gomes still possesses his sense of humor.
“He’s getting better and stronger everyday and he’s in good spirits,” said longtime friend and Memorial Church Minister Dorothy A. Austin, who has visited him in the hospital. “His mind is still that great mind that it always was.”
The members of the congregation at Memorial Church are anxiously awaiting Gomes’ return and receive bulletins and updates on his progress, Austin said.
“He’s very much loved and missed,” she said. “There is a palpable feeling that we are very much in this together.”
According to Austin, if Gomes is able to return by the end of the semester, his homecoming would likely coincide with Easter. Gomes would especially look forward to delivering the holiday sermon, Austin added.
“It will be a triumphant moment when he returns to the church,” she said. “I think the church will be overflowing.”
Gomes, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, had previously announced plans to retire in 2012 after 40 years at Harvard.
“He’s been a brilliant preacher and has carried the Memorial Church and the heart of the College for decades now,” Austin said.
Since Gomes arrived at Harvard, he has become a prominent figure both on campus and on the national stage, swearing in both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.
“He is an excellent person and 150 percent devoted to Harvard and Memorial Church and to the larger community,” Williams said.
Gomes’ course Religion 1513: “History of Harvard and Its Presidents” will continue this semester despite his absence, said the instructor who will be teaching it, Stephen P. Shoemaker.
Gomes’ weekly Wednesday teas, where students and faculty alike are invited to the Reverend’s home for treats and conversation, have continued in his absence.

A bill filed today by two Massachusetts state legislators could require Harvard University to publicly disclose more detailed financial reports, including property and investment values.
The bill seeks to increase the transparency of private colleges and universities in the wake of serious endowment losses during the recent recession.
Harvard, which suffered an almost 30 percent loss of its endowment during the crisis, was forced to make significant budget cuts which led to layoffs and the suspension of construction underway in Allston.
This bill was sponsored by state Senator Patricia D. Jehlen of Somerville and Representative Michael J. Moran of Brighton, who are both Democrats.
According to the language of the bill, schools with investments or property valued at more than $10 million must report the value of their assets starting in 2013.
Harvard will also be required to list all federal, state, and local taxes from which it is tax-exempt.
According to Harvard University spokesperson John D. Longbrake, the University is currently reviewing this bill as well as others filed yesterday, particularly those relating to higher education and research institutions.
“[We] look forward to working with Representative Moran and others as the legislative process unfolds in the coming months,” Longbrake wrote in an e-mail.
The bill would also require colleges and universities to reveal details about their contracts with outside companies and about individual employees’ salaries.
For example, Harvard would have to report all the salaries and names of employees or consultants who are paid more than $250,000.
Service providers who are paid $150,000 or more must also be disclosed, along with any donations made by that company.
The bill also seeks to shed light on any conflicts of interest of board members.
Trustees and members of Harvard’s governing bodies would have to disclose any financial transactions between the school and the trustee or the trustee’s family members.
According to the Boston Globe, the bill drew from a report published last year by the Center for Social Philanthropy that criticized Harvard and Dartmouth for risky investment strategies.
The report was partially funded by the Service Employees International Union, which represents some Harvard staff and also lobbied for the new law.

President Obama’s State of the Union address last night touched upon several issues that are likely to affect the University, including the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, funding for science research and technology, and the DREAM Act.
In his speech, which favored breadth over specifics, Obama managed to maintain a strong presence as a leader but the challenge will be implementing his proposals, professors said.
Barbara L. Kellerman, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that she felt Obama was able to do what he needed to in order to reassert his authority.
“Tonight he was the central figure that Americans have historically looked to, which was not the case for most of 2010,” Kellerman said.
Obama emphasized the importance of education, science scholarship, and technology, calling these pursuits “our generation’s Sputnik moment.”
Government and Sociology Professor Theda R. Skocpol said she felt his
“call to build American competitiveness” with countries such as China and India was a much needed vote of confidence in the country.
In light of Obama’s emphasis on improving education, professors said that they were not concerned that Harvard, which receives significant federal funding for its research projects, would be adversely effected by the partial five-year spending freeze that the President proposed last night.
Obama also called for colleges and universities to open their doors to  ROTC after the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” in what some professors said they felt was a powerful message to the University.
“That was delivered right to Harvard,” said Kennedy School lecturer Elaine C. Kamarck.
Harvard and other universities have previously barred ROTC from their campuses because “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” violated their non-discrimination policies.
Though University President Drew G. Faust has recently said she welcomes the military’s return to campus, it remains unclear if ROTC will be reinstalled at Harvard.
“There is nothing more symbolically important than Harvard getting ROTC back,” added Kamarck. “The preeminent university in the country should have ROTC.”
Obama also discussed immigration reform and the politics of the DREAM Act—a bill which would extend a path to citizenship for undocumented minors—without mentioning it by name.
The president’s decision to speak vaguely about this legislation, for which Faust has been a major advocate, may have been an effort to diffuse partisan tension in the room, Kamarck said, considering that the speech comes close on the heels of the Tucson shooting.
The recent tragedy shadowed the event, resulting in a more subdued atmosphere, Kellerman said.
She noted that there was less loud cheering, and that members of Congress seemed to be more “genteel” and “cordial” than in previous years.
Though Republican and Democratic members of Congress sat side by side last night, several professors agreed that the recent push for civility and bipartisanship might be short-lived.
“I think we’re headed towards continued partisan entanglement and opposition,” Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 said.
However, the effort to tone down political rhetoric may have resulted in a speech that was less powerful than others Obama has given.
“Nothing is going to linger in the history books,” Kellerman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students gathered everywhere—from suite common rooms to the Institute of Politics—to hear President Obama’s annual State of the Union address last night, which touched on many topics directly affecting undergraduates, including education reform and the reinstatement of Reserve Officers’ Training Corps on college campuses.
Students said that they thought the speech’s tone inspired young people to get involved with their community in order to make a difference.
“The speech spoke to larger issues calling on all of us to dream big,” said Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, president of the Institute of Politics. “It was a message that Harvard students can take to heart, especially the sections about the entrepreneurial spirit, which is something that I think Harvard students have really adopted.”
Many students said they were particularly moved by the President’s strong emphasis on the importance of education and quality educators to the future of the nation.
“I appreciated his focus on science and technology, and was encouraged to do research and to look for ways to find a career in teaching science after college,” said Jenny Ye ’13.
Students also said they felt that the President’s message about the urgent need for education reform was one that could cross party lines, despite the divisive rhetoric of politics today.
“I think that’s a goal we can all be proud of, regardless of our political affiliations.” said Gabriel S. Neustadt ’13, communications director for the IOP.
The President’s call for colleges to reinstate ROTC with the official repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” also resonated strongly with students, as the absence of the program at Harvard has been widely debated.
“I appreciated his call for colleges to bring ROTC back to campuses, as this is something that [the Harvard Republican Club] has worked hard on in the past,” said HRC President Michael W. McLean ’12.
Despite their concerns about President Obama’s previous policies, HRC members said they felt the President was also putting forth ideas that Republicans in Congress would be able to support, such as lowering the corporate tax rate.
Regardless of their political opinions, students expressed reservations about whether President Obama will ultimately be able to pass legislation based on the ideas put forth in yesterday’s address, especially given the polarized nature of the current Congress.
“There were a lot of areas he mentioned that Republicans and Democrats can work together on, but it depends on whether the President wants to find common ground,” said McLean.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a historic move, the Harvard University Library will begin sharing its approximately 17 million volumes with the seven other members of the Ivy League.
The decision comes nearly 10 years after the rest of the Ivy League began participating in the interlibrary sharing system Borrow Direct.
While library and University administrators said the decision would greatly expand the resources available to members of the Harvard community, some professors said they were leery the new policy might take too many Harvard books off Harvard’s bookshelves.
“One has to have some concerns, insofar as Harvard is more likely to be a net lender than a borrower,” said Jeffrey F. Hamburger, who chaired a Faculty of Arts and Sciences library advisory committee. “That said, there are areas in which other libraries have stronger collections than we do, and I think time will tell whether it’s the right decision.”
The move to enter the book-sharing agreement—which will make more than 45 million volumes available to the Harvard community—comes after a major administrative overhaul of Harvard’s libraries that consolidated them under a single director.
While Harvard has shared its collection with MIT since April of last year, this decision greatly expands the pool of research institutes that have access to the Harvard University Library—the largest academic library system in the world. With this agreement, MIT will also be joining the Borrow Direct program.
University Professor Robert C. Darnton ’60, who served as Director of the Harvard University Library before the administrative restructuring, praised the final adoption of Borrow Direct—which promises the delivery of books in four business days or fewer.
“The great appeal of Borrow Direct is its directness: books come right to readers with no hassle or delays,” Darnton wrote in an e-mail.
“And as the libraries collectively represent vast holdings, students and faculty at Harvard can tap resources that are even greater than the 17 million volumes in their home library,” he added.
Some professors expressed concern that the decision could be used as a justification for the Harvard University Library to limit the expansion of its collection in order to reduce costs.
Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages Peter B. Machinist ’66 said that he was unsure whether cost-cutting was the primary reason for the agreement, but said he thought it was a factor.
Machinist cautioned that Harvard would not remain a “viable research institute” if it does not continue to maintain its extensive collection.
“Our first priority has to be to service ourselves before we service others,” he said.
Hamburger, a History of Art and Architecture professor, said he thought Harvard’s libraries have “really suffered badly in the past decade or more.”
Library and University administrators said the sharing agreement would not drain Harvard’s collections, asserting that the Borrow Direct software program balances sharing responsibilities between participating library systems.
“In 2009, Dartmouth Library, one of the two smallest libraries participating in BD, was the biggest lender,” Associate Librarian of Collection Management for Harvard College Library Marilyn Wood wrote in a statement.
“That indicates that the size of the collection doesn’t necessarily predict the demand,” wrote Wood, who will manage the Borrow Direct project.
The Yale University Library, now the second largest library in the consortium, borrowed 30,763 volumes and loaned 20,633 in the 2010 fiscal year, according to Yale Associate University Librarian Kendall Crilly, who manages Yale’s Borrow Direct program.
Like Dartmouth College’s library, Brown University Library—one of the smaller library systems—has been a net lender.
But still, “Our faculty and students have been very happy with Borrow Direct and have come to rely on it,” Brown University Head of Circulation and Resource Sharing Bart Hollingsworth said.
Harvard has looked to partner with Borrow Direct for a number of years, according to Executive Director of the Harvard University Library Helen Shenton.
According to Director of MIT Libraries Ann J. Wolpert—who worked at the Harvard Business School Library in the 1990s—until last summer, Harvard did not have the technological infrastructure to support the software platform that Borrow Direct used.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The faculty of the Harvard Business School has unanimously voted to significantly modify their decades-old curriculum, as a result partly of studies conducted by Professors Srikant M. Datar and David A. Garvin ’74 to examine the effectiveness of current business education practices.
The first-year “required curriculum” program, which includes courses in finance and management, will be augmented in fall 2011 with a new program entitled Field Immersion Experiences for Leadership Development (FIELD).
The new program’s goal is to provide students with the opportunity to apply what they’ve learned in class to working with businesses and industries abroad, according to Business School spokesperson Brian C. Kenny.
As part of the revised curriculum, students will work in small groups to build leadership and communication skills. Subsequently, they will be randomly assigned to a country not of their origin where they will work at a local company. Students will also apply what they have learned in a project on campus.
The new curriculum was motivated by a desire “to respond to the need for leaders in a more complex world,” Kenny said.
“The program is meant to complement class-based case methods, allowing students an opportunity to put all of that learning to work,” he said.
In addition to the FIELD program, the school’s second-year “elective curriculum” calendar will be “modularized” by splitting semesters into quarters to allow students to take a broader array of courses.
“The purpose of the calendar changes is to give faculty members more latitude to innovate in their classes,” Kenny said. “The reason we decided to do that is because we’ve heard from faculty that they are eager to do things that are more experiential.”
But he added that the details of the program are not yet set in stone.
“We’re really looking at FIELD as a platform to create future innovations from,” Kenny said. “We hope to create leaders who have both confidence and character and will make a positive impact on the world.”
According to Business School Student Association Co-Presidents Brett C. Gibson and Justine K. Lelchuk, the changes to the curriculum have been met with positive reactions from across the student body.
“Students on the whole have responded very positively to the new programs,” Gibson said. “In fact, some students who are here say they wish they could start over again to take advantage of the changes.”
Professors and other faculty members have made it their top priority in recent months to attain feedback from students who might have had questions about the policy changes, according to Gibson and Lelchuk.
“They’ve been consistently seeking feedback from students and have asked the Student Association to gain perspective on students’ opinions of the changes,” Lelchuk said. “Faculty chairs are holding sections for each of the first-year classes to gain feedback. They want it to be a highly integrative process.”
Lelchuk added that even though she and her fellow second-years won’t be able to take part in the newly created programs, they’re grateful for the opportunity to play such an integral role in their development.
“We’re really excited and thrilled to have been a part of the innovation period,” Lelchuk said. “We’re definitely looking forward to see what becomes of the new curriculum in the coming years.”

This article has been modified to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: JAN. 26, 2011  
An earlier version of the Jan. 26 article "HBS Revitalizes Curriculum" incorrectly stated that the most recent round of curriculum reforms would “drastically modify” and supplant the current first-year MBA curriculum. In fact, the reforms, according to HBS officials, come as a complement to and enhancement of the current curriculum. Additionally, the story incorrectly stated that the FIELD curriculum would divide the first year into thirds when, in fact, the first-year curriculum will still be divided into two terms, with three new pilot programs spread throughout the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Winter just might be the best sports season for an Ivy League fan. To start, if you want to keep dexterity in your fingers and toes, there just aren’t a whole lot of options for outdoor fun. But maybe more importantly, the Ancient Eight’s winter teams can compete on a national level. Harvard’s women’s squash tops the national rankings, as does Yale’s men’s hockey team (we need not discuss that any more), and men’s basketball doesn’t look too bad either. And as we’ll show you in a little chat Around the Water Cooler, we have an exciting few days ahead of us.
After the Cornell men’s basketball team’s run to the Sweet Sixteen during March Madness last year, something dawned on Ivy League sports fans: the Ancient Eight’s guaranteed spot in the Big Dance is no longer a meaningless gesture. Nope. The Ivy League can play.
And so, that lone tournament berth holds more promise this year than in recent memory. With eight Ivy League matchups in men’s basketball over the weekend, the hunt for the league title begins in earnest this weekend.
Princeton hosts Brown and Yale Friday and Saturday nights, respectively, to kick off its Ivy League season. The Tigers have had a strong campaign so far, boasting a 12-4 record, with two of those losses coming against ranked teams: Duke and Central Florida (which Princeton nearly beat). The Tigers should make a strong push for the league crown.
But the Crimson looks strong as well. At 13-3 overall, Harvard hasn’t lost a game at home and is currently on a six-game winning streak, which includes two league victories against Dartmouth. In fact, the Crimson’s play earned it a vote in the AP Poll for the first time this year and the third in as many seasons. Harvard will look to accrue more votes this weekend, as the men face off against Columbia and Cornell at Lavietes Pavilion.
While men’s basketball might get more attention, other Ivy League sports teams certainly compete on a national level as well. No sport proves that better than squash, with Ancient Eight teams occupying four of the top five spots in the women’s rankings, and four of the top six in the men’s.
But, the No. 1 Trinity College men’s squad has been securely at the top of the charts for over a decade now, not having dropped a match since 1998. No. 6 Harvard will try to change that on Feb. 9, as the two squads face off at the Barnaby Courts. Meanwhile, the No. 1 Harvard women will try to keep their unbeaten streak going against No. 3 Trinity.
And the Ancient Eight isn’t too bad at Lacrosse, either. After nine Ivy Leaguers were selected in Major League Lacrosse’s Supplemental draft, two more were taken in this past Friday’s 2011 MLL draft. With the 27th overall pick, the Denver Outlaws selected Princeton’s Jack McBride, and two rounds later, the Boston Cannons took Brown midfielder David Hawley.
McBride led a solid Princeton attack last year, scoring 35 goals en route to earning an honorable mention for the All-America team. For the Bears, Hawley found the back of the net 27 times in the 2010 campaign, earning him a spot on the All-Ivy first team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Picture this: the top crews in the world flying through the last 500 meters of the world championships, when an underdog takes control of the race. The spectators—wearing shorts and t-shirts, because it’s Florida—gaze in amazement with one thought going through their heads: “Are you serious?”
That line, of course, delivered by Dick Vitale, who is not only a legendary announcer, but also a Sarasota, Fla. resident.
This vision could become a reality. The Sunshine State’s counties of Sarasota and Manatee have entered a bid to host the 2017 World Rowing Championships.
After a week of training in the area, I can’t imagine why anyone wouldn’t want to go.
From the moment of our arrival, we rowers were treated like rock stars. (To be fair, some members of our crowd, notably Harvard heavyweight coach Harry Parker, really are rowing royalty, but I certainly haven’t done anything in my life to merit celebrity treatment.) A large sign in the Sarasota airport read, “Welcome, Harvard Rowers,” and a similar one greeted us at the Hampton Inn, where we stayed for the duration of the trip. But the highlight of the trip was probably the picnic that was hosted for us, which included an appearance by Vitale. The announcer reflected on being rejected by Harvard despite his 1520 on the SAT.
“I never understand why they rejected me,” he said. “Maybe if I was a rower, I would’ve got in.”
It was all in good fun, of course.
What stood out most to me was how genuinely happy everyone was to have us rowing there. I doubt I’ll ever feel that important again.
And if these counties can make me feel that special, I can only imagine what they’d have in store for national team members.
My two-and-a-half years as a rower have led me to believe that rowing is largely a niche sport. It will always have its participants and fans, and when it is noticed, it is respected for its grueling nature. But in my—admittedly limited—experience, towns don’t tend to revolve around their crews. Philadelphia residents follow the Eagles, not Vesper or Penn AC.
But when you drive into Sarasota, you are greeted with a large sign that says, “Welcome to Sarasota: Future Home of World Class Rowing.”
And what was extremely impressive was the cooperation between the two counties in the development of their rowing facilities, as emcee Rick Piccolo noted at the official opening of the facility at Fort Hamer. In rowing, the counties saw the potential for business growth through sports tourism, and they worked in concert to get the job done.
“Great,” a lot of rowers are probably thinking, “but how’s the water?”
Actually, it’s fantastic.
Fort Hamer sits in the middle of a waterway perfect for long, steady-state rows and interval workouts, while Sarasota’s Nathan Benderson Park plays host to the race course. Currently shy of 2000 meters, the course will reach its full size after a highway is moved to accommodate it. I was one of the Radcliffe rowers lucky enough to row on the course itself. At the time I was too focused on my own rowing to gaze at the surroundings, but looking back on it, I can see how the course has the potential to produce a stadium-like atmosphere, particularly if the counties take advantage of the water’s low height and build some grandstands.
As St. Catharines, Ont., has demonstrated, grandstands transform crew from a sport that people admire from afar to one that people watch as closely as they do football or basketball—or perhaps even more closely because races are determined by such small margins.
But beyond grandstands—and a few more meters of water for racing)—Sarasota and Manatee counties really aren’t missing very much, especially if they could get Dick Vitale to announce their races. There’s not much overlap between the college basketball and rowing seasons; perhaps he’d be willing to break from his usual routine to provide commentary.
It doesn’t take a rowing expert to look at these counties’ potential and say, “It’s awesome, baby.”

Last season, it took the Harvard men’s volleyball team ten games to notch its first win of the year.
This season, it took one.
In its season opener last night at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Crimson (1-0) downed Newbury (2-5) in four sets, winning 3-1.
“It feels great, to be honest,” sophomore setter Rob Lothman said. “Last season it got to be pretty frustrating. So when you come out with a win, it sets a great tone for the season.”
Harvard relied heavily on its freshman class, starting four rookies in the contest. Any sign of first game jitters were hard to notice, as the four newcomers combined for 23 of the Crimson’s 42 kills and 12 of 22 digs.
Freshmen Kyle Rehkemper and Nick Madden held down the middle position, combining for three solo blocks and six block assists.
“I have to especially give a little shout out to our middles,” Lothman said. “They really played hard and they really owned the middle of the court today. I hope that’s something we keep seeing in the future.”
Rehkemper and Madden also got it done on offense, notching eight and seven kills, respectively.
“They bring a lot of size, and they both have great arms,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “I’m a big believer in that part of the offense. If we have a good middle attack, it helps everyone else out as well.”
But despite the strong performance of its newcomers, Harvard called on an old standby in the contest’s crucial points—junior co-captain Matt Jones.
Jones—who finished with a game high 15 kills—played an important role in sealing the victory for the Crimson.
With Harvard up 2-1 and leading 21-18 in the fourth set, Jones came up with a series of big plays to send the Nighthawks packing.
Jones ignited the run by taking a set from Lothman and finishing with a kill to make it 22-18. Jones notched another point on the following possession, stuffing a Newbury attacker.
With the Crimson two points away from victory, Nighthawks coach Chris Taylor signaled for a timeout, but it wouldn’t slow Jones.
On the next point, the outside hitter finished another set from Lothman for a kill, bringing Harvard within one. Newbury answered with a kill of its own to make it 24-20, but Jones sealed the win on the next point with his third straight kill. This time, Jones took a pass from Lothman on the outside and finished with a thunderous crosscourt spike.
“He got hot in that fourth game,” Baise said. “It’s what I’ve come to expect from Matt, and I think we’ll see a lot of that this season.”
“He’s the type of guy you rely on in close situations,” Lothman added. “Towards the end of the game, he really took the team on his back. He came over to me and said, ‘This is where we’re going to win this game. Give me the ball. I’m going to put it down.’”
Lothman also turned in a strong performance at setter, handing out a game-high 27 assists to go along with three digs and three kills.
“Our passing wasn’t great and that always makes his job tough,” Baise said. “But he was able to get the ball where we needed it to be, and that’s key at the setter position.”
Lothman played a crucial role in helping the Crimson grab the match’s first two sets.
Lothman gave Harvard its first lead early in the match, landing an ace on his second serve.
The Crimson fell back behind moments later, but took back the lead off an ace from Rehkemper. Harvard rolled from there, continuing on a 6-2 run to grab the 12-6 lead. The Crimson continued to extend its lead, going up 21-13 before eventually winning the set by six points.
Harvard gained the commanding two-set advantage in the second game, using a 6-2 run midway through the set to grab a four-point lead, 18-14. The Crimson’s advantage never dipped below three for the remainder of the set, and Harvard finished with a 25-18 win.
The third set was a different story.
Harvard fell behind early but managed to claw its way back into the game, taking a 16-15 lead off an ace from sophomore Derek Jansma. But Newbury regained the lead and claimed its first set, 25-20.
“It’s a long match and I think we just let our focus slip a little bit in that third game,” Lothman said.
Harvard regained focus for the fourth set, never trailed en route to a 25-20 win to seal the victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With more varsity teams competing for Harvard than any other NCAA Division 1 college in the country, it’s not surprising that there may be some sports with which you’re not familiar.
It wasn’t until my freshman year of high school that I was introduced to the beautiful game that is squash when a new friend asked me to watch her play in her first varsity game.
After watching a couple of matches, I decided I was ready to give playing a shot. Once I got over the initial claustrophobia that comes naturally with being trapped inside a box with a potentially crazy person, I attempted to serve the ball. Lesson No. 1: squash balls don’t bounce very well, especially if you haven’t hit them against the wall for a while.
I learned a lot more about the game in later lessons and have continued to do so in my time as a beat writer. But for someone like me who grew up watching football and basketball, watching a squash match sometimes feels like being transported to a completely different world. Squash players referee their teammates’ matches, adding a very interesting dynamic to each contest. Immediately following a tough matchup, players often have to work together with their opponents to call the next game.
When a team match is being played, the whole area is abuzz with squeaky shoes cutting across the wooden flooring and the smack of the ball hitting each and any of the walls. The hush—marred only by the sounds of other matches and a few gasps and brief comments—that usually engulfs viewers during points adds a different kind of intensity than what you see in most other sports. Only when the ball finally bounces twice or hits tin is the semi-silence broken with the louder claps and cheers usually associated with sporting events. As I’ve come to learn, there’s something really special about this hidden gem of a sport.
And it’s not just squash. This winter break, I had the pleasure of watching a cross-country ski race for the first time. And by “watching,” I mean that my ski buddies and I were almost trampled by a stampede of 15-20 high school girls breaking into last-second sprints in the direction of a looming finish line.
I’ve never been much of a skier, and it was my very first time on a cross-country trail. So when the racers’ path abruptly merged with ours, it was pretty terrifying. Concerned parents called out to the four unsuspecting skiers dawdling along the trail, and we quickly scrambled to the side and were able to observe the race to the finish.
My awkward stumbling across black-diamond trails earlier in the day (apparently those exist in cross-country skiing, too) gave me a newfound appreciation for the girls cruising with ease up the same slopes on which I spent nearly half an hour face-down in the snow. In retrospect, the encounter was a fortunate accident, especially because I was able to jump into a snow bank before any collisions could occur.
Students should make an effort to get to know Harvard’s lesser known athletic teams.
As a fall-sport athlete, I spend a lot of time in the winter and spring cross training, because, per Ivy League regulations, offseason interactions between players and coaches are severely limited. And the offseason has been the perfect time to experiment with new sports—at least once in a while—and gain a new appreciation for the different games people play on campus.
The world of sports is much more extensive than we often realize, and I would encourage you to go see some of the lesser-known sports teams play. Want to start now? Here’s a shameless plug for the sport I cover: Tonight, both the Harvard men’s and women’s squash teams host Trinity. The Crimson women and the Bantams men are both defending national champions and they hold the country’s current No. 1 rankings, so it’s sure to be a night of great squash all around.
Check out the matches if you have a chance, and maybe get into a game yourself (though you might want to wait until at least tomorrow for the latter). On a campus with 41 varsity teams, there’s no reason we shouldn’t learn a little something about all of them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men’s basketball team surges into the heart of conference play on a six-game win streak, the squad’s most famous alumnus, Jeremy Lin '10, is having quite the month of his own.
After struggling to find minutes behind the Golden State Warriors’ high-scoring backcourt of Monta Ellis and Stephen Curry, the guard was reassigned on Jan. 10 to the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Development League, where he immediately showed that his brief NBA experience had greatly improved his game.
“It’s a great opportunity…for me to come down, get a lot of playing time, and work on what I need to work on.” Lin recently told NBA.com. “The coaches, the GMs, they’re talking to me, telling me what I should improve on.”
On Jan. 15, Lin was named to the NBA D-League Showcase’s first team after averaging 21.5 points, 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 3.5 steals per game during the four-day, 16-game tournament in South Padre Island, Texas.
Of the players named to the heavily-scouted Showcase’s three teams, only Lin and 2010 NBA lottery-pick Cole Aldrich were NBA-assigned players.
The guard earned another accolade shortly thereafter, when he was named D-League Co-Performer of the Week, along with Bighorn teammate and former New York Knick Marcus Landry. Lin averaged 20.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 2.8 steals while leading the Bighorns to a 4-0 record for the week of Jan. 10-17.
The hot streak has continued recently for Lin, who followed up a 16-point, 7-rebound, 8-assist, 6-steal game Saturday with 21 points and 11 rebounds Sunday, both in losses to Iowa.
Despite playing on a team of former big-school college stars in Landry, Danny Green (North Carolina), Salim Stoudemire (Arizona), D.J. Strawberry (Maryland) and the recently-waived Nick Fazekas (Nevada), Lin leads the squad in scoring and is second in assists, proving that the NBA is where he really belongs.
“I know he can play and I think it was a phenomenal signing and still think it is,” Warriors majority owner Joe Lacob recently told csnbayarea.com’s Matt Steinmentz. “He’s getting better, gaining some confidence…I’m very happy.”
Lacob said his team received multiple recent trade offers for Lin, but he’s not biting.  Instead, Lacob has been so impressed with Lin’s play that he expressed confidence the guard would be with the Warriors next season, despite Lin’s non-guaranteed contract.
“I would think he’ll be on the team,” Lacob said. “We like Jeremy. We think he’s going to develop into a pretty good player.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week’s Associated Press Top 25 Men's College Basketball poll had a surprise entry in the Others receiving votes category. Along with Penn State, Duquesne, and Belmont, Harvard managed to receive a single vote in the poll, making it the third straight season and fourth in the past six that the Crimson has received a vote.
In previous years, the Washington Post’s John Feinstein—a friend of coach Tommy Amaker—has been the usual source of AP votes for Harvard.
But this time, the voter in question was none other than Pete Gilbert of WBAL-TV 11 in Baltimore. His ballot, which put the Crimson at No. 25, may be found here.
The Back Page spoke to Gilbert today to get the scoop on his decision.
“The couple of times that I have seen or read about Harvard, they’ve been doing very well, and so you know what, maybe this is a team that deserves a little pub, too,” the Maryland native said.
“Going through the process, this year in particular...the back end of the poll has been more tumultuous than ever. The last five, six teams in would then lose twice, or lose once. There’s been so much turnover, and so I just started digging a little deeper,” Gilbert said. “Looking at Harvard, and looking at the wins that it had over GWU, Colorado, and Boston College...BC—who I’ve had the chance to see play this year, and I think is a pretty good basketball team—that was a really good win.”
“When you can see a guy like Keith Wright not do well, but the team can still do well and get a quality win, that’s indicative of the depth and the quality of the team,” Gilbert added. “And so, in the end, I said, maybe I have to ignore the Ivy part...and recognize it’s a good basketball team.”
Gilbert has not seen the Crimson play this year in person, but don’t be surprised to see Harvard get a vote next week, too.
“The way I look at it with my poll is you have to be knocked out,” he said. “Someone has to prove to me that they are that much better than you. I didn’t view this as just a weekly token thing. This week, I thought the way they were playing and looking at everybody else, I thought they were one of the top 25 teams in the country.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nordic skier Alena Tofte was a rookie on the rise last season, a talented athlete with a knack for big finishes, which she displayed at last year's Dartmouth Winter Carnival when she surged to 14th place in the last leg of the race.
This year Tofte has taken the next step. With an eighth-place finish in last weekend's 10k race at the TD Bank Eastern Cup and a 15th-place finish the weekend before at the Colby Carnival, the sophomore has demonstrated that she can consistently hold her own with some of the best racers in the region.
Earlier this year, Nordic coach Chris City '94 pointed out that Tofte's offseason training allowed her to come back more powerful than she had been before. That power helped the sophomore earn a second-place finish in the 1k Classic event at the USCan Cup at Forêt Montmorency last November, and her training has continued to pay off in the collegiate carnivals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After drafting Kwaku Nyamekye '10 a little over a year ago, the Columbus Crew finally signed the former Harvard standout this past Monday.
“We needed to add depth in that central position in the back, and he is a player who can provide it for us," Crew coach Robert Warzycha told reporters.
The two stars of 2009-10’s NCAA tournament-qualifying Crimson team, Nyamekye and Andre Akpan '10 took fairly different routes to the MLS following their shared college experience.
Akpan, the first runner-up for the Hermann Trophy, was drafted in the second round by the Colorado Rapids as the 22nd overall pick. The forward graduated early in order to begin his professional career.
Nyamekye, on the other hand, chose to stay in Cambridge to finish up his final semester. After commencement, the defender trained part-time with the Crew, and his performance seems to have been enough to earn him a contract. The Crew’s website and an article in the Miami Herald note that Nyamekye's contract is multi-year, while another source makes no such claim and adds that the defender will have to compete for a spot on the roster.
Nyamekye earned All-Ivy honors all four years, including first-team nods his junior and senior years. The Geneva, Switzerland, native was honored as the team's Most Valuable Player in his senior season.

What was once just a counter-service bakery and café has transformed into a marketplace with new fresh meal options and services.
Au Bon Pain now features several stations, including a salad bar, soup bar, and coffee station, in a newly remodeled interior.
At the “Create Your Own” tossed salad bar, people can choose one of three salad greens, one protein option, three toppings, and a dressing for $6.99. ABP still offers grab-and-go salads for people in a hurry.
There is also a self-serve soup bar, featuring 10 soups, as well as new hot sandwiches on the menu.
Additional cash registers are now located away from the counter in order to allow people not ordering off the menu to skip the counter line.
The front of the restaurant is still being remodeled; ABP will have its official grand opening on Saturday, Jan. 29.

Looking for a challenging course this term? We’ve combed through the Q Guide and compiled a list of some of the hardest courses at the College this spring.
Social Studies 10b: "Introduction to Social Studies"
Although 76 percent of students enrolled in this course last spring rated it as "difficult" or "very difficult," 94 percent of them would recommend it. Their recommendations, however, don't really matter: Social Studies 10b is required of all social studies concentrators, one of the most popular concentrations at the College.
 
Chemistry 161: "Statistical Thermodynamics"
Ninety-four percent of students enrolled in this class last spring rated the course as "difficult" or "very difficult," and 95 percent of them would "definitely not recommend" or are "unlikely to recommend" this course. Here's a bit of advice from one Q Guide student comment: "If you have to take it, take it pass/fail."
Philosophy 151z: "Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics"
 
Although 75 percent of students rated this course as "difficult" or "very difficult" the last term it was offered, which was in the fall of 2009, 85 percent of students indicated they were "likely to recommend" it or would recommend it "with enthusiasm." One student comment in the Q Guide seems to reflect the general consensus of students who completed the course: "Tons of work, but totally worth it if you’re interested in the subject matter." 
Applied Mathematics 120: "Applicable Linear Algebra"
One comment in the Q Guide urges potential students to "be prepared to work hard. Real hard," but as this is an applied mathematics course, we'll let the numbers speak for themselves: 81 percent of students rated this course as "difficult" or "very difficult" the last term it was offered, which was in the fall of 2009. 
Economics 1126: "Quantitative Methods in Economics"
Seventy-two percent of students enrolled in this course last spring rated this course as either "difficult" or "very difficult," and only 23 percent would recommend this course without "reservations." Student comments were unavailable in the Q Guide as "no student responses were submitted or the course head opted to not display the text responses." 
Physics 123: "Laboratory Electronics"
Although 88 percent of students enrolled in this course last spring rated it as either "difficult" or "very difficult," 77 percent of them would recommend the course. The comments offered by former students ranged from glowing reviews to outright condemnations. One student comment in the Q Guide is reflective of the mixed feelings students felt towards this course: "This has the potential to be the best class you take at Harvard, but it could very well be the worst."
Government 1061: "The History of Modern Political Philosophy"
Although 67 percent of students enrolled in this course last spring rated it as either "difficult" or "very difficult," 88 percent of them would recommend the course. One student comment in the Q Guide seems to aptly summarize the course's reputation: "Be prepared to give your life up."
Computer Science 225: "Pseudorandomness"
 
Here's your opportunity to study "pseudorandom generators, randomness extractors, expander graphs, error-correcting codes, [and] hash functions," in a class that 86 percent of students rated as either "difficult" or "very difficult" the last time it was offered, which was the spring of 2009. Seventy-five percent of students, however, would recommend the course "with enthusiasm" and the remaining 25 percent would be "likely to recommend" it. 
 
Mathematics 55b: "Honors Real and Complex Analysis"
Although 100 percent of the students who took this class last spring rated it as "difficult" or "very difficult," two-thirds of them would recommend the course "with enthusiasm." Most students in the course take Mathematics 55a: "Honors Abstract Algebra" during the fall term, but according to one Q Guide response: "Don’t be afraid for a second to give 55b a shot. New blood is welcome." Be warned, however, the Mathematics Department asserts that "this is probably the most difficult undergraduate math class in the country."
Philosophy 129: "Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason"
Here's your opportunity to study "Kant's views on human knowledge; the role of mind in the production of experience; space and time; self-knowledge and its role in experience; causation; freedom of the will; the persistence of the soul after death; the status of metaphysics; and the relationship between appearance and reality," in a class that 95 percent of students rated as "difficult" or "very difficult" the last time it was offered, which was in the spring of 2009. Although students indicated that they found the class difficult, 100 percent of them said that they would recommend it.

Natalie Portman '03 said in a recent interview with Newsweek Magazine that although she doesn’t have a Facebook account, she's very familiar with the depiction of Harvard's social scene in "The Social Network."
"I went to school with those guys ... I know the Winklevoss twins; I partied with them," Portman said.
Portman, nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Nina Sayers in "Black Swan," joined fellow Oscar nominee James E. Franco and several Newsweek editors to share some of her memories of Harvard's social scene that were incorporated into Aaron B. Sorkin's screenplay for "The Social Network."
"How about when they all go to that [final] club and all those college students are stripping? That is bullshit,” said an incredulous Franco. Portman said that she was not aware of such parties but joked that she just might not have been invited to those parties.
"The whole social scene is men's clubs where girls have to, you know, have to be friends with the guys to get in," Portman said.
"Oh yeah, I got in," said Portman, laughing. "I was an actress."
Portman also discussed the punch process, part of which, in the film, entailed punches carrying around a live chicken.
"They didn't know what to do with the chickens afterward and they killed like 400 chickens in the basement of one of these clubs," Portman said.
"But I don't think that happened when they were—that happened when I was a freshman, I think," Portman added.
Portman also discussed her positive experiences with classmates during her time at Harvard.
"I have a group of amazing friends for the past, you know, it's more than 10 years now who are doing really interesting things, are really successful in completely different worlds, and who turn me on to different things; they're interesting people and just like normal, good people who are kind of like a little bubble around me," she said.
Portman attributed her positive experience to attending college before "the age of camera phones, online gossip, and Twitter."
"I was completely left alone for four years," she said. "I really was just like a regular student there and everyone treated me like that, and I made friends that way."
Portman’s performance in "Black Swan" has been met with astonishing commercial and critical success. Her newest film, "No Strings Attached," a romantic comedy costarring Ashton Kutcher opened on Jan. 21.
