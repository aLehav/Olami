After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opening in Agassiz Theatre tonight, “Yes or No?” promises to be a provocative performance. Sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Harvard College Women’s Center, “Yes or No?” invites the audience to transcend passive spectatorship and engage with the show itself. The performance is experimental in its structure and does not have a traditional script—instead, it is a collection of different social experiences at Harvard, each presented in a slightly different way.
 
“There isn’t one clear answer to sexual assault at Harvard or one clear experience of it,” facilitator Bex H. Kwan ’14 says. “[That’s] why the show is called ‘Yes or No?’”


OSAPR traditionally organizes a performance every February. Last year, the organization sponsored the play “The Vagina Monologues,” but this year Kwan wanted to collaborate with OSAPR to create a show that gives voice to students challenging social expectations at Harvard.
 
 
“In the fall there was a lot of energy around sexual assault in general,” Kwan says. In continuation of this conversation, the performance encourages dialogue but does not center on conveying a specific message. Rather, its ambiguity is meant to ask the audience members to consider their feelings about the social scene at Harvard. “It isn’t linear in any way. I think every audience that enters will have a different experience of the show,” Kwan says.
 
 
The show uses a variety of different art forms and draws on the collaborators’ diverse talents. “It’s very interdisciplinary; there’s dance, poetry, singing, theater,” collaborator Braden M. Thue ’16 says.
 
 
“You will not only be an audience member.... we are inviting you to share a space with us,” says collaborator Cassandra E. Euphrat-Weston ’14. Though the material is rather unconventional, Kwan encourages any student to come see the show and engage in the vital conversation about attitudes towards sex, gender, rape, expectations, and relationships at Harvard.

“punkplay”
By Gregory S. Moss
Directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14
Produced by Andrew P. Gelfand ’15 and Josef A. Durand ’14
 
  The music of the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, and the Minutemen will blare throughout "punkplay," directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14 and opening in the Loeb Ex on February 22. The play is less a portrait of the 1980s punk scene than a coming-of-age story that tackles issues of isolation and conformity. “The play tells a story that we’re all familiar with,” Brandt says. “We’ve just lived through this chapter of our lives.”
 “punkplay,” written by recent Brown graduate Gregory Moss, unfolds in disjointed episodes, each informed by a famous punk song. The plot follows the relationship between high school students Duck (Mark J. Mauriello ’15) and Mickey (Matt J. Bialo ’15) as they turn to the punk mindset of Reagan’s America. Duck, hot-tempered and manipulative, serves as the antagonist to the more reserved and vulnerable Mickey.
 
  “You can almost see them as two halves of the same person,” Mauriello says. “But it’s also a love story.” As the two grapple with their own changing relationship and immerse themselves in the world of punk, they begin to realize that their new culture may be just as oppressive as the one from which they came.
 
The versatile black box of the Loeb Ex will allow Brandt and his four-person cast—which also includes Lily R. Glimcher ’14 and Christian N. Fohrby ’14—to approach the staging creatively. The characters will be on roller skates the whole time, though they will mostly ignore them, walking clunkily around the Cambridge bedroom in which the whole play takes place. By framing the show in a box within the larger black box theater, Brandt hopes to heighten focus and intimacy.
 
“This play has been with me for a long time,” Brandt says. “It’s been really interesting to explore these characters, internally and externally, and watch them come alive.”

The main stage at the American Repertory Theater was off balance when lights came up on “The Glass Menagerie.” The right side was set with spare trappings of faded middle class comforts—a sofa upholstered in dated red fabric, a living room table with straight-backed chairs, a folding paper screen, and a phonograph. The left side was dominated by a dizzying series of fire escapes, stumbling and zigzagging upwards, half-illuminated by blue light. Eight stories were visible, shrinking as they approached the ceiling of the theater. The sense that the fire escapes carried on into the cosmos was difficult to escape, especially as Tom Wingfield, the narrator and uneasy protagonist of Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass Menagerie,” took to the stage in his opening monologue and—twirling for a moment with his back to the audience, arms raised upwards at the infinite fire escapes—declared it to be “a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from.”
 Director John Tiffany found a balance between a cut-and-dry interpretation of “The Glass Menagerie”—now playing at the ART until March 17—and his own bent towards shock and awe. In doing so he gracefully translated Williams’s classic work onto the modern stage. This smack of the surreal Bob Crowley's set design found its match in the direction as Tom (Zachary Quinto) introduces his sister Laura (Celia Keenan-Bolger). Tom reaches into the back of the sofa, pulling thin white arms out from between the cushions, followed by a silent Laura. Laura’s appearance from within the couch cushions was breathtaking, and as off-kilter as the stage. This intriguing moment was in keeping with the script—for Tom, Laura is relegated to memory—as her character is so ingrained in the apartment that it makes perfect sense for her to materialize from the furniture like a summoned ghost. After the initial theatrics, however, Tiffany decides not to play up moments of shock, instead choosing to play a longer, subtler game which perfectly complements Williams's tense and slow-moving script.
 
Quinto, of the 2009 film “Star Trek” and the television show “Heroes," plays Tom as a fascinating mix of petulant and knowing—caught between an irresistible desire to escape and an instinctual drive to be with his family that, for most of the play, kept him at his harping mother’s side. Quinto often translates these conflicting impulses kinetically; he walks either with intense energy or drags his feet with marked inefficiency, his shoulders bunched around his neck in a motion of aggressive self-concealment. Many times he seems to be on the verge of physically lashing out, even during the rare moments he had to himself on the stage.
 
Against his foil of static aggression, Quinto’s counterparts, Cherry Jones (who plays Amanda Wingfield) and Keenan-Bolger, both succeed in rendering their characters with subtlety and emotional honesty. The fourth and last member of the cast, Brian J. Smith (who plays Gentleman Caller, Laura’s long-awaited suitor) is less successful—he was seemingly unsure of how earnestly to play his part and ultimately settled into a wholesome, jocular interpretation that left him little room to explore the complexities of Williams's characterization. Keenan-Bolger is stiff-legged and shell-shocked—every motion seems to have been wrenched painfully out of her. She delivers her lines with a wide-eyed openness somehow absent of innocence and presents Laura as a character too damaged by shyness and her sheltered lifestyle to seem pure. Cherry Jones, a Tony Award-winning actress and a founding member of the ART, is stunning in the role of Amanda Wingfield. When speaking with her children, Amanda relies on a mix of maternal wheedling and brute force to have her way. There is a raw edge of desperation that cuts beneath her words—a kind of deep need that manifests in unrelenting action and vivacity. As she plays up her aging Southern belle mannerisms for laughs or cleverly snipes with Tom, Jones employs a stream of constant energy to act as insulation for Amanda’s complex psychology.
 
In the few moments when Amanda is not nagging her children and instead turns her attention to her magazine customers, Jones reveals the true force of her acting abilities—she captures the contradictions and vulnerabilities that mark Williams’s depiction of Amanda Wingfield. In two separate scenes, Amanda cajoles her customers, delivering the righteous, overly sympathetic line, “You’re a Christian martyr, that’s what you are. A Christian martyr," waiting for the women to agree—to fall in line underneath her heavy-handed manipulation. But when she fails at this, Jones’ acting abilities are most finely-tuned—she quickly flicks discouragement off her face, carefully replacing the set look that she relies upon to carry her through her life, which, as she says towards the end of the play, “has a way of turning out so badly.”
 
On the whole, Tiffany’s “Glass Menagerie” is marked by dabs of the experimental, but, in the end, is a faithful and classic production of Williams’s piece. The strength of the cast, especially the phenomenal Jones, undoubtedly carries the show, while the innovative set design and occasional touches of the absurd add a modern flavor that illuminates the stranger facets of Williams’s seminal work.

 As snow began to fall last Friday, Harvard graduate students, humanities professors, and music experts gathered at the Barker Center for a conference entitled “Africa Remix: Producing and Presenting African Musics Abroad.”  Keynote speaker Francis Falceto, music curator, and producer of the acclaimed 27-disc “Éthiopiques” CD series, spoke about his effort to bring late-20th century Ethiopian music to the Western world.
 The conference, which was a collaboration between the department of Music, the Provostial Fund for the Arts and Humanities, the department of African and African American Studies, the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, the Committee on African Studies, and the Office for the Arts at Harvard, raised a multifaceted conversation about the music of Africa.The defining element of the conference was a conversation about recent developments in the field of African music.
 To that end, presenters incorporated music excerpts of globally prominent African artists into their presentations. Each attendee was also given CDs of African music. These included a sampler of songs from Cumbancha, an independent record label specializing in world music, and “Jumbie in the Jukebox,” the second album by Kobo Town, a calypso artist whose music incorporates reggae, poetry, and lyrics about current events.Falceto kicked off the conversation with a discussion of the common misconceptions about music and globalization.
 Falceto explained that the audience for African music outside of Africa has grown over his more than 30 years as a producer of Ethiopian music. “[However, African music is] now not as groovy as it was half a century ago,” he said, referring to the changing assortment of instruments used to make the music. According to Falceto, in Ethiopia, technological innovations such as the electronic keyboards that were introduced around 1974 during the Ethiopian Civil War had a significant effect on Ethiopian music. African music is now enjoyed by an audience that comes from beyond the African continent, and Falceto says that the incorporation of new instruments is in part responsible for the resonance it has reached outside Africa.
  Falceto and the other presenters also discussed the incorporation of Western influences into contemporary African music. Sarah Hankins, a Ph.D. candidate in ethnomusicology,  explained her research on the presence of Ethiopians in Tel Aviv to address questions of identity in remixed African music. In between clips of music from artists like Groove Ambassadors, a band that plays African music in 10 different languages, and Zvuloon Dub System, an Israeli dub band, Hankins shared how the merging of cultures and the new identity of Ethiopian transmigrants and settlers in Tel Aviv has influenced the emergence of African remixed music in Israel.Remixed African music not only strengthens the identities of Africans living abroad, but also serves as a unifying force within Africa, Hankins said.
 Harvard social anthropology Ph.D. candidate Sharon F.  Kivenko  discussed the role of Malian music in political activism. Efforts to establish post-colonial nationalism in the region were stifled by the fall of the Malian government in March 2012, she explained. As creativity became threatened by the religious zeal and war of this time of conflict, Malian artists like Amkoullel have been using music to voice criticism of governmental corruption and to mobilize the Malian people to repair their country. Kivenko shared a clip of “La Paix Au Mali,” a song by Oumou Sangaré calling for peace in Mali.
 “Through this song, this woman, who Forbes has deemed the ninth most powerful African celebrity, was not only looking to reach her Malian compatriots or West African neighbors. She is also intending for this song to serve as plea to her international audience,” Kivenko said.  When the conversation was then opened to the audience, an attendee asked whether the influx of foreign influences into African music is a positive change. The attendees who commented agreed that borrowing between cultures has allowed for African music to be shared across continental borders. However, a division emerged concerning whether collaboration was synonymous with appropriation.
 Despite this rosy representation of musical harmony, the blending of musical styles is also affected by a diversity of sociopolitical factors. “It’s not that you can’t cross those [musical] boundaries,” said Ingrid T. Monson, a professor of African-American music. “It’s not that you can’t be an honorable mediator. But you better think about the politics and economics and the history of color.”A concert scheduled for the evening of the conference was cancelled due to weather conditions as a result of a historic blizzard that hit New England last Friday. Yet even in less than optimal conditions, the conference was able to foster interdisciplinary discussion about the evolution of African music in the international sphere.

When avid followers of sports scandals were preoccupied learning the bizarre details of Manti Te’o’s non-existent love life, Lance E. Armstrong, the former holder of seven Tour de France victories, finally sat down and came out as one of the country’s most loathsome liars and one of its most arrogant cheats. The reaction to his two-part interview with Oprah Winfrey was a mixture of reprobation and ennui, tinged with the cynical realization that Armstrong’s motive for his remorseless confession was to get back in good standing with irascible bureaucrats in the cycling firmament.
A pointed few in the media have defended Armstrong on the basis of his assertion that “if they gave Tour de France trophies to people who were drug-free, they would have to find their winners in grade school.” While I am sympathetic to that point, this is not meant to be an apologia for Armstrong. It is fair to be annoyed and angered at the duplicity of Armstrong. Yet, American citizens should be more disturbed at the actions of his primary foe in this saga, the United States Anti-Doping and, by extension, the United States government.
Wherever Armstrong may currently stand in the court of public opinion, the main point is that he broke the rules. As a result, the International Cyclists Union should be able to do whatever it wants to him, his United States Postal Service team, and every other crook it catches on a street bike. Being the world governing body for a sport comes with the privilege of getting to make the rules and mete out commensurate punishment. Bud Selig has the right to crack down on performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball, and Roger S. Goodell can hand out fines to keep players from making career-ending tackles in the National Football League. Similarly, the UCI should be able to determine the appropriate amount of testosterone and red blood cells a Tour de France participant can have in his body.
Yet, in the case of doping, the UCI, which is based in Switzerland, does not have full control over its sport. Rather, it has been forced to accept the investigatory findings of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, a non-governmental organization primarily funded with U.S. taxpayer money. While many Americans spent last month wondering why they were supposed to care that Armstrong admitted what was already widely known, few realized that they themselves were the ones probing his lifestyle choices in the first place.
The three-year molestation of Armstrong by American kibitzers is not yet complete. The United States Justice Department is now poised to join a whistleblower lawsuit filed by former Armstrong teammate Floyd Landis. The suit accuses Armstrong of defrauding the government under the False Claims Act, as his team violated the terms of its United States Postal Service sponsorship. If Landis were to win the case, the government would receive the majority of the $60 million award, three times the amount it paid to support the team. The post office is currently losing $25 million a day, so a victory in court might prolong its lifespan for a couple hours.
Missing from this scenario is the UCI, which had previously tried to stop the USADA from interloping in its affairs. USADA CEO Travis Tygart has pilloried the organization in charge of cycling, saying he “was shocked that [sporting] federations here still handle doping cases.” That statement is rather nutty; it makes perfect sense that a sporting federation handles its own affairs. It makes considerably less sense that an unelected body of government-supported pencil pushers dictates how a sport chooses to conduct itself in matters of athletics.
Opponents of government intervention in sporting events can easily attest that doping is a victimless crime. Yet, such an assertion’s validity rests on the fictional notion that doping is a crime at all. The only “laws” against performance-enhancing drugs come from questionable treaties written by globetrotting jock sniffers who lack athletic skill but still want to feel sportive. While everyone should be allowed to chase his or her career dream, it is rather disappointing that governments around the world spend public funds on such priggishness.
Globalization has increased the realms in which governments interact. As such, countries naturally have to reach compromises beyond affairs such as migration and commerce. However, when it comes to sports, which lack any relationship to a country’s national security, it is best for governments to stay out. Governments don’t punish students when they are caught cheating or journalists when they are caught plagiarizing. If cycling wants to punish Lance Armstrong, so be it. Meanwhile, let the government get back to running the country.

After almost three decades of representing Massachusetts in the Senate, Secretary of State John F. Kerry has moved onto to bigger and better things. The former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry has left big shoes to fill. His replacement, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, does not appear to be up to the task. Upon assuming Kerry’s old job, Menendez was hit by a barrage of ethical misconduct allegations in connection with his relationship to Dr. Salomon E. Melgen, an eye-surgeon who has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns.
Late last month, Dr. Melgen’s offices were raided by the F.B.I. Though the government kept mum about the search, disturbing details soon emerged. Menendez had intervened on Dr. Melgen’s behalf in a dispute with Medicare about billing procedures. In 2010, Dr. Melgen had treated Menendez to free flights to the Dominican Republic aboard his private airplane. Some unsubstantiated reports claimed that while on vacation there the two hired underage prostitutes.
The facts surrounding this case are murky, and no doubt things will come into clearer focus over the next few weeks. The Senate Ethics Committee has begun its own review and Menendez has not been criminally charged. We cannot yet call on him to resign his seat. Nonetheless, the unrecompensed rides, which he finally paid for, represent a severe ethical lapse on their own. The charges also indicate, if not prove, a willingness to place the profit margins of his donors before the national interest. Menendez, for example, may have pushed the U.S. to enforce a Dominican port security plan because it benefit a corporation owned by Dr. Melgen.
Menendez asserts that he has committed no improprieties. He never had sex with prostitutes. He interceded with Medicare to simplify a byzantine reimbursement process. Clerical errors were responsible for the non-disclosure of the plane rides. His involvement in the port security matter was motivated by substantive policy concerns. All this may be true, but how credulous can be we be? A mountain of evidence and an air smacking of “Boardwalk Empire” suggest otherwise.
The Foreign Relations Committee is one of the Senate’s most important bodies. Menendez’s troubles cannot distract from its critical work. Neither should it be led by a man who might monetize the position to detrimental effect. For the duration of the ethics inquiry, Menendez should step down from his post. It wouldn’t be proper to replace John Kerry with a Senator who, if the allegations are true, appears to be only slightly less corrupt than “Boardwalk Empire’s” Walter Edge.

Drone strikes have received attention from nearly every academic association and think tank, including the American Society of International Law, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Naval War College. And, for better or worse, they have become a permanent feature of American foreign policy debates, from journalists and policymakers to human rights groups and non-governmental organizations.
Of course, these discussions are vital and necessary. The ideals of American democracy and the unprecedented questions of their use require extensive discussions on drone strikes. Yet, no one has discussed drone strikes in relation to another critical development of U.S. national security policy, the eroding distinction between war and peace, a topic recently highlighted in the Washington Post’s series on the Permanent War.
Recent discussions have connected the topics only in terms of current changes in national security policy. An article on the forever war may use a picture of a drone strike or it may use the expansion of drone bases as an example of the ways in which counterterrorism operations have expanded.
Yet, the relationship between drone strikes and temporal distinctions of war and peace is much more complex. Recent developments in national security policy show much more than an incidental connection between the two.
We may soon enter a point in which autonomous weapon systems actually define the distinction between war and peace.
In the past few years, the United States has pursued counterterrorism operations throughout the world while minimizing the commitment of American troops throughout the world. As a result, U.S. national security policy has become increasingly dependent on weapons technologies to replace conventional forces.
Granted, this is not a new phenomenon. In fact, it significantly echoes Eisenhower’s policy of massive retaliation. However, nuclear weapons did not influence the distinction between war and peace since they represented the culmination of total war. Drone strikes may influence the nature of modern warfare in much more profound ways.
West Africa may have already set the precedent for these changes. In October, France announced that it would send drones to Mali as an effort to combat Islamic insurgents. A couple of weeks ago, France made the decision to send actual combat forces to the region. In response to this announcement, the United Kingdom provided combat support units, which is a fairly typical response in these situations. At the same time, the United States has announced that it will build a drone base in Niger to support counterterrorism operations in West Africa.
France’s decision to use drones acted as only one stage of escalation towards war in a manner similar to the deployment of support units. Similarly, the decision of the United States to establish a drone base operates in a manner similar to the traditional practice of support troops in post-conflict settings.
These developments, along with the proliferation of drone bases throughout the world, point to a world in which the distinction between peace and war defines itself in terms of the decision to deploy people as opposed to technology. Since drones represent an escalation towards combat or a withdrawal from combat, times of war may only occur in relation to the use of actual combat forces rather than the use of technologies like drones.
However, this distinction is troubling on several levels. To start, drones have combat abilities in themselves. If these definitions of war and peace took effect, a tool of war may be used in a time of peace, particularly as a final step before the decision to deploy combat forces. At best, the new definition of war and peace remains nebulous. At worst, all drone strikes may violate the laws of war, a concept with particularly daunting consequences for the strategic doctrine of the Obama administration.
To get around this difficulty, then, the laws of war would require the use of armed drones only in accompaniment with the use of combat forces, in a manner similar to the current use of American combat drones in Afghanistan.
Although this requirement may negate the strategic advantage of a drone strike, namely the ability to target enemy combatants without risking the lives of your own soldiers, it also provides several advantages. It ensures the presence of human intelligence on the ground, which is necessary to minimize collateral damage, and it negates the biggest risk of armed combat drones, by reducing the cost of military engagement to the point that force no longer becomes a necessary option of last resort.
By connecting the use of armed drone strikes to a time of war necessitating the use of combat forces, policymakers could reduce the current ambiguities of national security policy, a field defined partly by our attempts to provide order in a fundamentally anarchic world.

To the editor:
In her editorial “Rethink TFA”, Emma M. Lind urges seniors who might be considering applying to Teach For America to consider other pathways into teaching. There are a number of excellent options; however, TFA remains one of the most impactful career choices you can make if you are passionate about education. Being a TFA corps member has had a greater impact on my career than any other decision I have made, including choosing to attend Harvard.
I joined the Baltimore TFA corps in 2000 and went on to teach in my placement school for three years. The training and coaching I received helped me improve significantly throughout my first year; it also inspired me to stay teaching beyond my two-year commitment and to help coach other beginning teachers. A significant body of research shows that this support works. Studies by independent institutions such as Mathematic Policy Research and the Urban Institute have found that students taught by TFA members performed as well as, or better than, students taught by non-TFA teachers.
More compelling than any study to me, however, are the ninth grade students I taught. I will never forget one  student, Cornell. When I first met Cornell, he skipped school, failed to complete homework, and was multiple grade levels behind. But with the help of his grandparents, counselor, me, and the other teachers on the ninth grade team, he turned it around and even asked for a front row seat as well as tutoring and extra work. Like so many of my other students, Cornell taught me that all students want to succeed, and that it is up to us as educators to ensure they have the opportunity to do so.
If you enter teaching through TFA, you will also become a part of network of committed educators, advocates, and entrepreneurs. Almost two-thirds of TFA alumni continue full-time in education, like me, and more than half of those in education are still teaching. As the leaders and founders of exciting entrepreneurial organizations for education reform, TFA alumni are having a tremendous impact across the country.
TFA is certainly not the solution to all the problems that plague our education system. But TFA and its almuni are—without a doubt—making a positive impact on the lives of thousands of students. If you believe, as I do, that closing the achievement gap is the most important civil rights issue of our time, then I hope you will consider applying to Teach For America today.
Nicole B. Dorn ’98
Boston, Mass.
To the editor:
Originally a 2008 Teach for America Mississippi Delta Corps Member, I currently work as an instructional coach and writing teacher at a public charter school in Harlem. In a recent editorial, Emma M. Lind, one of my fellow Delta alums, encouraged Harvard seniors to “Rethink TFA.” With the final application due today, I feel compelled to say: think again.
Lind doubts TFA’s effectiveness. She argues that prospective teachers should opt for traditional certification programs instead. Like Lind, I grapple with many tough questions about the TFA. I wonder about the issues raised by its brief summer training, aggressive expansion, and arrogant undertones of its marketing campaign.
But at the end of the day, I can’t agree that traditional certification programs necessarily build better teachers. I have worked with many educators from traditional schools of education and from TFA. In my experience, both crops produce bad, good, and great apples. This has been true in every setting I’ve worked: charter, public, rural, and urban.
Granted, my experience is my own. Dozens of studies, similar to those cited by Lind, attempt to offer a broader, more objective perspective. But these studies reach conclusions that are contradictory and thus unpersuasive. Supporters and detractors can both find support in papers that raise more questions than answers. Most frustrating are their inconsistent metrics of what constitutes "effective" teaching, which is an art and science most difficult to measure.
It saddens me when conversations in education reform equivocate over trees and miss the forest. At the end of the day, we need fantastic people in our nation’s classrooms. Some will come from certification programs. Others will come through Teach for America. Honestly, it doesn’t matter. Teaching is a surprising and unbelievably challenging job. The first years will throw you, no matter your training. The people who survive—and thrive—do so not based on what they have done, but what they are willing to do.
So, when it comes to you and teaching, that is all I want to know. What are you willing to do for your future students? If your answer is “anything”—and if you mean it—get yourself in a classroom. Get there however you want. Apply to TFA. Apply to a fellowship. Apply to ed school. There is no single path to becoming a great teacher. Do what makes sense, what feels right, for you. After all, people learn and grow in very different ways—a secret that any great teacher can tell you.

More Questions than Answers
Drones and other autonomous weapons systems have provided several strategic benefits to counterterrorism operations. They allow for nearly unlimited reconnaissance with a level of detail that satellites cannot provide and endurance that human intelligence cannot maintain. They also provide an incredibly valuable tool by pursuing enemy combatants without the risk to human life, a fact which may explain their broad public support.
Yet, drones do not yet follow an established operative framework, which has raised several significant questions about their use. One question involves the rule of law, both in terms of their use in non-combat zones abroad and the current lack of executive transparency at home.
Another question concerns the paradox of intelligence gathering. Since drones inherently depend on human intelligence to confirm opportunities and targets, we can only trust them to the extent that we trust the information which legitimates their use. At the same time, drones may actually increase mistrust of the West and fuel anti-American sentiment, which in turn makes intelligence gathering more difficult.
However, there is another, more significant problem. By removing the human beings from the equation, drones may actually cheapen armed conflict to the point that it becomes a primary option rather than a last resort.
The ultimate question raised by drones then is what happens next—could armed conflict become a preferred option to diplomacy? Could a state of war become a permanent aspect of modern life if unit production is the only cost? And, in the short term, could drones unnecessarily prolong a conflict in which there is no strategic definition of victory, such as a war against ideology? Already, some would argue that the answer is yes.
Yes, drones have provided some significant strategic benefits, but we cannot evaluate their worth until we find answers to the questions they raise.

Drones Require Different Moral Approach
The drone strikes employed by the Obama Administration are "necessary" only insofar as they fit into the moral calculus inherent in being the country's Commander-in-Chief. As weapons of mass terror, drones can hold entire Afghani cities hostage to periods of perpetual fear and suffering. However, unlike an American occupation, they require fewer forces on the ground and thus save American lives. The implicit moral calculation a President must make is how many foreign lives are worth one American life.
A common-sense humanitarian—nay, most Americans—would probably argue that the ratio is one to one. However the logic is different for an American president whose political capital fluctuates directly with his approval ratings. Wars are unpopular. Although the drone campaign is a burdensome evil abroad, it is a preferable domestic political strategy because it keeps young Americans in school instead of on the battlefield.
In this sense drones have been necessary in justifying the War on Terror. Abroad, they have also served various military objectives. As they do not require congressional approval to be launched, drones give the executive branch unilateral direction in ordering and carrying out attacks on targets. The military has pushed for an increase in the use of drones instead of ground troops, members of whom have brought public relations stains to the army by burning Korans and publicly urinating on corpses. In relation to boots on the ground, drones are superior to troops for two main reasons: they are more effective and they minimize the risk of American fatalities.
Drones are not perfect. They carry clear moral repercussions; removing the finger behind the trigger of a soldier in Afghanistan and giving it to a Washington bureaucrat weakens our desire to pursue peaceful alternatives. But drones have been both vital to our efforts abroad and brutally effective in the War on Terror.

The Never-Ending Drone War 
 
In his second inaugural address, President Obama declared, “We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.” Yet the administration’s legal justification for the use of drones to kill American citizens explicitly relies on the premise that we are at war. While drones have been effective in killing leading terrorists, their use threatens to continue the United States’ commitment to war for the foreseeable future rather than helping to end the longest state of war in our nation’s history.
As laid out in a recently leaked Justice Department white paper, the administration derives the legal justification for these attacks primarily from the Authorization for Use of Military Force. This 2001 law authorizes the president to combat those responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks in order to prevent future attacks.
The administration defines “those responsible” as the senior members of al Qaeda or associated groups who pose an “imminent threat” to the United States by planning or participating in terrorist activities. Further, the administration claims the right to kill without evidence of a specific terrorist plot and says merely having been involved in the previous planning of terrorist activities is enough. Given al Qaeda’s widespread reach in the Middle East and Africa, what current or future terrorist group in the region would not qualify as a target? And how many leaders of these groups have never been involved in the planning of attacks against the United States? I fear the administration has effectively given itself the power to kill any American citizen high up in any terrorist group until such groups no longer exist—or until Congress repeals the AUMF.
The United States will never be able to wipe out terrorism entirely. Obama’s drone war thus calls for perpetual war.

Drones: a Good Tool for a Tough Job
The United States’ use of combat drones is quasi-Orwellian and has become a blemish to our national image. Despite this, the use of drones is a fundamentally good policy for the United States.
Drones are the best tool we have for conducting surgical strikes in populated areas. Drones can constantly monitor an area, find the best possible moment to strike, and stay on site to monitor the results without endangering the lives of US forces.
Like any new invention, our understanding of how to best use drones is still evolving, and a critical public eye is key to ensure the proper development of drone doctrines. Public pressure has ensured that every strike is agonizingly reviewed beforehand, and as a result fewer mistakes are made every year. A drone can monitor a situation for hours before striking, making it less likely to kill innocents than traditional methods. Although these strikes will still generate anger, this is more to do with the inherently violent nature of war and not due to the nature of drones themselves.  Drones have become a symbol for our wars, and therefore popular opinion about them is a reflection of opinions about our wars on the whole. From the constant surveillance required by modern warfare to the terrifying destruction wrought by a modern missile, drones embody the horror of modern warfare. Yet, Drones are the best tool our servicemen and women have to wage war. Objections against the use of these tools are misdirected—protest the war, not the drone.

It was the night before the CS50 final project was due, and Nikhil L. Benesch ’16 was in high demand. In his first semester at Harvard, Benesch had already skipped CS50, the intro-level computer science class, and advanced to more challenging material. His freshmen friends had—predictably—come begging for help. The mood was buoyant as the adrenaline-addled group coded into the final hours before their deadline.
“Oh my god, this is going to make us rich,” Benesch, a Crimson Tech Associate, remembers kidding. This was part grandiloquent team-building, part jab at his buddies for finishing so shoddily and so close to the deadline.
They’d gotten the joke. “Guys, this is it,” someone had retorted. “We should drop out of Harvard for this.”
It was one of those jokes that is only funny because everyone knows there’s some truth beneath the absurdity. Describing the scene, Benesch breaks into a laugh and then stops, suddenly serious. “But it’s never been quite a joke for me,” he says.
Benesch is hardly alone.
Maybe it’s a fluke, or maybe it’s some secret entrepreneurial ingredient, but Harvard has a knack for churning out dropouts armed with the seeds of the Next Big Idea. First there was Bill Gates, slated to graduate in 1977, who left Harvard to found Microsoft and reinvent the cyber world. Then came Mark Zuckerberg, who dropped out in 2004 to found Facebook, reinventing computer culture all over again.
The Computer Science faculty doesn’t take that legacy lightly. Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science Harry R. Lewis ’68, who has been at Harvard since 1964, first as an undergrad, then as a grad student, and finally as a professor, has taught Gates, Zuckerberg, and several more recent entrepreneurial dropouts.
“I always encourage students who have a burr under their saddle to take time off and deal with it,” he writes in an email. “They can come back to school any time, but they will have a lifetime to regret not seizing an opportunity that presented itself.”
In Lewis’s experience, most undergrads who drop out return to Harvard. The University makes it simple to return after taking time off, Lewis explains: Harvard allows students to take semesters off without any effect on their financial aid packages.
“It virtually never happens that people fail and never return,” he writes. “And even people who succeed tend to return.”
That’s what Meir Lakhovsky did. An Advanced Standing degree candidate in the Computer Science Department, Lakhovsky stayed at Harvard for five semesters, until he left in 2010.
“I loved the school!” Lakhovsky says. “I never thought I’d leave.” But during his junior year, Lakhovsky began working on PushPage, a social media tool that allows users to create and share question and answer sessions. His 80-hour-per-week commitment to the startup proved incompatible with a full course load. “My friends thought I should stay in school and wondered why I couldn’t work on my business later,” Lakhovsky says. “But with startups, timing is everything.”
A programmer (a.k.a. efficiency guru), Lakhovsky was frustrated by the bureaucracy that he says slows down Harvard life. But leaving Harvard required only one signature on one form. “Taking time off was the easiest thing I did at Harvard!” he quips.
This fall, Lakhovsky took three classes at Harvard—enough to earn his degree. He says he has no regrets about the decision to leave when he did.
Unlike Lakhovsky, Daniel E. Windham ’15 came to Harvard intending to drop out. The biographical blurb on Windham’s Twitter account reads, “Officially I’m #cs #neuro @harvard, but will probably have left to start a company before I make it to junior year.”
He did. During the finals week of his first semester, Windham stumbled upon an idea he says he can’t disclose yet. “I went, ‘Oh my god I have to do this!’” he recalls. “The longer you wait, the more likely it becomes that somebody else will do the same thing.”
Windham soon realized he lacked the technical skills to jump straight into his own startup and joined a different business called Athena. “The technical abilities you learn in CS50 are not the best for building distributed software,” he says. “A good metaphor is learning English grammar versus learning to write well,” he clarifies. “A class on Shakespeare is not the right place to learn predicate-noun agreement.”
Windham’s complaints about Harvard go beyond his academic experiences. He says it’s a question of the school’s mentality. “I was frequently fighting the cultural bias at Harvard that there was one correct path, one way by which one figures things out, one optimal strategy,” he says. Windham adopts a mock-heroic baritone to play-act as the institutional voice of Harvard: “‘Look, you’re going to focus on your classes.’”
“The problem is,” Windham says, “I didn’t think the most useful thing I could be spending time on was my classes.”
That’s a view to which Benesch, the not-so-facetious potential dropout, can relate.
“I’d like to get out of here,” Benesch says. “It’s weird. Classes don’t have that much real world value. There’s this ideal of a liberal arts education, but I’ve always found coding more enjoyable and meaningful. It’s the best way to create something. I can’t paint, I can’t write well, but I can sit down and solve problems.”
Does that mean that he is ready to leave New England for warmer climes and higher stakes? Not quite yet.
“I’d leave Harvard for the right idea,” Benesch says, and then catches himself. “See, there’s this signaling effect. For better or for worse, people see the Harvard degree and assume you must be great.”
If you’re looking for a job at a big company, that is. But Benesch can’t stop gushing about starting out on his own. “I’m not sure you’re getting what’s profoundly exciting about this,” he says. “Are you getting what’s so exciting about this?”
“You could literally go anywhere in the world, and all you need is your laptop,” he says, waxing lyrical. “Whether you eat depends on the code you write. Every day everything’s on the line.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 10, 2013
An earlier version of this article misquoted Daniel E. Windham ’15 as saying he believes that the skills learned in CS50 are “not the best for building distributable software.” In fact, Windham referred to “distributed software.”

“Be Mine.” “True Love.” “Cutie Pie.” “Fax Me.”
For well over a century, lovers the world over have expressed their feelings on Valentine’s Day through red ink on a chalky pastel candy. Today, lovestruck sweet tooths consume 12 to 14 million pounds of the stuff each year.
All of it is made less than 10 miles from Harvard Square, in Revere, Mass.—home to the New England Confectionary Company, maker of the indomitable Sweetheart.
The plant is ordinarily closed to visitors, but it’s amazing what one can accomplish with an email starting “Hello, I am a writer for The Harvard Crimson, as well as a very big fan of Sky Bars and Sweethearts.”*
—
A walk through NECCO’s massive factory is a step back into the peak era of American manufacturing. Nearly all of the machines which are used today to make NECCO candies have been around since before World War II. The trusty machinery is still at it now, making not only Sweethearts but also the familiar disc-shaped NECCO Wafers, the bright candy buttons that many of us ate off paper strips as children, and an assortment of lesser-known candies with names like Slap Stix, Peach Blossoms, and Squirrel Nut Zippers.
NECCO’s founders were at the cutting edge of confectionary innovation back in 1847, when Oliver Chase created the lozenge cutter which led to the development of NECCO Wafers.
(The recipe, for flavors like clove, cinnamon, and wintergreen, hasn’t changed since then aside from an ill-fated experiment with all-natural flavorings in 2009.) In the 1860s, Oliver’s brother thought of printing messages on the candies in red dye. In 1902, the company started printing them in heart shapes.
But a little less than a century after the Chase brothers’ ingenious inventions, NECCO froze in time, more or less. The holy trinity of candy making—Hershey, Mars, and Nestle—successfully automated every step of the process, from mixing to molding to wrapping up the candy bars and shipping them out the door. Not at NECCO.
At the NECCO factory, an employee dumps food coloring into metal pails full of steaming hot liquid, whisks the batter, and pours it into a machine caked in a coral-reef-bright accumulation of rainbow batter. That machine then drips the intensely colored liquid onto sheets of edible paper, thereby forming 1,000 pounds of candy buttons every day. Four women manually shove finished buttons, which have cooled for a week, into cellophane bags, while another employee drops each bag into a machine that seals it with a puff of steam. Two more box the bags for shipping.
Someday NECCO will be forced to automate, plant manager Hugh Albert says. But right now, the company, which was bought by the venture capital firm American Capital Strategies in 2007, simply doesn’t have the money for new machines. And despite worries about how the company will stay in business, Albert likes it just the way it is.
“I love to see it, because it’s all about the nostalgia, seeing how this process has been done for 70 or 80 years,” he says. Plus, he says, there’s “the human element of it: I love to see people employed.”
—
A few decades ago, it would have been hard to predict that M&Ms and Hershey Kisses would be household names while Canada Mints and Mary Janes would become also-rans.
NECCO looked just as poised to become a major sugary power as any other company, as the history lesson on its website would tell it. NECCO Wafers went off to war with Union soldiers in the 1860s and to the South Pole with Admiral Byrd in the 1930s. When the lights came back on in Times Square at the end of World War II, New Yorkers flocked to see the re-lit NECCO Sky Bar sign.
—
The riddle of NECCO’s quiescence while others were rising to prominence comes down to just one word: marketing.
Other companies advertised, and advertised hard. They paid supermarkets enormous shelving fees to put their products at the check-out line, turning Milky Ways and Crunch bars into typical impulse buys. Asked whether NECCO made a conscious decision not to compete for that shelf space, Albert says, “We never even thought about it.” NECCO’s longtime president didn’t like to spend money marketing his candies.
Since American Capital acquired the company, looking to make it profitable and then sell it again, that president “would have a fit if he heard how much we spend on marketing and advertising now,” Albert says. “It’s tough to keep up with some of these guys. It amazes me every day that a company our size, which is fairly unique, is able to stay in business. You have the giants, and you have the mom-and-pops.”
—
What keeps NECCO afloat as a mid-size maker in a candy landscape split between goliaths and boutiques is, in large part, the Sweetheart.
The conversation hearts go on sale for just six weeks a year, but it takes 10 to 12 months to produce the billions and billions sold during that brief holiday window.
Two days before Valentine’s Day 2013, workers are already making next year’s hearts, 9,000 pounds per hour. An employee paints red dye onto a roller, and 80 different sayings appear on the dough a moment before it is cut into hearts. Clouds of sugar and cornstarch waft into the air constantly as workers dump tray after tray from one machine to the next so that the hearts can be dried, combined, and packaged. Those that come out badly are tossed into waiting containers and later sold as animal feed.
In those six weeks of Sweetheart sales, the company makes more than half its annual profits. “Financially, it’s the bread and butter of this company,” Albert says. “We’re fortunate that we’ve branded the name Sweetheart. That’s us. That will never go away.”
In other words: “Me & You.” “Sweet Love.” “For Ever.”
*For the purposes of full disclosure, a note: Plant manager Hugh Albert kindly insists that those lucky enough to suit up in white coats and hair nets for a private tour of the NECCO factory always walk away with arms loaded with complimentary candies, Crimson reporters included.

This Valentine’s Day, FM charts the course of true literary love—platonic and romantic—across Harvard’s campus and through the ages.
 Adrienne C. Rich ‘51
Radcliffe Quadrangle
Rich didn’t publish her seminal “Twenty-One Love Poems” until 1976—two decades after she graduated from Radcliffe. Even so, some of those poems evoke the intensity of college love: “We want to live like trees, / sycamores blazing through the sulfuric air, / dappled with scars, still exuberantly budding, / our animal passion rooted in the city.”
 Ralph Waldo Emerson, Class of 1821 & Henry David Thoreau, Class of 1837 
Hollis Hall
Although these two literary giants and famous friends probably did not, despite legend, live together at Harvard, Thoreau did later stay on Emerson’s estate. One visitor recalled, “[Thoreau] was much at home with Emerson: and as he remained through the afternoon and evening, and I left him still at the fireside, he appeared to me to belong in some way to the household... [Emerson] seemed to anticipate [Thoreau’s] views, preparing himself obviously for a quiet laugh at Thoreau’s negative and biting criticism.”
 Harold Brodkey ’52
Widener Library
Brodkey published his first short story collection, “First Love and Other Sorrows,” just six years after graduation. It features “Sentimental Education,” a tale of a romance between a Harvard boy and a Radcliffe girl that opens on the Widener steps and closes in front of Adams House—Ali MacGraw does not make an appearance.
 Frank R. O’Hara ’50 & Edward S. J. Gorey ’50
Eliot House
Before O’Hara urged Lana Turner, “we love you get up” in his “Lunch Poems,” or Gorey illustrated an alphabet of deaths in “The Gashlycrumb Tinies,” the two were roommates in Eliot House. “They gave the best parties,” poet Donald Hall ’51 said, as quoted in a 2007 Harvard Magazine article. What did an O’Hara/Gorey soirée feature? As reported by O’Hara’s biographer, Frank Gooch, party guests lay on chaise lounges and listened to Marlene Dietrich records.
 Robert L. Frost, Honorary Class of 1937
Adams House 
Frost, an associate of Adams House, famously wrote in his 1920 poem “Fire and Ice,” “Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice. / From what I’ve tasted of desire / I hold with those who favor fire...” It’s a powerful sentiment, but it might be a little much to drop into a note to your Valentine this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Public Health Department and the Cambridge City Council have fallen out of step on a proposal to limit the amount of soda served in Cambridge restaurants. As members of the Council look to begin exploring the logistics of a soda limitation, the Public Health Department is still unsure whether such a regulation is prudent.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, Chair of the Cambridge City Council’s Community Health Committee, said she hopes to meet with the business community in the next month and assemble a task force on the soda limitation shortly thereafter. But according to Public Health Department spokeswoman Suzy Feinberg, the department will not submit its formal recommendations to the city until late spring­­—nearly a year after the City Council first requested a recommendation on soda and sugar-sweetened beverages in June 2012. That request came soon after Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City proposed capping the size of sodas served in New York at a volume of 16 ounces.
“One of the key issues is whether this type of restriction will result in lower consumption of sugary beverages and reduction in overall caloric intake,” Feinberg wrote to The Crimson in an email. At a meeting with the Council’s Public Health Committee on Jan. 9, the department raised doubts that the proposal would diminish soda intake.
“Does limiting soda size make sense, if people can still buy large size beverages in retail establishments, such as supermarkets and corner stores?” asked Claude-Alix Jacob, Cambridge’s chief public health officer. He added that consumers could also order more servings of soda at restaurants.
When the Council discussed the soda regulation proposal on Jan. 28, Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 voiced concerns about infringing on personal liberties.
But fellow Councillor Craig A. Kelley said he would expect a soda regulation to pass if it were put before the City Council. And Decker said that the final decision does not rest exclusively with the Public Health Department. “This is not [Jacob’s] decision; this is the Council’s decision,” she said.
The Public Health Department and the City Council expressed similarly different opinions in 2006, when the Council asked for a recommendation on the topic of trans fat regulation in Cambridge restaurants.
The department recommended educating restaurateurs about the dangers of trans fat but would not endorse a full ban on trans fats, saying that a lasting relationship with the restaurant community outweighed the short-term benefit of banning trans fat use.
The following year, the City Council established a task force that ultimately did ban trans fat from Cambridge restaurants.
“When I brought the order in to ban trans fat, the Public Department was not sure,” said Decker. “Ultimately, the whole state decided that Cambridge was right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tables covered in gourmet chocolate, pastries, and gift bags of donated cosmetics filled the YWCA in Cambridge Thursday during its 10th annual Valentine’s Day Cosmetics Drive.
Women of all ages and walks of life painted nails, gave each other massages and henna tattoos, and shared life stories—including some about love—throughout the three-hour event, which has become a cherished tradition at the YWCA shelter.
The program was founded in 2003 by former Quincy House Master Jayne Loader, who, along with Dunster House Master Ann Porter, took two bags of collected cosmetics from the Harvard community to the YWCA the week before Valentine’s day that year. “Jayne’s reasoning was, ‘What could be worse than running from an abusive spouse, at a shelter, on Valentine’s day, without a date?’” said Robert M. Gogan, Harvard’s associate manager for recycling services.
Harvard’s Office for Sustainability began spearheading the collection of nail polish, hair treatments, shampoos, perfumes, colognes, soaps, makeup and other toiletries in the month leading up to Valentine’s Day. They increased their efforts after observing large numbers of unused cosmetics in the trash during spring moveout, said Gogan.
The drive has grown from a couple of bags of cosmetics to one ton of donations. These are divided into gift bags for each of the more than 100 women who live permanently in the Tanner Residence of the YWCA Family Shelter.
This year, Loader returned for the 10th anniversary of the drive to drop off donations at the YWCA. The interns and employees of the shelter team up with members of Harvard’s Resource Efficiency Program to decorate the shelter with pink streamers and glitter and provide refreshments for the women who come to receive the donations.
“[It] was just great to be with the women,” said Schuyler S. Engel, case manager of the Tanner House. “Women who live here have all had amazing lives.”
Linda K. King, a resident of the shelter, said that the volunteers “really make a big effort to do something really pleasant” and described the event as “sort of like a cocktail party.” Another resident, Yoko Hershiki, said that the afternoon made her feel loved.
“When I walk into the building, there is so much warmth,” Hershiki said of the event’s atmosphere. “This is about love; love between friends, between neighbors. It’s about girls getting together.”
As residents picked their way through baskets of varying shades of lipstick, trying to find ones that would suit them best, they reminisced about family and past relationships.
“When I get thinner and get my mobility back, men better watch out,” said King.
For many of the residents, the real benefit of the event had nothing to do with material goods. “It’s nice to know that people care about this place, the YWCA,” said Hershiki. “People care about us, about everybody, black or white, young or old, it doesn’t matter. It’s just love and it’s in this room.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two undergraduates have transformed what began as an inspirational conversation with a journalist into an emerging campus initiative dedicated to improving maternal health.
Last spring, Michelle J. Wang ’14 and Eunice Kim ’14-’15 had a conversation with Sheryl WuDunn, coauthor of “Half the Sky­­,” a book about global oppression of women. Wang and Kim were already keenly concerned about the issues of maternal morbidity and malnutrition, but WuDunn encouraged them to take the next step by organizing on campus.
Now, after months of planning,  Wang and Kim have launched the Undergraduate Maternal Health Initiative. The club was approved by the Office of Student Life in November and will hold its first official meeting next week.
“We’re hoping that it’s a way to raise awareness of maternal health and encourage college students to look at different avenues and ways to get involved in maternal health,” Wang said. “Maternal morbidity isn’t really well known.”
Wang said that the organization already has about 20 members who work on three teams: research and development, finance and events, and publicity and public relations.
Jane Chung ’15, one of the co-chairs for the research and development team, said that she and other club members want to launch a pilot program, hopefully in partnership with the Massachusetts General Hospital, to educate Cambridge-area mothers about maintaining their health throughout and after pregnancy. “We’re really excited about the idea of creating an education curriculum, because that’s kind of lacking in maternal health,” Chung said.
Members also hope to educate mothers on the importance of receiving clinical checkups during pregnancy.
Jane Y. Suh ’14, also a co-chair for the research and development team, said that she was inspired to work with the initiative after studying global maternal mortality in a Harvard course.
She said she and other team members have been exploring ways to promote maternal nutrition worldwide, including creating a program to educate mothers about healthy eating.
“Especially in developing countries, [mothers] don’t really have access to foods or know what foods to eat to improve their own health and improve the health of their child,” she said. “We can provide awareness to these mothers and let them know what kinds of foods they should be taking.”
During the Harvard College Women’s Center’s Women’s Week this semester, the group plans to host a screening of the second part of the PBS documentary film adapted from WuDunn’s book. Following the screening, the group’s advisor, Harvard School of Public Health professor Ana Langer, will field questions on maternal health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, Harvard Square’s historic Brattle Theater continued its longstanding Valentine’s Day tradition of screening the classic American film “Casablanca.” Last night, couples of all ages packed the auditorium to immerse themselves in the timeless tale of love and war.
But others who came were a little more cynical about the film, which tells the story of Rick Blaine, an American expatriate in World War II Morocco.
“I am spending my Valentine’s Day at Rick’s American because nothing says romance like Nazis, alcoholism, and anti-fascist propaganda,” said Andrew J. Boyd ’14, referring to the nightclub and gambling den owned by Blaine.
“‘Casablanca’ has a very strong connection with the Brattle,” said Ned R. Hinkle, who has been the theater’s creative director since 2001—the same year that the annual Valentine’s Day tradition began.
For Hinkle, “Casablanca” is a personal favorite.
“It’s a little cynical and has some great humor to it, but it’s also very romantic,” Hinkle said. “It doesn’t end traditionally, which is also one of the other things that makes it a classic.”
The Brattle Theater, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year, has been screening the film since its initial release in 1942. And for a short time in the ’60s, “Casablanca” at the Brattle became a local cult phenomenon.
“It was a huge thing for Harvard undergraduates to come and watch ‘Casablanca,’” Hinkle said. “They would come in costume and say the lines along with the characters, kind of like the original ‘Rocky Horror Picture Show.’”
Last year, the Brattle Theater was unable to hold the screenings due to licensing issues; for the film’s 70th anniversary, Warner Bros. launched a celebratory re-release of the film in theaters across the nation.
Although the Brattle Theater’s tradition resumed this year, one defining landmark has disappeared.
The Casablanca Restaurant, which opened next to the theater in 1955, closed at the end of last year and will soon be succeeded by a new restaurant of a different name.
“We certainly made use of it frequently, both for taking a break from being here or taking guests that come to the theater to dinner,” Hinkle said.
“But it seems like the new owners are interested in the history of the building and of Harvard Square, so I think it will fit in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust warned that cuts to federal research funding would endanger innovation, the economy, and “intellectual life” in the United States in a speech to the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
AAAS, which publishes the journal “Science,” holds a yearly conference to bring together scientists, engineers, educators, and policymakers from around the world. Faust, who was chosen this year as one of the co-chairs for the meeting, kicked off the conference last night with a six-minute address at the Hynes Convention Center.
In welcoming the conference to Boston, Faust stressed the organization’s role in deepening human understanding and advancing the length and quality of life. She also spent a large portion of her remarks arguing for the prevention of sequestration—deep spending cuts in the federal budget scheduled to go into effect on March 1 if Congress does not agree on an alternative plan. Should lawmakers fail to arrive at a compromise, universities like Harvard—which received approximately $656 million in federal sponsorship last fiscal year—will face a severe decline in external research funding.
“Now more than ever, science must vigorously make its case,” Faust said in her speech. “It would be worse than a tragedy to waste this moment full of promise, to leave answerable questions unanswered.”
Faust also argued that besides being a “major glory of the nation’s intellectual life,” science and innovation are also important drivers of the economy.
“At this critical moment, with scientific opportunities unbounded and a golden future ahead, we must raise our voices,” Faust said. “The American Association for the Advancement of Science must work to prevent the American Congress from becoming an American Association for the Retreat of Science. We owe this to the future.”
In an interview with The Crimson last week, Faust explained that Harvard is planning for sequestration in the short term, along with longer-term federal funding cuts that may happen regardless of Congressional action.
“There is general agreement that whatever happens with sequestration, the profile for research funding from the federal government is going to be a different one going forward,” she said. “We take that as a given.”
In the long term, Faust said, some of the University’s schools might have to reconfigure their finances to adapt to decreased external funding. The School of Public Health, for example, used sponsored support for 73 percent of its operating revenue last fiscal year, according to the University’s annual financial report.
Along with Harvard’s lobbyists, Faust said that she has spent parts of the past year and a half in Washington talking to policymakers “trying to make the case why research is so important to the American future, to building human capital, to our security as a nation.”

Harvard Management Company has created a new position devoted to researching and understanding sustainability issues related to the University’s $30.7 billion endowment.
The new Vice President of Sustainable Investing will also serve as HMC’s primary liasion to other University offices on environmental, social, and governance investment issues.
HMC, which oversees Harvard’s endowment, posted a job application for the new position on its website last week. The position is listed under HMC’s compliance team, which advises the Company’s investors on legal, tax, and regulatory issues.
Jane L. Mendillo, President and CEO of HMC, said in a statement to The Crimson that the creation of the position aligns with HMC’s longterm outlook.
“Given the growing conversation around sustainability and related issues on campus and across the financial sector, we wanted to develop a more integrated approach to these issues at HMC,” Mendillo said in the statement. “We are long-term investors and that means we are concerned with sustainability and stewardship. This new position will strengthen this longstanding focus at HMC.”
Although a Harvard spokesperson has said the University “operates with a strong presumption against divestment,” the push for socially responsible investment has recently gained momentum on campus. A month after College students passed a referendum in support of a social choice fund, the University announced plans in December to create such a fund separate from its existing endowment.
Two weeks ago, five students met with members of the Harvard Corporation to discuss the details of the social choice fund, and earlier this week, a referendum to seed the social choice fund with money from Harvard’s endowment passed with 93 percent support of Harvard Kennedy School student voters.
Student members of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, which was involved in coordinating the two student referendums, expressed cautious optimism about the creation of the new HMC position.
“We were in general really pleased to see that the HMC is formally considering [environmental, social, and governance issues],” said Kevin S. Wang ’16, the investments and faculty coordinator of the Coalition.
Similarly, S. Krishna Dasaratha ’13, the Coalition’s treasurer, praised the move as an “indicator” that the University is listening to a rising chorus of student concerns about Harvard’s investment.
However, Wang and Dasaratha both said that the creation of the position, which primarily entails research on sustainable investment, does not necessarily mean that Harvard will commit to adjusting its investment strategies.
In the hopes of compelling HMC to change its investment practices, Wang said, “We’re pushing for action.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of students flocked to the Harvard Independent’s annual speed dating event Thursday night in search of love—or, for the first time this year, friendship.
The Valentine’s Day matchmaking affair, which took place in Boylston Hall’s Ticknor Lounge, featured traditional speed dates as well as the addition of platonic “speed friending.” The pairs of speed daters negotiated the terms of the date at the start of their three-minute conversations.
Angela Y. Song ’14, the president of the Independent, estimated that most students went on traditional speed dates, though some did choose to try speed friending. She said she was pleased by the overall turnout.
“I think a lot of people had a great time, and people were able to meet a lot of other people,” Song said.
Attendees enjoyed Finale chocolate ganache and blueberry cheesecake, as well as an unusually balanced gender ratio. According to Song, this year’s event drew more men than usual.
“Typically there’s been a much better female turnout, but this year there was a more balanced ratio,” Song said.
Advertising in advance of the event stressed inclusivity. Fliers and emails circulated over House lists stated that all identities were welcome, and the registration form asked students to list their contact information, preferred gender pronoun, and sexuality. Daters were not placed into separate groups at the event based on their answers.
The evening opened with a brief mingling session, and then funneled into three-minute speed dates. Daters were provided with conversations starters—including “Tina Fey or Amy Poehler?”—printed on slips of paper.
Students at the event had varying ideas about what the night might have in store.
Some said they came as a favor for their more enthusiastic roommates, but no one interviewed at the event admitted to being the roommate who actually wanted be there. Others said they came to find a date, while still some admitted they were there just for the Finale deserts.
Attendee Luke E. Sundquist ’14, who wore the number 10 on his chest, capitalized on the situation, joking that he came to “meet some friendly people [because] here they have to meet with me too.”

Last year, the Harvard women’s squash team (12-1, 6-1 Ivy) wrested the Howe Cup from Yale at the 2012 CSA National Championships. The Crimson stepped easily over its opponents, dropping only one match for a 26-1 total tally for the tournament.
This season, with title in hand, the team showed that it would not lose its momentum. Harvard has powered through a successful season with very few bumps along the way. The team now faces the challenge of defending its win on the home court of its Connecticut rival. The host of this year’s national championship, Yale (11-4, 4-3) has its eyes set on the title after last year’s second place finish.
The Crimson wrapped up its Ivy competition last weekend with a match against Yale. Though Harvard beat the Bulldogs in a comfortable 7-2 win, co-captain Sarah Mumanachit showed that the team can compete in a pinch by overtaking her opponent in the fifth game for a 3-2 win.
The Crimson enters this weekend with a near-perfect regular season record. Harvard did not let a midseason loss to Princeton (11-0, 7-0) break its stride. Looking forward, the Crimson is eager for another shot at the Tigers but will use its previous defeat to inform its approach. Co-captain Natasha Kingshott sees no reason to allow Princeton to shake the team’s confidence, should the draw pit them together.
“We have nothing to lose,” Kingshott said. “We’ve learned so much from our previous loss that we’re going to rise to the occasion.  We’re really looking forward to another shot at it.”
Undefeated on the season, the Tigers look to be a top threat to take home the title this year. Princeton dropped a 7-2 decision against Yale in last year’s national semifinals, then fell to Trinity by the same margin in the consolation round.
After this year’s regular season loss to the Tigers, Harvard rattled off seven straight wins. The team immediately trounced Hamilton and Amherst in a clean sweep and proceeded to finish the regular season without suffering another defeat.
The team benefits from strong players in every class. The talented class of 2015 is looking forward to its second opportunity to play in the national championship. They continue to support the team by supplying three out of the six players with undefeated records in the regular season, and they look to bring a new level of maturity with another season under their belts.
“We’ve matured a lot from last year,” sophomore Amanda Sobhy said. “We’ve learned from mistakes and gotten a lot [smarter] on court. We’re playing mature squash, and we’re doing a lot better.”
Though the sophomores are a tough act to follow, the class of 2016 is bringing a solid record to its first national championship. Freshman Allie Sperry went undefeated in the regular season, and her classmates played important roles in bringing about many of the team’s victories.
“The freshmen have been great,” Sobhy said. “They’ve been really great assets to the team. They’ve been working hard and they’ve been doing really well.”
In hopes of defending a national title, the Crimson is practicing at an intensity that keeps the team just under the breaking point. The team’s leadership will head up the attempt to strike the right combination.
“I think it’s a fine balance between pushing yourself at a really high, intense level, and not burning out,” Kingshott said. “Each player is taking the initiative in their individual training.”
With the national championship just a few days away, the team is sticking to business as usual.
“I don’t think we’re really changing anything,” Mumanachit said. “Now it’s just crossing our t’s and dotting our i’s.”
Harvard looks to begin this weekend’s matches with the same level of energy and intensity it has carried thus far this season.
“We’re making sure we’re hungry and [that] we’re approaching this weekend with an upward momentum,” Kingshott said. “It’s a shame we won’t have the same home support we did last year, but we’re a resilient team, and we’re going to walk into that facility ready to play in any situation, in any environment, against any opponent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend’s homestand will pit Harvard against two conference foes. First up will be a Friday night showdown against Penn. On Saturday, Harvard will take on arguably its biggest threat in the Ancient Eight, its rival Princeton. The Crimson’s basketball beat writers answer five questions about this weekend’s matchups.
1) Is Penn a sleeper threat?
DF: Although it's very hard to take a 5-17 team seriously as a 'sleeper' threat, the Crimson need to be prepared for a dogfight on Friday. A classic trap game after a tough loss and before possibly Harvard's biggest game of the season against Princeton on Saturday, the Quakers can provide trouble for the Crimson. Penn recently defeated Brown by 23 at home, the same team the Crimson needed double overtime to beat. The Quakers are not a particularly good three-point shooting team by Ivy League standards (34% as a team) but it is deep, with 11 players averaging over 13 minutes a game. Harvard is typically solid at Lavietes but will need to come out strong against a Penn opponent that’s hot off its best win of the year.
2) What are the keys to success against Princeton?
JSG: Limiting the Tigers to one shot.
Princeton averages over 46 percent from the field, second to only Harvard in the Ivy League. But turnover statistics lie in the Tigers’ favor, with the Crimson averaging two more mistakes per contest than its New Jersey counterparts. As Princeton does not cough up the ball on the regular and shoots well from the field, Harvard will need to limit its opponents chances to score by minimizing Tiger offensive rebound opportunities.
Pressure Hummer on both ends.
Princeton’s leading man, Ian Hummer, averages almost twice as many turnovers on the road as he does at Jadwin Gymnasium. Increasing the defensive pressure on the forward, especially when he has the ball, will likely lead to more of these away-game fumbles, and, as a result, transition points for Harvard. On the other end, driving to the basket both more and in a more aggressive fashion will place Hummer in a position where he may need to foul to stop an easy score. Right, all that is obvious, but what’s in it for Harvard? In the six games thus far this season that Hummer has accumulated more than four fouls, the Tigers have lost four—including one to a Yale squad that is considered much inferior. By increasing the offensive drives, Harvard will create a catch-22 for Princeton: would it rather give up easy lay-ups or risk sending its star player to the sidelines in foul trouble?
3) What can Harvard do to contain Ian Hummer?
ARM: This was a problem Coach Amaker addressed in his weekly media session on Wednesday. At 6’7,” Hummer is of comparable size to the biggest guys on Harvard’s roster. But his speed and ability to hit jump shots makes him a near-impossible for the Crimson’s interior defenders, like Jonah Travis and Steve Moundou-Missi, who will be needed in the paint to combat the rest of Princeton’s sizable front line. Wesley Saunders and Laurent Rivard, both 6’5,” are other possible candidates to check Hummer, though they’ll be hard-pressed to counter his raw strength in the post. Amaker said that defending Hummer wouldn’t come down to the efforts of one player, but would require total team defense, with everyone chipping in and being aware of him at all times. How they defend Hummer might also depend on the results of Friday’s game against Penn; perhaps the fresher bodies with more energy to expend will take the bulk of the assignment.
4) Who will come up big for Harvard this weekend?
CEC: It’s more of a question of who needs to come up big, rather than who definitely will.
Although Crimson coach Tommy Amaker made it clear at this week’s press conference that the Penn game is a point of focus for his team, there is no doubt that the biggest Ivy League matchup of the weekend is Harvard v. Princeton—a contest that pits the conference’s top two teams against each other for the first time this season. And given the significance of that matchup, the Crimson needs to step up its interior defense against the Tigers.
I’m sure, by now, you’re heard of this guy Ian Hummer—the Princeton forward who, along with Crimson sophomore Wesley Saunders, is a frontrunner from Ancient Eight Player of the Year honors. Hummer averages 15.7 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game. And his presence inside, coupled with the fact that the entire Tigers’ lineup stands at least 6’5” (for comparison, the 6’6” Jonah Travis is Harvard’s biggest starter), means a tall task for the Crimson squad.
For Harvard to come out on top Saturday night, it’s going to need a huge game from the sophomore trio of Jonah Travis, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Kenyatta Smith down low.
5) Is this weekend make-or-break for Harvard?
MK: Yes and no. Harvard can drop a contest this weekend and still control its destiny. That being said, if the Crimson falls to Princeton, Harvard will likely need to top the Tigers on the road—a feat it hasn’t accomplished since 1989.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kenyatta Smith had been waiting 80 days for another opportunity.
That’s how long it had been since the Harvard sophomore was pulled from the starting lineup following the men’s basketball team’s 85-78 loss to Vermont, a game in which he had committed three turnovers and three fouls.
Smith spent most of the Crimson’s next 15 games watching from the bench, as Harvard went 11-4 with sophomore Jonah Travis starting at center.
But following the Crimson’s 78-63 loss at Columbia last Saturday, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker decided to give Smith another chance. At Wednesday’s practice, Amaker informed the team that Smith would replace Travis in the lineup for the Crimson’s Friday night matchup against Penn.
“I was a little nervous,” Smith said of his reaction when he learned of Amaker’s decision. “I didn’t want to let [Amaker] down. He had a lot of faith in me. He told me that he was counting on me. I didn’t want to let him down. I didn’t want to let my team down.”
Smith certainly didn’t do that.
In an historic night, the 6’8” center posted 20 points, nine rebounds, and 10 blocks—all career highs and the latter a program record. The performance spurred the Crimson (15-7, 7-1 Ivy) to a 73-54 victory over Penn (6-18, 3-4), Harvard’s most comfortable conference win of the season.
“I made the decision to go with [Smith] because we needed an inside, interior presence for scoring and certainly his rebounding ability,” Amaker said. “I never anticipated him getting 10 blocks, but we need him to protect our rim.”
Thanks in large part to Smith’s interior presence, Penn struggled to get into a rhythm offensively, scoring just 54 points on 34.9 percent shooting—its third lowest clip of the season.
Quakers guards Miles Cartwright and Tony Hicks, who entered the contest averaging 14 and 12 points per game in Ivy League play, respectively, were limited to just 15 combined points on five-of-21 shooting from the field.
“I was very pleased with our defense,” Amaker said. “I thought we played an exceptional game defensively in pretty much both halves, which is something we haven’t really done all year. I thought we had great discipline, great focus.”
On the other side of the court, the Crimson was efficient on offense, connecting on 52.3 percent of its shots from the floor and five-of-13 from deep.
Coming off a career-high 27-point performance in last Saturday’s loss at Columbia, sophomore Wesley Saunders continued to fill the basket on Friday. The 6’5” wing posted 17 first-half points and finished with 23, a game high.
“Obviously Wesley was very efficient with how he played,” said Amaker of the sophomore, who shot seven-of-12 from the field and got to the charity stripe 11 times.
With the score knotted at 9-9 early in the first half, Saunders sparked a 14-4 Harvard run, knocking down a triple from the left wing off a pass from co-captain Christian Webster.
After Penn’s Darien Nelson-Henry finished a layup to pull the Quakers within one, sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi answered for the Crimson with his first bucket of the game.
On the other end, Saunders came up with a steal, and then, with the shot clock expiring, found Webster in the corner. The senior hit the shot with a hand in his face, putting the Crimson up, 17-11.
Following a Dau Jok missed three-pointer, Moundou-Missi drilled a jumper from the left baseline to put Harvard up eight. After the teams traded points, Saunders gave the Crimson its first double-digit lead off a deep two.
The Quakers cut Harvard’s lead to eight with 2:31 remaining in the first half off a Patrick Lucas-Perry triple, but Saunders stuck a step-back jumper from the right elbow over Cartwright’s outstretched hand with four ticks remaining to tally his 17th point of the half and put the Crimson up 10 at the break.
Harvard extended its lead coming out of halftime
After the Quakers pulled within nine with 19:09 remaining, the Crimson rattled off a 17-6 run fueled by a balanced attack featuring four points from Saunders, four from Smith, three from Webster, three from junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, and three from rookie point guard Siyani Chambers.
Smith’s bucket with 12:57 to go put the Crimson up by 20, 57-37.
And unlike in past contests in which Harvard has let large leads slip away, the Crimson hung on, its advantage never dipping below 15 the rest of the way.

For 51 straight conference games, No. 9 Penn State had dominated its EIVA foes. But that streak came to an end Friday night against the Crimson.
The Harvard men’s volleyball team got revenge against this conference rival in a historic victory at the Malkin Athletic Center. With the win, the Crimson (6-2, 2-1 EIVA) beat the Nittany Lions (9-3, 3-1 EIVA) for the first time in school history.  Harvard’s three set sweep of Penn State marks the first time the Nittany Lions have lost a conference game in almost five years.
With a two set advantage, Harvard took a 19-13 lead in the third set before Penn State clawed its way back to make it 24-23.  The large home crowd rose to its feet to watch what would be the final point of the match, another kill from sophomore outside hitter DJ White, who had a team-high 13 on the day.
The Crimson knew it could compete with the Nittany Lions, having taken them to five sets each of the last two times the squads had played.
“We had watched a lot of tape,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said.  “We knew what they were going to do on offense and we knew that they had so many good hitters that we needed to slow them down somehow.  We blocked well, and our defensive back row was great.”
White and junior libero Chris Gibbons helped lead Harvard’s strong defense as they recorded five digs apiece.  Sophomore Caleb Zimmick led the team in blocks with five.
“We just took time to relax [in practice this week],” freshman hitter Branden Clemens said. “We took the time to go back and focus on the fundamentals, polish everything, and get back on our game.”
The Crimson also delivered a strong offensive performance, recording a .457 hitting percentage that was its best mark of the season.
“I thought we played an extraordinary match,” Baise said. “We made so few errors.
Our passers did a great job, which was the main thing.”
Harvard was coming off of a sloppy victory over Rivier on Feb. 5th, and it knew it would have to play better to earn a win against Penn State.
“I give the team a lot of credit,” co-captain Rob Lothman said.  “I give coach a lot of credit for leading us in practice, and making [us] really fight everyday in practice this week like we were playing these guys tonight. I think that really showed on the court.”
The Crimson rolled in the second set, jumping out to a 12-6 lead.  It would maintain the lead throughout the second set, winning it with ease, 25-17.
“[After the second set] we called everyone in,” the senior setter said. “And said, ‘This is the set we need to take. We cannot let this go four sets. We cannot let down and have a mental lapse right now.’ And we went out and executed.”
After falling down 16-13 in the first set, Harvard came out of a timeout and rattled off five straight points to take control. It went on to win the third frame, 25-23.
“It was one of those matches where everything we were working on in practice came together,” Baise said. “All our passing and all our serving, I mean really everything, came through. We really executed in every one of those areas tonight.”
Lothman tallied 40 assists on the night, while his co-captain Nick Madden had ten kills from his opposite hitter position.
“[The most important thing] was just making the small plays,” Lothman said. “Covering blocks and picking up junk digs on defense, making your serves and not serving out if the last person served out.”
The MAC was packed Friday to witness one of the program’s best victories, with 550 people in attendance.
“I have never had a crowd like that since I have been here,” the senior said. “We have had some big crowds, but I have never been in the atmosphere where people are crowded around the railings. It feels kind of like a pit, which is really a great atmosphere.”
The Nittany Lion offense sputtered all night, as the combination of stingy defense from the Crimson and sloppy offensive play led to only a .244 hitting percentage for Penn State.
“I think [the crowd] is probably worth a couple of points in the series of a match,” Lothman said. “When the crowd is in their head that way, it forces the other team to make some unforced errors that they otherwise wouldn’t.”
Harvard viewed Friday’s victory as more than just an upset, but as a historical marker for past and future matches.
“So I would say it is probably the best we have ever played as a unit,” Lothman said. “And with a team like that, when you beat them, it is going to be up there as one of the top games in Harvard history as far as men’s volleyball is concerned.”

A second-half deficit of 15 points proved too much to overcome as the Harvard women’s basketball team fell to the University of Pennsylvania, 77-72, at the Palestra on Friday night. The Crimson had not lost to the Quakers on the road since 2001 and had held a 17-game win streak against its Ivy foes prior to Friday’s loss.
Harvard (13-7, 4-2 Ivy) was led by sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who eclipsed a personal best of 20 points set two weeks ago against Yale with a team-high 26 points for the night. Rookie Keiera Ray lit up the backcourt for Penn (10-9, 3-2) with 31 points.
“This was the game of [Ray’s] life,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “The kid drove. We just didn’t play her right. You’ve got to stop the drive and not send her to the line. It was bizarre. We played in favor of her—not to take away from her night—she played a great ball game. I’ll be interested to look at the tapes to see what we can do to not let that happen again.”
The freshman guard is the second-leading scorer for the Quakers, netting an average of 10.4 points per game.
“We expected someone else to be the go-to person for them,” Fagbenle said. “Obviously for a team like that, they can change positions and leadership. I guess that girl stepped up and we just didn’t do what we needed to do to stop her, which is terrible. We can’t let anyone go off like that against us.”
It was a banner night for Fagbenle, who dominated on the glass, pulling down a game-high 13 boards and recording her fourth career double-double. This was the fourth consecutive contest in which she has netted double-digit points.
“I didn’t even know I had those stats until someone told me,” Fagbenle said. “For me it doesn’t matter at all, especially if we lose.”
Fagbenle was joined by senior forward Victoria Lippert, who had 13 points for the night, as the only two players to put up double digit figures in any measure for the visiting squad.
Harvard fought from behind in both frames, but was unable to close the gap for a win. With just under 10 minutes to go in the game, Penn guard Alyssa Baron drove into the paint for a fastbreak lay-up that put her team on top by 15 points. All was not over for the Crimson, which went on a 14-0 run over the next five minutes to cut the Quaker lead to one. Fagbenle provided eight points during the scoring spree.
“I just think we came together,” Fagbenle said. “We didn’t stop persevering. We played our offense and stopped them from scoring. When you have those two, we get more points. That’s kind of like feel good basketball, [having] a little fun.”
The two teams quickly traded threes, with Lippert drilling a trey seconds after Penn’s Kathleen Roche sunk one from behind the arc. In the end, Harvard gave up six points from the charity stripe in the final 40 seconds, letting the Quakers pull off a win.
“We staged a nice comeback in the second half to erase the 15-point lead but we just fell short at the end,” Delaney-Smith said.
The Crimson fell behind early in the game, trailing by as many as eight points during the first period.
Down 17-12 with 10:44 left in the opening half, free throws from Fagbenle and junior guard Christine Clark, sandwiching a three from senior guard Elle Hagedorn, brought the score to 19-19.  Fagbenle followed with a lay-up to give her team its first lead. But Harvard was unable to stay ahead, letting Penn sink three from deep to hold an edge, 30-22. The Crimson rallied for nine more points in the next three and a half minutes and went into the locker room down by three, 34-31.
While Harvard out-rebounded the Quakers, 43-34, the team struggled to keep its hands on the ball, turning it over 17 times and yielding 26 points off these errors.
“We shouldn’t have 17 turnovers at this point in the season,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s something that we have to figure out how to control better. Seventeen isn’t awful but I really feel we’re a good enough team to have under 15. They’re a very physical team. We were supposed to be ready for that but I think the physicality bothered us a little bit in the first half.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Without its leading freshman scorer for the second straight game, the Harvard men’s hockey team once again turned to its seniors to provide an offensive spark. They did.
Three goals from senior forwards—one from assistant captain Alex Fallstrom and two from Marshall Everson—lifted the Crimson (7-15-2, 4-12-1 ECAC) to a 4-1 win over Colgate (13-12-4, 5-9-3 ECAC) at the Bright Hockey Center on Friday evening.  Harvard picked up its first in-conference victory since Nov. 16.
“There’s been a lot of frustration, quite honestly, over the last couple of months, and they could almost taste a victory,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think there were some real big plays in the game that we lacked earlier in the season.”
Everson posted two markers less than four minutes apart in the back-half of the second period to provide Harvard a two-goal advantage.
More than 11 minutes into the second frame, a rebound from freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo pinballed off the leg of Everson as the senior crashed the crease. The strike put the Crimson up, 2-1.
Moments later, Everson received a Criscuolo feed from the right-wing boards before deking the puck past Colgate freshman goaltender Spencer Finney.
“Criscuolo made an incredible pass to me,” Everson said of his second goal. “I thought [Finney] might be reading a one-timer, so I just wanted to hold it for a second there and try to get him out of position.”
After a scoreless first period in which the Raiders outshot Harvard, 10-5, the Crimson opened the second firing on all cylinders. Fallstrom slid the puck under the pads of a scrambling Finney less than one minute into the frame as Harvard bombarded the net.
“We started slow in the game, so in between periods we had to start to take control,” Everson said. “We had to get back to our game plan of getting the puck in deep and trying to forecheck. I think when we started doing that and simplifying our game, we saw the successes come.”
Colgate took little time to respond to Fallstrom’s goal, immediately peppering junior goaltender Raphael Girard with shots following the score. The Raiders broke through on the man advantage as Billy Rivellini converted on a tick-tack passing play.
But Harvard quickly found itself in the driver’s seat again. Everson’s goals put the contest out of reach as the Colgate attack collapsed down the stretch. Girard finished with a game-high 27 saves.
“We did what we needed to do,” Donato said. “I thought we played pretty intelligently in the third period, outside of the fact that we had some penalty trouble. We didn’t turn the puck over and made good plays to get it out and get it in and allowed [Girard] to see the puck most of the time.”
The Raiders managed only four shots on goal in the final frame despite three power plays. A clear from junior defender Dan Ford skidded into an empty net with less than 30 seconds left in regulation for the Crimson’s fourth goal of the night.
Harvard has played the last two games without sharp-shooting freshman forward Jimmy Vesey, who is out with a lower body injury. Yet in each of those two games, veterans have provided an extra scoring punch.
“Obviously Jimmy’s an important part of our team and one that we hope to have back,” Donato said. “We’ve had some guys step up, and I think we’re getting more guys involved. More guys are hitting their stride a little bit. It’s a good time of the year to do it.”
The first three goals of the night required video review. Officials examined and cleared Everson’s game-winner for any kicking motion that could have propelled the puck into the net.
“I saw [the puck] come off the pad and was hoping that it would hit me somewhere in the body and go in,” Everson said. “I didn’t want to touch it with my hand, didn’t want to kick it in. Just hoped my body’s momentum would carry it in.”
With its 7-4 win over Boston University on Monday, Harvard earned its first pair of back-to-back wins since beating RPI, 4-0, and Cornell, 4-1, on Nov. 10 and Nov. 16, respectively. The Crimson’s last three games comprise its longest unbeaten streak of the season.
“I think our guys certainly played with a greater level of desperation,” Donato said. “That’s something we want to continue to improve upon.”

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
February 14, 1919: Down To Earth.
In the February issue of the "Bookman" is published an article entitled "Detestable Words." This gives a few examples of words which the editor despises. According to the "Bookman," "sense" appears as a verb in every form from the "father sensed his son's abstraction" to the "peeling infant sensed the coming of the succulent milk-bottle." "Poignant" is on the blacklist because of its downright stupidity, "stipend" because of its oily politician sound. "Remuneration" is a foolishly long latinized word, and "dainty" and "refined" are classed as belonging to the "chewing gum" variety.
To this admirable list perhaps we can add a few others which it has been our own misfortune to observe. On one tragic occasion, we accepted an editorial which mentioned something as one of the most "enjoyable" features of college life. Another time we solemnly declared that the University "rejoices in the fact," etc. We defy the ability of anyone to picture in his mind the University rejoicing. Once again, read of a man over-come by a "virulent obsession"--whatever that may mean.
February 11, 1950: Editor Calls UWF Plan World Hope
"We must preserve the human race at all costs," said Craig Wylie '80 last night in stressing the need for a world government to prevent otherwise certain destruction of humanity.
Before more than 100 United World Federalist student delegates in Sever Hall, the Houghton Mifflin editor cited the duty of World Federalists to work toward an international government eventually including every nation. The first step for such a government is the control of armament. Civil legislation will come gradually later.
February 15, 1950: Over 800 Students Plan Journeys Abroad Via NSA Summer Program
More than 800 students will go abroad this summer on National Student Association tours. Final plans for these trips have been made and deadlines for applications set for March 8.
Sailings for the Study, Seminar, and Workcamp Tours are scheduled for June 26 on the S.S. Volendam, leaving from Quebec and bound for Rotterdam. The groups will be back in New York September 15. Some students will fly across the ocean in charter planes operated by regularly scheduled airlines.
February 16, 1962: College Organizations Recommend Sit-In Demonstrations in Maryland
The Boston Co-ordinating Committee of the Northern Student Movement is urging students of Harvard, Radcliffe, and other colleges in the Boston vicinity to participate in sit-in demonstrations to be conducted in Maryland next week-end.
At Harvard, the Young Democrats, the Liberal Union, the Congregational-presbyterian Fellowship and the Republican Advance for Equal Opportunity have endorsed the project and anticipate participation by their members.
At a special meeting held last night, the YDCHR passed a resolution of support for the sit-ins but urged that no picketing be included, nor placards carried. A spokesman for the organization noted that it was hoped that the demonstrations would be as peaceful and orderly as possible. Picketing, he said, could conceivably threaten such orderliness.
February 14, 1978: You Can Save Harvard... Or You Can Turn the Page
Did you ever wonder why a great college like Harvard is screwed up in so many little ways?
Did you curse silently (silently since nobody listens anyway) because the College has no optional meal plan and you pay for meals you don't eat?
Or because undergraduates are charged $10 an hour to play tennis?
Or because the stodgy old Law School could change its calendar but we can't?
Or because there are not enough reserve books in Lamont or free toilet paper for the River Houses—or because the deans make up students' minds with only token input from an amorphous alphabet-soup-bowl-full of so-called student-faculty committees?
Or because the CUE Guide no longer gives grading statistics and the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility does not have the resources to prevent Harvard from selling its corporate soul to the highest bidder?
Or because we are the only major college you know of without a student center?
Do you ever wonder why we don't have a student government association?
Perhaps the answer to the first ten problems above is contained in the answer to the last question. Don't you find it odd that Harvard is probably the only college in the United States without some form of central student government? Even the graduate and professional schools at Harvard have student associations. We do not.

So you haven't done the readings, and you've been too busy constantly refreshing your Gmail in lecture to even know if your professor is a male, female, or just a potted plant. But you don't want your section TF to know this— that would kill your participation grade! So here are a few tips critical to surviving section.
1. Look Prepared
Camp out in the classroom early so that you can be there right when class starts. Stay there overnight if you have to. You may look over-eager—but that's what you are going for. If you get bored waiting you can take a nap in the tent you brought, or make s'mores!
2. Bring Your Readings
Pull out all your books, not just for one section, but also for all of your classes; it will look like you've been doing outside research or at the very least did your readings. If your readings are all online, bring your favorite fiction book or dirty magazine. If you get enough books your can build a barrier between you and your TF to hide behind when he asks a hard question.
3. Be Expressive
If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a facial expression is worth at least five comments in section and half a response paper. Given that, you should always react to what your TF says. If she asks if you have done the reading, nod enthusiastically. If she summarizes a point, nod enthusiastically. When she asks a challenging question about the chemical bonds of methane, nod enthusiastically.
4. Pronounce things
If any of your authors have French-sounding names, or your reading references a Latin phrase, memorize it and pull it out during section. You will look well-read and cultured when you drop Foucault's name or the term a priori during your Government or Chem 40 section.
5. Office Hours
Go. Especially if your TF is hot. If he or she isn't particularly good looking—hey, the odds are even more in your favor.
