After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You know that moment when you pick up a magazine, take a little personality quiz, and then decide to get a divorce? Yeah, we’ve all been there.
And if you can believe it, celebrities are just like you and me. Singer-songwriter Adele recently shared that one of these quizzes proved the motivation behind her 2018 separation from former partner Simon Konecki in “Adele One Night Only” — a television special that aired late last year on CBS. In addition to performances of songs both old and new, the special featured an interview conducted by talk show host Oprah Winfrey, who dove deep into the superstar’s six-year hiatus from releasing music. Thanks to Winfrey’s rigorous investigative reporting, the public is now privy to the juicy details of Adele’s divorce, and the details are… relatable? Maybe?
It depends on how much faith you place in personality quizzes. Adele shared that she came across such a quiz while reading a magazine with friends. The question “What’s something that no one would ever know about you?” precipitated the realization that the performer wasn’t happy with her life, much to her friends’ surprise. Apparently, one person’s trivial entertainment is another’s life-altering wake-up call.
In the interview, Adele also expressed feeling far removed from the person she was when she married Konecki and out of touch with herself and life; marriage was simply standing in the way of her well-being. In one light, the story behind Adele’s divorce is a little sad, a little amusing, and mostly forgettable within five minutes of reading the headline. In another light, I implore you to see that the tale of Adele and the magazine personality quiz is actually quite inspiring.
Many let self-care and understanding fall to the wayside all too often these days, only to keep “plodding along,” in Adele’s words. Who am I to judge her openness and profound sense of self-awareness? We should be grateful for moments of unexpected reflection, regardless of what inspires them, and feel empowered by the courage it took for Adele to put herself first.
Seizing life by the horns takes some serious bravery, especially when one begins contemplating the steps that led them to their current station. But there may be forces beyond these earthly confines conspiring against us: Adele warned that her Saturn return — the astrological phenomenon in which the planet returns to its elliptical longitude at the time of one’s birth, usually occurring around the age of 30 — may be partly responsible for her recent malaise. This astral event is associated with experiencing the trials and tribulations of adulthood for the first time, which Adele relates in her newest studio album (aptly titled “30”).
I don’t think I’m ready to die on a hill of horoscopes. The bottom line: Next time you’re hanging out with friends and spot that magazine, just give your spouse a call before flipping to the personality quiz section.
I kid, I kid. The real bottom line: Prepare for your Saturn return.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 4, director Jon M. Chu announced that Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande had been cast in the upcoming movie adaptation of the Broadway musical “Wicked.” Erivo and Grande were cast in the main roles of Elphaba and Glinda, respectively. The casting announcement was met with both praise and criticism from fans.
“Wicked,” which retells the story of the Wicked Witch of the West from “The Wizard of Oz,” is one of the most beloved and longest-running musicals on Broadway. For most stage shows that reach this level of fame — such as “The Phantom of the Opera” and “Les Misérables” — the inevitable next step is a movie adaptation, thus extending the film’s reach past the insulated world of live theatre and reinforcing its position in the public consciousness.
But despite having opened more than fifteen years ago, “Wicked” has never been adapted for the screen, although that’s not for lack of trying. A movie adaptation of “Wicked” was first confirmed in 2015, and since then, the production has hit several roadblocks. With a release date that was constantly being pushed back, a changing creative team, and no casting announcements in sight, fans became skeptical that a “Wicked” movie was going to happen at all, until Erivo and Grande’s casting was confirmed earlier this month.
The casting of Erivo, a Tony Award-winning actress and singer, was largely received positively. Erivo already has experience both onstage and onscreen, having played the leading role in “The Color Purple” on Broadway as well as the title character of the movie “Harriet.” Her resume, along with her impressive vocal skills, makes her an uncontroversial pick for the iconic role of Elphaba.
Grande’s casting, on the other hand, was met with mixed reactions. While she did perform on Broadway as a teenager, playing a small role in the musical “13,” Grande has spent the bulk of her career as a pop star. Although Grande is clearly a talented vocalist, a number of Glinda’s songs require a classically influenced sound — a vocal style that Grande has rarely, if ever, showcased. It’s certainly possible that she has the ability to pull it off, but as there are next to no recordings of her singing in an operatic style, she’ll have to prove it.
Not all the attention during the “Wicked” casting announcement was on Grande, though. Less than four days after the official release, a Change.org petition was started to keep James Corden out of the “Wicked” movie. The “Late Late Show” host’s appearance in seemingly every new movie musical — including “Cats,” “The Prom,” and “Cinderella” — has led to the public quickly getting tired of him.
“James Corden in no way shape or form should be in or near the production of Wicked the movie,” the petition reads. As of Nov. 18, it has collected over 94,000 signatures.
This vehement mass dislike of James Corden is an interesting development. It was long believed that movie musicals needed to cast well-known Hollywood actors to garner enough public interest for the movie to be a success. For example, Julie Andrews was passed over for Audrey Hepburn in the film version of “My Fair Lady,” despite Andrews having originated the role on Broadway, because Hepburn was more of a household name than Andrews was at the time. Hepburn couldn’t properly sing her part, and her voice was dubbed in the film by Marni Nixon.
“Wicked” seems to be operating by a similar principle — casting a well-known celebrity to boost sales — in casting Ariana Grande, one of the world’s biggest pop stars, as opposed to a professional Broadway actress. But this petition against James Corden is showing that people just aren’t as receptive to celebrity casting as the creative team may think. A famous name on a movie poster isn’t a draw if the chosen celebrity isn’t someone the public likes.
So what led to this preemptive backlash against James Corden’s potential casting? People are finally getting annoyed with how celebrity casting in movie musicals seems like a quick cash grab, particularly when such casting makes no sense. For example, “Cats” had a star-studded and frankly confusing cast of names from Taylor Swift to yes, James Corden, and that didn’t stop it from suffering from rushed CGI, poor box office sales, and general public ridicule. In fact, poor casting arguably made the movie worse. Movie musicals have largely become a vehicle for celebrity hubris, which is disappointing given the genre’s potential for rich and genuine storytelling.
If anyone should understand why musicals don’t need celebrity casting, it would be director Jon M. Chu. His 2021 adaptation of the musical “In the Heights” largely avoided stunt-casting, instead relying on elements such as set design, choreography, and Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical score, and the movie was well-received — which is why Grande’s casting in “Wicked” is so singularly frustrating. “Wicked” doesn’t need a celebrity’s name attached to it to be successful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson men’s basketball team returned to Lavietes Pavilion this Friday hoping to re-establish the home court advantage it enjoyed prior to the winter break.
Coming into the game, Harvard (10-7, 2-3 Ivy) sat at an even .500 record in Ivy League play after dropping its most recent contest to Cornell, a 76-61 affair on Jan. 22. Penn (8-12, 5-2 Ivy), on the other hand, entered Lavietes sitting third in the conference with a 4-2 record.
Plagued with injuries to juniors Chris Ledlum and Idan Tretout — both of whom were mainstays in coach Tommy Amaker’s starting lineup — the Crimson had to make up for significant scoring and rebounding.
Prior to his injury, Ledlum was the fourth-leading scorer in the Ivy League, contributing 16.7 points to go along with a conference-best 9.3 rebounds a game. Tretout’s 8.5 points along with three rebounds per contest were missing as well, putting an even heavier load on the already-depleted roster.
Harvard opened up the game strong with five quick points from junior guard Luka Sakota, who looked comfortable hitting deep jumpshots early.  The Crimson jumped out to a 12-2 lead over the Quakers following good defensive possessions, including a drawn charge by freshman guard Denham Wojcik—who would go on to draw another in the contest.
Harvard saw the return of senior forward Mason Forbes, who was playing for the first time since the Crimson’s Jan. 7 contest against Brown. Forbes had an immediate impact, scoring four quick points down low and establishing a presence on the glass.
“I was really excited for us to have Mason back and have him out on the floor,” said Amaker about the Folsom, Calif. native.  “[His] energy early in the first half was tremendous.”
The defensive effort was evident early on, as Harvard held Penn two for seven from the three-point line midway through the first half. Coming into the contest, Amaker emphasized the team’s need to improve transition defense and communication, hoping to turn around its poor second-half showing in the previous contest.
Offensively, the Crimson were led by Kirkwood, whose 16 first-half points were one shy of his Ivy League third-best 17.3 point average. The Ottawa, Ont., native reached this first-half mark efficiently, making seven of his 12 attempts in the first period of play.
The defensive dominance began to wane as the first half progressed, however, as Penn sophomore guard Jordan Dingle began to find his groove on offense. Dingle entered the contest as the second-leading scorer in the Ivy League, averaging 18.7 points per game. The Ivy League Rookie of the Year, along with sophomore forward Max Martz and junior guard Lucas Monroe, led the Quakers in cutting the Harvard lead to four points with four minutes to play in the half.
The Penn run, coupled with a cold Crimson offensive streak, saw the Quakers take the lead with three minutes remaining. After being down 12 earlier in the half, Penn began settling into its offensive strengths—running offensive possessions through Dingle and making its way to the free throw line. Dingle easily maneuvered through the court, getting shots off behind the arc as well as driving to the basket, looking to draw fouls. He had 23 points at half on six made field goals.
Harvard, on the other hand, scored only once in the final four minutes of the period. After a dominant start, the Crimson faced a seven-point deficit going into the second half of play.
Looking for solutions on the defensive front, Amaker’s squad entered a 2-3 zone in hopes of throwing off the dangerous Quaker offense. The zone saw some success early, forcing a couple of bad shots. As play continued, however, Dingle began successfully penetrating the defense and dishing out assists to open teammates.
With the Penn lead at 12, Harvard was in dire need of an offensive spark. Catchings, who scored only two points in the first half of play, found his rhythm from behind the arc at the perfect time — going on an 8-0 run by himself. Following another Penn miss, first-year guard Evan Nelson took the ball the length of the court to convert an and-one opportunity, erupting the previously-tame Lavietes crowd.
The 11-0 run tied the game at 53 with a little over half a period left to play. With the crowd getting back into it, the Crimson looked as dominant as it had been out of the gate. However, immediately following the run, Harvard’s two key weaknesses emerged.
Despite early foul trouble from Penn putting Harvard in the bonus early, the Crimson failed to take advantage of its opportunities at the charity stripe, missing the front-end on three one-and-ones. Overall, Harvard went 9-14 from the line in the second half and 11-18 in total. On the other end, Penn finished 17-20 from the free throw line, making important shots down the stretch.
“Looking at the statsheet, I think it’s obvious where the shortcomings were for us in a game like this, when we shoot 11 for 20 from the foul line,” said Amaker after the game. “It’s hard to overcome that when you’re trying to make up ground and get back in the game. Give [Penn] credit, they did make the free throws when they needed to.”
On the defensive end, issues in transition emerged as the Quakers were able to capitalize on fastbreaks. Missing its rebounding force in Ledlum, Harvard also let up eight offensive boards in the second half.
The Crimson managed to remain within single digits following the Catchings-led run, trading baskets with Penn as the half continued. A layup off of an inbounds pass by sophomore guard Sam Silverstein cut the Quaker lead to four with 27 seconds remaining.
Following free throws by both teams, the Penn lead grew to five with sixteen seconds left on the clock. It was at this time that the Crimson entrusted the ball to Sakota, who had come up clutch for Harvard in big moments earlier this year.
Launching a three well behind the arc with hopes of keeping the game alive, Sakota struck once again. Lavietes exploded as the Penn lead was cut to two.
“Luka is having a good scoring year for us,” said Amaker regarding Sakota’s role on offense this season. “I think there’s a confidence there within him and with his teammates that he is going to score and make some shots for us.”
However, Penn’s clutch free throw shooting prevailed. Martz and sophomore guard Clark Slajchert remained unwavered during their trips to the line—sinking shots to put the Quakers up four with four seconds to play. Sakota’s desperation heave failed to connect, and Penn managed to scrape out another tally in the Ivy League win column.
Falling below the .500 mark in conference play, the Crimson has little room for error in its remaining schedule. Harvard is looking to secure a top-four spot in order to advance to postseason play and the Ivy League tournament at Lavietes Pavilion. Crucial contests against Brown and Yale lie ahead, and Catchings emphasized the importance of moving on after this loss.
“Next weekend we have two huge games, a revenge matchup against Brown and then Yale who has had a really good Ivy season thus far,” the co-captain said. “We just gotta keep moving forward, keep building on what we’ve done and just not get down on ourselves.”
Harvard will face off against Brown and Yale on Feb. 4 and 5, respectively, looking to steal a couple of games on the road and get back on track in the conference.
