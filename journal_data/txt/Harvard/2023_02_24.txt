After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the life of an average college student, one frequently encounters the classic coffee shop aesthetic: deep warm colors and cool neutrals, design or photography books, generously applied plants, reclaimed wood, and hanging Edison light bulbs.
Every day, many Harvard students shuffle into Bluestone Lane, use their BoardPlus at Barker Cafe, or grab lunch at Flour Bakery. With all our frequent stops at campus and beyond’s coffee shops, one can’t help but wonder at this classic coffee shop aesthetic and the changing of neighborhoods it seems to herald.
In the 18th century, writers like Joseph Addison and Richard Steele wrote of coffee houses as the centers of public, intellectual life. In the late 1900s, however, the American second wave of coffee reconceptualized the beverage from intellectual fuel to a luxury experience; a small, upstart coffee shop in Seattle would help ship this movement to the rest of the United States, and then the world.
That coffee shop was Starbucks.
The open, industrial style of Starbucks and later third-wave coffee shops contrasted with the clean, basic style of past large chains. To meet legal requirements for their specialized equipment, they occupied former factories and industrial buildings. By incorporating a minimalist aesthetic, devoid of vibrant colors and distracting symbolism, they directed focus toward the product they produced. Suddenly, the barista became the sommelier, the owner of a trained palette, who could, with a sip, differentiate notes and roasts, and pin down the corner of the world any coffee bean belonged to.
The transformation of coffee into an item of luxury also made the drink, and the places it inhabited, more expensive. Every new coffee shop introduced in a given year is associated with a 0.5 percent increase in housing prices in its zip code.
A more recent trend — the rise of digital nomadism, the practice of remote working with frequent traveling — is bringing this gentrification worldwide. Through companies like Outsite, digital nomads can buy memberships for living. Roughly $1,700 a month entitles a remote worker to a private room in Tulum, Mexico, or another city, ultimate freedom of movement, and a place in an on-site coffee shop.
Digital nomads need only a stable Internet connection to fuel their lifestyle. Constantly traveling, they’re likely to gravitate toward the comfort of familiar tastes, language, and aesthetics — particularly in this more stable, post-pandemic era. Four-dollar espresso shots become the cost of rent for a modular office space that can move anywhere a laptop fits. As digital nomadism attracts more and more converts, who proliferate through cities and raise their real estate prices, the unified design elements of the modern coffee shops they haunt serve as a strong bidirectional symbol of worldwide gentrification.
As college students, including myself, continue to frequent coffee shops on campus, across the Square, and beyond, it’s important to remember what influences design elements hold. With the welcoming, collective aesthetic of modern coffee shops often comes a justification for raised prices — and gentrification.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have been meaning to write this piece for over a year.
Most journalists, most writers, have that — a piece that got away. A seemingly brilliant short story pitch that, never having touched the page, remains but boundless potential; an in-depth investigation that sourcing, timing, or sharply limited attention spans prevented from materializing. Tales big and small that, for one reason or another, slipped between the cracks, falling into some inaccessible mental crevice like loose change in a worn-out leather couch. Never to be seen, never to be told.
This is a sketch of one such story, one I never got to write when I first penned a column for The Crimson and threw myself to the consistently depressing endeavor of analyzing the moral character of the donors who bless our halls with their hollow philanthropy. The story of Lakshmi Mittal, the billionaire endower of Harvard’s Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute — and my own personal journalistic loose change.
***
Within the pantheon of questionable Harvard donors, Mittal strikes me as a particularly fascinating little monster. The British-based Indian billionaire, once dubbed Europe’s wealthiest man, sits atop (and, before passing the baton to his son, served as CEO of) ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producer outside of China. His isn’t a single damning story but rather a tangle thereof — a collection of implicating reports, rumors, and anecdotes. An incriminating web so vast in scope and breadth that a full account would require not a weekly column but a thick, thoroughly annotated encyclopedic volume.
Let’s, for the sake of brevity and my editors’ sanity, zoom into a single useful example — one that starts with a secret letter and caps off with toxic, black snowfall.
Bucharest, Romania. July 20, 2001: Mittal’s company, then LNM holdings, finds itself at risk of missing out on the acquisition of a prominent Romanian state-owned steel plant. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is thought to be pressuring the Romanian government to choose French rival bidders. Having failed to secure the deal, Mittal flies from Bucharest to London. Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair had ties to Mittal — a prominent donor who had supported his Labour party in the 1997 elections and extended a check for £125,000 only weeks prior. Blair, despite initial statements to the contrary, was almost certainly aware that Mittal was a prominent Labour benefactor with mile-deep pockets; roughly a month prior, the two had attended the same thank-you party for Labour donors at an elegant London mansion.
Within three days, as Jospin arrives in Bucharest to lobby the French cause, Blair pens a congratulatory letter to Romanian leadership, thoughtfully drafted in the past tense, encouraging the sale to Mittal as if the contentious decision had already been finalized. In it, Blair falsely describes the Dutch-Antilles registered LNM as a “British company,” suggests that the purchase would facilitate Romania’s path to European Union membership, and, in an early draft, even dubs Mittal “a friend” (the warm sign-off was removed before Blair’s signing).
Blair’s decision to write the letter — supporting a bid by a private, non-UK-based company for no reason that seemed to benefit national interests — seems inexplicable (or, as the British press pointed out after the leak of the missive, much too explicable). But on July 25, five days after having left Bucharest empty-handed, Mittal flies back to the Romanian capital.
The deal and the Romanian steel plant are all his.
Mittal — who, like Blair, has denied any wrongdoing — continued to generously donate to Blair’s Labour for years, to the tune of millions of pounds, enough to become the party’s biggest benefactor. The relationship between the tycoon and the minister, publicized after the release of the letter, was controversial enough to inspire a scathing parliamentary motion with cross-party (including Labour) support, denouncing Mittal’s alleged labor abuses and prompting press releases from Mittal threatening to sue any media sources who hinted at impropriety.
The relationship was also profitable enough: Within years of leaving office, Blair had reinvented himself from an architect of the legally-contested invasion of Iraq into a peddler and PR representative for a variety of autocracies. Reporting by British tabloids suggested that Blair’s relationship with Mittal — chiefly a joint appearance at Kazakhstan’s capital, Astana, during a foreign investors’ council — might have helped him secure a multimillion-pound advising contract with the country’s autocratic regime.
The arrangement, which Blair has denied benefiting financially from, saw the former minister help draft speeches to ‘spin’ the 2011 massacre of 15 protestors and even featured him parroting talking points about the autocracy’s progress in a darkly funny propagandistic video.
***
The above alone makes for a Bond-villain-like story, a tale of suspected backroom deals so flagrant that the accused’s vehement denials become comical. But tug the thread ever so gently in any direction and Mittal’s web continues to unravel.
Blair wasn’t, after all, the only one who found lucrative opportunities in his ties to Kazakh despots. Mittal’s steel empire had long held a hefty stake in Kazakhstan’s industry, becoming, at one point, the country’s single biggest employer. Blair’s government had, for reasons of indiscernible legitimacy, approved millions’ worth of development loans to ArcelorMittal’s Kazakh investments, including a $3.4 million grant signed the same month as Mittal’s infamous $125,000 donation to the Labour Party, according to 2002 reporting by the Independent.
But you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs — and you seemingly can’t build a steel fortune without a few worker deaths.
Between 2004 and 2010, over a hundred workers died while working in Mittal’s Kazakh complexes, with accusations spanning back a decade that the company’s lackluster labor and safety standards actively endangered its workers. Despite falling injury rates over the past decade (by the company’s own count), labor-related deaths still haunt ArcelorMittal’s steel workers.
Last fall, after a string of worker fatalities, the Kazakh government opened the door to outright banning ArcelorMittal’s operations in the country, with individual legislators suggesting travel bans for top management. The country’s new president — who has pivoted away from the kid-gloves-treatment his predecessor afforded ArcelorMittal — has denounced the “systemic character” of the fatal incidents.
At one of the corporation’s facilities, where six workers perished in 2021, a government inspection reportedly found 200 health and safety violations that remained unremedied a year after the tragedy.
ArcelorMittal’s societal footprint goes well beyond labor practices. Steel production is a deeply polluting if necessary industry. For the 200,000 residents of Temirtau, a town home to a prominent ArcelorMittal facility responsible for 8 percent of the country’s emissions and with hydrogen sulfide levels sometimes 11-fold higher than governmental limits, that pollution is much too visible.
By the company’s own admission, absent sufficient wind, their pollutants may fail to dissipate. In 2018 Temirtau faced a disquietingly calm winter — and with it, its first pitch-black snowfall. Tinted flakes, soaked in concentrated pollutant particles, paved the town’s streets.
A billionaire’s late Christmas gift, if you wish.
Kazakhstan is but a data point, albeit a particularly egregious one, in Mittal’s questionable global track record. Every one of the trends above is replicated elsewhere.
Unconfirmed suggestions of sketchy backroom deals to acquire natural assets? Look towards Nigeria and Mittal’s outside-of-court settlement of allegations over unpaid finder’s fees. Worker deaths linked to safety standard violations? In the U.S., ArcelorMittal’s Indiana Harbor plant alone has been fined at least twice since 2017 for OSHA violations resulting in employee deaths; similar charges have been raised in South Africa and led to a half-a-million euro fine in Spain. Meaningful environmental concerns? Head towards ArcelorMittal’s Canadian mines, or read about the French town staging a revolt against the corporation and other polluters amid record cancer rates.
A global empire indeed.
***
Mittal strikes me, on paper, as the sort of character a novelist would never concoct: His fortune, secrecy, and blatantly questionable multinational dealings appear almost too obvious, too close to the maligned caricature of a rent-seeking member of the global elite.
And yet, for a donation worth less than a third of the reportedly $82 million budget for his niece’s Barcelona wedding (a presumably decadent affair, like all multimillion-dollar weddings, featuring a Michelin star cook and a 60-kilogram cake), hosts of Harvard alumni will graduate into positions of power linking Mittal’s name primarily to a philanthropic devotion to academia.
The Crimson’s own coverage failed to mention Mittal’s baggage when describing his million-dollar donation to Harvard — the worker deaths and coal-tinted snowflakes that undergird the wealth he so generously chose to share; I am yet, after almost two years of searching, to find a single comprehensive profile of the infamously guarded, Davos-attending man on any major newspaper profile.
But Mittal’s story is too good to not be told – even if briefly and haphazardly by an under-slept undergraduate with few resources. His name deserves to be linked, repeatedly, and on the public record, not just to Harvard advisory councils (a common side gig for our kindest donors) but to the oft-devastating trail of his steel empire.
Mittal’s isn’t the only narrative that deserves further scrutiny — nor is every such story concerned with a comically shady philanthropist. Harvard is a key power center at the core of an often cruel world order: Our affiliates have, for better or worse, occupied some of the most powerful positions on earth; researchers within our labs and classrooms continue to stand at the forefront of revolutionary global innovation. If journalism is to be understood as an account of the powers that be, an eye on the sort that attend Davos for those who never will, Harvard will always benefit from more reporting, from more attempts to analyze or nuance that which slipped our minds but shouldn’t have.
This column is about those stories. Over the next few months, I will dive into the Harvard tales, old and new, that never got the coverage or attention they deserved. I’ll be fishing for loose change, between the cracks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Space, as a concept, is religious in nature.
Space and architecture adhere to and reflect cosmic law. Grand architecture emphasizes the splendor of something unexplainable.
This manifests in two ways: the physical — the concrete-and-brick structures religion is housed within — and the non-physical — conversational crevices religion is permitted to fill. These contrasting spaces form a dialectic: Physical spaces guide our academic conversations and our spiritual sense of belonging; at the same time, we use that guidance to admire or demand changes to our spaces.
Harvard is peppered with religious spaces, and Harvard is fraught with the space of religious discourse.
My freshman year, I learned of the importance of space through its absence. During 2020 and 2021 — the Covid-19 years — Annenberg was a space we could not eat in, Widener a space we could not study in. Every space was defined by what we were not allowed to do in it. Trying to find your place, your space, within an entirely virtual campus only revealed the sacredness of that unassuming little word.
On Harvard’s campus, our understanding of space constructs and orients our way of life, often in radical and fascinating ways. The ideas we come into contact with and the habits we exercise are a product of the spaces we inhabit. Within Harvard’s walls, students assimilate, protest, and evolve.
Religious spaces are no different.
Courtney B. Lamberth, director of studies in the Committee on the Study of Religion at Harvard, said that “space for religious practice is foundational and fundamental.”
“How space is understood and utilized and held in practice varies tremendously across traditions,” she added.
Daryush D. Mehta, a representative of the Zoroastrian Association at Harvard, highlights the historical importance of space in his faith.
“Space is important,” he said. “I think back to how Zoroastrians in Iran and in Persia did not have buildings, but created the space with the pots and pans that they ate with.”
Space is also central to the Catholic faith. William T. Kelly, the pastor of St. Paul’s Parish in Cambridge, summarized the importance of space in Christian history, which shares emphases with Jewish, Greek, and Roman temples.
“There’s this sense of, ‘Where does the presence of God reside?’” Kelly questioned. “In the Catholic tradition, churches at the very, very beginning of the Church would have taken place in people’s homes,” he said. Those home churches were where God was present.
St. Paul’s Parish itself is a stunning space, its high ceilings, intricate stonework, and detailed altar reflecting the cosmic grandeur of the God it was built for.
“We know a lot of people historically, but also locally, who have become Catholic because of the beauty of Jesus, because of the beauty of the church here,” he added.
The senses — taste, smell, sound, sight, touch — play a vital role in bringing aspects of the faith to life, according to Kelly.
“We have a really strong sense of anything that’s tactile, anything visual,” he said.
Sahaj Singh ’23 reflected on the role of space within his faith, Sikhism.
“What I think is interesting about the Sikh religion center — which is known as a Gurdwara — is that it’s actually meant to be an interfaith center,” he said. “Essentially, its initial role in South Asia was to be a free clinic and free kitchen.”
Shruthi Kumar ’24, a believer of Hinduism, expressed her love for her religion’s temples.
“That physical space is usually one that’s very grandeur. It has a lot of space, has a lot of people coming through,” she said. “There’s a great pride that you take in changing the clothes of all the idols that are in the temple, adorning them with jewels, donating to the temple in order to keep it going.”
The space of the temple also provides a landscape for reflection — the tying of the physical with the non-physical — a space for mediation, according to Kumar.
Space reflects cultural values of the past while simultaneously influencing present dispositions. At Harvard, in the state where the Mayflower landed, we bring our former walks of life into dialogue with an environment that is historically Protestant.
Remnants of Harvard’s Christian past color the campus. A statue of Harvard’s namesake, John Harvard, a Puritan minister, sits squarely in the Yard. Memorial Hall is inscribed with the Latin words for “Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy name may there be glory.” Memorial Church is an interdenominational Protestant space, part of a larger interfaith network.
University Lutheran Church on Winthrop Street. Old Cambridge Baptist Church. First Parish in Cambridge. Inscribed on the side of Emerson Hall: “What is man that thou art mindful of him.”
Spatial residue of Protestantism evokes various reactions on Harvard’s campus.
“There are certainly plenty of churches around Harvard, just like any other town,” Shira Z. Hoffer ’25, a Jewish student, said. She’s a campus tour guide and when she gives tours, Memorial Church regularly sticks out.
“I always feel funny,” she said. “I think Memorial Church does amazing things. But it is kind of funny that we have a church right in the middle of our campus that plays a role in day-to-day life at Harvard.”
For Kumar, Memorial Church summons a sense of longing for something lost. Some Hindu practices, according to her, involve chanting prayers or mantras with a community, and she is worried she may forget some of her prayers because she doesn’t get the chance to practice them as regularly.
“When I walk through the Yard and see Memorial Church right there, it always brings up a feeling of, ‘I wish there was a Hindu temple within walking distance of campus,’” she said.
For many, Memorial Church and other spaces like it do not pose an inherent problem; rather, they are a reminder of space that does not exist.
Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein said “there could potentially be more space devoted to” religion on campus.
Mehta echoed Epstein’s sentiments as he reflected on trying to find spaces on campus for his own religious gatherings.
“Mem Church happened to have an opening,” he said. “I have no problem being in Mem Church… But a multifaith center would be very important at Harvard, as a message and physical presence.”
Those who have space cherish it. Those without space long for it. But for both, space is not the end all be all, but rather one instance of the feeling of belonging.
“In times when I feel like I need my community and to not be that minority,” said Hoffer, “I feel like Hillel is that fallback, which is really important and powerful.”
But people who are not fully represented in Harvard’s physical landscape, which spans Protestant structures, Harvard Hillel, and the Harvard Catholic Center, have to make religious spaces for themselves, whether expressly physical or not.
For Imaan Mirza ’25, placing the Muslim prayer space in Canaday basement means that prayer is a much more mobile practice for her.
“I was in Barker the other day for my History and Literature tutorial,” she said. “I just whipped out my prayer mat and prayed in front of people.”
Mirza is conflicted about this: On the one hand, she sees it as a beautiful thing, perhaps because Harvard has provided an environment where praying in many spaces feels comfortable, but on the other hand, it reminds her of what she does not have access to.
“Ideally, there would be a designated space in every Harvard affiliated building for me to pray. It’s too out of the way to go to Smith. It’s too out of the way to go to the basement of Canaday,” she said. “I’m driven by necessity to pray in front of people, which can be a little odd sometimes.”
When both Muslim and Hindu prayer spaces are hidden in Canaday’s basement, some students feel like religious inclusion is not prioritized at Harvard.
“I think the key to anything related to DEI is this feeling of belonging,” Kumar said. “And feeling is something that is very present in religion that we aren’t good at acknowledging in other spaces.”
For this reason, she said, religious diversity necessarily brings religious belonging into the conversation, which is something “any DEI initiative should include.”
Lamberth, the director of studies in the Committee on the Study of Religion, echoed this. “Religious diversity is the last aspect of diversity to really come into the discussion about inclusivity and diversity and belonging.”
Even within The Crimson, our Diversity and Inclusivity Committee does not focus on religious diversity relative to other facets of identity, like gender and sexuality or race and ethnicity.
An example of this greater need for religion to factor into conversations on diversity and inclusion is the use of the word “chaplain” to describe the various religious and faith leaders on campus.
The word choice of chaplain felt distant to Kumar. While she "intellectually" agreed with its definition, she did not personally relate to the vocabulary, nor did it inspire her to reach out to Harvard’s Hindu chaplain.
“It’s not something I’m going to naturally feel belonging towards,” she said.
Metha also reflected on the word: “The word chaplain is not used in Zoroastrianism. The concept is a little bit different.”
Though a single column is not nearly sufficient to tackle every aspect of religious space at Harvard, I hope to show the dialectic relationship between physical and intellectual space, both of which are tethered to the narratives of individuals on campus.
Physical space indicates what we institutionally value, which is then reproduced in the rhetoric we use and the initiatives we choose to emphasize. The institutional value Harvard places upon its Protestant heritage is evident: in Memorial Hall, in Memorial Church, in the placement of Hindu and Muslim spaces.
The spaces we hold — physical and non-physical — form, and potentially reform, each other. We must acknowledge the spaces that are already present, while also recognizing the absence of adequately representative space for some.
What space do you, and those around you, hold?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mississippi’s “Regulate Experimental Adolescent Procedures Act,” Alabama’s “Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act,” and Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” bill: Recent laws throughout the United States explicitly target transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people, questioning their existence and falsely accusing them of moral corruption and sexual abuse.
This hateful rhetoric spawns from sources spanning the religious to the medical, but it all contributes to institutionalized violence against the trans community. While much of the rhetoric is pushed by alt-right media, centrist and liberal media outlets have unfortunately not escaped the snare of bias either.
That seems to have been the case for the New York Times.
Last week, more than a thousand contributors and 23,000 supporters of the New York Times signed an open letter relaying concerns of editorial bias in the paper’s coverage of transgender, nonbinary and gender nonconforming people. The letter claimed that the New York Times’s coverage frames issues in a sensationalized way, uses charged language, and omits relevant information on sources.
We find merit in the concerns raised by the open letter.
One of the articles cited in the letter, for example, refers to one of the first trans youth to receive gender-affirming care as “Patient Zero.” The term — coined in reference to the first person to contract HIV/AIDS in the U.S. — pathologizes trans identity as a plague, providing a pernicious justification for the alarmist language that politicians wield today.
The same article also fails to disclose the affiliation of one key source as the president of an organization with self-professed “concerns and objections with gender care today,” dismissing practices of identifying potential sources of bias that are foundational to the integrity of the journalism.
The claims levied against the New York Times reflect a longer, decidedly troubled history of the esteemed paper’s coverage regarding LGBTQ+ communities. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, the New York Times was notably quiet, if not downright silent, only running a front-page article about the disease after the death toll from the virus had reached the thousands in the U.S., two whole years after its first symptoms were reported — a functional decade given the rapid nature of the news cycle. The paper’s official style manual even barred using “gay” as a synonym for homosexual until 1987.
As “a paper of record” in the eyes of its readers and political wielders, the New York Times has a responsibility to report ethically on communities that are, paradoxically, both marginalized and hypervisible. This requires careful consideration of the voices that are elevated in the “debate” around trans rights that really shouldn’t be a debate to begin with. As we have opined previously, it is prudent to distinguish between what speech is legally permissible and what ought to be platformed — especially when the stakes are as high as they are for historically marginalized communities.
While we believe that the New York Times never actively intended to produce any biased news coverage, we cannot ignore its impact. Multiple New York Times articles have been cited in court to legitimize and spur anti-trans legislation across the nation. Regardless of intent, the concerns in the letter have escalated to effects so monstrous that they must now be seriously contended with.
Journalistic objectivity does not amount to a get-out-of-jail free card. When newspapers receive criticism on their coverage of issues surrounding certain communities — and particularly when that criticism comes from within — they cannot hide, and definitely not behind structures they themselves devised.
We find the response from the New York Times executives deeply concerning, with their subtly-threatening condemnation of staff participation in criticisms around trans coverage. As leaders in the journalistic community, these executives should be especially aware of the role they play in presenting coverage, shaping perceptions, and influencing policies at the newspaper. With that power comes the responsibility to take the perspectives of their contributors seriously, rather than dismiss legitimate observations on a systematic sensitive coverage blindspot as undesirable “advocacy.”
We wish that the New York Times would share the criticisms levied by the open letter within the paper itself, in the format of letters to the editor common to newspapers from ourselves at The Crimson to the Times itself. Furthermore, this situation painfully illustrates the necessity of bolstering Diversity and Inclusion initiatives within all newspapers, in order to pre-empt poor coverage decisions and editorial judgment on pieces affecting marginalized communities.
As times change, so should the Times. Along with past conventions of coverage, continual self-critique is an essential part of journalism; refusing to seriously and openly contend with valid, if uncomfortable, observations about coverage belies an assumption of infallibility that cheapens our collective pursuit of the truth.
To the many current New York Times contributors who once stood in our Crimson-tinted shoes, we urge our former fellow student journalists to consider again the practices that have always guided our work, from the halls of 14 Plympton Street all the way to your paper of record.

Manja Klemenčič is an associate senior lecturer in Sociology and researcher on higher education, student agency, and student-centered learning.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: You grew up on a small farm in Slovenia — far different than the bustling city you live in today. What was your experience growing up in such a rural area like?
MK: I am known for the saying that ‘You can take the girl out of the village, but you cannot take the village out of the girl,’ and I am still a very avid gardener, with a very small but very heavily cultivated urban garden — edible, mostly edible, not very many decorative plants in our garden. So that was part of my childhood.
It was of course in the country which was under the totalitarian regime with everything that that implies — indoctrination in schools, self-censorship. It was not a very oppressive regime so people were not necessarily jailed, but everyone was cautious about what was said, especially in the public space and in the context of the schooling.
So I’m very sensitive to any illiberal democratic practices, and I’m very sensitive to any attempts of indoctrinating, especially in the context of education or higher education. I resent it, because it stifles intellectual discovery.
FM: You’re going back to Slovenia this year for your research during your sabbatical. What do you think are the main differences between the higher education system there in Slovenia and in the US?
MK: First, we don’t have liberal arts and sciences colleges. Students in high school choose, already, their discipline.
So, choices have to be made much sooner than they are in the context of liberal arts and sciences education. And of course, if something is lost when you do not have a chance to explore interdisciplinarily like we do in the context of higher education.
FM: Is there anything in particular you’re looking forward to during your sabbatical other than your research?
MK: I will be spending time with my parents on the farm. So I’m looking forward to going back to the basics and to conduct research and to write in the context of being in nature and being back to the village and bridging those both worlds.
FM: Your Gen Ed and Sociology courses have consistently been met with positive student feedback, and you have been awarded for excellent teaching in the past. In your opinion, what makes a good teacher? 
MK: I don’t presume I have all the answers. I am a very big believer that students learn as well from each other, and that I learn from them as well, and that my role is really to nurture that interest, that curiosity, and support them so they, too, can generate knowledge as part of my courses.
Now, in this Gen Ed, I have 100 people.
I am spending this month meeting with each one of them in order to help them find a topic that they find interesting that they will be spending time writing their three essays on.
I cannot teach nameless students. That’s why I make the effort to try to meet each of them or get to know each of them as much as I can.
I insist on one meeting with me, even with 100. Just that we have one personal connection, because things change if we have spoken. They really change in the sense of even how people react later in the classroom, how empowered they feel in the classroom to participate, and also the way that they are motivated to work on the topic that they have chosen for their essays.
FM: How long have you known you’ve wanted to teach?
MK: It came quite natural to me. I did not know I would want to go into the teaching profession, probably until university, when that kind of calling for being a TF or undergraduate teaching assistant was offered to me.
It became a major part of my academic identity. I did continue research, but teaching became what I have found my pathway and when I found my calling.
FM: What makes you interested in studying higher education in particular or teaching higher education in particular, in comparison to elementary and secondary school studies?
MK: I’m a specialist in higher education because while I was a student myself, I had very poor education experience.
I spent a year in a liberal arts and sciences college in the U.S. my junior year, which has completely changed my perspective of what higher education should be about, how quality education can look like that there can actually be meaningful learning rather than just memorization, rote learning.
FM: Historically, research on education has focused on adult experiences of the student-teacher relationship, neglecting the student’s role in the classroom. Do you think the field is moving toward more student-focused research? 
MK: Definitely yes, for a number of reasons. I think the progressive pedagogies are taking ground in K-12, as well as in higher education, which are putting the students in the center of the educational enterprise and are highlighting that students are not just passive recipients of knowledge, but that they they have agency, and they have responsibility, and they can co-construct the knowledge within the context of the classroom.
It is our role as teachers and as education institutions to really help them become those agentic individuals. Because at the end of the day, it is agentic individuals that help our scientists as informed critical citizens, it is agentic individuals that are important for the market economies and the productivity of the economic sectors by being inventive, and it’s also agentic individuals that drive cultural expression.
So we have to foster this agency in students already in higher education contexts, and that doesn’t happen if we are just lecturing at them, without involving them, and valuing them.
FM: At universities across the country, there has been a growing push for students to focus on pre-professional studies or choose concentrations that align well with post-grad careers. Do you think this is a positive or negative shift in higher education? 
MK: It’s so difficult; I don’t think we should be judging students of making choices one way or another. Because we never know what is that student’s background and where they’re coming from and whether what they have to do is they have to find a way of earning the money that they will be supporting themselves and their extended family that rely on their income in order to be able to live decently.
I respect when people have a need to have financial security and not depend on others, and that’s a legitimate reason for me for seeking a well-paying job. And that does not mean that this student has abandoned doing good or having social impact.
FM: What do you think is the most pressing issue facing higher ed at the moment?
MK: Where should I start?
Student debt associated with the rises in the prices of higher education is widely considered one of the key issues in higher education in the United States, specifically. Because it’s also tied to the question that many are posing, is higher education worth it? Is it worth the cost? Is it worth going or do there exist credible alternatives to higher education that will become more accepted by the employers? Alternative forms of gaining credentials for different types of jobs?
Access to quality higher education is a global concern and has been always very high on the priority of the student unions, especially with the rising prices of higher education.
Post-Covid, mental health crisis is something that has been mentioned also outside the United States, the European context. It’s something that’s being discussed among student leaders globally, and has not been properly and fully addressed yet.
FM: In your letter to students in the Harvard Gazette, you write, “Your everyday activities in your campus job or in student groups, as small as they seem, are an indispensable part of Harvard.” Why do you think these activities, which often come secondary to students’ academics, should be prioritized? 
MK: Often when people come to a place like Harvard, and they’re accepted in such a small number to such a selective institution, they have very high demands on themselves on what they expect for themselves to do and be and to achieve.
I was just hoping with that message, to tell students not to worry that much. That small things matter, just the same things that they do every day — small acts of kindness, a service to other students in some way — that they actually make a difference. You don’t need to change the entire world already while you’re at Harvard. You can do small things every day and that matters also.
When scholars research student workers or when they research even student leadership, student groups on campus, they often focus on how this work impacts the student. They would portray student work as a way of alternative tuition assistance and professional networking opportunities or CV building, and skills development.
They disregard the fact that students in those roles actually have an impact on others as well, that they’re doing meaningful work.
Students have immense contributions that they make daily to the lives of others.
FM: Last semester, I was a barista at one of the cafes, now I’m a bartender at the pub. It’s just fun and ends up being what I look forward to.
MK: You choose the spaces where you want to be in that role and what you want to do and it has to be recognizing this is for you. But it is as well, you can make somebody’s day a little bit nicer by interacting with that person who comes to your space as a barista, connecting with them human to human. It makes a difference.
FM: In your Gen Ed, you probe the controversies of higher ed institutions, including Harvard, asking students to analyze the ways that Harvard might stray from its values. Have any ideas about ways to structurally change areas of the university continually come up amongst students across the years?
MK: The topics in my courses are as diverse as there are Harvard students with a variety of interests. So it would be difficult for me to really see some common topics that have been persistent and unresolved. Usually what would happen is students take them, that they discussed in the course, and somebody addresses them down the line, like Andrew Pérez and James Bedford did when they were part of the team establishing FYRE as the pre-orientation program for first year students.
FM: How do you aim to create an environment for your classes that makes students feel comfortable to challenge each other in debates, especially in the midst of growing cancel culture tendencies within the classroom? 
MK: We as a class have established a number of norms by which we abide in order to be able to encourage and support constructive disagreement in the classroom.
The first one is that we try to see constructive disagreement as an act of care for each other’s individual and our collective learning. It’s not about winning an argument or hitting another person down by winning the point in that argument. It is really about trying to unravel the variety of the arguments and evidence to support those arguments on very complex issues that divide our societies.
And we have the norm that nothing that is said in class goes outside the class, necessarily. Everything stays in; we do not quote anyone on what they have said in class outside without their explicit permission.
And especially, I don’t disclose my positions on any of those issues because I am still a teacher and in a position of authority and I do not want to indoctrinate. I want people to teach and be willing to discuss issues from all possible perspectives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost two hundred students learned their housing fates last week with the release of this year’s first round of decisions for fall interhouse transfer applications.
Students may apply to transfer houses after living in their initially assigned house for two semesters, with two rounds of transfer applications available for the fall semester. One hundred and eighty-five students applied to transfer houses for the fall 2023 semester, according to Dean of Students Office spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman.
Goldman did not reply to multiple requests regarding the number of students whose applications were successful.
Brent J. Smith ’25, whose application to transfer from Quincy House to Pforzheimer House with his roommate was approved, said his decision to transfer to the Radcliffe Quadrangle — where Pforzheimer is located — “is definitely unpopular.”
“Every time I tell someone that I transferred from Quincy to the Quad, I get the same reaction, which is like, ‘Oh my gosh, why would you do that?’ — which I get,” Smith said.
“I’ve spent almost every day there anyways because that’s where all my friends are, and I love it there,” he added, referring to the Quad.
Other students attempted to transfer out of the Quad to one of the nine river houses.
Elyse G. Martin-Smith ’25, whose application to move from Pforzheimer to Winthrop House was successful, said she “ranked pretty much every River House” when applying.
“For me to travel with my large tenor saxophone every time I wanted to play music with ensembles was really challenging for me,” she added.
Martin-Smith, who moved from Pfoho’s main building to overflow housing in Cronkhite Center on Brattle St. at the start of this semester, said the shorter commute from Cronkhite suited her better
“Housing has a big impact on how things go for you,” she said. “Moving from Pfoho to Cronkhite has been really great for my mental health.”
For Esha Ahmad ’25 and Crimson editorial editor Labiba Uddin ’25 — both of whom will be moving into Winthrop next year from Pfoho — the “stigma” surrounding the Quad influenced the choice to attempt to transfer.
“I think there’s just too much stigma,” Ahmad said. “I think this is such a deeper-rooted issue.”
“It’s such a Harvard thing,” Ahmad added.
Despite the amenities of Pfoho, Uddin and Ahmad said they did not feel there was much tethering them to the house. The two said they did not apply to transfer together, but both were reassigned to Winthrop.
“The amenities are great; the events are really wonderful, but also the Pfoho faculty deans are leaving, so there wasn’t too much tying us down there,” Uddin said.
Some students also said the transfer process was unclear at times, with little outside assistance.
Cole M. Breen ’25, who unsuccessfully attempted to transfer out of Currier House, said the process was “certainly pretty opaque.”
“The form itself is just a couple boxes,” he said. “Maybe there would have been more help if we sought some, but from what I’ve heard the whole process itself is pretty non-transparent.”
Uddin said the first round of the fall interhouse transfer process felt “random” and should consider an applicant’s reasons for wanting to transfer.
“I just feel that the housing system is so, so random that sometimes there are things that I feel should be taken into consideration other than the accommodations that are made right now,” she said.
Goldman did not respond to a request for comment on the application process.
Kieran J. Farrell ’25 said he was surprised to receive his fourth option, Lowell House. Farrell said he and his roommate assumed that Lowell would be particularly popular, so they ranked it below houses they felt would have more space for transfers.
“I thought it was just super weird that it was even possible,” said Farrell, a Crimson arts editor.
Students may apply to transfer either individually or with one other person — a requirement that can split blocking groups like Breen’s if multiple group members are seeking to transfer.
“Looking forward to that next round,” Breen said. “Hoping I can reunite with the block in Lowell.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Pride for the People will be hosting the first Boston Pride parade and festival since 2019 this June, bringing back the event after the previous group — the Boston Pride Committee — dissolved and left the city without a parade in 2022.
In June 2020, the Boston Pride Committee — which had organized Boston’s annual Pride parade since 1999 — became embroiled in controversy after removing references to the Black Lives Matter movement in an amended press statement following the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.
Protesting the decision, more than 80 percent of the organization’s volunteers resigned and created their own organizations, including Boston Black Pride, Trans Resistance, and Pride 4 The People, which was later rebranded as Boston Pride for the People.
In December 2020, many of these newly created LGBTQ+ organizations called for a boycott of the 2021 Boston Pride parade, which was ultimately canceled due to a surge in Covid-19 cases.
Following the boycott, the Boston Pride Committee dissolved in July 2021, leaving the city without a Pride parade for another year — though some gathered in Boston Common to celebrate with a “Pop-Up Pride” in its place in June 2022.
Now, a new organization, Boston Pride for the People, has picked up the task of organizing the event that attracted 750,000 people in 2019 — greater than the entire population of the city proper.
Adrianna M. Boulin and Jo Trigilio, president and vice president, respectively, of Boston Pride for the People, discussed plans for the event in a joint interview. The group’s primary aim is to have the event be “community-centered and as inclusive as possible,” Trigilio said.
Trigilio added the event’s organizers want “to be very intentional about racial equity, racial inclusion, trans inclusion, inclusion of people with disabilities.”
Boulin said last year’s Pop-Up Pride inspired the organization’s vision of a Pride focused on inclusivity and unity.
“I remember when Pop-Up Pride was held over the summer, it felt so good,” Boulin said. “It felt grassroots; it felt right. It felt like we were beginning to fill the void.”
The two also addressed more substantive policy decisions about how they will hold the Boston Pride Parade this year — referencing issues that have caused controversy among Pride organizers across the United States.
On one such issue — the presence of police officers — Trigilio said the pair spoke with Boston Police about holding a Pride where “people feel safe in the space” and confirmed that officers would be at the event, citing threats against LGBTQ+ people in Boston as an ongoing safety concern.
Trigilio said the group’s goal, however, is to “find ways of having people feel safe without having a really heavy police presence,” adding that the group plans to release more details at a later date.
Another issue the pair said they want to address is the involvement of private corporations in Pride, which some LGBTQ+ groups across the U.S. have criticized as unethical. Critics say that corporations benefit from the visibility and perceived allyship of marching in the Parade while still maintaining internal policies, work conditions, or political donations contrary to LGBTQ+ interests.
Some alternative Pride events and organizations like the Trans Resistance March — which began in response to the controversy around the Boston Pride Committee — have explicitly rejected corporate funding and participation as part of their events.
Meagan von Rohr, the assistant director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life at Harvard College, said this issue is particularly relevant to Boston.
“Boston Pride before 2020 had a particular reputation for having a large corporate presence and being white,” von Rohr said.
Boulin said the group wants to ensure any corporations involved with the event share their same values.
“We’re vetting our corporations that are involved,” Boulin added.
When asked to specify details of the vetting process, Trigilio said the organization was “still formulating” its plan, but that they were “definitely going to have something we can share soon.”
Megan E.C. Gianniny, co-chair of Harvard’s LGBTQ Staff and Faculty Employee Resource Group, lauded Boston Pride for the People for its messaging so far.
“They’re very focused on the community,” Gianniny said. “And not just corporations that want to give rainbow-washing money.”
“We’re definitely planning to try and have a Harvard contingent in the parade,” Gianniny added.
Von Rohr said she is similarly optimistic for what’s to come.
“I’m really excited for Boston Pride to come back in this way, especially in a way that welcomes every intersecting identity,” Von Rohr said.
Looking forward, Trigilio said they hope Pride “keeps evolving,” in the same way their organization is changing the look of Boston Pride now.
“I hope that Pride through the years is listening to what the community needs because community needs keep changing,” Trigilio said. “As we listen to community needs, we’re responsive and we continue changing and evolving.”

More than 20 Harvard students gathered on the steps of Memorial Church Thursday evening to mourn lives lost to gun violence this year, including three college students recently killed in a Feb. 13 shooting at Michigan State University.
Seven student speakers braved the falling snow to share anecdotes, words of hope, and an original song at the event hosted by Amnesty at Harvard.
Event co-organizer Kawsar Yasin ’26 said she is troubled by the frequency of gun violence she has seen growing up, particularly against people of color.
“I didn’t realize how desensitized I’d become to this until it started to happen at least twice, three times, four times every year from middle school all the way up until high school,” she said.
Referencing previous mass school shootings in Parkland, Florida, and El Paso, Texas, Kashish Bastola ’26 said young people have been “galvanized” by the “countless shootings that we have continuously endured every year.”
“I think that having vigils like these and spaces for us to come together, hear each other, and understand the ways that this epidemic and this public health crisis is impacting all of us is really important because this is not normal,” he said.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, who also helped organize the vigil, said the recent string of mass shootings across the country motivated her to create a dedicated campus space for students to mourn.
“So many of our communities have been affected in so many different ways,” Ahuja said, referring to the shootings. “To see it happen in Monterey, Half Moon, Michigan State, there hasn’t been a space for collective healing on our campus in the way that there really should be.”
The event was co-sponsored by an array of Harvard student organizations, from political organizations to campus affinity groups. Yasin said she was heartened by the broad coalition.
“I think it was really powerful to have a bunch of campus affinity groups, ranging from the Asian American Association, to Harvard Sikhs, to GAASA, as well as the queer organizations here,” she said. “I think that this kind of solidarity is not typically seen in the context of gun violence here.”
Ahuja also praised attendees for enduring below-freezing temperatures to turn out to the hour-long event.
“As chilly as it is, we thought it was important to still hold the space,” Ahuja said. “We just have a lot of love for everyone that came and showed their support and solidarity.”

Throughout February, Harvard students are commemorating Black History Month with celebrations put on by undergraduate houses and affinity groups.
Black History Month annually recognizes the accomplishments of Black Americans and their role in United States history. The celebration was initiated by historian Carter G. Woodson, who completed his Ph.D. at Harvard in 1912, and has been recognized by every U.S. president since 1976.
Pforzheimer House resident Elyse G. Martin-Smith ’25 said her house “really stepped up” for the month. Martin-Smith participated in a Black women’s self-care night and an African diaspora listening party organized by the House’s race relations tutors.
Martin-Smith, a member of the Harvard Black Students Association, said she appreciated the opportunity to discuss Black identity with her peers in a residential space without having to plan the events.
“I do a lot of planning myself, and to have that burden taken off me for just a minute — and having tutors or deans step up and take that event planning into their own hands — meant a lot,” she said.
The celebrations continued at other houses. At Quincy House, residents visited Frugal Bookstore, a Black-owned bookstore, to purchase books for the House’s Junior Common Room. The house also hosted a walking tour of the Black Heritage Trail, which ends at the Museum of African American History in Boston.
Quincy resident B. Ashton Alexander ’23 attended a screening of the documentary “Soul Food Junkies,” catered by Black-owned soul food restaurant Coast Cafe.
“It was an opportunity for members of the house to come together as a collective and as a community, and anytime you can do that over good food, it just seems like a win-win,” he said.
All house dining halls also commemorated Black History Month on Thursday with menus that took inspiration from influential Black chefs, according to Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin.
Winthrop House also offered an “African Heritage Diet” cooking class last Friday, Martin added.
Outside of the houses, campus affinity groups for Black students held events to celebrate.
On Saturday, BSA hosted their sixth annual Black Legacy Ball, which celebrated “Black Culture and the achievements of Black people at the College and beyond,” according to the group’s website.
Michael O. Omole ’24, BSA vice president, took the lead in planning the event, which he described as “a celebration of Black Harvard.”
The ball honors two faculty members and a high school student each year. This year’s honorees were Cambridge Rindge and Latin School senior and incoming Harvard student Helen Hailemariam; Harvard Gullah language instructor Sunn m’Cheaux; and Theater, Dance, and Media lecturer Shamell Bell — an original member of the Black Lives Matter movement.
BSA’s other upcoming events include a Diversity Career Expo, the Black Boston Bash — a party with other Boston-area universities — and a Black History Month mixer.
BSA President Rothsaida Sylvaince ’24 said Black History Month is a time to “celebrate both the history and the future” of Black Americans.
“With events like the Black Legacy Ball — but also some of the other events that we’ve had this month — it was an opportunity for us to really get a chance to highlight what work has been done historically and also think about ways for us to move forward as a community,” Sylvaince said.
The Harvard Black Men’s Forum sent out a trivia question each day of the month featuring figures in Black history. BMF Secretary Christopher D. Wright ’25 said the group also partnered with other Black organizations and the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations to put on a trivia event called Hella Black Trivia.
“We really want to expose people to these untold figures and untold narratives and get people to research more about Black history,” Wright said. “Oftentimes, Black history is not told alongside American history or world history.”
The Generational African American Students Association organized events including a cross-cultural discussion called “Uncovering our Black Histories” with the Harvard African Students Association, a Black poetry workshop and discussion with the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, and the inaugural Mardi Gras Mixer on Monday with Daylan Davis, Miss Black Massachusetts 2023.
Jaivyance G. “Jai” Gillard ’25, GAASA’s social chair, described the Mardi Gras Mixer as a “heartwarming” time to “be in community and fellowship with one another.”
“Celebrating Black History Month to us means recognition,” GAASA President Jordan K. Young ’25 said. “At the end of day, what we’re trying to do is create a space where we can celebrate Blackness.”
GAASA Events Chair Aimee R. Howard ’25 said Black History Month grew out of a “call for visibility” among generational African Americans.
“A lot of our celebration has been just that: a recognition of our past, but also celebrating how far we’ve come through joy,” she added.
Gillard said that, despite the designation of February as Black History Month, the celebrations will continue.
“As generational African American students, we live this story — we live Black History Month — every day,” she said.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned China against providing military aid to Russia during a virtual appearance at a Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center event on Wednesday.
Kuleba said a Beijing move to supply Russia with weapons and ammunition to support its war against Ukraine would be a “major blow” to China’s own principle of territorial integrity.
“China is a big and important player. We have to be careful,” Kuleba said. “But we made our choice: We will fight until we prevail, whatever happens, and whoever tries to support Russia in this struggle.”
“So let’s see how it goes, but we will remain in close contact with both Chinese colleagues and American friends,” Kuleba added.
The event, hosted by the Future of Diplomacy Project and HKS’ Ukraine Caucus, was held two days before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — a massive escalation in a war between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists that dates back to 2014. Kuleba’s remarks also came days after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken ’84 said China is considering providing lethal support for Russia to use in Ukraine.
“We’ve made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship,” said Blinken, a former Crimson editor, during a Saturday interview with CBS News.
Kuleba addressed the audience from New York where he was attending an emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly. He opened the event by outlining recent Ukrainian history, including the removal of nuclear weapons from the country after the fall of the Soviet Union, which Kuleba called part of a “chain of mistakes” that led to the current war.
“Instead of cementing Ukraine’s place in the West, our state was disarmed and abandoned in the gray zone to see what would come out of it,” Kuleba said. “The Cold War was over but Ukraine was left outside in the cold.”
Kuleba also emphasized the United States’ role in guaranteeing European security since the end of World War II.
“For years, Europe had been confident enough to say it could sort things out without America, but this war has proven the opposite, whether you like it or not,” he said. “The United States continues to bear a responsibility for maintaining European peace since 1945.”
During the event, Kuleba discussed his recent meeting at the Munich Security Conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Josep Borrell, the European Union foreign policy chief — the first high-level talks held between Ukraine, NATO, and the EU.
Kuleba said the meeting “went extremely well” and was “related to the production, procurement of weapons, and ammunition for Ukraine — and most importantly, deliveries.”
“This rapprochement between Ukraine and NATO and EU — it should have happened years ago,” Kuleba added. “But there was always a lack of political will, mostly on the side of both alliances or institutions, to make it happen.”
Now, Kuleba said, the will is there.
“I do not think that integration into EU and NATO remain the biggest problems of Ukrainian foreign policy because this is going to happen,” he said. “There is no way back. Wheels of history are turning.”
“It’s just a matter of time,” Kuleba added. “And the sooner it happens, the better it will be for all of us.”

A courthouse in Merced, California, will now bear the name of Harvard Law School emeritus professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr. following a ceremony hosted by the Superior Court of California, County of Merced, Feb. 17.
The renaming ceremony recognized Ogletree, a Merced native, for his contributions to civil rights and legal education.
California Governor Gavin Newsom signed California Assembly Bill 2268 on Sept. 18, 2022, which officially renamed the courthouse. In collaboration with the NAACP, former California assemblymember Adam C. Gray introduced the bill one year ago.
After graduating from HLS in 1978, Ogletree embarked on his career as a public defender in Washington, eventually becoming deputy director of the District of Columbia Public Defender Service. He later established a private practice, during which he represented law professor Anita Hill when she accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.
He returned to the Law School as a professor in 1985, where he founded both the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice and the Criminal Justice Institute. Ogletree, who taught and mentored former President Barack Obama, was previously honored by the Law School in October 2017 with a professorship endowed in his name.
Members of Ogletree’s family, prominent Merced legal and political figures, and local academics — including University of California Merced Chancellor Juan Sánchez Muñoz — attended the naming ceremony.
“He can receive all kinds of national and international recognition, but for him to be recognized by our hometown, it’s special. It’s just special,” the professor’s brother Richard Ogletree said at the event, according to the Fresno Bee.
The event also featured a recorded video message from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).
“Throughout his life and throughout his legal journey, Professor Ogletree has been an incredible force of nature, a dynamic public servant who has advanced the law for social justice, civil rights, civil liberties and tolerance in our society like none other,” Jeffries said.
Ogletree, who retired in 2020 after a 2016 Alzheimer’s diagnosis, was not in attendance at the event.
His former client, Hill, sent a message to the Ogletree family after the courthouse’s christening, according to the Merced County Times.
“As this naming ceremony takes place during Black History Month, we are reminded that, for generations to come, the courthouse should and must always be a place where fairness and equal justice prevail,” Hill said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Education experts and authors discussed the experiences of students of color in public schools and possibilities for education reform in a Harvard Education Press webinar Thursday.
The event was held in commemoration of Black History Month and featured four panelists who specialize in topics regarding the inclusion of Black and Latinx students in American public schools. Thursday’s panel was moderated by Jessica T. Fiorillo, the executive director of Harvard Education Press.
Panelist Lawrence “Torry” Winn — an associate professor of education at the University of California Davis School of Education — said the experience of students of color in public schools today is not noticeably different from those of the past.
“Students of color, especially African American or Black students, are not treated today any better than yesterday,” Winn said.
Racial discrimination in schools affects all students of color, even individuals often overlooked as “high-achieving,” according to Terah T. Venzant Chambers, a professor at the Michigan State University College of Education.
“I want to disrupt the notion that when it comes to these Black and Latinx students who are doing well in school, taking AP classes, earning top grades, that everything is fine. That is not necessarily true,” Venzant Chambers said.
“When we peel back the layer, we understand that these students are operating within a very complex system that gives rigid messages about what is right with respect to how they should behave, or speak, or dress if they want to be seen as smart,” Venzant Chambers added.
Jeffrey M.R. Duncan-Andrade, an ethnic studies professor at San Francisco State University, said radical education reform is needed in order to achieve educational equity.
“If we are honest about the data, we know that what needs to happen is not a soft pivot,” Duncan-Andrade said. “It’s a foundational, fundamental rethink about the very purpose of public schools in this society.”
Sufficient acknowledgement of the need for reform is missing from the broader public conversation around education, replaced by a “false innocence” and disbelief at injustice in the classroom, according to Duncan-Andrade.
“That’s just the stuff that made it into the headlines,” he said. “Until we get to the place where white folks and people in power are as angry and disillusioned as Black and Indigenous and poor people have been from the outset of this public school project in this nation, then we’ll continue to have to lift up things that folks of color know are happening to us every single day.”
Panelist Nicole M. Joseph, an associate professor of math education at Vanderbilt University, said she wanted to recognize the perseverance of public school teachers who make efforts to uplift students of color.
“I do want to elevate teachers that are resisting, that are creating curricular experiences that are helping Black and Latinx students to understand that they’re strong, that they can learn, that they are highly intellectual and intelligent,” Joseph said. “Those teachers need to be celebrated, elevated, paid more.”
Duncan-Andrade said he looks to the future of education with optimism.
“This nation has a real allergy to truth-telling,” he said. “What I really appreciate about young people is the ways in which they show a courage that I often find absent in grown folks, which is a willingness to just tell the damn truth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Jessica Stern discussed America’s leadership in global LGBTQ+ rights at a Wednesday Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum.
The event was moderated by Timothy P. “Tim” McCarthy ’93, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who focuses on education leadership. During the forum, Stern and McCarthy discussed U.S. diplomacy and advocacy around addressing human rights crises around LGBTQ+ rights.
Stern said discrimination persists despite improvements in global LGBTQ+ rights, creating a landscape she described as a “moment of polarization.”
“We have certain priorities fighting decriminalization around the world, lifting up the vulnerability of LGBTQI asylum seekers and refugees, increasing foreign assistance of LGBTQI rights, and being a leader in global coalitions to help make this work easier around the world,” she said.
Still, Stern said her work has not been free of criticism.
McCarthy said some have alleged Stern’s office is “imposing a vision or a view of human rights that’s very much American or western.” Stern acknowledged western legacies of colonialism and said her work focuses on collaborating with LGBTQ+ people “at the community level.”
McCarthy said another criticism Stern has faced is that her work is “imposing or importing homosexuality.”
“LGBTQI people are in every country of the world, in every family or in every neighborhood,” Stern said, in her response.
Stern added it is important to proceed with “humility” when working to further LGBTQ+ rights as a U.S. government official.
“I’m not pretending that we have all the answers for LGBTQI rights, and I think that’s really important,” she said.
Changes in the U.S. presidential administration can impact the work of the government around advancing LGBTQ+ rights, according to Stern.
Discussing the volatility of Stern’s role, McCarthy noted that the “position was created by President Obama and then left vacant during the Trump Administration, and now it’s back.”
“The institution has to reckon with what it means to not always have a stable North Star,” Stern said of her office.
Stern emphasized the importance of depoliticizing discussions around LGBTQ+ rights within the U.S. and globally.
“We act with an eye on the question of, ‘How do we institutionalize and depoliticize this agenda?’” Stern said.
Stern also discussed the importance of decriminalizing LGBTQ+ status around the world, noting that there are 66 countries with a form of sodomy law. Still, she added, there has been progress: Four countries have decriminalized sodomy this year.
Stern condemned conversion therapy, describing it as “incomprehensible.”
“It’s a set of practices that ranges from torture to starvation to electroshock therapy that seeks to change someone’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression or sex characteristics,” she said. “This can’t be okay for any of us.”
Stern also discussed the interplay between LGBTQ+ rights and national security, economic development, climate change, and refugee crises.
“There’s really not an issue you can think of where there’s not an LGBTQI angle,” she said.
Stern closed her talk by reflecting on her personal experience as an LGBTQ+ person, saying the “government hasn’t always defended our rights.”
“We’re more often on the streets asking governments to recognize us — but people are policy, so we also need people who are inside the institution,” she said. “We need people in the streets, we need people who negotiate with governments, and we need people who are in government. We need all of it.”

Sewell Chan ’98, editor-in-chief of the Texas Tribune, was elected to serve as this year’s chief marshal for the Class of 1998, according to a Feb. 16 press release.
A tradition that dates back to 1899, the chief marshal of alumni is nominated based on the success of their career and contributions to Harvard and society at large. Once elected, the chief marshal leads the 25th reunion celebration and represents all University alumni at Harvard Alumni Day on June 2.
Many notable alumni have served as chief marshals, including former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904; former Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91; and Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey ’92.
This summer, Chan will lead the alumni parade and join University and alumni leaders in a luncheon at Widener Library.
“I felt very humbled, very appreciative, and very surprised to get this honor,” Chan said.
Prior to leading the Texas Tribune, Chan worked as an editor at the Los Angeles Times. He also reported for the Washington Post and the New York Times earlier in his career.
Chan currently serves on the boards of the Pulitzer Prize, Freedom House, and the Columbia Journalism Review, among numerous other organizations.
Harvard Alumni Association President Allyson Mendenhall ’90 praised Chan’s dedication to “advocating for the power of journalism” and mentoring aspiring journalists in a press release.
“Like the countless Harvard alumni whose impact we see all around us, Sewell has also given back to his profession — as mentor and leader in advancing access of news media to diverse communities,” she added.
Chan has been an active member of the Harvard alumni network. He served on the board of incorporators at Harvard Magazine for more than 15 years and was elected to its board of directors in 2022.
As an undergraduate, Chan was a Crimson editor, covering notable events ranging from the Dunster House murder suicide, the rescindment of a student’s acceptance to the College for the murder of her mother, and food poisoning in the freshman dining hall.
“I learned at The Crimson to be very fast and efficient as a reporter, to collaborate with people, and learn from others — and just to be part of a really exciting journalism community,” Chan said.
Chan said he is excited to see his classmates and other Harvard affiliates at this year’s reunion.
“I’m really glad to serve as a host — someone to welcome all the alumni, someone to be a welcoming face for all my classmates — and to help facilitate good conversations around life and around where we are in life, where our society is, what are our hopes and dreams for ourselves and for our children,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 380 researchers signed a Feb. 8 letter asking the National Institutes of Health to stop funding nonhuman primate experiments at Harvard Medical School.
The letter opposes research with macaque monkeys conducted by HMS professor Margaret S. Livingstone. The authors — members of Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Clinic and the University of St Andrews’ Wild Minds Lab — encouraged the NIH to revoke funding for nonhuman primate research that lacked “ecological validity” and involved “cruel and unnecessary treatment of laboratory animals.”
In an article published by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Sept. 19, 2022, Livingstone reported that postpartum female monkeys form strong and persistent attachments to inanimate surrogate infants through touch.
Livingstone first observed this phenomenon when one of the monkeys in her lab, named Monkey Ve, delivered a stillborn infant. When the infant was removed, the mother became distressed. Livingstone placed a stuffed animal in her enclosure, and upon picking the toy up, the monkey became calm. The monkey continued to hold the stuffed animal for a week.
In addition, Livingstone observed the phenomenon in three of five other mothers whose infant monkeys she removed the day they were born.
Referring to Livingstone’s experiments with maternal attachment in postpartum macaque monkeys, the February letter said her work “has not and, we suggest, cannot add any meaningful contribution to our knowledge of either non-human or human primate behavior.”
“Science already has a deep understanding of the mother-infant primate bond from decades of work,” the letter stated. “We see the same patterns of behavioral and physiological impact in observations of wild primates.”
The letter comes after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals circulated a petition on Oct. 12, 2022, asking University President Lawrence S. Bacow and HMS to close Livingstone’s lab. According to PETA’s website, the petition now has more than 88,000 signatures.
In a public statement issued Oct. 14, 2022, HMS said the content on PETA’s website was “misleading.” The school referred to the statement in response to a request for comment on the February letter.
“The video, certain photos, and some of the behaviors described on the website are not from Dr. Margaret Livingstone’s lab, and descriptions related to her methods contain inaccuracies and exaggerations,” the Medical School stated.
In response to a request for comment, Livingstone referred to a public statement she issued on Oct. 24, 2022, addressing the criticisms levied against her, writing, “although we do not pursue maternal attachment as a line of research, our lab made observations on maternal bonding and attachment in the course of other research.”
Livingstone described how the observation was first made with the stillborn infant of Monkey Ve, writing that the lab then provided other macaque moms with “Beanie Babies and soft-cloth toys.” She added that this method is now used as a “comforting measure” for infant macaques abandoned by their mothers.
Livingstone wrote that these observations were helpful for humans by showing that “maternal attachment could be triggered by soft touch” and that they can help create “comforting interventions to help women cope with loss in the immediate aftermath of a miscarriage or still birth.”
The letter also condemned experiments where Livingstone sutured the eyelids of infant macaque monkeys shut for their first year and had staff hide their faces with welders’ masks to study how “abnormal visual experiences of faces” affect “visual and brain development.”
In her response, Livingstone wrote that this procedure was performed in two separate cases in 2016 and that her lab had “no plans to do so again.” She added that the cases “yielded many insights.”
Livingstone’s lab now studies early visual experiences with noninvasive techniques that have caregivers wear facial masks and the monkeys wear goggles.
“Eyelid closure was and remains routine protocol across research labs that study vision disorders,” Livingstone wrote. “This technique, in fact, paved the way for the modern non-invasive methods we use now.”
Catherine Hobaiter, a researcher at the University of St Andrews, and Gal Badihi, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of St Andrews, were two authors of the letter. Both work in the Wild Minds Lab, which previously sent a letter in November 2022 calling on Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences to retract Livingstone’s publication on the maternal attachment of macaques.
The article was not retracted on the grounds that it had successfully passed a review board.
“Our objections here were two-fold — that this work fails in terms of scientific method and in terms of our basic ethical responsibilities as scientists,” Hobaiter wrote in an email, referring to the February letter.
“I spend months at a time following wild chimpanzees and seeing what their natural behavior looks like. And I think that’s why I get so upset when I see the way that nonhuman primates are treated because, to me, their emotional capacity, their pain perception, it all looks so similar to humans,” Badihi said.
On Feb. 8, the Animal Law and Policy Clinic at HLS hosted a panel discussing the experiments. Katherine V. Roe, a neuroscientist working at PETA who was the first to raise concerns about Livingstone’s research, participated in the panel.
Panelists said the stressful living conditions of a lab negatively affect the accuracy of any data obtained from primate experiments.
“Once you take an animal out of the wild and into a lab, regardless of what you’re trying to test, taking them out of their natural habitat, preventing them from doing any of their natural behaviors affects all of this, but most affected are their immune systems, which is where they’re being studied, and their brain, which is where they’re being studied,” said Roe.
In a Feb. 16 interview, Badihi said she hopes for an end to direct experimentation with the monkeys. Instead, she said voluntary experiments such as computer games offer alternative ways to study behavior, while artificial tissues show promise for being better models for drug testing.
According to Hobaiter, animal experimentation is a wider issue which scientists should address.
“Changing study methods and protocols can be a slow process, particularly where individual researchers may feel tied to previous methods because these have become an expected standard in the field,” Hobaiter wrote in an email. “But in tolerating this we continue to enact years of devastating harm on the primates involved — and, importantly, we also stifle progress and change."
“It is bad for the primates and also bad for our scientific understanding,” Hobaiter added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a big fourth-quarter rally from Harvard women’s basketball (15-9 overall, 8-4 Ivy League), Columbia (20-4 overall, 9-2 Ivy League) left Lavietes Pavilion the victor with a 75-70 win last Friday night.
This tight play with the Lions, who share the league lead with Princeton (19-5 overall, 10-2 Ivy League), prepped the Crimson well, however, as they handed Cornell (10-15 overall, 3-9 Ivy League) a decisive 86-59 loss just the next day.
On Friday, head coach Carrie Moore’s crew will head to Princeton seeking a series sweep against a faltering conference powerhouse.
The matchup last Friday night between Harvard and Columbia was the sequel to an 82-56 Columbia win on January 14. This time, though the result was the same, the story was very different: one of four ties and nine lead changes. And a big comeback effort that made for a close game down the stretch.
“The biggest thing I'm most proud of is the fight at the end,” Moore said. “We continued to fight and claw back.”
After battling a lid on the basket for the third quarter that left them shooting only 25% from the field and outscored 26-11, the Crimson’s fight produced 33 fourth-quarter points. This impressive final push was fueled in large part by the play of sophomore guard Harmoni Turner. She poured in four made jumpers, two free throws, two assists, a steal, and a three, all within the ten-minute frame.
Another big contributor on the home team was junior guard Lola Mullaney, leading the team with 22 points on the night. The Rumson, N.J. native was also the star of a pregame ceremony honoring her entrance into the 1,000-point club during a game at Yale earlier in the month.
Mullaney was excited about her “huge accomplishment,” adding, “it was just a really cool moment to share with my teammates especially, and then getting that win at Yale was really exciting.”
Saturday’s matinee proved less of a thrill, as Harvard ran away from the visitors from Ithaca early in the game.
Trading baskets in the first ten minutes left Cornell ahead 14-12, but a long ball from Turner just before the midway point in quarter two put the Crimson ahead for good.
Harvard played a strong all-around game: it tallied 34 points in the paint, while also shooting 51% from beyond the arc, and receiving 25 points from players off the bench. Five players contributed double digits, senior guard McKenzie Forbes with 20, 17 from senior guard Maggie McCarthy, 16 from Turner, 12 from sophomore guard Elena Rodriguez, and ten from Mullaney.
With this win against Cornell, Harvard secured a spot in the March Ivy Madness Tournament, while moving to 75-12 in the teams’ all-time series. In the tournament last year, Harvard fell to Princeton in a five-point heartbreak game.
Harvard has been preparing for its game against Princeton this Friday, which will be an important indicator of how it needs to change its game for the Ivy League tournament. In the history of Harvard vs. Princeton women’s basketball games, 91 in total, the Tigers have won 46 to Harvard’s 45 games.
The Crimson has the momentum necessary to even the series, snapping Princeton’s 42-game Ivy League win streak on December 31 with a 67-59 win. But to complete a season sweep of the reigning Ivy champs – a goal elusive since 2009 – the team is focused on unity and confidence.
“We’ve got to be connected. We've got to come together and stick together and listen to one another and trust one another, and communicate with one another,” the head coach emphasized.
“We just have to come in with the same amount of confidence we did the first time and just stick to the game plan our coaches gave us.”

No. 9 Harvard’s loss to No. 11 Columbia in the ECAC Championships last weekend marked the midway point in its spring season, which continues next month. The Crimson (6-3) has posted overall positive results against top-ranked opponents since the start of the season in January and continues to prove its mettle as the season progresses.
“I think this is a really competitive group,” head coach Andrew Rueb ‘95 said. “They've got a lot of resolve, and they've got a lot of belief in themselves and their teammates. [Those are] the ingredients you need to have a really good season.”
And the team showed just that resolve in its kick-off match in January. After a successful fall season of mostly individual play, Harvard began the spring season with two strong showings in North Carolina, where they faced No. 35 NC State and No. 22 Duke. Senior Steven Sun closed out the Crimson’s hard-fought victory over NC State with his 7-6, 7-6 singles win over Luca Staeheli.
The next day, Harvard prevailed over Duke in a similar fashion, 4-3. This time, it was sophomore Danny Milavsky who clinched the last necessary singles match, 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-1. The match marked Harvard’s first victory over the Blue Devils since 1996.
“It is a learning experience for them,” said Rueb of the close matches in North Carolina. “They really are seeing just how relentless you have to be, and how good the quality is.”
The Crimson’s schedule of play has been full of top-ranked opponents outside of the Ivy League. After the opening weekend in Durham, Harvard traveled to Chapel Hill for the ITA Kickoff, where they posted mixed results. The weekend began with an impressive win over Columbia, 4-2. After losing the doubles point, which is earned by the team that wins two of three six-game doubles matches, the Crimson fought back to take five of the six singles matches.
“If you want to be amongst the best in the country, you have to play them,” Rueb shared.
Harvard’s three-match win streak was cut short when it met the University of North Carolina to close out the ITA Kickoff, 1-4. The Tarheels took the doubles point handily before winning three singles matches to conclude the competition. Milavsky had a straight-set victory against Karl Poling in the fourth position. Ultimately, Anuj Watane seized the third set against Sun to secure UNC’s win, 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.
“They're learning their lessons and making improvements, which is all you can ask for,” Rueb commented. “You want to be playing your best tennis in April and May, and we're on track to do that.”
The Crimson took to the road once again earlier this month to compete against No. 13 Northwestern and No. 3 Michigan which showed more mixed results. Against Northwestern, Harvard put its UNC loss behind them with a 5-2 final score. The Crimson swept doubles to pick up the extra point, after which Walker, Milavsky, and junior Ronan Jachuck took the top three singles matches. First-year Valdemar Pape also secured a singles victory with his 7-6, 6-3 defeat over Gleb Blekher. Michigan proved a more difficult opponent for Harvard, eventually winning 4-3 after a series of incredibly close matches.
The Crimson’s most recent competition, the ECAC Championships, took the team on the road again, this time to New Hampshire, for a preview of the Ivy League competition. Over the weekend, Harvard faced off against three Ancient Eight foes: No. 24 Cornell, Columbia, and Dartmouth.
The Crimson completely shifted the momentum after losing the doubles point and trailing in each singles match to defeat Cornell, 4-1.
“It was looking like the match was going in one direction, and then each person was able to flip the script a little bit and trust their training and make headway,” Rueb said.
Harvard wasn’t able to hang on against Columbia despite their win earlier in the season, eventually losing by a margin of just a few singles points, 3-4. The deciding match was an exciting three-setter between Walker and Michael Zheng, 7-6, 3-6, 6-2.
“These matches are coming down to so few points that anything you can do to increase your chances by one or two percent makes a big difference in tennis,” Rueb reflected.
With the next team competition scheduled for March 13, the Crimson has time to fine-tune skills and find those few key points which have been so important in its matches thus far. The second half of the season will also bring the Ivy League Championships and the NCAA Tournament.
“What we did last year was great,” said Rueb of Harvard’s Ivy League win and second-round finish in the NCAAs. “I think that we'd like to take another step forward and see if we can't go deeper into the tournament.”
The Crimson will host No. 18 University of Virginia, the reigning national champions, as well as No. 54 Virginia Tech and Boston University on March 24-25 for its first home matches of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a sport characterized by its downhill slopes, Harvard’s skiing season has been anything but downhill. The Crimson’s performance in the five races so far has shown great potential, not only for the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association (EISA) regional carnival coming up this weekend but also for the NCAA Skiing Championships to be held in March at Lake Placid, N.Y..
In the five races so far, Harvard’s Nordic and Alpine teams have always finished in the top six, prompting first-year Alpine skier Fredrik Willumsen Haug to claim, “this season has actually been the best season for Harvard skiing ever.”
Willumsen Haug made history during his racing debut for Harvard in the season-opener at the Bates Carnival, becoming the first Harvard Alpine racer in eight years to be on the podium in the grand slalom event at a regular season carnival.
“The first race when I got the podium, that was great,” Willumsen Haug recounted. “That was completely unexpected and also really fun.”
This individual initial success was a sign of the great season that was about to come. Several Nordic team skiers scored career-high results at the next carnival at St. Michael’s College.
In addition to successful outings at the University of New Hampshire and Williams Carnivals, the best indicator of the skiing team’s great season was the Harvard Carnival, hosted by the University on Feb. 10 and 11. It was a show of force by the Crimson who finished fifth out of the 13 teams.
On the Nordic team’s side, senior Rémi Drolet, who took a leave of absence from Harvard to represent Canada at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in cross-country skiing, finished first in the men's 10 km individual start freestyle race. The Alpine team also fared well, with Willumsen Haug and senior co-captain Jack Despres finishing in the top ten in giant slalom.
These wins have moved Harvard’s ski teams into fifth place in the EISA circuit before the final regular season race this weekend.
According to Willumsen Haug, the Harvard skiing teams’ success can be explained by hard work and excellent team spirit. Given that skiing is a winter sport, training during the fall semester consists of strength and conditioning. However, during the extremely short ski season where “there is a very small margin for error and not much predictability,” Willumsen Haug explained that the teams have to wake up at 5:00 a.m. every day to train in mountain ranges, located three hours away from campus, in sessions that conclude by noon so that skiers can attend afternoon classes.
Willumsen Haug also felt that a great and inclusive team culture helped propel the team to its success. He explained that upperclassmen have been “really great teammates and role models, helping me incorporate and get values, ski well, and be a good person.”
Coming from Norway, he was grateful to the team for helping him achieve a flawless and very pleasant transition, crediting his co-captains and “great leaders” on the team for “doing a great job on keeping the team together and making sure everyone is doing the right thing.”
There is a sense of optimism about the future of this team — not only for the NCAA tournament but also for next season. Even though he has already qualified for the final tournament, Willumsen Haug believes that, with a great performance this weekend, there will be more Harvard skiers at Lake Placid this March.
“I think it is going to be a great team next year, like this year but with even more improvements and the coach doing his magic,” Willumsen Haug reflected.

Carter G. Woodson was the second African-American, after W.E.B. Du Bois, to receive a Ph.D. degree from Harvard. In 1915, he created the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH). In 1926, he launched “Negro History Week,” which eventually expanded into Black History Month. Woodson is now widely considered as the “father of Black history.”
Saundra Graham, a local Cambridge activist, speaks into the microphone during a protest at Harvard's Commencement on June 11, 1970. She was joined by a dozen other activists protesting Treeland, Harvard’s planned graduate student housing complex in the Riverside neighborhood. Graham would go on to become the first Black woman on the Cambridge City Council, as well as the first Black woman to represent Cambridge in the state legislature.
On April 10, 1968, the Harvard-Radcliffe Association for African and Afro-American Students published an advertisement in The Crimson with four demands. Their advertisement came less than a week after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and called for an endowed chair for a black professor, more courses pertaining to black students at Harvard, increased hiring of lowever black faculty, and demographically representative admission of black students.
The Hutchins center for African and African American Research was rebranded from the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute in 2013, and is dedicated to researching the culture and history of Africans worldwide. The Du Bois Institute was founded in 1975, six years after faculty approved students' demands to establish Afro-American Studies as a department. Today, the Hutchins center continues to support scholarly engagement in African and African American studies.The center publishes the Du Bois Review (DBR), an academic journal that provides a forum for increased understanding of race and society.
