After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since their 2016 debut, Blackpink have cemented themselves as the uncontested leaders among generations of K-pop girl groups. On paper, Blackpink’s continued dominance seems unlikely. In a ruthless music industry where new groups debut weekly and consumers’ standards demand new comebacks multiple times a year, Blackpink’s discography — just two albums, two EPs, and a collection of singles over six years — should get lost in the shuffle. Yet, on Nov. 14 as Blackpink performed to a sold-out crowd at the Prudential Center in Newark, the group showed how a relatively sparse discography jam packed with chart-toppers has allowed them to stay on top.
The anticipation for the show was tangible as fans flooded the arena, and for good reason. Blackpink’s “Born Pink World Tour,” supporting their 2022 album of the same name, marks the group’s first concerts in the U.S. since 2019’s “In Your Area Tour.” For many Blackpink fans (known as Blinks), it was impossible to do anything but voice their excitement as the group's music videos played while fans scurried to their seats.
When the arena lights went down, the crowd was illuminated by the pink glow of thousands of BI-Ping-Bongs (Blackpink’s hammer shaped lightstick) as videos of each member flashed on screen accompanied by a new round of cheers. The excitement came to a head as giant screens on stage pulled away to reveal members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. The quartet took center stage before opening with a high-energy performance of the unapologetically boastful “How You Like That,” from 2020’s “The Album.”
The show was organized into five acts, each marked with a video package, new outfits, and changing aesthetics. Acts one and two were studded with Blackpink’s biggest hits such as “Pretty Savage,” “Lovesick Girls,” and “Kill This Love.” Between the first hour’s jam-packed dance numbers, Rosé served as the group’s unofficial spokesperson, thanking the crowd and asking audience members to scream as loud as they could during the group's brief breaks. The crowd was happy to oblige, chanting the band's name in time with the opening notes of the group’s most recent single, “Pink Venom.”
In act three, each member had a chance to highlight their unique style and talents with a solo performance. Jisoo took the stage first for an elegant cover of Camila Cabello’s “Liar.” Then with chants of “Jennie” ringing through the arena, the singer took to the stage with a performance of her unreleased track “You & I (Moonlight),” proving her status as a triple threat with a display of her vocal, rap, and dance talent. Having released more extensive solo projects, Rosé and Lisa each performed two abbreviated solo songs. Rosé paired a laidback and vocally impressive performance of “Hard to Love” with a technically precise and seductive performance of “On the Ground.” And while every member shined during their solo stage, Lisa shone brightest with crowd-pleasing performances of the hip-hop track “Money” and her VMA winning song “Lalisa” — an award she took home from the same venue back in August.
With a hip-hop and dance-focused discography, Blackpink could easily forgo live instruments on stage. That’s why it was all the more special that they were joined by a four-piece live band who were highlighted both by the group and during an extended instrumental outro following “Born Pink”’s lead track, “Pink Venom.” The group was similarly supported by a troop of around 30 backup dancers who quickly became one of the most impressive parts of the show. The dynamic dancers raised the bar during the performances to match the grandeur of Blackpink’s bombastic music. The troop even stole the show during the extended dance break of “Pink Venom” after Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa left to prepare for their solo stages.
If any one song defines Blackpink’s group identity, it’s 2018’s “DDU-DU DDU-DU.” With Rosé and Jisoo’s soaring pre-choruses, Lisa and Jennie’s tight rap verses, and a trap inspired dance chorus, “DDU-DU DDU-DU'' is a perfect showcase of Blackpink’s best attributes. For all those reasons and more, it was undoubtedly the favorite among Blinks who danced and sang along from the audience.
The arena quickly grew restless when Blackpink disappeared after a heartfelt performance of “Forever Young.” The assembled Blinks were not shocked by their disappearance, though. Instead, they anxiously awaited the cheerful encore that was sure to be a cherry on top of an already impressive showing. While the encore is typically reserved for the biggest and most high energy hits at most western artists’ concerts, at a K-pop concert, encores are about appreciating and celebrating the fans gathered together. After a short break where fans chanted the group’s name, the members of Blackpink emerged for the final time now sporting an assortment of their own tour hoodies and t-shirts. As they performed the final tracks of the concert — "Yeah Yeah Yeah”, "Stay", and "As If It's Your Last" — the group broke away from their sharp choreographies, using the more laid-back atmosphere to interact with fans by waving and making hearts toward audience members. It was a refreshing change of pace, allowing the members to interact with one another and show their personalities after nearly two hours of meticulously choreographed dance numbers.
As the lights flickered back to life and audience members slowly trickled out, the “Born Pink” logo was replaced by a scrolling list of credits thanking everyone from tour management to security. It was a small but heartfelt moment of recognition for the immense level of work that goes on behind the scenes. From the onstage performance to the lighting and stage design, the “Born Pink World Tour” is proof of Blackpink and their entire team’s continued dedication to creating high-quality performances.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the Peabody Museum apologized for holding a collection of hair samples taken in part from Native American students at government-run boarding schools in the 1930s. Unfortunately, they are about nine decades late. The return of the samples to the families and tribes of the victims does nothing to erase the nonconsensual seizure of their genetic material, which took place under horrific conditions of abuse and cultural erasure; nor does it undo the collection’s likely contributions to the development of racist pseudoscience during the 20th century.
Nevertheless, we appreciate the Museum’s commitment to participating in the ongoing, University-wide reckoning with Harvard’s cruel stewardship of the human remains and cultural artifacts of enslaved people and Native Americans. It’s unfortunate that the return of these hair samples took so long, but we’re glad that it’s happening now.
This case is evidence that the Peabody is moving down a difficult and important path of institutional self-reflection. In the past, we’ve been critical of the Museum’s handling of Native American remains — especially its insufficiently proactive approach to identifying and returning them to their descendants and tribal communities. Just last year, pressure from outside advocacy groups like the Association on American Indian Affairs was necessary to prod the institution toward action on its duties per the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act; today, it’s heartening to see internally-prompted improvement on this front. For the Peabody to truly move towards ethical curation, it must continue to actively search its catalogs for evidence of historical malfeasance. It cannot wait for outside pressure before acting.
As Harvard re-evaluates its institutional relationship with Native American peoples, the University must hold cultural context paramount in its self-evaluation. On a naïve reading, the actions in this case — collection of hair samples and their use in anthropological study — may seem innocuous or even commendable in the pursuit of scholarship. However, in this case, the wrongdoing is clear because of the cultural context in which such actions occurred.
The samples came from students at horribly abusive boarding schools run for Native Americans; children were taken from their families, unable to consent to their enrollment in the schools or their treatment therein. Furthermore, many Indigenous communities place special cultural and spiritual value on hair. The immorality of keeping the samples is rooted in the context in which they were collected. As the Peabody and other Harvard museums rigorously evaluate their past, they must keep that lesson in mind.
We are pleased with the Museum’s announcement as a signal of the institution’s genuine dedication to acknowledging its past wrongs and working toward restoration. We hope this work will continue as rapidly as is feasible. All remains of Indigenous peoples held by Harvard must be returned to their rightful holders — and the Peabody ought not to rest until this task is completed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this year, one of Harvard’s most prominent conservative thinkers, Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, argued that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has not hired a conservative in at least a decade. Anyone who has taken a course with Mansfield knows how the 91-year-old political philosophy professor despises the University administration. Yet Mansfield’s complaints aren’t just those of an old crank mourning the loss of the Harvard of 1953 — rather, they reflect the very real and disturbing decline of ideological diversity at this school.
According to a recent survey by The Crimson, fewer than 2 percent of Harvard’s faculty identify as conservative, compared to more than 80 percent who identify as either very liberal or liberal. The trend is similar with students: The share of incoming conservative-identifying students last eclipsed 13 percent in 2014. Given the statistics, Mansfield’s concern about conservative hires is quite plausible — and clearly reflective of broader institution-wide trends.
The discrepancy between liberal and conservative views at Harvard is especially striking given the University’s commitment to “diversity in all forms,” which it maintains “creates the conditions for dramatic and meaningful growth.” As I’ve argued, Harvard is right that ideological diversity is a prerequisite for serious academic inquiry and good-faith attempts to discover the truth. Yet while Harvard has made tremendous strides in increasing racial and ethnic diversity, it has utterly neglected to ensure a more even political balance among its students and faculty. Although ideological variety is the surest mechanism that forces students to consider new ideas — more so than the color of their peers’ skin or their classmates’ sexuality — the University has completely reneged on its commitment to diversity of beliefs.
Instead, University hiring and admissions practices have fostered an atmosphere where liberal voices are the dominant force on campus, and conservative-minded individuals feel pressure to self-censor their beliefs or publish their opinions anonymously. While the lack of ideological diversity does not matter in the hard sciences, where an instructor’s political leanings do not affect how they present the subject matter, humanities professors’ political identities likely impact how they teach material.
I’ve argued in this column that Harvard’s curriculum should be restructured to force students to engage with a variety of perspectives, but this reform is insufficient alone; the University also needs to hire teachers with varied viewpoints.
The challenges the University faces are real: Harvard Professor Lawrence H. Summers, a vocal advocate for ideological diversity on campus, has pointed out that academia inherently skews progressive because individuals who like capitalism are more likely to work in the private sector.  To compound the situation further, a majority of graduate school alumni identify themselves as either consistently or mostly liberal, meaning the pool of conservative thinkers to draw from is small in the first place.
Yet if Harvard seeks to live up to its reputation as a leading research university, it should throw its resources behind recruiting conservative thinkers. The school is adept at recruiting top-tier talent in fields such as physics, medicine, and history. Why not apply the same commitment to hiring conservative intellectuals?
To many Harvard students — whose political orientation skews left — a push for more conservative faculty may seem backward and out-of-touch. I myself, a moderate liberal, sometimes fall into the trap of feeling that we need not lend credence to opinions that I consider ridiculous. Yet at the same time, conservative beliefs still enjoy broad support in this country, and dismissing them because we personally disagree with them would be provincial.
Broadening political representation in Harvard’s faculty is no easy feat, but as students who desire a robust education, we should not settle for homogeneity in our classrooms. Diversity in all its forms was never meant to be easy, but that does not mean we shouldn’t try.

It’s November once again: the turkeys are strutting down the bike lanes of Mass. Ave; pumpkin spice is coming out of hibernation in a very real way; the rushed few weeks of the syllabus before finals are coming. The foliage is darling, but it’s pitch-black out by 6 p.m. As we trudge through these last weeks before Thanksgiving break, it’s all too easy to lose sight of what’s important — and we can’t let Josh, our beloved forever freshman, get stuck in a rut again. So, FM asked our editors: what can Josh be thankful for?

The sun will still rise and fall, the wind will still rattle the tree outside your window, the crack on the sidewalk will stay right where it is, the taste of your favorite Trader Joe’s snack will never surprise you. This Thanksgiving, be grateful for the simple constancy around you. Thank the world for all of its dependable little things, Josh. Thank the world for what remains when all else fails.

This Thanksgiving, Josh, be grateful for the coming cold. I know, I know. I love sunny, 70-degree days as much as anyone. But, there are so many beautiful things only the cold allows — crisp snowflakes, the embrace of warm wool sweaters and scarves, deep breaths of frigid air that touch the back of your throat and clear your mind. And, perhaps, best of all: the welcoming puff of warm air as you pry open your door on a cold winter night. You’re greeted by your friends, their voices rising over the reliable murmur of your radiator. In that moment, you feel home.

This fall, I spent most of my BoardPlus on flavored lattes: chai, pumpkin spice, mocha. And then the cashier told me I had just 10 dollars left, and I chose to savor a plain one. This year, Josh, be thankful for drip coffee and cream, half a packet of coarse sugar that still dissolves even if you don’t have time to stir it before running off to class. When everything around you seems unsteady, a faithfulness to the tried and true will keep you grounded, just like an old friend, a black turtleneck sweater, a good hug. Oh, and Stat 110 extensions — be thankful for those.

And for Paddy Considine’s performance in this season of “House of the Dragon.” Be grateful for section buddies — the most underrated genre of friend. Be grateful for GPS technology, because, let’s face it Josh, you and I are too incompetently Gen-Z to drive a car and read a map at the same time. Be grateful for early Taylor Swift and late Beatles. Be grateful for morning’s dynamic duo: coffee and a little pastry. And for evening’s: beer and the crossword. Be grateful for that one pot that’s the perfect size to make the right amount of pasta.

Be thankful for the people who think of you when you are far away. For unexpected postcards and spontaneous FaceTime calls.

— Associate Magazine Editor Mila G. Barry can be reached at mila.barry@thecrimson.com.
Josh, sometimes it will feel like nothing in the dining hall tastes the way it’s supposed to. That you can’t possibly eat another Red’s Best Catch. That everything is spiraling out of control — why are they making beef fajita pasta again? Even the potstickers have let you down. And in those times, you must turn to the one thing that, despite it all, is always consistent: potatoes. You must be thankful for that perfect golden crunch, the buttery fluff. You must treasure them all: the freshly fried tater tot, the crisp hash browns, the delicate sweet potato fries. Their savory warmth is the one thing that can liven a dreary day in the dead of winter. Whenever you’re having a rough day, Josh, you can always order fries from the grille and feel whole again. And that is something to be thankful for.

Know that people love you and choose to love them back: If this is work it’s a good kind, and the world moves so fast. Make these moments big enough to rest in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School will stop participating in the U.S. News & World Report’s annual rankings, the school announced Wednesday.
The school’s announcement on Wednesday came just hours after Yale Law School also said it would stop participating in the rankings, which have come under increased scrutiny in recent months amid questions about the methodology U.S. News uses.
Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in an email to HLS affiliates that it has “become impossible to reconcile our principles and commitments with the methodology and incentives the U.S. News rankings reflect.”
“Done well, such rankings could convey accurate, relevant information about universities, colleges, and graduate and professional schools that may help students and families make informed choices about which schools best meet their needs,” Manning wrote. “However, rankings can also emphasize characteristics that potentially mislead those who rely on them and can create perverse incentives that influence schools’ decisions in ways that undercut student choice and harm the interests of potential students.”
Harvard fell to No. 4 in the most recent U.S. News rankings, behind Yale, Stanford, and the University of Chicago.
Manning wrote that multiple law schools, including HLS, have brought their concerns before U.S. News and the U.S. News Law Deans Advisory Board for several years.
He criticized a metric added by U.S. News two years ago that measures student debt at graduation. Manning argued that potential applicants are unable to distinguish whether this metric reflects a school’s generous financial aid or a high percentage of wealthy admits who do not require student loans.
“And to the extent the debt metric creates an incentive for schools to admit better resourced students who don’t need to borrow, it risks harming those it is trying to help,” Manning wrote.
In an email to The Crimson, Madeline Smanik, a spokesperson for U.S. News, wrote that the rankings factor in debt metrics to “support students in their decision about where to attend law schools that are not in a position to offer extensive financial aid.” Smanik added that U.S. News is working with law school deans to refine its use of debt metrics.
Because the debt metric does not consider loan forgiveness programs, Manning wrote in his email, it conveys misleading information to students interested in public service, who would qualify for post-graduate aid.
He added that the rankings’ emphasis on test scores and college grades has incentivized law schools to prioritize academic performance over need when distributing financial aid. The Law School does not offer merit scholarships, unlike several of its peer institutions, including Columbia and the University of Chicago.
“Though HLS and YLS have each resisted the pull toward so-called merit aid, it has become increasingly prevalent, absorbing scarce resources that could be allocated more directly on the basis of need,” he wrote.
Smanik, the U.S. News spokesperson, wrote that the organization is looking for ways to incorporate loan forgiveness into its rankings.
“Harvard is in a position to fund students who opt to pursue public interest and scholarly careers. This is laudable,” Smanik’s email reads. “However, the majority of students are looking for jobs in the open market and the U.S. News rankings are focused on helping them make a very important career and financial decision.”
She also stated that while standardized tests do not fully capture an applicant’s merits, the American Bar Association and most law schools still require LSAT scores.
Manning acknowledged school rankings — when “done well” — can help students make informed decisions while selecting a university or professional school. But he wrote that the methodology and rankings used by U.S. News compromise student choice and harm the interests of applicants.
“For these and other reasons, we will no longer participate in the U.S. News process,” Manning wrote. “It does not advance the best ideals of legal education or the profession we serve, and it contradicts the deeply held commitments of Harvard Law School.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students gathered Monday in the Mather Faculty Deans’ Residence for a celebration of Diwali hosted by Harvard Dharma, the Hindu students association on campus.
Diwali, also known as the festival of lights, is an Indian religious tradition celebrating the “victory over evil and light over darkness,” per Dharma co-president Navin Durbhakula ’25. Mather Faculty Deans Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan and Amala Mahadevan opened up their home to host the festivities.
The Diwali celebrations kicked off with a puja — an act of ceremonial worship in the Hindu tradition — for the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. Harvard Dharma then served a dinner prepared by the seniors in the organization, following its annual tradition.
Durbhakula and fellow co-presidents Karina Mahida ’25 and Suhanee Mitragotri ’25 said they were excited to host the event.
“All the joy everyone has coming out of the event is what made it all worth it, seeing all this hard work come to fruition,” Durbakhula said.
Varshini Odayar ’23 said preparing for the senior dinner made this year’s celebration especially memorable.
“The seniors come together and cook this meal, and I think it's just really wonderful to cook with your peers and spread the love and joy of Diwali,” Odayar said.
Akila Muthukumar ’23, an event organizer, added that hosting this year’s celebration fully in person was a highlight.
“Having watched the past three years of seniors, though not completely virtually, just carry on this tradition and remembering how excited I was as a freshman to watch them leading the prayers and cooking all the food — it was so great to be on the other side.”
Some students said familial tradition played an influential role in shaping their personal meaning of Diwali, with Dharma carrying these traditions into life at the College. For Mahida, Diwali is “a very family-oriented event.”
“Growing up, pujas and kathas, and even just singing bhajans, was such a family-oriented thing, and so being able to share that with the Harvard community was really, really nice,” Mahida added.
Beyond Diwali, Dharma board member Kavya Shah ’23, said “Dharma has probably been the most formative social experience” for him at Harvard.
“I myself am not a Hindu, I'm Jain, but I think that the community has been so open to me and has been a great place for me to explore my faith. So I'm just happy that I can give back,” he said.
Mitragotri said she has made her closest friends through the organization.
“It's a place I have always felt safe and a place I've always felt loved,” she said. “And I really hope to foster that feeling and community for all the freshmen who have joined Dharma this year and for all the other people who continue to join Dharma and celebrate with us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two international law experts discussed how to hold Russia accountable for the invasion of Ukraine at an event hosted by the Harvard Law School and Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday.
The speakers included Yale Law School professor Harold H. Koh ’75, and Patrick W. Pearsall, Director of the International Claims and Reparations Project at Columbia Law School. Koh and Pearsall discussed their experiences representing Ukraine in legal proceedings against Russia before the International Court of Justice.
In February, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drawing international outcry and allegations of war crimes committed by the Russian army.
Koh said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine marked the beginning of “not just one but three wars” between the countries. Beyond the active warfare on the ground, Russia and Ukraine are both involved in “cyber war” and “lawfare,” he said.
“Putin’s short game is force. Ukraine’s long game is law,” Koh said.
When arguing before the ICJ in March, Koh framed the case as one “not about Russia versus Ukraine, but about Russia against the post-war, international legal order,” he said.
Koh said one of the Ukrainian legal team’s objectives was for the ICJ to declare Russia’s actions illegal, which would further “isolate Putin and his allies” and make it more difficult for other countries to support Russia in the conflict.
Later that month, the ICJ ruled in favor of Ukraine, classifying Russia’s actions as illegal and ordering Russia to stop its invasion.
Pearsall discussed the importance of accountability at a time when “the foundations of international law are shaking,” lauding a resolution passed Monday by the United Nations General Assembly aimed at holding Russia accountable for its actions in the invasion of Ukraine.
“It reaffirmed clearly and unmistakably, that when a state commits a wrongful act, it bears responsibility for that act, and that reparations are due,” Pearsall said.
The UN resolution calls for the establishment of an “international mechanism” to provide reparations for individuals who have claims against the Russian army. Pearsall said one way to hold Russia responsible for its war crimes is the creation of a reparations commission, which he said would streamline the process as “the exclusive forum for the resolution of claims.”
Koh said the current legal actions against Russia regarding its invasion of Ukraine will have a significant impact on the future of international law.
“The Iran hostage crisis of the 1970s and into the 80s shaped the next forty years of international law, of which I have lived,” he said.
“Russia-Ukraine will shape the next forty years,” Koh added.

Black alumni discussed their experiences as Harvard students and their thoughts on the College’s past actions during an event entitled “Beyond ‘Fair Harvard’: Perspectives from Black Alumni” on Tuesday.
The Harvard Radcliffe Institute hosted the discussion as part of the Presidential Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery. In April 2022, the committee released a report detailing the College’s history of slavery and discrimination, and its enduring effects.
Harvard Law School professor Randall L. Kennedy, who moderated the event, opened by asking the panelists: “Was Harvard worth it to you?”
Beth Chandler ’88, president and CEO of nonprofit YW Boston, said the different aspects of her identity led to “distinct challenges” while at Harvard.
“Being Black, being a woman, being gay, being sort of mid to lower class — my family, we never missed a meal, but we certainly didn’t have a lot of money,” Chandler said.
Chandler said the support she received from the Harvard basketball team and the Black Student Union made the experience “worth it,” despite these challenges.
“That was a community where I truly felt like I could be me,” she said.
Playwright Antoinette C. Nwandu ’02 said the people were “one of the best resources out of Harvard,” though she did not necessarily feel the experience was worth it.
“As far as my mental health and my self-care journey, Harvard was not particularly worth it. The struggle was real,” Nwandu said. “Nobody in my family really expected me to go to college or really cared whether I went to college one way or another.”
“This is definitely a journey that I’ve been on alone,” she added.
The alumni also spoke of common experiences shared by Black students at Harvard, past and present.
Baratunde R. Thurston ’99, a writer, activist, and comedian, said he and his Black peers were made to feel like they did not belong and “were only there because of affirmative action.”
“Now this Ivy League-dominated Supreme Court is likely to make its way to undoing that,” Thurston said. “So there’s similarities and sort of overlaps or at least shared coordinates of our experience.”
Thurston said Black students should recognize their rightful place at Harvard.
“So many of these systems, whether it’s company diversity efforts, military, higher education, but especially companies in higher education, they want us to feel like they’ve got power, and they just get to trickle it out to us,” Thurston said. “What’s really happening is they’re really lucky that we want to be a part of their club. We make their club cool.”
Chandler advised students to create a strong support system.
“Find the people who will support you, who believe in you, who know you, and who you don’t have to prove yourself to,” she said. “If we don’t believe in us, who will?”
The alumni said they expect more from the University regarding sensitive issues including its connections with slavery and affirmative action.
“They need to accuse these Supreme Court people openly of being the foul and reactionary and scheming and paid-off legalist hucksters that we have on that court,” journalist John N. Woodford ’63 said.
“I think Harvard can and should be far more bold in the action that it takes,” Chandler added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most Harvard students will experience The Game at Harvard Stadium for the first time on Saturday when it returns to Harvard for its 138th playing.
As the festivities return to Cambridge for the first time since 2016, students said they were excited about welcoming back alumni and opening their dorms to guests from Yale. In 2020, The Game was canceled due to the pandemic, and the 2018 iteration was hosted by Harvard but played at Fenway Park.
“It’s really the only time where Harvard exemplifies the school spirit that big Southern state schools have,” Sophia R. Haddon ’25 said. “We’re really academics-focused, so it’s nice to have that one day off.”
Lola N. Mullaney ’24, who is on the women’s basketball team, said she is looking forward to spending time with alumni from her team who are returning to campus.
“This is actually my first Harvard-Yale Game that I’ve been able to go to, because freshman year it was Covid, and then I couldn’t go to last year’s game at Yale,” Mullaney said. “I think it will be a great, fun environment.”
Mari Kikuta ’24, who has also never attended a Harvard-Yale game, said she is excited to join the tailgate ahead of the game with friends from other universities.
“Before Thanksgiving, [it’s] something to look forward to,” she said.
This year, The Game has taken on increased importance as both teams are still vying for the Ivy League championship.
“The prospect of Harvard still being in contention for the Ivy League championship is another reason a lot of people are still interested in and still invested in the Game, not just for the sake of having a game,” Chris J. Canzano ’25 said.
Across campus, each house committee is responsible for providing food and lodging for its sister college from Yale on Friday night.
Grace R. O’Sullivan ’24, who is the community chair for Adams House Committee, said Adams will be hosting Yale students from Saybrook College in common rooms and providing Domino’s pizza.
“I’m sure they’ll have a great time sleeping on the floors,” O’Sullivan said. “So maybe the pizza makes up for that.”
Many houses are also hosting mixers and steins with their Yale sister colleges Friday evening.
Evangeline Liao ’25 said she looks forward to attending Eliot House’s event with its sister house, Jonathan Edwards College.
“It’ll be interesting since I don’t know very many Yale students, so it will be fun and exciting and we get to meet lots of people,” Liao said.
Some cultural and social groups from Harvard and Yale are also planning mixers during the weekend of The Game this year. Yahir Santillan-Guzman ’25, a member of Raza, said he is looking forward to mixing with MEChA, a Latinx organization at Yale.
“It’s going to be a really good opportunity to meet other Latinx students from other schools,” Santillan said.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo wrote that coordinating logistics for The Game took months and included collaboration across University departments and with Yale’s administration. Harvard also communicated with Cambridge and Boston officials about the expected uptick in traffic, he wrote.
Harvard’s Dean of Students Office has been in “at least weekly contact” with Yale to prepare information and space for guests, including providing a baggage check area during The Game for Yale students’ belongings.
Neither Ivy League school is well-known for its school spirit, but Liao said she is excited for that to change during Harvard-Yale weekend.
“I know that some American universities, they have very intense, emotionally involved rivalries,” she said. “But I think the Harvard-Yale one is more just rooted in tradition.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following oral arguments last month, the Supreme Court is set to deliver a decision in the anti-affirmative action lawsuit against Harvard and the University of North Carolina next summer.
Race-conscious college admissions is likely on the chopping block of the court's conservative majority and some experts expect universities to have begun planning for a post-affirmative action world.
Students for Fair Admissions is led by activist Edward J. Blum, who has a long history of opposing race-conscious policies. The group first sued Harvard in 2014, alleging that the College’s race-conscious admissions program violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prevents institutions that receive federal funding from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.”
Following two lower-court rulings in Harvard’s favor, SFFA petitioned the Supreme Court to take up the case, which it did in January.
Experts have long expected it to overturn the precedent it affirmed in the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger.
Richard H. Sander ’78, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said he expects the court's ruling to overturn Grutter on grounds of Title VI or the 14th Amendment or get thrown back to the lower courts.
Despite the uncertainty about how exactly the justices will rule, Sander said he thinks there will be an increase in academic discourse about possible race-neutral alternatives to achieve racial diversity in higher education while the schools await the court’s ruling.
When the Supreme Court last debated affirmative action — after Blum sued the University of Texas at Austin for using race in admissions in 2014 — Sander said higher education officials had begun planning for a decision that declares race-based admissions unconstitutional.
“There was a lot of engagement by university leaders and other people in education about post-affirmative action strategies,” he said. “I went to a couple of conferences in 2014, where there were a dozen academics or thinkers like myself, and then a couple of dozen university presidents. And the topic was basically, ‘what next?’”
“I think those sorts of discussions are starting up again,” he added.
In the event that the court does overturn its precedent, Sander said, the exact changes to college admissions policies on specific issues — like writing about race in college essays — will be decided by the lower courts and schools.
Steven R. Goodman, an educational consultant and admissions strategist, forecasted declines in the number of Black and Latinx students on college campuses if the court rules in favor of SFFA. He specifically cited California as an example — which banned the use of race in admissions for its public universities in 1996.
“I think we’ll see drops,” Goodman said. “Will they be as significant as the drops in California? No, but there’ll be significant drops.”
Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on any ongoing preparations in the event of a ruling against the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister will step down and retire at the end of the academic year after eight years serving in the role.
Harvard Executive Vice President Meredith Weenick announced Hollister’s departure in an email to the University’s central administration Thursday morning.
“From the time he came into the CFO role, Tom brought an intentional focus to deepening understanding across our community of the University’s finances, building consensus around collective institutional priorities, and laying the foundations for long-term financial sustainability,” Weenick wrote.
Hollister, who has served as Harvard’s top financial officer since 2015, is credited with preparing the University for the financial challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, Hollister led recession planning with financial teams across Harvard to ensure the school was well-positioned for future economic downturns.
“Prior to the pandemic, higher education faced ongoing financial pressures that Tom knew we must account for as we plan our operations and financial management,” Weenick wrote in her email. “His diligent planning efforts to prepare for times of financial hardship positioned the University to remain adroit and resilient in carrying out our teaching and research mission through the evolving public health crisis.”
Harvard’s finances have remained resilient throughout the pandemic. After suffering a $10 million budget deficit in fiscal year 2020, the University has enjoyed healthy budget surpluses for the past two years. The school’s operating surplus reached $406 million in fiscal year 2022.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow called Hollister a “phenomenal mentor, a thoughtful adviser, and an extremely sophisticated financial strategist” in a statement in the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
“His understanding of priorities across the University, both at the center and in the schools, has advanced his work with the Corporation and other leaders. He has positioned us well for the future,” said Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow. “We’ve been tremendously fortunate to have benefited from his knowledge and wisdom.”
The announcement comes amid a major shakeup in University leadership. In June, Bacow announced he will retire at the end of the academic year.
Hollister served in an array of financial roles prior to joining Harvard, including chairman and president of Citizens Bank of Massachusetts, chairman and president of Charter One Bank, vice chairman of Citizens Financial Group, and chief operating officer and chief financial officer of Global Partners.
“It has been an incredible privilege to serve the University and to play a role in such a preeminent teaching and research institution, an extraordinary force for good in our world,” Hollister said.
Weenick wrote that the search process is underway for Hollister’s successor. An executive search firm and search advisory committee will be announced in the coming weeks.

If you’ve had even one conversation with me, you know I’m not into sports. But from that one conversation, you will also discern that I hate being left out. So, yes, you will find me in Allston’s pseudo-Colosseum on November 19. And if you, like me, don’t know what constitutes a touchdown nor why so many non-foot limbs are involved in football, read on for ways to not be mind-numbingly bored during our sporty storied tradition.
Make a bingo board
If you *peruse other Flyby articles,* you’ll see that there are certain things that happen at every Harvard football game. A sign referencing Legally Blonde, at least forty people in one section wearing the free One Crimson sweatshirt, a sign referencing Gilmore Girls and… the list goes on. If you can think of 25 of these things, put them all into a bingo board, and you’ll be entertained for hours! The secret is to include one thing that absolutely won’t happen so that the bingo game lasts the whole football game.
Listen to a podcast
Covertly slip an earbud in under your hat and listen to something that can actually entertain you. Serial is back these days, and I was riveted by season one. I also enjoy Normal Gossip and Las Culturistas. You could even listen to a New Yorker short story. Who said sports weren’t intellectual?
See how many waves you can start in a row
This one’s pretty self-explanatory. Fool everyone into thinking you have school spirit, then laugh at the sheeple.
Pick one player’s jersey number and follow them the whole game
It’s not stalking if you’re watching a spectator sport. Just choose a random number (I favor the date of my birthday) and silently root for them. Follow their ups and downs. Construct an imagined narrative of their psyche. Are they a first-year looking to prove themselves? A senior desperately fighting for their last chance at victory? Sorry, my English concentration is showing. This one is extra juicy if you choose someone on the opposite team, so you end up either happy your school won or happy your player won.
Calisthenics
People exercise by running up and down the stadium’s steps every other day, so why not work out on Game Day? Maybe some people on the team are benched, but not you. Do a plank between two bleachers. Do a headstand. Go wild. And you can even get extra calorie-burning action from fighting against the current of students who are just trying to watch the game in peace.
Photoshop yourself into your friends’ photos and take the time to do your homework on an otherwise silent campus
Ok. I know I said I’d go to the game. But just imagine an empty Loker Reading Room. An abandoned d-hall. AN EMPTY YARD. If there’s photo evidence of you at the game, who’s to say you weren’t there? …no, I’ll go. I’ll go. But this is always an option…
… you know, inebriate yourself (responsibly).
But you didn’t hear it from me.
Try these on November 19, and thank me later NARPs. Who said jocks have all the fun?!

Harvard-Yale is happening this weekend. At Harvard. It’ll be a solid two days full of Jefe’s, muddy shoes, getting lost in Cambridge, touchdowns (hopefully), and “yuck fales”.
Or so we think. Because the last time we had an actual Harvard Yale at Harvard was 2016. Between the stadium being under construction and a little global pandemic, it’s been a while since we’ve had a true Harvard-Yale experience on our home turf. So we chatted with two members of the Class of 2020 who were more than willing to give us a play-by-play of their gameday experience in 2016 — which was their FRESHMAN year. Time, what a crazy concept.
Anyways, read on to find out where to be, where not to be, and all the other essentials to having a good time this coming weekend. We chatted with two friends-that-go-way-back Lydia L. Cawley ’20, former Flyby chair, and Priya Gill ’20-’22, former Flyby editor to give you the scoop:
ESD: Harvard-Yale has not taken place at Harvard since 2016 when you were freshmen. [Give us] a rundown of the experience, starting with the night before. Where are the spots to be? Where are the spots not to be?
LLC: I feel like partially this is not gonna be accurate, because Harvard has changed so much since 2016. But back in my freshman fall, people were going to final clubs. I'm pretty sure I went to a final club the night before — it was a much more open door policy.
Looks like there was no #gatekeeping, gaslighting, or girlbossing back in 2016.
~Now, a brief but important interlude on the subject of parties~
JS: Are you familiar with the words Tasty Basty?
LLC: Tasty Basty? Ohhhh yeah, Tasty basement. Yeah…. it was a thing.
~Sorry, Class of 2025. Tasty Basty was a thing long before you got here.~
PG: We [also] went to the Annenberg thing the Friday night before, and we met two handsome Yale rowers, remember?
Take notes, @Harvard men’s rowing.
LLC: Yeah, we met handsome Yale rowers, apparently. Because of the Yale people, there was a line around the block to get into Annenberg. Maybe the event was just for the freshmen — I think it was a first-year committee thing. We wore Crimson crop tops and choker necklaces, because this was 2016 — I’m not recommending that.
PG: You actually wore a velour crop top.
On an unrelated but important note, let the record reflect at this point that during her time at Harvard, PG coined the phrase “river daddy” to denote an individual who can be relied on for a good night’s sleep by the river A legacy worth mentioning. 
PG: But yeah, after [Annenberg and a final club], I think we bounced around. Actually, just find a picture. We probably have such hilarious pictures.
*Scrolls infinitely through camera roll*
*Shows us picture*
ESD: Um. That's a door.
LLC: Where is this? Oh, this is Tasty Basty
That’s right. TBB strikes again. And turns out it was a FLYBY BLOG party in TASTY BASTY. We stay winning. You stay jealous. Unless you comp Flyby ;)
LLC: People went pretty early. I don't know when the actual game is scheduled to happen but we were at the tailgate by 10:30. Definitely wear shoes that you don't care about. At Harvard it's great, because your commute [to the tailgate and stadium] is easier.
Yeah,,, yikes. Imagine having to take a bus to get to your stadium. 
LLC: And Priya at the time made a sign called “Yale Boys, DM me” with her Instagram.
PG, you are an icon.
PG: It's quite chaotic. It's kind of like Harvard-Brown. But it's just bigger, because people get more crazy. And it was divided by final clubs. You had the Spee car with their little flag. You had the PSK, [etc.]
LLC: Yeah I don't know where they got trucks from.
The origin of the tailgate trucks will forever be a mystery. 
LLC: Oh, also EAT FOOD. If you see food at the tailgate, eat it. There'll be some groups of alumni—older alumni like parent vibes. They'll still be drinking, but they'll have barbecue and burgers. So if you see any food from them or Harvard, eat it or stash it.
Like any true Flyby writer past, present, or future, LLC is a lover of free food. 
LLC: We did indeed go to the stadium inside to see the game. The ticket-collecting thing was quite annoying, but I might be confusing it with Yale. I’m pretty sure everyone takes a nap after. Whether it’s because of your substance intake (if you’re 21+ obviously) or you just woke up really early for the tailgate.
LLC: Everyone is so exhausted afterward that Saturday night is quite dead. If you do go out on Saturday, a big meal and a nap is mandatory.
LLC: But the biggest recommendation I have is the Saturday or Sunday after Harvard Yale, just leave. Unless you actually have an exam (which is so rude), there’s no point in school that Monday and Tuesday.
You didn’t hear it from us, but if you haven’t booked your ticket home for Thanksgiving yet 👀
JS: And do you have any final words of wisdom?
LLC: Make it into the stadium. Get enough sleep. Pace yourself. It’s a really fun experience to watch the game, and this might be the only time that a lot of Harvard students actually go inside!
In the wise words of LLC, stay hydrated and stay happy this fine weekend when H-Y finally returns to our hallowed halls. Who knows — maybe in 4-8 years, you’ll be interviewed by us too :)

Besides being an excuse to party for 24 hours straight, there’s a bit more to Harvard-Yale. With the 138th annual Harvard-Yale Game approaching (and the first time it’ll be played at Harvard in six years!), let's take a trip through the ages to rediscover the history of “The Game” and get to the bottom of the strange turn of events that somehow ends with you drinking your Truly and freezing your butt off this weekend.
As one of the oldest ongoing college football rivalries in the U.S. (second only to Lafayette/Lehigh), The Game never fails to lure Harvard and Yale alumni back to their old stomping grounds to relive the good ol’ days. Harvard-Yale is the final match-up of the football season for both Harvard and Yale, fueling the rivalry with what is the most anticipated game of the season (aka the single day we turn into Harvard State).
To throw it all the way back, the first game was played on Nov. 13, 1875, at New Haven’s Hamilton Park. Roughly 2,500 fans pulled up to observe the first match-up, and tickets were sold for only 50 cents (in contrast to the $200 tickets being flipped on every mailing list rn #yikes). Apparently, Yale promised to pay Harvard $75 to play the game (lol Yale, you had to pay us to play you??). Rules for the game were adapted from soccer and rugby, and each team played with fifteen players (for perspective, that is roughly 1/7th of the size of Harvard’s football team today). Harvard won 4-0, but don’t get too excited, because that would be Harvard’s last win for eleven years #rip.
The best part is that after the game, seven Harvard students were arrested in New Haven under the charges of “hooting and hollering in the streets.” Each student was fined a whopping $5.29, equivalent to ~$114 today — that’s 12 whole burritos at Jefe’s.
Then, in 1876, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia founded the Intercollegiate Football Association and adopted new rules. The shape of the ball also changed from round to oval.
The Intercollegiate Football Association was dissolved in 1894, the same year that the “Springfield Massacre” or “Hampden Blood Bath” took place. This game was named for the violence that broke out between the schools; nine Harvard and Yale football players were removed from the game, either due to injury or to fighting with the opposing team. Both schools blamed the other for the violence and didn’t play each other again until 1897 (Harvard banned football as a whole). Though our rivalry doesn’t come to hits and blows anymore… at least I hope… Yale better be ready for us to wipe them nicely this year.
In 1898, the term “The Game” was coined and lives on today. The former Harvard football captain A.F Holden wrote in a letter that the match-up makes “the Yale-Harvard game the game of the season,” giving Harvard and Yale students an annual excuse to tailgate and to post Instagram stories captioned “biiiiig football school #yuckfale.”
Currently, Yale leads all-time wins with 67-61. We’ll let the Yalies enjoy it while it lasts because we’re confident that this year will change it to 67-62 #rollcrim.
