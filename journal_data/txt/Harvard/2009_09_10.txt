Though deserving of other, more flattering titles, “Signal Morning” will go down as 2009’s unlikeliest record. Its story begins in 2000 with the breakup of psych-pop revivalists The Olivia Tremor Control, who, throughout the 90s, had—along with The Apples in Stereo and Neutral Milk Hotel—served as a pillar of the Elephant Six Recording Co., a sprawling collective of indie rock bands based in Athens, Ga. With two of that decade’s finest albums—1996’s “Dusk at Cubist Castle” and 1999’s “Black Foliage”—under their belt, co-songwriters Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss parted ways. Doss went on to pursue solo projects under the moniker The Sunshine Fix, while Hart and the remaining members of OTC reformed as Circulatory System, and released their self-titled debut in 2001.That was eight years ago, and until relatively recently, news from the Circulatory System camp, with the exceptions of a few Athens shows and a brief OTC reunion tour, was frustratingly rare. Around 2005, blogs and message boards buzzed over rumors of a new album—tentatively titled “Blasting Through”—to no avail, and years went by until even the most eager fans reverted to a doubting Thomas mentality. By 2007, it seemed basically impossible that “Blasting Through” would ever see a proper release—more likely its demos would be found decades later in a rented attic, as Elephant 6 projects are wont to do. Finally, in late 2008, Hart revealed a primary reason for the seemingly endless delay: he had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, a sobering reality for fans of the painter (who’s designed all his own album art) and musician. But while some might expect Hart’s disclosure to be a farewell message, it instead marked Circulatory System’s revival: recorded in seven studios over almost eight years, the band’s sophomore album—now optimistically-titled “Signal Morning”—would finally see the light of day.To put it mildly, the album does not disappoint. “Signal Morning” overflows with too many ideas and sounds, even after numerous listens, to possibly cite. It is an astounding collection of lushly-layered pop nuggets delivered with gestalt-like intensity; take “Overjoyed,” Side One’s most boisterous track, as an example. A few seconds of warbling static and electronic beeps lead into a chorus of cellos, each emitting a unique, somber strain. Abruptly, the strings are silenced, giving way to a pounding fuzz-bass line and Hart’s abstract yet compelling musings: “Soon you’ll know that we’ve been here before / and you will know we’ve found this world because everyone is overjoyed,” Hart proclaims, “and everything that you say is magic.” The cellos return as the bass fades into the background, and the melody gives way to an onslaught of feedback and ominous marching drums. The song ends with a few seconds of rapid blasts of static, alternating between the left and right channels. In a mere two and a half minutes, Hart has managed to showcase his labyrinthine inventiveness at its finest.The theme of frenetic propulsion that subsists throughout “Signal Morning” is the album’s most distinct improvement over its predecessor, and its strongest link to Hart’s work with his former band. Where Circulatory System’s melancholic debut was widely praised initially, the album hasn’t aged as well as its OTC counterparts, due to the understandable but largely overblown criticism that the album lacks stylistic variety and lapses too easily into a monotone. Though “Signal Morning” retains many of that album’s lyrical themes, (circular time, nature, nostalgia, and otherworldly transcendence) it’s a closer sonic companion to Hart’s work on “Black Foliage.” This should come as no surprise, since all former OTC members, including Bill Doss, play on “Signal Morning.”“Signal Morning” posits the intricate juxtapositions of 60s pop and ambient noodling of “Black Foliage,” condensed into a frenzied dreamscape, with the volume cranked way up. “Overjoyed” and opener “Woodpecker Greeting Worker Ant”—among others—are some of the loudest, most vibrant songs that Hart has ever released. “Round Again,” the album’s centerpiece and a top contender for its catchiest song, layers guitars and bass over a wall of fuzz and relentless drumming by Jeff Mangum (OTC’s original drummer, later of Neutral Milk Hotel fame). Hart’s vocals, sedate throughout most of his tenure with Circulatory System, suddenly take center stage. “Do you think we can lift this shadow?” he asks, following this question with urgent repetition—“Do you think? Do you think? Do you think?”—until he ends the line with a tinge of bitterness: “Do you think at all?” As a vocal performer, Hart has never sounded more immediate and direct.On the album’s title track, and closing song, majestic piano chords ascend over a din of jangling guitars and trumpet bleats, providing a fitting segue into the eerie coda of this whirlwind record. It proves a satisfying conclusion to this chapter in William Cullen Hart’s life and Circulatory System’s existence. But even without the album’s context—the fans’ long wait, the band’s logistical struggles, and Hart’s unfortunate illness—“Signal Morning” would still stand as a masterpiece of modern pop music, and another fascinating testament to one of its greatest minds.—Staff writer Jeffrey W.

Triumph. This word alone might suffice to describe the long-, long-awaited arrival of “Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… Pt. II,” by Chef Raekwon. The album—the sequel to Raekwon’s 1995 game-changer “Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…”—was initially announced in 2005, but production and label issues left the work dangling in limbo, its public release put on a hitherto apparently interminable hold.But the day for Wu-heads has finally come, and Raekwon doesn’t disappoint. “Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… Pt. II” is eminently satisfying, unabashedly raw, and on par with the best solo albums by any member of Wu-Tang in this decade or the last.Raekwon resumes right where he left off with the first Cuban Linx. It was then that he introduced his Mafioso persona, soulful stylings, and violent, gritty themes, helping to shape the genre that grew into the gangsta rap of the late 90s. Adopting the moniker Wu Gambino to emphasize their grisly underground content, the Wu-Tang Clan propelled Raekwon’s success forward on Cuban Linx, and in turn reaped the rewards from the new niche they pioneered and would continue to dominate in the hip-hop world.As before, the core members of the Wu ballast Raekwon’s Cuban Linx II, but it is the Chef’s rhythmic flow and vivid narratives that shine through the pleasantly understated production and much-touted guest appearances throughout. Though just about any track could be cited to exemplify Raekwon’s particular talents, “Ason Jones,” a tribute to Ol’ Dirty Bastard, is a standout among standouts. “He was a powerful general / The smell from his breath was Ballentine / I think it was the year ’89 / He stayed the freshest…. The nigga could dance to slow music / Outdrink any nigga on the bench / While we hittin’ reefer he so loose / He’s five foot seven / A legend was born / Russel Ason Jones / I know him for his braids and lessons,” raps Kwon almost breathlessly over J. Dilla’s soulful beat.More often, though, Raekwon’s smooth tenor creates a sensational contrast to his narrative persona; Chef Raekwon derives the first part of his name for his skills in cooking crack, and his raps are generally vignettes portraying the ultra-violence of the streets and the drug trade.  “Fat Lady Sings,” for example, tells the story of a drug dealer caught on the wrong corner who, after being beaten and sliced up with razor blades, simply refuses to die. “Sonny’s Missing” has a similar plotline, where a traitor to the Wu Gambino gets himself slowly and torturously whacked for a drug-related indiscretion. These accounts are admittedly brutal, but the combination of the evocative story-telling style and the somewhat fantastical content creates an enthralling scene.But Raekwon couldn’t have pulled off a 22-track album like this one on his own. Credit is due to Tony Starks, aka Ghostface Killah, who contributes his indefatigable charisma and lyrical wit to about a third of the album’s tracks. “Penitentiary” and “Gihad” are two of his better cameos, the former featuring a seamless back and forth between Raekwon as prisoner and Ghost as corrupt jailer and cohort, the latter an alternative tale of father-son relations soured by a woman. Method Man’s appearance on tracks like “New Wu” and “House of Flying Daggers” make them obvious choices for the album’s first singles, as Meth’s militant rhymes and uniquely enthralling cadence are known to draw the masses (and rightly so). Finally RZA’s production on a number of tracks and involvement with the project as a whole gives the album a raw, understated feel that pairs well with the lyrical content and puts the rapping front and center instead of the beats.With all its grit and top notch lyricism, “Only Built 4 Cuban Linx… Pt. II” is more than just a great sequel. It’s testament to the vibrancy and strength of the gangster hip-hop culture, filling a void left manifestly and painfully vacant with the rise of the Auto-Tune and the increasing move of gangster rappers toward the pop genre in recent years. Raekwon and his Wu-Tang accompaniment dazzle on every track, and demonstrate that they can continue to thrive in the niche they created for themselves in the early 90s without getting dull or dated.—Staff writer Joshua J.

With “Heartbeat Radio,” Sondre Lerche delivers an album best characterized by a boyish whim and charm. His music is easy to like but also offers diverse elements of musical sophistication, giving him a universal appeal. Lerche released his first full-length album, “Faces Down,” in his native Norway eight years ago, and since then he has steadily acquired a devoted and loving fan base. He was brought to a wider audience in North America by his work on the “Dan in Real Life” soundtrack, released in 2007. Throughout his career, the singer-songwriter has dabbled in jazz, orchestral sounds, straight-up rock, or wherever his fancy took him. His sixth studio album presents a mature artist that has found and settled comfortably into his own layered pop sound. Now able to draw from experience, Lerche takes the elements that worked best from his previous albums and brings them together; the record blends in remarkably well with the fabric of his career. Even first listeners of Sondre Lerche will find that there’s something immediately recognizable about him; his lyrical simplicity and warm vocals provide an inviting quality. This may draw criticism for lack of innovation, but as in the best pop music, catchy melodies and lush harmonies are always rewarding. What makes Sondre Lerche’s work—including “Heartbeat Radio”— stand out amongst other immediately enjoyable pop music, is its deceptive simplicity. Lerche is very much fascinated by a wide variety of genres, including jazz and rock, and with childlike absorption, incorporates them to his own sound. As a result, even his choice of acoustic guitar as the basis for many of his songs—fairly typical for singer-songwriters—becomes distinctive through his unusually syncopated rhythms and complex, bluesy chords. The title track is the most obvious example of this; its intro is marked by an emphasis on the off-beat. The drums, entering in the second verse, match the syncopation of the acoustic guitar perfectly, as the electric guitar pronounces the off-beats. A piano nonchalantly doodles a jazz riff. On top of all this is a string quartet that serves to double the melody and also support it with fugal harmonies. All of these elements come together and create a balanced song, at once energetic and easy on the ears. The choice of “Heartbeat Radio” as the title track seems an appropriate one. The satisfyingly intricate sound of this first single is one that pervades the album. Even low-key songs like “I Guess It’s Gonna Rain Today” and “Goodnight” incorporate multiple instruments, including a full brass band for the former. Lerche manages to contain the varied instrumentation, giving the song a sense of complexity without overwhelming the ballad.  Lerche presents a variety of style in “Heartbeat Radio,” as well. Songs like “Words & Music,” and “Easy to Persuade” rely heavily on distorted electric guitars and less on orchestral pop elements, creating a sharper sound. The relentless drums and rock riffs are reminiscent of his experimentation with rock in his 2007 album, “Phantom Punch.” Like his music, Sondre Lerche’s lyrics are at first familiar, yet distinctly charming. Perhaps because English is not his first language, he approaches clichés and idioms with a delight that turns them for the better. “You can push me away, but I cannot let you go / try as you may, no, I cannot let you go,” sings Lerche. A very typical pop lyric, but here, sung by Lerche, it is filled with a rare sense of optimism, brought out by the playful rhyme. Sondre Lerche is really just an extraordinarily pleasant everyman, whose magic resides in incorporating jazz pianos and orchestral strings in his music while managing to stay completely unassuming and unpretentious. His music may lack originality, but that won’t stop it from being stuck in your head all day. —Staff writer Susie Y. Kim can be reached at yedenkim@fas.harvard.edu.

Though childless, Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley have always exuded a parental quality. This has been more or less intuitive to me, as they met around the same time my parents did. For over a quarter of a century, their influence has tenderly guided listeners through the rough thickets of musical history, introducing them to near-forgotten artists like the Flamin’ Groovies and the Only Ones. They tell jokes, they like holidays, they’ve even got a funny, pudgy friend who won’t stop coming over (James McNew, faithful bassist of 17 years). Entering the swells of middle age, Hoboken, N.J.’s finest trio finds itself being pulled in disparate directions. “Popular Songs,” like Yo La Tengo’s last album—the colorful, horn-filled 2006 pastiche “I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass”—touches on an array of different genres and styles. The middling songs on “Beat Your Ass” were often indistinguishable and therefore inoffensive; the same cannot be said for “Popular Songs.” Each track here is crafted and orchestrated, nurtured and cared for. This means that the highlights here are just as high, if not higher, but the lows are more prominent as well.In the midst of swirling bells and dense backing harmonies, “Avalon, or Someone Very Similar” finds Georgia in the highest of vocal registers, channeling sometime collaborators the Magnetic Fields circa “Wayward Bus.” Lush pockets of jangle-pop slowly expand and burst, growing fuller with each verse, culminating in a heavenly guitar solo. “Nothing to Hide” is more ragged but still impeccable. Drawing on the raw, garage-rock sensibility of “Fuckbook” (the March LP of their alter-egos, Condo Fucks), the band refines the genre with more polished harmonies, precise rhythms, and bright, crisp organ.The album’s centerpiece comes, fittingly, at song 6 of 12 tracks. “If It’s True” begins with a bass line immediately echoed by soaring strings. Sonically, it’s a perfect, retro pop gem­—a lost Four Tops hit coated in pre-fab shimmer and organ flourishes. Though certain cutesy lyrics seem quite in keeping with Motown simplicity (“Let’s make jam when life gives us a peach”) the song maintains a meaningful ambiguity. Joining the ranks of great uncertain love songs, “If It’s True” embraces the unknown, with the band pledging solidarity even as they question the notion of soulmates, romantic or otherwise (“Maybe it’s not quite right / But we’ll find out if it’s true”). Clocking in at just over two and a half minutes, the tune captures Yo La Tengo at their best and briefest.This is not to say they’ve forgotten how to write longer jams, although in a mysterious lapse in judgment they pack the three longest songs in a row at the album’s end. These songs comprise a prodigious 37 minutes (longer than a few of their early LPs), and only one of them seems essential. “The Fireside” drones and wanders but never ignites; closing number “And the Glitter is Gone” picks up where “Beat Your Ass” extended intro “Pass the Hatchet” left off, but can’t register the same urgency without handclaps and vocals. “More Stars Than There Are in Heaven” is the most successful, relying on a slow buildup of fuzzy drums and airy guitar. The refrain is simple—“We’ll walk hand in hand”—but the way Ira draws out each syllable creates a melodic intensity that rises and falls in waves, in sync with the guitars and driven by the pulsing bass. Though the song gradually builds, it never explodes. Restraint seems in many ways totally at odds with this band—given their endless supply of cover songs, not to mention records—but here it works, preserving an internal rhythm that cycles throughout the song.Like all parents, Yo La Tengo occasionally fail to engage their listening audience. The uninspiring “By Two’s” is the album’s requisite snoozer, James McNew’s sole vocal performance (“I’m on My Way”) is pleasant but forgettable, and spacey, grandiose opener “Here to Fall” sounds decidedly and eerily unlike them—distant, cold, and weirdly hollow. But in the end, the band fulfills their weighty responsibilities, protecting their impressive legacy as they steer and educate their offspring. Though at times long-winded, Yo La Tengo maintain their status as the wisest of authorities, full of surprises and always worth listening to. —Staff writer Jessica R.

Back in 2003, while Jay-Z was busy planning his retirement party at Madison Square Garden, critics and fans alike were sharing a knowing smirk and gathering on forums to place bets on the release date of his inevitable comeback album. Surely the Bob Dylan of hip-hop wouldn’t be able to stay away from the studio for long before whipping up another street-lauded aural epic of ghetto American dreams. Six years later, the former Marcy Projects hustler has confirmed these suspicions with three post-retirement studio releases and a smattering of collaborations and compilations, but on “The Blueprint 3,” his eleventh LP, Jay-Z aligns quantity with quality, reaffirming his status as one of hip-hop’s greats.Instead of chopping just one lyrically weak foe down to size with his usual scathing battle raps, Jay sent a whole slew of cookie-cutter rappers running for cover in early June with an airwave alert in the form of “D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune).” Throwing down the gauntlet to a burgeoning generation of indistinguishably mechanized MCs, Jay holds no punches, rattling off a list of rap game faux pas: “You boys’ jeans too tight / your colors too bright / your voice too light.” Dangling his past commercial successes before these young wannabes, Jay-Z taunts, “I know we facing a recession / but the music y’all making gonna make it the Great Depression.”It’s been over a decade since Jay-Z could truly lay claim to the hard-knock life, and with a fortieth birthday approaching this year, it’s easy to assume that perhaps “The Blueprint 3” only amounts to the crotchety grumbling of a disconcerted old-timer, unsettled and upset with the ungodly direction in which youth culture is headed. Yet Jay-Z does more than simply advocate for the good old days of baggier pants and violence-inducing rhymes, rather offering a long-overdue invitation to up-and-comers to test the waters of innovation, noting on “D.O.A.,” “I don’t be in the project hallway / talking about how I be in the project all day / that sounds stupid to me.” On “Off That,” Jay-Z even pairs up with newcomer Drake to denounce some of the ostentatious antics rappers are best known for, including “steady chasing the fame,” “oversize clothes and the chains,” those that are “still makin’ it rain,” rims, and Timberland boots.Paired with the distinctly tweaked soul sound of Kanye West, “The Blueprint 3” plays out like a smoky reminiscence of days gone by with equal parts bravado and modesty. On “A Star is Born,” he graciously plays the part of the seasoned champion, asking for applause on behalf of Wu-Tang Clan, Kanye, 50 Cent, T.I., Eminem, Outkast, and several other noteworthy MCs, while simultaneously passing the torch to Lil’ Wayne and Drake and placing himself in a class above all the rest. The boasts aren’t unfounded—guest verses and hooks by the likes of Rihanna, Swizz Beatz, Young Jeezy, J. Cole, and Alicia Keys, along with a couple of ill-conceived Timbaland-produced tracks mostly serve as filler that only distract from the main attraction.Luckily, the scrappy kid from Bed-Stuy hasn’t been completely put to rest, as evidenced on “Already Home,” featuring Kid Cudi. Jay-Z’s normally smooth, swaggering vocals veer towards ragged exasperation while he rebuffs his critics’ futile attempts to render him irrelevant: “But really the fact is, we not in the same bracket, / Not in the same league, don’t shoot at the same baskets, / Don’t pay the same taxes… / So how am I in the way, what is it I’m missing?” Likewise, on “Forever Young,” he reassures us, “When the director yells ‘Cut,’ I’ll be fine, I’m forever young.” In an increasingly commercialized genre that’s lost some of its finest lyricists in the glow of their youth, a living legend’s promise to stick around is certainly well-received. While a true retirement is inevitably in the works for Jay-Z at some point in the future, his latest effort is less a vain attempt at new heights than an expertly crafted reminder of just how he reached the top in the first place.—Staff writer Roxanne J. Fequiere can be reached at rjfeq@fas.harvard.edu.

Philosophers call it the “substratum,” and chefs call it “umami,” but the universal word for it is “subtlety.” It’s that Mona-Lisa-smile component that separates the merely good from the eternally memorable. Thousands of people have tried to describe it, but to little—if any—avail. And so the movie “The Burning Plain,” written and directed by the Mexican screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, is the latest work to remind us that art and alchemy are not so different. At the risk of seeming to gush, no description will do the film justice. In both script and direction, Arriaga reaches for many familiar ingredients. But the result this time is different. You’ll recognize the Arriaga style from his previous films “Babel,” “21 Grams,” and “Amores Perros,” all directed by Arriaga’s close collaborator Alejandro González Iñárritu. Each concerns a group of strangers connected by life-shattering catastrophe, their fragmented lives eventually drawn together under one sweeping narrative.  While Arriaga’s films have always impressed, Iñárritu’s direction set them spinning at a frenetic pace with only their own centrifugal force seeming to hold them together. Directing his own work for the first time, Arriaga reveals a stillness at the center of “The Burning Plain” that one wishes had appeared in his earlier work. For any director to make sense of one of Arriaga’s screenplays is remarkable, but for a first-timer to create a film of such elegance shows preternatural directorial insight. No actress in Hollywood better embodies stillness and frenzy than Charlize Theron, the bombshell whose statuesque grace has been the X-factor in films from “The Cider House Rules” to “Monster.” Arriaga conceived of the movie with Theron in mind, and told Vogue’s Kevin Conley that he did so because “she can act to silence.” Theron plays Sylvia, whose physical and emotional scars are the keystone to a multigenerational arc of love, betrayal, and loss. As in “Babel,” this arc spans multiple countries as well, straddling the border between Texas and Mexico and leaping up to the coal-gray coast of Oregon. “Babel” was a story of alienation, but no matter how far apart “The Burning Plain” flings its characters, none ever lands beyond redemption. Scars appear frequently in the film as indelible reminders of both trauma and happiness; either way, the past is always present. A full list of the many symbols Arriaga employs would indicate the work of a ham-handed artiste and a precocious directorial newcomer. But his recurring images are more reminders for the attentive viewer than the tools of the director’s agenda.  Admittedly, the direction is not perfect. The story only begins to cohere around the 40-minute mark, helped along by the introduction of Jennifer Lawrence as Mariana, a teen whose mother’s affair forces her to grow up too fast. Lawrence has already received the Marcello Mastroianni Award for emerging actors at the Venice Film Festival—an honor previously given to fellow Arriaga actor Gael García Bernal—which her bracing performance richly deserves.  Although uniformly believable, the remaining cast does not reach Theron’s or Lawrence’s level. As the guilty mother, Kim Basinger is so shakingly fragile that she comes dangerously close to over-acting, which is frustrating given the subtlety of the rest of the film. J.D. Pardo is effective but one-dimensional as the son of Basinger’s paramour, and José María Yazpik is intriguing in a small role performed entirely in Spanish.  To attempt to elaborate any more of the characters, plot, themes, or images would be both futile and unfair, as any intelligible explanation would also spoil the ending. Only one thing is apparent from almost beginning to end: Oscar season has arrived.—Staff writer Jillian J. Goodman can be reached at jjgoodm@fas.harvard.edu.

In the early minutes of New Years Day, at the turn of the millennium, while most New Yorkers were partying or panicking about Y2K and its accompanying Armageddon, 150 coked-out people in orange jumpsuits came tumbling out of a Manhattan warehouse, breathing fresh air for the first time in months. These individuals were living their last hours under 24-hour surveillance in an underground bunker—complete with shooting range, communal showers, and bedroom cubicles. Behind this “social experiment”—entitled “Quiet: We Live in Public”—was internet mogul Josh Harris, who lived alongside his subjects until the cops busted them shortly after midnight. Harris was the founder and CEO of Pseudo.com, an early 90s internet network that he predicted would take down CBS and NBC. While others were mastering the basics of HTML, Harris was instituting the first online chat rooms and becoming a multi-millionaire. Called the “Warhol” of the internet world by New York Magazine, Harris commissioned his artist friends to do as they pleased in the Factory-esque office space of Pseudo. His unorthodox management style (which included dressing up as a clown when investors toured the office) eventually led to the company’s bankruptcy in 2000; Harris even fled to Africa to avoid mounting debt. Despite his disappearance, his many endeavors have not gone unnoticed, thanks to American filmmaker Ondi Timoner and her latest documentary, “We Live in Public.” Timoner presented the film in person last week at the Brattle Theatre. Timoner—the only person to win two Grand Jury awards at Sundance in one category (documentary)—was initially unsure about the venture when Harris contacted her. “I didn’t know what the heck he was talking about when he called me to ‘document cultural history,’” Timoner recalls. “He wouldn’t tell me.” The director was in the process of another film at the time, but as soon as she saw the warehouse in person, she was sold. “I didn’t know what it was exactly, but that it should be documented,” she says. Not only did the residents sleep in cubicles and watch footage of each other having sex and defecating, they also were subject to periodic interrogations in a white square room, where some of the film’s most moving and vulnerable scenes take place here. Once she signed on to the project, Timoner embarked on a 10-year journey with Harris, documenting his rise, fall, and various experiments, including one in which Harris and his former girlfriend Tanya installed surveillance cameras in their apartment and aired their lives on the internet for 100 days. At first it seemed fun, even practical—Tanya could ask the camera if anyone had seen her keys, and a viewer could answer her via web chat on the show’s website—but ultimately it led to the couple’s violent break-up. Although he accompanied Timoner to Sundance, Harris has yet to see “We Live in Public,” which features surveillance footage from his experiments, archived media coverage, and numerous interviews with his colleagues, friends, and subjects. Timoner describes her film as a “cautionary tale,” highlighting the consequences of a technology-based childhood. Much of the film is devoted to Harris’ upbringing and his relationship with his mother, whom he refused to see even on her deathbed. Interviews with Harris’ brother, in particular, reveal how he went from television addict to internet geek to friendless, heartless mad scientist. Though Timoner refers to herself as a “freak magnet,” the film has a surprisingly sympathetic gaze, making it much more than a voyeuristic expose of a socially-stunted creep. Timoner has a way of gaining inside access to her subjects—who’ve ranged from an extremist Christian cult in South Carolina to the Dandy Warhols on tour—by fully integrating into their world. She even occupied her own cubicle in Harris’ Manhattan bunker and is currently distributing the film herself across the country. While there was pressure to release the film when she began shooting, Timoner is thankful for the social relevance brought on by the 10-year delay and the explosion of social networking sites. “We were running to join them as fast as people had been running to join the bunker,” Timoner recalls. “I’m glad we didn’t put the movie out back then.” As the first decade of the new millennium draws to a close, Harris’ experiments as captured in “We Live in Public” force the audience to pause and consider the bluescreen cubicles we now occupy. —Staff writer Mia P.

Mike Judge loves to hate the workplace. With his new film “Extract,” the writer/director (“Office Space,” “King of the Hill”) serves up his signature dish of nine-to-five disenchantment with a hearty helping of general human stupidity. Unfortunately, somewhere in the mix, Judge forgot a vital step of the recipe, and instead of an understated cult classic a la “Office Space,” we’re teased with a film that could have been delicious but now just tastes undercooked. “Extract” stars Jason Bateman (“Arrested Development”) as Joel, the CEO of a successful extract-making company called Reynold’s. Joel has a BMW, a beautiful home, and an offer from General Mills to buy his company, but alas, none of this matters to Joel; he’s mostly concerned about not getting laid. His wife Suzie (Kristen Wiig of “Saturday Night Live”) is thoroughly disinterested in her career, her marriage, and her sex life. This leads Joel to masturbate in shame nightly, often followed by a good cry as he bemoans his situation to his friend/bartender/drug dealer Dean, played by a very hairy Ben Affleck. Dean is what most well-minded people fear most: a stupid man in the position to influence the actions of at least one important person. In the midst of mistakenly giving Joel horse tranquilizers and advising him to cheat on his wife with hot new temp Cindy (Mila Kunis, “Forgetting Sarah Marshall”), Dean convinces Joel to hire a gigolo to seduce Suzie in order to lessen his guilt about his own planned indescretion. Heavily drugged, Joel agrees to the sexual hire, not knowing that the girl he’s aiming to cheat with is, in fact, a con artist manipulating his underlings in order to bankrupt Reynold’s. Couple this with the threat of a strike from his array of imbecile employees, and Joel’s life becomes a colorful assortment of comedic fruit.Despite the presence of acclaimed actors like Bateman, Wiig, and J.K. Simmons, the film is stolen by the pimp-and-gigolo team of Dean and his Brad (Dustin Milligan of “90210”). The first 30 minutes are held together by the stringy threads of Affleck’s beard. His balancing act of caring friend and self-interested opportunist creates a comedic rhythm that carries the film. And just when the comedic burden of the movie becomes too much for Dean, in walks Brad the gigolo. Brad’s simpleton nature (he ditched a career in landscaping because he prefers round-the-clock sex) creates the most plausible character M.O. of the film. Milligan’s performance of borderline mental retardation in the body of an Adonis is surprisingly touching. Despite the fact that he has slept with Joel’s wife numerous times, even Joel can’t help but feel sorry for him when Suzie refuses to return his affection. Like a dog, Brad certainly knows better, but he’s also this movie’s best friend. Such over-the-top hijinks are appropriate for well-placed minor characters like Brad and Dean, but they can’t make a central protagonist, and this is where the movie falls apart. Peter Gibbons—the programming anti-hero of “Office Space”—worked as a character because his depression and desperation perfectly highlighted the suffocating workplace tedium in which he lived. Joel, by contrast, simply comes off as whiny; there seems to be a gaping disconnect between his actual problems and his emotional priorities. As his company barrels toward financial ruin, Joel’s complaints about his lackluster sex life seem utterly removed from anything that should matter. The real dissatisfaction comes at the end of the movie when it becomes clear that the characters don’t change or learn from their experiences. Joel’s happiness is briefly touched on in his final managerial decision, but what about his marriage, Cindy’s swindling, or the workers’ general ineptitude? In the end, Judge gives his characters one collective “get out of jail free” card, freeing them from their messy mishaps. This superficial resolution fails to pull together the film, breaking it as a result. Though “Extract” does provide its fair share of funny moments, the film is like a sloppily-mixed batch of cake batter. The sugar chunks taste good, but it’s not exactly Carvel.—Staff writer Jessica O. Matthews can be reached at jmatthew@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among the capricious fashion cognoscenti, tastemakers can command respect and recognition for half a season or half a century. The once fabulous, now floundering House of Halston struggles to recapture its Studio 54 panache, while Chanel’s Karl Lagerfield still woos critics with slightly tweaked versions of a flapper’s little black dress. Despite the rapid flux of the industry, R.J. Cutler ’83—director and executive producer of “The September Issue”—has managed to capture and eternalize an iconic moment in fashion history, and with it, an intimate look at the foremost fashionista of past 20 years. Amidst fashion’s pop cultural boom, awash with reality television shows and mediocre celebrity clothing lines, Cutler managed to wriggle his way into the offices of Vogue—the last bastion of classic luxury journalism—to chronicle the creation of a single issue in his new documentary.At the helm of this extraordinarily influential monthly fashion tome is editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Her ubiquitous sunglasses and the withering glare behind them provided fodder for “The Devil Wears Prada,” a book and major motion picture centered on an unnecessarily cruel caricature of a boss—one part business savvy, three parts bloodthirst. Yet “The September Issue” showcases a witty, driven businesswoman with a demanding work ethic, not unlike that of Cutler himself.“My training was fairly intensive,” Cutler recalls of his involvement in the arts at Harvard during the 80s. Working towards a special concentration in Dramatic Theory and Literature, he cut his teeth as a director in a number of campus productions. “I directed a play or two every semester that I was an undergraduate,” he recalls. “And then after I graduated, I worked at the A.R.T. and taught at the Institute for Advanced Theater Training [during] its very first year.”Further postgraduate endeavors led Cutler to produce “The War Room”—a documentary directed by D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus about Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign—followed by a string of other producing credits, including “Thin,” a 2006 documentary focusing on the rehabilitation of women with life-threatening eating disorders. While the production of a magazine hawking $4,000 wool coats may seem like something of a departure from Cutler’s more serious subject matter, he insists that the industry is worth exploring. “I’m really just telling stories about people,” he says. “Anna was a subject who struck my curiosity. [She’s] a remarkable figure not only in the fashion world, but in the business world.”Aside from directorial and executive decisions meted out with even-toned precision, Cutler goes behind the shades to delve into Wintour’s personal life with interviews and visits to her home. “I was very clear from moment one that I was there to tell the story about Anna, what she does, how she does it, and who she does it with,” Cutler says. “But she knew that I was interested in who she was a person.” The film also focuses on Wintour’s infamous professional relationship with creative director Grace Coddington, a fire-haired industry veteran who harbors enough warmth and emotion to fend off nearly all of her co-worker’s stinging barbs. Exercising “complete creative control” over the project, Cutler and his crew spent months in and around the Vogue offices during preparation for the September 2007 issue, which tipped the scales to become the largest magazine in history at over four pounds. The Fashion Bible’s glossy cover invited readers to partake in “840 pages of fearless fashion,” featuring a coquettish Sienna Miller clad in a feathered gown, her hair swept back in a severe, piecey bun.“The industry was thriving, and everybody knew the industry was thriving,” Cutler notes of his time spent at Vogue. Since the publication of that sartorial magnum opus, the nearly 120-year-old magazine has suffered a downturn in size and ad pages, making “The September Issue” seem like an unknowingly somber look at an era of excess gone by. Cutler insists that the ostentatious wealth was not a focal point during filming. “I think one of the things the film succeeds at doing is showing the incredibly hard work and artistry that is pervasive through the industry, even while it has a frivolous side,” he says. “If you were thinking about the cycles of boom and bust, you imagined that there would be a downturn at some time, but it’s not like people were smoking hundred-dollar bills.”Like the ebb and flow of Vogue’s parent company Conde Nast’s bank accounts, it’s clear that Cutler’s newfound fashion industry fame will eventually wane. Even as he promotes “The September Issue” across the globe—backed by Wintour’s own support—he is already thinking ahead to future film projects, though he confesses to a certain lingering fascination with the glamorous life. “I remain curious about the work that [the Vogue editors] do, as well as this industry that I’ve come to know so well.” Such is the enduring allure of Vogue, which seems destined to preserve its relevance through whatever straits lay ahead.—Staff writer Roxanne J.

The problem with performance art is that it rarely leaves a physically lasting imprint. A phenomenon that graces street corners, park centers, and stages, this art form is inherently transient—miss out on one show, and you’ll never see anything exactly like it again. Meme Gallery, a new institution in Central Square, has devoted itself to extending the fleeting life of ephemeral works, and to providing them, often for the first time, with a legitimate home.Meme is housed in a one-story building once home to a travel agency. The gallery is an anomaly in a block of residences—a small, detached structure with an unremarkable exterior. One of the owners, Vela Phelan, describes it as “a little cabinet in the city.” Phelan and four other performance artists partnered with Bradley Benedetti to create Meme, which opened its first show in June; Benedetti was an owner of the space in its previous incarnation as Gallery 55.The five artists­—Phelan, Dirk Adams, Alice Vogler, Sandrine Schaefer, and Phil Fryer—who all have a background in the Boston performance art scene, felt unsatisfied with the space and conditions they had to exhibit their work. However, these Boston-based groups were limited by their marginal status and brief performances, often displayed in illegal locations. “We all three [of Mobius] felt at the same time that we were searching for something else,” Vogler says.The concept behind Meme is one which pervades our daily life. On the Red Line, under the seats on the ventilation grates, is a repeating pattern: three vertical lines, followed by three horizontal lines. To most, this is the kind of detail which has little meaning, but to Adams, it was the word “meme” written over and over. The pattern—and the word it encodes—stuck, and became the logo of the Gallery.The word ‘meme’ stems from the Greek word, mimema, defined as “something imitated.” It is a cultural unit as basic to our thoughts and ideas as a gene is to our biological makeup. Like performance art, it survives by being transferred from person to person, but evolving as it does. It is a word that easily applies to a gallery that traffics ideas more so than saleable products. Yet the owners insist that the cultural connotations of the Gallery’s name were an afterthought. It is exactly this kind of accidental hipness that characterizes the laid-back gallery. “What we’re doing feels new and exciting and a little off the grid,” Phelan says.The Gallery has focused on giving space to performance art in an effort to make it more “permanent.” With Meme, Schaefer says, “We wanted to create something that gives artists the opportunity to have shows for more than one or two nights.” Having a traditional space also gives a larger audience a chance to see the performance art. “The relics of performance art are amazing and often a show in itself,” Vogler says.Meme’s current exhibition, which will run through September 19, is entitled “What (of Me) Can Only Be Seen by Others.” Its creator, Jacob R. Ireland, used a portrait of the occultist Sylvan Muldoon as a guide for three large faces drawn faintly in graphite on the white walls. In the center of the space, Ireland placed a text which melds the words of Muldoon, Marcel Proust, and Roland Barthes. It has attracted diverse crowds—artists with cuffed pants having conversations on lucid dreaming, wandering children, a man who looked at the seemingly blank walls and inquired when the gallery was going to install the exhibit. “We’re starting to tell the artists that if you leave the door open, you’re probably going to get people coming by… so there are all these levels of people being familiar with the work and the space,” Adams says.Though the curators were not really looking for a gallery, they have found a space in Cambridge for art that was often pushed underground in Boston. “We were going around galleries and we couldn’t really envision our art there,” Schaefer says. Now that they have Meme, the curators are letting it take its own course. “Whatever it is, it’s happening on its own through us,” Phelan says.                                                                                            —Staff writer Rebecca J.

The remnants of silver saltcellers and forks on display in the Peabody Museum reveal more about the history of Harvard than might at first be obvious. In the 17th century, tableware, rather than designer bags, served as college status symbols; students weren’t provided with silverware and would instead bring their own. Those who couldn’t afford to do so, however, were forced to eat with their hands. The “Digging Veritas” exhibition at the Peabody Museum displays these items and others uncovered over several years of Archaeology 1130/1131: “Archaeology of Harvard Yard,” and explains their social implications. First offered in 2005, Archaeology 1130 is about to break ground for the third time. The first batch of Archaeology 1130/1131 students began digging in tandem with plumbing updates in front of Massachusetts Hall. Through studying 19th-century maps of the Yard and performing a ground-penetrating radar survey, professors discovered that the foundations of the Indian College founded by a charter in 1655 lay underneath Matthews Hall. Professor Christina Hodge describes the course as “an unusual kind of course at Harvard. There aren’t that many courses where students literally have their hands in the dirt.”The small but well-edited collection in the Peabody Museum explores three aspects of life at 17th-century Harvard: negotiations of social status, rule breaking and religion, and literacy and the Indian College. Artifacts related to the serving and eating of food provide evidence of social tensions. Shards of dishes and tableware point to officially mandated classism; wealthy students paid double the normal tuition, and in return ate delicacies such as fruit on tables set with dishes, tablecloths, silver, and pewter, while the other students ate off of wooden trenchers. Although Harvard abided by a number of Puritan-inspired rules, students found pieces of pipes, mugs, and wine bottles that denoted a tradition of openly flouting the rules. “It’s pretty much all we find,” says head teaching fellow Michele Koons. “There’s more [drinking and smoking] paraphernalia than in some tavern sites.”Perhaps the most impressive finds, though, were the fragments of moveable type from the first printing press in North America—the one housed in the Indian College. The small strips of metal that students uncovered actually played an important role in the development of American print culture. The Eliot Bible, the first published work in North America, was produced on the Indian College press in the local Algonquian language.“Digging Veritas” represents not only the physical excavations from multiple digs, but also the effects of years of cooperation between students, teachers, the public, and the original stakeholders in Harvard College—the local Native Americans, specifically the Wampanoag tribe. An overarching theme of the course, besides offering tangible archaeology experience, is to facilitate a discourse with the local Native Americans who had been ignored for 300 years. Although the 1655 charter of Harvard College stated its goal was “the education of the English and Indian Youth of this Country in knowledge: and godliness,” it was only after the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act that federal funds supported the long process of ethnographic repatriation. “This exhibit represents not only what students saw as important, but also what natives wanted to emphasize,” says Koons. This attention to the importance of the Indian legacy at Harvard is a vital part of the exhibition. Professor Hodge notes that, despite troubling episodes of classism and racism in Harvard’s history, “It was really a place where different people were coming together, a belief which we still try to perpetuate.”

Under the new artistic direction of Diane Paulus, the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) is in for a massive rehaul. Forget about just breaking the fourth wall: Paulus is determined to conceive of the whole world as a stage, with audience members getting in on the play.
The focus of her plans, as expressed in “Experience the A.R.T.”—Paulus’ initiative—is to restructure the experience of theater to facilitate active spectator involvement in and out of the theater building. According to Paulus, viewers should not only enjoy the show as audience members, but also be able to take advantage of opportunities to dine, socialize, and perform with the artists.
“As a director, my driving source of inspiration is the audience. Theater is more than simply a play on the stage; it’s a ritual, a social occasion for people to come together and experience community,” Paulus wrote in her inaugural address as Artistic Director. The organization of the current season’s schedule attests to an emphasis on encouraging dynamic interchange between the performer and spectator.
The A.R.T. seeks to overcome the traditional stereotype of musicals and plays as one-sided, self-contained experiences. Instead, productions will be arranged into festivals, with multiple shows connected by one broad theme. The first festival, “Shakespeare Exploded,” features the Paulus-directed “The Donkey Show” as its premiere production. “The Donkey Show,” a simultaneous musical and dance party, gives audiences an idea of how the A.R.T. seeks to transform all of its shows into more accessible cultural spectacles.
Paulus, who has spearheaded this endeavor to blur the divide between the audience and the actors, is leading the A.R.T. with considerable expertise from her directorial background in theater and opera. Just this past year, she successfully revived an on-Broadway production of “Hair.”
“It’s been thrilling to have this opportunity to lead an organization as a producer as well as a director,” she says. “I’ve directed shows before, but to be able to shape the bigger picture of how theater is produced, how it is programmed, how we market it… I think these are things we have to think about holistically.”
With this all-encompassing scope, Paulus hopes to convince the Harvard community and others to reevaluate their perceptions of theater. According to Paulus, it is vitally important to make the A.R.T. a vibrant and central part of the arts at Harvard.
“It’s not just paying attention to the art piece. It’s also thinking about how to reach students, how to make theater important again,” she says.Besides focusing on the performance elements of the A.R.T., Paulus has recognized that the theater must consider the economic situation as it implements changes to its mission.
“We can’t separate art from business anymore, but we have to think in a very integrated way about what theater is and how we are most effective,” Paulus says.  In some ways the current economic climate has even provided the necessary catalyst to initiate the A.R.T.’s venture into expanding the boundaries of theater.
“I think the [economic] crisis is a call to arms [because] you can’t do business in the same way anymore,” Paulus says. “It makes you think about how to make the most out of what you’ve got and not to be complacent about resources. It’s no question that it’s a difficult time, but I try to look at the opportunity within this economic moment and learn from it.”
The reach of the A.R.T.’s expansion project will even bypass the stage and the community, and extend into the classroom to reestablish closer ties to Harvard College. Paulus will co-teach a new course this fall with English professor and Shakespeare scholar Marjorie Garber. The class, “Theater, Dream, Shakespeare,” relates directly to the company’s performance season.
“I was excited about the breadth of opportunity here. You are not just running a theater—you are on a campus, you are a part of student life, you are in a city with all these college kids,” Paulus says. “I always thought there was great potential energy here.”

Newly elected Cambridge Public Schools superintendent, Jeffrey M. Young, said that he would not be able to provide concrete recommendations to remedy the long-debated “middle school issue” in the city by the October deadline set by the school committee.Young, who began working for the district on July 6, had agreed to present to the committee his plan to resolve the concern over the quality of the education that 6th-8th grade students receive in K-8 schools, an environment some claim is not specifically—and therefore poorly—designed for the needs of early adolescence.Young told the Boston Globe that he will delay making specific recommendations—which he had promised to deliver 100 days after taking office—because he did not have sufficient time to review the issue, as schools have been closed for the summer.For decades the community has been debating the state of middle school education in the district. The city has no middle schools, but rather one K-6 school and eleven that are K-8, which feed into a single high school.The school committee was in the process of addressing the issue last year under the direction of former superintendent Thomas D. Fowler-Finn, but was interrupted when he “went to pursue other interests,” in the words of School Committee member Joseph G. Grassi. In the wake of Fowler-Finn’s departure, the school committee was considering candidates for the superintendency that would be particularly adroit at handling the middle school issue.“We voted on the 100 days deadline because we as a group believe that this is an important issue that must be addressed,” said school committee member Nancy Tauber. “We wanted [the new superintendent] to know this issue was a priority.”Grassi went so far as to identify the concern as “the biggest issue the school committee is going to have over the next term.”While Young will not provide concrete recommendations, he will be presenting a general plan to the school committee on September 22nd.“My understanding is he’s going to present recommendations in terms of the process and how he’s going to proceed,” Grassi said. School committee members said they were not displeased by the delay.“I don’t think of it as a push-back,” Tauber said. “I thank that it is just thoughtful governance. I think it’s important for him to spend time in schools talking to teachers, talking to families, and talking to his administration.”—Staff writer Sofia E.

Due to budget cuts, Harvard’s Language Resource Center will no longer offer students free memberships to Rosetta Stone, a self-study language computer program.Year-long subscriptions to the program, which had been available free of charge exclusively to students for the past two years, will now be available to both students and staff for $110, 20 percent of the $539 market price.According to Associate Dean Robert G. Doyle, free access to Rosetta Stone had not previously been available to staff because funding only covered students. The LRC had been willing to pay full price for the second year of subscription for student access, but because of the 15 percent FAS-wide budget cut, the service had to be terminated.  Of the 50 discounted subscriptions purchased so far, three have been purchased by students. Doyle said that if too few memberships are purchased, the program will have to be canceled because the LRC cannot afford to lose money.According to a survey conducted at the end of the ’08-’09 academic year, 105 of the 379 students who signed up to use Rosetta Stone logged in more than one hour per week. Doyle said that primary use for the program seemed to stem from graduate students who needed to refresh their memories in order to prepare for their Ph.D foreign language exams. Undergraduates said they were interested in using Rosetta Stone to practice languages for travel. Marino F. Auffant ’10 was one of those students. Auffant signed up for Rosetta Stone’s Korean program because he was going to be traveling to Korea over the summer and wanted to review what he’d learned before and during freshman year. Although he said that he would recommend the program to those interested in being introduced to a new language, he added that “it was helpful, but only at an elementary level.” On the other hand, Rebecca K. Gilmore ’12 said she thought the program was effective. She said it was a great program, especially for those with enough dedication to log in on a weekly basis.Gilmore took Italian through Rosetta Stone because her undergraduate course schedule would not allow her to take any more languages. Though she said she understands why the funding for free access to Rosetta Stone had to be cut, she said that she “would like to be able to think that when things have stabilized, even if it’s after I’ve graduated, they’ll bring it back.”—Staff Writer Beverly Pozuelos can be reached at pozuelos@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard University Health Services has identified 38 unoccupied dorm rooms throughout the House system to isolate students who have the H1N1 “swine” flu and do not have single bedrooms.
Two sick students will be placed in each of these bedrooms if needed, and Harvard University Dining Services will deliver meals to the rooms while the students are in isolation, according to UHS director David S. Rosenthal ’59.
These bedrooms have not been used yet because Stillman Infirmary has a capacity of 15 people and is not full, Rosenthal said.
Since August 26, 49 people have gone to UHS with influenza-like illnesses, the vast majority of whom were undergraduates, Rosenthal said.
College students with single bedrooms—roughly one-third of students on campus have singles—have been sent back to their rooms to recover. They have been given masks to wear for when they use common bathrooms, and their food has been delivered to their bedrooms by HUDS. Undergraduates from within two to three hours of campus have been sent home to recover.
“The resident deans are in good communication with [Ad Board Secretary Jay L. Ellison], the deans, and UHS,” said Lisa Boes, resident dean of Pforzheimer House. 
Flu symptoms are called influenza-like illnesses because Massachusetts is no longer testing for the H1N1 flu versus the seasonal flu, but the recent cases are almost certainly H1N1 flu.
“There’s almost no seasonal flu that’s been detected in the last month or so,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. 
UHS gives digital thermometers, masks, tissues, and Purell dispensers to people who exhibit flu-like symptoms. Students can leave isolation after 24 hours without a fever, which usually takes three to four days, Rosenthal said.
Lipsitch said the UHS flu procedures for isolating students were exceptionally cautious.
“The best expectations are that it’s going to be a mild illness in most people, so I think that’s a pretty conservative thing to do,” Lipsitch said.
Rosenthal recommends that everyone receive the seasonal flu vaccine. UHS ordered 150 percent more seasonal flu vaccines this year and has already administered seasonal flu vaccinations to almost 1,000 people, including over 300 freshmen.
But the H1N1 flu vaccine is not yet ready. Lipsitch estimates that a small number of doses will be ready in October, but most of these vaccinations will be reserved for high-risk groups.
UHS has a list of about 500 people within the University who are high-risk, not including pregnant women, Rosenthal said. This list includes undergraduates with chronic illnesses who have reported to UHS.
Lipsitch said that the H1N1 vaccine might be widely available by December or January, but he estimates that the number of people with the flu will peak in October or November.
HUDS has also been enacting policies to prevent the flu from spreading in dining halls, according to an e-mailed statement released by HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin. Martin could not be reached by phone for comment.
These policies have included installing hand sanitizers, posting signs with hygiene tips, changing service spoons frequently, and wiping down commonly touched services.

In an effort to streamline the University’s communication costs, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith has eliminated the FAS communications office and transferred its former director Robert P. Mitchell to the newly created post of FAS diversity dean, which has yet to see clearly defined responsibilities.The FAS communications office will be merged into the Harvard public affairs and communications office, with specific individuals charged with handling FAS, Smith wrote in an e-mailed statement. All information requests, media inquiries, and press releases pertaining to FAS—Mitchell’s former domain—will now fall under the purview of the University’s senior director of communications, John Longbrake.Mitchell, who works on the FAS Diversity Committee, said he will act as the primary communications vehicle for individuals whose work involves student, faculty, and staff diversity.According to Smith, Mitchell has already started his duties as assistant dean for diversity relations and communications—a post that had been in the works for “several months.” But Mitchell said in an interview yesterday that he has yet to comprehensively draft his goals as diversity dean, emphasizing his desire to meet with key individuals first.“It’s not a position that does programs,” said Mitchell, who serves as co-chair of the Harvard Association of Black Faculty, Administrators and Fellows. “I hope that I can help [the administrators] better communicate what they do.” FAS communications, which separated from the University news office ten years ago, is now returning to its former home, according to Longbrake. The merging will likely save costs, such as the lease for the FAS communication office’s space on Bow Street, he added.Though Smith has noted the cost-effective aspect of the merging, FAS will continue to pay for the salaries of Mitchell and his two former staff workers—assistant director of communications Stephen Bradt and communications specialist Amy A. Lavoie, who now report to Longbrake. It has not been decided whether Bradt and Lavoie’s salaries will be paid for by the University rather than FAS after the current transition phase, according to Longbrake.Mitchell said he has met with students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and plans to meet with Senior Adviser on Faculty Development and Diversity Michele Lamont, Assistant Dean for Human Resources Andrea L.

Hammonds—who served as provost for faculty development and diversity before assuming her current role.“His years of experience at the University, his strong commitment to the cause of diversity, and his expertise in communications position him to be a strong ally in the years ahead,” Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer wrote in an e-mailed statement about Mitchell’s appointment.“I think having more resources of this type is just extremely, extremely important,” said sociology professor Lamont, who added that she hopes FAS will recruit and tenure more women and minorities. “It’s not just about racial diversity; it’s about cosmopolitanism and the range of realities that our faculty have experience in as human beings.”Mitchell worked as communications director at Brandeis University, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Hahnemann University, and also served as an adjunct professor of public relations in the School of Journalism at Northeastern University before arriving at Harvard in August 2002 to assume the post of FAS communications director under then-FAS Dean William C. Kirby.—Staff writer Bonnie J. Kavoussi can be reached at kavoussi@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Esther I. Yi can be reached at estheryi@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two months after the University implemented sweeping workforce reductions, union officials remain optimistic that the over 100 laid-off staffers in the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers will be placed into open job positions elsewhere within the University.“Our official view at this point is, ‘So far, so good.’ Or maybe even a little better,” said HUCTW director Bill Jaeger. “The human resources community at the University is more aware than it’s ever been, and more thoughtful than we’ve ever seen, about really giving high priority to [laid-off employees] for open jobs.”He said that 32 laid off staff workers have already found new jobs at Harvard—an accomplishment he attributes to the Union’s strong work security program and productive collaboration with University administrators. He said that he could not say exactly how many unionized workers had been laid off in June, due to ambiguities such as voluntary layoffs and job offers with fewer hours, but that the figure fell somewhere between 100 and 130.Jaeger also said that in the late spring and summer, union officials noticed “a burst” of job postings at Harvard for union members. Whereas they might typically expect 10 to 15 new job posts a week during the spring, by June and July the number sometimes climbed to 30 to 40, Jaeger said. The ample number of available jobs and the union’s strong work security program bodes well for the remaining 70 to 100 laid-off union members still actively seeking Harvard jobs.“There’s a real reason to be optimistic,” Jaeger said, noting that as of Friday, there were 136 open job posted online available for union members. “Maybe it would be presumptuous to make a prediction, but we still think it’s possible for everybody who’s facing layoffs to be placed.”Jaeger conjectured that the upswing in job postings may be the result of delaying postings to provide a safety net for those who might later face layoffs.But when asked about the hiring spike, University spokesman Kevin Galvin pointed out that the number of jobs currently available at Harvard is 30 percent less than a year ago, and that Harvard hiring is cyclical and tends to be higher during the academic year. Galvin emphasized that laid off union workers will receive full pay and benefits through November, and that University case managers are continuing to aid affected employees in finding new jobs.Jason Gerdom, a HUCTW member laid off from the athletics department but who will soon assume a position in the development office, lauded his case manager, who critiqued Gerdom’s resume and arranged job interviews, Gerdom said. “You think of a lot of companies who say, ‘Don’t come into work tomorrow, we’ll mail you your check,’” he said. “For me, it was a process of, ‘Okay, we’ll help you get wrapped up, start meeting your case manager, and find you a new job.” —Staff writer Esther I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nobel Prize-winning biologist James D. Watson and Pulitzer Prize-winning Biology Professor Edward O. Wilson spoke in front of a nearly 1,000-person audience in Sanders Theatre yesterday, marking the 150th Anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species. 
The two modern-day scientific luminaries discussed their storied careers—including a once-intense professional rivalry—and reflected on the future of the biological sciences.
Watson, best known for his groundbreaking discovery of the structure of DNA, began his career as a student of zoology, but later switched to the budding field of genetic biology in the early 1950s, after finding ecology “not very intellectually demanding.”
Meanwhile, Wilson joined the Harvard faculty a year before Watson in 1955 in the Biology Department, and has since continued as a pioneer in the discipline, discovering scores of insect species over the course of his 60-year career.
The two famously butted heads during their concurrent 20-year tenures on the Harvard Faculty between 1956 and 1976.
Event moderator and NPR journalist Robert Krulwich did not shy away from the long-time rivalry between the two luminaries.
“They rarely spoke, and when they did it wasn’t exactly lovely. These two men not only challenged each other. Together, they have challenged the way we think about biology, and the way we think about living things,” Krulwich said. “Their once rather fierce rivalry has become a trusting friendship.”
Watson and Wilson had once exemplified the two polarized factions of the biological sciences. Watson focused much of his career on the molecular basis of life and Wilson studied the evolution and social behavior of ‘critters.’ 
The rivalry has lessened of late, both agreed, due in large part to the recent convergence of the two fields. 
“Molecular biology had a ‘bacterial’ explosion...and it produced a bunch of methods and ideas that [ecologists] started grabbing hold of,” Wilson said. “Meanwhile, MCB is starting to go evolutionary.”
Though now reformed rivals, Watson and Wilson did attest to the critical role of ambition and competition in making scientific advances. “You have to have an enemy,” Watson said.
Wilson admitted that he enjoys the thrill of the attack. During a controversial lecture on the biological basis for human nature in 1978 an audience member emptied a pitcher of water on Wilson’s head.
“I was the only scientist in modern times to be physically attacked for an idea.” Wilson said. “Take that Jim,” he added. 
As the discussion closed, Wilson addressed the complex challenges of the coming century, such as climate change and the loss of biodiversity. 
“We have Paleolithic emotions, Middle Age institutions, and god-like technologies and we will be facing a point of crisis in the coming decades,” Wilson said. “We have to answer huge questions of philosophy that philosophers abandoned decades ago—of who we are and where we come from rationally...or we are running a dangerous course.”

Brain Break began its fall late-night snack service on Tuesday in House dining halls and in Annenberg Hall, but the heavily promoted improvements left some students unimpressed.As one of the few Harvard programs receiving a budget increase in spite of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ $143 million budget shortfall, Brain Break was expected to feature “enhanced” choices—including healthier food options and greater variety.But the Tuesday night debut, featuring vanilla and chocolate cupcakes—along with traditional items such as bagels and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches—struck many undergraduates as nothing special.“I don’t feel like the variety has changed, but I feel like the quantity has doubled,” said Tri D. Chiem ’10 as he finished his apple in Quincy House. “I was hoping there would be something unique, but there wasn’t.”HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin said that the service was modified to improve uniformity across dining halls and increase day-to-day variety in food offerings.“It’s enhanced in that there are daily specials,” said Martin. “It also ensures that there is consistency House-to-House in everyday staples.”Brain Break is now on a schedule that repeats every two weeks. Offerings include cheese and crackers tonight, pita and hummus on Monday, and a brownie bar next Thursday. Basics like beverages, breads, condiments, fruit, and cereal will also be guaranteed in every dining hall. Still, this has not prevented some Houses from featuring special Brain Break events. Last night, Lowell House had an ice cream sundae bar as part of what the House Newsletter called a “Study Card Signing Event.”Many students have said that the enhanced Brain Break does not make up for the loss of hot breakfast, which was a casualty of the $77 million budget cuts FAS announced in May.“I am a huge fan of hot breakfast, and the fact that they took it away was very, very sad,” said Chris J. Loney ’11.In light of last night’s service, though, Emily M. Orlins ’11 said she was satisfied with the healthier offerings.“The last couple of days have been great,” she said. “Veggies are a high.”—Staff writer Naveen N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s invested endowment assets took a 27.3 percent hit this past fiscal year, amidst an economic maelstrom that Harvard Management Company CEO and President Jane L. Mendillo called “very likely the most challenging period in modern times for the financial markets as well as for the Harvard portfolio.” The decline brought the total value of the endowment as of June 30 down to $26 billion—on par with 2005 levels—after reaching almost $37 billion in 2008. The negative investment returns, combined with donations received and money paid out for operations, pushed the endowment’s total value down by $11 billion, or almost 30 percent.Despite the losses—which were more than the total endowments of any other schools except Yale, Princeton, and Stanford—Harvard’s endowment remains the largest in higher education. “[W]e saw extreme uncertainty in our economy and a level of volatility and dysfunction in many types of investments that went well beyond all previous experience,” wrote Mendillo, who took the helm at HMC only last summer. The decline—the largest ever experienced at HMC, which manages Harvard’s endowment—was not unexpected, and administrators have been planning for a 30 percent decline since December. Many peer institutions have been anticipating similar losses. The unprecedented drop has dramatic ramifications for Harvard’s schools, some of which rely on annual payments from the endowment for more than half their income. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University’s largest school and home of Harvard College, drew 52 percent of its revenues from the endowment last year. Planning for a precipitous drop in endowment size has already resulted in $77 million in budget cuts at FAS, and administrators are looking to cut another $143 million this year from a budget of just over $1 billion. Mendillo emphasized in the endowment report released Thursday that the portfolio is “well positioned” to seize on new investment opportunities and to support University operations. But the report also supplies telling details about the brutal losses sustained by HMC since last July—losses that in many cases exceeded those of standard benchmarks. Possible investment policy missteps that exacerbated the effects of the global financial crisis on HMC, such as the maintenance of an insufficient cash reserve, are mentioned prominently as well. Absolute return investments, which include some externally managed funds and made up 18 percent of the portfolio at the start of the last fiscal year, fell by 18.6 percent, or 5.4 percent more than the benchmark set by HMC’s board. The value of externally managed private equity holdings, representing 13 percent of the portfolio, dropped by a staggering 31.6 percent—nearly 8 percent more than the benchmark. “With a few notable exceptions, nearly every asset class did poorly,” Mendillo wrote. “While diversification has been a mainstay and a driver of the portfolio’s return over the long-term, the benefits of diversification did not bear out [in 2009].” The S&P 500 index fell roughly 28 percent during the period addressed by Mendillo’s letter, while peer investment groups as measured by the Trust Universe Comparison Service saw a softer median loss of 18.2 percent. As a whole, the endowment performed 2.1 percent worse than the Policy Portfolio—a theoretical portfolio set by HMC specifying allocations and setting performance goals among a mix of asset classes. But certain individual assets have performed well. The report noted that the value of Harvard’s real asset holdings fell by 37.7 percent—slightly less than the benchmark—and that internal emerging markets and international fixed income teams outperformed their benchmarks as well. As a result of this year’s broad underperformance, “a substantial number” of portfolio managers have had portions of their bonuses earned in past years “clawed back” by HMC, the report said, although it did not provide more specific figures. HMC, which has been criticized for its multi-million dollar compensation packages in the past, typically rewards managers for adding value and outperforming benchmarks. But it also withholds large portions of the bonuses over subsequent years in order to emphasize long-term growth and protect against excessive risk-taking. The report said that a small group of managers who outperformed markets would be receiving bonuses this year.Mendillo partly attributed the endowment’s underperformance to “complications” within the portfolio existing before the financial crisis, including “recent over-sized commitments to illiquid asset classes; within asset classes, a larger proportion of strategies with long holding periods; [and] a lack of ready liquidity in the portfolio to meet our obligations along with the needs of the University.” For years, Harvard has been the subject of scrutiny—and idolatry—as its endowment consistently generated double-digit yearly investment returns, largely due to its heavy exposure to alternative asset classes, which include real estate, private equity, timber, and other commodities. Such investments added long-term value to the endowment and brought sustained growth in previous years, but also reduced the portfolio’s liquidity—meaning that the University’s assets became more difficult to sell and convert to cash on short notice. When markets plummeted across the board last fall, Harvard, along with many other investors and peer institutions, sought to reduce exposure to those illiquid, alternative assets and instead boost cash reserves for operations. Private equity holdings are especially taxing since they often require ongoing and continued capital commitments from investors. “With perfect hindsight we and most other investors would have started this year in a more liquid position and with less exposure to some of the alternative asset categories that were hardest hit during FY 2009,” Mendillo wrote in the report. In November, media outlets began reporting that Harvard was looking to sell billions of dollars in private equity holdings at drastically reduced prices, and in December, the University sold $2.5 billion in bonds in order to raise cash, refinance short-term debt, and terminate certain investment agreements. (Mendillo has stated in the past that HMC began exploring private equity sales even before the financial world imploded, as part of a larger policy portfolio shift that she implemented upon her arrival.) Thursday’s endowment report said that over the past year, HMC has reduced its payments owed to outside investment firms by roughly $3 billion and raised cash in order to explore “attractive investment themes that we foresee emerging from the crisis.” Today, HMC’s Policy Portfolio aims to include a positive cash reserve of 2 percent, whereas the University had previously been borrowing a small percentage of additional money to invest—a practice that can augment gains but also magnify losses. Mendillo said that the Company is now also considering remodeling its portfolio to encourage team collaboration, focus more on internal strengths, and reassess the endowment’s risk and the University’s needs. While overall risk management was “adequate” last year and helped avoid extreme volatility, Mendillo wrote that more is being done now to manage risk and that lessons have been learned, particularly that “the risk tolerance of the University needs to be an integral factor” when determining how the endowment is invested.Nevertheless, HMC will likely hew to the diversified investment model that it has long championed. Mendillo pointed out that even slumping assets such as private equity have delivered high returns when annualized over the past few years. If HMC had simply invested its portfolio in a 60/40 ratio of stocks and bonds 10 years ago, the endowment today would be $18 billion smaller, she wrote.Mendillo also emphasized that HMC has taken steps this past year to increase flexibility and control over internal and external funds. The report said that she intends to continue using a “hybrid model” of internal and external managers, but that she is not targeting any specific proportion. Instead, she noted that internal management is highly cost effective and that HMC would look to “increase the share of our internally managed assets under the right conditions.” HMC cut its workforce by roughly 50 employees in February, citing the need to “re-balance and re-engineer” the organization. Since then, the Company has made a string of managerial hires, adding investment experts to several internal teams while appointing new heads of internal and external management from within. Mendillo said HMC has increased its “depth and breadth of talent” over the past year and will continue searching for further individuals with “unique investment insights.” These recent hires, along with the policy adjustments made over the past year increasing HMC’s liquidity, have laid the foundation for a “solid, innovative and sustainable investment strategy” that gives “ample cause for optimism” over the next few years, Mendillo wrote. But she also called for “realistic” performance expectations over the next several years. “For Harvard, as for almost every major investor, regaining the market value lost as a result of the recent global economic crisis will take time,” Mendillo wrote. —Staff writer Peter F.

The Harvard Kennedy School’s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy announced its slate of fall fellows earlier this week—a group of two journalists and two academics who will stay at Harvard to research issues confronting the modern press.The Shorenstein fellowship program, now in its twenty-fourth year, funds a semester-long term for experts in news media. Fellows are selected by a committee of the Shorenstein Center’s senior staff and Kennedy School faculty.This year’s fellows are John G. Geer, a Vanderbilt professor and an expert on political attack ads; Loen Kelley, a television producer who has worked with CBS, CNN, and CNBC; Bill Mitchell, a faculty member at the Poynter Institute who studies the evolving economics of news; and Steve Williams, executive editor for the BBC’s Asia Pacific channels.In addition, Daniel Okrent, the first public editor of the New York Times, will be serving as the visiting Edward R. Murrow lecturer. Okrent, previously a Shorenstein fellow and an associate with the center, will teach a class on writing and reporting politics.Alex S. Jones, director of the center, said he thought this year’s class of fellows was particularly well-suited to address the polarized nature of modern political discourse.“We’re in an even more partisan, poisonous environment than we ever have been,” said Jones, who pointed to the health-care debate as a particularly striking current example. “With these fellows, we feel like we’re right on the tip of the arrow.” Geer, whose research will focus on how news media coverage actually augments negative campaign advertising, said he was excited to interact with members of the Harvard community and to immerse himself in Cambridge life.“Academics and political scientists like me tend to keep ourselves in ivory towers and not interact with practitioners,” Geer said. “I’ve got a lot of data I want to present here to the community, so that would give me the chance to ask people if these results square with their own experiences and their own intuitions, and if not, I want to know why.” Kelly said she was particularly thrilled about the prospect of engaging with the Harvard community beyond her own research.“The whole University is available on all levels of faculty and students and all the events going on, and it’s just a rare opportunity to be exposed to so many exciting people and interesting issues and topics and events,” Kelly said.­—Staff writer Evan T.R.

After a dormant period, the Standing Committee on Ethnic Studies is meeting again, boasting increased faculty participation, a book of courses, and a pair of visiting professors, while looking ahead to the creation of a General Education portal course and even a secondary field.Until this past spring, the Standing Committee had not met for at least two years, said current committee chair and Professor of English and African and African American Studies Werner Sollors.In the past few decades, faculty bodies coordinating ethnic studies have shifted from ad hoc to standing committees. In multiple instances, students have organized to demand more academic options. The last big student push was in 2002, when a coalition failed to win approval for a certificate in ethnic studies. The committee’s current revival has come in response to interest from the Undergraduate Council and the Ethnic Studies Coalition, an unofficial student group that formed last spring to advocate for the subject’s revitalization. Various faculty members, over 20 of whom now sit on the committee, also supported the effort.The Standing Committee’s input contributed to the hiring of two visiting faculty—Hua H. Hsu in English and Denise Khor in history—who are teaching courses related to ethnic studies this year. Sollors said he hopes to work within financial constraints to recruit more visiting faculty in future years.Sollors and his colleagues want to focus on teaching ethnicity, migration,  indigeneity, and human rights, he said, adding that the many strands of ethnic studies are best taught in an interdisciplinary setting. “In African and African American Studies, people from many different disciplines cross the boundary between social sciences and humanities, and that is really ideal for an ethnic studies unit as well,” he said.The committee is hoping to win approval for a secondary field in ethnic studies and a related citation in human rights.But before the committee can offer a secondary field, it must create an introductory course. English Professor Joanne van der Woude has submitted a proposal for such a course that would serve as a portal into the ethnic studies field and could be included in the General Education curriculum.Van der Woude said that because Harvard lacks programs on Asian Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans, she plans to focus on the stories of those groups in American history. Her syllabus includes Phillis Wheatley, Junot Diaz, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She said that she hopes the course will be approved in time for the next academic year, and that a secondary field in ethnic studies will follow soon.The secondary field would match the General Education curriculum’s emphasis on civic engagement, van der Woude said. “Ethnic studies is intimately connected with that because it takes up the writings of those who have been frequently displaced and dispossessed,” she said.Sollors said that the secondary field proposal is being developed, and that he could not say when it might be submitted. Van der Woude said that professors are currently discussing how best to advise students and integrate human rights into an ethnic studies field.Undergraduate Council President Andrea R. Flores ’10, whose campaign platform last fall included a promise to push for ethnic studies, said that she hopes to finalize the details of the secondary field before her term concludes at the end of this semester. She said that the issue of ethnic studies became important to her because social science concentrations like history were not focused on racial diversity, leaving to the wayside subjects like Chicano history and Asian American history.Ethnic Studies Coalition co-director Athena L.M. Lao ’12 said she hopes the secondary field will be in place by the time she graduates in 2012. “There are a lot of universities with really good ethnic studies programs,” she said. “I have trouble seeing Harvard as being the best university in the world when it’s lagging in something like ethnic studies.”Besides offering new academic options, the students and faculty involved in the ethnic studies push are planning to organize a conference to be held this spring that they hope will appeal to a broad audience beyond the committee, Lao said.—Staff writer Manning Ding can be reached at ding3@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Alex M.

As the College looks to juggle the transition between its old Core curriculum and the new General Education program meant to replace it, the Gen Ed office has been accommodating dozens of drop-in visits and around 200 e-mails a day—including a surprising number from upperclassmen for whom the program is not mandatory. The rush seems to go beyond the normal “beginning-of-term insanity,” according to Stephanie H. Kenen, administrative director of the program in General Education. Administrators had not anticipated the number of juniors and seniors who have shown interest in graduating under Gen Ed in an attempt to gain greater flexibility in their scheduling.Given that all new Gen Ed classes have been engineered to fulfill a Core requirement, and that the 2008-2009 Harvard Student Handbook recommends that the Classes of 2010 and 2011 opt for the Core, more students had been expected to stick with the older program.But several students interviewed by The Crimson this week say that switching to the Gen Ed system allows them to shed requirements that they would otherwise be required to fulfill if they stayed in the Core.  Fathima F. Jahufar ’11, a Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator, went from six required classes under the Core to three required classes under the Gen Ed scheme.“I’ve only taken one Core class,” she said. “I’m just really happy [Gen Ed] exists.”Although she did not yet have concrete data, Kenen suggested that many junior and seniors in the sciences have found switching to Gen Ed particularly advantageous. Several introductory science and pre-med classes—such as Life Sciences 1a: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences” and Math 1b: “Calculus, Series, and Differential Equations”—that previously did not count towards Core credit for science concentrators now can fulfill Gen Ed requirements for those concentrators.But Anne Marie E. Calareso, program manager for General Education, was quick to caution that the Gen Ed office is not strictly focused on finding students the curricular path with the least number of requirements.“Each conversation is tailored to that individual student’s interests,” she said. Despite the evident trend, the Gen Ed office will be unable to estimate exactly how many juniors and seniors are making the switch until October 15 at the earliest, said Kenen. On that date, the registrar plans to offer an online tool allowing students who have declared their concentration to officially choose between the Core and Gen Ed.In hopes of better educating students about the differences between the two curricular programs, the Gen Ed office plans to hold an information session open to all students sometime around the planned release of the online tool on October 15, Kenen said.—Staff writer Benjamin M.

Every varsity athlete’s dream of receiving a free DHA sweat suit may become another victim of the stagnant economy and the Harvard Department of Athletics’ budget cuts. It was customary for varsity athletes to receive the complementary sweat suit every year as a testament to their athletic prowess, but this year there will be no handouts. Following recent trends, Harvard’s Department of Athletics has made considerable reductions to its budget, which in turn has affected how much each team can spend on equipment. The department asked all varsity coaches to budget only what was necessary to their program. Whether the DHA sweaters were budgeted depended on each team’s allowance as well as the coach’s opinion on the matter. “The DHA sweat suits were always available as part of the training gear for different sports,” said Senior Associate Director of Athletics Patricia Henry. “When we made certain decisions in reducing our budgets, we gave budget targets to the coaches and it was to their discretion to decide what they needed to outfit their teams.” Since the sweat suits were not budgeted, varsity athletes will not be able to obtain them from the department free of cost–or at all for some athletes. “The sweat suits are not for sale,” Henry said. “There has been some misleading information going around but it is not true. We may look into selling sweat suits if there is high demand for them in the future, but for now we are not selling them.” Some varsity athletes were not pleased that certain individuals will receive the gear and others won’t despite an understanding of the grim economic situation. “Athletes who don’t get the sweaters should be able to pay for them at a reasonable price,” said women’s water polo co-captain Kelly Peeler. “I don’t see the harm in selling them to us at the normal prices they would get it for. In terms of the culture, DHA sweaters are important, but it’s understandable if cuts have to be made.” Another recent athletic concern pertained to the department’s policies regarding undergraduate students and their gym memberships.The misconception involved the idea that undergraduates needed to reactivate their gym memberships online to continue having free access to the university’s gyms and classes. “There are no fees for using the university’s gym facilities,” said Associate Director of Athletics Jeremy Gibson. “We haven’t gone through any changes regarding that and the gyms are still available to students free of charge.” When asked about the website allowing students to renew their memberships, Gibson elucidated that the purpose of the website was for “catching information for classes and making sure that they aren’t overbooked.” The reduced budget, however, has affected the open hours of many facilities in as part of the cutback on operation costs. “We’re closing some of our facilities for more hours than in the past but no additional charges,” Henry said. “We had to make significant reduction in our department and we took it very seriously. We did what we had to do.”—Staff writer Brian A. Campos can be reached at bcampos@fas.harvard.edu.

Just one week into the season, the Harvard men’s soccer team seems to be walking on sunshine.The Crimson men are riding high on a two-game winning streak, defeating each of their opponents by at least a two-goal margin. Add to this a new class of rookie standouts, a record-setting point performance by co-captain Andre Akpan, and an impressive .207 successful shot percentage relative to its opponents’ .032 mark, and Harvard (2-0-0) seems to have found the recipe to success.However, as biting autumn winds drift through the leaves of Harvard Yard, the Crimson’s stay in the sun is about to be challenged. This coming weekend, both No. 14 Boston University and Army will step onto Ohiri Field in an attempt to stifle Harvard’s burgeoning momentum.The Crimson’s first game of the weekend will undoubtedly be its most important of the non-conference season.The cross-city rival Terriers (2-0-1) are not only ranked among the best teams in the nation but are also hoping to prolong their own two-game winning streak.“It’s one of those games that’s really going to determine our season,” Akpan said. “A win over [BU] will put us in the national spotlight and it’ll really get our season going.”The threat is clear. The Terriers recently delivered a 3-0 upset to No. 12 Connecticut last Saturday. And, like Harvard, BU has posted a shooting percentage more than six times better than its opponents.Of particular threat is junior Aaron O’Neal, who has tallied a team-leading four of the Terriers’ seven goals.Even more nerve-racking than BU’s recent accomplishments may be the complete destruction that ensued at the two teams’ last meeting. After less than five minutes of play, BU delivered its first blow to Harvard and went on to massacre the visiting Crimson, 5-1. Harvard’s lone goal resulted from the work of its current co-captains–Akpan headed in classmate Brian Grimm’s free kick early in the first period.“[BU] beat us pretty badly last year, so they’ll be an element of trying to get a little bit of revenge,” Harvard Coach Jamie Clark said. “That will be the biggest game of our early part of the season—BU is the top team in the Northeast right now.”However, the Crimson will have to do more this weekend than face a daunting top-15 foe.On Sunday, the men will once again don their crimson and white to take on the Black Knights of Army.The black and gold faithful present a far less intimidating set of statistics than this afternoon’s visitors. Army holds a 1-2 record for the season, falling 0-1 in both of its last two matchups against Manhattan and then Marist.Also, the Black Knights have also only scored two goals thus far in the season.“Army will be the business end of that weekend,” Clark said.While still maturing, the Crimson has incorporated both underclassmen and upperclassmen in its game plan, but improvements must still be made.“We just need to keep getting a little bit better across the board,” Clark said. “We do well, but at the same time we’re still giving up a few too many chances.”Opponents have out-shot the Crimson 31-29, a risky statistic when considering the talents of BU and O’Neal. However, senior Desomond Mitchell, who holds one of Harvard six goals this season, is confident in his team’s ability to keep growing as they face increasingly heated contests.“Our team’s getting better and better every game,” Mitchell said. “We’re hoping to keep developing.”The Crimson will have the opportunity to develop as well as a chance at redemption against the Terriers at 4:00 this afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a team looking to find its stride after a difficult opening weekend, the ideal schedule would be a slate of easy contests to build up confidence. Unfortunately for Harvard men’s water polo, the squad doesn’t have that luxury.The Crimson (0-3) will travel to Denunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J. this weekend hoping to establish itself at the Princeton Invitational after three straight losses to open the season.But Harvard will have a tremendously talented field—including five teams in the Collegiate Water Polo Association preseason top 20—standing in its way. As the Crimson prepares for match-ups with No. 11 Princeton, No. 16 Santa Clara, George Washington, and Northern Division foe Fordham, the team knows it faces a challenge, but welcomes the test.“Our team is very fired up for all four of these games,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar said. “We’ve got four great games and we’re playing all of them to win.”In order to do so, the Crimson must revamp its offense, which struggled last weekend.In particular, players cited a lack of variety in the Harvard attack, but Farrar insisted that issue is in the past.“It’s a natural part of the process [that] early in the season you’re putting things in along the way,” Farrar said. “We’ve…added additional options on offense that should make it more effective.”Any offensive wrinkles the Crimson introduces will likely hinge on junior co-captain Bret Voith, who has emerged as the squad’s preeminent scoring threat. Voith enjoyed a breakout season in 2008—earning the “Coaches’ Award”—and has continued to look sharp this season, as he leads the team with four goals. But the co-captain has worked to do more than put the ball in the net, making it a personal goal to help Harvard reassert its team identity.“I’m looking to reestablish who we are in the conference and who we are as a team,” Voith said. “Playing these high-level teams, the key is proving to ourselves that we can play with them and that we can be one of those teams.”For the Crimson to achieve its goals, perhaps no contest is more important than the Saturday match-up with the Rams of Fordham, who bested Harvard twice last season by scores of 14-6 and 10-8 and created a considerable rivalry in the process.“If I had to pick one game to blow somebody out this weekend, it would be Fordham,” co-captain Egen Atkinson said. “They left me with a bad taste after last year and I think everyone on the team shares that sentiment.”While the Rams (1-3) represent an important test for the Crimson to gauge its competitiveness within the division, the team will not overlook its other games against quality opponents. Before taking on Fordham and Santa Clara on Saturday, Harvard will face Friday contests against the Colonials (2-2) and the Tigers (0-0), both of whom represent conference playoff contenders.“It’s always fun to play Southern Division teams like GW and Ivy-rival Princeton,” Farrar said. “It brings out the best in both squads and I’m looking forward to great competition. These teams are stones on which we can sharpen our edge.”The head coach also noted that Harvard may have more than one axe to grind this weekend, adding, “The last time we played GW they defeated us for third in the Eastern Championships, and we’d like to return the favor.”With emotions running high, the Crimson will rely on its veterans to maintain composure in the pool. Atkinson and junior Jeff Lee have provided a strong presence on offense, tallying three goals apiece last weekend, while senior Nikhil Balaraman has been steady in goal.Balaraman and sophomore Alex Popp have proven to be a bright spot for Harvard between the pipes, averaging over seven saves per contest. But the pair will have to be on its game throughout the tournament, as the Crimson expects to see a barrage of different offensive attacks—particularly from a Princeton team that has yet to compete in 2009.“We’ll see a lot of different things this weekend, because the teams we play have different styles,” Atkinson explained. “Princeton has some specific plays that work well for them and GW runs a very mobile offense, so we’ll get experience…which will be valuable down the stretch once divisional play begins.”Harvard knows that this experience may come at a price, as powerhouse teams at the invitational could deal disheartening blows to the emerging squad. But with a new offensive scheme and a strong pair of goalies, Harvard could be successful if the team channels the emotion of its rivalries into disciplined competition.“[Our opponents] are all strong teams, but there are definitely some teams we can beat,” Farrar said. “Whoever makes the fewest mistakes is going to win.”If the Crimson can work its way to a couple of victories, the squad will have taken the first meaningful step towards establishing its identity.“[In the past] we haven’t proven that we’re one of those [elite] teams,” Voith said. “But that’s what we want to do, starting this weekend.”—Staff writer Max N.

To the millions of pre-admits, pre-admit families, and kindergarten hopefuls, Dean of Admissions William R Fitzsimmons’ word is gold—gold that will be gracing the pages of The New York Times college admissions blog, The Choice, from September 10-15. Readers are invited to post questions for Fitzsimmons of which (and mind you the posts will likely hit 1,000 before Flyby finishes writing this post) he will answer 2-3 per day.
Fitzsimmons said he immediately agreed when his long time acquaintance at the NYT, Jacques Steinberg, proposed the idea two weeks ago.
“It is an opportunity to reach out, what you want to do as an admissions officer is serve the public interest…it also would allow us to answer some of the questions most on people’s minds and  try to demystify and demythologize so many urban legends about admissions,” Fitzsimmons told Flyby.
In our own attempt to help the dean sift through the pages and pages and pages of questions, Flyby chose a few we found most relevant or all-encompassing.
Read after the jump for a little preview.
FlyBy: Here’s a good one, one guy asked why the cost of higher education now outpaces the standard of living…
William R. Fitzsimmons: The average household doesn’t have to conduct cutting edge research in labs that cost millions of dollars to run…[for one thing]… there are lots of reasons, that’s one [question] we will take some time to answer.
FB: This one’s more straightforward: Will Harvard ever reinstate transfer admissions?
WRF: Your guess is as good as mine on that one.
FB: Hmm, this one seems relevant. This person asks about your thoughts on the “industry of admissions consultants.”
WRF: This is an industry that has been growing over the past 5-10 years in part because there are less resources available to students in high schools…there are schools in which there are ratios of nearly 1000 to 1 counselees to counselor…in this crisis situation there has certainly been an industry that has grown to meet this unmet need… (WRF noted that many consultants, finding themselves in situations where they are disproportionately helping already advantaged students, have begun to do pro-bono work as well.)
FB: Okay you’re probably not going to love this one, “Can you comment on the admissions preference given to legacy students, athletes, and minorities?”Flyby broke this question down a bit… (We were specifically interested in how Harvard has been nabbing so many all-star athletes lately…)
WRF: We prize excellence of all kinds… part of the American college experience is athletics; it’s a form of excellence. In many communities students can’t afford a cello [for example] but have sports programs… We have the largest number of intercollegiate sports – it has been a way to reach out to students who would not have been able to come to Harvard otherwise, if you look at student athletes later in life it’s amazing what they have done.
Case in point: WRF played goalie for Harvard’s Men’s Hockey from ’64-’67.

In celebration of the auspicious occasion on which you contractually obligate the next 12 weeks of your life to this venerable institution, FlyBy has dug up the dirt on the man who makes it all possible: Barry S. Kane.
Harvard's international man of mystery, Kane came to be the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' registrar, from the ivory dungeon that is our arch rival: Yale University. Then and now he was rarely seen, but often heard.
You've probably gotten at least one email from this legend of the Ivies--shaming you into filling out that last Q guide evaluation form or threatening to slap you with a hefty $50 late registration fee if you try to squeeze in one last day out of your summer vacay.
But for those of you who are dying of curiosity, FlyBy is here to help. As the Yale Herald once wrote in 2003, "You may not know his face, but he has one of the most famous names on campus." We've dug up a dusty portrait of the handsome gent after the jump.

If only we had known that Mr. Kane rose to prominence in Yale's registrar's office by spearheading its transition to the then-unknown "interweb," we would have been able to predict the inevitable disappearance of the Tolstoy-sized course catalog that we've enjoyed for so long. Kane piloted a move to online course selection at Yale before doing the same at Harvard.
Fun fact: Mr. Kane is also lifelong singer and pianist.
Now, if we turn in our study cards on time today, can we request a song?

New and Improved Brain Break® began at Harvard this week, and FlyBy couldn’t wait to try it out. The thought of new, nutritious options to end our second-to-last day of shopping was irresistible—well, at least, until we got there.
From cupcakes with frosting in Annenberg to apple pie in Quincy, FlyBy couldn’t help but think that New and Improved Brain Break® looked eerily familiar. So we asked some of our fellow late-night diners what they thought.
Jennifer C. Francisco ’10, spotted in Eliot
 
On Eliot’s normal fare: “Typically, Eliot’s Brain Breaks aren’t very good, so I’m not very surprised.”
 On the cupcakes: “They were good. They reminded me of Annenberg Brain Breaks.”
On what was missing: “There’s no hemp plus granola. That kinda makes me sad, but you gotta appreciate what you have.”
 FlyBy’s response: Good attitude, Jen. Appreciating what you have, that’s what it’s all about.
More after the jump...
Jeff L. Hall ’11, spotted in Annenberg eating a slice of Papa John’s pepperoni pizza.
 
His most notable memory of Brain Break: “I remember once last year they had a bunch of cheesecakes, like 30 cheesecakes.”
 The likelihood it will happen again: “Nah, I think that was a fluke.”
 On his pizza: “It’s good.”
Chris J. Loney ’11, spotted in Quincy eating an apple.
 
On breakfast: “I am a huge fan of hot breakfast, and the fact that they took it away was very, very sad.”
 On what he ate: “I had an apple, along with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on wheat bread.”
 On what he wanted at Brain Break: “Grapes. I like grapes. I’ve never seen grapes at a Brain Break before.”
Keren E. Rohe ’13, spotted in Annenberg eating Fruit Loops
 
On what was served: “That half of the dining kitchen was blocked off so I couldn’t get to the cereal I wanted. I really wanted the Crackle and Oat Bran, and it was on the other side and I was sad.”
 On what she wanted at Brain Break: “I would want them to bring in a servant to do my homework. I have 140 pages of reading to do for class.”
 FlyBy’s response: Welcome to Harvard.

Returning to fair Harvard in September can mean a lot of things:  the chance to take new classes, see old friends, and enjoy Cambridge without a permanent layer of snow on the ground.
It can mean back to school shopping for some...and back to school stealing for others—and there's the rub.
You might have been one of the lucky contingent of back-to-schoolers who successfully recovered their refrigerators, chairs and futons from House storage areas without a hitch (barring, perhaps, a little lower back pain). Some others...not so much.
House lists have been flooded with complaints of lost, stolen, or misplaced items—along with the more optimistic bunch hoping that maybe someone just took their entire futon from the depths of storage... by accident.
More after the jump.
Then there's a third group, who eagerly offer amnesty to contrite storage robbers. One individual, who shall remain nameless, wrote to the Currier houselist, wrote, "P.P.S. - anonymous drop offs of my M.I.A items may be delivered to [redacted]......if you wish to remain shrouded in mystery."
One Mather House resident offered to help out one of the pilferers and give whoever swiped his chair the arm rests they left behind.
"[H]onestly, even if you took my chair (armless) you can have the arms -- I was gonna sell it for $5 anyway," he wrote.
Another good samaritan had secont thoughts after claiming a whiteboard that had been left outside of storage along with some other items.
I was walking along in the B entryway basement hallway going to the computer lab, and randomly saw a desk, mattress frame and whiteboard leaned against the wall, looking like they had been deserted there for a while. Thinking this was left-over stuff someone no longer wanted, and hating for a whiteboard to go to waste, I took the whiteboard up to my room. It occurred to me, however, someone might have been temporarily storing their stuff there for later use. So I wanted to check: is this anyone's stuff? Was this for giving away, or for storage?
Turns out, the whiteboard was never claimed.
Michael Lim '12, of Mather House, who had a chair of his own stolen, blamed inattentive student monitors in an interview with FlyBy. He said he did not think they were properly checking names off their lists to make sure items were not stolen.
"I am pretty sure it was stolen because I remember leaving it toward the front of the door," he said. "It just sucks that I have to get a new one."
Joo-Hye Park '10, of Winthrop, said she was one of the last people to put stuff in storage and one of the last to try to get some out. She said someone might have taken her light blue chair, an assortment of textbooks, and two business suits by mistake.
“At this point , yeah I’m hoping to get it back but I don’t think I will,” she said.

Hey there, Quad residents -- Shuttleboy, your much needed travel companion, now has a talking version available for call.  Of course, those of you who have mastered text messaging may not want to try the slightly more time-consuming phone call. However, since Shuttleboy's text messages have been dishing out error messages instead of shuttle times of late, you might want to pay attention:
Step 1. Call 617-284-2750 (or 617-BUG-CS50), and follow the spoken directions.
Step 2. Press "1" for Shuttleboy Voice (which is slightly pointless, since there are no other options from the main menu), and then then corresponding numbers for your origin and destination.
Step 3. The program will then tell you the next three possible shuttle times.
Finally, no more need to remember the "sboy boy qua" (or what have you) sequence. Easily spoken directions are a big plus.

Remember Diamond Magazine? For those of you who don't, it's the infamous nude magazine that sparked debate despite only being published once online last September.
But the brainchild of Matthew M. Di Pasquale '08 appears to be attempting a comeback.  An email from Di Pasquale has begun making the rounds of several email lists, advertising the opportunity to earn up to $1000 for posing nude in Diamond Magazine.
So, if you "think you're amazing and gorgeous and would like to show off your beauty in the pages of Diamond Magazine," or are simply curious, read on.
The "Model" page of the Diamond Magazine Web site says:
Di Pasquale claims that compensation for posing nude will total a minimum of $1 K, but that it is possible to even "make up to $10,000 just from magazine sales." Models are also entitled to an entire 30% of the profits made from selling their (naked?) likeness in the form of "videos, poster-prints, screensavers and desktop backgrounds."
More after the jump...
Applications to model are due Friday, September 11, with a Harvard casting call the following day. If you plan to apply, is it recommended that you request Di Pasquale as a Facebook friend so that Diamond can "see your natural look and learn more about you." Hey, why not? They'll be seeing you naked anyway.
