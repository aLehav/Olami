After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Change has come to the T at last. While cities such as New York have long enjoyed late-night public transportation, Boston largely shuts down at 1 a.m., the T’s closing time.  Starting in the spring, though, all subways and popular bus routes will run until 3 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday under a pilot program for at least one year. This is nothing but beneficial. We commend Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and his administration for prioritizing and implementing a long-awaited shift in MBTA policy of this sort—it is a major improvement both for individuals and for the general social and economic life of the Boston area.
Late-night T service better aligns Boston with its substantial youthful demographic. The city is in large part a college town, with 50 universities in the metropolitan area alone, including those in nearby locales like Harvard and MIT in Cambridge. For students, the T’s current 1 a.m. end-time is often at odds with when they actually need to utilize public transportation. Longer weekend T service, as such, makes it easier for students to leave the proverbial campus “bubble.”
Moreover, many who come to the Boston area for education stay in the area after graduation, working in fields such as Boston’s booming technology sector. These young people, as Governor Patrick noted, often have work schedules and lifestyles that keep them up late. As such, the current system forces them either to curtail their schedules to catch the T or to go without. This is the opposite of how a city should ideally function—public transportation should accommodate the lives of residents, not the other way around. In fact, tech and restaurant workers have been among those visibly pushing for late-night public transportation. The new T policy gives these individuals a greater level of convenience, providing them with a safe and more convenient way to commute.
This change also enriches the Boston area as a whole, making it a more appealing place to live and work. Extended T service enables greater late-night weekend mobility, allowing for a freshly vibrant nightlife—an attractive feature for young people in particular. More broadly, this has tremendous potential to enhance Boston economically as well as socially. Many businesses that depend on late-night patronage such as restaurants and bars are at the mercy of the T’s 1 a.m. curfew, which limits the pool of potential customers. The new 3 a.m. “curfew” should thus allow residents to enjoy a more robust urban life while both businesses and the government benefit from the economic uptick. It is a concrete step towards maintaining Boston’s reputation as a world-class city in the modern era.
Certainly, the late-night pilot program faces obstacles. For it to succeed, it will need to generate enough ridership and corporate sponsorship to justify its costs. However, if this new policy is popular, then it may become permanent—and given the tremendous, ever-growing demand for comprehensive late-night T service, there is very good to reason to expect that it will indeed be successful.  We look forward to it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wise or not, I mucked about in the sewers of online gossip days after the Harvard Kennedy School’s own Thomas E. Patterson, Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press, spoke to journalists’ pressing modern challenge: raising the average reporter’s “intellectual and professional standards.”Patterson recognized over a decade ago that increased “soft” news coverage played a causal role in shrinking newspaper readership. But that’s not the whole story. Recent developments in soft news coverage foreshadow what could be an ominous future of censored reporting in which journalists must choose between keeping their sources and investigating well-connected elites.
Consider the long simmering battle between the actress Gwyneth Paltrow and the glossy magazine Vanity Fair. The affair in sum: Vanity Fair vows to run a feature exposé on Paltrow; Paltrow allegedly instructs her friends and followers to boycott the magazine, refusing to provide quotes, tips, photos, or interviews; Vanity Fair gives in, and holds the feature back from publication pending a softening of its negative tone. TKO—Gwyneth wins!
Maybe your reaction is: good for Paltrow, fighting the haters. Maybe you’re one of those haters, wondering what kind of dark and dirty Hollywood secret’s been sealed in the Disney vault.
For my part, I’m disappointed. Not because I believed for a second that Vanity Fair found evidence of a secret of earthshaking importance, global in scope, and nefarious in its criminal intent. Nor because I hate Paltrow; I don’t like her (if you watch her 2008 PBS special “Spain…On the Road Again,” I think almost anyone would agree). My disappointment concerns this simple fact: in America today, powerful public figures—if rich enough, connected enough, famous enough—have the power to manipulate the media, the power to kill stories detrimental to their personal and pecuniary interests.
Now, let me rephrase I don’t naïvely believe this is the first story killed by a big-shot, a moneyed-interest, a beloved/loathed actress. Nothing’s unusual about the powerful being—in a word—powerful.
But, in the days of Steffens and Tarbell, periodicals and gazetteers mobilized public opinion, melting the waxy wings of the Icarian class, exposing corruption and muckraking; Woodward ad Bernstein followed leads that transformed hearsay and gossip into impeachment and redress of wrongs against the public good. In other words, a free, independent, and adversarial press developed.
Ideally the press is free under the auspices of legislation that include the First Amendment to the US Constitution and the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The press is independent under private ownership, uncensored and unbeholden to state support in the marketplace of ideas.The press is adversarial when there are many newspapers or cable channels in competition, rivaling each other in pursuit of headlines, subscribing to a variety political orientations or the view from nowhere.
Yet, the adversarial side is under threat: more newspapers cease publication or are revived by billionaires' largess, potentially limiting the scope of their coverage. How will journalists cover the economy and politics under a system more reminiscent of royal patronage than market capitalism? How could we trust newspapers to cover hard news when Vanity Fair can’t even critique an actress’ personal life?
The Vanity Fair–Paltrow spat becomes an egregious example of journalistic decline with its high exposure. Most powerful people prefer not to do their own dirty work; fewer, to do it in public view. Unless Vanity Fair returns in a future issue with a full explanation of the “take-down” story, it will stand as part of the public record that an entire magazine of journalists was defeated by Paltrow'sexhortation to her industry contacts. Vanity Fair emerges from the scandal either disgraced by inventing, but declining to publish, a hit piece with no factual basis or damaged by the appearance of capitulation to an industry's information embargo.
Yet, I also wonder if the entire spat is manufactured: Vanity Fair gets to look like it has serious, critical journalistic bona fides without even having written anything; Paltrow gets publicity and sympathy from her supporters; both reconcile in restoration of the status quo.
I think that Professor Patterson is right to point out the need to raise the educational niveau of journalism in practice. In his book, Patterson outlines his strategy to move the field of journalism towards “knowledge-based reporting,” meaning journalists will study to gain expertise in a field they seek to write about instead of studying only the techniques of writing and the ethics of journalistic practice, in many ways mirroring the Harvard University Nieman Fellowship.
Patterson believes such change must be implemented because “official sources are becoming less trustworthy. There’s a lot more political spin.” If anything thing caused Vanity Fair to cave in to Paltrow’s demands, I believe it would likely have been the silencing of sources the magazine relies on to cover the entertainment industry. Journalists depend upon their sources, but the unreliability of sources compounds when the reporter does not have the background knowledge necessary to fact check or contextualize factual data in the most relevant way.
Patterson’s thesis resembles the advice given to creative writers: “write what you know.” It’s simple; it’s a solid platform upon which to build a modern, independent journalism able to challenge the public’s future Gwyneths and Goliaths.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little bird apparently told Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 that the most common grade awarded at Harvard is an A-. According to Dean Harris, that bird was misinformed. It’s actually an A.
The notion that Harvard awards more A’s than it does any other grade has sparked a heated debate. People tend not to like it when other people get things they don’t deserve, and so the debate has centered on whether students at Harvard actually merit their A’s. That conversation reflects a misplaced and self-defeating emphasis on statistical excellence. Grade inflation and the current GPA system detract from intellectual enrichment, and that is their primary failure.
Perhaps the most seemingly salient problem stemming from the apparent grade inflation at Harvard is that the system fails to discriminate among candidates with various levels of competency or skill. It seems ridiculous that the most common grade in any population would be an excellent one—everyone can’t possibly excel in relation to everyone else. Such an argument is often market-driven: grade inflation, argue some commentators, robs potential employers of the ability to make well-informed hiring choices. Grade inflation could also inhibit hard work: Truly exceptional work is arguably devalued, and students might not work as hard as they otherwise might if they already know they’ll get a good grade.
These are all reasonable arguments, but they assume that grades should (and can) reflect something valuable. Otherwise, students wouldn’t strive toward the highest possible grades, and employers wouldn’t care about them. So why do we all want A’s?
The notion that a traditional grading system can accurately reflect differences in student achievement or knowledge—either within or across populations—is utterly false. Our GPA system, in all its inflated glory, compares students as if they had followed academic programs of equal rigor, depth, and breadth. This may work in most secondary school environments, in which nearly all students do follow a similar program, but it doesn’t make sense in a modern university. Students at Harvard and in most universities travel vastly different academic paths. They take classes of varying difficulty and with professors of different temperaments and expectations. Some seek out tougher classes at risk of lower grades, while someenroll in classes in which they know they can excel. Others still take more classes outside of the fields in which they are most comfortable. Grades do not reflect these variables. Our GPA disregards much of what makes our experience unique.
Following this logic, some may be tempted to get rid of grades altogether. That’s probably misguided. Grades can serve as powerful, if highly imperfect, tools of evaluation—both for oneself and in the marketplace. Eliminating grades would also be a major change that Harvard might be hesitant to make. Given that we’re probably stuck with grades, we should at least have a grading system that fosters both intellectual growth and rigor. I really can’t see how grade inflation does anything but the opposite.
Intellectual growth requires taking difficult classes outside of one’s comfort zone—which is exactly what our grading system discourages. As Dean Harris tells us, an A- is “average” at Harvard. If we’re being honest with ourselves, most Harvard students are overachievers:They don’t want to think of themselves as “below average.” This can (and certainly sometimes does) yield positive results—students may work harder to get an A if they feel that they will otherwise be statistically behind the curve.
The possible negative effects of grade inflation, however, greatly outweigh this positive. Students who feel that they need to get an A- just to be average may be less willing to take classes that challenge them or expand their horizons. Motivated by a belief that GPA informs future success and a fear of underachievement, these students may miss out on fascinating and highly enriching classes from which they otherwise may have learned a great deal. Classes rated as difficult on the CUE Guide risk being avoided when other classes offer near-guaranteed As, so TFs and Professors might feel pressured to make their courses easier. For individual students, the result of such a trend would be a dampening of intellectual exploration and an academic experience without true challenge or diversity. Certainly many students do not fall into this trap—but grade inflation encourages that fall.
The single best class I’ve taken at Harvard was also the most challenging, and I’m not getting an A. Before taking the class, I remember reading the CUE and feeling somewhat apprehensive. Looking back now, one comment stands out: “It’s one of the hardest classes at Harvard that I have taken, but it’s still worth it.” Grade inflation, among other factors, necessitates the qualifying “but.” The difficulty of the class should be seen as a positive factor, as something that makes the class worthwhile—not as something the class must overcome in order to be relevant.
So long as many students see a B as something unthinkable, the grading system at Harvard will dampen the quality of a Harvard education. Reducing grade inflation is a necessary step toward amending that problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Nelson Mandela was supposed to make a quick exit at the end of the honorary degree ceremony. But as the student performers left the stage, he lingered and greeted everyone. Every robed member of the choir, every golden-sashed Kuumba singer. Black, white, Asian, Hispanic: he shook every hand, and gave out some hugs and kisses too. 
Mandela’s personal kindness and joy were dramatic because of the gigantic scale of his achievements. From 27 years in prison to the presidency of his country. From revolutionary to reconciler. From a fighter against apartheid to an agent of racial integration—who was scorned by more extreme black leaders.
Even as the audience laughed at his jokes, Mandela acknowledged his place in history. Generally, Harvard expects honorands to show up at Commencement or to get along without the degree. In awarding a degree out of season, Mandela said, Harvard was honoring the leader of an African nation as it had honored George Washington and Winston Churchill. Much of his speech was about Africa and the role of education and scholarly research in promoting African freedom. 
Yet as I watched the embraces and the excitement in the eyes of Harvard students of every ethnicity and origin, students who moments before had sung together in perfect harmony and now were drawing inspiration from touching the great man, I thought: This is not just about Africa. This is about us. 
The ceremony was Harvard at its finest. Everything was planned and executed perfectly. Yet nothing was staged. Those multiracial singing groups were not assembled for the occasion, like the black student who was once doctored into a publicity photo of a Wisconsin football game. This is what Harvard really looks like and, at its best, how it really acts.
And then I understood that though the reason 25,000 people had assembled in Tercentenary Theater to celebrate Mandela and South Africa, the reason his message of racial equality was so resonant was because we, in America and at Harvard, have had our own experiences in racial discord. We were celebrating our own successes as well as South Africa’s, and were being reminded of the undone work of our society as we heard Mandela talk about the future of his.
It has not been simple at Harvard. When President Abbott L. Lowell opened the houses, he excluded the few black undergraduates, supposedly for their own good. Harvard proudly points to the Harvard-Virginia football game of 1947 as the first time a black player played against whites on a southern field. The courage of that player, Chester Pierce, is incontestable; the Virginia students waved Confederate flags to signal what they thought about racial mixing. (Pierce became a professor at Harvard Medical School.) Less well known is Harvard’s unconscionable blunder at Annapolis, Maryland in the spring of 1941. Harvard deferred to the segregated U.S. Naval Academy and sent a black player home to Cambridge so the Harvard team would be all white.
The pivotal moment in Harvard’s turn against racial exclusion was when John Monro, Dean of Harvard College in the early 1960s, appointed Archie Epps as assistant dean. Epps, who had come to Harvard Divinity School from the segregated Louisiana bayou, retired as Dean of Students in 1999. 
Over the near half-century since Epps’s appointment, this university has been blessed with the services of black administrators devoted to the ideal of an integrated Harvard. The wise and funny Dean Mack Davis died far too young in 1989. David Evans, an Arkansas sharecropper’s son, gave up his career as an engineer to serve Harvard for more than 40 years, now as senior admissions officer.
Integration was never the only option. In 1980 students pushed for a “Third World Center.” It would have been easy for Harvard to buy temporary peace by giving into that demand. Instead President Derek C. Bok appointed the Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes to consider alternatives. Of Gomes’s committee was born the Harvard Foundation—not a separate place to meet special needs of a minority population, but an institution born of a commitment that all of Harvard should benefit from all of Harvard’s cultural richness. The founding director, Professor S. Allen Counter, also raised in the segregated South, is celebrated everywhere for highlighting Harvard’s commitment to racial equality—most recently bringing to Harvard the powerful voice of the young Pakistani, Malala Yousafzai.
These brave African Americans—Epps, Davis, Evans, Gomes, and Counter—are Harvard’s quiet heroes. On paper, a couple of them worked for me; in reality, it has been my honor to work for each of them. Over the decades, in thousands of small conversations with students and faculty and in thousands of small decisions about how to uphold Harvard’s values, they have made Harvard what it is today. They have known about ethnic difference from bitter personal experiences, but have also understood what Epps called the “limits of ethnicity,” that our common humanity and shared values trump our differences. 
One enduring way to honor Mandela’s memory at Harvard is to be grateful for the integrated Harvard they have given us, and to commit ourselves to the hard and not always popular work of preserving it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The clutter of Joseph K. Blitzstein’s office on the 7th floor of the Science Center seems to suggest the classic trappings of a college professor—except, perhaps, the rather extensive collection of feline memorabilia.
“I don’t really collect cat stuff,” Blitzstein, a professor of the practice in the Statistics Department said. “But people give me cat stuff because they know I like cats.”
Blitzstein is the proud owner of two cats—“big fluff balls,” as he calls them. “Worf is the older one, and Jack is the younger one,” he said, clarifying, “Yes, like Star Trek.”
But aside from his love of cats and science fiction, Blitzstein is perhaps best known among undergraduates for his passion for statistics. Since joining the Statistics Department in 2006, Blitzstein’s introductory probability course, Statistics 110, has seen a nearly sixfold increase in enrollment. In addition, the number of undergraduate concentrators in the Statistics Department, for which Blitzstein serves as co-director of undergraduate studies, has increased every year since 2008.
Despite growing interest nationwide in statistics and “big data” over the past decade, students and faculty in the department have said that much of the new excitement for the field at Harvard is due to Blitzstein’s personal commitment to teaching and the enormous influence he has had on the undergraduate body.
TELLING STORIES
Statistics professor Carl N. Morris remembers interviewing Blitzstein for a teaching position in the department nearly eight years ago. At the time, Blitzstein had just finished up a doctoral degree in mathematics at Stanford.
“He seemed to be very interested in many things, he knew a lot about science, he knew a lot about other things too,” Morris said. “I knew he was a good choice, but I had no idea how good he would be.”
Statistics professors and students say that what makes Blitzstein’s teaching so unique are the real-life examples he uses to introduce complex statistical concepts.
“The key is his ‘stories,’” Morris said. “He’s just very good during lectures at telling stories, not just putting formulas up on the board but telling a story on how you can figure out something very interesting.”
“One of the best things about his teaching style is that he’s very good at laying out examples in a very logical manner so they naturally build on each other,” said Matt J. Rauen ’16, a mathematics and computer science concentrator who took Stat 110 this fall.
Blitzstein said that he decided to teach because he has always enjoyed explaining ideas to other people.
“There’s just this special feeling when you kind of see the light bulb going off...when the concept is really difficult, but then it suddenly clicks for the student,” Blitzstein said. “I really enjoy those moments.”
Blitzstein’s teaching style has also been an inspiration for his colleagues. “I would say Joe has taught me a lot about how to teach at Harvard,” said professor of the practice of statistics Stephen Blyth, who is also the head of public markets for the Harvard Management Company.
According to colleagues and students, Blitzstein’s style has helped to fuel the growth of Stat 110, the probability course that serves as a gateway into the concentration. When Blitzstein first taught the class in 2006, it counted 80 students. This fall, 460 undergraduates took the course.
“When you look around the country at similar courses, all universities report growth in courses like Stat 110…but ours is much bigger than expected after you adjust for the size of Harvard’s undergraduate body,” said Statistics Department chair David P. Harrington.
NOT REGRESSING TO THE MEAN
Students and professors say that Blitzstein has been able to successfully raise the profile of the field of statistics among undergraduates without compromising its mathematical rigor.
“[Stat 110 is] probably the hardest undergrad stat class at Harvard, but most people just enjoy the class anyway,” said William Z. Chen ’14, a statistics concentrator and a teaching fellow for the course.
In spite of the course’s growing popularity, Blitzstein said that he does not intend to dilute its content.
“I’m determined to never water it down,” Blitzstein said. “Stat 110 is also the key foundation for the upper level stat classes, so I feel that I’d be doing a disservice to anyone who wants to take 111, 123, and various other stat classes which really require a good understanding of this.”
According to Sebastian M. Chiu ’14, also a statistics concentrator and a teaching fellow for the course, Blitzstein has been very honest about its difficulty.
“He’s still able to make the class very difficult and rigorous, as rigorous as it needs to be, but he still is able to maintain such a good relationship with all of the students,” he added.
BIG CLASSES, BIG DATA
With the ability to analyze “big data” becoming more essential in both academic and corporate contexts, universities around the world—Harvard included—are experiencing a growth in the study of statistics.
Yet even after acknowledging these factors, colleagues say that interest in statistics at Harvard’s undergraduate level has outstripped all expectations.
At Harvard, according to Blitzstein, 68 sophomores declared statistics as a concentration this year, a 50 percent increase from 2012 that brings the current concentration size to 150 undergraduates. For the past six years, each incoming class of concentrators has been larger than the last.
“The growth [at Harvard] has been a little more rapid than we anticipated, but...even five years ago we could see the beginnings of it,” Harrington said.
Driving this growth is what Blitzstein calls “an explosion [in] the availability of data.”
“There’s going to be so much value that [companies] can get if they can get really intelligent people who can just look at the data and extract insights from it,” Chen says. “I’m going to be a data scientist after I graduate—that’s a job that didn’t exist five years ago.”
Computer science professor Hanspeter Pfister said that the growth of data science was such that “it’s basically becoming, if you will, another pillar of the scientific inquiry.”
“We’re amassing all these huge data sets,” said Pfister, who co-teaches with Blitzstein, adding, “all of these data sets contain something, and it’s not quite clear what they contain until you have data scientists look at it.”
This fall, to satisfy student interest in the burgeoning field of study, Blitzstein and Pfister are co-teaching CS109: “Data Science,” a new course with a total enrollment of 327 students, including 202 undergraduates, according to Pfister.
Pfister said he and Blitzstein started to think about the class about a year and a half ago and designed it this past summer.
“I’m extremely happy to be doing this together with Joe,” Pfister said. “He is just able to relay very deep technical concepts in a conversational manner such that, in my opinion, [the material] is very easy to understand. And so it’s been really fun watching him teach these complicated concepts in a way that makes it accessible to non-statistics concentrators.”
OUTSIDE THE DATA FIELD
Statistics professors emphasized Blitzstein’s generosity, humor, and dedication to students as defining traits of his presence at Harvard.
“That’s generosity beyond anything I encounter normally in practically any individual at Harvard,” Harrington said, pointing out the many hours that his colleague dedicates to individual students outside the classroom.
“He’s a very caring person and tries to help everybody,” Morris said. “He’s one of these guys that just make things go better for everybody, and he gets along with everybody very well.”
To undergraduates, Blitzstein’s personal investment in their education is evident in his daily interactions with students.
“He’s just generally a very caring person. I think more so than other professors I’ve been in contact with, he’s really good at just like asking general questions like ‘How are you doing?’ and ‘How things are going?’” Chiu said. “I think that just because how Joe treats his students, I feel a lot more comfortable being open.”
Chen added that Blitzstein’s work ethic mirrors his commitment to undergraduates.
“Joe stays up really late, but he stays up really late because he really cares about what he does, and he really loves what he does,” he said.
In his limited down time, Blitzstein serves as the faculty advisor for the undergraduate chess club. He is also an ardent fan of George R. R. Martin’s series “A Song of Ice and Fire” and the books of science fiction author Isaac Asimov.
In fact, Blitzstein said he once considered writing himself.
“I wanted to be a science fiction writer when I was a kid, but I never got very far with it,” he said.
But for members of the Statistics Department at Harvard, Blitzstein’s choice to enter academia has been a benefit to all parties.
“He has enabled likely a whole generation of Harvard student to engage with that and go down many different pathways, whether it’s into computer science or genetics or finance or whether it’s just not a quantitative field at all,” Blyth said. “He’s made something special of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Democratic State Senator Katherine Clark defeated Republican Frank Addivinola in a special election to fill Massachusetts's Fifth Congressional District seat in the U.S House of Representatives Tuesday night. Clark won with 65.9 percent of the vote overall, earning 92.6 percent of Cambridge votes.
Clark, who lives in Melrose, will head to Washington, D.C., immediately, reporting to the Capital within the next 48 hours.
“What you see is what you get with Katherine,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Martha M. Coakley at a victory party Tuesday night. “If Washington had a few more Katherine Clarks, the country would be in much better shape.”
After a highly competitive race for the Democratic nomination, Clark was the clear favorite walking into Tuesday’s election. She replaces longtime Congressman and now U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey in the House. Markey won his own special election in June to replace Secretary of State John Kerry in the U.S. Senate.
The Fifth Congressional District includes Harvard’s Cambridge campus.
Clark is the third woman to be elected to Congress from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the past five years.
“It’s time to get back to work for middle class families. No one who works full-time in this country should have to live in poverty,” said Clark at the rally moments after she heard news of her victory.
She spoke about her concerns about global warming and about how the timing of her election coincided with the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy, pointing out Congress’s failure to pass any significant legislation to protect families and citizens from gun violence.
Melrose Mayor Rob J. Dolan said at the rally, “I know this small nook of the country is sending a truly strong woman to Washington.” He would go on to congratulate and express further confidence in the newly elected Congresswoman.
A total of 60,937 voted in the election that included parts of Worcester, Suffolk, and Middlesex Counties.
“When I get to Congress I’m going to work,” Clark said. “I couldn’t be more proud to be the next Congresswoman from the Fifth District.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of anti-apartheid activist and political dissident Nelson Mandela’s death last week, faculty members in the African and African American Studies Department said that Harvard should honor Mandela’s legacy and strengthen its commitment to reduce inequality.
“It is a responsibility that is required of us not only to train leaders intellectually and in terms of leadership skills, but also to equip them with a high sense of ethics and not to see a disjunction between scholarship and integrity,” said professor of history and African and African American studies Emmanuel Akyeampong. “And in that we would be following in the spirit of Mandela.”
Susan E. Cook, executive director of the Committee on African Studies said Harvard’s relationship with Mandela dates back as far as the 1970s, when Mandela was in prison due to his anti-apartheid activities. At the time, in 1979, then-University President Derek C. Bok established the South African Fellowship Program.
Through the program, the Committee on African Studies offers around six fellowships per year to South Africans deemed educationally disadvantaged under apartheid laws so that they can study at a school at Harvard. Cook said that over 200 South Africans have benefitted from the program since its inception.
In 1998, the University awarded Mandela, who served as the first black South African president, a special honorary degree. Mandela is one of 13 people in University history to receive a special honorary degree awarded outside the normal Commencement exercises.
Professors said that Mandela’s death should inspire Harvard to continue his fight for civil rights.
“I think Mandela has left us a huge challenge to recuperate a liberal democratic politics that makes sense, a world in which one can agree to argue sensibly and arrive at reasonable outcomes, a world in which one seeks to understand one’s opponents and to figure out how to deal with difference,” said John L. Comaroff, a professor of African and African American studies and anthropology.
He added that Harvard should “commit itself to the greatest degree possible to fight racism, sexism, inequality and injustice, not merely in words but by actions and deeds, substantively and not merely procedurally.”
African and African American Studies Department Chair Lawrence D. Bobo and professor Jacob K. Olupona agreed on the importance of promoting civil rights.
“[Mandela] is a towering figure in South African history, a powerful symbol for all Africans, and indeed an inspiring colossus on the world stage for all humanity,” Bobo said in an email to The Crimson. “Like so many others, I mourn his passing but shall forever celebrate his life and example.”
Olupona added that, on top of advancing equality around the world, Mandela’s struggle for equal rights should inspire Harvard to be more mindful of its minority students and faculty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a typical summer day in Cambridge, a steady stream of guided tour groups will pass by Harvard’s architecturally unusual Science Center building. 
The stories these tourists are told are not always the same. Some guides say the structure is modeled after a Polaroid camera, while others insist that the architecture represents a stairway to heaven. 
From the Admissions Office to commercial companies to local residents eager to discuss Harvard’s relationship with Cambridge, the proprietors of Harvard’s many tour options represent the University in subtly different ways. 
Often equipped with backpacks, straw hats, or Victorian costumes, these guides direct thousands of tourists in and out of the gates of Harvard Yard every year—visitors who flock to Cambridge from almost every continent to experience the history of America’s oldest university. 
Still, nearly every tourist on a tour will bump into a student, stop to pose and caress the foot of the John Harvard statue in an effort to gain some ancient luck or wisdom, and take a photo in front of Widener. Even as visitors learn different facts and stories about Harvard, shared experiences like these epitomize each tour’s common goal of sharing Harvard’s history as a cultural and academic landmark.
BECOMING THE HISTORY
In 2011, Daniel Berger-Jones co-founded Cambridge Historical Tours to immerse tourists in the Harvard of a former century. Dressed in period garb from the 1800s—including a top hat, three-piece suit, and suspenders—Berger-Jones assumes an accent usually missing from Harvard’s classrooms today as he strolls, cane in hand, through the streets. He wants to bring alive a long-gone Harvard.
“Our tour group is for folks who are trying to figure out why this place is so famous, the people, the stories, the legends,” Berger-Jones says.
Dressed in full Victorian attire and playing the role of individuals affiliated with Harvard during the 40-year term of University President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, leaders for Jones’s company offer a 70-minute tour full of grand tales, personal narratives, and accounts of little-known facts about Harvard’s history.
“We stand outside the buildings and tell the stories,” says Max J. Pacheco, a Cambridge Historical Tours guide perhaps better known as his alter ego Irving Kolpeck, a sharp Harvard student and paperboy from the early 20th century. 
Berger-Jones says that his tours are “98 to 99 percent accurate,” and added that the group looks at old articles, newspapers, and archives of Harvard correspondence to find its information.
THE OFFICIAL RECORD
When asked about the relationship between the University and private tour groups, University spokesperson Tania M. deLuzuriaga wrote in an email that Harvard “has no editorial control over the content of tours that are run by private entities.”
For its part, the University offers a number of official tours, including the Harvard Information Center’s Guided Historical Tour. More than 45,000 visitors have taken that tour since the beginning of 2013, according to deLuzuriaga.
H Luke M. Anderson ’14, a tour guide at the Information Center, says that he tries to disseminate information about Harvard and its history—without any fluff. 
“It’s like when you go to any historical place. You want to get a good overview of it. You want to leave with something,” he says. “If you go to the Colosseum, you want to be provided with a good, non-biased history of the landmark. I think that’s what we provide, particularly in this office.”
As a tour guide, Anderson says he believes he should provide a holistic description of the University to the people that visit from all over the world. However, he adds, that does not mean that the tours exaggerate or fabricate information about Harvard in order to cover up its shortcomings. 
“We definitely incorporate a lot about student life and anecdotes about the school that the tourists might find interesting, but [the tours consists of] pretty unbiased facts about Harvard’s history.”
Other official tour options include an admissions tour, a tour of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and tours hosted by the student-led Crimson Key Society. There is no administrative body within Harvard that coordinates with all of the institution’s affiliated and non-affiliated tour groups, deLuzuriaga wrote.
Both Anderson and Haley K. Fuller ’14, president of the Crimson Key Society, say that the University does not strictly control or monitor the content of either the Guided Historical Tour or the tours provided by the Crimson Key Society. 
BLENDING FACT AND FUN
In the summer of 2006, Jordan C. Jones ’07 and Daniel A. Schofield-Bodt ’07 began giving independent tours of Harvard after sensing a lack of tour options for summer visitors. After administrators voiced concerns that Schofield-Bodt’s unofficial tours represented an inappropriate use of the Harvard name for student business purposes, the duo changed the company’s name and resumed business. Schofield-Bodt now owns Trademark Tours, which gives the iconic Hahvahd Tour for much of the year.
“What sets our tour apart is a focus on storytelling,” Schofield-Bodt says. With Harvard straw hats and a memorized script of fun stories and punchlines in tow, Hahvahd Tour guides show that “Ivy League schools have a softer side,” Schofield-Bodt said.
The Hahvahd Tour focuses on three themes: Harvard history, Harvard culture, and famous Harvardians. “The dates, the times, the places, those are all important… but the real entertainment value is… the story behind them,” Schofield-Bodt says. 
Hahvahd Tour guides narrate stories about a Harvard-mandated swim test, a riot-proof Canaday, a polaroid-camera-modeled Science Center, a naked primal scream. They sometimes quip that John F. Kennedy ’40 got “shafted by the University” when elevator construction destroyed his old room. 
Some of these anecdotes highlight inconsistencies between tours. For example, the Hahvahd Tour asserts that Eleanor Elkins Widener included a mandatory swim test for all Harvard students as a condition for donating her son’s book collection to found Widener Library after he drowned with the Titanic. This contradicts the Cambridge Historical Tours, which note that Harvard’s swim test was instituted because administrators at the time had served in the Navy and would not have been content if Harvard boys could not swim. 
In between tour stops, or “stages,” as Schofield-Bodt describes them, guides field questions about admissions or current student life, allowing for a more modern and personal perspective of Harvard. 
From historical role play to lighthearted satire to direct exposition, the varying natures of Harvard’s many affiliated and unaffiliated tours provide tourists with diverse options to shape their usually brief experiences of the University. Nevertheless, each tour is grounded in the presentation of Harvard as a landmark whose history and character are continually being shaped and unveiled. 
“People from all around the world are coming, and they’re coming because they’ve heard great things and they want to experience it,” says Anderson, Information Center tour guide. “I think that we give them the chance to experience it firsthand.”

Administrators, students, and other affiliates of Harvard Business School gathered Monday afternoon to celebrate the dedication of the newly completed Tata Hall, the future home of the Business School’s executive education program. 
Construction of the 163,000 square foot building, which will include residential and learning space for the executive education program, began in Dec. 2011. Currently, students in the program, which trains over 10,000 professionals from around the world on issues related to business management, live in McArthur, Baker, and Mellon halls.
“The best thing about the building is the name,” said former Business School Dean Jay O. Light, who, along with University President Drew G. Faust and current Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, among others, spoke at the ceremony Monday.
Tata Hall is named after Indian tycoon and University donor Ratan N. Tata, a former student in the advanced management branch of the executive education program. Construction of the building was partially funded by a $50 million dollar donation from Tata Group, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, and the Tata Education and Development Trust. 
Light praised the river-facing building, calling it “the greatest reigning key site on the Charles River.” Like other speakers at the ceremony, he said that Tata Hall is notable for its interior, which was designed to cater to the needs of the executive education program. The building includes two large “breakout” spaces and two 99-seat tiered case-study classrooms. 
“Through the masterful use of technology and space, Tata Hall has been specifically designed to raise the level of [student] interaction to new heights,” said Das Narayandas, chair of the executive education program. “This graceful building will help enormously in furthering our mission to shape future leaders for generations to come.”
According to a press release, Tata Hall, which was designed by William Rawn Associates, was built to attain LEED Platinum certification, the highest level awarded by the United States Green Building Council based on a structure’s efficiency and sustainability. Among the building’s green features are a low-flow plumbing system and a solar array used to generate air conditioning power. The building has yet to be certified.
At the dedication, speakers commented on the growth of the executive education program, pointing to its diverse participant pool and gifts from international donors.
“Almost 60 years ago when I was a student here, there were no women in my classroom and there were no Indians either,” said C. Dixon Spangler Jr., a former president of the University Board of Overseers who is the namesake of the Harvard Business School’s student center. “Now the president of Harvard is a woman, and the dean of the business school was born in India. So Harvard too has changed and changed very much for the better.” 
Looking back at the multiyear planning and construction process, Nohria said that he feels a “sense of relief,” prompting laughter from the audience. 
“We look forward to welcoming remarkable leaders, investing in their education, and contributing to their ability to make a profound difference in the world,” Nohria said.

With the help of a $5 million gift, the John F. Kennedy School of Government will rename the Joan Shorenstein Center for Press, Politics and Public Policy to reflect its changing mission and launch the Walter Shorenstein Fellowship in Media and Democracy, the school announced Monday.
“The point of the fellowship is to bring very high-profile people in who will, in and of themselves, create interest and basically give students at HKS and Harvard general exposure to people who are at the top of the field,” said Alex S. Jones, director of the Shorenstein Center, the research center within HKS that will manage the fellowship. “We want this to be something that is real world, that has real results, and that’s the kind of thing that excites most of the students at the Kennedy School.”
According to a press release from the Shorenstein Center Monday, the fellowship will be funded the $5 million donation from Doug and Lydia Shorenstein in honor of Doug’s late father, Walter. A real estate entrepreneur, Walter established the Shorenstein Center in 1985 after the passing of his daughter, Joan Shorenstein Barone, who produced The CBS Evening News with Dan Rather.
“The Shorenstein Center was one of my father’s proudest achievements,” Doug Shorenstein wrote in the press release, “and I am delighted to be able to make this gift to honor his legacy and keep his influence alive.”
The Center also announced that it will change its name from the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy to the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.
Jones explained that the switch from “Press” to “Media” in the Center’s name reflects a change in its focus that has developed over the past few years. By referring to media rather than press, the Center intends to include non-traditional news media.
“We’re simply changing it to reflect the reality of what we do. We have been focused on media in the broadest sense for a number of years. But we thought it was time to go ahead and change our name,” Jones said.
He did not name specific people who the Center hopes to recruit for the fellowship program but said the recruitment process has already begun.
 In light of the recent grant, Jones expressed optimism about the Center’s future.
 “It means that we are moving forward,” Jones said. “I feel that the Shorenstein Center is on sound financial footing for years to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore women’s hockey goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer is used to being the only girl around.
In 2004, she was the second female goalie ever to compete in the Brick Tournament, a seven-day amateur tournament for 10-year-olds in Edmonton, Alberta. In 2012, she was the second female to take part in the Alberta Junior Hockey League.
In fact, Maschmeyer said she hadn’t officially played women’s hockey until joining the Crimson last year.
“The games are a lot different,” Maschmeyer said. “The guys are more aggressive—they’re allowed to be with the rules. The girls have to rely more on their sticks. Naturally guys are going to be taller and stronger, so they’re going to be faster and their shots are going to be harder. The skill level in girls hockey is very good, especially at this level.”
The fourth in a line of five siblings, all of whom play hockey at various levels, Maschmeyer has been on the ice for as long as she can remember. And as the only goaltender in the family, she’s gotten a lot of practice.
“I started hockey when I was three years old,” Maschmeyer said. “We really have an easy outdoor rink at home and my dad would always take us out there for hours every night to practice. I actually started out as a player. I played out until I was seven, and then switched to goalie. I loved it right from the start.”
After being named to the Bantam AA and AAA Boys All-Star teams, Maschmeyer joined the Lloydminster Bobcats in 2010.
The goaltender helped her team win a gold medal at the Canada Winter Games later that season. In 2012, she led her IIHF Ice Hockey team to the U-18 Women’s World Championship, winning the title over Team USA.
While remaining on Team Canada’s U-22 team, Maschmeyer has led the Crimson to a successful season thus far, compiling a 9-1-2 overall record.
“It comes naturally to her,” coach Maura Crowell said. “She wants to be the best goalie in the country and that’s what fuels her, that’s what motivates her. That comes from within.”
In Harvard’s contest against Boston College on Sunday afternoon, the sophomore achieved a career-high 51 saves, the third highest in Harvard history, keeping the back of the net empty until the final two minutes.
“She was unbelievable on Sunday and we played well in front of her,” Crowell said. “[She had some] insane saves that 99 percent of the goalies out there wouldn’t be able to make, but she comes up with them. That’s part of her athletic ability…She always gives us a chance to win.”
When Maschmeyer arrived at Harvard last year, she played in rotation with then-senior Laura Bellamy, who had already proven her talent, leading the team to two NCAA tournaments and the Ivy League Championship during her career.
With the two alternating playing time, they helped each other improve throughout the season. Maschmeyer was named to the ECAC All-Rookie team and became the first goaltender to win Ivy League Rookie of the Year since 1995.
“Last year it was really competitive, but a friendly competition between us,” Maschmeyer said. “[Bellamy] was someone I could really look up to and turn to her if I had any questions. It was really great to work with the goalie team.”
The addition of freshman Brianna Laing this season has allowed Maschmeyer to give back to her team, offering the same support she received as a rookie.
“I’m trying to do the same thing for [Laing] because I have a year of experience now,” Maschmeyer said. “I’m trying to guide her through something whenever she has questions. She’s a very good goalie, too, so it’s a really good competition. And, again, a friendly competition, which helps us both get better.”
As a sophomore on a squad with only two seniors and seven freshman, Maschmeyer recognizes her place as one of the team’s “upperclassmen” leaders on the ice.
“I try to lead by example, through my actions,” said Maschmeyer, who leads the nation in save percentage at 96.4%. “We have a short roster this year. I want to be supportive to all of the freshmen and everyone else on the team. I [try to] take it one game at a time and give my team the opportunity to win every game. We can’t leave anything behind.”
Crowell acknowledges Maschmeyer’s tendency to churn out high performances without demanding the attention.
“She’s a quiet leader,” Crowell said. “It’s not like she’s a big talker in the locker room, but she goes about her business in a way that is consistent [and] reliable, and [she] always plays at an extremely high level. It’s something that we’ve come to depend on and she hasn’t let us down…She knows what she needs to do to be at the top of her game and she brings it every time she gets a chance to play.”
Despite her success thus far, Maschmeyer’s career is far from over. She looks to continue to break both personal and program-records.
“First, I want to win a national championship,” Maschmeyer said. “I want to beat my stats from last year and just have the best season that we can have. I have the long-term goal of breaking the number one shutout [record], set by Christina Kessler, who had 25 in her four years.”

The typical incoming freshmen have little idea of what to expect from college. But Harvard freshmen Brianna Laing, Natasha Rachlin, and Robyn White are not typical.
These three women’s hockey players all hail from Noble and Greenough, a preparatory school in Dedham, Mass., known for its excellent athletics programs. The women’s hockey program in particular has sent six players to No. 4/5 Harvard in the last four years.
“I’m very excited and very proud of them,” said Noble and Greenough women’s hockey coach Tom Resor. “It speaks a lot to the type of kid that we attract at Noble.”
Along with Laing, Rachlin and White, sophomore Mary Parker said that nearly ten students from Noble are current freshmen at Harvard.
“We are very fortunate that we have kids here who are very good at a lot of things,” Resor said. “We pride ourselves on giving them a lot of opportunities academically, athletically, and service-wise.”
Although it might be easy to conceive that many Noble and Greenough hockey players choose Harvard simply to follow their peers, Parker and Rachlin said that their decisions were made without much influence from upperclassmen or fellow classmates.
“It was all separate,” Resor said. “[Though] it happened over a similar timetable. They were all independent of each other in the process.”
Even so, all three conceded that the relationship between the upperclassmen and freshmen could have indirectly influenced the players’ decisions. Resor noted that when players go on their visits, the happiness that Noble graduates have at Harvard is “almost contagious.”
Additionally, the three touched upon the excellence of Harvard itself—academically and athletically—as a reason for why so many players choose to attend.
“Harvard obviously has awesome academics, and a great hockey program, and a great team, and awesome coaches,” Parker said. “I think that [combination] just draws a lot of players wanting to come here anyway.”
“For girls who want an Ivy League education and want to continue playing hockey, especially if you’re from this area…it’s hard really to beat [Harvard],” Resor added.
In addition, the Crimson women’s hockey team plays at an up-tempo pace with a heavy emphasis on passing—a style very similar to Noble and Greenough’s system of play.
However, early on in freshman year, the differences between Noble alumnae and other teammates diminish on the ice.
“I wouldn’t say I think of [non-Noble players] any differently,” Rachlin said. “I guess you know [Noble alumniaes] style of play more than others, but you learn the others’ style as the year progresses.”
According to the players, problems with team chemistry are virtually nonexistent, despite the fact that nearly one-third of the team came from the same high school.
“Playing with these girls in high school is a lot different than playing with them in college.” Rachlin said. “At Noble, there’s a lot less sense of team. The team here is a lot more engaged.”
One of the most daunting aspects of being a freshman in college is deciding on a class schedule, especially when there are hundreds of options and dozens of requirements.
For many, this becomes a long and tedious process of sifting through class websites and the Q guide, attempting to design a schedule that is balanced, challenging, and practical.
In situations like these, knowing upperclassmen can be extremely beneficial, and many athletes take full advantage of their relationship with the older players. Rachlin, White, and Laing, however, also have the benefit of teammates who are familiar with their academic backgrounds.
“They know the high school environment that we came out of, so they know what the biggest problems are and how to transition,” Rachlin added. “They know what we’re going through.”
“We definitely help them out,” Parker said. “Just like other freshmen, we help them pick classes [and] adjust to the busy schedules.”
Although the freshmen are getting the advice and help, the relationships are beneficial for upperclassmen, as well. According to Parker, there are numerous benefits for upperclassmen in having their high school teammates join them on their collegiate squad, such as familiarity with backgrounds and childhood friendships.
“I love having them there,” Parker said. “We had so much fun together in high school at Noble, so it just brings that back here in college….It’s definitely a really good experience. It’s fun.”
Rachlin agreed.
“I’m loving it,” she said. “The team’s awesome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For brothers Chris, Tim, and Sean Satterthwaite, going Ivy wasn’t enough of a feat. Instead, they decided to add walking on to Division I swim teams to their list of accomplishments. Chris is the co-captain for Harvard swimming, Tim is a junior swimmer for Cornell, and Sean is a recent addition to the Crimson team.
The Satterthwaite brothers are not the family’s first presence in Ivy League swimming. Their mother, Ann Satterthwaite ’84, was the Harvard women’s swim team manager during her time here. Although she was never on the team herself, her love of the sport is part of the reason swimming became a family activity.
“My mom went to Harvard and managed the women’s swim team,” Sean said. “She just really liked the sport and she thought it would be good to get us into it.”
The boys first started swimming at an early age not only because of their mother’s enthusiasm, but also because of the family’s prior experience living in Singapore.
“Singapore is a very hot and humid place,” Tim said. “One of the best ways to stay cool is to go to the pool. That’s where we all learned where to swim, since we spent so much time in the water anyways.”
After trying many other sports, the Satterthwaites eventually devoted their time to competitive swimming when they moved to England.
The brothers cited many different reasons they stuck with the sport through high school and into college, but all three echoed a desire to maintain the family’s special tie to swimming.
“It was nice afterschool to go to practice with my brothers,” Chris said. “It was a way for us to all stay involved in the same activity. Even though we’re all close in age, we still mostly do our own things…so it’s something we took a lot of pride in and enjoyed doing together.”
Chris was the first to make his mark on Ivy swimming. After getting accepted without a likely letter, Chris joined the swim team and dropped a substantial amount of time. He now holds the Harvard record for the 100 freestyle, as well as a number of relay records. Chris’s decision to swim at Harvard played a part in college decisions for both Tim and Sean.
“[Chris has] had a fantastic experience here,” Sean said. “He got a lot faster, and made a lot of good friends, so when it came time for me to decide whether or not to swim in college…. I came out and visited him and really loved it.”
Sean’s addition to the Harvard team formed a deeper connection between the brothers.
“We obviously shared a lot of experiences at home, but this was something else,” Chris said. “For the first three years this was something that was just a part of my life, not a part of my family’s. They were able to come to meets but they weren’t able to share the same experiences with me. When Sean was considering coming I was excited, and now that he’s here I’m thrilled about sharing my last season with him.”
Outside of the pool, the brothers hang out and help each other more as siblings, not as teammates.
“He’s my captain and treats me just as he would treat any other freshman,” Sean said. “But he’s also my brother when I need him to be. He’s already been through everything, and is an awesome source of advice, which has been very useful.”
Not only do all three brothers do the same sport, but they also swim almost the exact same events, mainly the 50, 100, and 200 free. This sparked a friendly competitive edge among them.
“I’ve always been very competitive with Chris,” Tim said. “The difference was that in high school we had always been on the same team, and I wanted a chance to step outside of his shadow and go somewhere else and compete against him instead.”
Most recently, Chris, Tim, and Sean were reunited at the Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard tri-meet. While they didn’t swim in the same heats individually, one of the freestyle relays pitted Chris against Tim, with both brothers swimming anchor in the 4x100 free relay. The Crimson finish first in the event, and the Big Red team finished in third.
“I think I’m more just proud to share that experience with him,” Chris said. “We finished and we were in lanes next to each other, and even though we won it wasn’t a personal victory and I don’t think he felt slighted at all… All the fans watching and the teams know that there are three brothers swimming at the same meet, which is pretty cool.”
Both Satterthwaite parents traveled from Minnesota to watch their sons compete.
“It was basically the one meet where we could guarantee both my younger brother and older brother would be there,” Tim said. “It was fun to cheer for them, and a lot of guys on the Cornell team have met both my brothers so they would cheer for them as well. Though they were our competitors it was still fun to watch someone you know do well.”
For the Satterthwaites, swimming isn’t a measure of how one brother is better than another. Rather, their love for the sport has tied them to each other and to Ivy League swimming.
“When we were younger I always wanted to be doing what [Chris and Tim] were doing,” Sean said. “If they hadn’t stuck with swimming, I’m not sure if I would have either.”

The end of the semester is a stressful time, and we all need to remember to relax every now and then. Flyby is here to help! This is the seventh and final installment in our Seven Days of Reading Period series, inspired by "The Twelve Days of Christmas." Thanks for reading!On the seventh day of reading period, Flyby gave to me seven finals study songs:
“Hall of Fame” - The ScriptLet The Script and will.i.am inspire you to greatness with lyrics like “dedicate yourself and you gonna find yourself sitting in the hall of fame.” “I Lived” - OneRepublicAnother alternative-pop optionm if that's your thing. “I Lived” invites you to study as hard as you can, or as OneRepublic says, “the only way you can know, is give it all you can.”“New Year” - Beach HouseThe lyrical complexities of “New Year” by Beach House may just trigger your intellectual curiosity, enabling you to study more effectively.“Appalachian Spring - 1945 Suite: 7. Doppio Movimento: Variations On a Shaker Hymn” composed by Aaron Copland Aaron Copland’s classic American composition is based on a Shaker Hymn. To us, it seems to suggest a quaint, peaceful, small town while retaining a degree of majesty. The song’s calming effect is perfect for some of your more stressful studying moments.“Serenade No. 13 in G Major, K. 525, 'Eine Kleine Nachtmusik: Allegro' composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart With a nickname meaning “A little night music” in German, this quintessential Mozart composition is perfect for late-night study sessions.“King and Lionheart” - Of Monsters and MenThe lyrics of the Icelandic Of Monsters and Men set them apart from most other bands, running the gamut from standard love songs to complex Medieval fairy tales. In between is “King and Lionheart,” a love song whose lyrics would not seem out of place in a Lord of the Rings movie. You, too, will be a "lionheart" when you find the courage to re-watch all the lectures you dozed through this semester.“The Streets” - Avalanche City This uplifting song by the New Zealand-based act Avalanche City features solid lyrics that will raise your spirits when you’re feeling down, and has a nice progression that will help you focus while studying.

It’s likely that you’ve been spending your days in Lamont, showering rarely, and subsisting on a diet of sushi, coffee, Cheez-Its, and Insomnia Cookies without caring what anyone thinks of you—that’s how reading week is supposed to be. But the days have flown by, and Primal Scream is finally here. It’s time to get your act together and prepare to show Harvard the goods. 
ShowerThis should be number one on your to do list in general these days. Lamont is seriously getting smelly. If you’re planning to bare it all, make it bearable for those around you.
Get a body wrapIt would be a bit forward of us to assume that you’ve made it to the MAC, so here’s a quick option that will get you into shape for tonight. We're not really sure where you would get one, but it consists of putting some stuff on your body, being tightly wrapped in hot towels, and then losing a couple inches off your waist. It’s like being mummified, only more expensive and you get to live. You can ask your roommate to give you a body wrap as a bonding exercise.
Eat saladFor the first time, use the salad bar. Eat lettuce. You will feel healthy. It will taste like water.
Do 100 crunchesRight before you shed those clothes, do some crunches to build up a sweat and to get a nice tone.
Do a lap beforehandPossibly in slow-mo so you can get into it. Preferably listen to "Work B**ch!" by Britney Spears as you run. Consider it your solo debut.
 
 Most importantly, have fun! Give your clothes to a trustworthy friend who will be stationed by Lamont so you can get dressed quickly and head straight back to studying.
