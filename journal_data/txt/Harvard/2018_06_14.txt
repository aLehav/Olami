After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Trigger warning: Self-harm, suicide, gun violence.
In the second season of Netflix’s “13 Reasons Why,” Clay (Dylan Minnette)—the series’ frustratingly dim protagonist—has a new girlfriend. Played by Sosie Bacon, Skye has a string of stars tattoos on her collarbone, an affinity for graffiti street art, and a motorcycle that makes Clay’s bike seem puny. She also has fresh cuts on her skin, which Clay notices as they try to have sex for the first time together. He stops, then unhelpfully berates her: “You’re supposed to call me, even if you just think about it. Where are your rubber bands? Have you been trying meditation?”
“Meditation is the most fucking boring thing in the world,” Skye snaps.
“Then we’re going to take a mindfulness walk,” Clay insists, to which Skye dryly laughs. It seems that showrunner Brian Yorkey and the creative team behind “13 Reasons Why” are simultaneously self-aware of and completely oblivious to the harmful clichés the show presents. On one hand, Skye has all the makings of a self-possessed, multidimensional main character. She smartly points out common misconceptions about mental health, like when Clay visits her in the hospital after an instance of self-harm. “It’s like I have all these feelings, and I can’t control them—like I’m a visitor in my own mind. And if I don’t catch my breath, I’ll burn up and blow away,” Skye says to him. “And I know you want to save me from that, and I love you for it. But you can’t.” The key word is “save.” Skye, and presumably the writers who created her, know that mental health extends beyond the romantic spats like the one to which Clay originally attributes this instance of self-harm, and requires more support than a boyfriend-turned-savior. Skye’s story is—or should be—less male-centric and more complex than that.
But it isn’t. Skye’s character is sidelined, only brought onto the screen to teach Clay a lesson or two before mysteriously disappearing into her own unseen world of mental health recovery. Her whole premise reads like some punk dreamgirl who teaches Clay how to be wild—but sensitive—before vanishing once her character is no longer useful, once Clay knows how to wield a can of graffiti with artistic expertise and offer wilting flowers to girls who are hurting. “You really do have a thing for complicated girls,” Clay imagines Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford) saying to him, as he watches Skye’s ambulance drive away. Skye’s selective screen time completely contradicts the values Skye embodies.
This is the constant tug-of-war that defines the second season of “13 Reasons Why.” When its first installment was originally released in 2017, viewers, publications, and mental health professionals both praised and criticized the Netflix series adaptation of Jay Asher’s novel, and very quickly, the conversation expanded beyond mental health itself to the representations of it. The show’s producers anticipated the backlash over the second season—which extends past the timeline of Asher’s book—as Netflix commissioned a study with the Northwestern University’s Center on Media and Human Development looking at the ways “13 Reasons Why” affected teens. In response to the results, they prefaced episodes with trigger warnings and the season premiere with an introduction of the show by the actors—not the characters. “Two-thirds of parents in our study asked to have the cast come out of character to discuss how to get support,” Wright wrote in the press release. Perhaps the fourth-wall breaking would remind viewers that “13 Reasons Why,” despite its relevant subject matter, is above all, fiction.
Fiction though, is a dangerous space, particularly when it chooses to revive a dead girl for 13 long hours. In the first season, Hannah only existed in flashbacks or “in stereo,” via the tape recordings she left behind for the people who wronged her. But in the second season, Hannah is brought back as a ghost, an in-the-flesh hallucination only Clay can see, presumably because he’s the one who dreamed her up. “Are you real?” Clay asks.
“Do you see me?” Hannah’s ghost responds.
“Are you corporeal?”
“That seems like a science fiction question.”
“Can I touch you?”
“That seems like a loaded question.”
The answers should all be “no,” but the show continues to dodge the question, even though that implies that Hannah Baker is in some way, alive again. It’s disturbing, and not just for Clay. One of the critiques held against the first season was that it glamorized suicide. Mental health professionals raised alarm over the potential for suicide contagion, a phenomenon in which one suicide can trigger others. And it seemed like “13 Reasons Why” was listening with all sincerity. At one point, the show’s administrative villain brings up a compelling point to justify a cruel policy that restricts the students from talking about suicide at all: “Kids get talking about Hannah, maybe even admiring what she did. They might think that somehow, this is an answer. It might be a way for other kids to feel their pain, that they could live on after they die.”
But they can’t. Reviving Hannah Baker presents a risky, desperate illusion that suicide guarantees an afterlife in which you can still have conversations with your loved ones and witness karmic retribution against those who have wronged you. In the last episode, Hannah’s ghost attends her own service. She’s just a product of Clay’s imagination, but it’s difficult to remember that when the actress behind the character is sitting there, alone in the church pews. She’s there as the people who hurt her gather, presumably to hear and say beautiful words about a beautiful girl after she died—because she died. And it might be hard for viewers to realize that she can’t hear these things now.
You could argue that the show wouldn’t be as interesting without Hannah Baker, the reigning heroine even in memoriam. But that’s exactly the point: Suicide shouldn’t be sold as entertainment. It should be talked about, not spectacularized. “13 Reasons Why” disguises itself as a savior, sometimes recognizing problematic content within its own written dialogue. But any relevant messages that “13 Reasons Why” attempts to deliver get twisted or lost in the drama and lights of the show.
Take, for example, its very last scene. After being raped in a controversially graphic depiction, Tyler Down (Devin Druid) piles rifles into the back of his trunk and sets out for the school while the students are at their Spring Fling. He notifies the girl he likes about his plan, who then goes on to alert those close to Tyler at the dance. At this point, the reasonable course of action would be to protect themselves and call the police, like what child psychologist and “13 Reasons Why”’s series consultant, Rebecca Hedrick, recommends in “Beyond the Reasons,” Netflix’s talk-show style one-episode spinoff that gathers different cast and crew members to try to break down the series’ themes. “We would never advise anyone who’s exposed to an active shooter to confront them, even if it’s a loved one,” she said. “We would advise to get away.”
But instead, Clay plays hero and tries to save Tyler from shooting the school with a small act of kindness. It’s a bizarre twist of foolish heroism that miraculously works, ignoring Tyler’s predisposition to violence and his pre-established obsession with guns. It makes no sense, and as Vox aptly puts it, “it reinforces the myth that school shooters are the victims of bullying pushed to the breaking point and lashing out against their tormentors.” The show simply does not have enough bandwidth (nor the right approach, considering this controversial decision was tacked on right at the season’s end with no time to process afterwards) to unpack issues like gun violence when they're already struggling to safely portray suicide.
“13 Reasons Why” also puts guns in the hands of teens two other times, a disturbing image considering the second season was released on May 18, just a few months after the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. On June 6, the series was renewed for a third volume, set to be released in 2019. "It’s engaging content. It is controversial,” Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said at the streaming service’s annual shareholder meeting in defense of the decision. “But nobody has to watch it."
But as cultural phenomenons tend to do, “13 Reasons Why” extends far beyond the laptop screen. It seeps into our daily lives, manifesting in memes or promposals or even suicide. The appeal of TV is that it is so good at glamorizing its content, and it is so easy to spread.
“13 Reasons Why” is the show that never should have existed. Dan Reidenberg, the executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, was apparently contacted a month before its debut. Netflix asked for guidance. Reidenberg said that they should stop. "But that wasn't an option," Reidenberg said. "That was made very clear to me."
Maybe third time’s the charm. There need to be conversations about mental health and suicide if we ever want to destigmatize mental illness. But if Netflix keeps romanticizing trauma under the guise of heroism, then we will always be stuck on conversations about the representations of mental illness, and never mental illness itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s never been a better time to be a fan. This golden age of entertainment, defined by a deluge of available content and social media platforms, has allowed fans to more easily connect both to other fans and to the creators of the works they love. The word “fandom” is really fitting for many of these devoted groups. Just as “kingdom” signifies that authority within a state’s borders lies with the king, “fandom” conveys the new power that fans hold in the world of entertainment. Fans have always had some power to take the object of their love into their own hands. That is what fan fiction, art, role-plays, and conventions are for. But increasingly, fans can do more than create alternatives and supplements. They can affect the works themselves.Fandoms can use their collective voice to help save what they love. For example, after Fox canceled the TV comedy “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” in early May, many fans—including celebrities who have inspired their own fandoms, like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Mark Hamill—took to Twitter in outrage, making the show trend worldwide. The fandom’s efforts paid off just one day later, when NBC announced that it was picking “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” up for a sixth season.Fandoms can also inspire great storylines that otherwise would not have been explored. For years, fans of the show “Jane the Virgin” have speculated that a main character, Petra, is queer. This spring, their wishes were met—and the fan fulfillment was no coincidence. Showrunner Jennie S. Urman said that the writers knew the storyline would please the show’s fans.These fandoms’ effects, whether on a show’s storyline or its very existence, represent a welcome power shift in the relationship between fans and creators. Fans are rewarding creators who don’t default to the same old tropes and are pushing for historically underrepresented populations. They are making entertainment more egalitarian.Unfortunately, the power of fandom can be used to very different ends. Greater access to entertainment, creators, and actors also increases the amount of harassment and vitriol directed towards those people. It is disheartening to see fandoms pursuing forms of crude mob suppression and ruining the fun of the very things they love.The “Star Wars” fandom has recently been deluged by this negativity. Many members revolted against the most recent movie, “The Last Jedi,” for its supposed political correctness and undermining of what the original movies stood for. Alarmingly low fan ratings and angry comments, beyond the range of healthy discourse, have exemplified the challenge for creators, especially rebooters: Do you follow your own creative vision and risk alienating the fans that sustain your franchise, or do you stick to what you know the fans will like? The second path is dangerous—and fans themselves should resist asking for it. A fandom that tries to close its borders and cling to the past sacrifices the opportunity to become even greater.Even worse, some members of the “Star Wars” fandom have used their power to insult and harass actors and creators. Hateful comments targeting their looks and characters turned two lead actresses from the new trilogy, Daisy Ridley and Kelly Marie Tran, away from Instagram.No wonder fandoms like these are being labeled toxic. The fans at fault do not just hurt the people responsible for sustaining the fictional universes that they all love; they also poison the fan experience and name for other devotees. Their lack of respect is at odds with the very point of being a fan.The etymological trail of the word “fan” leads back to the Latin word “fanum,” which means a temple or sacred place. This makes sense—the things we love are sacred to us. So we should also keep a healthy level of respect, even reverence, for those things. Yes, their creators, the so-called powers that be, are no longer the only powers around. But fans’ assertions of their own power should not include indulging in mob rule and suppressing dissent. Let fandoms not be realms of stagnation and toxicity. To quote from another work with a large and devoted fandom, “with great power there must also come—great responsibility!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 50 Harvard student and alumni organizations signed a letter last week addressed to President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow calling for the next Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to develop a formalized ethnic studies program.
The groups—which called themselves the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition—penned their letter as Bacow leads the search for the next Dean of FAS.
The Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance also sent its own letter Tuesday urging Bacow to choose a dean who will “establish comprehensive undergraduate and graduate-level degree programs in Asian American Studies—and in ethnic studies more broadly.”
“The next Dean of FAS must be a leader who prioritizes the need for ethnic studies at Harvard, engages regularly with ethnic studies scholarship, and possesses the vision to establish an academic entity that can bring together students, scholars, and faculty,” the Coalition’s letter reads.
Current FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced in March he would step down after 11 years in the position, but will continue to serve until Bacow finds his successor.
In the months following Smith’s announcement, Bacow has met with faculty and students across FAS to solicit input on the search. In March, he notified FAS affiliates that he had created an advisory committee comprised of various faculty for the search.
Ethnic Studies Coalition founder Juhwan Seo ’17 said he received an email from Bacow and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 addressed to alumni, asking for feedback on the search.
“We felt it [the letter] was a really important opportunity as stakeholders, as alumni and students, to provide our input and I think in many ways this is something that matters to a lot of students and alumni,” Seo said. “It’s something that a lot of alumni, especially, assume has already happened.

The letters are the most recent effort in a decades-long campaign to create an ethnic studies field at Harvard. Since 1972—the year when students first pushed for an ethnic studies program—students have submitted 12 proposals calling on Harvard to invest in the field. The Ethnic Studies Coalition sent its own proposal in 2016, which called on University President Drew G. Faust and other administrators to establish a department of Ethnic Studies. More than 1,000 students, alumni, faculty, and staff signed the 2016 petition.
The HAAAA letter, penned by President Jeannie Park ’83, included a summary of previous campaigns for ethnic studies led by Asian American students and alumni.
“Many of us who graduated in the 1970s and ’80s, with fewer than 100 Asian American peers in our classes, fondly remember the single seminar on Asian American Studies that was offered then,” Park wrote. “We are frankly shocked that with more than 1200 Asian Americans enrolled in the College, and with Harvard’s stated increased commitment to diversity in its educational mission, the offerings in Asian American Studies are still meager.”
FAS’s current Ethnic Studies offerings include a secondary in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights or Latina/o Studies, and students who concentrate in History and Literature can specialize in the concentration’s newly created Ethnic Studies field.
Signatories of the most recent letter by the Ethnic Studies Coalition, however, called these efforts “poorly supported” and “under-resourced.” The letter states that History and Literature concentrators in the Ethnic Studies field did not have access to any courses on Asian American Studies, Arab American Studies, or Mixed Race studies in Fall 2017 and that American Studies did not have any courses in Ethnic Studies available for graduate students in Fall 2017.
“It is clear that FAS must find a way to redress the fragmented and neglected state of ethnic studies across various programs at Harvard and establish an FAS-wide entity dedicated to ethnic studies,” the Coalition’s letter reads.
Peer institutions including Yale, Stanford, Columbia, and Brown currently offer academic programs on ethnicity and race, according to the letter.
“Harvard lags behind its peer institutions because it does not invest in the field that is producing the most crucial scholarship for understanding the racialization of people of color in the United States and beyond,” the letter reads.
FAS is currently working to expand its course offerings in “fields of priority to EMR and the ethnic studies track in Hist & Lit,” according to an emailed statement from FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane.
“[T]he FAS administration is having promising conversations about how to strengthen its programs in studies related to ethnicity, migration, and indigeneity, and the FAS is pursuing new faculty to further strengthen the its offerings,” Dane wrote.
Seo said he and the Ethnic Studies Coalition would continue to work with student and alumni groups to advocate for the issue.
"We are basically bringing together so many different organizations, representing on their behalf their desire and interest in ethnic studies,” Seo said. “And I think these kinds of coalitions are really powerful ways for us to bring attention to the issue."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Setting the stage for an October trial, hundreds of pages of analysis related to Harvard’s admissions practices are set to be made public Friday as part of a lawsuit accusing the College of discriminating against Asian American applicants, according to recent court filings.
The documents—to be submitted in a series of briefings in federal court by lawyers for the University and anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions—could preview the arguments and evidence each side would present in a trial. The filings are likely to contain statistical analysis of admissions data and detailed discussion of Harvard’s highly competitive—and often secretive—admissions process.
The anticipated filings will be the latest development in an ongoing lawsuit that anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions brought against Harvard in Nov. 2014. The organization has accused the University of illegally setting a quota for the number of Asian American applicants it accepts.
Over the past several months, attorneys from both sides have been conferring with experts and compiling evidence to present to Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court in Boston. In the coming weeks, Burroughs will determine whether the court ought to decide all or part of the case with summary judgement—that is, without a trial.
Judge Burroughs, however, has stated this outcome is unlikely and has already scheduled a trial for Oct. 15.
The case, which some experts say may reach the Supreme Court, could have broad repercussions for the future of race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and universities across the country.
Students for Fair Admissions alleges the College’s practices violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, while Harvard maintains it does not discriminate and that its evaluation of applicants “considers the whole person.”
In advance of the Friday filing deadline, University President Drew G. Faust went a step further in an email to students Tuesday, criticizing Students for Fair Admissions for targeting Harvard’s “commitment to diversity.”
“Students for Fair Admissions…will seek to paint an unfamiliar and inaccurate image of our community and our admissions processes,” Faust wrote. “These claims will rely on misleading, selectively presented data taken out of context. Their intent is to question the integrity of the undergraduate admissions process and to advance a divisive agenda.”
Faust’s email referred students to a Harvard website providing an overview of the case, a summary of the College’s admissions process, and certain admissions statistics.
Students for Fair Admissions President Edward Blum declined to directly comment in response to Faust’s email, though he said the organization’s filings will lay out its position.
“The documents we will soon file with the court speak for themselves,” Blum wrote in an email Wednesday.
Friday is also the deadline for either party to request that certain evidence be filed under seal as the court considers summary judgment.
While the parties have met and agreed that certain evidence may be tentatively filed under seal and not made public, the confidential status of other documents remains in dispute, and Burroughs has set a schedule to settle the confidentiality disagreement over the next several weeks.
Burroughs has also ordered that summary filings must include a statement enumerating facts they consider to be “truly undisputed” as part of their Friday submissions, as she says she hopes information regarding the case is “presented to the court as efficiently as possible” in light of a large number of expected pages.
The filings will come roughly two months after an April 10 hearing in which attorneys from Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions met in court to discuss the handling of confidential materials as the case moves forward.
At the hearing, Burroughs ruled that a portion of more than 90,000 pages of documents related to the College’s admissions process—which include the files of individuals applicants—will become public as the lawsuit proceeds.
Following the Friday filing deadline, outside parties may file amicus briefs in support of potential summary judgement by July 30. Amicus brief in opposition are due Aug. 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise announced a new model for compensating coaches in an email Wednesday following a year of internal review and restructuring of the Athletics Department’s existing compensation framework.
Scalise’s announcement comes just over  two weeks before the Massachusetts Act To Establish Pay Equity goes into effect July 1. MEPA states that no employer shall “pay any person in his employ salary or wage rates less than the rates paid to employees of the opposite sex for work of like or comparable character or work on like or comparable operations.” Variations in pay as a result of seniority are legal under the new law.
The law, introduced July 2016, prompted the Athletics Department—working with the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth in addition to FAS Human Resources, University Institutional Research, and the Office of the General Counsel—to review its framework for compensating the coaches of its 42 varsity men’s and women’s teams. In his email, Scalise wrote that his department spent six months creating “a viable compensation model” that met MEPA standards before reaching out to coaches for their input via a series of focus groups.
In order to be compliant with the new law, the department will adjust salaries of some coaches over the course of the next year, according to Scalise. Scalise noted, however, that the majority of coaching salaries will not change under the new system. He also wrote that the department will not reduce any salaries as a result of the review.
In addition to potential salary increases, Scalise also announced that all coaching staff “with satisfactory job performance” will be eligible for a 2.5 percent increase to their salaries regardless of whether their salaries shift under the new model.
Scalise wrote that the new compensation plan “meets MEPA requirements and attracts and retains strong coaching talent.” He added that compensation will be dependent on a number of factors, including coaching level, program size, revenue generation, and level of experience.
Concern over a lack of gender equity across Harvard’s varsity teams prompted the former head coach and former and current athletes on the women’s rugby team to pen letters to top administrators last spring alleging that the Athletics Department was in violation of Title IX, a federal anti-sex discrimination law.
In their letters to outgoing University President Drew G. Faust, the authors claimed the department insufficiently supported their team in comparison to other varsity programs in terms of both recruiting support and coaching compensation.
“Our coaches are paid significantly less than their female counterparts who coach comparable team field sports,” the four authors wrote. “The disparity is even greater when compared to head coaches of men’s team field sports.”
Head coaches of Harvard’s women’s teams made roughly $34,000 less on average than did head coaches of men’s teams in the 2015-2016 school year, according to data compiled by the Department of Education. This compensation gap falls across team gender lines. The head coach of every men’s team at Harvard is male, and only nine women coach a men’s or coed team in any capacity.
In addition to program size and level of coaching experience, Scalise acknowledged that “alumni giving participation rates” were also factors in developing the new compensation framework. While the NCAA places certain restrictions on how alumni and other individuals can financially support teams and athletes, the Athletics Department relies on its various “Friends” programs to support certain team and department expenses including staff endowments.
These endowments, starting at $2 million, support the Athletics Department as a whole, while also covering the salaries for certain coaching and administrative positions. Sixteen of the 20 men’s varsity teams have endowed coaching positions. By comparison, 10 women’s teams have endowed coaching positions and, of those, six of the coaches also coach the men’s program.
In order to meet the financial demands of adjusting the salaries of unendowed coaching positions, the department will implement its new compensation structure in two parts. Some coaches will receive revised salaries in July, with the remainder of the coaches receiving their adjustments in January 2019.
Scalise wrote the two-part plan is necessary to ensure these salary increases are sustainable for the department.
“While we acknowledge that making these adjustments is important, we continue to operate in a fiscally constrained environment and are not able to fund the full amount in the current budget,” Scalise wrote. “Given this, we need to make these salary adjustments in a two-phased approach, with the goal of providing all salary adjustments by the end of this coming academic year.”
Moving forward, Scalise wrote that departmental reviews of the new compensation model will occur annually.
