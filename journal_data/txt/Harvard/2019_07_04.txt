After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder withdrew from a Harvard Kennedy School senior research fellowship Wednesday after an outpouring of criticism from students, faculty, and University affiliates.
“I have informed the HKennedy Sch that I am turning down its offer as Snr Res Fellow,” Snyder tweeted Wednesday. “It would have been exciting to share my experiences, both positive and negative; our current political environment and its lack of civility makes this too disruptive. I wish them the best.”
The former governor is widely known for his role in the Flint, Mich. water crisis. As governor, Snyder appointed the officials who oversaw changes to the city’s water source that caused fatal lead contamination, and resulted in an outbreak of Legionnaires disease infecting 90 people and killing 12.
Snyder did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced the news in an email to Kennedy School affiliates Wednesday. Elmendorf wrote that he was “deeply moved” by the messages he received from Flint residents, but added that students would have learned from questioning Snyder about his “consequential role in decisions regarding Flint.”
“We appreciate Governor Snyder’s interest in participating in such discussions in our community, but we and he now believe that having him on campus would not enhance education here in the ways we intended,” Elmendorf wrote.
Snyder’s appointment was at the Taubman Center for State and Local Government. The center’s director Jeffrey B. Liebman wrote in a press release Friday announcing Snyder’s appointment that the former governor would bring “significant expertise” in management and public policy.
Liebman did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about Snyder’s resignation.
Snyder’s appointment last week quickly drew backlash on social media. Harvard students and faculty were among those who rebuked the school’s decision, launching an email campaign and online petition calling on Liebman to rescind Snyder’s fellowship.
The petition — started by former Kennedy School fellow Tiffani A. Bell — had received nearly 7,000 signatures by Wednesday afternoon.
Bell said she was “moved” by all the individuals who signed her petition and participated in the email campaign.
“Human rights should supersede ‘civility’,” she said, in reference to Snyder’s tweet.
Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy also questioned Snyder’s comment about civility.
“Respect is one thing. Silence is another,” he said. “And I worry that civility has become a weapon that is being used by people in power to silence those of us who speak truth to power.”
Over the past few days, a group of Kennedy School faculty members had been collecting signatures for a public letter — addressed to Elmendorf, Liebman, and University President Lawrence S. Bacow — asking them to revoke Snyder’s fellowship.
The night before the 23 signatories intended to send the letter, a faculty member who declined to sign informed Elmendorf of the group’s plans, according to McCarthy, who signed the letter.
The signatories wrote that “in honoring [Snyder] the school dishonors itself.
“What lesson does his fellowship appointment teach our students? That public leaders and powerful elites should be honored for the choices they make, regardless of the harm they inflict on those whom they serve?” the letter reads. “And what message does this send to the people of Flint, Michigan, already over-exposed to poverty, policing, and poisonous water? That their lives really don’t matter? Rick Snyder has already made this clear to them.”
McCarthy said he believes that the pending letter influenced the Kennedy School and Snyder’s decision for him to withdraw from the fellowship.
“There's no way in which the prospect of a public letter from faculty to cancel it was not a factor in the decision making that took place in the last 24 hours,” McCarthy said.
“I also find it striking that this seems to be the result of Snyder withdrawing, not the Kennedy School revoking the original offer,” he added. “And I think that's a crucial detail. Snyder declined to come to us. We did not deny him the opportunity to do so.”
Elmendorf declined to comment on Snyder’s withdrawal. University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on behalf of Bacow.
The Kennedy School has faced criticism in the past for bringing controversial public figures to campus. Hundreds of alumni protested the Institute of Politics for choosing former aides to President Donald Trump Corey Lewandowski and Sean Spicer as visiting fellows in 2017.
Mo Torres, a doctoral fellow in the Kennedy School’s Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy, said that the Kennedy School appointing Snyder is symptomatic of its failure to meet a “certain degree of ethical standards” when choosing fellows.
"It seems like HKS brings controversial figure after controversial figure,” he said. “But at what point does HKS think well, we only need to bring people who care about the public good and care about public health and care about protecting people.”
“HKS just wants to do a lot of the ‘both sides-ism’ and just bring people from all different perspectives together, which is fine, but that can't be divorced from ethical considerations,” he added.
In 2017, the Institute of Politics rescinded a fellowship from Chelsea E. Manning — a former U.S. soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks — after CIA director Mike Pompeo called off a speaking engagement at the IOP in protest.
Elmendorf closed his email to affiliates Wednesday by assuring them that the school will continue their efforts to study government failures.
“Harvard Kennedy School will continue to look for ways to learn from and address the failures of government in Flint and elsewhere,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Officers from the Cambridge Police Department responded to reports of a fatal overdose on the front steps of Blue Bottle Coffee in Harvard Square at approximately 7 a.m. Wednesday morning, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
Warnick said a Blue Bottle employee called the police with concerns about an unresponsive man on the doorstep of the shop — located at 40 Bow St. — at roughly 6:45 a.m. Police later determined that the 26 year old man had died from an overdose, but Warnick said he could not provide further details.
The Cambridge Police Department tweeted at 7:39 a.m. that its units were in the area of Plympton Street near Holyoke Street “following a medical response to an overdose.” Warnick said the Cambridge Fire Department first responded to the call, but asked police to join them on the scene when they suspected an overdose.
“I don’t have extensive details... but I can confirm that it was not suspicious and it was an overdose,” Warnick said in an interview Wednesday morning.
Upon arriving at Blue Bottle, police cordoned off the area of Plympton Street between Mount Auburn Street and Bow Street in front of the shop.
Blue Bottle manager Ryan Stutzbach said Wednesday morning that the business would be temporarily closed until about noon, but declined to comment on the incident. He referred further questions to the company’s press relations team.
Blue Bottle spokesperson Tegan Kopilenko declined to comment on the incident and referred further questions to the police.
Police cleared the idea just after 11 a.m. Wednesday morning, according to Warnick. Blue Bottle resumed its normal operations in the afternoon.
Cambridge City Councillors have addressed growing rates of fatal drug overdoses in Cambridge over the past several years and held opioid response training and substance abuse prevention programming during National Recovery Month in September.
In March, Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale’s office released a report on the opioid epidemic in Cambridge. According to the report, 115 people died of an opioid-related overdose in Cambridge between 2013 and 2017. Among other measures, the report recommended that naloxone — a nasal spray used to counter the effects of an opioid overdose — be made available throughout the city in emergency “smash boxes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Extension School will no longer allocate 100 spots in its summer school program to students sponsored by MiSK, Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s personal charity, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
Though Harvard never publicly touted the Saudi Arabian partnership, a MiSK press release first advertised the five-year agreement in 2016. The release stated that Harvard promised it would allocate 12.5 percent of its summer school program’s 800 seats for MiSK students, alongside a photograph of Saudi-sponsored students in Cambridge.
“The partnership between MiSK Foundation and Harvard University reflects the Foundation’s interests in establishing International partnerships, supporting Saudi youth and developing education in the Kingdom,” the press release said.
Spokespeople for the House of Saud and MiSK did not respond to requests for comment Thursday. Swain’s statement did not address why Harvard was no longer reserving the seats for MiSK-sponsored students.
Harvard, MIT, and other American universities’ ties to Saudi Arabia have come under increasing scrutiny since Saudi journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi was killed last October. Although Saudi royals expressed shock at Khashoggi’s death, experts on the regime and intelligence organizations have concluded Prince Mohammed was almost certainly responsible.
The MiSK program’s closure marks the second time Harvard has cut one of its ties to Prince Mohammed and the Saudi royal family. Last November, the Kennedy School cancelled a scheduled lecture by Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal, who had previously spoke at the school five times. He said at the time that Kennedy School administrators told him they made the decision because of Khashoggi’s murder.
The school’s financial connections to Saudi Arabia have also prompted sharp rebuke from both Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents.
In April 2018, the Cambridge City Council passed a unanimous resolution calling on Harvard and MIT to dissociate themselves from the Saudi government — a directive not followed by either institution at the time. Nearly a hundred city residents, including Harvard and MIT affiliates, also organized an event in February to raise awareness about the schools’ connections to Saudi Arabia and its heir apparent.
In response to the increasing criticism, MIT administrators released a statement in February affirming faculty engagement with partners in Saudi Arabia and offering guidance on how to evaluate new and existing partnerships.
Aside from the lecture and summer program, Harvard has maintained some of its other connections to the Saudi royal family. These are largely in the form of gifts royals have made to several schools and departments over the past two decades.
Several endowed professorships across Harvard’s schools are named for the Saudi royals that funded them, including some in the Islamic Studies program and at Harvard Law School.
