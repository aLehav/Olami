When I get to my first swim practice freshman year, I’m asked to swim the length of the pool as fast as I can. Someone tells me this is called a 50. I do so, and it’s painful—my arms and legs cramp up, and I want to collapse after I’m finished. My time means nothing to me, but I know that Jessica in the next lane is faster, and I don’t like that. I decide that I’m going to improve.
Every day after school, I drag myself down to the school’s basement to swim. With “When you Believe” from the Prince of Egypt playing on repeat in my head, I get to know each mark and scratch on the bottom of the pool. Practice is a struggle, but it always leaves me feeling accomplished, and this inspires me to continue to swim.
However, this determination falters when it comes time to race. I’m nervous—not scared of losing, but worried that I’ll become too tired to finish. It’s an irrational fear, but one that I can’t seem to shake. When I get in the water, I panic, and my arms and legs freeze up. But still, I love it—or at least I tell myself that I do.
A year later, swimming is very much a part of my life. I set a host of goals for myself, including breaking a school record. Even though I still can’t beat her, Jessica and I begin a rivalry (although I’m pretty sure this competition is mostly in my head). We become friends, and I go to watch her races. I never see her at mine, but I think she watches me compete as well.
However, by the end of my sophomore season, I begin to feel slightly jaded. The natural high that I used to feel getting out of the pool each day is mostly gone, and I have to work harder to motivate myself. Sometimes, I even decide not to go to practice, busying myself with meaningless tasks at home and even resorting to rearranging the pictures on my wall. I stop trying and stop improving, but I don’t care. In the spring, I run track instead of swimming.
Two weeks into my junior year, I fall while skateboarding and fracture my collarbone. I am sent out of the pool and back to my room, about which I am secretly excited. However, I quickly get bored. After a few weeks, I want nothing more than to be swimming again. When I go to my local pool and try to swim, I feel a sharp pain in my right shoulder as I lift my arm. So I can only wait and watch as Jessica qualifies for state, silently wishing that it were me in the pool earning a place on the record board.
When November rolls around again, I feel surprisingly ready to practice. In my hiatus, I’ve unconsciously decided to dedicate myself to swimming again. I swim as fast as I can in each set, not allowing anyone to beat me. Swimming is still painful—in fact, I feel the same sense of nervousness that I did as a sophomore—but I want to swim. I work hard during each meet to stop myself from panicking, and I calm myself down in the bathroom before races. But I only see marginal progress. Even with my full effort, I frustratingly watch my times stagnate, and this causes me to once again question my commitment to the sport. I continue to try, though.
Sectionals: the final race of our senior year. I spend the 20 days before the race in a constant countdown, trying to prepare myself, not for swimming to be over, as I had before, but to win the race.
On the day of the race, I again listen to music, only this time it’s not Disney, but a quiet song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers named “Someone.” At the meet, I don’t stress. I yell and scream for my friends swimming their last races. For a while, I just sit with my friend Kevin, knowing that we won’t get to hang out much after this day. But, when race time comes, I’m ready to swim.
The race happens, and for the first time ever, I am able to just swim. I don’t think about anything, really—my mind is frozen, captive to my innate desire to win.
I don’t go to states that day. In reality, the remarkable drop in my time doesn’t even matter. When I get out of the pool and smile, it’s not because of the medal, or the cheers from my teammates, or even because of Jessica’s face as she watches me finally beat her.
There was a time when swimming could have easily worked its way out of my life. Each day that I entered the water, I struggled to keep my strokes synchronized, had difficulty holding my breath for the proper amount of time. I spent many laps convincing myself that the struggle was worth it. Four years after getting in the pool for my first practice, the work finally paid off. Nothing’s better than that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether you are a die-hard Harvard basketball fan or just a casual Crimson follower, chances are high that you remember Oliver McNally’s last performance in a Crimson uniform. It was, after all, on TV.
The senior guard and co-captain played a strong game in his team’s second-round NCAA tournament matchup against Vanderbilt. He dished out a game-high seven assists and was even more impressive on the defensive end, sacrificing his body and drawing two momentum-shifting charges.  Even though Harvard lost, 79-70, it was an outstanding end to a great career.
Despite the disappointing loss, McNally has moved on to bigger and better things. In recent weeks, the future Harvard grad has dominated a different arena – Twitter.
We at The Back Page have taken notice of McNally’s recent hot streak.  Here are our favorites from this past week.
1) Although his playing days are over, McNally is still keeping up with the latest basketball news.  He gave this prediction regarding the nation’s no. 1 ranked basketball recruit, Nerlens Noel, before the high school phenom signed with the University of Kentucky.
“Nerlens Noel is gonna shock the world? I agree, he's going to be a terror in the Ivy next year when he suits up in Hanover for the Big Green”
Luckily for Crimson fans, Noel will not be playing for Dartmouth next season.  We feel sorry for the disappointed Big Green fans that hastily ordered custom jerseys and shaved their heads to match Noel’s.
2) Oliver McNally may not be going to med school, but the Harvard co-captain knows a thing or two about the field.  On April 11, he gave the following advice to Giants Catcher Buster Posey:
Shingles, @BusterPosey ? You kidding me dude? That's an illness you get playing Oregon Trail #dysentery
It’s unclear if Posey followed Dr. McNally’s orders, but Posey’s covered wagon probably made it to a hospital. At least, we’re pretty sure since we didn’t see a headline like this in the San Francisco Chronicle.
Those are the Tweets of the Week. While the rest of the Ivy League is happy to see McNally graduate, Crimson fans will miss his fiery play on the court. At least we can continue enjoying his profound observations on the net.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the team’s annual awards banquet last Wednesday night, Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91, announced Danny Biega as the 120th captain of Harvard men’s hockey. Biega, a junior defenseman, was also recently named a first-team All-American.
Donato, the 95th captain of Harvard men’s hockey, also announced during the banquet senior forward Alex Killorn as the team MVP, sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard as the most improved, defenseman Patrick McNally as the team’s rookie of the year, and junior forward David Valek as the recipient of the Ralph “Cooney” Weiland Award for devotion to the game.
Biega was also first-team all-ECAC and all-Ivy, as well as the ECAC Best Defensive Defenseman and runner-up for ECAC Player of the Year. With 10 goals and 25 assists during the 2011-2012 campaign, the Montreal native was second in the nation for defensemen with 1.03 points per game.
Danny will be the second Biega in the family to captain Harvard hockey, as his older brother Alex ’10 captained the 2009-2010 squad. Steve ’01 and Dominic Moore ’03 were the first pair of brothers to both captain Harvard hockey.
Danny Biega will be replacing the 119th captain of Harvard men’s hockey, fellow defenseman Ryan Grimshaw.
Grimshaw is looking to continue his hockey career after Harvard, and was recently signed to an amateur tryout by the AHL’s Rochester Americans, the minor league affiliate of the Buffalo Sabres.  The senior had played three games for the ECHL’s Trenton Titans this spring, the lower minor league affiliate of the Philadelphia Flyers.
Grimshaw has played two games with one shot on goal so far for the Amerks, the Rochester native’s hometown team, as they battle for playoff spot during the final weeks of their regular season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team wasn’t without its opportunities on Saturday afternoon.
But after jumping out to an early lead, the Crimson allowed Penn to pull even by the half, and the Quakers’ went on a late-game run that proved too much for Harvard to overcome as it fell, 13-11, at Franklin Field in Philadelphia.
The Crimson (6-6, 2-2 Ivy) entered the fourth quarter trailing by just one goal, but Penn’s Anthony Adler added to the deficit with back-to-back scores midway through the frame.
Harvard freshman attackman Will Walker scored off of a feed from tri-captain Kevin Vaughan to make it 12-10 with just under three minutes to play. But the Crimson offense was unable to make a run, and the Quakers (2-8, 1-4 Ivy) drove home the dagger as Ryan Parietti netted his team’s final goal with 30 seconds to play.
Senior attackman Jeff Cohen scored a hat trick to go with two assists for Harvard while teammates Walker and Vaughan added two goals apiece.
The Quakers, whose only other win this season came against No. 9 North Carolina, have struggled to find wins against some of the country’s best competition.
“They’ve played the hardest schedule in the country,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “They are a very good team.”
Indeed, the Quakers eight losses belie a rather competitive season.
Five of those losses have come against teams that were at the time nationally ranked, while three have been by just one goal.
The defeat drops Harvard, which would have clinched a spot in the Ivy League tournament with a win on Saturday, to fourth place in the conference standings, the last spot which gains a postseason bid.
Penn got on the board first two minutes into the game with a score from junior attackman Tim Schwalje, but the Crimson’s Cohen responded with an unassisted goal three minutes later to even the game at one.
Harvard added three unanswered goals from there. Cohen scored again off of a feed from senior midfielder Terry White, sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp netted an unassisted goal, and Vaughan finished a man-up goal off of a Cohen pass with just under six minutes to play in the quarter.
But the Quakers answered soon after. Zack Losco scored at 5:25 and senior attackman John Conneely tallied a goal two minutes later to pull Penn within one, 4-3.
The Crimson’s Will Walker added a goal with two minutes remaining in the quarter to push the Harvard lead back to two.
The Crimson offense was silent in the second quarter, failing to score on its six shots. Penn took advantage, striking twice.
Losco tallied his second goal of the game early in the frame and senior midfielder Alek Ferro scored with two minutes to play, sending the teams into the half even at five.
Harvard was quick out the gates in the second half, as it took just 25 seconds for freshman defenseman Jack Breit to score his second goal of the season.
But Adler struck back less than a minute later to even the game at six. The Crimson again went up one on an unassisted goal from senior midfielder Andrew Pataki, but it was the last lead Harvard would have.
The Quakers reeled off four straight third-quarter goals to go ahead 10-7. The run was bookended by Conneely, who scored his second goal with just over eleven minutes to play and completed a hat trick five-and-a-half minutes later.
The Crimson answered as Cohen assisted on a goal from junior attackman Jack Walker and then completed his own hat trick with one second to play in the frame, sending Harvard into the fourth quarter trailing by one.
But the deficit got no smaller. Adler scored consecutive goals to put the Quakers ahead, 12-9.
Will Walker offered some last minute hope for the Crimson as he cut the deficit to two with three minutes to play, but Penn held strong down the stretch to earn the win.
“It’s definitely a disappointing loss, especially after starting the game so well,” Cohen said.
The Quakers were bolstered by a slight possession advantage, winning 15 of 26 faceoffs and picking up 31 ground balls to the Crimson’s 25.
Harvard was outshot, 48-41, for the game, and its offense was often stymied by the efforts of Penn goalkeeper Brian Feeney, who saved 13 of 24 shots on goal.
The Crimson, which holds a one-game lead over fifth-place Brown in the Ivy League standings, takes on first-place Princeton on Saturday at Harvard Stadium.

The timing couldn’t have been much better. In its biggest game of the season so far, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team turned in its best performance.
Needing a victory to keep alive any realistic hope of earning an Ivy League tournament berth, the Crimson bested its first ranked opponent this season, downing No. 18 Princeton, 10-7, on Saturday afternoon at Harvard Stadium.
With the win, the Crimson (7-6, 3-2 Ivy) moved into a tie with Princeton (6-6, 3-2) and Cornell (8-3, 3-2) for third place in the Ancient Eight standings with two conference matchups remaining. The league’s top four finishers will move on to the single-elimination Ivy League tournament, where the conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament will be determined.
In last season’s Ivy League championship, the Crimson squandered a late second-half lead to the Tigers, falling 12-10. But in the teams’ first meeting since Harvard’s gut-wrenching loss, the Crimson got the upper hand.
After going into halftime tied 6-6, the Crimson controlled the second frame, outscoring the Tigers, 4-1, to grab the three-goal win, its largest over Princeton since 1992.
“We finally put together two halves that we are very proud of,” said junior midfielder Danielle Tetreault, who finished with a game-high and her season-high four goals. “We played well on offense and on defense, and that’s what you need to do to put a whole lacrosse game together.”
After connecting on just one of nine shot attempts in the Crimson’s 10-4 win over Holy Cross on Wednesday, Tetreault had it going all game on Saturday. The junior finished four of her seven attempts and notched Harvard’s first and last goals.
“She had a rough night on Wednesday,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “I thought she moved the goalie and placed [her shot] a little bit better [Saturday].”
“Coach just tells me to keep shooting,” said Tetreault, who leads the Crimson with 23 goals this season. “Sometimes you aren’t on, something isn’t going right, but you’ve got to keep shooting to put points up, so I kept going to goal.”
Tetreault went to goal early and often on Saturday. The midfielder opened the scoring 80 seconds into play, faking inside then going left and firing a shot into the bottom-left corner of the goal to put Harvard ahead, 1-0. Following scores from junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen and sophomore midfielder Kyleigh Keating, Tetreault struck again. With 17:05 to play, the Crimson got the ball to Tetreault in isolation on the right side of the field. After faking middle, the junior went right and sent a low shot past Princeton goalie Annie Woehling to put Harvard ahead, 4-1.
But the Tigers answered with a 3-0 run in a five-minute stretch midway through the first frame to even the score at four. Senior midfielder Cassie Pyle, who finished with a team-high three goals, sparked the run with a free-position score that was followed by goals from Erin McMunn and Erin Slifer.
Less than 45 seconds later, the Crimson was back up by two.
Following Slifer’s score, Harvard took the ensuing draw control, and junior midfielder Mariel Jenkins went the length of the field and finished her first goal of the season.
VanderMeulen followed with her second score of the afternoon 24 seconds later, cutting in front of the goal and finishing a pass from Keating.
The Tigers tacked on two more scores, and Woehling (10 goals allowed, eight saves) denied two bids from co-captain Melanie Baskind and one from Tetreault before the end of the period, and the squads went into the break knotted at six goals.
But the second half was all Harvard, as the Crimson defense held the Tigers to just six shots and a single score in the period.
“I think they’ve been consistent and solid, and they play well together as a group,” said Miller of the Crimson’s defense, which held the Tigers to its lowest offensive output of the season. “I’m always happy with the way [the defense] plays.”
Less than three minutes into the second half, Keating, starting just the fourth game of her college career, put Harvard on top, 7-6. Working behind the Princeton goal, the sophomore faked one way, spun the other, and then flung the ball into the bottom-right corner of the net.
Barb Previ tacked on the Tigers’ final score of the afternoon with 21:57 left to even the score, 7-7, but the Crimson soon took back the advantage. This time it was Baskind who did the honors, driving down the right side of the field and firing a shot between Woehling’s legs and into the net.
Tetreault added two more scores, both off spin moves, to put the Crimson up, 10-7, while freshman goalie Kelly Weiss (seven goals allowed, five saves) came up with three saves in the final 15 minutes to help secure the win.
“We were smart and consistent and solid and made good decisions,” Miller said. “We played good lacrosse for 60 minutes, so I’m happy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most seniors, spring semester marks the end of the road, a time of relaxation and low stress before entering the less forgiving professional world.
But a group of senior men’s hockey players jumped the gun and have already left Cambridge to pursue their professional careers in hockey.
Less than a month after the Crimson’s season-ending loss to Union in the ECAC Hockey Championship Final on March 17, four different players—Alex Killorn, Ryan Grimshaw, Eric Kroshus, and Daniel Moriaty—have all suited up for professional clubs.
Just four days after Alex Killorn’s two-year deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning was announced on March 19, the forward played in his first contest with the Norfolk Admirals, the Lightning’s minor league affiliate in the American Hockey League. Through seven contests with Norfolk, Killorn, the MVP of the 2011-12 Crimson squad, has tallied a goal and three assists in eight games.
Killorn could not have joined the Admirals at a better time. Currently, the team is in the midst of a 26-game winning streak. The last loss came on Feb. 5 at Springfield.
At 107 points, the Admirals have already clinched the division title and look to be the favorite for the upcoming AHL playoffs.
Aside from the winning streak, Killorn has enjoyed other facets of his experience with the Admirals as well.
“Nice being on a team with more Canadians than Americans for once, #bullytheamerican,” the Montreal, Que., native joked in a March 26 tweet.
Yet, there are drawbacks as well.
“Really wishing there was a chipotle nearby. #hotellivin,” Killorn tweeted on March 25.
Four days after Killorn’s Admirals debut, Grimshaw, followed suit, playing his first game with the ECHL’s Trenton Titans on March 28 (the ECHL is generally considered one rung below the AHL and two below the NHL).
After three contests with the Titans, Grimshaw signed with the AHL’s Rochester Americans.
The move was important in its own right, since it elevated Grimshaw to a more prestigious league. But for the Rochester, N.Y., native, the fact that he would be returning home made the signing that much more significant.
“Thanks to everyone for all the support,” Grimshaw tweeted after the signing. “Putting on that Americans jersey was something special.”
In an April 6 tweet, shortly following Grimshaw’s move, sophomore defenseman Dan Ford wrote, “‘Feel like Ricky Bobby when he first raced'-@TheBearShirt” (Grimshaw’s twitter handle).
Through two games, Grimshaw has one shot on goal and a plus-minus of three.
Meanwhile, forwards Daniel Moriarty and Eric Kroshus have also left the amateur ranks and have seen action with the Central Hockey League’s Evansville Icemen and ECHL’s Wheeling Nailers, respectively.

The recent conflict between Currier and Adams has intensified over the past several days to involve Mather, Pfoho, and Cabot—each of which has allied with Currier. Flyby brings you a suggested military strategy for the inevitable climactic battle:
Adams will begin to advance on the Quad. Currier, Cabot, and Pfoho will move towards the Yard to cut off Adams before it makes any headway. Mather will follow Adams, entering the fray shortly after the Quad houses. A skirmish will ensue, and the infantries of all the battling houses will begin to blast each other with water muskets. Combat will be bloody. Tourists will steer far clear of the Yard until the dust settles. And then, at last, a victor will emerge. Generals will meet beneath the John Harvard statue and draft a peace treaty. But who will the champion be? Which banner will you rally behind?

"Harvard is a great place because you have a lot of smart, ambitious people you can learn from, work with, and sleep with," said Jonnie Penn, one of four members of the project and MTV show "The Buried Life." In an event organized by the UC, the group spoke to a nearly full audience at HLS on Thursday. Embodying a refreshing blend of bro humor and antics coupled with the deeper pursuit to spread an empowering message, the boys discussed their New York Times bestselling book, good deeds, and breaking into the Playboy Mansion dressed as Oompa Loompas.
"The Buried Life" is centered on a bucket list of 100 things the group has collectively compiled—from being a knight for a day to asking out Taylor Swift. In every episode of the show, as they tackle one of their goals, they help someone else take on a dream of their own. The crack team behind the project is made up of Ben Nemtin, Dave Lingwood, and brothers Duncan and Jonnie Penn, hailing from Victoria, British Columbia. Their entire journey ultimately aims to ask and answer the weighty question, "What would you do before you die?"
Handsome, charming, and down-to-earth, the guys kept the audience laughing about adventures getting trapped in a wetsuit, riding a bull, and running Ebay for a day. They ended the presentation by asking everyone about their bucket lists: One freshman wanted to drive a ferrari wearing a tuxedo, while another student daringly asked and received kisses from all four guys. Two members of the gang, Jonnie Penn, sporting a scruffy blonde beard and burnt orange hipster glasses and Dave Lingwood, wearing a denim button down he later called his "Canadian tuxedo," sat down with The Crimson and spilled about how they really feel about Harvard, what their toughest goal has been to date, and why college is the time to uncover the buried life.
1. Flyby: So, what do you think of Harvard?
Penn: I got to sit in a law class last time we were here when we spoke at Northeastern. One of our employees is at HLS and she showed me around and I love it. I studied American History at school so coming here is like a great history lesson.
Lingwood: My father graduated from here and so I feel like I'm feeling his presence in every hallway I walk down, and I would have never had the chance to feel that presence otherwise. So I can come and seek and give the finger to my father [laughs]...daddy issues.
2. Flyby: Bringing it back to your show and book—how did you come up with this list of items and narrow It down to 100 things you were interested in pursuing?
Lingwood: We got on Skype and we wanted to make a project, wanted to make a film, and we just said if we could do a film on anything, what would you make a film on? So we went into our corners and came back with these long lists and we started telling each other what we thought would be a great thing and someone just said, "Why don't we go after every one of these things?" And then it was like if we were going to go after all these things, we should help people do things they do as well.
Penn: Our goal is to give people the feeling that they can do anything—especially college students. I think it's easy to fall into routine in any school you go to: I imagine that you have to play within the rules. You're in college to innovate, to come up with new stuff, to think outside the box. We never tell people drop out just for the sake of following your dreams, but the underlying thing is to shoot for the moon.
3. Flyby: A lot of the things you guys have done have been really crazy, what was the toughest one to accomplish?
Penn: Playing basketball with the President was pretty tough; that took two years. Making the show was hard. We worked our asses off, we were executive producers until we hired everybody, we were in the edit basement until 4 a.m. and it was our baby making the first two seasons. Growing a mustache has been very difficult. I've got a beard and Dave's working on it. Dave's working on bangs right now.
Lingwood: One of my huge fashion mentors is Todd from Wedding Crashers, so I'm really trying to capture that.
4. Flyby: The idea of doing something off your list and then helping someone accomplish something they want to do—was this for the show or something you've done from the beginning?
Penn: That was right at the beginning we decided to do that. When we started "The Buried Life," we were all in pretty dark places. My brother had just lost a friend, Ben was going through a little depression—
Lingwood: I got stuck in a tanning bed—
Penn: [laughs] No, Dave gained fifty pounds in a couple months and I was just broke, broke as broke can be and frustrated with the college experience, and because of that we wanted to get out of our own heads and get out of our own lives and explore. Asking other people what they want to do before they die felt like such a good way to do that.
5. Flyby: For someone who wants to embark on a journey like this, what skills do you need to take on this type of adventure?
Lingwood: One of the things we have found is if one of us individually tried to do "The Buried Life," we would have been toast, almost for sure. Embarking on projects with your friends or with like-minded people is a great thing because you have people to hold you accountable, to keep you driven. When you have success, you have people to share that success with and you're not there by yourself. Doing things with a great team of people around you is highly encouraged in my book.
Penn: We're alive in an unprecedented era. It is such a gift to be alive right now—all of the rules are off. Shoot as big as you can possibly think, and if it doesn't scare you to think about, shoot bigger in whatever field you're in. We've seen time and time again: the audacity of it, the audacity of hope [chuckles], you could say. You'll find a way to do it. I never would have thought we'd be here doing this, and you've got to trust what's inside you.
