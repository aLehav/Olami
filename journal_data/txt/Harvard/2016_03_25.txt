After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The sun has finally decided to show up, icy winds are becoming warm breezes, and allergies are making themselves known: It’s spring. Unfortunately, the break in the weather does not come with a break in schoolwork, but that’s no reason not to enjoy the sunshine and fresh air. If there’s one thing that can be found everywhere at Harvard, it’s study spots—indoors and out.

The Perch
Situated on either side of the main staircase up to Widener, these twin ledges offer central locations to study, convenient for the times between classes. These spots also sport an encompassing view of Tercentenary Theatre, which is, in fact, not a theater at all but rather an expanse of lawn. Nevertheless, studying on the perch is a refreshing way to become one with nature. Watch tourists stare in awe at a library; watch your friends sprint to their next class while you peacefully finish your readings. Reserve early morning and late night perching for the work that requires laptops to avoid sun glare.
Due to all the distraction, the perch may not be ideal for concentration. Luckily, Widener also has a nice bench area below the perch on Weld’s side that you should definitely check out.

Dudley Garden

A hidden gem behind Lamont Library, Dudley Garden is a perfect place for focus. Next to the birthplace of Lamonsters, this prince among study spots brings joy to a place with little to offer. Containing archaic attributes like a sundial (Never lose track of time again!) and a historical plaque, Dudley Garden proves no one in New England can resist reminding us how old everything is. But there are more useful amenities: a surprisingly comfy stone bench engraved with a Bradstreet quote and a white-noise mix of nature sounds and traffic noises from just outside the brick wall. Just the fact that it’s a garden is enough to go. The tree shade provides sweet relief from the heat so you can still enjoy the spring air.
And for those who would prefer for everyone in the world to know they are studying, there’s a nice lawn in front of Lamont, which is always nice and sunny.

Et Cetera
For those studying English, there’s the Enclave, a small semi-circle stone bench just inside the gates coming toward the Barker Center from Lamont Library. It’s a perfect place to catch a quick skim on your section reading so you don’t sound completely unprepared. For the science-lovers among us, Greenhouse Cafe’s outside seating is a lovely place to grab a bite and provide your eyes relief between lectures in the aesthetically appalling Science Center halls. The Inn also has a nice spot in front, if you’re the type who listens to a traffic noise simulator while studying. If you enjoy being severely intellectually outclassed, the area in front of Lehman Dudley House (and Café Gato Rojo) always has a nice set of tables up once the weather settles permanently into warmth. Of course, we can never forget the Yard, or “None of the People Relaxing on This Grass Actually Go Here, I Swear.”

“Read these pages and tell me they’re good and let me have them and bear my fucking joy,” says Bea, a character in “The Nest.” These orders might have come straight from Cynthia D’Aprix Sweeney’s mouth herself, and tearing through this page-turner, readers can’t help but obey them. Much anticipated and highly praised, Sweeney’s debut novel rises to the occasion. “The Nest” follows the four Plumb siblings as their lives approach the dreaded, inevitable impending implosion of the mid-life crisis they will each face. After firstborn Leo’s untimely lust-and-drug-induced car accident, their family inheritance—the Nest—disappears. The remaining Plumb siblings must scramble around New York to demand that Leo repay the money they banked on to ease their financial and personal problems—problems for which they themselves are responsible.  While a story about the downward spiral of a dysfunctional family is itself far from a novel idea, Sweeney puts her MFA from the Bennington Writing Seminar to use, weaving originality into the story. She does so by bringing together a colorful cast of characters, uniting their many different narratives through an underlying but omnipresent tone that reflects their self-absorption, to paint a mosaic of the many different times, types of people, and kinds of love that can be found in New York City.
Each dysfunctional Plumb sibling is a caricature of a different member of the upper class. Leo, the oldest, is the soon-to-be-divorced, rich, cheating, drug-dabbling socialite; Jack, the gay, husband-mooching antique shop owner; Beatrice, the once-promising writer who has lost her inspiration, among other things; and Melody, the increasingly desperate mother still naive enough to believe that everything will all work out. Throw in a couple of Bronx amputees, a 9/11 widower, a red-headed Brooklynite, a pair of college-bound teenage twins, and a friend-zoned magazine publisher, and readers have one eclectic cast of characters. Impressively enough, Sweeney rarely loses her reader despite juggling these many different narratives. Their strong voices and individual personalities bring life to their respective pages, clearly delineating where one section cedes into another. The characters themselves aren’t likeable as people—most of them are too selfish and gullible—but they’re attractive because they’re easy to relate to. From Melody’s fear of not being able to pay her daughters’ eventual expensive college tuitions to Leo running away from his responsibilities, Sweeney ascribes to each of her characters something with which anyone can connect.
Raised in a wealthy home with absentee parents, the Plumbs have a distorted notion of what family is. With a story and characters that border on expected and trite, Sweeney’s resistance to sap proves to be an impressive feat. She avoids delving into the saccharine and cheesy by adding an almost sardonic tone to her writing. “How many blow jobs for a Sub-Zero? ...a trip to Paris? Ten? One?” Melody wonders about the stay-at-home Westchester moms whose financial freedom she envies. The novel takes on a nearly arrogant timbre inherent to the main characters’ own delusions about themselves. They believe, naively, that the Nest’s inheritance is something they are owed, something they can fall back on in a world where nothing is free, and Sweeney’s writing reflects this gilded vision.
Another innovation comes in the seamless interweaving of the many different eras and neighborhoods of New York, the book’s setting. Sweeney goes from the modern day to late ’80s/early ’90s Greenwich Village—where “Jack [had] a very particular goal in mind: to have sex, lots and lots of sex”— to the post-9/11 city, from Manhattan’s skyscrapers to Brooklyn’s “neat blocks of brownstones, the daffodils and pansies in the window boxes, the number of families out on the street pushing strollers….” Sweeney explores the memories that shaped the Plumbs into the people they are in the novel and even flashes forward into certain futures, in a masterful display of manipulation of New York’s time and space.  Her understanding and incorporation of New York into the novel concretizes the story, making the place just as tangible a character as the others.
Despite dealing with material that could easily slip into the mundane and clichéd, Sweeney’s triumphant debut novel is anything but. While the story’s plot revolves around Leo and his car accident, the novel is ultimately about family and how money can bring a family together or tear it apart. A funny, satirical depiction of a New York family at its worst, “The Nest” is an incisive commentary on the selfishness and dependence rampant in many wealthy families.

Much has been made of what several years ago, NPR called “The Harvard-Yalification of the Supreme Court.” In a speech at Georgetown University last June, the late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia pointed out that all nine justices had studied at either Harvard or Yale Law School. (Eight graduated from one of the institutions, while Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg began at Harvard and graduated from Columbia.)
President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, Chief Judge Merrick B. Garland ’74 of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit attended both Harvard College and Law School and would restore Harvard’s six to three lead over Yale for representation on the Court. While this homogeneity is often criticized, we do not believe it is the most significant problem facing the institution. Supreme Court justices should be jurists at the peak of their profession, and it is not unreasonable for the president to look to graduates of the nation’s top law schools for qualified candidates.
More troubling are the very similar paths that recent appointees have taken to the highest court in the land. Of the eight sitting justices, seven served on federal appellate courts before their appointment, and none have held elected office. In the words of Yale Law School Professor Akhil Reed Amar, the “Judicialization of the Judiciary” is well under way.
Even the current crop of justices is more diverse than what the pending confirmation process—or unfortunate lack thereof—would likely produce. Justice Ginsburg, for example, worked as general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union before her nomination to the Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit. In a speech at Southern Methodist University in 2011, Ginsburg said that her connection to the ACLU would likely disqualify her today. Still, the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed her by a 96-3 margin in 1993.
The lack of advocacy or political experience that the current nomination process prizes threatens to make the judicial class far too removed from the experiences of the political system—to say nothing of the wider society—that it seeks to check and balance. American legal history is filled with political figures who later became transformational justices. Earl Warren, the chief justice whose tenure saw seminal civil rights cases like Brown v. Board of Education and Gideon v. Wainwright, served as governor of California before his nomination by President Eisenhower. The associate justice who authored the decision in Gideon, Hugo Black, had previously been a United States Senator from Alabama. Given their political backgrounds, both of these towering eminences would likely face fierce opposition from today’s Senate.

“You say you want a revolution / Well, you know / We all want to change the world” - “Revolution,” The Beatles
Over the past few months, Bernie Sanders has roused millions of Americans with his call for a “political revolution” and his promises of Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage. When asked what obstacles stand in the way of this revolutionary change, Sanders tends to talk about the “disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case,” referring to the 2010 Supreme Court case that allowed individuals and corporations to spend virtually unlimited amounts of money on elections. Both Sanders and his Democratic primary opponent, Hillary Clinton, have pledged that, if elected, they would consider opposition to Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission to be a litmus test for any Supreme Court nominee.
But the problems with American democracy run much deeper than Citizens United, and they will persist even if the decision is reversed. Because of totally nonsensical rules that give politicians in state legislatures the power to draw the lines between congressional districts, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives is virtually guaranteed until after the next census in 2020.
Every ten years, per a constitutional requirement, the federal government conducts a census and recalculates how many congressional seats are allocated to each state. Each state then has its own process for redrawing the lines of its districts. The only fixed rule is that each district should have a roughly equal population. The problem is that most states grant the power to redraw the lines to their state legislatures, rather than non-partisan commissions. And there are lots of ways to draw these lines, some more advantageous than others.
Here’s the point: If your party sweeps a bunch of governorships and majorities of state legislatures in a year that ends with a zero, you get to redraw the districts in those states. This essentially guarantees your side ten years of favorable lines. The basic strategy is to pack voters who lean toward the opposite party into just a few districts, where the other side will win with overwhelming majorities. This leaves your party with smaller but still comfortable majorities in many other districts.
That’s precisely what happened after 2010. That year, the Republicans seized control of 20 state legislatures, their best performance in the states since 1952. The results were stunning. Two years later, in 2012, Barack Obama won 48.4 percent of the statewide vote in North Carolina, widely regarded as a swing state. But thanks to lines drawn by a wave of Tea Party state legislators elected in 2010, North Carolinians elected nine Republicans and only four Democrats to represent them in the House. (The state Democracy Party is still contesting these lines in court, but the odds are not in their favor.)
On a national scale, skewed totals in each state add up to tilt the entire playing field. In 2012, President Obama won re-election by a margin of 5 million votes; nationwide, Democratic candidates for the House won over a million votes more than their Republican counterparts. But when the dust had settled, the Republicans maintained a 33-seat advantage in the chamber.
Unless 2016 is different because the Republican Party implodes at the convention over Trump, it is extremely unlikely that the Democrats will take back the House in 2016. The prediction markets know this: That’s why they give Hillary Clinton a 71 percent of being the next president, but the Democrats only a 7 percent chance of retaking the House. The Democrats will face even steeper odds in 2018, because Republicans tend to benefit from lower turnout and have historically done better in midterm elections.
In the long term, the best answer for our democracy is to mandate that states make their redistricting processes bipartisan. But for now, seeing as there is no clear path to end the practice before 2020, Democrats have to immediately start preparing a strategy to retake governorships and state legislatures before the next census. They have to start redirecting more party resources away from the presidential campaign, down toward state-level races where a little money makes a big difference. They have to start playing the game.
John Lennon, who knew something about imagining a better world, once sang: “You say you got a real solution / Well, you know / We'd all love to see the plan.” Here’s a plan for all my fellow progressives, especially those who lust after the Sanders platform: The next four years will be a slog, even in the best-case scenario. But don’t lose hope. Sanders’ policy platform has proved more resonant than almost anyone anticipated; whether or not his campaign recovers from his five losses on March 15, he has already left a profound mark on the party. If Hillary Clinton gets the nomination, she will inherit a liberal base that increasingly believes in the Sanders vision.
If only the revolution can stay alive till 2020, it stands a real chance of enactment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Next month’s cover story for The Atlantic is the final installment of Jeffrey Goldberg’s series of foreign policy interviews with President Obama, a conversation that has spanned all eight years of his presidency. If each interview has served us a taste of what the most powerful man on earth was thinking at the time, then this final piece—an essay, not a transcript like the others—was the whole meal start to finish.
As the name of the essay suggests, Goldberg’s piece lays out The Obama Doctrine, the organizing principle behind the momentous foreign policy of a man whose unlikely rise to the American presidency often overshadows his far more unlikely rise to the seat of Commander in Chief. Here’s a man who went from being the Illinois State Senator to the commander of our armed forces in a mere four years—quite a remarkable feat.
No less remarkable a feat than Goldberg’s essay itself, “The Obama Doctrine” isn’t conjecture from historians poring through State of the Union transcripts decades later, but rather the words of a sitting president. The gravity of this essay cannot be overstated. In it, we see Obama reflect on specific decisions—not striking Assad, pivoting to Asia, intervening in Libya—only in order to make broader claims about his presidency, to situate himself historically among the liberal interventionists, the internationalists, the isolationists, and the realists.
Out of these schools, Obama says he is closest to the realists, believing that “we can’t, at any given moment, relieve all the world’s misery.” He says, “We have to choose where we can make a real impact.” That is why, he says, he stood quietly as Putin invaded Crimea in 2014, a core interest for Russia but hardly one for the United States. That is why he reneged on his 2012 promise to intervene in Syria after Assad deployed chemical weapons on his own people.
But not even the most sympathetic Obama supporter could go through Goldberg’s piece and chalk his decisions these past eight years up to realism. Throughout the interview, one observes an insuperable level of disillusionment in our president. He laments the diplomatic ties and obligations he has to tolerate because of mere tradition—the misogynistic Saudis, the autocratic Turks, Bibi Netanyahu’s exhausting condescension.
Obama also deplores the Western allies who ride on American coat tails, a claim that would be understandable if he at least took part of the blame for his missteps. In perhaps the most irritating line of the entire interview, Obama comments on the failure to stabilize Libya: “When I go back and I ask myself what went wrong, there’s room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya’s proximity, being invested in the follow-up.”
“There’s room for criticism because I had more faith in the Europeans”—no line better betrays this administration’s gross misunderstanding of global power dynamics. A true realist—if we are to take Obama’s self-identification seriously—understands that free-riding is a negligible price to pay for stability and is moreover an inevitable outcome of coalition diplomacy. If our president’s sensibilities on fairness are enough cause to retreat, Russia and Iran are eager to eat the costs of free-riding if it means they could fill the lucrative power vacuum we would leave behind.
The most compelling case for the Obama Doctrine—which if not an offshoot of realism, is something more akin to “isolationism with drones and special-ops forces” as one critic calls it—was blown up this week in Brussels along with 34 civilians, in the deadliest act of terrorism in Belgian history.
Obama claims that “ISIS is not an existential threat to the United States,” rather “climate change is a potential existential threat to the entire world if we don’t do something about it.” This is jaded Obama at work—recklessly allowing his Weltschmerz to cloud his judgment, choosing more romantic, less controversial battles like climate change and the favorite cause of his first term, the “pivot to Asia.”
This is not to discount Obama’s likely genuine belief that climate change demands our attention more than terrorism. But at the root of this claim is not logic, but a fatigue of the Middle East and a yearning for something new. Obama explains to Goldberg about why he prefers to talk about Asia more than ISIS, “They are not thinking about how to kill Americans,” he says. “What they’re thinking about is 'How do I get a better education? How do I create something of value?'” This sounds like a man so lustful for hope that he’s willing to radically skew his priorities.
Hope is the Obama doctrine’s Achilles' heel. Where Obama does not find hope, he shies away. Where a good leader does not find hope, he is duty-bound to keep looking.
David Frum’s takeaway from Goldberg’s final essay is that all of us have disappointed Barack Obama—that our Western allies are guilty of free-loading, that Americans are guilty of overestimating the threat of ISIS to the point that out fear devolves into bigotry, and that the entire world just needs to be more realistic. President Obama is probably not wrong about any of this, but he is certainly wrong in expecting others to sympathize with his disappointment.
In what will probably be the most cited line of Goldberg’s piece, he quotes the King of Jordan as saying, “I think I believe in American power more than Obama does.” Indeed, by the end of this essay, Obama does not seem like a realist, but a man too world-weary to lead, too keen on finding hope to take hopeless situations seriously.

When picturing a pre-med undergraduate, one tends to think of a student poring over p-sets, staring into microscopes, and stirring beakers. And while those activities certainly apply to the experiences of pre-med students at Harvard, some also choose to explore another area: Classics.
Over the course of the past few years, the Classics Department has mapped out and publicized a dedicated plan of study for concentrators who are also on the pre-med track, according to Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Classics Kathleen M. Coleman.
While Classics concentrators, along with concentrators in the humanities, have long pursued this option, many pre-med students were previously unaware that the option existed, Coleman said. As a result of this lack of awareness, the department created a detailed plan of study, available on their website, several years ago for the Classical Civilizations track. Several months ago, the department also created a plan for its Classical Languages and Literatures track.
“I think simply that people never think of it,” Coleman said of jointly pursuing pre-med requirements and a Classics degree. “They think the way to do pre-med at college is to do a STEM concentration, and certainly you can do that.”
But, Coleman said, students who believe that concentrations in STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—are necessary for medical school run the risk of missing out on the benefits of a humanistic education.
“Learning how to read, analyze, think, and articulate is the key to success at everything one does, and classics is particularly good at inculcating rigor and discrimination because our material is so fragmentary,” Coleman said.
Michael S. Hughes ’15, a former Classics concentrator and a current student at the Harvard Medical School, echoed Coleman in praising the applicability of the classics to medicine.
“Besides all of the fancy [medical] terminology that gets thrown around that has its roots in Latin and Greek, classics teaches you not necessarily a lot of information but a lot of knowledge and a lot of skills,” Hughes said.
In particular, Hughes said his background in the classics allowed him, once in medical school, to assimilate vast amounts of information.
“There are something like 250 verb forms in Latin,” Hughes said. “That’s a lot of things. How does someone do that?”
Hughes said his education in the classics taught him how to group and analyze different forms of verbs so they are more manageable, a method that lately has proven useful in helping him memorize medical terminology.
“Like with medicine and a lot of other subjects, there’s simply too much information to memorize it all,” Hughes said. “You have to understand how the stuff is put together.”
Gabriel E. Molina ’15, also a former Classics concentrator who now studies at the Medical School, said he believes the classics will help him communicate with and relate to patients.
“It was thanks to my studying in my classics courses that I got to think more about what it’s like to be human, what a human experience actually means,” Molina said. “You get a better sense of what patients are going through in their lives outside of their diseases.”
While there are currently no Classics concentrators on the pre-med track, Coleman said she hopes as students become more aware of the option, more prospective doctors will join the concentration.
“Classics is the kind of thing that is absolutely for everybody,” she said.

Sage Cannabis is one step closer to opening a proposed medical marijuana dispensary in Cambridge following a televised hearing in which city councillors questioned the safety of the proposed site and ultimately voted to move the proposal forward.
Following the two-hour hearing, the City Council’s Zoning and Ordinance Committee voted 5-0 to forward Sage Cannabis’ zoning proposal to the council at-large with a favorable recommendation.
Michael H.L. Dundas, CEO of Sage Cannabis, and his attorney Sean D. Hope appeared before the committee on Thursday in an attempt to change Cambridge’s zoning laws. The proposed change would create a new zone in between Harvard Square and Central Square where medical marijuana could be legally sold. There are currently two zones that cover the northeastern and northwestern sections of the city.
The committee favored Cannabis’ proposal because the company presented extensive research, according to Councillor Leland Cheung.
“We have a proponent with the petition who has clearly gone out and reached out to the neighborhood, clearly thought through all the issues that Cambridge residents have in terms of safety, in terms of effects,” Cheung, the chair of the zoning committee, said.
While the committee ultimately found favor with Sage Cannabis’ proposal, Councillor David P. Maher said he was “skeptical” of the zoning proposal and worried that a new zone would give an exception to only one company, which could set precedent for future dispensaries. If approved, the new zone, which spans one block on Massachusetts Avenue, could make it difficult for other dispensaries to open in the Square.
“For me this comes down to an issue of fairness,” Maher said. “We’re doing a special favor for one company, and I don’t think that’s the way it should happen.”
In response, Councillor Jan Devereux argued that while approval could appear to be favoritism, the needs of patients who seek medical marijuana represent more important concerns.
“One could characterize it as doing a favor to one applicant but it’s also doing a service to the patients who have waited a long time to see medical marijuana become available in Cambridge,” Devereux said.
Councillors were also concerned about the security of the site, and the possibility for illicit dealings. When questioned by Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern whether it would be in Dundas’ interest to supply drug dealers with marijuana, Dundas replied with an emphatic no.
“After what we’ve gone through to acquire these licenses and to ensure proper business and security and financial operations... we would be crazy to let that type of activity happen,” Dundas said.
Over a dozen individuals from the greater Boston area provided mixed opinions on the proposal during a public comment portion of the meeting. Among the proponents were veterans, senior citizens, and those struggling with chronic illnesses who claimed the dispensary would provide relief for their ailments. Others worried the dispensary could potentially lead to increased crime and drug usage.
McGovern criticized opposition to the dispensary.
“Whether it’s medical marijuana, or transitional housing for the homeless or affordable housing, I’m really getting frustrated with patting ourselves on the back for all the progressive values that we have in this city and then, when it comes down for individual neighborhoods to put skin in the game, say ‘I believe in this, but don’t put it near me,’” McGovern said.
Dundas and Hope touched upon security and costs in a presentation at the beginning of the hearing. According to Dundas, minors under the age of 18 would be unable to enter the below-ground dispensary. The cost for one “unit” from the dispensary would be roughly $10, while other products may cost up to $40.
The proposal will now move to the entire council for consideration, where councillors will vote whether to approve the proposal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 25, 2016, at 10:40 a.m.
More than 12,000 medical students, residents, and physicians from around the country have signed a petition originating at Harvard Medical School that calls for an end to the Step 2 CS exam, a portion of a mandatory test for all fourth year medical students.
Over three hundred Harvard Medical School affiliates joined the thousands of protesters in petitioning for the exam’s elimination as a way to reduce “unnecessary costs in the education process without negatively affecting patient care.”
The exam, initiated in 2004, consists of staged clinical patient interaction simulations, and is a requisite for acquiring a medical license. “The exam’s main purpose was and has been basically to see whether the student at this stage is able to one, speak English clearly and interact with patients,” Ronald A. Arky, a professor and advisory dean at Harvard Medical School, said.
Students said they are frustrated at how costly the exams are to take, given they are offered in just five testing sites around the nation: flight and hotel costs on top of an exam fee can cost roughly $1,275. Petition organizers argue that on top of the financial burden, the test is just plain unnecessary.
Carolyn L. Treasure, an organizer of the petition, which was first circulated earlier this month, called the exam “pointless,” and said that nationally, medical school students already face a student debt burden that averages to roughly $180,000 per graduate.
“Medicine emphasizes evidence. Ironically, there’s no evidence that this exam makes people better doctors,” she said.
Samia Osman, an organizer of the petition, argued that the exam is unnecessary because the vast majority of medical schools in the U.S. already have internal clinical skills exam; moreover, 95 percent of students pass the Step 2 CS exam on their first try.
Osman and Treasure said the redundancy of the test means it needlessly adds to medical school graduates’ financial burden, and some Harvard Medical School administrators agreed.
“This is a kind of exam that each medical school can certify its students for,” Arky said. “There’s no need to do this. The costs, as I mentioned, go up progressively each year.”
Nancy E. Oriol, Dean of Students at the Medical School, agreed the test is expensive both financially and in terms of time, and said it “uses up their resources.”
“I wish they had more time they were allowed to actually be learning more—you know, learning more, say in medical school that will sort of be of value as they go forward,” she said.
The petition, less than a month old, has spread very quickly among medical school students. Christopher R. Henderson, another organizer of the petition, said students used the power of social media and reached out to friends at other medical schools to spread the news.
“Within three days, we had a thousand people who signed. Within a week, we had like three thousand… Now, we have one in every 10 medical students in the United States in three weeks have signed this,” he said.
Currently, Osman said they’ve submitted a resolution to the Massachusetts Medical Society to remove the testing requirement in Massachusetts—the decision will come out in May—and other schools will also submit resolutions to their state societies. Meanwhile, a similar resolution was sent to the American Medical Association, which will make a decision in June, according to Osman.
“Since it’s a national body, it’s a way to get a unified voice from the medical community,” Osman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Come this June, a fresh face will join the ranks of the College’s Office of Student Life: Alex Miller, the University of Chicago’s Director of Student Involvement will serve as the College’s Assistant Dean of Student Life.
David R. Friedrich, the current associate dean of Student Life, was assistant dean from 2009 to 2013, but the position has remained vacant since his departure from that post. The College began a national search for the position in October 2015 following staffing changes in the Office of Student Life, and Friedrich led the search committee.
According to a College-wide email sent Thursday morning, Miller will work specifically to advance the College’s efforts to recenter social life in the 12 upperclassman Houses, increase programming across the Houses, and oversee advising for student organizations. Friedrich also currently oversees student groups and the College’s residential life.
“I definitely am interested in finding out where I could be most useful,” Miller said, from his office at the University of Chicago. “I do definitely recognize that Harvard has a distinctive residential experience. It’s going to be helpful kind of learning that culture.”
While one vacancy has been filled, the OSL still has a hole at its top; the administration has yet to find a permanent replacement for the Dean of Student Life position after Stephen Lassonde, the office’s previous occupant, abruptly left earlier this semester. Meanwhile, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 has taken up the role of interim dean of Student Life.
In a February interview with The Crimson, College Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila Thimba said although the search process for Lassonde’s replacement is in the early stages, the College hopes to find someone to occupy that role by the beginning of the next academic year.
A number of administrators said they were excited by the news of Miller’s appointment.
“We are really delighted that he has accepted this position, and we’re looking forward to having him join the Harvard community,” Friedrich said. “In terms of his role, he has a responsibility to support student activities and student leaders and their extracurricular involvement and leadership development opportunities.”
Friedrich added Miller’s experience working in similar roles will benefit the OSL, and Dingman cited similar excitement about the hire.
“I think it’s an awesome opportunity,” Dingman said. “Alex impressed the search committee with his very relevant experience, his wisdom, and his want.”
Resident Dean of Freshmen for Oak Yard Madeleine Currie also said she was “thrilled” with the hire, and is looking forward to working with him.
Miller closely echoed Currie’s sentiments.
“I’m excited to join the College,” he said.

Jesselyn Radack, attorney to whistleblower Edward J. Snowden, called on the U.S. government to prioritize privacy over security during the Harvard Human Rights Journal’s symposium on Thursday at the Law School.
The Journal, an online publication that features scholarly works in the field of human rights, organizes an annual symposium that brings together experts with a range of perspectives on a contemporary issue.
This year’s symposium, titled “Whose Security: Must the Security of Some Depend on the Insecurity of Others?”, sought to address the recent revelations of covert surveillance by the U.S. government.
During her keynote address, Radack, a former ethics advisor to the U.S. Department of Justice who calls herself a “whistleblower,” discussed her persistent efforts and struggles to expose human rights violations of the U.S. government.
“The United States is a democracy in decline,” Radack said. “In a democracy, the people are supposed to control the government, not the other way around.”
Radack rose to prominence after her exposure of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s interrogation of John Walker Lindh, a U.S. citizen who fought with the Taliban, without counsel in 2001.
During Thursday’s discussion, which was moderated by Law School professor and former Democratic presidential candidate Lawrence Lessig, Radack recounted the opposition she faced inside and outside the Department of Justice as she sought to reveal its ethical breaches.
After resigning from her position as a result, Radack said she has since become a voice for notable whistleblowers, including Snowden and Thomas Drake.
The symposium sought to reframe the debate on the relative importance of human rights  versus national security, according to Law School student Roi Bachmutsky, who co-chaired the symposium.
“We wanted to take the next step and ask, ‘Whose security are we really protecting, by what means, and whose security pays the price by protecting this first group’s security?’” Bachmutsky said.
The symposium featured two panels that brought together experts in different fields of human rights law. The first panel, titled “Police Violence against Ethnic/Racial Minorities,” sought to address over-policed areas, featuring panelists who specialize in litigation in various countries. The second panel, “Critical Issues on Material Support in Refugee Law,” explored the legality of national security justifications for limiting refugee entrance into a country.
“People don’t feel empowered to use the human rights system to make their demands, said panelist Meena Jagannath, a co-founder of the Community Justice Project, Inc. “They feel confined to the U.S. legal process.”

University President Drew G. Faust stuck to her guns Thursday at the United States Military Academy, emphasizing the importance of the liberal arts to a crowd of about 800 cadets and faculty members in West Point, N.Y.
Faust’s recent trip reinforces her support of the U.S. military. In 2011, under Faust’s leadership, Harvard officially recognized the Navy Reserve Officers' Training Corps program, ending a decades long detente with the program that began in the 1960s, when Harvard terminated its relationship with the military amidst student protest about the Vietnam War. Harvard also rekindled a relationship with Army ROTC, a program that trains undergraduate students to become military officers, in 2012.
Undergraduate students study at West Point to prepare for a career as an officer in the Army. Publicly funded, the Military Academy has produced a string of prominent generals and national leaders.
Introducing Faust, David Harper, an English and philosophy department head at West Point, praised Harvard’s president for her role in mending the long-troubled relationship between the two powerhouses.
“President Faust was instrumental in reinstating Navy and Army ROTC programs at Harvard,” Harper said.
Faust, in her lecture on “Leadership and Literature,” urged the cadets to study the liberal arts, arguing that the training a humanities degree provides is indispensable in the field of battle. She praised the selective military academy for its role in training future leaders, and added that the military is one of the few institutions that the public still trusts.
“Where there is no rulebook, turn to philosophy, to history, to anthropology, to poetry, and to literature. Take the wisdom and inspiration of the great thinkers and leaders who went before you, and then create your own,” Faust said.
Several members of Faust’s family served in the military, and her great-grandfather—a World War I general and U.S. senator—graduated from West Point in 1883.
Faust also quoted historical figures including George S. Patton, Frederick Douglass, and Winston S. Churchill, all of whom she said used the “interpretive and empathetic power of words.”
While she was on campus, Faust also ate in the West Point dining halls and met with professors and students at the school.

The total number of confirmed mumps cases at Harvard has risen to 16, and now nearby Tufts University and Boston University are starting to see their own cases of the virus.
Harvard’s total number of confirmed cases has risen three from the most recent figure, according to a report from the Cambridge Public Health Commission. Furthermore, students from multiple athletic teams are in self-isolation for “presumed cases of mumps” according to Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira.
While Harvard first confirmed the presence of mumps on campus three weeks ago, the virus has since spread to other colleges in the area, with two confirmed cases at Tufts and three at Boston University.
There have been 30 total cases of mumps in Massachusetts since January 1, according to state officials.
Anita M. Barry, the director of the Infectious Disease Bureau in the Boston Public Health Commission said that though the Commission had vague theories about how the virus could have spread, transmission was generally difficult to trace.
“When you start to interview cases and you try to get them to backtrack 25 days from when they first noticed the onset of swelling in their face... it’s hard to do,” Barry said. “For the most part, we have not been able to identify one-on-one spread.”
Tufts spokesperson Patrick Collins wrote in an email that Tufts health officials have isolated the students with mumps. BU spokesperson Colin D. Riley said one of the cases was confirmed before the school’s spring break, and two during or after break.
As other schools begin to deal with their own cases of mumps, Harvard is working to isolate and house its infected students.
The Harvard Inn has been used to house quarantined students, and residents of the Inn expressed concern that they were not notified beforehand. Dudley House Assistant Dean Christopher M. Gilbert sent a recent email to residents giving them the option of moving into upperclassman Houses “to help provide extra space at the Inn for Harvard College students who may need emergency housing this term.”
Gilbert said the students who move would be contributing to “the College’s proactive response to mumps.”
“This is not, however, the direct result of new cases,” Gilbert wrote in an email. “Instead, The College wants to ensure we are well-prepared to respond appropriately in the future depending on how the situation unfolds.”
Gilbert’s original email to residents noted the plan would not be put in action until respondents indicated enough interest. Rachel Francklyn ’17, a visiting student living in the Inn, said she had mixed feelings about the option to move.
“On the one hand it would be kind of nice to get the Harvard House experience,” Francklyn said. “But this late in the semester, it honestly just seems like a bit of a hassle.”
Mumps appears to be spreading at Harvard and among the Boston area student population, and Barry said her office is working with colleges to make sure students are appropriately quarantined. Barreira also said Harvard has been coordinating with other local schools, as well as with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Cambridge Public Health Department.
Mumps is transmitted through salivary exchange, or respiratory droplets, fairly large particles that exit people’s mouths and noses when they shout, cough, or forcefully expel air in some other way.
The roots of the mumps outbreak are still uncertain to Barry despite her office’s investigation. Still, she said a likely source of Harvard’s strain of mumps could be from St. Anselm college in New Hampshire—which had two confirmed cases of mumps this February—due to potential interaction between sports teams.
Many students who contracted the virus at Harvard had already been vaccinated against the disease, but Barry said the vaccine is fully effective just 88 percent of the time.
“The schools in Boston, and frankly most of the colleges, universities, and other schools in our area are very good about making sure that people who require those immunizations have had them,” Barry said. “The most likely explanation is that there were some people in whom the vaccine did not induce a protective response as we would have liked.”
Barry said the dense population of a college campus makes it easier for mumps to spread, so geographic separation over the summer would slow transmission.

Students, faculty, and Cambridge and Boston residents celebrated Nowruz, the traditional Iranian New Year, at the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Thursday evening.
Nowruz, which celebrates nature, occurs each year at the vernal equinox. At Thursday’s event, dozens of attendees gathered to socialize, enjoy live performances, and learn about Persian culture. The occasion was titled “Nowruz 1395,” which represents the 1395th year in the Persian calendar. 
The celebration, jointly organized by the Harvard College Iranian Association, the Harvard Iranian Students Association, and the Persian Caucus, featured traditional music, dance, and a speech on Persian poetry by Justine K. Landau, assistant professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.
Upon entering the venue, attendees were greeted with a Haft-Seen table, which features an elaborate arrangement of seven symbolic items that all begin with the letter seen, or ‘s’, in the Persian alphabet.
According to Sam Sinai, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Haft-Seen is “equivalent to the Christmas tree.”
“Where people use [the tree as a symbol of Christmas], Haft-Seen is what Iranians use as a symbol of Nowruz,” he said.
Landau highlighted that Iranians are not the only people that celebrate the holiday.
“It’s celebrated in many other countries, by Iranian people, by different ethnicities and religions and nationalities,” she said. “It’s celebrated throughout the Middle East and Central Asia.”
Several attendees said they enjoyed spending the evening together as a close group.
“We normally celebrate Nowruz because there is a very closely knit Iranian community in the Boston area,” said Shadi Saraf, an Iranian student at Bentley University who attended the event. “So, everybody knows somebody and they just gather.”
According to Sinai, Nowruz, which marks the beginning of festivities that last 12 days, is the most important holiday for Iranian-Americans.
“It’s sort of like our Christmas to New Year’s period,” he said. “It is an excuse to bring together the Iranian community of Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concerned that the prevalence of sexual assault among BGLTQ students has been misrepresented, six BGLTQ student groups from across Harvard sent an email to University President Drew G. Faust asking her to clarify the results of last semester’s survey about campus sexual assault.
 The email asks for more specific data about the rate of sexual assault among BGLTQ students and clarifications about how the survey categorized students by sexuality and gender. The groups’ requests surface more than two weeks after a University-wide task force called for additional resources dedicated to the prevention of sexual assault among students identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, and questioning. Specifically, the report recommends more resources for BGLTQ students at Harvard’s graduate schools.
All six of the students groups that signed the email are graduate student organizations, namely Harvard Law School Lambda, Harvard Law Queer & Trans People of Color, Harvard Business School LGBT Student Association, LGBTQ at Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, LGBTQ Policy Journal at Harvard Kennedy School, and Queer Ed at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. In their email, the groups also copied Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow.
Last year, Harvard, along with 26 other schools and the Association for American Universities, conducted a survey about sexual assault on their respective campuses.  The results, released in September 2015, revealed a higher prevalence of sexual assault among students identifying as LGBAQN—a term the survey used to describe lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, asexual, and “not listed” students.
According to the AAU report, 17.9 percent of LGBAQN undergraduate females reported nonconsensual contact involving physical force or incapacitation during the 2014-2015 academic year, compared to 12 percent of straight undergraduate females. Among LGBAQN undergraduate men, the rate of nonconsensual penetration and sexual touching was 10.9 percent, nearly eight percent higher than straight males during that time period.
Four percent of LGBAQN graduate or professional school women reported nonconsensual sexual contact involving physical force or incapacitation during that time period, compared to 2.9 percent of LGBAQN graduate or professional school men.
The groups praise portions of the AAU survey’s methodology, including the number of gender options provided and the breakdowns of responses for “Transgender, Genderqueer or non-conforming, Questioning, Not Listed” students. But, they express concern that certain questions and categories may have failed to “fully capture the range of BGLTQ individuals’ experiences.”
The letter expresses concerns about the rate of response among “Transgender, Genderqueer or non-conforming, Questioning, Not Listed” students.  The survey indicates that “there were not enough respondents in the TGQN group to generate reliable estimates.” The groups also note that students’ gender identities or presentations at the time they took the survey may differ from when they were assaulted.
“Going forward, we hope that the data obtained in this survey can help make future surveys and efforts to address sexual assault even more inclusive,” the email reads.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote Faust will soon respond to the student groups’ correspondence.
“As she indicated in accepting the Task Force recommendations, we all have much more to do together to prevent sexual assault.  The report highlighted the particularly disturbing rate of sexual assault in the BGLTQ community and it is clear that there is more to learn about that critical issue,” the statement reads. Neal also pointed to the creation of a new position in the Provost’s office dedicated to sexual assault prevention, a stipulation of the task force, as one way Harvard will better coordinate sexual assault prevention efforts.
Anna E. Joseph, a third-year student at Harvard Law School and co-president of Harvard Law School Lambda said she and other Law School students spearheaded the letter. They reached out to student groups at other Harvard schools, including the Kennedy School, the Business School, and the Graduate School of Education, to solicit a response from Faust, Joseph said.
“We thought we would get President Faust’s attention if we could make it a cross school coalition,” Joseph said. “So we reached out to other LGBTQ organizations and they were super supportive.”
Many of the University-wide task force’s recommendations, like annual sexual assault prevention training for every Harvard student, could take effect as early as next academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Sean Malone, the biggest lesson from his first NCAA tournament did not come during his team’s first-round loss to Nebraska-Omaha. It came after.
“Definitely the feeling in the locker room afterwards was the most important,” the junior forward said Wednesday. “You don’t want to have that feeling that your season is over, and I think that the majority of our guys in our locker room felt that last year.”
A year ago, a cloud of uncertainty hung over the Harvard men’s hockey team following its defeat in South Bend, Ind. The Crimson figured to lose its starting goaltender and top defensemen to graduation or eligibility constraints, and Jimmy Vesey fought back tears in his postgame presser before a media corps convinced that the Hobey Baker finalist had played his last game as an amateur.
Yet Vesey returned, and new stars emerged. A year later, No. 10/9 Harvard (19-10-4, 12-6-4 ECAC) finds itself back in the single-elimination national tournament, this time in a more familiar position against a more familiar foe.
The Crimson’s Friday night date with No. 6/5 Boston College at Worcester’s DCU Center will be the programs’ 124th meeting since 1919 but their first in an NCAA tournament. Harvard trails the all-time series, 45-73-5. The 73rd loss came in a 3-2 defeat in the Beanpot opener last February.
After falling short in their respective conference tournaments, both teams enter the 16-team bracket with something to prove.
Last Saturday in Lake Placid, a frustrated Malone watched from the stands as top-ranked Quinnipiac scored three power-play goals to push past Harvard for the ECAC title. After a three-goal performance in the Crimson’s quarterfinal sweep of RPI, cramps sidelined the Buffalo Sabres pick late in Harvard’s semifinal win over St. Lawrence and kept him out of the conference final.
Malone declined to discuss his injury but fully expects to be ready for Worcester, where he will likely rejoin senior Colin Blackwell and junior Luke Esposito on the Crimson’s second line.
“I think we definitely complement each other very well as a line,” Malone said. “We’ll see what the lines are for Friday, but I like playing with those guys for sure.”
Although Harvard ranks among the five least-penalized teams in the NCAA, coach Ted Donato ’91 has made discipline a point of emphasis this week. Eleven penalty minutes, including a five-minute boarding major to Esposito, helped sink the Crimson in Lake Placid. Untimely penalties also played key roles in the team’s most recent NCAA and Beanpot eliminations.
“Hopefully the Quinnipiac game was a little bit of an eye-opener for us in the sense that in one game, you’ve really got to handle your emotions, and you’ve got to stay out of the box, and you’ve got to not let the game get away from you,” Donato said.
With injured sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman likely to miss his third straight game, staying at full strength may be particularly important for Harvard against a high-powered Eagles offense. Last weekend, sophomore walk-on Thomas Aiken performed ably in Sherman’s place, although Donato might re-shuffle the combinations Friday.
Boston College (26-7-5, 15-2-5 Hockey East) also looks to make adjustments on defense heading into the weekend. In the Eagles’ 5-4 semifinal loss last Friday to eventual Hockey East champion Northeastern, junior goaltender Thatcher Demko made impressive saves, but the Eagles’ blueline, headlined by juniors Ian McCoshen and Steve Santini, labored.
Nevertheless, BC has history on its side.
The Eagles, who opened as the preseason national favorite, have won the last five regionals hosted in Worcester in each even-numbered year since 2006.
En route to collecting its 20th Beanpot title, BC’s defense proved stingy against Harvard, holding the Crimson to 23 shots on goal and six in the third period.
Eagles coach Jerry York, already having collected his 1,000th career win this January, enters the tournament in search of his sixth career NCAA title and fourth in nine seasons.
Perhaps Donato, who earned tournament MVP honors as a player in 1989 but is still in search of his first coaching win on the big stage, put it best on Wednesday:
“You know that you’re in the NCAA tournament if you have a chance to play against Boston College.”
By night’s end, the DCU locker rooms will tell the story.

The fourth quarter was winding down, and the Harvard women’s water polo team hadn’t scored for nearly a full period. In the span of three minutes, the Crimson had blown a 10-7 lead over No. 20 Hartwick; if the score held sway, the game was about to enter overtime knotted at ten.
Senior attacker Yoshi Andersen put an end to that idea, however. With a backhanded bullet, the co-captain shot past Hartwick’s backup goalie, sophomore Josette Santos, to put Harvard ahead with 1:17 remaining in the game. As the ball snapped the back of the net, the Crimson’s fans at Blodgett Pool exploded to their feet.
Sophomore goalie Cleo Harrington forced a crucial missed shot on the ensuing Hawks possession, as the Hartwick player arced the ball wide left in a close-range play, and No. 13 Harvard (19-4) forced one more turnover to seal the 11-10 victory over the visiting Hawks (13-8).
Andersen’s goal broke the scoring drought and gave the Crimson the conclusive lead in a game it never trailed.
“We ran a play that a lot of times we’ll run, because it gives us a lot of options at the end of the game,” Andersen said. “I guess they were focused on another part of the pool and so I was open in the middle. I locked eyes with [junior attacker Zoe Osborne], she passed me the ball, and then I just flung it back in there.”
The rest of the offense supplemented Andersen’s game winner with a frenzy of early goals. Junior attacker Melissa Balding scored three times to lead the Harvard attack, while sophomore attacker Sami Strutner tacked on another pair.
Freshman utility Nikki Daurio, freshman attacker Kristen Hong, junior attacker Michelle Martinelli, and senior attacker Zoe Osborne, who assisted on the winning goal, rounded out the scoring for the Crimson. Hong, the team’s leading scorer, also contributed a goal-saving steal.
On the other side of the pool, the defensive end did its part to help Harvard to another close win, by now a trademark of the team.
Harrington tallied eight saves, including one penalty shot, just days after receiving her third WWPA Division I/II Defensive Player of the Week honor of 2016. Several of the stops came in one-on-one situations. Admittedly she was helped out by a favorable goalpost—four Hartwick shots smacked the crossbar throughout the course of the game.
The Crimson came out of the opening sprint with sharp play, using accurate shots to take a 5-1 lead one possession into the second quarter. Balding and Andersen notched the first two scores in quick succession, providing an early cushion for the hosts.
“One of our team strengths is definitely that we come out to games fired up,” Andersen said. “I feel like that’s a pattern that we have. We fire each other up so we’re really in the zone as we go in there.”
The immediate lead had a long-lasting effect, as Hawks senior starting goalie Michaela Davies was pulled early in the second half.
After the first quarter, however, the Harvard offense slowed down, allowing the Hawks to pull back to 6-4 by halftime.
“We’re coming out of a long trip in California, short turnaround,” head coach Ted Minnis said. “I thought we came out and played pretty well in the first quarter. As the game went on, you saw that we kind of got a little tired.”
As the Crimson’s last regular-season opponent at home, Hartwick had been ranked as high as No. 11 this year. Harvard plays the Hawks once more during conference play next month, in addition to top-25 teams Michigan, Indiana, and Princeton.
While the Crimson traditionally has not beaten top-ranked teams on a consistent basis, this season marks a slight exception. Prior to Thursday, for example, Harvard was 3-28 against the Hawks.
“We’ll be able to put to the test all the things that we’ve been working on in this most recent phase in California,” Andersen said. “We had a lot of practice to change things, but now we have to stay focused and keep those changes in mind.”
The Crimson currently stands at No. 13 in the country, its highest ranking in program history. After Thursday night’s win, the team will likely climb further upwards.
“Being number 13 in the country is kind of cool,” Minnis said. “They’re pretty excited about that, but it’s not our goal. We haven’t started conference play—that’s really our focus.”
“Hopefully at the end, we’re still ranked really high.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing four of five games in the San Diego State Classic II, Harvard softball (9-11) limped back to Cambridge to kick off play in the Northeast against the University of Rhode Island (8-10).
The return to New England was not kind to Harvard, as Rhode Island emerged victorious, 4-2, in a low-scoring affair in Kingston, R.I.
“Midweek games are mental challenges,” captain Zoe Galindo said. “[W]e now know we can do better with facing them in the future.”
Despite solid outings from junior Taylor Cabe and freshman Kathleen Duncan in the circle, Harvard could not get anything going offensively against URI starter Becca Rogers.
The freshman, who is emerging as the ace of the Rhode Island staff, limited Harvard to two runs on six hits in a complete-game performance. The righthander struck out six and only allowed one free pass.
The game started off as a pitchers’ duel between Cabe and Rogers, but in the bottom of the fourth, URI strung together four hits to plate three runs.
A double and a bunt single put runners in scoring position for URI, and it capitalized with a pair of RBI singles and a sacrifice fly. Cabe managed to strand runners on first and second to escape the inning but not before URI jumped out to a 3-0 lead.
Harvard found itself trailing, 4-0, after a home run by URI junior Jenna Cubello in the bottom of the fifth.
However, the leadoff solo shot was the only run that the Rams managed against Duncan, who took over in the fifth. After a single, a walk, and a fielder’s choice, Duncan was able to escape the jam, stranding two runners in scoring position.
Harvard began a comeback in the next half inning, but Rogers managed to finish the game without surrendering the lead.
Despite two errors by Cubello at shortstop in the top of the seventh, Harvard only managed to push one runner across the plate.
After the errors, freshman Meagan Lantz doubled to drive in sophomore Dallas Hogan and advance freshman Rhianna Rich to third base. Down two runs with two runners in scoring position and two outs, senior Haley Davis grounded to short, but this time Cubello handled the ball cleanly and threw across the diamond for the final out of the game.
Rich, who leads the team with 26 hits through 20 games, had a rare off day at the plate. The El Segundo, Calif. native went hitless in four at bats in the leadoff spot.
Lantz and junior Savannah Bradley combined for four of Harvard’s six hits and drove in both of the team’s runs. Bradley homered for the second time this season in the sixth inning.
Juniors Catherine Callaway and Jillian Leslie recorded Harvard’s only other hits on the day. Callaway doubled to lead off the second inning for Harvard, her third of the season.
Cabe finished her start in four innings, giving up three earned runs and seven hits while striking out three. The loss dropped Cabe’s record to 6-3 on the season. Duncan came on in relief and limited the Rams to one run in two innings of work.
Lantz and sophomore Alexa Altchek stole a base each, but neither steal led to a run for Harvard.
The second game of the doubleheader, in which Harvard had a double-digit lead, was called due to darkness and declared a no contest.
Although this unfinished game has no bearing on the standings, the team is using it as a positive indication of Harvard’s potential.
“The second game. . . was how Harvard softball should always show up to play,” Galindo said. “That's what our offense is capable of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although men’s baseball junior pitcher Nick Gruener posted a 2.81 ERA over 16 innings with 11 K’s in two starts, Harvard spring break athletics featured another prominent team star whose performance  warranted recognition.
In eight starts for the No. 19 Harvard women’s water polo team, sophomore goalkeeper Cleo Harrington recorded a total of 91 saves and provided core defensive reliability to power the Crimson to a 7-2 record on its annual spring break California roadtrip. Harrington was rewarded with six wins, posted a career-high 20 saves in a victory over Azusa Pacific, and made several critical stops during Harvard’s six-game win streak. The California native also recorded totals of 13, 12, 11, 15 saves in four other games.
During the Crimson’s streak, Harrington’s goals-against average was 7.6. The Crimson offense averaged just under ten goals per game to back her up.
In losses to No. 20 SDSU and No. 11 UCSD, Harrington made 13 and nine saves, respectively, but posted double-digit save totals in a shootout against No. 25 CSUN and in a win over No. 13 UCSB. Harrington was also efficient, allowing only 4 and 5 goals in defensive grinds against No. 14 LMU and Santa Clara.
Harrington now has 182 saves, to go along with 15 assists and 6 goal-saving steals, on the season. With one non-conference and seven games of conference play still remaining, the sophomore has already surpassed the mark she set last season with 162 saves.
The team has placed a focus on defense throughout the season, and Harrington’s consistent performance have been a central component to the team’s 18-4 record. Senior captain Yoshi Andersen has attributed some of the success on improved communication in the pool, increased trust amongst the players, and more recently, taking good care of their physical state through icing, warm-ups, and warm-downs in the face of its busy nine-game stand.
In the one game that Harrington did not start, backup goalie freshman Sam Acker performed solidly, making nine stops while allowing through four goals against Redlands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in February, Jerry York was on to something.
“I think it’s my 22nd Beanpot,” the long-standing Boston College coach began.
“Of those, this was the most balanced field of major players in college hockey.”
Balanced was certainly right. For the first time in the history of the 64-year-old tournament, three teams—BC, Harvard, and Boston University—all entered the Beanpot ranked among the top 10 teams in the country. Northeastern was no slug either, unbeaten in its last eight contests.
Now a month and a half later, all four schools have their dancing shoes on. For the first time ever, the four Beanpot participants will participate in the NCAA tournament together, accounting for a quarter of the 16-team field.
But at least one won’t be dancing long.
In the nightcap of the Northeast Regional semifinals on Friday, York and the second-seeded Eagles (26-7-5, 15-2-5 Hockey East) will square off against the third-seeded Crimson (19-10-4, 12-6-4 ECAC), marking the first NCAA tournament meeting between the two sides, whose series has featured 123 games over the larger part of a century.
But meeting at long last in the Big Dance? That’s not the matchup’s most interesting facet. That distinction goes to the venue—Worcester’s DCU Center—located less than an hour away from both campuses.
“It’s a pretty special matchup we have here—two historic Boston schools,” Harvard junior Devin Tringale said. “And for it to be in Massachusetts as well… we should get a pretty good crowd of Tringales in the stands.”
A native of Medford, Mass., Tringale spent much of his childhood dreaming about what it is that young hockey players from the Bay State typically dream about: playing in a Beanpot. Tringale’s father would annually take Devin and his older brother to watch the tournament, and while Devin never pledged his allegiance to one of the four sides until committing to Harvard, he could not help but appreciate the BC brand of hockey.
“When I was younger, I really never missed a Beanpot,” Tringale said. “I just kind of loved Boston hockey, Boston College hockey especially…. When the recruiting process started to come along when I was in high school, that was definitely one of the things that was at the top of my agenda when I was looking for a prospective school—the Beanpot.”
One of six Crimson team members who call the Bay State home, Tringale is hardly the only Harvard skater who longed to become part of Beanpot lore. Massachusetts products Ryan Donato and Colin Blackwell, forwards in their first and fifth years, respectively, have also spoken about their appreciation for the tournament on multiple occasions.
But based on how the two forwards’ recruiting processes unfolded, their appreciation for the Beanpot might be surpassed by their respect for the tournament’s participants. Donato and Blackwell were each recruited by York and the Eagles before choosing to don crimson.
In fact, in an interview with The Salem News back in 2010, Blackwell said calling York to inform him of his decision was the toughest phone call he’s ever had to make. After all, when the St. John’s Prep star committed to Harvard during the fall of his junior year, BC was coming off its second national championship in the last three years.
But in the end, Blackwell determined Harvard was where he felt the most comfortable. And a few months later, Tringale followed suit, announcing his commitment to the Crimson in the spring of 2011. But the Lawrence Academy star’s road to Cambridge was far from over.
After graduation, Tringale played a year of juniors for the Valley Jr. Warriors, who were based in Haverhill, Mass. There, he commanded a spot on the first line alongside Brendan Collier and Ryan Fitzgerald, respective Charlestown and North Reading products.
These days, Collier plays for Northeastern, the latest winner of the Hockey East tournament championship. As for Fitzgerald, he’s the leading scorer for Hockey East’s regular-season champions—the Eagles of Boston College.
“I’ve known Fitzy for a while,” Tringale said. “We go pretty far back, and we’re pretty good friends…. He’s obviously very creative [and an] offensive guy. Pretty slippery. He’s a good talent and someone to watch out for, for sure.”
Fitzgerald, who also played with Tringale for the Boston Junior Bruins in 2011, has logged 22 goals and 22 assists this season. One of those helpers produced BC’s first goal, a strike by Ryan’s brother, Casey, in the Eagles’ 3-2 win over the Crimson in the Beanpot opener on Feb. 1.
The elder Fitzgerald plays on a line with freshmen Colin White and J.D. Dudek, two more New England natives on a team that features 10 players from Massachusetts and 13 from the region. In total, that makes 19 skaters who will get to experience the NCAA tournament in their home state this Friday.
But none will be paid more attention than the North Reading sharp-shooter not named Fitzgerald.
All eyes will be on Jimmy Vesey, a Charlestown native who later moved to North Reading, in what could be his final game for Harvard. That includes those of the Eagles who will aim to stop him, the Nashville Predators who want to sign him, and of course, the large number of Veseys whom Number 19 confirmed will be at the DCU Center watching his final NCAA tournament run.
In reality, Vesey’s first such run was hardly a run at all, as Nebraska-Omaha bounced the Crimson in its very first game of the tournament last March. Vesey did score, but Harvard ultimately fell, 4-1, to the Mavericks, who later punched their ticket to the Frozen Four in Boston.
Advancing to the next round may prove even tougher this time around. BC has won 11 of the last 12 meetings between the two sides, most recently after the Crimson let a 2-1 lead slip away in the Beanpot.
“We were left with a little bit of a pit in our stomach after that game,” Vesey said. “We’re definitely looking to get revenge this weekend.”
“Our guys want to prove that we have a good team and we can advance in the NCAA tournament,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “And what better way to do it than against one of the best teams in the country?”
The answer is simple. You do it in Worcester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Monday, Yale sophomore point guard Makai Mason shook the Ivy League by declaring for the NBA draft. Seniors declaring for the NBA draft is rare enough in the Ancient Eight; Mason’s decision, even coming on the heels of a 31-point outburst against fifth-seeded Baylor in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, is nearly unprecedented.
“We want to take advantage of the new rule, show people beyond the Ivy League what he’s capable of,” Mason’s father, Dan, told SI.
The new rule has already prompted changes across college basketball. Wednesday, Kentucky head coach John Calipari said that every member of his team was going to declare for the draft.
“It’s a true win-win for the student-athlete,” Calipari Tweeted late Wednesday afternoon.
Harvard has had players declare for the draft in consecutive years, with both Kyle Casey’13-’14 and Wesley Saunders ’15 putting their names in their senior seasons. While neither was drafted, both got summer camp invites (from the Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz, respectively). Saunders currently plays for the Austin Spurs and Casey plays for the Bakersfield Jam in the NBA D-League.
