After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“After a certain amount of arm-twisting by Republican leaders, [South Carolina Congressman Joe] Wilson did apologize for his behavior,” wrote New York Times columnist Gail Collins in her column last Friday. “Now we are going to move on to arguing about the apology.” 
Collins’s level-headed analysis is a welcome respite in the midst of the D.C. media storm following South Carolina Republican Joe Wilson’s barbaric heckling of President Obama last week. More embarrassing even than Wilson’s outburst is the way in which politicians, journalists, and commentators have responded to his unwarranted remarks.
The remarks themselves are already legendary. During Obama’s address to the joint session of Congress on health-care last Wednesday, Wilson uncouthly interjected “You lie!” in response to the president’s (largely truthful) debunking of the notion that undocumented workers would receive coverage under any of the Democrats’ five proposed health-care bills.
The breach of decorum was roundly condemned by all. But, predictably, Wilson promptly apologized to the White House that same night in a telephone call to Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Vice President Joe Biden. Obama publicly accepted Wilson’s apology the next day.
If it were not Washington, this apology would suffice. Wilson did, after all, apologize to the man whom he had wronged, and his apology was accepted. Unfortunately, Washington operates according to a very different set of rules than the rest of us.
Almost immediately, newly Obama-supporting Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania opined to liberal talk radio host Bill Press, “[Wilson] apologized immediately afterward but I don’t think that’s adequate... If an apology is the consequence of an outburst, I think we can expect more—that’s not a sufficient penalty. That’s not a sufficient price to pay. I’m not saying the guy should be kicked out of the House…but there ought to be some rebuke, reprimand, censure—something that will discourage that kind of conduct in the future. If you do that to the president, it’s open season.”
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer echoed this sentiment, proposing that Wilson be censured should he not apologize on the floor of the House of Representatives, as if it were the House that Wilson had wronged rather than the president to whom Wilson had already apologized. “I would like to see Mr. Wilson come to the floor and apologize to the House,” Hoyer told reporters.
Defending the Democrats’ overzealous persecution of the ill-mannered legislator, one Democratic aide told Politico, “If [Wilson] had just said he was sorry, nobody would be considering any of this.”
Surely, this is a truly novel notion. That an apology—an apology that was accepted, moreover—is not the equivalent of saying “sorry” must certainly be news to most.
In an act that has curiously been labeled “defiant,” Wilson responded to the escalating call for a second apology by stating that, “I have apologized one time. The apology was accepted by the president, by the vice president, who I know. I am not apologizing again.”
Wilson, ironically, is now the voice of reason. The fact of the matter is that he did already apologize, and it is simply silly for him to do so twice, especially to anyone other than whom he wronged. Right now, the country largely sympathizes with the Democratic perspective that Wilson was horrendously out of line, but should Democrats overreach—as they are wont to do—they are in danger of reversing the public’s sympathies.
The White House appears to have recognized this, though its less savvy House colleagues may not. When asked about the censure resolution, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said, “We take Congressman Wilson at his word that he apologizes for an outburst that he regrets.”
The president, once again, has chosen to rise above the fray and appear magnanimous as both his opponents and allies continue to squabble. Other Democrats should follow his example. Otherwise, they risk undoing all of the political good that Wilson’s zealotry unwittingly worked for them through an equally unreasonable zealotry of their own.

On the open sea, a helicopter approaches a cargo ship of Eastern European origin. Quietly, the chopper disgorges a team of elite commandos, arguably the best in the world, who quickly subdue the crew and remove weapons unlisted on the ship’s manifest. This may be familiar as the opening mission of a widely popular modern combat video game, featuring Britain’s elite Special Air Service. Yet this scene may have actually happened recently —with Israeli troops. 
Accounts differ on what really happened to “The Arctic Sea,” a ship with an Estonian, Latvian, and Russian crew that was nominally bound from Finland to Algeria with a cargo of harmless timber. Initial reports claimed masked men speaking accented English subdued, but did not harm, the crew; then the ship simply vanished. Russia has claimed, once the ship was found off West Africa, that there was no suspicious cargo on board besides the intended logs. Yet experts believe there was more to the ship’s hijacking than pirates seeking ransom.
More and more it seems likely that the ship was illicitly carrying powerful Russian anti-aircraft missiles to Iran. Russia has denied this assertion, but its position seems fishy. Whether Russia was coerced into taking back the missiles and covering the situation up or the missiles were forcibly removed, they would not be reported in the inventory following the ship’s recovery. Furthermore, the first whistleblower on the ship’s secret cargo, Mikhail Voitenko, a maritime expert and editor of the Russian maritime journal “Sovfracht,” has been fired and induced to flee to Istanbul after various threats. Voitenko’s forced exile only adds weight to his claim.
Having taken direct action, Israel apparently used diplomacy more to handle fallout from its actions.  Though the Israeli government announced and then maintained in the face of doubting by its press that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had spent a full day incommunicado last week because he was visiting a secret Israeli base, it has since admitted Netanyahu leased a private jet from an Israeli citizen and flew to Russia for the day, where he spoke in secret.
With the Russian government itself commenting only vaguely about whether Netanyahu met with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, it does not take Jason Bourne to unravel a common thread: Whether through its commandos or through strong-arm diplomacy, Israel appears to have stopped a shipment of missiles from reaching Iran. As the two countries work more closely together, it appears Israel avoided any post-op crisis and successfully negotiated with its much larger counterpart on the issue. Around the time the ship was discovered off the west coast of Africa, Israeli President Shimon Peres even declared victory of a kind, announcing that Russia would reconsider selling a variety of missiles types to Iran; in what seems Russia’s preferred form of disclosure, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev’s office neither confirmed nor denied the claim that Medvedev has promised to work with the Israelis on the issue.
This major development in international relations involving both Iran and Russia has thus far been completely devoid of American influence. Israel, not the United States, is aggressively pursuing results on Iran, even standing up to Russia. Considering the United States’s difficulties with similar issues, such as the planned anti-missile bases in Central Europe, Israel’s accomplishments are impressive.
Israel’s success, however, does not come without a new and growing risk:  preemptive action on a much larger scale. Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor of Israel has claimed “the clock is ticking” on negotiating with Iran about its nuclear program. According to Meridor, the United States and its Western allies have the chance to position Iran to stop its atomic projects, provided they apply the proper political and economic influence. 
What will happen if the traditional Western powers do not halt Iran’s progress in nuclear capability? The answer may lie in the bizarre story of “The Arctic Sea” and an unannounced, clandestine trip by an Israeli head of state to Moscow. Simply put, Israel has proven itself unafraid to take direct, dramatic action to keep Iran in check. If Israel will not hesitate in playing tough with a country as powerful and potentially belligerent as Russia, the West cannot assume it will hesitate to use a similar “shoot first, ask questions later” policy in the future.
The possibility that Israel will bomb an unrepentant Iran has been well documented. The Wall Street Journal has highlighted on its editorial page the potential crisis this may pose for the Obama administration, while the Los Angeles Times has featured an editorial arguing that Iran’s lack of cooperation in September could lead to a unilateral Israeli response in self-defense.
These claims are not as incredible as they might sound. The saga of “The Arctic Sea” makes it clear that Israel is not kidding around, nor is it waiting upon developments. Israel will protect itself first and then send politicians to smooth things over when the issue has been rendered a fait accompli. Hopefully the United States and the rest of the world heed the warning left on that abandoned ship.

Disillusioned liberals, take heart. On Labor Day, President Barack Obama appointed Ron Bloom—former United Steel Workers executive who has devoted much of his career to promoting worker ownership of the means of production—as his manufacturing czar.  Then again, this is the same Ron Bloom who holds a Harvard MBA and once served as an executive vice president of the investment bank Lazard Freres & Co. And no, he sees no contradiction between his business career and his pro-worker activism.
Nor should he. Bloom is a pioneer when it comes to worker buyouts, in which the employees of a faltering firm buy an ownership stake to prevent plant closings or job losses. The idea of an economy of worker cooperatives may seem utopian, and the notion of using the tools of modern finance to do so absurd. But Bloom and his mentor at Lazard, Eugene Keilin, helped prove it possible—and did so with no less than the largest airline in the nation: United.
Working as advisors to the pilots’ union, Keilin and Bloom orchestrated a buyout in which United employees, through their unions, bought a 55 percent stake in the company. The results were staggeringly positive. Worker grievances plummeted while the firm’s productivity and profit margins soared. Previous skeptics appeared to be swayed. BusinessWeek devoted a cover story to the success of worker ownership, including praise from sources as unlikely as a Merrill Lynch analyst and an executive at a rival airline.
United’s buyout was not a fluke. A 2000 Rutgers study showed that worker-owned companies experienced average employment and sales growth that was 2.3 to 2.4 percent higher than non-worker-owned firms. In other words, these companies grow to be on average a third larger than traditionally owned firms over the course of 10 years.
The benefits to workers are just as significant. A study conducted by Washington State University found that hourly wages at employee-owned firms were five to 12 percent higher than those at other firms and retirement benefits almost three times greater in value. Employee culture tends to improve in concert. For example, W.L. Gore, the worker-owned firm that manufactures Gore-Tex, has no formal “bosses” and is routinely ranked by Fortune as one of America’s best companies to work for.
The reasons for this success are clear enough. When workers own their own companies, they have an obvious incentive to protect their own salaries and benefits and to create a friendly work environment. But they also have an incentive to protect the profits and overall success of their employers. After all, ownership in a bankrupt firm is worthless. Thus, worker ownership results in firms where the needs of workers come first, but where necessary cutbacks can be achieved as well.
What, then, does Bloom’s appointment signal? His job encompasses a broad range of industries, from the steel mills he has helped organize in his position with the United Steel Workers to the Big Three automakers—Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler—in Detroit. Bloom and Keilin have already proven that worker ownership can work—since, before the United deal, they made their reputation by advising steel workers in buying out their employers.
But worker ownership is, if anything, more promising in the automobile industry. If the American car companies are to survive, some accommodation must be made between the United Auto Workers, whose eagerness to forestall cuts to retiree and current worker benefits has made it difficult for firms to keep down costs, and the Big Three automakers. Ford, to its credit, has admitted as much by negotiating a deal with the UAW in which Ford has more flexibility in paying retiree health benefits.
However, the heads of other firms, such as GM, have dismissed the possibility of similar deals. Moreover, the longer negotiations drag out between the union and automakers, the greater the danger of bankruptcy becomes. The answer, it seems, is some form of employee buyout. As Bloom himself has said, worker ownership is an ideal way to bring unions and management into a more constructive relationship. “Companies would come and ask unions to modify agreements in one way or another,” Bloom told The American Prospect’s Tim Fernholz. “If the union was strong, it would say ‘no,’ and if it was weak it would say ‘yes,’ but it would never engage in a problem-solving dialogue looking for solutions where both parties could get better off.”
It is too early to say if Bloom’s standing within Obama’s economic team will prove strong enough to start such a dialogue by facilitating more employee buyouts, in the auto industry and elsewhere. For the sake of our nation’s manufacturing workers—and, indeed, for the sake of our nation’s manufacturing companies—here’s hoping worker ownership finds a home in the current administration’s economic policies.

A gas main under Plympton Street cracked early Sunday afternoon, causing gas to seep into Old Quincy and the building to be evacuated for several hours.The gas concentration was low enough to not constitute a serious fire danger, according to officials at the scene, and the gas company, NSTAR, was present and actively monitoring gas levels soon after the leak was identified. The gas began filtering into the building through cracks in its foundation during the early afternoon yesterday, according to Cambridge Fire Department Deputy Chief Francis E. Murphy III. Outside Quincy on Plympton Street, the smell of gas was palpable throughout the afternoon.Although gas levels inside the building were not of immediate concern, turning electric appliances on and off in the building could have caused a fire to break out, Murphy said, but with the building evacuated, that risk was minimized.An NSTAR team excavated the gas main and plugged the leak by the evening.According to witness reports, the leak likely started at around 1:30 or 2:00 p.m., but students were not officially informed of the situation until 3 p.m. Most students, instead, resorted to quizzing fire-fighters on the scene for information.Harvard’s emergency messaging service remained silent throughout the afternoon.At the time that the evacuation was ordered in Old Quincy, there was no smell of gas inside the building, said Andres D. Uribe ’12, who was inside when the alarm sounded. While gas in its pure form is odorless, it is odorized before delivery to households.Gas levels in the basement of Old Quincy had begun to decrease by 3:30 p.m., Murphy said. The evacuation remained in place until 5 o’clock, when students were allowed to return to their rooms in Old Quincy. But Murphy said he was surprised to find students in their rooms yesterday afternoon at all.“Shouldn’t you be out partying on a day like this?” he asked.Murphy added that this weekend’s “torrential” rains likely contributed to the leak, as the precipitation could have created sink-holes around the gas main, which had allowed the gas to escape from a pre-existing crack. The gas then likely followed the newly-installed water main that feeds Old Quincy’s sprinkler system into the building.“The gas follows the path of least resistance,” Murphy said. “The soil around the recent excavation [for the water main] probably isn’t as compact as the surrounding soil.”Despite the leak, the House’s Field Day celebrations and opening convocations continued in the Quincy courtyard.Housemaster Deborah J. Gehrke, in full academic regalia, flourished the Quincy cane and admonished the gas leak that had threatened the ceremonies.“I expunge this gas leak from Quincy.”—Staff writer Elias J.

Harvard neurobiologist Florian Engert—known for his work on neural behavior in zebrafish—was awarded tenure in July in the department of molecular and cellular biology.A member of faculty since 2002, Engert has dedicated his time at Harvard to a unique way of studying neural activity that allows the researcher to observe all neurons in a functioning brain.“We look at how the brain processes sensory information—in our case, visual information—and what the brain does with that information in producing behavior,” Engert said. “The zebrafish are small enough that they fit into a high-powered microscope, so we can view the whole brain and see what the individual neurons are doing. We can see not only how the neurons are shaped, but how they function.”According to Andre G. V. Valente, who has worked in the Engert lab for five years, the recently minted professor is known for his supportive, accessible and extraordinary personality. Valente added that Engert runs a “help desk” to answer students’ questions and assist them with programming.“I think it’s very important and positive that Harvard give tenure to people like Florian, who do not have a ‘formal professor-like’ personality, but instead have the ability to get people together who truly enjoy science in a fun way, different from what you would normally expect,” Valente said.Before working at Harvard, Engert was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego, and University of California, Berkeley, studying tadpole sensory processing.“Professor Engert is a scientist of remarkable scope, having made important contributions to two distinct fields, visual system development and motor system function,” said Earth and Planetary Sciences Chair Jeremy Bloxham in a press release. “A highly creative researcher, his publications are consistently of the highest quality. He is also an outstanding teacher, a wonderful colleague, and a generous member of the neuroscience community.”Graduate student Eva Naumann, who has been a teaching fellow in Engert’s MCB 105 class, said that he breaks down “hardcore science” to explain it in a novel, engaging way. “He believes you should only do science if you enjoy it or not do it at all,” she said.—Staff writer Huma N.

Investigators found a female body yesterday evening inside a wall in the basement of the research facility where missing Yale graduate student Annie Le, 24, was last seen Tuesday morning.Officials could not confirm last night whether the remains belonged to Le, according to an e-mail Yale President Richard C. Levin sent to the community yesterday evening. An autopsy will be performed by the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, but police are assuming the body is Le’s, according to the Yale Daily News. The case has now been labeled a homicide investigation.Just yesterday, investigators retrieved bloody clothes in the ceiling of the research facility a couple blocks from the Sterling Hall of Medicine, where Le’s lab is located. Officials have yet to establish a link between the find and Le’s disappearance, as she was wearing different clothes that morning.According to the Yale Daily News, an unnamed source within the University’s police department said officials are currently analyzing the dried blood on the clothes, stating that it could be animal blood from experiments conducted in the research facility.Surveillance tapes show that Le, a pharmacology doctoral student from Placerville, Calif. was last seen entering the building at around 10 a.m. on Tuesday. Roughly three hours later, an unexpected fire alarm sounded, and the research facility was quickly evacuated.There is no record of Le leaving the building based on footage from some 75 security cameras stationed around the building, though Yale officials have said it could be difficult to pick out Le, who is 4-feet-11-inches, from the crowd during the evacuation. Her ID, money, credit cards, and purse were found in her office in the Sterling building.Le was to be married yesterday to Columbia University graduate student Jonathan Widawsky at the North Ritz Club in Syosset, N.Y. The wedding was called off shortly after her disappearance, and Yale students prayed for Le’s safe return at The University Church earlier yesterday.Le’s family and fiance are cooperating with the investigation, and more than 100 law enforcement officials from four different agencies including the New Haven Police Department, the Yale Police Department, the Connecticut State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are involved in the case.Anyone with information pertaining to Le’s disappearance is asked to call the FBI tip line at 1-877-503-1950.—Staff writer June Q.

Entering her freshman season, standout basketball recruit Jasmine Evans hoped to follow the advice of her coach and provide a defensive presence that would help the Harvard women’s basketball team regain its position atop the Ivy League.
Plans, however, changed quickly. Just two weeks after arriving in Cambridge, Evans suffered a torn ACL that will keep her off the court for the year.
Evans was taking part in a one-on-one defensive drill when her right leg was caught between the legs of a teammate as she powered to the basket for a layup.
“All I remember was hearing a pop and then I fell to the floor,” Evans said. “It sounded like someone just took my bone and tried to break it in half.”
She quickly added with a laugh, “I didn’t cry.”
When Evans went to the trainer to find out the results of her MRI, however, it was harder to keep back the tears.
“It was kind of hard to take in,” said Evans, who never suffered a serious injury during her time at Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto, Calif.
Evans, who received interest from some of the top basketball programs in the country, including Stanford, led Gunn to a 29-2 record and her school’s first league championship during her senior season. A 5’9 combo guard with quick feet, stifling defense—she averaged 4.5 steals per game near the end of her senior year in high school—and a remarkable ability to finish at the basket, Evans showed promise in early workouts with her new team at Harvard.
“I think she’s incredibly athletic,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “In the one cardio workout we had, she led the team.”
With the injury, however, Evans will have to look for different ways to contribute this season. Although no plans have officially been announced for the remainder of the season, Evans has spent the past few days helping her teammates at practice.
“We formally call her Coach Evans [now],” Delaney-Smith said.
Both Evans and Delaney-Smith believe that positives can be drawn from the situation. In addition to getting a firm grip on the Harvard offense, Evans hopes to become a stronger and smarter basketball player from watching her teammates.
“I think mentally it will prepare me better for tough games,” Evans said. “I know I’ll have to go out and play my hardest because, after an injury like this, you can’t complain about anything else.”
The Palo Alto native chose to leave her hometown for Cambridge, much to the chagrin of her friends back home, who had hoped to continue to watch her play in California. Evans, however, knew Harvard was the right choice after her official visit in October of last year, when she met the coaches and other players. Evans, a prospective biology or bioengineering concentrator, felt Harvard would give her a better chance to focus on academics.
The Crimson coaching staff did have one major selling point that had nothing to do with academics—Harvard’s famous upset of Stanford during the opening round of the 1998 NCAA Tournament. The win remains the only time a 16-seed has ever defeated a one-seed in NCAA Tournament history.
Unsurprisingly, the Stanford coaching staff kept quiet about the game.
Evans hopes that her injury will not prevent her from following in the footsteps of a different Palo Alto native. Men’s basketball co-captain Jeremy Lin, who also grew up in Palo Alto, attended Evans’ rival high school. Evans remembers cheering for Lin as he led Palo Alto High School over the favorites from Matter Dei in the 2006 CIF Division II State title.
With an impending surgery and a season on the bench awaiting the freshman guard, Evans will look to come back stronger for her sophomore season. On top of making sure her knee is healthy, Evans hopes to improve her conditioning while maintaining her speed and defensive prowess.
“Despite this small setback, we expect Jasmine to have a great career,” Delaney-Smith said.

Age certainly does not guarantee victory. Just ask sophomore Holly Cao and freshman Hideko Tachibana, who competed in a Crimson-clad final in the Flight A women’s tennis championship at the William and Mary Invitational over the weekend.  After a string of tough matches against a variety of highly-ranked opponents, the athletes faced one another for the title. Tachibana emerged as the victor, defeating Cao, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3.However, this was ultimately a team victory for Harvard. Cao and Tachibana showed that they could fill the shoes of graduates Beier Ko and Laura Peterzan, the top two players in the Crimson’s lineup last season. This year’s team is a young one, with four freshmen, four sophomores, two juniors, and no seniors. But in the mind of both Tachibana and Harvard coach Traci Green, this characteristic will not hurt the team’s competitiveness. “A young team is a good thing,” Tachibana said. “We have a couple years to bond and build on one another.”“This is a huge opportunity for young players to step up and take a lead role,” Green said. “It was definitely a big loss, losing Ko, an All-Ivy player, and Peterzan, our former captain and great Ivy talent, but our young players, especially freshmen, really stepped it up this first weekend.”Harvard controlled the tournament last weekend, coming away with five finalists and three champions. The performances of Cao and Tachibana highlighted the weekend. “Holly and Hideko amazed me with their grit and really showed what Harvard’s women’s tennis is all about, having to play in temperatures that got up to 95 degrees and in multiple three-set matches,” Green said.The road to the finals was certainly not an easy one for either athlete. Cao defeated Lauren Sabacinski of William and Mary, 6-3, 6-4, in the first round. In the quarterfinals, she downed the No. 98 player in the nation, Yevginya Stupak of East Tennessee State University, 6-1, 6-0. In the semifinals, Cao defeated top-seeded and No. 36 Michaela Kissel of Marshall, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. “They were difficult matches, but I went out to play my game and came away with a win,” Cao said. On her side of the draw, Tachibana beat Erin Clark of Richmond, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, Elizabeta Zaylsiva of Winthrop, 6-2, 6-4, and Kateryna Yergina of Virginia Commonwealth University, 7-5, 3-4, ret. Though she did not face a ranked challenger, Tachibana took down opponents who had previously defeated players ranked 73rd and 107th in the nation. The three-set match in the finals between Cao and Tachibana was equally as competitive as the road each took to get there. Cao took the first set in a tiebreak, but Tachibana responded by winning the remaining two sets, 6-4, 6-3.  This opening tournament, Tachibana’s first college competition, was, in her mind, “pretty good.” Although humble about her win, the Texas native, whose older brother is on the tennis team at Rice, is ecstatic about the team this season.“Holly is a really, really good player,” Tachibana said. “It was a tough match and very competitive....I really like the team at Harvard, and can’t wait for the regular season.”  Cao, originally from Australia, spent the majority of last year injured, and sees this tournament, and season, as a chance to make a comeback.   “During my freshman year I was injured, which obviously disrupted my training schedule,” Cao said. “But I went home over the summer, and worked out with my coach, focusing on fitness and just trying to get healthy.”She, like Green and her teammates, saw this weekend as a true team bonding experience, despite the fact it was an individual competition.“There was an individual, but team mindset,” Green said. “The girls were able to bond and get more familiar with each other, while showing their stuff on the court.”Though the spring season is months away, this past weekend’s performance by Cao and Tachibana is a good sign for the future of Harvard women’s tennis.

The Harvard sailing team opened its year-round campaign last weekend in rather familiar waters, as the Crimson traveled to four regattas throughout New England. With the graduation of many key contributors from last season, Harvard is looking to use these early-season fall events to ready itself for the championship portion of its schedule in the spring and summer.“The seniors last year were huge assets to the team,” junior crew Grace Charles said. “They provided great leadership and we will miss them, but we have many freshmen this season ready to step up. We weren’t able to have a preseason this year with school starting earlier, so the freshmen are going to have to adjust quickly.” The women’s squad provided the highlight of the Crimson’s first weekend of competition, finishing fourth at the inaugural Women’s Antonia Schuman Trophy, hosted by MIT.The co-ed team split its squad between the Harry Anderson Trophy, hosted by Yale, and the Central One Series regatta, hosted by Tufts, where Harvard took home ninth- and seventh-place team finishes, respectively. A freshman co-ed contingent also competed at the one-day Northeastern Invite at Boston University over the weekend.“Our results were alright for our first weekend of competition,” Charles said. “We have three juniors studying abroad this fall, so we are going to have to balance everything a bit more until they return in the spring.”WOMEN’S ANTONIA SCHUMAN TROPHYCompeting in its home waters on the Charles River, the Crimson women’s squad captured fourth place in both the A and B division of racing this weekend, leading to a fourth-place team effort overall.In the A division, second-year skipper Emily Lambert, along with sophomore crew Alexandra Jumper, placed in the top five of the 12-school field 12 times, placing in the top three on eight occasions and winning four of the 24 division races on the weekend.“It was nice to be sailing at home, and our Saturday went really well,” Jumper said. “We were in first place after the first day. There were some strange breeze directions on Sunday, as the wind was really shifty, but we are confident about the team this year and were happy with our effort this weekend.”Senior captain and skipper Liz Powers and sophomore crew Marie Appel competed together in the B division, where the pair won seven contests, including five out of seven races at one point.Harvard finished just 19 points out of the lead, finishing with a final tally of 234 points on the weekend. The regatta was won by the Jumbos from Tufts, who edged out the Connecticut College Camels by a single point.HARRY ANDERSON TROPHYThe Crimson co-ed squad’s more experienced sailors made the trip to New Haven this weekend, where they finished a respectable ninth in a field of 20 teams at the Harry Anderson Trophy.Racing in the A division, junior captain and skipper Alan Palmer, along with Charles, placed eighth. While the middle-of-the-pack finish might not have been exactly what the pair was hoping for coming into the weekend, their three top-three finishes in three of the first four contests, including a victory in the fourth race of the regatta, show that the duo can compete with New England’s best teams.“Our first few races were definitely encouraging,” Charles said. “We tailed off on the second day, but we can use those races to show us what we need to work on in the future.”Junior skipper Teddy Himler and senior crew Michelle Konstadt finished 13th in the B division of racing, with a pair of top-three efforts.Harvard finished the weekend with a total of 235 points, well back of the host Bulldogs’ mark of 143, which earned Yale the overall team title on the weekend.CENTRAL SERIES ONECompeting on Upper Mystic Lake, the Crimson co-ed squad finished seventh in a field of 16 at the Central Series One regatta.Junior skipper Colin Santangelo and freshman crew Sarah McCuskee paced Harvard’s efforts in the B division, where the duo placed fifth and won two of the first three races. Second-year skipper Brendan Kopp and freshman skipper Sam Millham took turns teaming up with sophomore crew William White to take home seventh place in the A division, with a lone victory on the weekend.—Staff writer Thomas D.

It's September, and the campus is crawling with recruiters looking to lock down the next generation of financial movers and shakers. In the spirit of the season, FlyBy deployed a couple of the humanities concentrators that populate its ranks to give an outsider's introduction to what these recruiting events are all about. This series contains our observations of the world of fast money, fine suits, and finger foods otherwise known as financial recruiting.
They say there are parts of the country where people have never heard of financial sector recruiting. Cambridge isn't one of those places: or at least, not the stretch of brick sidewalk between FlyBy's lair on Plympton Street and the stately Sheraton Commander, where we were due to have our first date with the nation's economic destinymakers. Wearing shirts and ties and walking along Garden Street beside a be-suited Industry Expert, retained specially by FlyBy for the event, our blogging correspondents found themselves subject to the once-over of a slick-looking Asian man wearing a shoulder bag, who raised his eyebrows in knowing recognition.
"Blackstone?" he asked.
Oh. Yeah. Blackstone, indeed. The Blackstone Group, even, for those in the know. The kingpin of private equity. FlyBy's correspondents, both Classics concentrators, had little if any idea what private equity was, or what this sable stone was meant to connote. But that was what the Industry Expert was for. With hundreds of hours of summer investment banking experience in his back pocket, the Expert was solicited to give the necessary background briefing, advise on wardrobe and generally translate the bramble of acronyms—BAAM, 3(a)9, EBITDA—that infest recruiters' slideshows. It was the Expert who counseled against wearing mesh shorts to the Sheraton. It was the Expert who was expected to know who Blackstone was, and how to deal with Mr. Shoulder Bag's query.
The Expert was not impressed by his role. "The more I think about it, the more I'm sort of worried about anyone writing this," he reminded FlyBy's correspondents in an e-mail the day before the big Blackstone kickoff. "If we tool on these firms, the writer of them could potentially be blacklisted... in case they ever want to go work there."
But braced by a promise of anonymity and by an immutable love for the financial services industry, the Expert was retained, and did deliver the skinny on Blackstone during the brisk walk along Garden Street. Private equity, buying up huge amounts of debt, emerging out of the debt bubble, etc., etc. We can't claim to have understood the whole thing. But the bottom line? "Blackstone sort of represents the thing that caused the financial crisis," the Expert told us.
Concerned for his health, a FlyBy correspondent noted that somebody had reportedly fainted at a Bain information session the previous week. The Expert wrote it off to the standing-room only situation facing the crowds. "People actually wanted to work for Bain," he said jadedly. "People wanted to work for Blackstone like two years ago."  Word on the presentation after the jump.
By that point we were closing in on the Sheraton Commander, where the attendant behind the counter took in our attire and waved us to the left without asking why we were there. We entered a stately reception area—serviced by five chandeliers; framed cushions along the walls. Inside, the 90 chairs arrayed in front of the projector were filled. Thirty or so more stood along the wall. Roughly three-quarters of those in attendance were men. Blackstone was looking to hire 40 new analysts, Senior Managing Director John Studzinski told the crowd.
"Harvard and Wharton are the two major programs of schools that fill our analyst program," Studzinski said. "One person this past year sneaked in from Yale, and we're monitoring him very carefully." He then informed the audience that "some schools produce people that are more quantitatively apt than others," before deciding to rein himself in a little, remarking that he had "no desire to see [his remarks on Yale] in tomorrow's press" and that he hoped nobody had any YouTube devices.
FlyBy's correspondents reached for their notebooks.
More fun and games when a presenter on Private Equity, following Studzinski, shared with us that "When I started in this business 16, 17 years ago, the first time I got to wire $500 million I found that quite exciting." We understood the sentiment: sometimes our moms wire us $200 for books at the beginnings of terms. That's always a heady day.
By this time we had been in the room for over a half hour, leaning against the wall. The powerpoint, while detailed, was nearly incomprehensible, and things were showng no signs of speeding up. Even our Expert was having trouble staying focused."Nobody ever does presentations like this," he told us, looking at the mass of text on the projector screen. "It's because they actually do stuff, but good God this is horrible."
Next up was the stern managing director of the real estate division, who explained that Blackstone was primarily invested in hotels and office properties. Furnishing a prominent example of a hotel conversion gone very right (read: very profitably), this somewhat bored director set forth what would be the take home message of the entire presentation before returning to checking his BlackBerry against the wall: "There's nowhere to hide in our group. You're thrown into the deep end from day one, and it's expected that you'll enjoy that type of environment." That's one way to emphasize the small size and close working environment of your staff, we suppose.
The only respite from the industrial argot and ominous exhortations came in the form of John Studzinski, who took to the fore again apparently to lighten the mood and explain his particular realm of expertise: acquisitions and mergers. In explaining the key to success within Blackstone, Studzinski cited "the three D's: data, details, and deadlines." To clarify exactly what this meant in terms his audience might appreciate, Studzinski stated that the analyst's job entailed "a lot of boring shit work."
Almost an hour deep, a powerful indictment from the Expert: "This is a Death March. This is horrible."
With students trickling out, apparently feeling the effects of the death march, the final presenters took the podium. One Flip Huffard, a Captain America-looking type, exuberantly professed that the economic downturn put his division, Restructuring and Reorganization, squarely in the limelight. "We live for these days," he declared before essentially rehashing the presentation of Studzinski, whose division does approximately the same thing, only on an international level.
Finally, the presentation drew to a close, and the slumped over masses, exhausted by the lengthy presentation, seemed to rejuvenate with the imminent prospect of getting to schmooze with these elites of industry. People milled about shaking hands, exchanging business cards, and generally asking inane questions in the hope that something they said might be remembered. FlyBy wanted to know what these people were really in the business for, so we hung around a bit to hear what was being discussed.
The answer came in a capitulation from Studzinski, who explained to a Chinese student overzealously prodding him as to how she could become a partner in his company: "People are very interested in making money; in that respect, it's very Chinese." We probably could have figured the first part, but who would have thought to make such an apt comparison?
To our great dismay, no food was served prior to, during, or after the presentation. Maybe at our next meeting.

After last year’s drug-related shooting caused a nationwide media storm, Harvard administrators have been doing their best to minimize public scrutiny and put all those “I can’t believe those Harvard kids smoke pot!” remarks to rest.
In an attempt to crack down on illegal drug activity, the administration is looking to increase the severity of consequences for students caught with illegal substances, especially marijuana. According to the “Drugs and Alcohol” section of the FAS Student Handbook, students found using illegal substances will be issued a referral letter and are required to meet regularly with consultants from Alcohol & Other Drug Services (AODS).
But a new intervention program has recently been introduced to the Harvard campus as a extension of further disciplinary action and drug use prevention. The electronic THC Online Knowledge Experience, or e-TOKE, is an online “assessment and feedback tool designed to reduce marijuana use among college students,” according to the e-TOKE website. Sound familiar? Welcome to Alcohol EDU II: Weed Edition.
Designed by professors from San Diego State University, e-TOKE is currently already being used on 400 campuses nationwide. Harvard hopes to join the ranks of these dope-diminishing schools, convinced that the intervention programs implemented by AODS and this new online tool will provide “structured intervention, particularly for those students who may not view their substance use or related negative consequences as problematic,” as stated in the Student Handbook.
E-TOKE claims to motivate students to steer away from marijuana use through social norms and other encouraging data and information. A sample report on the e-TOKE website shows primary marijuana use at “Fictional University” to be centered around males, freshmen, non-athletes, and non-Greeks. Interesting social norm implementation, no?
Will making burnt-out students complete a 15-minute survey deter them from marijuana use? Can’t wait to see the little green pie charts for “Harvard University.”

Quadlings no longer have to wait “16 in” until the next shuttle. The shuttleboy text message system – a lifesaver for the many quad residents who have misplaced their shuttle cards on a rainy day – has changed its text message lingo. The once bootleg responses that abbreviated minutes as “in” instead of “min” and often ended with an ellipsis of four periods has started to respond to texts with far more normal parlance.
For example: “The next shuttle leaves in 28 min at 9:05pm and then at 9:30pm, 9:45 pm, and 10:10 pm.”
Granted, the text that prospective travelers have to send to shuttleboy is still far from intuitive. “For Shuttleboy SMS, text ‘SBOY A B’ to 41411, where A and B are the first 3+ letters of two stops!” directs the shuttleboy website. Such directions result in “Sboy boy qua” to get from Boylston Gate to the quad, phraseology that sounds like Avril Lavigne dreamt it up after reading Waiting for Godot.
Oddities aside, however, the normal responses are an improvement over the previous sign-off.
Happy trails….

Warning to all River House residents: don’t do your laundry tomorrow between 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., or all of your whites may turn a lovely rust color. The FMO Fire Group will be performing the annual check of Harvard’s fire hydrants tomorrow evening, and in doing so they may knock some of the silt at the bottom of sedentary pipes back into the river houses’ waterways.
The silt – “That’s just normal sediment. Pieces of rust from the pipes themselves… minerals mostly,” according to John P. Boucher, supervisor for fire safety services for FMO Fire Group – may color the water, making faucets run yellowy-orange water.
But quadlings, don’t be too quick to mock the river. Fell free to rejoice tomorrow, but the silty sinks will soon head out there, too. All of Harvard’s hydrants will be checked sometime this fall, Boucher said.
The rust colored water, though unappetizing, is safe for consumption. (Boucher said he would drink it.)
Full text of the announcement after the jump.
Here’s the text of the announcement:
THE FMO FIRE GROUP WILL BE CONDUCTING ANNUAL FIRE HYDRANT MAINTENANCE AND FLOW TESTS BETWEEN  4:00PM AND 8:00PM IN THE River Area
Maintenance and testing will be conducted between the hours 4:00PM and 8:00PM Hydrant testing is performed to ensure operability and to identify and repair those hydrants requiring maintenance. In addition to hydrant testing, we will be performing water main flushing.
Hydrant testing may disturb the sediment that naturally occurs in the water piping system. Water from your faucets and toilet may appear rust colored from this disturbance. Rust discoloration may last for several hours after the tests have been completed. Discolored water does not usually present a health hazard, however; it is recommended that anyone who has doubts about the rust colored water should not drink it. If you do not have bottled water, you may wish to store tap water in your refrigerator for the day of the test.
We also suggest that dorm residents check their water before doing laundry because the discolored water may stain clothes. If you would like to know when the hydrants are being tested in your area, please review the schedule shown below or call the FMO Fire Safety Services at 617- 496-4075  for daily test locations. If you have any questions on water quality  Jim Cullity at 617-894-6841.
