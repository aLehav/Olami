After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One thing the casual iPhone user may not have noticed about the shiny new iOS 5: the ability to let your friends know when you’ve read their iMessages. Usually, iMessage will tell you that a message has been delivered, and nothing more. If your friend has enabled Read Receipts under Settings, though, you’ll instead be able to see at what time your message was read. This is a handy tool for the paranoid amongst us who need to know if somebody is ignoring them. But Read Receipts also reflect society’s movement away from traditional methods of long-distance communication and toward a more realistic model of in-person communication.
The traditional handwritten, mailed letter differs from talking in several key aspects. You can expect several days in between every exchange, you cannot actually see the other person, you don’t know if somebody has read your letter, and you don’t know when your correspondent is replying to your message. Technology like Skype and FaceTime eliminate all of these factors. Advanced text messaging software like iMessage or Blackberry Messenger do pretty well, allowing you to see when the person you are texting is typing or has read your message, but text messaging does not.
Is a realistic technological substitute for in-person communication desirable, though? At first glance, it would seem so. The video for the new iPad, another Apple creation, opens with “technology is at its very best when it’s invisible”. This is true. Technology should make our lives easier, without getting in our way. Communication technology should be unnoticeable, and, therefore, it should try to resemble in-person communication.
But what if we don’t always want technology to be invisible? In her book “Alone Together,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Sherry R. Turkle explores how social media is changing the way we communicate. The interviews featured in her book describe a population that is hesitant to pick up the phone, one that cherishes being able to think through its responses to every text message, deleting and rewriting the same text time and time again.
Does that make me distrust online communication? Yes. I feel important conversations should be had in person because then I can pick up on body language cues like hesitation. I turn my Read Receipts on in part to keep me honest through texts. That doesn’t mean, though, that I don’t like choice or online communication.
Although choice is not always a good thing, especially when we have too many options, it can be seen in a positive light when one of the options is as liberating as the ability to think your answer through thoroughly. The people Turkle documents who feel uncomfortable with in-person communication find an escape in traditional text messaging or on Facebook. Though I am adamantly opposed to having a serious conversation online, I understand its appeal.
Apple seems to understand this. Like Facebook chat, iMessage will show when someone is typing, but he or she can still turn Read Receipts on or off, or turn iMessage off completely and return to normal texting. This choice is what ultimately separates iMessage from rival BlackBerry Messenger. When I graduated from high school in Panama last year, my classmates did not text; everyone used BBM, which does not give you the option of turning off Read Receipts. Though iPhones have gained in popularity, BBM is still a significant method for communication in Panama. On a philosophical level, it’s a shame that many Panamanians simply don’t have a choice about Read Receipts.
I never cared about Read Receipts when I was on BBM. My friends didn’t seem to mind either. We loved being able to see when others read our messages.  But ultimately, BBM went further than iMessage did by forcing Read Receipts onto you. Not even Skype, arguably the most realistic model of interpersonal communication, does this—you ultimately have the choice of muting yourself, or turning your camera off at any time.
Read Receipts models in-person communication better than traditional text messaging does, but we don’t always want technology to be invisible. Ultimately, maintaining personal choice in how we communicate is more important than creating invisible technology, an observation that Apple should be commended for making.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Indulge your passion for science…but let your science be human, and such as may have a direct reference to action and society. Be a philosopher; but amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.” These are the words of David Hume, an important figure in early modern thought. I came upon them at a very critical time—just after I had finally decided to become a philosophy concentrator, surprising myself, my friends, and my advisers in the department of molecular and cellular biology.
Upon an initial reading of these words in Hume’s “Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding,” I recall feeling justified in my decision to become a newly minted “philosopher.” Hume, after all, explicitly tells us all to be philosophers. What great news for me! I mean, I had clearly made the right decision and was well on my way to that proverbial armchair to philosophize until my head hurt. And how very much in the spirit of a liberal arts education to make such a move, in abandoning what most would consider a highly practical course of study for one of questionable applicability to the so-called “real world”—and all because of a pure interest in the subject.
But after a more careful interpretation of Hume’s words and reflection on what I had done, I realized that I had not really become any more of a philosopher by changing my concentration than I had previously been as a student of biology—or, just a student, more generally, regardless of the concentration listed on my transcript. Hume had in mind thinkers of all disciplines—bachelors, masters and doctors of all arts and all sciences. He was not lauding his own field of study in calling all men to lives of philosophy, but rather encouraging us all to be true thinkers, not recreational intellectuals but lifelong scholars in whichever subjects strike our fancy.
Yet the most important part of Hume’s message is that, amidst our questioning, contemplating, and investigating, we are called, still, to humanness. My personal realization with regard to this was that, just because the content of my studies as a new philosophy student was now perhaps more esoteric, I had not somehow escaped an expectation of practicality. Even as I was about to embark on studies which certainly were not going to cure cancer or fix the economy, I nonetheless had and still have a duty to contribute meaningfully to society, to humanize my knowledge or, at the very least, to dare to leave the clouds of the intellect in order to help a world in desperate need of altruism. As members of the human race, we have a practical responsibility to our neighbors and to society as a whole. We must not allow ourselves to become passive in this global community. We must continue to help each other, and we must keep the development of human understanding as an important common goal.
It’s easy for thinkers like us to get so lost in the realm of inquiry that we tend to lose sight of our humanity. Ironically, those of us in the humanities are often guilty of this, with our intense theorizing and, admittedly, at times obscure jargon. Yet science has also been guilty, when the grind of running experiments shrouds a human disease at hand, or when protocol threatens to obfuscate the very human hopes motivating our research.
So, in the spirit of Hume, let me present to you this Humean challenge: Now that you have indulged your passion for academics, ask yourself who you are behind that Harvard diploma, and become reacquainted with your own personal humanity. Continue to learn, question, investigate, and provide answers. You should indulge in intellectual pursuits. But don’t forget about your humanity, and be an active participant in this human society. Do not let your studies interfere with the relationships you cherish; hold on to the people you love, and always put them first. Do not be afraid to sometimes think less and do more, to leave that comfortable intellectual bubble with which we have all become acquainted and simply do the good deeds the world needs most in these hard times. So yes, be a philosopher, but be, first, human.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was in high school, my father never ceased to suggest to me that I should learn Mandarin. “The Chinese are going to dominate the world someday,” he would insist. “You should be ready.” Now, I’ve got nothing against foreign languages—I’m a native speaker of one—or Mandarin in particular, but I resisted fiercely. The language simply never appealed to me much.
My dad is hardly the only one to view Mandarin as the language of the future. In many ways, it is the language of the present. With some estimates placing the number of native speakers at 1.1 billion, it is certainly the world’s largest language in absolute terms. Not only that, but the Chinese economy is also expanding with frightening velocity. According to the International Monetary Fund, the real output of China will surpass that of the United States in under five years. With each passing day, the benefits of learning Mandarin increase. Business connections between China and the rest of the world will multiply over the coming years, and it does not seem unlikely that a flourish of Mandarin could help you close that stellar deal. The American educational system seems eager to keep up. From 1997 to 2007, the number of children studying Mandarin at the primary or secondary level grew tenfold, and it has surely increased even more since then. College-level Mandarin programs have seen a similar expansion. The language has been highly successful abroad, as well; in Singapore, for instance, a government program subsidizing classes in Mandarin has proven wildly popular.
Unfortunately, despite the possible benefits the language may offer, the recent boom in Mandarin teaching seems to be shortsighted and excessive. Simply put, Mandarin is not the language of the future. There are multiple reasons for this, but the main one is its complexity. Mandarin is notoriously hard to learn as a second language, and many may only have a rudimentary grasp over it after years of arduous learning. David Moser, a scholar at the University of Michigan, has outlined the reasons for this in an essay titled “Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard.” The writing system for Mandarin is arcane, and it consists of thousands of symbols rather than a simple alphabet. Even native speakers often show little mastery over the script. Mandarin, unlike English, is also a tonal language, which may prove baffling for would-be-learners. The words for “mathematics” and “blood transfusion,” to provide one example, consist of the same sounds pronounced with different stresses. Thus, relative to other languages, Mandarin is simply hard to master for the average English-speaker. The benefits may be there, but the costs—in terms of time and effort spent—are quite high.
English, in contrast, is mercifully easy for the foreign learner. This is one of the main reasons (along with a British knack for conquering) that it is the current global lingua franca. Unlike many other languages, English lacks gendered nouns, a trivial linguistic aspect that can be hard to master. There is no need for a person learning English to remember whether “sun” is male and “moon” female, or vice-versa, as in, for example, Spanish. Nouns aside, English also boasts a remarkably simple and flexible grammar system, a heritage of its Anglo-Saxon roots. In addition, English is a mutt of a language, a strange concoction of Germanic Old English, Viking Norse dialects, Norman French, and a bit of Greek thrown in for good measure. This not only means that English has an impressively rich vocabulary, but also that it is related to a large number of the world’s most common languages. It is comparatively simple for a native German or French speaker to gain some proficiency in English, which will seem familiar, to some degree. Mandarin does not have this advantage. It is related, in addition to numerous other Chinese dialects, to Tibetan and Sherpa.
Taking this into consideration, it seems much of the resources currently dedicated to teaching Mandarin as a foreign language are simply wasted. Seen from a purely objective economic viewpoint, it is more efficient to have a native Mandarin speaker learn English than vice-versa, or for someone who speaks neither language to learn the latter. Less overall effort is required, and correspondingly energy can then be redirected to more productive activities. The end result is the same, as long as both parties are able to communicate. To bolster economic competitiveness, governments would do much better to invest in science, technology, and engineering, as opposed to a language that makes virtually no distinction between the phrases “you flatter me” and “fruit paste.” On an individual level, feel free to learn Mandarin if you want, but don’t fool yourself into thinking you’ll reap the benefits anytime soon. You’re more likely to be in for a long, frustrating ordeal than a pleasant endeavor.
To be sure, all languages are equally valuable in their own way. English is not absolutely better than Mandarin, but it is certainly a better global language. In its own way, Mandarin is a valuable contributor to the world’s linguistic spectrum. But it’s not the language of the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the conclusion of finals, some students promptly returned home, while others left to begin summer internships. Many, however, remained on campus, intending to stay at least another week. Hundreds of undergraduates, working for various student groups or employers such as the Phillips Brooks House Association or the Harvard Alumni Association, were permitted to remain in Harvard housing past the move out date, as they participated in Commencement-related activities.
The presence of Commencement housing prevents students from being forced off campus during this period while providing alumni on-campus space to hold events and reunions unfettered by the excesses of undergraduate life, particularly on weekends. That said, the Office of Student Life can and should make critical improvements to the process that would make Commencement a more enjoyable experience for all students involved.
Bizarrely, the same individuals who manage regular, academic year housing do not supervise the allocation of Commencement housing. The process is instead managed by dorm crew, which handles the logistics of move-in, including rooming assignments and key distribution. While dorm crew is a competent organization, there are reasons that they do not handle housing during the academic year. Why these same reasons do not apply to Commencement housing is unclear. What is apparent, however, is that the disadvantages of having a less-equipped organization handle student housing were felt last week; reports of females sharing sink rooms with males, disproportionate space allocations, and whole groups of students omitted from the housing lists reveal errors made during Commencement that College administrators would never permit during the academic year.
The lack of formal infrastructure for Commencement housing also leads to logistical inconsistencies and a lack of optimization. Housing assignments are decided without any regard to previous rooming situations, so students are just as likely to be asked to move all of their possessions not in storage down the hall as across campus, even when their own rooms are open and available for Commencement housing. A simple policy permitting students to squat in their previous housing (when available) would significantly reduce the hassle associated with the process. A goal to minimize the distance that students have to migrate would be most desirable; even if the OSL only made incremental steps toward achieving this, the Commencement experience would markedly improve for many non-seniors.
Perhaps most crucially, students are only informed of their rooming assignment less than 12 hours before they are required to move out of regular housing. With campus housing spread miles apart, it becomes a challenge to predict where one will be living. It is difficult to arrange transportation without knowing where the luggage will actually end up, and with a required move-out by noon, many students are thrust into the precarious situation of not having a secure location to store their property. This confusing beginning to Commencement compounds the difficulties faced by many students who have to pack and move out of their rooms only a day after finishing their last final.
Ultimately, Commencement is a rewarding experience regardless of one’s rooming situation, but that does not mean there is not much to improve. The OSL should work to make the housing process safer, more convenient, and more equitable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the early 1960s, the progressive idealism just taking root on college campuses was beginning to ripple across the larger American political spectrum.
At Harvard, these shifts manifested in a wholly different political sphere—that of student government.
Political clashes between conservatives and progressives on campus became so divisive that, during the first years of the decade, they triggered the demise and rebirth of the undergraduate student government. The months-long saga of these reform efforts revolved around one campus firebrand: two-term Student Council president Howard J. Phillips ’62, an outspoken conservative whose political leanings drove his more liberal peers to take action.
By the 1961-’62 school year, the creation of the Harvard Council for Undergraduate Affairs, touted as a governing body that would better represent its undergraduate constituents, embodied the shift in campus political sentiment and the role of student government on the Harvard campus.
A CONSERVATIVE ON THE COUNCIL
During his terms on the Student Council, Phillips’ political leanings made him an incendiary figure on campus. Many students felt that Phillips had abused his presidential power and that unabashed and vocal conservatism had politicized Council affairs.
During his undergraduate years, Phillips was involved in numerous right-leaning groups such as the Harvard Young Republicans, Massachusetts Young Republicans, and Youth for Nixon-Lodge in Massachusetts during the 1960 presidential election. His leadership of the Council even garnered national attention from outlets such as TIME Magazine and the National Review, according to a Crimson article published in 1965.
“I was getting a lot of coverage for my role as a national leader of the conservative movement,” Phillips remembered.
His politics made him unpopular on campus, according to Phillips, but it was his comportment at a national convention held in the spring of 1961 that would trigger his own downfall and the Student Council’s.
At the conference, which focused on international youth service, Phillip’s name, accompanied by his Council position, appeared in a controversial letter issued by the Committee for an Effective Peace Corps. The letter suggested that individuals aligned with the Communist Party should not be allowed to join the Peace Corps, according to a 1965 Crimson article.
Led by Michael Hornblow ‘62, a group of Phillips’ rivals seized upon this as their opportunity to oust Phillips. After much back-room discussion, the junto made their move against Phillips at a Council meeting in mid-April. The group petitioned the Council to amend its constitution so that its president and vice president could not hold office or act as a spokesperson for partisan organizations—a new rule that could force Phillips’ abdication from office.
Hornblow said that he believed that  Phillips’ conservative views had permeated Council activities, but Phillips maintained that “the Council was mostly non-ideological.”
“[Phillips’ detractors] thought he was doing too much partisan politics and using the Council as a platform,” Hornblow said.
But Phillips remembered the political climate of the Council differently. “There were a lot of people with different views, people who were active on all sides of the issues,” he said.
For Phillips, the drama and reform efforts of 1961 were ad hominem attacks.
“The Student Council was abolished because the liberals were unhappy with my continuing to be elected,” Phillips said.
THE RISE OF HCUA
Hornblow’s suggestion was defeated in the same session it was proposed, and the drama swirling around the Student Council seemed to have passed. But controversy was reignited a week later when Dunster House Committee Chair William E. Bailey ’62 proposed that his House secede from the Council.
According to a 1961 Crimson article, Bailey’s proposal was based on the claim that the Student Council was ineffective and unproductive—an opinion which many of his classmates shared.
Dunster withdrew from the Council in late April, and Council members scrambled to devise plans of reform in response.
One plan, known as the Phillips-Council plan, suggested that the Council remain intact but expand its representation so that presidents of undergraduate organizations in addition to five members of the sophomore, junior, and senior classes would be included, according to a 1965 Crimson article.
Dunster House members, with the backing of Dean of the College John U. Monro ’35, developed an alternative plan that would abolish the Council and create a new “Student Affairs Committee”—a body whose structure would “prevent another Howie Phillips,” according to a Crimson article.
In November, after months of considerations and planning, the Council approved the Dunster-supported plan. In December, 85 percent of undergraduates voted in favor of the new constitution, and the Harvard Council for Undergraduate Affairs was born.
HCUA differed from the Student Council in several ways. Its membership was 24 instead of 32, and its top positions were called chairman and vice-chairman in attempt to avoid the connotations held by the titles president and vice president.
Whereas the Council under Phillips was known for its partisan bent, William K. Dabaghi ’67, who was elected to HCUA in the following academic year, described the HCUA’s composition as representing “a wide range of students.”
Though personal politics triggered the overhaul of the College’s student government, politics did not taint personal relations.
“He was a likeable guy,” Hornblow said. “I don’t think he really had enemies. We disagreed with him but it was a friendly disagreement.”
And Phillips acknowledged that he was a man of controversy on campus.
“I had my opinions,” Phillips said. “It is important to have one’s views tested and placed under scrutiny.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Passed by Congress in August 1958, in the aftermath of what President Dwight D. Eisenhower termed the “Sputnik crisis,” the National Defense Education Act was designed to boost America’s scientific prowess and support education at all levels. However, federal funds came with a catch—beneficiaries would have to sign an affidavit disclaiming belief in the over throw of the U.S. government and take a loyalty oath.
In November 1959, Harvard withdrew from the NDEA student loan program, joining universities from across the country in protest against the affidavit and the limitations on free speech that it entailed.
Two years later, in the fall of 1961, President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 reopened the debate among the faculty, which voted unanimously to reaffirm its boycott.
“Although it will hurt the University to continue to refuse the funds,” government professor Robert G. McCloskey told The Crimson that October, “it is a price we can and must pay.”
THE CONTROVERSY BEGINS
The NDEA emerged within the context of a post-Sputnik frenzy to surpass the Soviet Union in the Space Race, resulting in efforts to beef up math, science, and foreign language departments across the country. In addition to supplying funds to these departments, the act provided generous student loan funding: participating universities would be matched nine dollars in federal grants for one dollar from their own resources.
Yet Title X, Section 1001 (f) of the NDEA cited two stipulations for loan recipients. An individual could not receive funds “unless such individual...has executed and filed with the Commissioner an affidavit that he does not believe in, and is not a member of and does not support any organization that believes in or teaches, the overthrow of the United States Government by force or violence or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods.” The individual also had to “solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the United States of America.”
Before coming to Harvard, Pusey established himself as an outspoken opponent of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy while he was president of Lawrence College. Still, in 1958, the year the Act was passed, Pusey accepted the funding, lauding “the high motives which prompted Congress to pass the...Act” while simultaneously describing the loyalty oath as “rude and unworthy of Congress” and “a direct personal affront.”
But by September 1959, the faculty became more vocal about the apparent inconsistency between criticizing the loyalty oath requirement and benefiting from the funds. After the failure of the bill to remove the loyalty oath proposed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy ’40, the faculty became more critical of Pusey’s accommodating stance.
A month later, the faculty and the Corporation voted to boycott federal funding. Both cited the affidavit requirement, rather than the loyalty oath, as the primary motivator.
The boycott movement also included Princeton and Yale, as well as dozens of other universities. But as the years passed, the University began to reconsider the issue. “We felt in the first two years we could get along without the money,” Pusey said. “We’re a little worried now”
By October 1961, he reopened the debate before the faculty. The previous summer, Pusey had appeared before congressional committees to promote the repeal of the affidavit provision, but Kennedy’s bill to do so failed once again.
In its October meeting, the faculty confirmed its stance from two years earlier.
In a staff editorial before the decision, The Crimson declared the affidavit “a symbol of hate from a hysterical past, a badge of suspicion of ideas and of men who use them. As long as it is enforced it will indicate an ugly fact—that academic freedom has become a cliché in America before it has become a reality.”
BRINGING STUDENTS TO THE STREETS?
However, students from the time remember the affidavit generating more criticism from faculty than from undergraduates.
“There was an awareness that the U.S. rightly or wrongly thought it needed to catch up [to the Soviets],” said Mary Ellen Gale ’62, a former Crimson editor. Many undergraduates agreed with Pusey’s statement that the loyalty oath was “odious.”
Yet the NDEA debate failed to gain considerable traction among the student body.
“The thing that brought Harvard students to the streets was when they learned that the diplomas were going to be de-Latinized,” said former Crimson president Frederic L. Ballard Jr. ’63.
This apathy was partly a question of timing. Sandwiched between the height of McCarthyism in the early 1950s and increased student radicalism of the late 1960s, the years 1959-1962 were relatively tame ones. The question of student loans, at that time, was not particularly polarizing to many students.
“Student loans were not as a big a thing in our lives as I think it is today,” Ballard said. “We were, I think, very unaware of family money.”
Harvard boasted its own scholarship programs, and, in comparison to other universities, was perceived as better able to reject federal funds.
“The University is one of the few institutions in the nation still wealthy enough to defy Congress on this kind of issue,” declared a staff editorial in 1961.
A REVERSAL
A year later, the affidavit requirement was repealed under the Kennedy administration. Harvard and its peer institutions agreed to accept federally funded student loans.
In the fall of 1962, Harvard received $240,000; in 1963, that amount increased to approximately $350,000. By 1964, the University requested $1 million from the federal government.
Harvard’s own student loan program had increased dramatically over the same time period. Yet tuition was also rising, so the NDEA money allowed the University to continue to expand its scholarship programs as well.
The debate regarding the loyalty oath had shifted toward a debate about educational equity and socioeconomic diversity within American universities.
“Educators...may one day get down on their hands and knees to thank the powers that be for Sputnik,” wrote Efrem Sigel ’64, former associate managing editor of the Crimson in October 1963. “There is hope, therefore, that Congress will move from the modest NDEA program to a large commitment to increasing educational opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Marshall H. Bailey became Harvard’s first medical adviser in 1897, the University had no infirmary. He remained its only physician for a quarter century, eventually successfully advocating for an infirmary, where he performed “hundreds of successful operations under primitive conditions,” according to a Crimson article published in 1953.
But by 1953, that level of care would no longer suffice. Arlie V. Bock, the Henry K. Oliver Professor of Hygiene, began to advocate for a new infirmary and health center between Dunster and Holyoke streets to serve the University community. His urging was the start of a multi-year endeavor to construct the building that opened in the fall of 1961 as the Holyoke Center.
HARVARD HEALTH, A HISTORY
Bailey’s crusade to create a campus infirmary succeeded in 1902, and by 1914, Harvard had launched a university-wide hygiene department, the predecessor to the present-day University Health Services. But subsequent discussions to expand medical care offerings began nearly four decades later.
In 1953, students and administrators met in committees to plan for a new centralized location for the University’s medical unit, which would allow for state-of-the-art medical treatment.
The hygiene department announced its plan to construct this new building, then called the Health Center, in the fall of 1954. Despite providing antibiotics and dental care at the existing hygiene building, located at 15 Holyoke Street, the hygiene department had no facility for eye treatment. Instead, medical specialists at the 15 Holyoke Street center referred students to see a specialist.
A new, more expansive health center would enable more health services to be performed in-house.
CONSTRUCTION IN SITE
Architectural sketches for the new health center were completed in 1956. In a Crimson article from that year, Dana L. Farnsworth, director of the Harvard University Health Services, estimated that the project costs would exceed $2 million.
In a report to the Board of Overseers, Harvard University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 expressed his support of the Health Center.
“Some would say that a new centrally located health center for Harvard and Radcliffe...is the most crying need of all,” he wrote.
The architectural plans combined the Stillman Infirmary and the hygiene building to create a unified center that would be able to provide care to students 24 hours a day.
By 1959, administrators confirmed that construction for the new building could start as early as that year. More detailed architectural sketches suggested that the administration was nearly certain that it would build the facility, according to a 1959 Crimson article.
University Health Services had “been waiting 24 years to obtain adequate facilities for the University,” Farnsworth noted.
Construction was split into four phases. The first phase was intended to house medical facilities, and the second phase would expand office space for UHS. The third and fourth phases would create more administrative spaces and a bank. The cost for the first-phase medical facilities alone was $3.5 million. The projected total cost of the project quickly rose from $2 million in 1956 to more than $10 million in 1959.
NO VACANCY
Even in the early stages, the structure was expected to extend far down Dunster Street. Many popular establishments would be shut down, including Cronin’s Bar, a central hangout spot for Harvard students.
The bar would only shutter its doors in 1965, in the last leg of the construction of the Holyoke Center. Several surrounding establishments were also concurrently destroyed to make room for the new building.
While construction was ongoing, shopkeepers debated whether to rent out alternate space. Ultimately, such a move would cause “an economic problem,” said James D. Cronin, the owner of the popular bar, in a 1957 Crimson article.
Joseph M. Russin ’64 said students thought the growing structure was “ugly” and “totally out of character with the Yard across the street and the other buildings on Mass. Ave,” in an email to the Crimson.
Many of the former establishments surrounding it shut down permanently. When the Holyoke Center opened, new business popped up around the building. Over the years, it transformed from a gleaming new building to a familiar facade.
“It has become ‘part of the scenery’ rather than something that was once blueprints or naked girders,” wrote Claude E. Welch Jr. ’61 in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a December afternoon in 1960, 40 students stood in the courtyard of Quincy House armed with a banner that read, “I’d rather crawl to Moscow on my knees than die in nuclear war.” They were gathered at the inaugural event for Tocsin—a student organization that would become active in the radical call for nuclear disarmament in the early 1960s.
“We called it a walk, not a march,” recalled Todd A. Gitlin ’63, who served as one of Tocsin’s chairs.
Gitlin said the students involved hoped to reach their peers through intellectual appeals rather than through a large protest, and planned to disperse across campus engaging their classmates in conversation about current affairs in Washington.
Fifteen years into the Cold War, in the midst of heightened nuclear testing, these early student activists were taking a controversial stance on nuclear weapons policy, which they hoped would awaken students and faculty in the Harvard community.
Though Tocsin dissolved only four years after its founding, the organization’s efforts marked the beginning of student activism at Harvard, eventually giving rise to a strong chapter of Students for a Democratic Society and paving the way for other activist organizations.
The group’s name, Tocsin, signifies a warning or alarm bell. Founded a decade before activism on campus peaked with the 1969 takeover of University Hall, Tocsin signaled of the start of Harvard’s student movement.
A SLUMBER OF IGNORANCE
Barbara R. Du Bois ’62, one of Tocsin’s founders, recalled that an apolitical climate motivated her and three of her classmates to create the organization.
“What I was struck by was the general movement of apathy of the country towards the issue of disarmament,” she said. “There was serious threat of nuclear annihilation with the proliferation of nuclear war.”
Carrying handmade signs and a vision to awaken the Harvard community, Du Bois and other members of Tocsin marched down Mass Ave. during their first official protest. What she remembered from that day is not a shift in campus sentiments but rather the admonishing words of a woman who confronted her in the street, arguing against a movement that criticized the government.
“This is a democracy,” Du Bois remembered her opponent shouting. “People shouldn’t be allowed to do this.”
AWAKENING
During its active years, Tocsin carried out its mission to promote awareness about nuclear disarmament through protests, marches, and intellectual conversation in and around Harvard’s campus.
“Countering the political and moral apathy required that people not only see their relationship but also the possibility that they could have an effect,” Du Bois said. “That principle animated our efforts in the early years.”
According to Tocsin leaders, events they held were well attended by students and faculty with a range of opinions on the issue.
John H. Ehrenreich ’63, who served as Tocsin’s secretary, recalled an early Tocsin event during which organization leaders asked students to show their support for nuclear disarmament by donning blue armbands.
“On the one hand we got things like ‘go back to Russia,’ and on the other hand we got about 1,000 students wearing blue armbands,” he said.
Former Vice-Chairman of Tocsin Christopher A. Sims ’63, who won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Economics, said that government professors Stanley H. Hoffmann and Henry A. Kissinger ’50 regularly met Tocsin members for lunch to talk about politics.
“They thought we were a little naive or radical. In particular, Kissinger enjoyed provoking us,” Sims said, highlighting the intellectual discourse that Tocsin emphasized.
PUSHING THE AGENDA
February 1962 saw Tocsin’s largest protest effort. According to The Crimson, Tocsin helped plan and joined “Project Washington,” which brought hundreds of Harvard and Radcliffe students and many more from universities across the country to the capital to protest and meet with political leaders, including National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy.
Promoting an agenda for nuclear disarmament, Tocsin’s leaders drafted an eight-page policy paper to present to congressmen.
The protesters received little support from officials in Washington—one representative called them, “full of baloney” while another criticized the students’ “emotional outbursts,” The Crimson reported. But Sims said Tocsin’s efforts were successful in bringing attention to the need for policy change.
“We thought there was a significant risk of nuclear war and people weren’t doing enough about it,” he said. “It seemed like an important issue where pushing an out-of-the-box agenda seemed to make a difference.”
‘AHEAD OF THE CURVE’
At the time of Tocsin’s founding, few student-run activist organizations existed. Through its affiliation with the Student Peace Union, a national coalition of organizations like Tocsin, its members helped pioneer an era of activism on college campuses.
“I think we were very ahead of the curve,” said Du Bois. “This was an elite university in the country and we were right there in the front.”
According to the Tocsin leaders, their role as a pioneer of student protest necessitated less extreme demands and methods.
But Gitlin said that the path that Tocsin blazed empowered later student movements. After serving as Tocsin’s chairman, Gitlin became president of the growing national organization Students for a Democratic Society.
“Tocsin was a very modest and well behaved organization,” he said. “It was much more careful and cautious than the Occupy movement,” about which he recently published a book.
Sims said similarities still exist between student movements in 1962 and those that are happening today, 50 years later.
“It’s students thinking about issues that matter for their future and getting angry,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before she arrived in Tanganyika in the summer of 1963, Gail M. Gerhart ’65 had never seen a mango tree or even eaten a mango. Every afternoon, in the elementary school where she taught English, a bell would ring, signaling the end of the day. Upon hearing this alert, Gerhart recalled that the children leapt out of their seats and bolted toward the door.
“I thought, ‘Maybe I’m a bad teacher,” she said.
But it was not Gerhart’s teaching that propelled the young students out of the schoolhouse. Outside the front door stood a “gigantic” mango tree from which fresh fruit fell each day.
“If you were the first one out there, you could eat the mangos that fell under the tree,” she said. “I was relieved.”
That summer, Gerhart was one of 20 undergraduates participating in the third summer of the Philips Brooks House Association’s Project Tanganyika, which gave undergraduate participants the opportunity to travel to Africa at the peak of the decolonization movements throughout the continent.
Project Tanganyika sent its first cohort of volunteers abroad in the summer of 1961. That December, Tanganyika gained independence from the United Kingdom.
The first PBHA program that took students abroad, Project Tanganyika represented the widespread idealism that emerged at Harvard during the early 1960s.
Despite the reality that an independent African Studies program would not exist at Harvard until 1969, Project Tanganyika significantly influenced its participants, encouraging many to find careers in civil rights and public service in the United States and in Africa.
‘AN OUTLET FOR YOUNG ENERGY’
Project Tanganyika embodied the idealism and sense of adventure that permeated the Harvard campus in the early 1960s.
Even before President John F. Kennedy ’40 passed the Peace Corps Act, which officially established the international public service organization in 1961, Peter C. Goldmark Jr. ’62 was conjuring his own plan to travel to Africa.
Goldmark’s intellectual interest in Africa, along with inspiration from a group of students who had traveled to Africa through the non-profit organization Operation Crossroads Africa, motivated him to develop Project Tanganyika.
According to Goldmark he envisioned the program as “an outlet for young energy in the world.”
Robert J. Bennett ’64, who traveled with Project Tanganyika, said that Kennedy’s idealism inspired students to apply for the program.
“That [Kennedy] was organizing this Peace Corps was something so radical and so idealistic that it was something that did have an impact on us,” he said.
Bennett added that the desire for adventure also compelled students to join Project Tanganyika.
“I was a freshman [in 1961] and [Harvard] was pretty exciting intellectually,” he said. “But it was only intellectual.”
In addition, some students went to Africa driven by their political sentiments.
As Africa emerged as a battleground in the Cold War, some saw Harvard’s presence on the continent as opposing the communist powers they feared might emerge.
“We thought of ourselves as an outpost in the Cold War,” Bennett said.
In January 1961, Project Tanganyika became an official PBHA program, and students began to apply for the inaugural trip that summer. Their only barrier—as a completely student organized venture—was funding.
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY
At the end of a luncheon hosted by Eleanor Roosevelt in 1961, the former first lady stood up and made an announcement to her guests. According to Gerhart, Roosevelt—whose grandson Haven C. Roosevelt ’62 was planning to travel to Tanganyika that summer—said, “Okay everybody, take out your checkbooks and write a check for these people who want to go to Africa.”
Despite Roosevelt’s generosity, funding continued to be a problem throughout the program’s existence.
The cost of sending students to Tanganyika ranged from $30,000 to $45,000 per year, all of which the student participants raised themselves.
While the administration did not oppose the program, Bennett said the fact that students had to raise all the funds created a potential barrier.
“I realized that it was never really certain that we would go,” he said.
But, each year, the participants proved successful in raising the money they needed to travel to Africa.
SERVICE ABROAD
During their time in Tanganyika, the students worked in a variety of capacities. Several taught English at Tanganyikan schools while others worked for aid initiatives across the country.
In 1962, Project Tanganyika began offering a year-long option in addition to its original summer program.
Bennett, who chose to stay for a year, traveled to villages throughout Tanganyika with a British famine relief organization. Along with British civil servants, he handed out food coupons the villagers could redeem at shops stocked with American products.
“There were hundreds and hundreds of people waiting for these little green coupons,” he remembered.
Karen L. Worth ’64, who spent a summer in Tanganyika, described the lifestyle as “very simple.” Worth lived in a mud and thatch house in a camp  for Tutsi refugees who had been displaced from Burundi.
She taught English to elementary school students during the day and at night held classes for adults.
“We were simply there as teachers and as members of the community,” she said.
'A TIME OF ENORMOUS HOPE'
The peak of the liberation movements in the early 1960s invigorated Tanganyika with a sense of optimism. As a result, Bennett said that the people they met embraced the young Americans.
“It was a time of enormous hope and very little anti-American feelings,” Goldmark said.
According to Gerhart, cities in Tanganyika became home to the headquarters for African liberation movements. She remembered that FRELIMO, an organization that advocated for independence for Mozambique, at the time a Portuguese colony, had its base in Dar es Salaam.
On Dec. 9, 1961, Tanganyika gained independence. Three years later, the country merged with the new island nation of Zanzibar to become Tanzania.
At a ceremony on the night of its independence from Britain, Bennett remembers that the Tanganyikans lowered the Union Jack and sang the anthem, “God Save the Queen” for the last time, raising the Tanganyikan flag in its place as they sang the anthem of Tanganyika.
That evening the newly independent Tanganyikans danced in celebration. As he and a friend watched the festivities, Bennett said a woman took their hands and pulled them into the circle, including them in the revelry.
“They saw us as liberators,” Bennett said. “They really accepted us, at least on the surface.”
INDEPENDENT EDUCATION
While University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28 would later celebrate Project Tanganyika for its worldly vision that extended beyond students’ own “private affairs and thoughts,” administrators were initially apprehensive about the new program.
“They really thought it was never going to happen,” Goldmark said, adding that because Project Tanganyika preceded the Peace Corps, administrators were uncomfortable with the unfamiliar idea of international service.
But the program’s participants said they remained indifferent to the administration’s opinions.
“I didn’t care whether faculty supported us because [Project Tanganyika] was PBH,” Worth said.
Before leaving for Tanganyika, Peter de Lissovoy—who would have graduated in 1964, but left Harvard to work for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, an American Civil Rights organization—remembered that a professor said to him, “Okay, see you later. Don’t get lost over there, now.”
“I would say that everybody took it in stride and nobody paid any special attention,” de Lissovoy said.
As their interest in Africa grew, some students found themselves wanting more courses in African Studies than Harvard offered.
Goldmark said that the only course that addressed Africa was one graduate seminar.
“It was not the world’s most profound or exciting course,” he added.
Gerhart said her experience as part of Project Tanganyika compelled her to study Africa in an academic context.
“It was a little frustrating because there were only a handful of courses,” Gerhart said.
Following her undergraduate studies, Gerhart—who would later work in sub-Saharan Africa—pursued a Ph.D. in Public Law and Government at Columbia, which she said had a “much stronger African Studies program.”
Though Goldmark and others involved with Project Tanganyika pushed the Committee on Educational Policy to offer credit for the course in Swahili that the program required, their request was denied.
Pusey supported the CEP’s view that Swahili did not belong among the courses required for the A.B. A February 1962 Crimson article explained Pusey’s position that Harvard should teach “only languages which have a substantial literature or the study of which leads to a doctorate.”
Harvard did not have an independent African Studies department until 1969, when black students marched to demand a student role in establishing an African Studies program and hiring black faculty.
A LIFELONG INFLUENCE
Project Tanganyika had a lasting impact on many of its participants, significantly influencing their work later in life.
David Zarembka ’66 entered the Peace Corps after graduating. He moved to Kenya following his tenure there and eventually founded the African Great Lakes Initiative, which promotes peace “at the grassroots level in the Great Lakes region of Africa,” according to its website. In 2011, Zarembka published a book about politics in the region.
Late human rights activist and historian Alison Des Forges ’64, who traveled to Tanganyika with Worth in 1963, became a prominent figure in issues related to Africa. Des Forges served as a senior adviser in the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. For her work as an activist and her book “Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda,” Des Forges was awarded the MacArthur “Genius Grant” in 1999.
“For Alison, it became her life’s work,” Worth said. “It was a wonderful opportunity that had an impact in the work we did later.”
When his time with Project Tanganyika concluded, de Lissovoy chose to stay in Africa, hitchhiking to Rhodesia, South Africa, and Cairo. While working for a Rhodesian newspaper, he was arrested in South Africa for interviewing President of the African National Congress Albert Luthuli and returned to Harvard following his deportation.
Within a year, de Lissovoy left Harvard to join SNCC and went to Georgia to participate in the American Civil Rights Movement.
“The freedom movements in Africa made me aware of what was going on in the United States, so that led me to join up with SNCC,” he said.
De Lissovoy credited Project Tanganyika for preparing him for his work in American Civil Rights and for providing its participants with a transformative experience.
“I think the kids learned far more than they gave,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the night of November 8, 1960, Crimson photographer Judith H. Blitman ’61 watched the returns roll in at the Kennedy Compound, the culmination of months of work covering the campaign for the newspaper.
“I met a lot of famous reporters. The whole national press was there. It was very, very exciting,” Blitman remembered.
But the next afternoon, when Blitman returned to campus after watching the victory speech of John F. Kennedy ’40 at the Hyannis Armory, she faced a consequence that her male colleagues on the paper did not have to deal with—Radcliffe’s rules.
“They made me stay in for the next weekend,” she recalled.
As a Radcliffe student in the early 1960s, Blitman’s social life and behavior, including how late she could stay out each night, was dictated by an extensive catalog of rules, bound in a 100-page volume known as The Red Book.
The Red Book contained guidelines for nearly every situation that might arise for Radcliffe women. According to one by-law, “when a student visits a man’s apartment or room not in a college dormitory, another girl or couple should be present,” while another regulation set out that “an older couple should be present at any private party which lasts later than 1 a.m.”
By staying out all night, Blitman had violated one of the core precepts of The Red Book: the code of parietal rules that was laid out over five pages of the handbook.
Though Blitman was punished under the rules of the 1960-’61 edition of The Red Book, by the following fall many of the traditional regulations that the book mandated were increasingly being called into question by the students that they affected.
During the 1961-’62 school year, debates over the purpose of these curfews and other rules for the proper conduct of a Radcliffe student were symptomatic of the emerging revolution in the role of women on Harvard’s campus and beyond.
LIFE UNDER CURFEW
As a senior, Blitman no longer lived with a specific curfew mandated by The Red Book. Her infraction during the Kennedy election, instead, had been failing to “secure permission for an overnight absence.”
According to the regulations set down in The Red Book, sophomores and juniors had to sign in to their residence halls by 1 a.m. unless they had special permission from the head resident or hall president in their dormitory for an event like a cast party or a formal. Freshmen could stay out until 10 p.m., although they were allowed to be in the library until 11:15.
“We just sort of accepted it,” Blitman said of the curfew that dictated her life at the University. “And fighting it was out of the question. Somehow in 1960 it just didn’t occur to me to get active, nor did it occur to any of my female colleagues.”
The rules had been intended to protect the students of Radcliffe by both preserving their reputations and keeping them safe from sexual advances.
But rather than make life easier, women who attended Radcliffe in the early 1960s have said that the rules perpetuated a culture in which they felt like second-class citizens on Harvard’s campus.
At the time, Harvard’s attitude toward women, according to Patricia A. Marks Greenfield ’62, was based on the idea that “‘The problem is women.’ Not, ‘The problem is men.’”
For the women of Radcliffe, the curfew was inextricably linked with the deeper feelings that male members of the Harvard community had about their presence there.
“We were ‘tolerated’ but we were also put down to some degree. There were things we weren’t permitted to do,” Caroline R. Herron ’62 said.
Moreover, by the beginning of the 1960s a feeling arose that the increasingly available ways to get around the curfew had rendered the rules useless.
Herron recalled missing the curfew twice during her time at Radcliffe. Once, she remembered, she was in a car that broke down, and another time she and a group of friends had trouble getting back from Revere Beach.
“Once I managed not to be detected and once I went and confessed,” she said of the incidents. And when she did turn herself in, the consequences were not very severe.
“I don’t remember being chained to my bed or anything,” she said. “I believe I may have gotten a talking-to.”
REVOLUTION OF ’62
In November of 1961, the Radcliffe Student Government Association announced a plan to restructure student government at the college.
As the school year progressed, the debates over legislative representation for Radcliffe students had opened up into a discussion of the value of The Red Book and the larger relationship of Radcliffe students to the University.
Increasingly, students demanded that the proposed student government have more control over the rules at Radcliffe, especially concerning their curfew.
Then, in December, the Freshman Class Committee demanded later curfews and less restrictive policies on exceptions to the curfew rules. The SGA backed the proposal, and upperclassmen commented to The Crimson at the time that the rules for freshman should be relaxed past even what the freshmen had proposed.
In February, Radcliffe student leaders and administrators discussed academic and social issues facing the college at the Cedar Hill Conference, a biennial meeting between the SGA and Radcliffe deans. In 1962, the big occasion at the forum was the presentation of a new constitution, penned by Ruth Wyler Messinger ’62, which would establish a new central governing body for the college’s students: the Radcliffe Government Association.
The official proposal would already mark a major shift in control of the school’s parietal rules. Under the new system, the RGA would set social regulations of the college, a duty that traditionally fell under the jurisdiction of the Dean of Residence and Student Affairs along with the Board of Hall Presidents.
But at the conference, Elizabeth Holtzman ’62 and Deborah Stone ’62 presented their own ideas about new freedoms for Radcliffe’s women: an end to curfew hours for upperclassmen, the abolition of the college’s chaperonage rules, and the elimination of the series of permissions that Radcliffe women had to obtain to sign out for a night.
TAKING SIDES
Holtzman and Stone’s proposal set off a flurry of debate among Harvard and Radcliffe students, one that would come to represent the changing views of Radcliffe and its students’ proper role on campus.
For some, The Red Book, and in particular its parietal rules, served its intended purpose as a means of maintaining the reputation and safety of Radcliffe women.
“At the time I thought it was not a terribly good idea to end the curfew,” Thalassa Hencken
Ali Walsh ’62 remembered. “I’d seen too many people getting in trouble. With no curfew, you had the possibility of date rape and other things like that.”
In addition, the curfew was for some an essential part of keeping up the Radcliffe woman’s veneer of propriety.
In February of 1962, one Radcliffe junior told The Crimson, “Abolishing the curfew might give Radcliffe an awfully bad reputation, not necessarily because of immoral behavior but because of what boys expect to go along with a great deal of freedom.”
Essentially, some argued that Radcliffe students were just not ready.
“The supposition that Radcliffe girls are intelligent, responsible adults is largely false,” Carol E. Hagemann-White ’64 told the Crimson in March of 1962.
But for many students, the changes that Holtzman and Stone proposed would address an already broken system and bring Radcliffe’s policies in line with a cultural demand for greater equality.
According to Holtzman, one of the greatest problems with the curfew was that it was often ignored, with many women coming in after curfew and self-reporting an earlier return to their dorms. The proposal to abolish the curfew was merely about adapting policy to reality.
“The parietal rules were a nuisance,” she recalled. “The question was whether we were going to go with an honor system, whether we were going to change the rules, or whether we were going to, as an alternative, simply fudge.”
For others, the proposed eliminations of the parietals would be an important step in increasing the equality of Radcliffe and Harvard students. Crimson reporter Mary Ellen Gale ’62, for example, found that the curfew, the very issue that she spent much of her time writing about, made it difficult for her to pursue her journalistic aspirations.
“I wanted to have the same opportunities that the men did,” she said. The fight to eliminate the curfew, according to Gale, “was important, from the point of view of someone who wanted to be a part of that man’s world.”
According to Crimson editor Michael Churchill ’61, the men of Harvard were split on the issue: a majority believed that the curfew should be abolished, but others maintained that it was a necessary “protective” measure for the women at Radcliffe.
But the curfew, he recalled, was not at the forefront of the average Harvard student’s mind.
“Most Harvard men didn’t understand how second-class it made the women seem. On the other hand, I don’t think they thought about it a terrible lot either,” Churchill said.
BREAKING CURFEW
In May of 1962, the women of Radcliffe prepared to vote.
First, they voted on the inception of the RGA, which would give students more control over the rules at Radcliffe. When the vote came back in favor of a student government, they took up the issue of the curfew. After months of planning, they brought the measure to a vote. The women voted 500-200 in favor of unlimited sign outs for everyone past the first eight weeks of sophomore year.
But that wasn’t the end of the negotiations. The plan also had to get past the Radcliffe administration.
By early June, the students and the faculty had reached a compromise: the curfew was abolished for juniors, as it had been seniors.
Of her own life under the curfew, Herron said, “We sometimes took it for granted. We sometimes worked around it.”
For Herron and the other members of the class of 1962, the change would have no direct effect on their lives. Before the new rules came into effect, they had already left the Quad behind.
But Herron and her classmates understood—and still understand—the significance of their actions.
“We sometimes—increasingly— moved with one foot in the ’50s and ’60s. We sometimes trialed and we sometimes triumphed and moved things forward,” she said.
That spring, the members of the Class of 1962 trialed and triumphed, and the women of Radcliffe—many of whom had been trained their whole lives to stay within the rules laid out for them—took a step forward with a small part of their lives in their own hands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting in Winthrop dining hall with a few classmates in the fall of 1959, Allan Y. Cohen ’61 pondered what courses to take the next semester. Conversation gradually shifted to a supposedly easy course on motivation.
Someone asked who the professor of the course was.
“I am,” emerged a voice from the end of the table, Cohen remembered. To his surprise, seated a few chairs away was Richard Alpert, now known as Ram Dass, who was the instructor of the course on motivation and an associate professor studying personality and social psychology. Despite this unusual first encounter, Cohen enrolled in Dass’ course, a decision that led to a friendship with the professor.
Dass and his research partner Timothy F. Leary—who would later be described by President Richard M. Nixon as “the most dangerous man in America”—would take Cohen on a trip he would never forget.
By administering hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin to Cohen and Harvard students in the Harvard Psilocybin Project, Dass and Leary generated discord among faculty and students and propelled Harvard to the center of national media attention when details of the ongoing project were exposed in the spring of 1962.
‘GRANDIOSE IDEAS’
While psilocybin, LSD, and other hallucinogenic drugs are illegal today, these substances were legally available in the summer of 1960, when Leary first tried psilocybin during a fateful trip to Mexico with his family. Psilocybin, a naturally-occurring substance found in more than 200 species of mushrooms, transforms an individual’s mental state, triggering reactions that range from euphoria to paranoia. Right away, the young Harvard lecturer was impressed with the potential psychological and scientific implications of the drug.
“He was completely blown away,” said Don Lattin, author of a 2010 book which traces the progression and impact of Leary and Dass’ experimentation. “He came back to Harvard with this idea that psychedelic drugs could provide insights into mental illness.”
His interest was not unusual. According to Lattin, LSD and other hallucinogenic drugs began attracting academic attention in the 1950s, when scientists started to research the potential applications of the drugs in psychotherapy and treatment of mental disorders. But public consumption of the drugs remained low into the early 1960s.
“Most people had never heard of LSD [and other drugs],” Lattin said. “Marijuana was considered a much more dangerous, illegal drug.”
Intrigued by the power of these mind-altering substances, Leary joined forces with Dass and other Harvard researchers to investigate the effects of psilocybin.
“[Leary] had kind of grandiose ideas,” said Professor Herbert C. Kelman, who taught with Leary and Dass in the Department of Social Relations, Harvard’s former multidisciplinary blend of psychology, anthropology, and sociology. “He was an odd character to begin with.”
Cohen, who eventually entered Harvard’s clinical psychology graduate program in 1961, said that he knew both men “very well” and described the researchers as “extremely enthusiastic” about their scientific endeavors.
“[Dass was] a smart, young, quantitative psychologist,” Cohen said, adding that Dass served as his functioning academic adviser for the remainder of his undergraduate career.
With support from Harvard’s Center for Research in Personality, the Harvard Psilocybin Project began in 1960 and entailed a range of studies, including investigations into the ability of the drug to stimulate religious states in seminary school students and to alter the criminal behavior of prisoners.
TRIPPING TOGETHER
Seeking to explore the impact of setting and environmental stimulants on an individual’s response to psilocybin, Leary and Dass launched a campus-centered study of hallucinogens in 1961. Under strict University guidelines, they were only allowed to give the psychedelic drugs to graduate students. They attracted subjects from a required introductory clinical psychology class, which they co-taught, and also found volunteers from the local artistic community, including Allen Ginsberg and Aldous Huxley.
“I was one of the students who was very impressed by the experiment,” said Cohen, who volunteered to participate and called his psychedelic forays “dangerous enough to be even more exciting.”
Starting in the fall semester of 1961, Leary and Dass administered psilocybin to the participants, later following up with them and discussing their experiences. Over time, the researchers tweaked the participants’ environments by adding music and art to observe different reactions and gradually shifted from psilocybin to LSD and mescaline as the drugs of choice.
“It was absolutely exploration, investigation, and understanding,” Cohen said about the qualitative, flexible nature of the experiments.
“Part of the enthusiasm was that this was a new discovery in the theory of consciousness,” he added. “There was a revelatory aspect that had almost a spiritual character to it.”
A group of participants, along with Leary and Dass, even went to Mexico to continue expanding their understanding of psilocybin.
Often, Leary and Dass blurred the boundaries between researchers and their subjects, Lattin said.
“They tripped together,” he said. “This was more controversial than [the use of the drugs].”
Moreover, Leary and Dass began involving undergraduates in their experiments as well, despite the University’s explicit prohibition.
“At first they were fairly cautious,” Lattin said. “They agreed to only graduate students. But [later], Richard Alpert brought in several undergraduates.”
“[This] is what got them into trouble,” he said.
‘PART OF THE RUMOR MILL’
By the spring of 1962, Leary and Dass’ radical study caught the attention of faculty members in the Department of Social Relations.
Kelman, their colleague in the department who had been abroad in Norway, discovered the nature of the experiments through his students.
“While I was away, I was getting letters from my students saying, ‘You won’t believe what is going on here with this drug business,’” he said. “This was totally unorthodox research, and there was a kind of cavalier attitude about the research that felt inappropriate.”
“They were being strongly urged by the two instructors to participate in the drug sessions,” Kelman said a student told him. “He said out of the 12 students in the class, only he and one other student refused to participate.”
“That’s what made me realize how much it had become legitimized,” he added. “I don’t think this was serious research, frankly, and I think it was an abuse of the authority and power of the faculty members over students.”
According to Kelman, some senior faculty members worried that interfering with the experiment would endanger “academic freedom.” Yet other junior faculty members shared Kelman’s concerns, and some worried about the safety of the experiment. This prompted a dramatic face-off in March 1962 between Leary, Dass, Kelman, and Department of Social Relations Chair David C. McClelland, who served as head of the center that sponsored Leary and Dass’ experiment.
“We had misgivings about the educational implications of what was happening,” Kelman said. “It went against the academic values that we tried to promote in our graduate training.”
In response, Leary and Dass continued to defend their experiments, arguing that they could maintain the safety of their experiments by having a physician on call and asserting the value of research into mind-altering drugs.
Meanwhile, amid this faculty resistance, most of the student participants sustained their involvement in the experiment.
“Many of us felt pressure to perform well, given the criticism of our enthusiasm for this research,” Cohen wrote in an email. “Many of us assumed that faculty and others believed that the drugs would interfere with our academic performance. We wished to prove them wrong.”
“Out of all the drug experimenters of the era, we probably studied the most,” he said.
According to Kelman, the initial faculty meeting discussing the fate of the research attracted “all kinds of people,” even those not involved in the experiment.
“This had become part of the rumor mill of the community,” he said.
Following coverage by The Crimson, other newspapers such as The Boston Globe began reporting on the scandal, escalating tensions and bringing the issue to the attention of University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28. Furthermore, official agencies such as the Massachusetts Department of Public Health began investigating the dangers and validity of Leary and Dass’ experiment.
“It wasn’t a secret that this was going on,” Lattin said.
COMING BACK DOWN
Ultimately, both Leary and Dass left Harvard following the scandal generated by their experiments.
“They didn’t really belong anymore in an academic setting,” said Andrew T. Weil ’63, a Crimson reporter who followed the story closely.
Leary left Harvard shortly after the March 1962 faculty meeting, when University administrators decided not to renew his contract because he did not appear for his lectures. Later, he would say that he was fired by Pusey.
“At that point, [Leary] didn’t much care,” Cohen said. “He was pretty involved in the psychedelic movement.”
Leary rose to national prominence in the 1960s counterculture movement due to his experience and support of psychedelic drug use, defending his use of drugs before the Supreme Court, popularizing the phrase “turn on, tune in, drop out,” and even collaborating with The Beatles.
“[Leary] was a cultural icon. His influence was enormous,” Lattin said. “He was certainly a man on a crusade.”
“He saw himself as a prophet,” Lattin added. “He saw himself as a messiah.”
On the other hand, Dass left Harvard in 1963, news of which was displayed on the front page of The New York Times. He continued psychedelic research until 1967, when he left for an inspiring trip to India that led him to a path of eastern philosophy and spirituality and to his eventual name change. According to Weil, this front-page appearance may have marked “one of the first times people in the country heard about LSD.”
He said the experiment contributed to bringing hallucinogenic drugs into the national consciousness.
Yet while their investigation magnified public awareness and use of hallucinogenic drugs, the controversial experiments also stunted future scientific research into psychedelic medicine.
“Leary’s last legacy was that he set back periods of research,” Lattin said. “He launched such a crusade that science suffered.”
Within a few years, research with and use of hallucinogenic drugs such as psilocybin and LSD became illegal.
“It pushed people’s buttons and made it hard for people to research these drugs,” said Weil.
The resistance lasted into the 1990s, but recent years have seen a resurgence of research in these areas.
“It’s taken years for people to be looking at the positive effects of drugs again,” said Weil.
Fifty years removed from the controversy, Cohen said that he believes his chance encounter with Dass was ultimately beneficial.
“Almost all of us would say yes, that was a...set of experiments that changed our lives, and maybe for the better,” Cohen said.
Cohen, who now holds a Ph.D in clinical psychology, specializes in substance abuse prevention research and practice. Co-founder of the Pacific Institute for Research & Evaluation, one of the nation’s largest nonprofit research institutes on drug abuse prevention, Cohen noted that although the experiments did indeed influence his career path, they did so “ironically in the opposite direction.”
“You get high, but you always come down,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Congressman Barney Frank ’61-’62 landed in racially-charged South Carolina for a weekend visit with his college roommate—his first visit to the South—he immediately approached the “colored” water fountain and deliberately bent his head down to take a drink.
“It really showed a lot about his personality,” said Hastings Wyman Jr. ’61, the roommate whom Frank was visiting. “It showed his courage, the same courage that he has brought to his job for all these years. And it showed his impatience for ideas he believed were wrong, a trait that is still clear in his politics.”
One of the most notable fights of Frank’s career—a career which will end when he retires in 2013—has been for gay rights. In 1987 Frank became the first U.S. Congressman to voluntarily announce that he is gay.
In the more than 50 years since that day in the airport, Frank has made a name for himself as not only one of the most effective members of Congress, but also one of the fiercest and most formidable.
A LIBERAL ON CAMPUS
Frank, who was raised in a working-class household in New Jersey, came to Harvard already a fierce political debater with ardent opinions and an expansive knowledge of politics.
“When I first met him, I was struck by his encyclopedic knowledge of American government,” said Charles R. Halpern ’61, who was Frank’s freshman year roommate. “More than just facts, he understood how it worked.”
Halpern and Frank maintained a strong friendship in college and roomed together until Frank took a semester off in the fall of his junior year.
Frank quickly immersed himself in the political scene at the College. In that circle, Frank “was perceived as someone who was very interested and knowledgeable about politics,” according to R. Corbin Houchins ’61, who lived in Frank’s entryway in Matthews in their freshman year.
Frank would often engage in debates with students who held more conservative beliefs, including his roommate, Wyman.
“He and I used to argue all the time,” Wyman said. “But it was not out of anger, it was out of an interest in the topics.”
James W. Segel ’67, who later went on to serve as an adviser to Frank, first met the congressman when Frank was serving as a government tutor in Winthrop House, and Segel decided he was someone worth knowing.
“He would sit with a big cigar and talk about politics,” Segel said. “The good thing was he took people seriously. He didn’t treat them as anything but serious, and he’d argue [with them].... It was what college should be about, actually.”
Frank returned to the South in 1964 to participate in Freedom Summer, a campaign to register black voters in Mississippi, where the black vote had historically been repressed. That summer, at least six people, including two white Jewish volunteers from the North, were killed in Mississippi.
“The first time I met him, he had just returned from Mississippi [Freedom] Summer,” Segel said.  “I respected that he had the physical and moral courage to go down there.”
Though Frank leaned far to the left on many political issues, like those of civil rights, he was highly critical of the socialist movement.
“It led me to understand that some of what I wanted to do, politically, was [to] make sure liberals, politically, did not help people that were sympathetic to the socialist union,” Frank said. “[People] who were not insistent that freedom of speech and democracy had to be preserved.”
Although Frank pictured himself entering academia after college, Halpern said that he knew very early in their relationship that Frank would be best suited to the political arena.
“It was obvious that he was going to major in government and that that would be his career,” Halpern said. “He had the style of a politician and his own style of speaking.”
THE FIREBRAND OF THE HOUSE
Despite his early involvement in political activities both on and off campus, Frank did not believe voters would ever select him for public office.
“Being both gay and Jewish, it never seemed possible that I could be elected to anything,” Frank said. “Both were obstacles to an elected career.”
But despite his own doubts, Frank was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1972 and then to Congress in 1980.
Frank’s friends said that the same traits that had made him a leader in the political sphere at Harvard characterized his time in Congress as well.
Halpern noted that “his wit, his politics of empathy and community, and a mind that works faster than most people’s” served to make him a formidable politician.
“He was kind of a go-to guy on the floor of the House,” said Segel, referring to Frank’s ability to decimate an opponent in debate. “He doesn’t have a peer on the floor.”
Frank is often voted one of the funniest and smartest members of Congress by his peers, traits that, when combined with his short temper, can result in a brutal conversational style.
At one town hall meeting, Frank responded fiercely to a woman who angrily questioned him while holding a picture of President Barack Obama with a Hitler mustache.
“You stand there with a picture of the president, defaced to look like Hitler, and compare the effort to increase health care to the Nazis. My answer to you is, as I said before, it is a tribute to the First Amendment that this kind of vile, contemptible nonsense is so freely propagated,” he said. “Trying to have a conversation with you would be like trying to argue with a dining room table—I have no interest in doing it.”
But his career has more substance than soundbites.
At one point serving as chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Frank has attributed much of his understanding of economics to his education at Harvard.
“What changed me at Harvard was not the political science courses I took but the economics courses,” Frank said. “I learned that liberalism and the free market were entirely compatible.”
THE POLITICIAN AT HOME
Frank’s lifelong advocacy for gay rights has helped shape a world in which he prepares to wed his longtime partner, James “Jim” Ready, in July.
For a long time, Frank’s political success came at the cost of his personal life.
“He really didn’t have a home life,” Ready said. “He just had a work life.”
Yet despite his hectic schedule, family members said that Frank was always a loving and supportive presence. In recent years, they noted that his stress level has gone down and the transformation has been significant.
“He’s a different person now,” Ready said. “He’s happier, he smiles.”
His selection as one of this year’s Class Day speakers, Ready added, brought him joy.
Ready also affectionately noted his partner’s clumsiness.
“Phones or doors or windows—you know how people just touch things and break them? He’s really good at that,” Ready said.
“I’m good at fixing things,” he added.
Madeleine L. Frank ’13, Frank’s niece, said that she loves her uncle’s sense of humor.
“He’s great with everyone,” Madeleine said. “He has a sense of humor that is appropriate for any setting.”
She also said that she admires “the effort that he puts into really spending time with family.”
His loved ones also noted that they are excited about his impending retirement.
“We all know that we’ll get to spend a lot more time with him and he’ll get to spend a lot more time with [Jim],” Madeleine said. “I know he’s very excited.”
For both Ready and Frank, retirement will be a welcome change, one that will only add to the happiness of their summer wedding.
When asked about Frank’s most striking quality, Ready joked, “I don’t think you can print that in the paper.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When he was a graduate student at Harvard, Roald Hoffmann was the only person in his year focusing on the demanding field of chemical physics. Yet when he wasn’t in the lab, Hoffman found unlikely refuges: a poetry shop on Mass. Ave. and the Brattle Theatre, where he immersed himself in foreign films.
A world-class chemist and the 1981 Nobel laureate in chemistry, Hoffmann, who received a Ph.D. in chemical physics from Harvard in 1962, is also the author of five books of poetry and three plays. This life-long love of self-expression through words goes back to his college days, when he enrolled in a poetry class.
“These experiences have meant a tremendous amount to me,” Hoffmann said. “Writing give me a way of expressing myself—different from science—that has more of an emotional currency to it.”
AN IMMIGRANT PATH
Long before he was a poet and a chemist, Hoffmann was a child in a Jewish family in Eastern Europe during World War II.
As a young boy, Hoffmann and his mother hid in the home of a friendly schoolteacher during the Nazi occupation. Fearing for their lives, the two fled to Czechoslovakia, then to Austria, and to Germany, finally arriving in New York City when he was 11, he said.
An immigrant in a foreign country, Hoffmann supplanted his humble beginnings with what he called “the typical path for immigrants to the United States”—after going to schools in Queens and Brooklyn, he attended New York City’s prestigious Stuyvesant High School and continued on to Columbia University.
Completing his graduation requirements in just three years, Hoffmann moved from the Big Apple to Cambridge.
Though he was initially unsure of his desire to become a chemist, Hoffmann developed close relationships with many professors. His research as a graduate student eventually laid the foundation for the Nobel Prize that he shared with Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui, and featured the same eccentricities that made him stand out from the pack.
“He is a genius,” said Lawrence L. Lohr, who shared an office with Hoffmann when they were both graduate students at Harvard. “He learned things extremely quickly and had a great scientific imagination.”
But Hoffmann places the credit for his successes elsewhere entirely.
“Harvard was just wonderful as an intellectual community,” Hoffmann said. “I think what was important was that I wound up with the personal attention of three scientists by living as very much part of the Harvard community.”
FIRST, A CHEMIST
Though he immersed himself in various aspects of the Harvard culture while in graduate school, Hoffmann’s primary identity has always been as a chemist.
“He was very focused on his science,” said Clifford W. Hand, another chemistry graduate student at Harvard at the time. “I think he was a very, very good scientist and he earned everything he got because of that.”
After receiving is Ph.D from Harvard in chemical physics, Hoffmann moved to Cornell University, where he is currently the Frank H. T. Rhodes professor of humane letters, emeritus.
His research in applied theoretical chemistry continues to hold a place within the history books as both major philosophical advances and important scaffolds for future discoveries. The foundations of his work emphasize a scholastic perspective that he said he hopes to relay to young minds today.
“I think my greatest accomplishment is teaching the community of chemists how to use molecular orbitals,” Hoffmann said. “We have adapted it for chemistry and taught them how to learn with orbitals for the shapes of molecules.”
Even with his advanced chemical knowledge, Hoffmann remains a humble man with a passion for spreading understanding. In “The World of Chemistry,” a series of 26 half-hour films that focus on teaching elementary aspects of chemistry to high school and college students, Hoffman made real this vision of sharing chemistry with the wider world.
“I look 25 years younger, but I think it is one of my contributions to chemical teaching,” Hoffmann joked about the videos, which first aired on PBS in 1990. “And I am very glad I made them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Theodore J. Kaczynski ’62 entered Harvard in the fall of 1958 at the age of 16 as a shy, Chicago-raised mathematics prodigy. Twenty years after he took his first class in the Yard, he would mail his first home-made pipe bomb.
Kaczynski, known in the media by his FBI code name “Unabomber,” has been described by the students who remembered him at the College as “shy” and “quiet.”
“He was a loner—he didn’t talk to anyone,” said Patrick S. McIntosh ’62, one of Kaczynski’s Eliot House suitemates. “He seemed to be okay to talk to at first, but then after a while he wouldn’t connect to anyone else.”
But the uncovering of his connection with a string of bombings that would kill three and injure 23 over 17 years, cementing his status among Harvard’s most infamous alumni, only complicated the memories of Ted Kaczynski for those who knew him in college. For the students he interacted with while at Harvard, Kaczynski had seemed a socially reserved genius, but showed no inclination to violent or revolutionary action.
“It’s just an opinion—but Ted was brilliant,” said Wayne B. Persons ’62, another Eliot suitemate. “I think it was a huge tragedy. He could have become one of the greatest mathematicians in the country. He wasn’t a domestic terrorist when I knew him.”
A RESERVED GENIUS
Kaczynski began his college years in the relative isolation of 8 Prescott Street, currently the Harvard College Writing Program building. Dean of Freshmen F. Skiddy von Stade Jr. ’38 initially began the Prescott housing to accommodate some of the most promising, precocious freshmen in a smaller, more intimate living space, according to an article published in the L.A. Times shortly after Kaczynski’s arrest in April 1996.
But the reality of Prescott as a low-rent housing option led to both a physical and social separation of Kaczynski from the Yard and its more well-to-do students. This isolation seemed to only reinforce Kaczynski’s asocial, serious nature—something that carried over to his move to Eliot N-43 the next year.
Kaczynski’s Eliot suite had formerly served as maids’ quarters before being converted into a room with one of the cheapest rates on campus, Persons explained.
“I didn’t have much money, and at that time, Harvard had different room rates for dormitories,” Persons said. “I went for the absolute bottom.”
Persons and other suitemates recalled Kaczynski holing up in his single, avoiding contact with the other six who shared N-43.
“He would just rush through the suite, go into his room, and slam the door,” McIntosh recalled. “And when we would go into his room there would be piles of books and uneaten sandwiches that would make the place smell.”
Both McIntosh and Persons remembered one of Kaczynski’s distinct rooming tics—playing his trombone late at night.
“And he liked bumping his chair on the wall of my room [while playing],” McIntosh said. “I think he was pretty good at it, just at times he had to tone it down.”
McIntosh recalled that Kaczynski would often eat in the corner of the dining hall, not talking to anyone.
“[We] tried to sit next to Ted to see what he’s like, but he would only sit there for five, 15 seconds, then just get up and go,” McIntosh said. “He would not have anything to do with us.”
But other students recalled Kaczynski being far less socially withdrawn.
John V. Federico ’62, a resident of Eliot House, recalled sitting at the same table with Kaczynski from time to time.
“He was very quiet, but personable,” Federico said. “He would enter into the discussions maybe a little less so than most...but he was certainly friendly. He was younger, and he seemed to be on the shy side, so you needed to make some effort to draw him in. But he could do that.”
Already somewhat distant from other students, Kaczynski seemed to have hinted to his suitemates of his future self-sufficient seclusion in Lincoln, Mont.
“I remember Ted explaining something once on Montana,” Persons said. “He said his father used to take him and his brother camping and taught him advanced outdoor survival skills, which may explain why he was able to live in Montana for so long successfully.”
BECOMING THE BOMBER
After graduating in 1962, Kaczynski chose graduate school and a university job, but only ten years after leaving Harvard he had physically isolated himself from the rest of the world, marking a transition that would set him on the path to the creation of the Unabomber.
Kaczynski earned a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Michigan, becoming an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 before suddenly resigning two years later.
In 1971, he moved into a secluded cabin in Lincoln, Mont., intending to use survival skills to become self-sufficient. But the industrialization and development around his rural retreat would lead him to begin a string of mail bombings.
Over the course of more than a decade of investigation, the FBI dubbed the anonymous terrorist the “Unabomber,” a reference to his targeting of universities and airlines.
By 1995, Kaczynski outlined his call for revolution against industrial society in a 50-page essay, “Industrial Society and Its Future,” threatening further bombings if this “Unabomber Manifesto” remained unpublished.
“The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race,” Kaczynski wrote  in the first line of the Manifesto, published anonymously in The Washington Post and The New York Times in September 1995.
After Kaczynski’s brother, David Kaczynski, read the Manifesto, he began to suspect that his brother was the Unabomber. David Kaczynski turned samples of his brother’s other writings in to the FBI, leading to an arrest on April 3, 1996.
Kaczynski currently serves a life sentence without possibility of parole in a federal supermax prison in Florence, Colo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the child of two Russian-Jewish immigrant parents in 1940s Shanghai, Harvard Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 was no stranger to injustice, a reality that set off his interest in law at an early age.
Living under the rule of imperial Japan, Tribe’s father found himself suddenly arrested after the United States declared war on Japan in December of 1941. As an “alien national,” his only crime was having become a U.S. citizen twenty years ago.
“My sense of what seemed to me the injustice of that imprisonment—after all, he’d done nothing wrong—gave me a lifelong commitment to justice and to the rule of law,” Tribe wrote in an email.
In 1963, one year after graduating from Harvard College, Tribe enrolled in Harvard Law School. Less than a decade later, he had earned tenure at the school, where he would go on to teach future President Barack Obama, Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76, Justice Elena Kagan, and Congressman Barney Frank ’61-’62.
Despite his long-held interests in issues of justice, few who knew Tribe as an undergraduate had any idea that he was destined for a career in law. In college, Tribe was a brilliant mathematician, earning summa on his senior thesis. And in his spare time, he was an artist focusing mainly on what he described as “pastel seascapes and portraits and drawings of real nudes.”
THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR
When Tribe first stepped onto campus as a freshman at the age of 16, he found Harvard to be an eye-opening experience. Neither of his parents had attended college, and, given his humble background, Tribe never attended “a fancy high school,” as he put it.
As a result, the young Tribe was awed by the wide array of new intellectual opportunities he could pursue, as well as “all the amazing women I felt too young to be taken seriously by.”
“I have more fond memories than I could possibly recite in a finite period,” Tribe wrote.
Tribe excelled in his academic studies as an undergraduate, friends remembered. He was especially adept at mathematics, enrolling in graduate courses in the department beginning sophomore year.
“Mind you, he was smarter than practically everyone else we knew in college,” said Stephen M. Jacoby ’62, who lived with Tribe in Greenough during their freshman year.
Friends who knew Tribe said their talented classmate could have succeeded in a number of post-graduate careers. His only defect, Jacoby pointed out, was his absent-mindedness.
“He couldn’t keep track of his debate cards, of simple things like the raincoat,” Jacoby said. “It was the epitome of an absent-minded professor, only he was still quite young at the time.”
THE GREAT DEBATER
Despite concentrating in mathematics, Tribe sustained his interest in law and public policy issues by joining Harvard’s debate team his freshman year.
“Certainly he’d gotten hooked on some of these big public policy issues,” said David L. Mack ’62, one of Tribe’s teammates on the debate team.
“I give him credit for inventing modern debate,” said Albert W. Alschuler ’62, a law professor at Northwestern University and Tribe’s sophomore year debate partner.
As the two were walking down Mass. Ave. one day, Tribe spotted a large sketch pad in the window of an art-supply store, Alshuler remembered. Tribe drew a line down the middle of the pad and used both sides keep track of the two arguments in a competition—a practice still used by debaters today.
That year, Alschuler and Tribe made it to the quarterfinals of the national debate tournament. The very next year, Tribe and another classmate  went on to capture the national debate championship.
“He [became] one of the top debaters on the college circuit,” Mack said.
But Tribe’s love of public policy issues extended beyond the debate tournament circuit. Jacoby and Mack, who also roomed with Tribe in graduate school, both recalled often staying up late at night in their rooms debating public policy issues with him.
A LIBERAL AT HEART
After college, Tribe studied mathematics at Harvard for one year on a National Science Foundation fellowship before he suddenly switched fields and enrolled at the Law School.
According to Alschuler, Tribe’s graduate school roommate, it was the brilliance of fellow classmate and future logician Saul A. Kripke ’62 that convinced Tribe that he could not reach his full potential as a mathematician.
“Larry decided he could never be as good at math as Saul was, but he could easily be as good at law as I was,” Alschuler said.
“I realized that I wanted to do something with more chance of improving people’s lives and that I really wouldn’t make a major impact in the field [of math],” Tribe explained.
And in his career as a legal scholar, Tribe has achieved this level of great influence, particularly in the field of constitutional law. He has appeared before the Supreme Court 35 times, and his 1978 book “American Constitutional Law” was called “the closest thing to a definitive treatise” by The New York Times.
In particular, Tribe is renowned for his support of liberal causes. In the 1986 Supreme Court Case Bowers v. Hardwick, Tribe argued for his client against a Georgia anti-sodomy law.
According to Tribe, his firm belief in racial, gender, and sexual equality, as well as economic justice, have not changed throughout his career.
“I think it has a lot to do with seeing people suffer unjustly as I was growing up,” Tribe wrote.
Mack pointed to a debate trip to the South during their sophomore year as one event that deeply affected Tribe’s commitment to equal rights.
As Tribe traveled to the South for the first time as with his teammates—including Mack and Alschuler—he found himself often using segregated public restrooms and debating at universities that were either still segregated or having trouble adjusting to the recent desegregation of public schools.
“All of us probably started the trip with a liberal view of the race issue, but it is fair to say that we did not feel its emotional weight,” Mack wrote in an email. “That trip probably helped form Larry’s liberal view on equal rights and opportunity under the law.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As an undergraduate at Harvard, former Iowa Senator John C. Culver ’54, also a 1962 graduate of the Law School, took the football team by storm. Barrelling through obstacles and games, he eventually earned himself a spot in the Harvard Football Hall of Fame.
But perhaps the most important result of his time on the football team was the development of a deep friendship between Culver—who decided to apply to Harvard after witnessing a Harvard-Yale game—and teammate Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54-’56, a relationship that would forever connect him with Harvard and its Institute of Politics.
In May 2010, Culver was appointed interim director of the IOP, which Kennedy had established as a living memorial to his brother, President John F. Kennedy ’40. Culver joined its senior advisory committee in 1975.
Until his death in August 2009, Kennedy never missed a meeting of the senior advisory committee. But because of his failing health, he was unable to physically attend his last meeting, so the advisory board, still helmed by Kennedy’s old football buddy, called him in.
“He said he wanted to be recorded present at the meeting because he never missed one,” Culver said.
A PATH TO SERVICE
When he arrived in Cambridge in the fall of 1950, Culver became the third generation of his family to attend Harvard. He began playing freshman football, but, missing his hometown of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, he felt unhappy and almost gave up on the sport in favor of basketball.
“I was kind of homesick,” Culver said, “But by the time I went back there for my sophomore year, I really enjoyed it and was happy at Harvard.”
Culver, who lived in then athlete-oriented Winthrop House, became a star on the football team as a fullback, eventually being inducted to the Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1978 along with his team captain and friend, Richard J. Clasby ’54.
When he was not on the field, Culver fed his growing political interest as a government concentrator, eventually joining the United States Marine Corps for 39 months after graduating.
After, he attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1962.
“When I was an undergraduate, I thought about either going into the foreign service state department or elected politics,” he said. “When I was back at law school, gradually my interest turned more to the political side and the opportunity of running for [public office] eventually won out.”
When Kennedy was elected to the Senate in 1962, he appointed Culver as his legislative assistant. However, it was not long before Culver launched his own political career. After a year in Kennedy’s office, he moved back to Iowa and was elected as a Democrat to the House of Representatives in 1964, only two years after his law school graduation. Culver served in the House from 1965 to 1975 before being elected to the Senate for one term in 1974.
Culver said that he felt fortunate that he was elected in 1964 to the 89th Congress because it had a Democratic supermajority, which allowed Congress to pass landmark legislation including Medicare and Medicaid.
“I think, historically, it’s the most productive two-year period in modern history,” Culver said. “It’s quite a contrast with today where you have a logjam between the two parties.”
‘A STAR IN LIFE’
Today, Culver remains chair emeritus of the IOP’s senior advisory committee.
Former Kentucky Secretary of State C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, who was appointed director of the IOP after Culver’s interim service, said that Culver remains a legend within the organization. He said that when, as a student, Grayson gave reports to the senior advisory committee, Culver and Kennedy made him feel like his ideas mattered and would have an impact.
“I remember my first big report, I guess I was probably 19,” Grayson said, “I called home and was like ‘Mom, I just gave this report and all these senators, and governors, and Senator Kennedy and John Kennedy Jr., they all listened to me.’”
Culver, once a Harvard undergraduate himself, loved working with the students at the IOP as interim director.
“I think that they’re the most stimulating group of young people in the country. Their energy, intelligence, enthusiasm, and commitment to the activities they’re involved in, is remarkable,” Culver said. “It was a wonderful six months working with the students and the staff there.”
This affection was mutual. The staff at the IOP loved him as much as the students did, Grayson said. He added that they still talk about him all the time.
“He was a sports star and he was a star in politics and kind of really a star in life. So that’s why he’s kind of a legend around here,” Grayson said. “My only hope is that when I get out of here after a while, people will talk about me the same way they talk about him.”
“I remember him holding court in his office,” said Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, former president of the student advisory committee at the Institute. “There must have been 20 to 30 students listening to him, in awe, telling his stories of Teddy, when they were students, and this and that.”
“He was an amazing storyteller,” added Solnet.
Sarah E. Esty ’11 served as vice president of the IOP while Culver was interim director.
“He was very supportive of the work we were doing and committed to making sure we expanded new opportunities,” she said. “He really embodied for many of us what it means to dedicate your life to politics and public service.”
So, when Culver was unable to attend the last meeting of the senior advisory committee, the board gave him the same courtesy that he had extended to his old friend Kennedy. At the end of the meeting, Grayson explained, the committee called Culver and checked in on him.
“We told him that for attendance purposes, it counted,” Grayson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Susan E. Milmoe began living with her Radcliffe graduate school roommate—a woman whom everyone called “Peggy” back then—Milmoe was unaware that she wrote poetry.
Peggy wrote “behind closed doors,” Milmoe said, despite having already published a few poems in Canadian literary journals back home.
Little did Milmoe and her other roommate know that the “Peggy” who read their Tarot cards and cooked them meals would become literary legend Margaret E. Atwood.
“If I had realized she was going to be famous, I certainly would’ve paid more attention,” Milmoe joked.
During their time as roommates, Milmoe considered Atwood and her soon-to-be husband, Jim Polk, to be “house parents” and remembered Atwood as a “wonderful cook” who would often listen to her roommates’ quandaries, both academic and romantic.
Today, Atwood is considered one of contemporary literature’s most noteworthy figures, having published over fifty volumes of poetry, children’s literature, fiction, and nonfiction, and having received several notable accolades.
Though Atwood’s time at Radcliffe was littered with obstacles—from gender-based discrimination to cut-throat competition within the English department—she was, and has remained, an unfailingly positive and patient woman.
“You would get the impression, reading some of the novels, that she’s depressive, but that is not at all the case,” Milmoe said. “She’s very much, in my opinion, a ‘lemonade out of lemons’ sort of person.”
When Atwood arrived at Radcliffe in 1961, Harvard had only just begun to admit female graduate students. Women made up only about a quarter of the student body at Harvard, Milmoe recalled.
It was not until 1963—just one year after Atwood received her master’s degree in English—that Radcliffe women were granted Harvard diplomas.
Along with Milmoe and another roommate, Atwood lived in an apartment on Harvard Street while studying at Radcliffe. Though Atwood may not have been affected by the gender-based dormitory segregation of the time, attending Radcliffe still meant facing what Nathalie Cooke, author of “Margaret Atwood: A Critical Companion,” called “a man’s world.”
At that time, women were not allowed to enter Lamont Library, making Harvard’s poetry collection inaccessible to Atwood—an obstacle that, Milmoe said, was “quite a deprivation for Peggy.”
In Atwood’s Victorian Humor course, women had to serve the class tea and cookies during break time.
“Radcliffe must have seemed very different indeed from that atmosphere of her childhood, or that of Victoria College...where she completed her undergraduate degree,” Cooke wrote in an email. “Both were worlds that empowered women.”
Atwood’s interest in gender issues—which would later manifest in her poetry, essays, and fiction—was evident during her graduate studies, according to Atwood’s former classmate Lloyd Schwartz.
Schwartz, who now teaches at the University of Massachusetts Boston, remembered working on a short silent film with his roommate in which Atwood starred.
In the film, a professor wages a revolution with his students, who summon each other to battle with a ram’s horn.
One sequence featured three couples in bed. Of the first two couples, the male members roused themselves from bed to join the battle. Of the third, however, the woman rose to take up arms, leaping from bed and driving off on a motorcycle.
That woman was Atwood.
“Even then, we knew that there was something kind of more adventurous and tougher and more potent about Peggy Atwood than a lot of other women who were graduate students,” Schwartz said. “Peggy was one of those people who really did stand up for her self-respect and power.”
In coming to Radcliffe, Atwood entered an English department that her fellow student Richard M. Dyer recalled as being “very competitive.”
According to Dyer, the department admitted 100 graduate students but only kept 30 of them. In a departmental meeting, students were told to look to their left and right because the people around them were not likely to be there next year, Dyer remembered.
Along with Dyer, Atwood worked as a grader for an English class on the bildungsroman taught by professor Jerome H. Buckley, a man who would later become an adviser and friend of Atwood. Atwood worked as a grader, rather than a teaching fellow, because her Canadian visa prohibited her from getting a work permit.
Though faced with obstacles, Atwood was able to demonstrate her talent for language and writing during her time at Radcliffe.
“We all knew she was talented and vibrant and interesting,” Dyer said. “But I don’t think anyone could’ve predicted what she evolved into.”
Atwood earned her master’s degree from Radcliffe in 1962 but decided to leave Harvard before finishing her doctoral dissertation.
Harvard, however, has remained a source of inspiration for her writing. Her time at Harvard is particularly evident in her feminist novel “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a book set in Harvard Square that aims to make a statement about contemporary gender relations.
For Atwood, writing is a way to combat the challenges—like those she faced at Radcliffe—of everyday life.
“Writing is an act of hope,” Atwood said upon receiving her Radcliffe Medal in 2003. “However gloomy the content of the writing may be, the mere act of putting pen to paper is an act of communication; it presupposes a future reader, and thus a future.”

As a student at Radcliffe College, Elizabeth Holtzman ’62 had her first taste of political organizing. Though Holtzman would later go on to hold some of the highest offices in New York government, here the constituents she was advocating for were her fellow residents of Whitman Hall.
During her senior year, Holtzman helped lead the charge to convince the administration to abolish parietal hours—the 1 a.m. curfews imposed on Radcliffe women but, by the 1960s, rarely enforced.
“It was the beginning of an activist streak,” said Donna L. Walker ’62, who shared the same Radcliffe dormitory as Holtzman.
Only 10 years after graduating from Radcliffe, Holtzman unseated a 50-year incumbent in the New York Democratic primary for the House. At the time, she was the youngest woman to be elected to Congress.
Since then, she has held a variety of offices both within and representing New York City, including serving as the first woman comptroller of the city.
THE RADCLIFFE TRAINING GROUND
During the seven years Holtzman spent at Harvard—four at Radcliffe and the next three at Harvard Law School—she developed her voice as an activist, gaining lessons in organizing that would inform her later political work.
“Extraordinary people are your classmates,” Holtzman said of her time at Radcliffe. “You can learn so much from them. Don’t think it’s just the books and the professors.”
Holtzman was particularly involved in the debate over the ending of Radcliffe’s traditional system of parietal hours.
“The issue was whether we just pretend that we obey [the curfew]...or whether we change the hours so we don’t have to lie,” Holtzman said. “It seemed to me, a senior, that it was a better idea to change the rules and not force people to resort to subterfuges.”
Classmates have remembered Holtzman as a staunch voice during the discussions.
“She was a fierce and passionate advocate for taking these issues seriously and not treating them as a trivial matter,” said Michael Churchill ’61, a former Crimson editor who worked on coverage of the debates. After meeting Holtzman through an article about the parietals question, Churchill struck up a friendship with her, and he eventually served as her congressional campaign manager in 1972.
After graduating from Radcliffe, Holtzman immediately entered Harvard Law School, where she became involved in legal advocacy for the emerging Civil Rights Movement.
“My experiences in the Civil Rights Movement gave me a very deep optimism about the ability to make changes in America for the better,” Holtzman said.
BREAKING IN
Only seven years after her law school graduation, Holtzman officially entered the American political arena with this hope of becoming an advocate for the people.
In 1972, Holtzman won the Democratic primary election for New York City’s 16th district in an upset victory against the 50-year incumbent, Emmanuel Celler. Running against a member of Brooklyn’s political machine, she had neither money nor support from organized groups, even though she had a popular anti-war platform.
“This was very much a grassroots campaign,” Holtzman said.
She said that she won the election by talking to her constituents, a skill that she developed while at Radcliffe. She remembered going wherever there were people—movie theaters, supermarkets, bowling alleys—to shake hands and ask what the people wanted.
“I rarely know anyone with this much energy and ability to pull other people into her campaign,” Churchill said. “She’d go out into a meeting and she’d come back with streams of people.”
“It was a wonderful sort of festive campaign, but it was very hardworking,” he added.
Even though they did not have enough money to run polls or television and radio advertisements, Holtzman said that she won because of her ability to connect with New Yorkers.
“I knew that people in the district wanted something different. We hardly raised any money, but it was a terrific victory,” she said. “If you have an objective, you just go for it, and perhaps I didn’t understand all the obstacles, but I also understood my strengths and the need for someone in government who was going to be honest and an activist who was going to fight hard for the people.”
 ‘A TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE’
Since this first election, Holtzman has been a trailblazer in a range of political offices.
After four terms in the House and a failed Senate bid, Holtzman served as District Attorney of Kings County, New York, and became New York City Comptroller in 1989.
Since 1994, she has been a private practice lawyer in New York.
In addition to breaking several barriers for women as an elected official, Holtzman has also been recognized as an innovator when compared to her predecessors, according to Churchill.
“For me it was a tremendous privilege because I got to stand up for what I believed in, and what I believed in was what my constituents wanted me to do,” she said. “It was a happy conference of my values and theirs.”
For example, she recalled that, as a newly elected House representative, she became involved in debate over a bill that would reduce the number of food stamps available for members of disadvantaged groups.
When a senior Congressman came to the House floor expecting unanimous consent, Holtzman stood up, reserving the right to object.
“He looked up and was like, ‘Huh? What are you doing there? How dare you?’” she said.
Holtzman explained that people were already coming into her office crying and that this bill would only exacerbate this reality. The proposal never became law.
“I’ll never forget how you can make a difference in people’s lives,” Holtzman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congressman Thomas E. Petri ’62 got his first taste of the life of a politician when he was still an undergraduate living in Quincy House.
His senior year, Petri was mistaken for Congressman Frank B. “Brad” Morse, who was scheduled to give a talk at the College.
“Tim came down there, and they thought that he was the Congressman because Congressman Morse hadn’t shown up yet, and he played along with it,” said Bruce K. Chapman ’62, his Quincy House roommate. “Finally the real Congressman came in, and it dawned on the crowd around Tim that he was not the Congressman.”
Petri, now a 17-term congressman for Wisconsin’s 6th district, remains a Wisconsinite at heart. Originally from the small town of Fond du Lac, friends and family say that Petri remains distinctly un-Washingtonian.
“Most people don’t swim around Lake DeNeveu anymore because they are all in their boats,” said his daughter, Alexandra A. Petri ’10, a humor blogger for the Washington Post. “But there’s always this one man swimming in it. That’s my dad.”
“He completely belies the stereotype of people in Congress,” agreed Chapman.
A HARVARD START
Before he even set foot in Harvard Yard, Petri knew he had a burning interest in politics.
“My grandfather always thought that people took the advantageous opportunities that they had in the United States for granted and that you should be as active as you could and take advantage of the opportunities you had,” Petri said.
With a taste for political and leadership organizations, Petri had already participated in Boys State during high school. When he arrived in Massachusetts Hall as a freshman, he joined the campus Republican club and the Student Council. Later, Petri founded the Ripon Society, a Republican political organization for graduate students and young professionals, while serving as a proctor in Thayer Hall.
“He had leadership written all over him from the start,” said Chapman. “He was one of those kids who if you’d gone to high school with him you would have said he’s bound to go into politics someday.”
As a sophomore, Petri joined Quincy House, where he plugged into the politically charged atmosphere.
“One thing that people certainly knew when we were there was that Quincy House was the political house,” Chapman said.
While he concentrated in Government, Petri also had what Chapman called “great economic sense.” From selling milk, sandwiches, cookies, and donuts as late-night snacks to working for Harvard professor B. F. Skinner, Petri worked multiple jobs to help pay for the cost of his education.
Later, these fundraising skills helped start his political career.
“I think he knew that if you are going to go into politics, you need to have some financial underpinnings. He was a careful investor from a very early age, and he thought about it and read about it,” Chapman said.
The politically charged atmosphere on campus in the 1960s also helped shape Petri’s academic and political interests.
“He was excited to be at Harvard and make a difference in the world, and I think that’s true of his friends as well. He always had this tremendous intellectual curiosity,” said Alexandra, a former Crimson editorial columnist.
AROUND THE WORLD
After graduating from the College in 1962, Petri initially considered joining the Peace Corps, but decided to defer his Peace Corps mission to Ethiopia when he was accepted to Harvard Law School.
“I wrote them back and said that if they were interested in having someone with a legal background to let me know in three years, and believe it or not, they did,” Petri said.
After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1965, Petri traveled to Somalia with the Peace Corps.
“He claims that he can make a camel meat curry, but he’s never demonstrated this because we’ve been unable to supply him with camel meat,” said Alexandra, joking about the skills he gained in Somalia.
But Petri also made a tangible impact while abroad. Because of his political and legal experience, he helped organize Somalia’s legal code by translating laws from Italian to English.
“For a young person getting out of Harvard, to be given the chance to help a new country create its laws and legal system was pretty incredible,” Chapman said.
After the Peace Corps, Petri remained in Somalia with the U.S. Agency for International Development to help negotiate the construction for new a waterworks project in Mogadishu, for which he was later recognized by Vice President Hubert Humphrey.
ENTERING THE POLITICAL WORLD
Petri arrived back in the United States ready to enter the political sphere.
He returned to Wisconsin, was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1972, and began a decades-long career as a U.S. Representative in 1979. Soon after, he met his wife Anne D. Neal ’77 through a mutual friend in Washington, D.C. They have one daughter, Alexandra.
“Alexandra is a much more accomplished Harvard student than I,” Petri joked. “I am already known around here as Alexandra Petri’s father.”
Petri’s ties to his Quincy House friends remain strong.
“[Former Quincy roommate J. Eugene] Marans and my dad always get together during the holidays and swap gifts,” said Alexandra. “They might have re-gifted each other the same tie the past seven years.”
And despite his long career, Petri remains the same person at heart.
“I don’t think his personality or beliefs have changed so much as they have deepened,” Chapman said.

On Saturday, noted Harvard dropout and Facebook founder Mark E. Zuckerberg changed his relationship status to “married,” after tying the knot with Priscilla Chan ’07, his longtime girlfriend.
The news created a media frenzy that drew attention away from one of the largest IPOs in history. Zuckerberg and Chan met during their time at Harvard, before he had created Facebook. The couple dated for nine years before marrying the day after Zuckerberg took Facebook public.
Zuckerberg and Chan kept their plans to marry a secret, choosing to reveal the information by publishing a life event on his Facebook page titled “Married Priscilla Chan.” The update was accompanied by a photo of the two holding hands. Zuckerberg wore a suit and tie in lieu of his iconic hoodie while Chan wore a lace white wedding gown.
The couple reportedly invited fewer than 100 people to their home under the guise of a celebration of Chan’s recent graduation from the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. But the guests soon learned that they had been invited to a wedding instead.
“It’s good for him that he could maintain a life that was not completely public,” said Max Wang ’13, who interned for Facebook last summer.Zuckerberg reportedly designed Chan’s wedding ring himself, which featured a simple ruby, according to the Huffington Post.
The food at the wedding was reportedly catered by the couple’s favorite local sushi restraurant. For dessert, the couple served mice shaped chocolates from LA Burdick, the very sweets that they had eaten together on their first date in Harvard Square.
Some thought it was only a matter of time until the two were wed.“I am not at all surprised that they got married,” said Erica A. Sheftman ’12, who worked as a communications intern at Facebook last year.
“You could tell that Mark had a lot of respect for her,” said Wang.Back in the early years of Facebook, The Crimson managed to capture a few early moments between the now-married couple.
“‘Hey Priscilla, do you want a job at the facebook?,” Zuckerberg asked in a 2005 Crimson article. Chan responded favorably, reportedly offering him a Twizzler.

The path leading up to the Senior Barbecue was littered with empty plastic cups and water bottles as hundreds of graduating seniors enjoyed macaroni and cheese, corn bread, and beer at the final event of this year’s Senior Week on Sunday evening.
Kicking off with a picnic along the Charles River on Friday, May 11, the week included a trip to Six Flags, a viewing of “Love Story,” and the annual Last Chance Dance.
Sunday’s activities began with the Senior Olympics, a final, fierce competition between the Houses.
“There was a lot of House spirit,” said Julia M. Eger ’14, a senior week student coordinator. “The whole grade chanted, ‘We hate Winthrop,’” during tug-of-war.
Despite the lack of crowd support, Winthrop House won the majority of the Senior Olympic events and ultimately took the first place trophy. Winthrop dodgeball champion William A. Keuper ’12 celebrated by drinking out of the cup.
“We win the Intramural Cup every year,” he said. “Other houses hate us.”
But for many, Senior Week was less about competition and more about closure. Second Class Marshal Lange P. Luntao ’12 emphasized that the week “really does build a sense of community.”
Luntao pointed to tools such as Match12, a computer algorithm that matched seniors based on a list of their twenty crushes within the class, as a way to bring students together one last time.
“It has been wonderful seeing people at the Last Chance Dance and Soirée connecting with their crushes and hopefully creating legacies,” Luntao said. “Events such as the Talent Show really remind seniors of what an incredible group of peers we have.”
Senior Week also featured an outing to Foxwoods Casino, a moonlight cruise, and a talent show, among other events.
“The coolest part is that we do a lot of the traditional events, like Harvard Olympics, and new events, like the first annual scavenger hunt,” said Bonnie Cao ’12, the first class marshal and former vice president of the Undergraduate Council. The scavenger hunt required seniors to run around Boston and act out scenes from “The Social Network” and “Legally Blonde.”
Some blocking groups took Senior Week events to the next level. Eger said she had heard of some blocking groups creating “punch cards” for a competition of how many hook ups they could have by the end of the week.
Julia A. Moore ’12 called the dance floor of Club Royale in Boston at the “Last Chance Dance” an “ice skating rink,” with seniors spilling their drinks and “slipping and falling.”
“UHS was so full that they closed the open bar” at the club, Leslie A. Rea ’12 joked.
But the week was also about keeping people “connected in a meaningful way,” according to Moore. This week, a group of students began recruiting for Launch 2012, an initiative that seeks to connect the senior class after graduation through work on a global social issue.
And for those who can remember, the good times from Senior Week will remain.
“I wish it was Senior Year, not Senior Week,” Moore said.

Ten finalists for the President’s Challenge showed demos of their social entrepreneurship projects to a large crowd at the Innovation Lab on Friday evening.
The ten final teams, who were chosen from a pool of over 170, have the chance to win part of a $100,000 pot, split among up to four teams. The winning team will be announced later this month by University President Drew G. Faust.
The finalists ranged from Harvard freshmen to graduate students. Their projects covered a broad range of innovative ideas within five predetermined categories—clean water, personal health, empowering education, global health, and clean air.
One of the teams, called Team Slum Sanitation Solutions, is composed of three freshmen whose goal is to improve the quality of life in certain slum areas by providing toilet systems in every household.
“[In some places], there’s no sewer system; no sanitation at all,” said Erik C. Schluntz ’15, one of the team members. “We started looking at serious problems and we found that sanitation was one of the most serious.
”They plan on providing households with a bucket-like toilet that will be collected and emptied every day. Another project took a unique approach to social problems by developing a prototype for a communications device that would allow people to send and receive scents through electronic chips attached to objects such as cell phones.
“We think it’s a really powerful dimension to the experience of communication,” said Ruirui Kuang ’12. “The power of scent can be harnessed to combat weight gain or help someone manage their weight.
”For their demo at the I-Lab, the team created a video showing the way the world would be like if their product were commonly used. Team Revolving Fund Pharmacy—a team that has created a financial plan to provide Kenyans with easy access to medicine—has already begun implementing their idea.
“We piloted three sites and served 17,000 patients,” said Kristin Huang, a team member and Harvard Medical School student. “We are hoping to expand with the eventual goal of convincing the Kenyan government to adopt this type of financial model for pharmacies.” She said that she and other team members came up with the idea after spending a year in Kenya.
Other projects covered a wide-spectrum of topics, from self-sustaining water filter factories to interactive electronic textbooks to a car-sharing business for Indian cities. All of the teams say they plan to continue to work on their projects even if they do not win a share of the prize money.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Caitlin E. Carey ’12 returned to her Lowell House room last Monday, in the midst of celebrating Senior Week and preparing to graduate this Thursday, she found that most of her possessions had disappeared.
Earlier that day she had received a call from a Dorm Crew captain, who said his crew had mistakenly discarded the belongings in her room, Carey said. He told her that after they had lunch, his crew would return the garbage bags containing her possessions to her room. But when Carey returned, she said that she found far less than had been taken.
“This really friggin’ sucks,” Carey said. “This is supposed to be my Senior Week, and instead all my stuff is gone and I have to buy everything again. I can’t hang out with my friends.”
Harvard Recycling and Waste Management had taken her bags from the Lowell donation area less than half an hour before she returned, Carey said. The waste management workers had seemingly forgotten the bags that remained.
“I think it’s possible that some of it made it to the Habitat donation station,” said Juliet N. Macchi ’12, a Dorm Crew head captain.
Carey said that a worker at the Habitat for Humanity collection center told her that she did not receive anything from the Lowell donation area. Carey added that she believes her belongings may have been looted by private individuals, a claim that Macchi dismissed as a rumor.
Carey has filed an insurance claim for her losses and received some money from Lowell’s Senior Common Room fund.
Following the incident, Carey said she learned that her suite had originally been recorded as being in a different entryway, then “fixed” to the suite next to hers, so that her real room was recorded vacant.
Because Carey is graduating early by activating her advanced standing option, all of her junior roommates had moved out. As a result, it appeared that her room had belonged to a student who left without taking anything.
Macchi said that Dorm Crew only cleans rooms that have been designated as “available” on their lists and even confers with the building manager if a room appears as if someone is still living there.
“Our goal is not to kick people out or take people’s stuff,” Macchi said. “We try to be as considerate as possible.”
Carey commended Dorm Crew’s handling of the situation and said that she could not place blame on anyone.
“I want to be mad at someone because all of my stuff is gone, but I can’t, because everyone was so nice to me,” Carey said. “It wasn’t just one person’s fault.”
Lowell Building Manager Robert Sammonds could not be reached for comment.

Launch 2012, a new website created by a group of Harvard seniors, aims to connect the Class of 2012 after graduation through public service and positive social change.
The group will encourage members of the Class of 2012 to continue to work on a social justice cause chosen by members of the class. “Our mission is to enable the Harvard Class of 2012 to connect and collaborate for greater positive social impact post graduation,” the group’s website explains.
The groups’ founders have been present at Senior Week events to ask seniors to vote for the social issue that will unite their classmates after graduation. Options include economic empowerment, global health, environment, education, and human rights. “We appreciate the experiences we’ve had and all the opportunities that we’ve been given at Harvard,” said Catherine C. Doherty ’12, Launch 2012 co-founder and the group’s head of strategy and communications. “We want to give back beyond the Harvard community and we want to stay connected.”
The project, pitched and developed for a class on social entrepreneurship, has already received over 750 votes in one week to determine its chosen social issue. Founders said they are aiming for at least 1,000 votes from members of the class of 2012. “We want this to be a very true vote of what our class wants,” said Julia L. Moore ’12, another co-founder.
The leadership team has grown from a few founders to 25 seniors.“It was a very team-oriented process,” Doherty said.The founders said they hope that the initiative will grow even more as seniors sign up to be city captains, volunteering to host public service events pertaining to the decided social issue in cities across the world. The founders hope to announce the social issue that their class voted on after graduation.
“Launch 2012 is going to help us build our social events into service events in the upcoming years,” Second Class Marshal Lange P. Luntao ’12 said. “Our Harvard 2012 classmates are the best resources we have.”
In the future, the group’s leaders hope to partner with the Phillips Brooks House Association and to encourage other undergraduate classes to join them in this project.
“Just meeting people at the events this week, there’s been a lot of underclassmen still around and they come up and ask ‘What is this? Tell me more,’” said Moore. “It’s definitely something that we want people to run with like future classes at Harvard.”
