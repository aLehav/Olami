After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Broad City” is not usually the show you’d watch if you want to cry. For emotional trauma as a result of George R. R. Martin callously killing off your favorite character, “Game of Thrones” is a much better choice. But in its eighth episode of the season, “Broad City” carries through the commitment to development that it manifested in the previous episode and includes one of the most affecting scenes aired on a comedy show in recent memory. As earlier episodes foreshadowed, Lincoln decides to break up with Ilana and begin a monogamous relationship with the other girl he had been dating—and Ilana’s attempts to avoid the conversation, while hilarious (“We haven’t even had a threesome with a boy yet”), are also touchingly vulnerable.
But nothing else in the episode comes close to the emotional gravity of Ilana’s breakdown at the end of the episode when she tearfully tells Abbi what happened between her and Lincoln. In the context of Ilana’s relentlessly casual approach to their relationship, from which her interactions with Lincoln derive a great deal of their humor, this scene verges on heartbreaking. Not tearing up when Ilana admits to Abbi, “And he doesn’t even want to be friends, you know, he never really did. I just never heard it,” would be an impressive feat of stoicism. Part of what makes Ilana so appealing as a character is her indefatigable happy-go-lucky attitude; that Glazer and Jacobson have, nearly a full three seasons into the show, allowed her to cry brings a poignant emotional payoff.
This being “Broad City,” however, the episode has its fair share of clever comedy, although the tone of the episode is ultimately defined by its final few scenes. The episode’s climax, in which Abbi gets trapped simultaneously on a date with Trey and attending Ilana’s parents’ anniversary dinner, pays brilliant homage to “Mrs. Doubtfire.” A scene earlier in the episode, in which Bevers reveals a surprising understanding of fashion, is one of the character’s best in the show thus far. Nor does this episode skimp on social commentary: A moment in which Ilana stops hooking up with a stranger when she learns he is married nicely elucidates the difference between an open relationship and cheating.
But it’s the episode’s closing that best encapsulates its tone. Sitting in a bathtub together and getting stoned, Abbi and Ilana confess the secrets they have kept from each other. The scene upholds much of the episode’s earlier emotional purchase—”I was starting to kinda like Trey,” says Abbi. “Like, like like”—but it also emphasizes what is, and has always been, at the core of “Broad City.” This episode is emotionally significant not merely because of the relationship issues that Abbi and Ilana go through but because, at the end of it all, they are still stubbornly there for each other.

UPDATED: April 13, 2016, at 3:55 p.m.
“SHE,” an original musical revue, weaves together vignettes and music to explore aspects of modern womanhood ranging from lighthearted moments of friendship and mountain climbing to pregnancy scares and the aftermath of sexual assault. Inspired by true stories and featuring a cast of over 20 Harvard women, “SHE” will run April 14 and 15 in the Oberon Theater.
According to songwriter and composer Liz P. Kantor ’18, the show was first conceived in December 2014, in the face of a spring semester relatively lacking in dramatic opportunities for women. “The guys had the opportunity to be in the Pudding, but that just wasn’t something we had access to. So one of my friends, Ally [M.] Kiley [’15], came to me and asked me if I wanted to music-direct a show of songs that all passed the Bechdel test.” Despite the fact that the production focuses on women, Kantor believes that the show is one for and about everyone. “We came up with this tagline: ‘By women, about women, for everyone,’” says Kantor. “We all want this to be something that is accessible to audiences of all ages, genders, races, sexualities, everything.”
With every scene based on a personal experience from either a member of the cast or an acquaintance, “SHE” looks to deliver a potent emotional punch. Actor Lindsey C. Ruggles ’19 says that the true-to-life nature of the show has been an especially demanding aspect of her role. “The most challenging part is just making sure that you honor people and their stories,” she says. “You want to make sure that you’re doing justice to somebody else’s life.”
Ultimately, however, Ruggles sees the show as joyous. “People go through difficult things, and they go through happy times and sad times and that can be really great and really upsetting,” she says, “but I hope that people see it as a whole range of life experiences. I hope that the biggest thing people take away from this is the strength of every person and every character in the show, and that that translate[s] to life as well.”

“Living in the present’s got us feeling gray; we’re dreaming of a yesterday,” sings a chorus in Renaissance-era costumes. The class of 2019’s take on the annual freshman musical, or “froshical,” will carry audiences far from the fast-paced, high-powered world of Harvard to the Kalamazoo County Renaissance Fair. The culmination of months of collaboration among the newest members of Harvard’s theater community, “All’s Fair! at the Kalamazoo County Renaissance Festival” will run from April 14 to 17 at the Agassiz Theater.
“Froshical is a totally organic process,” says producer Henry M.N. Brooks ’19; according to him, the “core team” of each year’s show—producer, director, lyricist, composer, and book writer—selects its successors through an application process. This year, the core team is Brooks, Mitch B. Polonsky ’19, Allison S. Chang ’19, Scott Roberts ’19, and Landy Erlick ’19, respectively.
“The concept came from the five of us sitting around a table, saying, ‘What do we want to write a musical about?’, and a Renaissance fair [is] a fun thing to explore,” Polonsky says. The plot that resulted from that exploration follows Rose (Sara Bobok ’19), an aspiring big-time actress who joins the acting troupe of the titular Renaissance festival, as she contends with the distance between her dreams of stardom and the realities of her situation.
“Historically, Froshical is known for [being] very campy,” Polonsky says. But although Brooks and Polonsky agree that “All’s Fair!” prioritizes comedy, the show also looks to highlight the weighty themes of Rose’s story. “I want people to be able to walk away and have a new lens for themselves to think about their own dreams and their own expectations and the compromises they’ve had to make in their own lives,” Polonsky says, “and I think [‘All’s Fair!’] provides a framework to do that.”
Bobok finds Rose to be an especially relatable character for Harvard students. “I think a lot of people come into Harvard with huge dreams, which is an incredible thing,” she says, “and realistically there are a lot of obstacles for their dreams. At some times, it may just seem so unrealistic that those are going to come true. And I think Rose knows that. However, she’s able to maintain this unbelievable optimism as she goes through the show, and she’s just cracking jokes and being her genuine self.”
Brooks hopes that audiences will find meaning not only in Rose’s story but also in the nature of the freshman musical itself. “Froshical is everywhere. Froshical is Harvard, in a neat way: There are so many people involved in this show, all the way from our lead actors to the person taking our publicity photos or the people painting our set, that everybody already knows somebody who’s in the freshman musical,” he says. “It’s everybody’s show.”

G. K. Chesterton, in his 1929 book The Thing, wrote of reforming institutions: “[Imagine] a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ‘I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.’ To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: ‘If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.’”
Harvard’s a funny place. In the span of a single day, I can attend a lecture about securing the University’s computer systems from foreign hackers by Jim Waldo, Harvard’s Chief Technical Officer and, just a few hours later, read an article in The Crimson about the Undergraduate Council’s uninformed request that Harvard postpone its plans to upgrade the same outdated password system that makes it difficult to defend the school’s computers.
In a classic Harvard-student move, the UC waited for almost five months after the HarvardKey transition was made available to ask for an extension, requesting in a letter to Harvard University Information Technology “that the deadline be moved to some point in the summer.” Moreover, this request was made under the mistaken belief that the final deadline “occurs when students will be completing midterms and preparing for finals.” After the story broke, HUIT clarified that students would in fact have until June 1 to claim their HarvardKey; the April 20 deadline is for faculty, staff, and other non-student members of FAS only.
Though the UC called for a postponement, not a destruction of HarvardKey, it is nevertheless clear that the majority of UC representatives do not see the use of this particular fence, even as they call for it to be cleared away. The Crimson reported that “many representatives arguing that the body should first speak to HUIT before passing any legislation on the matter” were outvoted 20-16. If any of the representatives had been taking Professor Waldo's class, however, they might have been able to provide a greater understanding of the password system's importance.
For College students and many other users, HarvardKey appears to have little to recommend it, besides a splashy background image featuring Winthrop’s back gate. But beneath the surface, it’s a lynchpin of HUIT’s strategy to keep Harvard’s computers safe from cyberattacks.
A 2013 feature article by the Crimson reported that Harvard “undergoes a barrage of cyberattacks every single day,” from sources ranging from recreational hackers to military groups sponsored by the Syrian, Russian, and Chinese governments. Breaches at the Kennedy School, at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, at a Law School clinic, and of central administration resources have exposed sensitive information and systems across the University. In the same article, The Crimson reported that “there are a multitude of technology services groups across the University, and Harvard’s size and segmentation may make fending off cyberattacks more difficult.”
HarvardKey significantly strengthens password-protected resources across the University by unifying a dozen separately managed, outdated, and insecure password databases into a single, secure system. Professor Waldo elicited outright laughter from his class during Monday’s lecture when he described the lack of technical sophistication of the pre-HarvardKey systems; at office hours afterwards, he explained that the multitude of ways to change your password in the HUID/PIN system formerly used for College students led to a system that was “inevitably, eventually inconsistent.”
But I shouldn’t have to explain all of this for the benefit of the UC in an op-ed in The Crimson. We expect—or should expect—that our elected representatives endeavor to be informed about the issues at play when they pass legislation. At the very least, we should hope that they refrain from going out of their way to take on vocal positions regarding issues they know that they are uninformed about. In the words of UC representative Daniel Levine: “It’s unprofessional for [the] Council to send a really combative statement to a Harvard office without doing the legwork of reaching out to them to hear their side of the story.”
And claim your HarvardKey before June 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Housing Day, freshmen inevitably bemoan being sorted into the Radcliffe Quadrangle, often citing the distance between the Quad, the Yard, and the River Houses as a main source of their discontentment. While shuttles travel between the Quad and locations across campus relatively frequently, location-based discontentment with the Quad persists.
But a new pilot project is aimed at making living in the Quad more convenient. Recently, Pforzheimer House resident William B. Keith ’16 organized an initiative to pilot a new Quad-Harvard Yard shuttle route. The route passes exclusively between the Quad and the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Garden Street, allowing the bus to travel back and forth in 10 minutes, compared with the 20 minutes that the existing Quad Express shuttle takes to make the trip due to a stop at Memorial Hall. This shorter trip is certainly a welcome addition for residents of the Quad.
We are glad to see the implementation of the pilot project and hope that it leads to the permanent institution of the new route. The ability to consistently travel between the Yard and the Quad quickly and efficiently also has the potential to improve the community in the Quad, with students more easily able to return for lunch during the academic day. In addition, we should note that this change will also allow freshmen and residents of the River Houses to get to know the Quad, an opportunity we hope they take full advantage of.
This new shuttle service also works to the advantage of students who require accessible transportation. While the buses are all technically wheelchair accessible, more direct service means that buses will be less crowded and that students can move between the Quad and the Yard more easily.
When Keith surveyed students to test their level of support last August, he found that approximately 96 percent of the more than 300 respondents were in favor of the shorter route. “This particular route isn’t going to cost more, money-wise, but it’s something that shuttle drivers have to adjust to,”  Keith said. Given the extensive student support and the ability to provide the service at no new cost, the implementation of the additional route simply makes sense.
Though we fully support this change, it should not lead to any changes in the dining accommodations Quad students receive on the River. While Quad residents will be able to get back to their House dining halls more quickly, many will still need to stay in the area of the Yard and the River for lunch and dinner.
Beyond its potential to create a small but meaningful change in the lives of students, this effort is also an excellent example of the University listening to student requests and taking action in conjunction with advocacy and initiative from the Undergraduate Council. While occasional hiccups occur in the relationship between the UC and the University—like the recent confusion over the timing of the implementation of the new HarvardKey security system—communication between the two can lead to creative ideas. We hope to see regular Quad shuttle trips along this new route, and more cooperation on similar projects, soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, two black men kissed each other on the Loeb Mainstage for what was probably the first time ever, and a crowd that was seemingly more than predominantly black and brown  completely lost it.
Last weekend, more black and brown people packed into that giant, intimidating theatre than have almost certainly ever been in that building at the same time ever before—at least more than I or anyone I talked to had ever seen in even the most “diverse” crowds.
Last weekend, I was, for the first time in my life, in a theatrical audience composed of more nonwhite people than white people, a room of people of color that fell in love with gay, bisexual, and genderqueer black characters while the characters fell in love with each other. None of the characters died.
I believe in magic.
Often, the white people in charge of producing and controlling the mediocre white theatre that dominates this campus and this world excuse the overwhelming whiteness of their productions by claiming that black people simply don’t come out to audition for theatre—and they certainly don’t come out to watch it.
“Black Magic” on the Loeb Mainstage sold hundreds and hundreds of tickets to black people to see this show. Many people saw it multiple times. Auditions were packed. This is what happens in response to art that prioritizes intentional representation. This is what happens when there are actually roles for black people in shows by black people: roles that aren’t token, roles besides the mammy or the wet nurse or the maid.
I don’t simply mean to brag, though I am immensely proud to have been a part of this. I simply mean to praise. Black people are magic. Black creativity is magic. Personally, I am leaving this production feeling more empowered than ever before about art-making on this campus. It is something of a revolutionary disenchantment—why did I ever feel the need to be accepted by powerful white publications, organizations, exclusive social spaces, when something so much more genuine, thoughtful, and creative exists? There’s just something so un-creative about the racist persistence of maintaining the status quo when it comes to the color—and gender, and sexuality—of art.
I owe this empowerment in large part to the leaders of Black C.A.S.T. who fought tooth and nail for space and recognition on this campus. And perhaps that is it—I shouldn’t really admonish mediocrity, as I cannot blame a people for never having to fight for their art. But I can celebrate the fight—I can celebrate the black women that have made Black C.A.S.T. what it is. I can celebrate the black queer folks who are making it what it will be. I can celebrate all the black, all the magic, and all the fight. We have earned all of it.
And isn’t this the purest joy? Praise God, for we have fought a holy fight, we have created something pleasing to our people and to our sweat and to our tears. For we have created something healing, a salve for the black and queer bodies around us and the black and queer bodies that no longer can be. Praise God, a bottle of pink moscato after a literally historic opening night and a buzzing and unspoken acknowledgment of a great and radiant something that has just passed between us, within us.
Praise God, for how far I have come. For how far my people have come. For how far I have to yet go. Praise God for a brow furrowed in Act I at the use of gender-neutral pronouns relaxing entirely by Act II as queer black love washes over it. For this has been a cleansing.
We aren’t just coming. We are already here. And we’re making art that you might not understand. Making art that you might not even make the time to come see—and it won’t matter. Because it’s not for you, anyway.
And  today, for me, it’s not even really about that. It’s about giving thanks. It’s about opening myself up to magic.

UPDATED: April 12, 2016, at 11:44 p.m.
Police arrested several members of the student activist group Divest Harvard after they staged a sit-in within the lobby of  the Boston Federal Reserve Tuesday afternoon, protesting Harvard Management Company’s investment in the fossil fuel industry.
Four members of Divest Harvard protested in the building, which houses HMC, the University’s investment arm that manages its $37.6 billion endowment. Members of Divest Harvard identified the arrested protesters as  Naima Drecker-Waxman ’18, Applied Physics graduate student Benjamin Franta, School of Public Health student Rory Stewart, and  Adam Cory Vander Tuig, a student at the Divinity School and Memorial Church seminarian.
About 25 students, faculty members, and alumni who support Divest Harvard held a rally outside of the building at the same time.
The four students had been sitting for about one to two hours before being escorted out of the building, according to Harvard Law School student Joseph “Ted” E. Hamilton, a plaintiff in a case against the University some members of the group filed in 2014.
Boston Police Department spokesperson Myeshia Henderson said that police had been dispatched to the Boston Federal Reserve building, located at 600 Atlantic Avenue in downtown Boston. She confirmed that four protesters had been arrested at the Federal Reserve building.
Harvard Law School student Kelsey C. Skaggs, a Divest Harvard member in attendance, said only four members of the group actually protested inside the lobby  in order to avoid blocking normal access to the building, which also houses the Consulates General of Italy and Japan.
University President Drew G. Faust has held a firm stance against divesting from fossil fuel companies, even while facing numerous sit-ins and demonstrations by students, alumni, and faculty affiliated with Divest Harvard. She argues that Harvard’s endowment is not an instrument for political and social activism and that the University can best contribute to combating climate change through research and teaching.
“Like many peer institutions, Harvard is already acting on climate change through research that occurs across disciplines and throughout the world; through teaching and learning, by providing our students with the tools to confront this issue for generations to come; and on our campus, where we have already reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20 percent,”  University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement.
Tuesday’s protest comes a little more than a month after Divest Harvard sent a letter to HMC President and CEO Stephen Blyth requesting a meeting to discuss the company’s policies and paths towards “sustainable investing.”
Skaggs said Divest Harvard has wanted to appeal directly to HMC for a while.
“Harvard Management Company is the entity that actually does the day-to-day work investing in fossil fuel companies,” Skaggs said. “So we thought it would be appropriate to take our message to this other important actor.”
Last spring, Divest Harvard was notably vocal in its efforts to pressure Harvard into removing its investments in the fossil fuel industry, staging a week-long blockade of Massachusetts Hall—which houses the offices of the University's central administration—they called “Heat Week.” Since then, the group has remained more quiet on campus and began a semester-long effort to refocus the group’s goals and tactics.
On Tuesday, Yale announced it would begin divesting its $25.6 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies, two years after its chief investment officer, David F. Swensen, wrote a letter to Yale’s investment managers asking them to consider “the impact of climate change essential when evaluating investment opportunities.”

Dudley House’s airy second-floor offices overlooking the Yard will be filled with students and writing fellows next fall after the creation of a new “Center for Writing and Communicating Ideas” for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
A director and three writing fellows will staff the center, which will specialize in the sciences, the arts and humanities, or the social sciences respectively. GSAS Associate Dean of Academic Programs and Diversity Sheila Thomas said in addition to these fellows, who likely will be postdoctoral fellows, current graduate students might serve as tutors.

Before the Center’s creation, students seeking writing help could reach out to Suzanne E. Smith, a writing tutor for over 4,000 students in GSAS who will direct the new center. She currently works as a writing tutor half-time, dedicating the rest of her time to her position as a History and Literature lecturer.
“I can’t really accommodate the demand most of the time,” Smith said.
Smith regularly shoulders a bag packed with sheets of student writing. She has worked as the writing tutor since 2006 and said working with a team of fellows trained in different disciplines will be “wonderful.”
“I’m actually, at this point, comfortable reading anything by anyone, but having said that, my background is decidedly in the humanities rather than in the natural sciences, or quantitative disciplines, or social sciences,” Smith said.
Although she primarily works with dissertators, Smith said a significant number of first-years or international students have sought her help.
Weichu Wang, a Chinese master’s student in the Regional Studies East Asia, voiced concerns about her perceived lack of graduate level writing support to her representative on the Graduate Student Council, fellow master’s student Jannis Chen.
"As an international student, I (as well as many of my colleagues across disciplines) found Harvard’s writing resources disappointedly limited for graduate-level non-native speakers of English,” Wang wrote to Chen in a February email.
In the 2014-2015 academic year, 34 percent of GSAS students came from international backgrounds. Chen, who is also an international student, said some internationals seek grammatical edits, which the current writing services do not provide.
“In order to correct the grammar and things like that for an international student, they have to engage services from an outside proofreader who is not really affiliated with Harvard. That definitely will incur extra cost,” Chen said.
Smith said she tries to help international students become more acquainted with the sound and prose of English. She added that she once worked with a student from rural China studying biochemistry who reached out to her for help with his memoir.
“Does it present a particular set of challenges? Yes,” Smith said. “Can those challenges be addressed very effectively? Yes, as evidenced by this student who not only developed his English to the point that it was functional, but to the point that it was literary.”
Before the announcement of the new center, Chen said GSAS lagged behind writing resources that exist at the undergraduate level. Undergraduates have access to the Harvard College Writing Center, which matches students in need of help with trained peer tutors in addition to providing appointments and drop-in hours.
“In the perfect world...there would be some kind of integration between the undergraduate writing center and the graduate writing center, but I think initially the focus has to be on how to serve the graduate students,” Thomas said.
Smith said that her positions within the College and GSAS have given her a unique lens to help other students.
“I constantly ask myself what’s working in the College that is also working or maybe not working so well in the context of the Graduate School,” she said.
Thomas said GSAS Dean Xiao-li Meng prioritized  “professional development and communication in the broad sense—both from the writing side, as well as from the oral presentation side.”
Administrators planned the Center nearly two years ago and repurposed its current space on the second floor of Dudley House around that time, according to GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to student concerns over slow exit times, the Cabot Science Library recently ended its mandatory bag check policy.
The Library removed routine bag checks in an attempt to save patrons' time, according to Susan M. Fliss, Associate University Librarian for Research, Teaching and Learning.
“We heard from students and from other Harvard community members that having one’s bag checked slows down your exit time from the library and people feel uncomfortable having their bags looked at,” she said.
Historically, libraries in the Harvard system have adopted the policy of mandatory bag checks in order to maintain the security of their collection, but Fliss said some other libraries are looking to adopt the bag-check policy change as well.
“We are working on being able to do [this] for Lamont,” she said. Other libraries may require more consultation with University affiliates, she added.
Fliss acknowledged that in the face of the removal of the bag checking policy, librarians have begun devising new methods to protect library items.
“We are looking at ways to make sure that the collections are still safe and also to allow the people to exit the building more quickly,” Fliss said.
Several students said the policy change was unexpected, yet a pleasant surprise.
It took Juliet T. Bramante ’18 a little while to realize that Cabot Library, located in the Science Center, had officially stopped checking bags.
“I figured they were just busy for a while,” she said. “It’s nice for me; I understand why they would check bags, but I like not having to.”
Edgar Gonzalez, Jr. ’19, another library patron, said the change made it more convenient for him to access the library printers.
“Well, I usually come here to study and I don’t even ever check out any books from here,” he said. “I either print or I study. So just walking in and coming out just makes it easier because I never have any books.”
For the most part, some students lauded the possibility of removing back checks at more libraries.
“If it doesn’t mean that more people are stealing books, then, yeah, why not?” Bramante said.

Ahead of next week’s New York primaries, Harvard’s Democratic student groups hope to gain momentum as they continue their phone bank efforts for upcoming primary states.
The Harvard Democrats’ Campaigns Committee, which is not affiliated with a particular presidential candidate, has focused its attention on uncontested primaries in local elections, while presidential candidate subgroups—like Harvard Students for Bernie and Harvard Students for Hillary—have continued support for their candidates, Democrats President Susan X. Wang ’17 said.
“The Dems collectively haven’t been doing much primary campaigning because we leave that to the subgroups,” she said. “We’ve been focused on more local campaigns where there aren’t two democrats running against each other.”
Going forward, the Harvard Democrats will focus on making sure all students on campus are registered to vote in Massachusetts or in their home state for the general election.
In the last seven primary elections and caucuses, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has defeated former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, in some cases winning by a double digit margin. This surge in wins for Sanders has led to a continued interest in the election, which Wang considered “exciting.”
Despite Sanders’s recent victories, turnout for Harvard Students for Bernie’s events has dwindled after the Massachusetts and New Hampshire primaries when students were able travel to the states and meet with voters in person.
Sanders supporters are gearing up for the New York primaries, where Clinton, a former Senator from New York, leads polls by 14 percent, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Bernie supporters have “definitely been making a concerted effort to recapture that enthusiasm,” Justin G. Curtis ’19, vice president of Harvard Students for Bernie, said.
“As a club, we really talk a lot about the decreased turnout at the phonebanks. But, as a group, we’re not discouraged about Bernie’s chances at securing the nomination,” Alice S. Rossmann ’19, a member of Harvard Students for Bernie, said. “Bernie, himself, has said that he’s going to fight all the way to the nominating convention, and we’re sort of holding that same mentality.”
The organization continues to hold phonebanks every Wednesday, where a group of six or seven students usually meet in what has become a “routine” for the group, according to Curtis.
Harvard Students for Hillary have continued to phone-bank into states with upcoming primaries or caucuses.
“We’ve focused on growing our numbers on campus through social media and through postering,” Michael A. Kikukawa ’17, outreach captain of Harvard Students for Hillary, said.
On campus, the group has diverted its attention to rallying the support of dedicated Clinton supporters who have not previously been involved in the campaign.
According to Kikukawa, several Harvard alumni are now working in Pennsylvania on the Clinton campaign and have made contact with the group on campus.
“We’ve been making phone calls into Pennsylvania because lots of Harvard grads and alumni who are working with the campaign are organizers there,” he said. “Of course, it’s also a very large and competitive state and a general election swing state too, so that is very useful to the campaign if we were to win the primary.”
While she is a Clinton supporter, Wang said she hopes that supporters from both sides will rally around the Democratic nominee, whomever that individual may be.
“The alternative is Ted Cruz or Donald Trump which I think everybody can agree is much worse than their non-preferred Democratic nominee,” Wang said.

While students said they have noticed sporadic Wi-Fi disconnections in recent weeks , the Harvard University Information Technology office has seen no evidence of wide-ranging disruptions.
There have been three outages since January, according to HUIT spokesperson Acacia Matheson. The longest reported disconnection occurred over spring break in the Radcliffe Quadrangle, with wireless coverage restored "in hours."

Several students said they have noticed sporadic disconnections more frequently in the past few weeks, especially on their mobile devices.
Claire M. Rivkin ’19 said she has previously lacked access to the internet while working on an important project for class within Harvard Yard.
“I was actually trying to work on an important project where I needed to look up a lot of [video] clips, and the Wi-Fi cut off for about 45 minutes in the Yard. Which was just absurd,” she said. “It really just can’t happen when people are doing work that could be due in a few hours,”
Hannah E. Hardenbergh ’19 said she experienced her first wireless disconnections last Thursday while trying to watch a movie with her roommate on her laptop, although she said she has frequently experienced difficulties connecting to the Wi-Fi on her phone.
“Sometimes my phone will knock me out of the Harvard University Wi-Fi, and I have to find it again,” she said. “I’ve experienced this a lot of times.”
Matheson wrote that HUIT incidence reports showed no evidence of a systematic problem. Still, she added that power outages caused the first two Wi-Fi outages and a hardware failure in Littauer caused the third one.
“Since January, there have been two wireless outages, both localized to individual Houses or buildings on campus,” Matheson wrote in an emailed statement. “In both instances, these interruptions in service were due to facilities work.”
Although the first two outages only affected individual Houses and network areas, the third, which occurred over spring break, impacted Wi-Fi connection all over campus for several hours.
“[T]he third over spring break did have a broad impact,” Matheson wrote. “The net result of reviewing wireless outages is a good reminder that the Harvard wireless network is both expansive and complex, as there are a number of underlying elements that make up the service.”
Matheson noted that none of the recent incidents point to a larger problem.
“There was nothing found in the survey of incident reports that would point to a systematic problem, nor are there any structural modifications that have caused a negative impact,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Law School affiliates discovered additional physical evidence of illegal audio recording activity over the weekend and on Monday, heightening activists’ concerns about surveillance of private conversations.
Early last week, activists with the group Reclaim Harvard Law first found a recording device stuck beneath a table in the Caspersen Student Center lounge, which they call “Belinda Hall” and have been occupying since February. Activists said the device had captured conversations in the hall—some of which they considered sensitive—for four days. They disclosed their findings to administrators and the public with a press release last Friday, prompting the Harvard University Police Department to open an investigation at the request of administrators.
Recording conversations without the consent of both parties is a crime in Massachusetts, punishable by up to $10,000 in fines and five years in prison.
The discovery of a second recording device complicated the investigation over the weekend. A student approached administrators Saturday to report that they had discovered the device in a classroom early last week. The student gave the recorder to administrators, who provided it to HUPD, according to an email the Law School’s Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells sent to Law School affiliates Monday evening. Activists said the student who found the second recorder is not affiliated with Reclaim Harvard Law.
Separate inspections of Law School facilities by staff, student activists, and HUPD officers also uncovered strips of velcro used to affix recording devices to furniture in several classrooms and sites in the lounge. Reclaim Harvard Law member Bianca S. Tylek said the classrooms where velcro was found hold classes that have extensively discussed recent activism at the school.
Activists said they have not yet turned the first recording device over to investigating officers because they are working with attorneys to protect the people whose sensitive conversations were captured, Tylek said. She also said activists have only briefly interacted with police officers and felt uncomfortable divulging information with administrators present. She said Sells requested that they hand over the device to HUPD.
Reclaim Harvard Law members publicly aired concerns about what they perceive as collaboration between administrators and HUPD during the investigation in a press release Tuesday.
“We find it hard to trust the Harvard University Police Department charged with the investigation given their close relationship with the administration,” second-year Law student Simratpal Kaur wrote in the statement.
Administrators initially offered to assist in the HUPD sweep of the student lounge on Monday. Law School spokesperson Robb London said administrators who were present only offered to lift furniture and were not sent to intervene in the sweep. Still, Tylek said activists found this behavior inappropriate in a criminal investigation, even one occurring at the school at the request of administrators.
“If it is a criminal investigation, it should be conducted by the police without the input of an interested party,” Tylek said.
London denied any inappropriate partnership with police officers.
“There is no collaboration beyond our passing along information we learn about, or trying to accommodate or facilitate HUPD’s requests to examine publicly accessible locations on our campus or to interview students,” he wrote in an email.
London deferred to HUPD to answer whether officers were sharing their findings with administrators. HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote that HUPD does not comment on ongoing investigations as a matter of policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students have constructed an expansive art installation featuring transparent columns in all 12 of Harvard’s upperclassman Houses—along with Dudley House and Boylston Hall—to call further attention to ongoing discussions about sexual assault on campus.
House residents on Tuesday found triangular plexiglass columns, which are covered in cutouts of letters and statistics from the University's sexual assault conduct survey. A sign next to the installation encouraged people to use provided markers to write their thoughts and feelings about Harvard’s sexual assault climate directly onto the plexiglass.
The project, entitled “Where Do We Go From Here?”, came about in response to the findings of last September’s “troubling” sexual assault climate survey, according to Devon M. Guinn ’17 and Delfina S. Martinez-Pandian ’17, the artists who led construction of the piece.
“The very distressing results of the report signaled to many of us, including me, that the current situation was not a safe one for all students,” Martinez-Pandian said. “We were thinking about where we were, and what this report reflected about the current situation of the sexual climate in our campus.”
The project came together at a meeting for student leaders in the arts hosted by Jack Megan, Director of the Office for the Arts, following the release of the survey in September.
“When the report on sexual assault was released last fall, I was like everybody else. I was exceedingly upset by it,” Megan said. “I wanted to ask our arts community: is there a role for the arts to play in responding to this?”
Over weeks and months of discussion, the concept and design for the project emerged. Martinez-Pandian and Guinn had the help of local artist Ross M. Miller ’77 for the logistical work of creating and designing the physical structures. The students involved also met with administrators to ensure that the project was engaging the issue in a productive way.
“We think that this is a very important issue and it needs to be talked about and discussed, but also we knew that because it’s such a sensitive issue, we knew we had to be very thoughtful in our approach,” Guinn said.
To that end, Guinn, Martinez-Pandian, and Megan met with representatives of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Title IX Office, and the Harvard College Women’s Center.
After two weeks in the Houses, the 14 columns will be brought together for public viewing in Harvard Yard’s Tercentenary Theatre at the ArtsFirst festival. In the meantime, Martinez-Pandian says she hopes that people who view the installations will think deeply about the issues they discuss.
“The most important part of the structure is the reflective panels, the reflective surfaces on the sides of each column,” Martinez-Pandian said. “People look at the report, the excerpts, these panels of statistics, but then when they turn on to the other part of the triangular columns, they see themselves. By being reflective, we see the statistics reflected on us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fulfilling a longtime wish for student activists, a committee composed solely of undergraduates has begun meeting to provide “unfettered” input for administrators as the College seeks to implement sexual assault prevention measures.
The committee is one of two separate working groups that have begun meeting to implement recommendations from a University-wide task force’s report on sexual assault prevention and is advised by Emily J. Miller, the College’s Title IX Coordinator, and Emelyn A. dela Peña, the assistant dean for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.
On March 9, a University-wide task force released recommendations for preventing sexual assault at Harvard, a problem President Drew G. Faust has deemed “deeply troubling.” The 20 page report covers all of Harvard’s schools, but disproportionately focuses on the College, citing its “residential character” and historically single-sex social organizations as potential problems in addressing sexual assault prevention.
Before the report was even released, a group of roughly a dozen students convened this semester to help craft the College’s response to the prevalence of sexual assault, according to dela Peña.
Before the start of the 2016-2017 academic year, both the student working group and a separate faculty committee will submit a plan of action to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana addressing how the report’s broader recommendations will be implemented at the College level.
Some students have long desired the creation of an all-student task force to provide input on sexual assault prevention. In November, anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better sponsored an undergraduate-wide referendum criticizing Harvard’s central administration for a perceived lack of student input in addressing campus sexual assault.
The referendum received widespread support in the election, with 76 percent of voters approving the proposal. Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer of Our Harvard Can Do Better, now serves on the student-comprised working group.
So far, the all-student group has met several times under the guidance of dela Peña and Miller. Dela Peña said the group’s primary focus is to “come up with student-centered, student-focused interventions” both in sexual assault prevention and response.
She added that the group’s purpose is to give “unfettered” input to College administrators on an issue that largely affects students.
The student working group draws membership from the Undergraduate Council, varsity sports teams, and students from the College’s women’s, anti-sexual assault advocacy, and BGLTQ organizations, according to Fournier and dela Peña.
“It’s a very broad representation,” dela Peña said.
The working group is divided into three subcommittees, focusing on addressing prevention of sexual assault, revisiting the College’s response mechanisms for sexual assault, and devising ways for distributing the findings of the committee among the student body, Fournier said.
Despite the new group’s creation and seeming progress, Fournier said she was skeptical about the group’s ability to effect change.
“This group is really focusing on the prevention side of things, and where does that leave us on policy change,” Fournier said. She argued that there should be greater student representation on a separate committee charged with reviewing Harvard’s Title IX policies.

Amid recent and pending retirement of several key sales representatives, Harvard University Press announced that it is signing with Columbia University Press for sales this fall.
Starting this September, HUP will be partnering with its counterpart at Columbia to cover sales in Canada and the United States. This agreement will formalize a preexisting arrangement that provided joint coverage between the two organizations in the Southeastern U.S.
HUP’s current partners of 25 years, MIT Press and Yale University Press, will maintain a three-school consortium by adding the Princeton University Press to their joint sales force.
“We had a little relationship with Columbia because the Harvard, Yale, and MIT deal didn’t include coverage in the Southeast,” Susan M. Donnelly, director of sales and marketing at HUP, said. “HUP worked with Columbia [in that region] for the past three or four years and we liked them.”
Donnelly cited differences in the trajectory of the publications of the three presses as a primary reason that Harvard will no longer be a member of the consortium with Yale and MIT. A primary difference, she noted, is that art is not a large part of HUP’s portfolio but a significant portion of both the Yale and MIT lists.
Jay Cosgrove, sales director of the Yale University Press, also recognized this difference in the composition of the publication lists of the two organizations, noting that more than half of YUP’s books every season are from the art list.
“Secondly, while [HUP] publish[es] books that are used as textbooks in the upper level courses and we publish a lot of books that are used as secondary readings in college courses, we don’t publish books that are set out to be assigned textbooks in college courses,” Donnelly said. “But both Yale and MIT do.”
According to Donnelly, partnering with Columbia was a natural formalization of an ongoing relationship due to the fit of their respective lists and the profile of the sales group.
The president and director of the Columbia University Press, Jennifer Crewe, agreed that the strengths of the HUP and CUP publishing programs complement each other well.
“Our presses have worked together for a long time in an informal way, so this is a really nice way to formalize the very collegial relationship we have,” Crewe said.
Recent and pending retirements of two of the three sales representatives of the consortium with Yale and MIT provided an opportunity for HUP to reconsider its current business model, according to Donnelly.
Another factor was the drastic changes in the publishing and bookselling industries over the past decade, she said.

The quiet church bells in Harvard Yard are not used to competing with internationally renowned electro dance DJs.
But next Sunday, that is just what will happen when artist Steve Aoki, best known for arena-rocking sets and a slew of chart toppers, headlines the College’s annual Yardfest concert.
The announcement, made by the College Events Board on its Facebook page and in a mock psychology survey sent over multiple House email lists, came after delays due to contract negotiations and brings to a halt weeks of speculation.
Yardfest Co-Chair M. Wyatt Robertson ’18 said the results of a preference survey distributed earlier in the year to students overwhelmingly indicated they wanted someone like Aoki.
“One of the main points that stood out on our survey was that students overwhelming wanted a high-energy artist, and that exactly fits Steve Aoki,” Robertson wrote in an email. “Because he's a DJ, he incorporates a wide variety of popular music into his music, so everyone will know at least some songs that he remixes or mashes up.”
Ahead of the CEB’s announcement, many students said they had already heard Steve Aoki’s name being tossed around as a likely headliner.
“It’s weird, because I heard it was going to be him a while ago, then I heard it wasn’t going to be him, and now apparently it is going to be him again,” Ambika Nohria ’19 said.
And while the selection of the popular DJ did not shock those who have been following the rumor mill, students still said they were excited by the choice of performer.
“I think it’ll be fun,” Nohria said of Aoki’s selection, “because his music is nice to listen to even if you’ve never heard it before—you can still enjoy it.”
“I’ve heard he’s an excellent DJ, so I’m really psyched out,” Vishal Jain ’19 added.
The Grammy-nominated artist—known as much for his high-flying antics and crowd-surfing stunts as his hit singles and popular remixes—has released several Billboard-charting studio albums, most notably Wonderland and Neon Future I and II. His remix of Kid Cudi’s song, “Pursuit of Happiness,” also provides the definitive song in popular movie Project X.
Steve Aoki’s performance will follow that of British pop musician Jessie J, who headlined the concert last year, R&B and soul artist Janelle Monáe the year before her, and rapper Tyga in 2013.
The CEB’s selection of Tyga was met with vocal backlash from student groups, who criticized what they said were misogynistic lyrics from the artist and called on the selection committee to reconsider their choice. At the onset of his performance, Tyga used choice language in addressing his “haters.”
Yardfest is scheduled for April 24 this year.

When Paul J. Finnegan ’75, a Harvard Corporation member, stood before a packed Sanders Theatre in September 2013 to announce that Harvard would seek to raise $6.5 billion in its next capital campaign, he drew a standing ovation.
A record-setting effort, the capital campaign set out to fund a number of priorities across the University’s 12 schools, including student financial aid and House renewal. The campaign, entitled “One Harvard,” would be Harvard’s moment to “seize an impatient future,” as University President Drew G. Faust said in her address announcing the drive.
It did not have to wait long.
With a $2.8 billion nucleus already in the bank by the time Harvard publicly launched its fundraising drive, the campaign started strong. Harvard progressed smoothly towards its target goal, receiving a number of landmark gifts as it ticked through major numerical benchmarks—$3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion, and $6 billion.
Now, after blowing through its goal two years before the fundraising drive’s scheduled 2018 end, Harvard will  focus on raising money for individual priorities and programs—including financial aid, House renewal, and the new campus in Allston—that still need the money. The campaign has reached its overall monetary goal well ahead of schedule, and top Harvard administrators, including Faust and Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president development and alumni affairs, have previously said the University will not raise its $6.5 billion goal.
Its goal reached and some of its largest gifts collected, the “One Harvard” campaign will now finish the more humble task of polishing off priorities and engaging rank and file donors.
STRONG OUT OF THE GATE
By the time Harvard publicly launched its campaign, the University had already amassed nearly half its goal in gifts and pledges. This so-called “quiet phase”  is typical in higher education fundraising, according to Donald M. Fellows, president of the fundraising consulting firm Marts & Lundy.
The purpose of  preliminary fundraising, Fellows said, “is to try to bring in some big gifts from those people who are closest to the institution and build this nucleus fund, so that you get to a point where you can make the public announcement. That's typically between 40 and 60 percent of the ultimate public goal.”
“Institutions do that because they want to make sure they're going to be successful and they want to be able to announce that big goal with momentum going into it,” he said.
Harvard also chooses its fundraising goals confident that it can reach them, Paul  J. Zofnass ’69, a major Harvard benefactor, said.
“This happens every time they have a campaign. It’s kind of standard operating procedure: They make sure they do their homework ahead of time and they don’t overestimate,” Zofnass said.
To that effect, Harvard waited to launch its campaign until the impact of the 2008 financial crisis had somewhat dissipated, Faust said in interview earlier this month. That way, the University could more effectively solicit donations from its alumni.
Despite Harvard’s rapid fundraising success, several University administrators have remained reticent to share data about the campaign’s progress. Harvard’s last public update about the campaign came in October, when Rogers said Harvard had raised $6.1 billion towards its goal. Earlier this month, Faust said the University would publish precise data about its campaign progress over the summer.
This reluctance to share updates about the campaign’s progress may stem from a desire to avoid the “politically problematic” optics of enormous institutional wealth, according to Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
Over the summer, when hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson donated a historic $400 million to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—a gift that renamed the school in his honor—a host of vocal commentators derided the gift as gluttonous for the world’s wealthiest university.
“If you’re the people running the capital campaign and you want to minimize the chance that there’s a lot of stories about how Harvard’s raking in tons of cash while there are homeless people in Boston,” then Harvard  would not brag about campaign progress, Hess said. 
THE ROAD AHEAD
Still, with about two years of the campaign’s public phase remaining, Harvard has likely already received many of the fundraising effort’s largest gifts.
“As the campaign advances most of the big money has come in, and this is now getting reunion class and other special interest groups to try and join the bandwagon and be giving,” said Gerald R. Jordan ’61, who has donated tens of millions of dollars to the University.
Three gifts alone—$350 million from Gerald L. Chan, $400 million from John A. Paulson, and $150 million from Kenneth C. Griffin ’89—have funded $900 million of the campaign, or roughly a seventh of Harvard’s goal. Zofnass said the University has likely already targeted many of its largest potential benefactors.
“I would think that they’re probably gone after all of the big hitters and the potential big ones already,” Zofnass said. “Generally the way they’ve done it in the past is they first get the big givers to come up… and then once they get the big gifts they solicit the smaller amounts.”
“I think the likelihood of many more significant additional gifts in terms of dollar value will be relatively slim,” Zofnass said.
Zofnass also emphasized that the size and growth of Harvard’s endowment—which grew to $37.6 billion in the 2015 fiscal year—remains a more useful barometer of Harvard’s financial strength than fundraising totals. John T. Hazel ’51, who has been involved in previous Harvard fundraising drives, agreed, saying that maintaining the strength of the endowment is as important—if not more so—than successful fundraising.
“I think the main thing is that Harvard continue to increase the endowment, invest it wisely and profitably, and have the financial base that we’ve become used to,” Hazel said.
MUST BE THE MONEY
In an interview earlier this month, Faust emphasized that the campaign—while moving rapidly—is not yet over.
“We’re only, in terms of time, slightly more than halfway through the campaign. We have more than two years to go,” Faust said. “So the fact that in some areas we have 50 percent of the money to raise is not surprising. But we do want to make sure we achieve these substantive goals as well as any number that might be an abstraction of what those substantive goals are meant to represent.”
House renewal is one lingering fundraising priority. With the renovations of Winthrop House and Lowell House scheduled for 2016 and 2017, respectively, Faust will continue to fundraise for the project, which could cost as much as $1.3 billion and is allotted $400 million campaign dollars.
Financial aid, another  campaign priority, is also shy of its $600 million goal, despite Griffin’s nine-figure gift. Jordan, who sponsors a number of financial aid scholarships, said that it can be more difficult to excite alumni about priorities like financial aid and House renewal.
“Financial aid and House renewal are not terribly exciting for the donor. Are we going to change the name of Winthrop House? I suspect it could probably become the Winthrop-Jordan house or something, but I suspect it won’t happen,” Jordan said.
Several of Harvard’s 12 schools are still short of their targets, including the Graduate School of Education and the Divinity School, according to Faust. At the Graduate School of Education, she said, the appointment of a new dean in the middle of the campaign complicated fundraising.
“He hadn’t gotten to know any donors, he hadn’t had a chance to acclimate himself to the goals of the campaign, and so he’s been rapidly up to speed and doing fabulously well,” Faust said. “But there’s a ways to go for Education.”
RAISING THE BAR?
Last semester, as Harvard neared the $6.5 billion goal, Faust and Rogers each said the University had no plans to raise its overall goal. Instead, they each said, Harvard will bolster in the remaining projects of the campaign.
But raising a capital campaign target would not be without precedent in the Ivy League. Columbia University increased its goal from $4 billion to $5 billion in its campaign, eventually pulling in $6.1 billion by 2013—an Ivy League record at the time. In New Haven, Yale bumped its target up $500 million after making strong progress in the first two years of its campaign. 
But rather than elevating an already lofty, if tangible, goal, several experts said, Harvard will try to build on its current progress and direct donors towards areas of need.
“Saying we’re going to continue on [the same goal] gives them the halfway point of still continuing to raise money but not necessarily raising the goal,” Winkler said. “That might be a happy medium where they can continue building on the momentum they have so far.”
While the $6.5 billion marks an unprecedented height in higher education fundraising, beating the $6.2 billion record set by Stanford in 2011, several experts cautioned against turning capital campaigns into a horse race.
“For the most part, they’re not out trying to beat one another. This is really about big institutions that have great financial needs and priorities that they need to raise,” Fellows said. “There’s some talk from time to time about an arms race in campaigns, and I don’t think that’s really true. Those top institutions, they're trying to meet these very big strategic goals that require a lot of money to do so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 13, 2016, at 12:21 p.m.
The Porcellian Club, Harvard’s oldest final club, broke its public silence Tuesday for the first time in recent memory to criticize College administrators for their recent efforts to make final clubs go co-ed and modify membership policies.
 In a statement emailed to The Crimson, the graduate board president of the 225-year-old all male club, Charles M. Storey ’82 broadly criticized the College’s management of sexual assault prevention and its actions towards final clubs. While the Porcellian has historically kept a low profile, Storey wrote that present circumstances drove the club to make public statements.
“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time an officer of the PC has granted an on the record statement to a newspaper since our founding in 1791,” Storey wrote in an email. “This reflects both the PC’s abiding interest in privacy and the importance of the situation.” The Crimson published an article in 1984 including brief comments from the undergraduate president.
In a tone modulating between restrained and pointed, Storey’s statement defended the Porcellian’s single-gender character, broadly outlined the club’s financial aid program and diversity of its membership, and called for Harvard affiliates to “come together and ask the College to protect freedom of association at Harvard.”
Storey’s statement comes one day before a planned Wednesday meeting between Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and final clubs’ graduate board leadership, the first since a University-wide report excoriated final clubs for perpetuating “a culture often inimical to Harvard’s mission.”
The language of Storey’s statement was, at times, similarly severe.
“I sincerely hope that the administration will not set the precedent of creating a ‘blacklist’ of organizations that students cannot join,” Storey wrote. “Such McCarthyism is a dangerous road that would be a blow to academic freedom, the spirit of tolerance, and the long tradition of free association on campus.”
Storey also wrote that the Porcellian believes it “is being used as a scapegoat for the sexual assault problem at Harvard despite its policies to help avoid the potential for sexual assault.”
The Porcellian, which claims U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes among its membership, has a long-standing members-only policy that bars guests from entering their Massachusetts Avenue clubhouse. That policy, Storey wrote, “greatly reduce[s] the potential for sexual assault.”
However, citing qualitative and quantitative data, the University’s sexual assault prevention task force sharply criticized male final clubs for a high prevalence of “nonconsensual sexual contact.” Among undergraduate female seniors “participating in the Final Clubs”—including women who attend male final club events and seniors who are members of female final clubs—47 percent reported having experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact,” according to a University-wide sexual climate survey.
While Storey wrote that he “unequivocally” supports the University’s aim of reducing sexual assault on campus, he added that to the best of his knowledge “no allegation of sexual assault has ever been made against the Porcellian Club.” “Sexual misconduct is absolutely unacceptable in all its forms but it is not an issue at the Porcellian Club,” he added.
Overall, Storey argued that the report conflated “the issues of sexual assault, gender equity, and exclusivity.”
Steven E. Hyman, the Chair of the Task Force which produced the report, declined to comment on Storey’s criticism of the report.
“Given our policies, we are mystified as to why the current administration feels that forcing our club to accept female members would reduce the incidence of sexual assault on campus,” Storey wrote. “Forcing single gender organizations to accept members of the opposite sex could potentially increase, not decrease the potential for sexual misconduct.”
Khurana declined to address Storey’s criticisms directly, writing that he would “not comment directly on a statement that I have not seen.” Still, he restated the College’s criticism of single-gender social clubs.
“The College has for many months made it clear that the behaviors and attitudes espoused by unrecognized single gender social organizations at Harvard College remain at odds with the aspirations of the 21st century society to which the College hopes and expects our students will contribute,” Khurana wrote in an emailed statement.
“In addition, as stewards and trustees of Harvard College and role models to our students, the College has a responsibility to protect our values and our students’ well-being, even in the face of perceived short-term challenges of changing the status quo,” he added.
The Porcellian’s statement disagreed and defended single gender organizations. “We believe in the need for, and the value of, single gender institutions for men and women as a supplement and option to coeducational institutions,” Storey wrote.
Storey wrote that the Porcellian has not entirely ruled out a co-ed move, but believes such a choice would fall beyond the purview of College administrators.
“As a club that is completely independent of Harvard, which accepts no funding from Harvard, which owns its own property, and believes fervently in the right to self-determination, that decision is ours, not Harvard’s, to make,” he wrote.
Storey also defended the club’s membership make-up, writing that members are “elected without regard to socioeconomic background, religion, national origin, race or sexual orientation” and that the Porcellian’s membership “reflects the diversity of the male population of Harvard College.”
The Porcellian also offers some form of financial aid—consisting of a dues deferral program—to almost half of its undergraduate members, according to Storey.
The Porcellian’s statement come at a time of intense administrative scrutiny for Harvard’s historically-independent and traditionally all-male final clubs. The all-male A.D. Club recently adopted a no-guest policy similar to the Porcellian’s.
Khurana has adopted a much sharper tone toward the clubs than his predecessors since he began his tenure in the fall of 2014. Last semester, both the Spee Club and the Fox Club added women to their ranks, though the Fox Club’s female members still hold “provisional” membership.
Despite the ramp-up in administrative pressure, Khurana has largely chosen to stay silent on his plans for single-gender social organizations, emphasizing only that “there is nothing off the table.” 
Storey wrote that Khurana has been similarly non-specific in responding to questions from graduate board presidents.
“Since we heard that the University was considering taking some form of action against the independent final clubs… we have reached out to University officials to discuss the matter,” he wrote. “Our efforts have gone unanswered. The Administration has declined to respond to our most basic questions.”
He wrote that the club had questioned whether new rules would be “equally applied” to fraternities, sororities, male final clubs, and female final clubs, and whether new rules would differentiate between organizations that host parties, and those “like the Porcellian Club, the AD, and the sororities” which do not.
Storey and other clubs’s graduate leadership will meet with Khurana Wednesday, according to an emailed invitation from Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.

A previous version of this article indicated that The Porcellian Club made its first public statements to a newspaper since its founding. In fact, while these are its most extensive comments in its history, The Crimson briefly quoted members of the PC several decades ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gary F. Locke, former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and former U.S. ambassador to China, reflected on his political experiences and the future of U.S.-China relations at the Institute of Politics on Tuesday.
Despite being appointed to lead the Department of Commerce in the midst of a severe global recession, Locke said he thought under his leadership, the Department was successful in increasing government efficiency. In particular, he said he achieved a significant reduction in grant application processing.
“We streamlined government agencies and instead of keeping a process that takes 20 months, [we] reduce[d] it down to 18 days,” Locke said.
Karen G. Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, praised Locke’s emphasis on metrics. Mills served with Locke in President Barack Obama’s Cabinet as Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Association.
“You always count days; you always set a metric,” she said to Locke. “For instance, when you were Governor, you shortened the number of days it took to get a driver’s license at the DMV. Then you shortened the time it took to get grants from the Commerce Department. And then you went to China and you shortened the time to get a visa.”
Locke said his emphasis on producing measurable results was driven by a desire to make government employees seek risky, innovative solutions to problems, and be proud of their work.
“What I always tried to do was set super-high stretch goals knowing, oftentimes, [government] agencies could not meet them,” he said. “But [we would] celebrate whatever they did, send the message that it was okay to try, even if you fail.”
In his role as ambassador to China—the first Chinese American to hold the position—Locke said he attempted to pursue the same level of efficiency as he did in his role as a member of President Obama’s cabinet. He was able to open up markets for American goods, solidifying the strong economic relationship America shares with China.
“So the reality is that China and US relations are much closer today than they were even 15 years ago, or 10 years ago,” Locke said. “Our [American and Chinese] economies are intertwined, and there’s also a lot of partnership on scientific research, fighting piracy off the coast of Africa, climate change, and clean energy.”
Max Miao ’19, an attendee at the event said, he “agreed with him when he pointed out that there is such a close relationship of trade and commerce between these two countries that other disagreements and conflicting points seem trivial when you consider the strong points of the relationship.”
Another attendee, Jiafeng Chen ’19 found Locke’s success inspiring.
“I especially respect how he is able to uphold the principles that the United States values while maintaining a cordial relationship with the Chinese,” Chen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­As it officially turns the page to the 2016-2017 season, the Harvard men’s basketball team has chosen its two oldest players to lead it. At its end of year banquet Monday, the team announced that rising seniors Siyani Chambers and Corbin Miller would be the captains for upcoming season.
Chambers and Miller figure into a crowded point guard rotation for the Crimson next year. A three-year starter who withdrew from the College in the fall to preserve his eligibility after tearing his ACL in the offseason, Chambers is the presumptive starter for the next season. In the mix with the two is rising sophomore Tommy McCarthy, who started 25 games for the Crimson this season, four-star recruit Bryce Aiken, and returning senior Matthew Fraschilla.
McCarthy’s role in the rotation is one of the most uncertain. He averaged 8.8 points while making 36 percent of his threes his freshman year, while taking over for Chambers at the point of attack. Monday night, he was honored twice: first for his potential by Boston Globe sportswriter Bob Ryan and then, later, with the Henry Zimmerman Free Throw Shooting Accuracy Award. The freshman was the only player on the team to shoot better than 72 percent from the line, connecting on 55 of his 66 attempts (an 83.3 percent clip).
Despite his excellent shooting from beyond the arc and the line, inside the arc the freshman shot just 31.5 percent from the floor. His struggles to finish around the rim were starkly juxtaposed against the success of junior forward Zena Edosomwan, one of the co-winners of the Raymond P. Lavietes ’36 Most Valuable Player Award. Edosomwan led the team in both scoring and rebounding, narrowly missing out on a double-double by posting averages of 13.1 points and 9.9 rebounds on the season. He ranked third among regulars by shooting just over 50 percent from the floor as the team’s primary offensive option, taking nearly two more shots per game than any other player.
While many of the night’s biggest awards went to juniors, however, the team celebrated the contributions of its three-person senior class—captain Evan Cummins, Patrick Steeves, and Agunwa Okolie. Okolie, who won the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year award, won the Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 Iron Man Award for leading the team in minutes, averaging over 31 minutes a game.
Okolie also split the Most Valuable Player award with Edosomwan after raising his level of play during the conference season. In 14 conference games, the senior reached double-digits 11 times—setting a career high with 29 points in the conference opener against Dartmouth—and leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists while guarding the opposing team’s best player on the defensive end.
Cummins, the team’s sole captain after Chambers withdrew, was honored with the Floyd S. Wilson Sportsmanship Award. He appeared in all 30 games while leading the team by shooting over 61 percent from the field. While he averaged just 6.2 points a game, he led the team in blocks by swatting 1.5 shots a game. His 75 career blocks put him 10th in program history.
Steeves, who had not previously played a minute of college basketball before the season started, won the Hamilton Fish ’10 award as the team’s most improved player. After multiple surgeries left him on the bench during the entirety of three consecutive runs to the league title, Steeves led the Ivy League by shooting 45.8 percent from deep and finished fourth on the Crimson by averaging 9.1 points per game. His 2.4 assists a contest also ranked second on the team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­A furious comeback attempt by the Harvard baseball team came up short on Tuesday afternoon, as the Crimson (9-18, 2-6 Ivy) fell to Boston College, 11-9, on a day in which fielders struggled to corral ground balls and pitchers struggled to get outs. All told, Harvard and BC (17-11, 5-8 ACC) combined for 20 runs on 27 hits and seven errors in a strange, darkness-shortened midweek game at a rain-soaked O’Donnell Field.
“Even though we lost, it was nice to see the comeback we put together after getting down real early,” Crimson co-captain DJ Link said. “Just getting hits at the right time and producing runs, it would have been really easy to give up after being down 10 runs, but our guys did a good job of fighting.”
The Eagles jumped out to a 10-run lead before the Crimson recorded its ninth out. After scoring one run in the first inning and three in the second off of Harvard starter Simon Rosenblum-Larsen and junior Kevin Rex, BC appeared to break the game open in the top of the third. The Eagles branded Rex and sophomore Garrett Rupp for six runs on six hits, with a wild pitch and a throwing error sprinkled in between.
However, the Crimson answered with a crooked number of its own in the bottom of the frame. Freshman Patrick Robinson and reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Week Ben Skinner both reached base to end the afternoon for BC starter Dan Metzdorf. The meat of the Harvard order had an easier time getting on base against Eagles’ freshman Sean Hughes, as the righty recorded just one out while allowing three runs. Link and freshman shortstop Edwin Owolo both doubled and combined to drive in three of the Crimson’s five runs to help cut the BC lead in half heading into the game’s second third.
“It starts with just getting a guy on,” Link said. “We got guys on base, and we drove them in. It’s just one step at a time, getting him on base, [and] moving him over. We got a couple hits together, and before you know it, it’s a couple runs.”
Harvard coach Bill Decker went with a different lineup on Tuesday following two extra inning games this past weekend. The Crimson’s usual left side of the infield—sophomore third baseman John Fallon and junior shortstop Drew Reid—was given the day off while freshman Jake Allen got the start behind the plate. The modified lineup continued the momentum from the weekend, during which Harvard scored 22 runs.
“It’s a great opportunity to get kids into the lineup who really haven’t started much,” co-captain Matt Sanders said. “I think we’ve got a couple young guys who got good experience that will be helpful down the line.”
The Eagles got one back in the fourth, as sophomore designated hitter Scott Braren singled off Rupp before scoring on a Joey Sliepka wild pitch. Harvard responded with two in the bottom half when Skinner was driven in by Mitch Klug, who proceeded to score on a Matt Rothenberg groundout.
The Crimson bullpen was lights-out for the rest of the afternoon, but the offense was unable to get the four more runs it needed to equalize. Despite the wild pitch, Sliepka finished the afternoon with three strikeouts and surrendered just two hits in three solid innings of work. Sophomore Noah Zavolas struck out two in one and a third innings while classmate Dylan Combs finished the eighth without allowing a hit.
“One thing we struggled with early in the year was tightening up our bullpen,” Sanders said. “With last weekend and today, it showed that our bullpen can really pitch well. That gives us confidence, especially with Yale coming up.”
Before the game was called to darkness after the eighth inning, Harvard picked up single runs in its halves of the seventh and eighth. The Crimson manufactured the first of the two runs on three singles, with the first by junior first baseman Matt Hink, who was playing in his second game of the season following a hand injury he suffered during the offseason. The Ballwin, Mo. native singled home Robinson an inning later for his first run batted in of the season.
“It just adds to our depth as a team,” Link said. “He’s a power threat and it’s nice to have him back. He’s going to put his best effort in, and he’s a huge offensive threat...and defensive threat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the dawning of April have come the way-too-early projections for the 2017 college basketball season. Kicking off the empirically foolish prognostications is Joe Lunardi, who selected Princeton as the Ivy League’s representative to the 2016-2017 NCAA Tournament. Lunardi has Princeton, a 12 seed in the South regional, playing Iowa State in the first round.
The Tigers are the obvious frontrunner for the Ivy League title last year, returning every single player who got meaningful minutes this year and adding Hans Brase, a Class of 2016 forward who withdrew from school to preserve his eligibility after tearing an ACL in November. In his last full year for the Tigers, Brase ranked second on the team in scoring (11.5 points a game) and led Princeton with 7.5 rebounds a contest.
At 6’8”, Brase gives the Tigers a post presence they lacked in his absence; 6’10” junior Pete Miller, the team’s nominal center, averaged just six points a game this year and had just five points and four rebounds in the team’s 73-71 loss to Harvard that eliminated the Tigers from Ivy League contention. Behind Brase, the team is stocked with wings that can score and shoot. Juniors Henry Caruso, Steven Cook, and Spencer Weisz all averaged double digits while shooting better than 35 percent from three and 70 percent from the line. Freshman point guard Devin Cannady was a sparkplug in limited action, scoring nearly 12 points a game in 22 minutes and making 46 percent of his threes and 90 percent of his free throws.
Behind Princeton, the league is unsettled. Harvard brings in one of the nation’s top recruiting classes and All-Ivy point guard Siyani Chambers to flank junior Zena Edosomwan, but there are a lot of new pieces for Tommy Amaker to integrate in the offseason. The Crimson is undoubtedly as talented, if not more, than Princeton, but it will have to make up for its lack of continuity. While Princeton’s starters have been playing together for three years, the hypothetical Harvard starting lineup—Chambers, Edosomwan, freshman Corey Johnson, and sophomores Chris Egi and Andre Chatfield—has never played a single minute together.
The Crimson and Tigers remain the surest bets in a league of uncertainty. With the departure of Kyle Smith and the graduation of Maodo Lo, Alex Rosenberg, Grant Mullins, and Isaac Cohen, Columbia loses the head of its program and nearly all of its productivity. Cornell and Dartmouth will likewise try to integrate new coaches, while Penn will build on a promising fifth-place finish in the absence of its dependable senior big man Darien Nelson-Henry. With the last two Ivy League Rookies of the Year, the Big Green’s situation closely resembles Brown’s, who hopes to ride up the standings behind its young guns (Miles Wright and Evan Boudreaux for Dartmouth, Tavon Blackmon and Obi Okolie for Brown).
The league’s biggest puzzle, however, is two-time defending champion Yale. The Bulldogs will likely get sophomore standout Makai Mason back—his declaration for the NBA draft appears to be more of a promotion than anything—but lose two-time Ivy League Player of the Year Justin Sherrod and fellow starters Nick Victor and Brandon Sherrod. Freshman Blake Reynolds and junior Sam Downey had some nice moments in the tournament, but have never seriously received playing time. With Mason and junior Anthony Dallier, the team will have some good building blocks to rely on, but if the team makes a run, it will likely hinge on Mason averaging north of 25 points a game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard assistant coach Yann Hufnagel, who was fired from the same position at California in March after a university report that he had sexually harassed a reporter, was hired Friday by the University of Nevada for the same role.
Hufnagel, who vehemently denied the allegations against him at Cal, had appealed to the university—turning over a lot of personal information to school investigators in late March an effort to clear his name. However, the former Harvard assistant coach dropped the suit late Thursday before the Nevada athletic department made the announcement the next day.
“The toxic environment at UC Berkeley has made it impossible for Mr. Hufnagel to rejoin the basketball team he loves, even if he is vindicated in full, as the facts show,” Mary McNamara, Hufnagel’s attorney, told The San Francisco Chronicle. “He needs to look out for the student-athletes he coached, as well as his own future. Earlier this morning and after much consideration, he decided it was time to move on.”
Hufnagel, whose public statements sine the allegations were released in mid-March were sparse and largely proclamations of innocence, Tweeted Thursday morning for only the second time in three weeks to announce the move.
“I’m back doing what I love … coaching basketball!”

Too many surveys.
We here at Flyby are pretty sure that’s the thought that’s been going through your brain the last week as all of your classmates, spurned forth by the prospect of an end-of-the-semester assignment, have tried all manner of creatively annoying ways to get you to take their social psych surveys. So when the College Events Board posted “Take my psych survey” on the Yardfest events page, we lost it: “What freshman got a hold of the FB event and thought it would be a good idea to pub out their homework?”
But, you know, being the endlessly curious people that we are (aka being the typical bored college students dodging psets), we clicked on the link. What was the worst that could happen?
This is the only time we’ll suggest it: Click the link. It finally happened. Steve Aoki is confirmed for Yardfest 2016. If you’re a fan of electronic music, jumping up and down furiously and having food smashed in your face, then be prepared to have every orifice on your body filled with cake at this year’s Yardfest. If not, well we don’t know what to tell you. We hear Apple Music is great this time of year.
And here we were freaking out, thinking that our Yardfest artist had bailed on us and that we would have to turn up to the nearest Spotify playlist while some of our peer institutions vibed to Chance the Rapper and Fetty Wap. Not to mention that the good ‘ole CEB has graciously allowed Harvard students to bring guests for the first time in Yardfest history. Tickets are $20, and only a limited number of them are available. If you want your bae from Boston to get turnt with you this Yardfest, you better hurry, or else you’ll be left with no choice but to skip on over to the nearest karaoke bar for a date and hope that they don’t dump you.
