After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Oct. 23, Harvard Book Store hosted Jami Attenberg in conversation with Harvard fiction lecturer Laura van den Berg for the launch of “All This Could Be Yours.” Attenberg’s new book, a self-proclaimed “love letter to the city of New Orleans,” was released the day before the launch. Several audience members attending the launch event, however, had already read the book.
Attenberg and van den Berg bustled in to an eruption of applause. As they arrived, every seat was full except for their own.
“This is the first event for [Attenberg’s] tour, which is always really exciting because it brings a lot of people out," said Meghan Bedsted, a Harvard Book Store employee. Usually, the author is able to bring family and friends and there is a lot more energy in the room for a launch event as opposed to an event for a book that perhaps has been out for a couple weeks. This one was really great.” In fact, five family members and her publicist were in attendance.
More than discussions of the book itself, however, many audience members appreciated Attenberg’s thorough discussion of the writing process.
“I always love hearing writers talk about craft. For me it feels like a free education,” said Ruth E. Madievsky, a Boston-based author in attendance.
In response to a question from a young child in the front row, Attenberg explained the daily methodology behind her 1,000 words a day.
“I liked hearing about her routine of walking for an hour in the morning, then reading for an hour,” said Julia G. Cohn ‘15. “The amount of time writers spend reading is something we don't always think about, because I'm just writing when so many of them spend so much time reading. And what they read is also really interesting.”
Though many were fans of her fiction, some audience members were drawn to the event by Attenberg’s Twitter presence. While Attenberg does occasionally tweet promotional images, she also shares tweets like: “I can’t tell you how much I love being corrected by strangers on the internet.” She has 27,700 followers on Twitter.
“I actually have not [read any of Attenberg’s books], but I follow her on Twitter, and I really love her Twitter persona and I love her nonfiction writing. So when I saw this as an option to work, I was excited to scoop it up. But I definitely plan on buying her novel because it sounds great,” said Bedsted.
“I follow Jamie on Twitter and find her hilarious and I love her dog,” said Madievsky.
Half-way through the event, a man repeatedly peeped in through a window, and then walked Attenberg’s dog into the room. He was supposed to bring the dog in as a surprise during the book signing.
After Attenberg vocalized her love for her dog, she shifted into a discussion on the likability of her own characters, whom she writes honestly, yet does not love unconditionally. Victor, for instance, is a character she dislikes so much that she put him in a coma for the vast majority of her new book.
“She takes the reader on a journey where you start to sympathize with someone that you don't think you can relate to,” said Lisa M. Robert, an audience member. “I don't read a lot of fiction. I love nonfiction but when I read her books, I think, ‘Oh, this is what good fiction does.‘“

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to pin down the best way to describe “White Snake”: a modern take on a Chinese legend or a Chinese “Frozen”? “White Snake,” a Chinese animated film directed by Amp Wong and Zhao Ji, keeps audiences wondering where they’re headed next, not because it has carefully woven twists and turns, but because it’s hard to discern what the film is trying to achieve, as limited character motivations and worldbuilding fail to give any hints.
“White Snake” presents a twist on the Chinese Legend of the White Snake, in which humans are at war against all demons, particularly snake demons. Blanca (Zhang Zhe), a white snake demon, relives the suppressed memories of star-crossed love and war buried in her green hairpin. Animated feature films are often meant for a younger audience, and Western audiences in particular associate animated films with Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar. When done right, these stories have enough heart and complexity to appeal to all ages, but “White Snake” doesn’t quite tap into that sweet spot. The plot is rather simple, with a story that revolves around two camps in conflict with a forbidden romance at the center and a talking animal sidekick to top it all off. Yet, given the film’s several sensual scenes and the way every female character’s skirt seems to unnecessarily reveal a tad too much skin, it’s also clearly not meant for children.
Another pressing issue with “White Snake” is its lack of worldbuilding. The movie presents just enough about the fantasy world for the story to make sense, and it often doesn’t define critical concepts or rules so plot twists feel unfounded. For instance, characters say the human world has been overrun with demons, but besides the colony of snake demons hiding underground, the movie hardly shows any other demons. It’s clear that the General, the film’s primary antagonist on the human end, is obsessed with capturing snakes for his power, but it’s unclear why snakes are so special and how humans got the upper hand in this fight in the first place. Blanca is initially sent on a mission to kill the General, but the movie doesn’t explain why she’s chosen, how powerful she is relative to anyone else, or what her relation to the rest of the snake colony is like. For most of the film, there’s no indication that there are any more than two cities in the world, and there’s no sense of geography. Even in the climactic battle, it’s unclear how either side’s powers actually work. It’s always tricky to find a balance between building a robust fantasy setting and overloading on exposition, but while the world of “White Snake” shows potential, it’s not nearly developed enough to withstand scrutiny.
What’s even worse is that the characters are underdeveloped as well, so their motivations are constantly unclear. Basically every female character in the movie besides an elderly grandmother is sexualized for no apparent reason and with no contribution to their development. The male protagonist Ah Xuan (Yang Tianxiang), despite easily being the character with the least magical capabilities in a world full of powerful demons and magicians, consistently defeats enemies of all sorts and protects Blanca, one of the most powerful snake demons. Their romance develops in about two days, and it’s rather difficult to understand why Xuan is willing to give up everything for Blanca after knowing her for so short a time. Even the character with the most potential for complexity, Blanca’s best friend Verta (Tang Xiaoxi), falls short. Verta risks her life without hesitation to find Blanca when she disappears, and a combination of her apparent longing for Blanca in several intimate moments hint at the possibility that Verta’s love for Blanca is more than sisterly. Yet, Blanca never acknowledges the possibility that Verta may have feelings for her, and the film doesn’t take advantage of this possibility that could’ve given the characters and the plot a fresh tension.
Altogether, “White Snake” could be an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half if you’re willing to turn your brain off, and it’s an accessible departure from this world for those who have never tried out Chinese fantasy. Ultimately, though, there’s just not enough substance to sink your teeth into.

In the latest reshuffling of Harvard Square, the famed Out of Town News stand has shuttered, leaving the famed kiosk it occupied in the middle of Harvard Square. The 64-year-old newsstand’s departure represents an unfortunate but very real trend of declining sales of print journalism in a digital age, as well as a wider issue of longevity and new construction within the Square; its fate was therefore often uncertain for many years past.
We’ve spoken repeatedly, alongside many other voices, about what the fate of Harvard Square will be, and what it will look like as it continues to pass into future years and serve future generations of Cantabrigians and Harvard affiliates, especially as changing tastes determine what lives or dies in the few little blocks surrounding the neighborhood. We’ve urged students to support the kind of Harvard Square they want to live in, encouraged the Cambridge City Council to spark greater debates about affordability within the city, and hoped that landlords and business owners can work to foster meaningful ties to the area.
But something often lingering in the background, and not often explicitly touched upon, is the difficulty of building and fostering community in Harvard Square. Can a real sense of belonging truly be found in an area so often defined by the transience of many of its visitors, students and tourists alike?
One answer to that question has been proposed by CultureHouse, a community-based non-profit organization which hosts social events and artistic performances, which is stepping into the void Out of Town News has left in the Harvard Square Kiosk until April. They hope to transform the kiosk’s 500 square feet into a space “to work, to play, and to interact to get to know your neighbors,” per the organization’s founder. We are interested to see what CultureHouse can accomplish with the place in its short stint within Harvard Square, but have also reflected on similar places within the Square with similar goals, if not exactly striving for the same sort of environment.
We feel that the Smith Campus Center, for instance, has provided a valuable communal space for Harvard affiliates in the year after its major renovation. It has been a positive contribution for all those visiting the are,, and has done an exemplary job serving as Harvard’s “front door.” We’re pleased to have it around, and heartened by the ways in which it has brought many of us together. We would also recognize and encourage others to consider the Democracy Center on Mt. Auburn Street, a self-described “vibrant” and “alternative” activist community space, which we feel is underutilized and has enormous potential for fostering an important and unique space for those searching for one.
As CultureHouse, then, prepares to move into Harvard Square, we hope that its organizers use the unique kiosk environment to add value to the lives of those who interact with it. We also hope that community members were involved with, or will be involved with, how CultureHouse moves into and uses the space, and hope that similar future projects also involve enormous community input. And moving forward, we’d like to see more discussion surrounding how current spaces in Harvard Square can be bastions of community, beyond their sole economic potential or contribution.

Yesterday, we released the results of an unprecedented survey designed to indicate how we might create a culture of inclusive excellence at Harvard University. By deciding to regularly check our community’s institutional “pulse,” we are now positioned to better manage our community’s institutional health.
The launch last spring of the Pilot Pulse Survey on Inclusion and Belonging is the most recent in a series of other similarly foundational decisions made by and about Harvard in the last half century toward creating a more welcoming Harvard.
In April 1968, in the wake of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Harvard and other elite institutions decided to launch the diversity surge with record-breaking enrollments of minorities, beginning in September 1969. Fifty years after that decision, University Presidents Drew G. Faust and Lawrence S. Bacow decided to supplement previous diversity efforts by establishing and funding a new Office for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging. And a few weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs decided in favor of Harvard’s “whole-person” admissions process, thereby upholding the existing laws that regard diversity in education as a worthy, beneficial pursuit.
But diversifying our community is not enough, on its own. That is why three years ago, the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging was appointed. There was a need to understand whether, why, and how those from what they called “groups previously excluded” (including women, people of color, religious minorities, individuals with disabilities, members of the BGLTQ community, and others) were less able to flourish here at Harvard. The Task Force also wondered what institutional changes might help position everyone to thrive.
One way to set the stage for everyone to thrive is for leadership to listen, very carefully. This is why we developed and pursued the Pilot Pulse Survey, marking the first time that Harvard leaders asked everyone in our community to share perceptions about the campus culture.
What did you tell us? Most of you (77 percent) expressed some form of agreement with the statement, “I feel like I belong at Harvard.” We are encouraged by this number, but, importantly, we are focused on the 23 percent of you who did not agree, and the 25 percent of you who only “somewhat agreed.” It is also telling that, according to the data, those from groups previously excluded were often more likely to answer in ways that do not indicate a favorable sense of belonging at Harvard. This reflects a reality for far too many in our community that isn’t acceptable, and we are committed to doing what we can to change Harvard’s culture to ensure this is not the case.
Addressing this will take creativity and innovation from all of us across campus. Schools and units across Harvard have developed strategic plans for strengthening diversity, inclusion, and belonging. We also launched the Harvard Culture Lab Innovation Fund, which will provide an opportunity for all members of the Harvard community to apply for competitive grants to pursue projects that will advance sustainable inclusive excellence — which is our aspiration, inclusivity that is ingrained in all that we do. And we’ve formed Harvard’s first ever Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Leadership Council, with representatives from all of Harvard’s school and units, to generate actions in response to the survey, coordinate and support efforts across campus, and share promising practices.
Most importantly, we will continue to value your perspectives. Even as we deepen our understanding of these initial survey findings, we have already committed to conducting the first official version of the Pulse Survey, with additional and refined demographic questions, in 2021 and every other year thereafter. On the road ahead, these surveys will help us to regularly assess our University-level progress and improve in areas where we have fallen short.
For nearly 90 percent of the lifespan of this institution, the Harvard community reflected privileged sons of New England’s elites. As a result, Harvard was ill-equipped to realize a diversity-driven vision of greatness.
With the very intentional actions that this institution has taken, starting 50 years ago, that has changed. And, it means the true greatness and excellence we now seek is ahead, rather than behind us. As President Bacow has said, “We need diversity because we learn from our differences.” It should encourage and inspire in and well beyond Cambridge that the mix of students on campus today at Harvard resembles the nation and world they will be challenged to lead and shape in the years ahead.  As we now aspire to fully harvest our diversity, this will add true dimension and power to our leadership capacity, institutionally, and to that of our graduates, individually.
John S. Wilson is the Senior Adviser and Strategist to University President Lawrence S. Bacow. He leads the University’s new Office for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems as though we might have found the next man who would be perfect to lead the United States.
He’s a world leader who trips children during a game of soccer in order to get the ball — sounds like the tenacity and dedication we need in this country! The last time he cried was when his beloved bicycle, nicknamed Bikey, was stolen outside Parliament — sounds like the sensitivity we’ve been looking for to deal with tragic natural disasters or gun violence! And he is so impressive that he got trapped in a zip wire while holding two Union Jack flags — sounds like the patriotism we hold near and dear to our hearts in America!
In fact he sounds almost too familiar. It seems as though the United Kingdom has Donald Trump 2.0: New and Improved — also known as United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
There have been countless articles written that compare the two men. They both have absurd-looking hair, they both are known for saying extremist or inflammatory remarks and unintentional “gaffes” that make people cringe, and the list goes on and on. It seems as though these men are trying to become memes half the time. I almost feel bad for Canada being stuck with Justin Trudeau for a second term instead of getting one of these worldly men.
Sounds like we should try to figure out a trade of some sort, right? Evidently these men are fairly interchangeable from the looks of it, so we might as well try to take the one who has some prior political experience. And he was born in New York City? Even better!
Johnson even has the extremist views that have become such an essential part of American politics. Who wouldn’t want a president who compares women wearing garments like niqabs and burqas to “looking like letter boxes”? Or one who refers to Africa as “that country” entering the “global economic system”? Or how about one who reads an inappropriate Rudyard Kipling poem in Myanmar’s most sacred temple? How could we ever doubt the current state of global politics when men like this are running the most powerful countries in the world?
It seems as though we’ve found our perfect replacement president — and maybe some people won’t even notice the difference!
And in some ways, we Americans almost want Johnson to be another Trump. If we are stuck with such a mess of a leader, why should other countries not have to face the same struggle? But despite his comical behavior and controversial opinions, Johnson does not actually have as much in common with Trump as many Americans seem to think.
He is not just a walking meme. More than anything, Johnson is an intelligent man — something that would be difficult, if not impossible, to say about Trump. A bookish child who attended the boarding school Eton on a prestigious merit-based scholarship and then went on to study classics at Oxford University, Johnson is a man who loves Homer and Aristotle, and has written his own book on Winston Churchill.
Furthermore, unlike Trump, who in some ways just fell into the presidency, Johnson has been orchestrating his rise to power for decades. He was a two-term conservative mayor of the liberal city of London, and yet still managed to leave office with an almost 60 percent approval rating. When he was unable to transition from being an unofficial leader of the Brexit “Vote Leave” campaign to becoming prime minister, he didn’t give up. He served within his rival Theresa May’s cabinet, then resigned and continued to undermine her leadership as an outsider in an effort to oust her so that he could finally ascend to prime minister.
Clearly, this is not the same brand of world leader as the one currently occupying the White House. No, Johnson is actually adept at seeming like an unprepared buffoon while accomplishing political goals in a strategic manner.
Sounds like we’ve got this man figured out! He is a funny, intelligent, politically savvy, extremist, messy-haired 55-year-old who makes Islamophobic comments and is running the United Kingdom. Seems pretty straightforward, right?
The problem is that people are constantly underestimating him, especially in America. It seems as though we’ve gotten so used to meme culture where we laugh at our world leaders instead of respecting them, to the point that we almost stop paying attention to their political adeptness.
In such dark times, it makes sense to take a step back and laugh at how absurd things have gotten. It helps give us perspective, it helps us cope, and it helps us stay happy. But especially in cases like that of Johnson, what happens when the laughter means we might forget the problem entirely?

A group of alumni and faculty supporting fossil fuel divestment penned a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee ’72 last week asking for a meeting with members of the Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — to discuss divestment.
“The world is already awash in reserves of fossil fuels, and if we are to have any chance for a sustainable future for life on the planet, it is suicidal to continue to support the exploration for or development of even more fossil fuel reserves,” the letter reads.
Members of the Ad Hoc Committee on Harvard Divestment — which includes former United States Senator Timothy E. Wirth ’61, former Overseer Kathryn “Kat” A. Taylor ’80, and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator and School of Public Health Professor Gina McCarthy — previously met with Bacow and Lee early this year.
The letter recommends that the Corporation instruct the Harvard Management Company — the University’s financial arm — to withdraw any investments in the fossil fuel industry and replace any financial advisers who are unwilling to carry out divestment.
The letter also asks the University to clarify its policies about engagement with fossil fuel companies. Bacow has resisted divestment, arguing that Harvard can help mitigate climate change by working with these companies. In September, HMC joined the Climate Action 100+, a group of investors committed to pushing greenhouse gas emitters to take action on climate change initiatives.
Wirth said Harvard must look past administrators’s past rhetoric to dispute divestment.
“It’s time for the University to pay attention to its responsibilities — those include how its endowment is invested,” Wirth said. “They act as if it’s 20 years ago, and in fact, it is a time of accelerating climate crisis.”
“I’m continually surprised at their recalcitrance and the fact that they fall back on answers that proved inadequate ten years ago,” he added.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that the University has and will continue to maintain communication with the Ad Hoc committee.
“Harvard has received the letter, and is in regular communication with Senator Wirth,” Newton said. “President Bacow and Bill Lee have met with him and many of the signatories of this letter, and we expect to stay in close touch with this group.”
The letter makes a point to reference other institutions of higher education who have chosen to divest from fossil fuels, including the University of California and Smith College.
“Our country and the world are changing rapidly, and it is past time for Harvard to change as well, to move beyond the tired, outdated and ineffectual policy established years ago,” the letter reads.
The letter also mentions Corporation members’ current and previous professional ties to the fossil fuel industry, including Theodore V. Wells, who recused himself from any Corporation deliberations or votes related to fossil fuel divestment in 2015, when he became legal counsel for ExxonMobil in climate change litigation.
The letter closed by addressing methods the group has deployed for creating a “broad coalition of alumni” who support fossil fuel divestment, including hiring professional organizers to help coordinate alumni support.

Rockefeller University named Harvard Chemistry Professor Xiaowei Zhuang as the 2019 recipient of the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize — an international award celebrating women in biomedical science — according to a press release Tuesday.
The university, a graduate biomedical research institute in New York, awarded Zhuang the prize for her work on the development of super-resolution and genome-scale imaging techniques. Through her work, she found new structures in cells, clarified molecular processes, and discovered new types of neurons.
Charles M. Lieber, chair of the Harvard chemistry and chemical biology department, wrote in an email Thursday that Zhuang is “fearless” and someone who he would “bet on” to achieve great things in the future.
“Professor Zhuang is an amazing scientist in terms of creativity, leadership and determination,” Lieber wrote. “She has been a world leader in both areas cited by the award – super-resolution imaging and single cell genomic imaging – both in terms [of] pioneering the new methodologies and using them.”
Zhuang did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Late Rockefeller professor Paul Greengard and his wife, Ursula von Rydingsvard, created the award in 2004. Greengard advocated for gender equality in science and donated the prize money from his 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine to establish an annual award celebrating women in science. The prize is named after his mother.
Past award recipients include Elizabeth H. Blackburn and Carolyn W. Greider, who both went on to win the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine after being jointly awarded the Pearl Meister Greengard Prize in 2008.
Zhuang’s research is currently conducted out of her lab, Zhuang Research Lab, where she works alongside post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. Her current work focuses on expanding imaging methods and applying them to problems of biomedical interest.
Praising her work, Lieber also pointed out her lasting effect on the scientific community.
“I expert [sic] her to be a guiding light to many in science world wide for years to come…her impact is far beyond the Chemistry department and Harvard University,” Lieber wrote. “It is my good fortune/honor to have Professor Zhuang as a colleague and friend, and I believe the university should be thankful to have her as a member of the community.”
The Rockefeller University will present Zhuang with the award during a ceremony on Nov. 19 at the Caspary Auditorium in New York City. She will also receive $100,000 as part of the prize.

The Athletics department has taken several measures this semester to combat challenges that women in athletics face structurally, including conforming to new standards established by the Massachusetts Equal Pay Law.
The department recently underwent a review to ensure that it followed standards established by the law, according to Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise. The law prohibits wage discrimination, preventing employers from paying employees who do comparable work differently based on their gender.
“We're under more stringent guidelines than our other Ivy peers,” Scalise said in an October interview. “We've been working with our folks in Human Resources and the General Counsel's office to make sure that we have a rubric or an algorithm that explains how we're paying people.”
Scalise said Harvard must constantly monitor the pay for coaches and staff in women’s athletics programs, as well as funding for the program itself. He said the review is an “initial step” but that there is always “room for improvement.”
The department not only strives to meet the standards in the Massachusetts Equal Pay Law, but also to meet the department’s “own internal feeling of fairness,” Scalise said.
Softball Coach Jennifer L. Allard said she works directly with the department to ensure there is equity between her program and the men’s equivalent, baseball.
“I may go to my program manager with goals and objectives for the year, and she’s going to the program manager for baseball to make sure that their goals and objectives are kind of their equal,” Allard said.
In deciding how to allocate money to individual team programs, the department analyzes nationwide trends and pays close attention to how other Ivy League administrations are funding their athletics programs, according to Allard.
The department has taken additional measures to ensure that its overall environment is conducive to promoting equality between genders. For example, the department analyzed whether the pictures on the walls of athletic buildings represented women and people of color within athletics appropriately, according to Scalise.
“Walking down this hallway [in Dillon Fieldhouse], do we have men's teams? Do we have women's teams? Do we have people of color? Do we have inclusion represented by what's on our walls?” Scalise said.
The analysis led to the department posting new pictures in the Dillon Fieldhouse and the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, according to Scalise.
Students have also taken it upon themselves to improve the culture in athletics for women. Earlier this year, three seniors co-founded the Women of Harvard Athletics club in response to what they feel is an underrepresentation of women in athletics, both structurally and culturally. The club seeks to raise awareness about issues female athletes face when dealing with conflicting societal perceptions, like those of being “feminine” and “pretty” while also being “strong” and “competitive.”
Former varsity basketball player and freshman proctor Shilpa S. Tummala ’16 said it is difficult to convey the pressures female athletes face in dealing with stereotypes about femininity to non-female athletes.
“It’s hard to have those conversations with people who don’t understand what it means to be a female student athlete on campus. A lot of our frustrations or whatever our thoughts were on this topic were conveyed within the locker room,” she said. “I don’t necessarily think outside of the community of female athletes that there aren’t too many people who are necessarily empathetic or aware of that.”
Scalise, who will retire at the end of this year, said he hopes the department can build structures to combat these cultural challenges. He described a vision he has to implement a system where both male and female teams in the same sport score cumulatively, and that the winner of an intercollegiate competition is determined from that combined score.
But he said this idea needs further work.
“I've sprinkled seeds [for implementing this type of dual competition], I've kind of watered them, I put a little fertilizer on them,” he said. “They're little seedlings, saplings that are up — but they would need a lot of tending down the road.”

Fifty-two percent of respondents to Harvard’s pilot Pulse Survey on Inclusion and Belong said they agree or strongly agree with a statement inquiring whether they feel they belong at Harvard, according to the survey results released Wednesday.
Stemming from a recommendation made by the University-wide Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion in 2018, the pilot launched in the spring and aimed to get a sense of the campus’s “pulse”— which the survey results described as the broad sense of how people who work and learn on campus feel about diversity and inclusion at the University.
Open to faculty, students, and staff, the administrators said the project was the largest optional survey in Harvard’s history with more than 20,000 affiliates — roughly 44 percent — filling out the questionnaire.
The survey comprised nine questions that asked respondents to rate how strongly they agreed or disagreed with statements like, “I feel like I belong at Harvard” and “I receive meaningful recognition for doing good work,” as well as one open-ended question about how to improve campus climate.
In addition to the 52 percent of respondents who said they agree or strongly agree that they belong at Harvard, 25 percent said they “somewhat agree.”
The survey also included a demographics questionnaire that asked respondents to answer questions about their race and ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other categories.
Students dissented most strongly with the statement “I believe Harvard leadership will take appropriate action in response to incidents of harassment and discrimination.” Thirty-four percent of students disagreed with the statement, while 23 percent of staff did not agree.
An Association of American Universities survey, a national sexual misconduct climate survey administrated in April, found similar results: 50 percent of undergraduate women said they think it is very or extremely likely that a campus official would take their report seriously.
In the Pulse Survey, categories with less than 70 percent of respondents saying that they at least “somewhat agree” that they belong at the University include genderqueer and nonbinary respondents, Muslim respondents, Middle Eastern respondents, black or African American respondents, and bisexual respondents.
Among faculty, the statement “My relationships at Harvard are as satisfying as I would want them to be” incurred the highest rate of disagreement at 25 percent.
The final report accompanying the survey results characterized it as a “high-level ‘pulse,’” not a “high-resolution ‘MRI.’”
“It is intended to take the Harvard Community’s ‘pulse’ to complement and help catalyze more specific/localized inclusion and belonging efforts at Schools and Units across campus,” the report reads.
The report also laid out several immediate actions the University plans to take in response to the survey results, including creating a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Leadership Council, building a website specifically for diversity and inclusion, and hiring a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer.
The report states that the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging has tasked an executive search firm to find candidates for the role.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Congressional committee has approved a bill tying federal education funding to students’ freedom of association, threatening Harvard’s ability to enforce its controversial penalties on single-sex social organizations.
House Committee on Education and Labor members voted 28-22 to approve the College Affordability Act — a Democrat-led reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965 — on Thursday. A section of the legislation entitled “Freedom of Association” sets forth a policy mandating “non-retaliation against students of single-sex social organizations,” according to Christina Carr, a spokesperson for Ruben M. Gallego ’02 (D-Ariz.). Should the act find support in Congress at large, it could eventually force the College to choose between significant sums of federal funding and implementing its contentious social group sanctions.
“An institution of higher education that receives funds under this Act shall not … take any adverse action against a student who is a member of a single-sex social organization based solely on the membership practice of such organization limiting membership to only individuals of one sex,” the provision reads.
Harvard’s sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — forbid undergraduate members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from captaining athletic teams, leading student groups, and receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
The section threatening the sanctions is a brief passage in a more than 1,000-page bill that is largely focused on making higher education more affordable through expanded Pell Grant funding, lower interest rates for student loans, and support for tuition-free community colleges, among other initiatives.
At a mark-up session for the legislation Wednesday, United States Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.) — who is a member of the Committee on Education and Labor — lambasted Harvard’s social group policies, calling them “deeply discouraging” and “harmful.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in a statement Wednesday — while the legislation was still being marked up — that the College is implementing “a measured and lawful policy” that is not discriminatory. She declined to comment further Thursday after the committee had approved the Act.
“Harvard College seeks to build a community in which every student can thrive, and it does so on a foundation of shared values, including belonging, inclusion, and non-discrimination,” Dane wrote. “Harvard should not have to change its commitment to non-discrimination and educational philosophy for outside organizations that are not aligned with our long-standing mission.”
Though the College Affordability Act is moving forward through the legislative process, a divided Congress means the bill might have slim chances of becoming law. The Committee voted Thursday along party lines, with 28 Democrats voting in favor of the Act.
The College Affordability Act differs substantially from a recent Republican-driven reauthorization attempt called the PROSPER Act — which was ultimately never put up for a vote in the House despite Republicans’ majority control of both chambers in 2018, according to Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education.
“The Republican 2018 bill would have cut 400 or 500... billion dollars from federal higher-education spending,” Hartle said. “And the Democratic bill, the College Affordability Act would increase it by 400 to 500 billion dollars over the next 10 years.”
Travis J. Bristol, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a Tuesday interview that he does not expect bills focusing on social programs to pass through Congress at this point in the Trump presidency.
“I think that we’re going to be focusing on impeachment at least until the next election,” Bristol said.
The bipartisan effort to amend the Higher Education Act with specific freedom of association protections follows a years-long lobbying push partially bankrolled by single-sex social clubs at Harvard. The PROSPER Act also included a clause imperiling Harvard’s sanctions that drew ire from former University President Drew G. Faust. Stefanik and Gallego introduced new legislation — the College Freedom of Association Act  — targeting Harvard’s sanctions over the summer.
Lawmakers’ most recent attempt to thwart the sanctions comes amid parallel state and federal lawsuits alleging the policies are discriminatory and infringe on students’ freedom of association. In August, a judge ruled that the federal case will move forward, with the discovery stage — a fact-finding period that could include review of internal administrative documents and lengthy depositions from the Harvard officials responsible for formulating and implementing the sanctions —set to begin soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Ivy League title hopes are on the line this weekend as the undefeated, Ancient Eight leading Dartmouth Green arrives in Cambridge Saturday. With the loss to Princeton last weekend, the Crimson (4-2, 2-1 Ivy) no longer controls its own destiny in the league rankings. To earn a share of the title Harvard needs to win out — and Princeton needs to lose.
“As far as I’m concerned, it’s the biggest game of the year for us,” said senior defensive lineman Brogan McPartland. “This is definitely make it or break it. We’ve got to get this one done.”
Only two undefeated teams are left in Ivy League play, Princeton and the Big Green. If the Crimson wins this weekend, a Dartmouth (6-0, 3-0) victory over Princeton in Yankee Stadium the week after will be enough to put Harvard back in contention for the title.
Beating the Big Green, however, is a tall order. The team has eviscerated its opponents, winning by an average of 31 points across its six games. Penn (2-4, 0-3) gave Dartmouth its most competitive contest this season, losing by only 13 points. Among the Ivy League, the Big Green has downed Yale, Columbia, and Penn.
“I don’t let that get to me really, I just play like it’s any other team,” said junior running back Devin Darrington. “My mentality coming into this game is just to do I what I do: run down hill, don’t think too much, use my speed, get past these guys, and just tote the rock.”
Nationally, Dartmouth ranks 14/15. Last week’s competitor, Princeton, ranked 13/13.
The Big Green currently leads the nation in both offensive production, scoring 41.8 points per game, and defense, as competitors average only 10.8 points against the Big Green Defensive Machine.
“Everybody on our team understands we’re going from the proverbial frying pan to the fire, just the way the schedule the last couple of years was set up,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “This may be the best Dartmouth team I’ve seen definitely in my 26 years. They’re definitely one of the best FCS teams in the country. I don’t think anyone has even given them a game yet.”
At the helm of that offensive production is the dual threat quarterback situation. Dual threat not in the traditional sense where the play caller can both run and throw, but that there are two quarterbacks. Both senior Jared Gerbino and junior Derek Kyler share time behind the center.
The former, Gerbino, is a dual threat quarterback in the tradition sense. In addition to his 694 passing yards, the senior leads the team in rushing yards with 266.
Among rushers, the team is fairly evenly distributed. Five of the team’s rushers have more than 100 yards on the season including Kyler, who has 108. The most effective running back in the bunch is junior Dakari Falconer with 225 yards, but only two touchdowns. His teammate, Caylin Parker has 195 yards and four touchdowns.
“It’s normally a more physical game,” McPartland said. “Against a team that passes a lot, you might leave the game and feel like you’re not even that banged up. But a game like this, it’s going to be a lot of banging each other, a battle at the line of scrimmage, and just who’s stronger, who’s more physical up front.”
For a comparison, Harvard’s top two rushers both have posted better numbers than the Big Green’s leader, Gerbino. Junior Devin Darrington has 548 yards to his name while freshman Aidan Borguet has logged 286. Despite this, Dartmouth has posted 270 more yards than the Crimson on the season.
In passing, Harvard’s Jake Smith has outpaced his division rivals thus far, throwing for 1404 yards while the Big Green’s Gerbino and Kyler have combined for 1200. What they lack in yards, they compensate for in efficiency, each completing over 70 percent of attempted passes.
“They have done such a great job running the football that they’ve thrown the fewest passes of any team in our league,” Murphy said. “But their pass efficiency, because they’re running the ball so well and the play action aspect of it, has made them able to create a lot of really big plays in the passing game. They don’t throw it a lot, but they make up for it.”
Defensively, Dartmouth’s statistics are much more stratified. Leading the team with 44 tackles is senior linebacker Nigel Alexander. The Crimson’s leading tackler, senior linebacker Cameron Kline has 30. However, only five Big Green defensive players have made more than 20 tackles. Harvard boasts eight.
Ironically, while eviscerating opponents, the Dartmouth defense has struggled getting into the backfield, posting only seven sacks on the season. The Crimson’s McPartland has 5.5 by himself, while the team has logged 30, a number that paces the nation.
Harvard also leads the nation in blocks. So far this fall, the special teams unit has managed to touch seven kicks.
Defending against the rush is another category in which the defense from Hanover has struggled relative to the Crimson. The Big Green has ceded 823 yards to opponents this season on the ground. Harvard, despite its two losses, has yielded only 445.
Important to consider as well is the return of Crimson football to Harvard Stadium. After a two-game stint on the road, the Crimson returns to Cambridge where it is undefeated on the season.
“I love playing at home,” McPartland said. “I think we just get very protective at home. When we come in here, we don’t think anyone can beat us here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping its first two sets against a relentless Dartmouth squad, Harvard women’s volleyball fought its way to an extra point showdown in the third set — however, it squandered seven set points and eventually lost the set 32-30 to drop the match, 3-0, last Friday. The heartbreaking loss dropped the Crimson to 2-6 in Ivy League play this season.
In the first set, Harvard built up a 19-14 advantage and looked poised to take a 1-0 lead over its Ivy League rival. However, the Big Green responded with an onslaught of kills and rattled off nine straight points to flip Harvard’s 19-14 lead into a 19-23 deficit. Dartmouth eventually won the set 25-21. The Crimson was unable to recover for the rest of the match, dropping the second set 18-25 and falling just short in the closely contested third. It was the team’s second straight grueling loss against the Big Green: the team previously lost a tough match against its Ivy League rival 3-2 to close out September play.
In spite of the disappointing finish, the match was not without its bright spots. Junior outside hitter Mindie Mabry recorded her second double-double of the season with 14 kills and 15 digs. First-year setter/hitter Ashley Wang recorded a season-high 25 assists to go along with her three service aces. Senior outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank, first-year outside hitter/right-side attacker Katie Vorhies and Wang each tallied five kills to contribute to Harvard’s offense. The team didn’t do quite enough to topple its Ivy League rival, but it hopes to take these positives from its performance and channel them towards a successful finish to the season.
Harvard will not get another opportunity to play Dartmouth this season, but the team gets six more cracks against Ivy League rivals in November. The squad will look to rebound from the tough loss with home tilts against Brown and Yale this weekend. The games will take place in the Malkin Center from November 1-2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team begins its quest to return to the NCAA Tournament tonight with a season- and home-opener against Dartmouth. The No. 19 Crimson (0-0-0) embarks on the 2019-2020 campaign with a talented young core hoping to replace the contributions of six seniors and two pro-ready juniors who departed the program over the summer.
Friday's bout with the Big Green (0-0-0) marks the third consecutive year in which the two Ivy League rivals will duel to start the campaign. The teams have split the past two season-opening decisions, with Dartmouth taking last year's October tilt in a 7-6 overtime barn-burner. Returning an effective top forward trio, the Big Green will once again vie for a statement victory and challenge a Crimson blue line that lost four of its top six skaters from 2018-2019.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opening its season at home, the No. 19 Harvard men’s hockey team faced travel partner and frequent foe Dartmouth. Matchups between the two squads tend to be explosive and high-scoring, much to audiences’ delight and coaches’ chagrin. With the Crimson’s especially young and fast roster this year that run-and-gun tendency seemed even more likely — but though the game was a back-and-forth one, the final score gives it a lopsided look.
Harvard’s (1-0-0, 1-0-0 ECAC) bursts of scoring propelled it past the Big Green (0-1-0, 0-1-0) by a score of 7-3. Those seven tallies included three from freshmen in their first collegiate contests and two from sophomore defenseman Jack Rathbone. Sophomore forward Casey Dornbach, last year’s ECAC Rookie of the Year, pocketed three assists on the night, as did junior centerman Jack Badini.
“Everyone’s excited to finally start to get going here,” sophomore defenseman Jack Rathbone said. “It’s been a while watching some other college teams play the last few weekends, so [it was] good to get out there, good to get the first one under our belt, especially for all the young guys too.”
Though the Crimson jumped out to an early lead, doubling it later in the first period, the bulk of the contest’s action — six goals, in fact — came in the middle frame. Dartmouth came in flying after the first intermission, taking only 1:36 to find the back of the net courtesy of senior forward Daniel Warpecha. The visitors repeated the feat again 20 seconds later and a third time less than five minutes after that, as junior forward Quin Foreman slotted a rebound home after a Big Green 2-on-1. Momentum, arguably, had been on Dartmouth’s side anyway; the Big Green put up 18 shots to Harvard’s 12 in the first period. But now the chances were going in.
“Their first line [of sophomore Drew O’Connor, senior Will Graber, and Foreman] is heavy, and can make it tough on you, and can make it a physical mismatch,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
Whether or not the sequence of events had to do with the Crimson’s inexperience or size — Dartmouth iced one freshman as opposed to the hosts’ four — the test of resilience had arrived early. Now down 3-2, could Harvard withstand a bigger opponent long enough to counter?
It didn’t take long for that question to be answered. Halfway through the game, rookie forward Nick Abruzzese took the puck at the left circle on a pass behind the net and found his classmate, defenseman Henry Thrun, in the slot. Thrun shot the puck off the pipe and in; sophomore goaltender Justin Ferguson was screened effectively on the play. That wasn’t Thrun’s first point of the night, as he had already assisted on Rathbone’s ice-breaking goal in the first period — it was Abruzzese’s first, however.
“It looked like it was a good night to be a freshman,” coach Donato joked. “I thought Thrun was excellent, in the d-zone, offensively, on the power play. I just thought he looked very comfortable for a guy playing his first collegiate game.”
Having tied the game, the Crimson kept going, tacking on a tie-breaking goal less than a minute later. The goal was Rathbone’s second, a top-corner snipe from the right faceoff dot. Still more was to come. 12 minutes into the middle period, a timely Thrun keep-in was carried in behind the goal line by Abruzzese, who then found sophomore forward Jack Drury for a one-timer that beat Ferguson. Drury’s tally was the dagger, though both Abruzzese and rookie John Farinacci added to the goal total in the third period.
Harvard’s offensive performance was backed by steady goal-tending from senior Cameron Gornet (3 GAA, .936 SV%). While Gornet has never started the lion’s share of games in his career, he proved himself in select contests last season. That calm kept out the Big Green in even high-grade scoring chances throughout the game.
“I was happy to see Cam Gornet kind of settle down,” coach Donato said. “I don’t think a couple of the goals early were him at his best. But I was really happy with the way he responded and dug in, I thought he was great in the third period.”
The non-factor that was special teams on Friday was unusual for a contest between these two teams. The Crimson did not manage to score on any of its three man-advantage opportunities, though its 2-0 goal, scored by senior forward Colton Kerfoot, came right after a power play expired. Still, there will be plenty of time to tune up 5-on-4 play as the season goes ahead — and as Thrun (1–1—2), Abruzzese (1–2—3), and Farinacci (1–1—2) demonstrated, it is clear the team can get a great deal of mileage out of its skilled rookie class.
“It was really exciting,” Thrun said. “A lot of good plays were made out there. Thankfully [Abruzzese] had a great pass on my goal. I mean, you can’t do it without a team effort.”
Early chemistry will come in handy next week when Harvard plays host to Princeton and No. 9 Quinnipiac. The Bobcats, not beholden to the late-start rules of the Ivy League, have already put up an impressive non-conference record (4-1-0, 0-0-0 ECAC); while the Tigers are the easier challenge of the weekend, the Crimson would be loath to take any two points for granted.

Between one-ply toilet paper and unscented soap, it’s not easy to find a luxurious public bathroom here on campus. After some investigation, however, it turns out Harvard actually has a few places that make the cut. Behold: the information that everyone needs, but few are brave enough to collect.
Science Center
Location-wise, the Science Center seems like the ideal place for a midday bathroom break — as long as you aren’t going in the basement. Steer clear of these bathrooms. The broken locks, long lines, and wider than average gaps between stalls are everybody’s middle school nightmare.
While the basement might not be the ideal option, venture to the second floor of the Cabot Science Library for a real modern upgrade. Don’t count on being able to go right away, though. With only three single-stall (and gender-neutral!) bathrooms available for use, you’ll get your privacy, but you might have to wait your turn.
Northwest Labs:
These are pretty much the average public restroom. Multiple stalls, gray square tiles, and an occasional shortage of toilet paper give you a pretty unmemorable experience. They’re totally not worth going out of your way for, but if you’re there and you have to go? Hey, why not.
Smith Campus Center: 
The best part about these bathrooms is undeniably the tilework (great for that #bathroomselfie), not to mention the fancy sinks, big mirrors, and toilet seat covers that make for a pretty nice rest stop. The only downside is getting past the “hover your HUID over the keypad to unlock” system that never seems to work when you really need it to.
Robinson: 
It’s a shame that no one knows about these bathrooms (or even where they are), but maybe that’s why they’re the best. The huge mirrors, high ceilings, and the neon yellow stalls make these the actual bathroom jackpot. Someone put a lot of work into designing them, so they’re definitely worth venturing out past Sever to check out.
Lamont:
Although the marble walls might claim otherwise, the bathrooms in Lamont Library aren’t all that special. Among the busiest bathrooms on campus, about half the stalls scream “clean me” on any given Sunday night. Fortunately, they do have toilet-seat covers to address your hygiene woes. Just remember that men's and women’s rooms are on alternate floors.
When you’re running late to class and you really have to go, it’s nice to have so many public spaces to choose from. Some are great and some are just not, but at least they’re all equipped with toilets, paper, and most importantly, soap.
