After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In December 2013, Uruguay legalized marijuana, Earlier, in 2012, Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana under the laws of their states, and 21 additional states and the District of Columbia have now decriminalized or allowed medical use of marijuana.  Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001, and the Netherlands has practiced de facto legalization for marijuana for decades. More broadly, many countries have de-escalated their “Wars on Drugs.” Indeed, President Obama hinted strongly in a recent interview that he supports marijuana legalization.
Legalization advocates, therefore, are feeling optimistic: Many expect full legalization, at least for marijuana, within a few years.
This euphoria is understandable, but premature.
Legalizers are correct that prohibition is a terrible approach to balancing the costs of drug abuse against the costs of policies that attempt to reduce drug abuse.
Prohibition drives drug markets underground, thereby generating violence and corruption. Participants in black markets cannot resolve their disputes with courts and lawyers, so they resort to violence instead.
Prohibition makes quality control difficult, so the incidence of accidental poisonings and overdoses is higher than in a legal market. People who purchase alcohol know what purity they are getting; people who purchase cocaine or heroin do not.
Prohibition spreads HIV. Elevated drug prices incentivize injection (users get a big bang for the buck), while fostering restrictions on clean needles. Users therefore share dirty needles, which accounts for a large fraction of new HIV infections in the United States.
Prohibition harms those who use drugs despite prohibition, since they risk arrest and imprisonment in addition to the negatives of drug use itself.
Prohibition encourages racial profiling and other infringements on civil liberties. Neither party to a drug transaction wants to notify the police, who therefore use more intrusive tactics in the attempt to enforce the law.
Prohibition wastes criminal justice resources and prevents collection of taxes on the production or purchase of drugs, thus adversely impacting government budgets.
And abundant evidence from America’s experiment with Prohibition, from state decriminalizations, and medicaliziations; from comparisons across countries with weak versus strong prohibition regimes; and from experience with other prohibited commodities suggests that prohibitions generates only moderate reductions in drug use. Some of that reduction, moreover, is a cost of prohibition, not a benefit—since many people consume drugs without ill effects on themselves or others.
Prohibition is therefore a terrible policy, even if one endorses government attempts to reduce drug use. Prohibition has large costs with minimal “benefits” at best in terms of lower use.
So legalizers are right on the merits, and recent opinion polls show increasing public supportfor legalization (at least for marijuana). But the negatives of prohibitions have been widely understood at least since the 1933 repeal of alcohol prohibition, yet this has not stopped the U.S. from pushing drug prohibition both at home and abroad.
In addition, further progress toward legalization faces serious impediments.
The first is that recent de-escalation of the Drug War addresses marijuana only. Yet much prohibition-induced harm results from prohibitions of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. Public opinion is less open to legalizing these drugs.
Even worse, drug warriors might respond to marijuana legalization by ramping up hysteria toward still-prohibited drugs, increasing prohibition-induced ills in those markets. The public would then observe increased drug-market violence in the wake of marijuana legalization, which would appear to show that legalization causes violence.
A different worry is that while public opinion currently swings toward legalizations, public opinion can change. And marijuana remains illegal under federal law, so a new president could undo President Obama’s “hands off” approach.
Perhaps the greatest threat to legalization is that many people—including some legalizers—believe policy can eliminate the black market and its negatives while maintaining strict control over legalized drugs. That is why recent legalizations include restrictions on production and purchase amounts, retail locations, exports, sales to tourists, high taxes, and more.
If these restrictions are so weak that they rarely constrain the legal market, they do little harm. But if these restrictions are serious, they re-create black markets.
Legalizers must accept that, under legalization, drug use will be more open and some people will misuse. The incidence of use and abuse might be no higher than now; indeed, outcomes like accidental overdoses should decline. But legalizers should not oversell, since that risks a backlash when negative outcomes occur.
None of this is meant to deny that recent policy changes constitute real progress. But these gains will evaporate unless the case for legalization includes all drugs and is up front about the negatives as well as the positives.

Wintersession—the 10 days of activities at the end of winter break—is a relatively new invention, dating back just a few years. Born out of the calendar change that moved fall semester finals to before winter break, Wintersession serves as the most open and accessible part of Harvard’s January term, or “J-term,” wedged between its two semesters. According to its website, Wintersession allows students “to explore a creative passion, to learn new ideas, to develop a new skill, or to delve into an extracurricular or career interest.” We applaud the work that the College has done in fostering a relaxed and welcoming environment for returning students to ease into the spring semester, but moving forward, we hope to see Wintersession become a more structured and formalized part of J-term.
Within just a few years, the frosty experiment has blossomed into a busy week filled by 140 programs, partly funded by over $20,000 in grants doled out from the UC. While this represents an impressive joint initiative on behalf of students and the College, there remains much room for improvement in years to come, beyond adding additional programs and funding. As more J-terms pass and as Wintersession becomes a more fully integrated part of the Harvard calendar, we would like to see a movement toward the more structured programming offered by January sessions like MIT’s Independent Activities Period. That programming includes a broad, diverse mix of for-credit and not-for-credit courses and lectures, a well-constructed example Harvard could learn from.
Of course, while we hope to see Wintersession grow and become a more integral part of J-term, we respect that the College has not made Wintersession mandatory. Students should spend their J-terms in the ways most productive to them—whether that is participating in formal programming on campus, traveling, or loafing in front of the television screen. Wintersession should continue to be an alternative rather than a mandate. It should be geared toward advancing Harvard’s liberal arts education, an integral component of which is the freedom given to students to chart their own academic paths.
To serve as an effective tool, however, Wintersession needs to have the institutional support necessary to ensure that it continues to grow. This means structural changes plus a commitment to funding—through an increased UC budget or direct grants—on behalf of the College administration so that students can use Wintersession as another tool for pursuing their academic interests. Improving Wintersession, like efforts to expand Harvard’s summer study abroad programs, represents a commitment to yearlong learning, one which we hope to see continue as Wintersession evolves over time.
Wintersession allows students to spend the last week of winter break pursuing their own interests and focusing on whatever they want to do, on or off campus. That is something we are delighted to see more of at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until meeting Allen Counter, my impression of diversity at Harvard was shaped by the comment of a Crimson editor on my press release announcing the launch of the Irish Cultural Society.
“What are you going to do?” he said, scanning the document. “Sit around and drink?”
It was the fall of 1985. Anti-apartheid protests on campus stirred debate. In the swirl of events, ethnic identity fed not divisions but common ground—showing the possibility of many coming together around a single cause.
As the son of an Irish immigrant mother, I appreciated Harvard’s decision to take a chance on me. Its generous financial aid made my education possible. But accepting someone into the club isn’t the same as embracing the new member. Elite institutions have a way of making it clear you must bend your cultural ethos to meet their norms.
The derision I encountered at the Crimson seemed to embody this uncomfortable truth, but only momentarily. By a stroke of good fortune, I wound up the next day in the office of Dr. S. Allen Counter, head of the recently formed Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations.
Counter, a neuroscientist who grew up in the segregated South and survived brutal racist incidents as a child, at that time ran the foundation from the basement of University Hall. The small office nourished a simple idea: that every student, and his or her culture, was welcome not only to attend Harvard but also to contribute to the community. It was an ideal embraced by the president and deans of Harvard when they established the Harvard Foundation to “improve relations among racial and ethnic groups within the University and to enhance the quality of our common life.” And it is an ideal embodied by Allen Counter, whom University President Derek C. Bok appointed as the Foundation’s Director in 1981.
By that stage of his career, Counter had already conducted pioneering excursions into the rainforests of South America to seek out tribes descended from escaped African slaves. While providing support to the fledgling Irish Cultural Society, he was laying the groundwork for a journey to Greenland to follow up on reports of the abandoned sons of Arctic explorers Robert E. Peary and Matthew A. Henson living in remote Inuit communities.
Counter has won public acclaim for his expeditions as well as his work to bring inspiring speakers to Harvard, such as Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager shot by Taliban insurgents for having the audacity to suggest that girls should have a right to education.
But amidst all the medals and citations, Dr. Counter’s enduring legacy will be the students touched by his kindness and those he urged to believe in themselves and value their heritage. With his guidance and support, the Irish Cultural Society flourished, hosting discussions and presenting plays, poetry readings, evenings of Celtic music, and Irish step dancing. Two of the speakers Dr. Counter helped bring to the club, John Hume and Seamus J. Heaney, later went on to win Nobel Prizes.
One of the students I met through the foundation was Rosie G. Rios ’87, a first-generation Mexican-American raised by a single mom in a household of nine children. As a freshman in 1983, she found a safe harbor for the Latina dance group Balleto Folklorico under Counter’s wing. She helped launch the foundation’s Cultural Rhythms celebration in her junior year.
“The whole idea of Cultural Rhythms was less about asserting identity than freedom of expression in celebrating differences—it was a collective experience of many cultures coming together through music and dance,” says Rios. “You come to a place like Harvard and no one looks like you or expresses culture in the same way. Dr. Counter’s work on Cultural Rhythms personifies his belief in students and his liberating influence on their talents.”
Rios isn’t hard to find these days. As Treasurer of the United States, her signature appears on U.S. currency. For every undergrad helped by Counter who went on to prominence, like Native American activist Winona LaDuke ’82 or violinist Lynn Chang ’75 (who, at Counter’s request, performed at the 2010 Nobel Prize ceremony for the absent Chinese laureate Liu Xiaobo), there are hundreds of others living quieter lives who have carried Counter’s humanitarian message into their communities and careers.
The famed Explorers Club recently presented Counter with its highest honor, the Lowell Thomas Award, in recognition of his extraordinary scientific expeditions to remote corners of the world. To me, his expeditions into the realms of cultural understanding and expression in Harvard Yard are the greater achievement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hi sweetie, I just wanted to let you know that your sister and I are OK. We heard the news before we left for the mall.”
“The news of…” I asked, already feeling a knot tensing in my stomach.
My mother’s answer: “The shooting at Columbia Mall. Three people are dead.”
My Saturday morning had started out like most these past few weeks—I woke up at 10 a.m. to my iPhone alarm, breakfasted on a navel orange that I had nabbed from the dining hall the night before, and set off to Starbucks in the vain hope that I might find inspiration for my thesis in the bottom of a venti French roast. Staring at the blank screen of my Mac, the cursor blinking tauntingly, I quickly gave up hope on making any headway in my analysis of Indians in 19th-century British literature, and turned instead to my application for an introductory creative non-fiction course.
As I was outlining my essay—a hilarious critique (or so I thought in my caffeine-addled state) of the “influential person” essay that I wrote to get into Harvard—I got the call.
Five minutes later, I hung up, the queasy feeling in my stomach moving upward through my chest. I couldn’t process the conversation. But there it was, on the front page of CNN, Yahoo, the Washington Post, and Gawker—three people (including, allegedly, the suspected shooter) had died this morning, at approximately 11:15 a.m., from fatal wounds incurred during a madman’s rampage.
I’ve never owned a gun, nor have I ever felt a desire or need to arm myself. I don’t go hunting, or to the shooting range, or even to play paintball. Yet, for some reason, I’ve always held a personal belief that if the Constitution guarantees a right to keep and bear arms, whether to maintain a well-regulated militia or not, then one should have the right to do so—within strict limits, of course. But as the tragedy at Newtown proved, shooters don’t need to purchase weapons themselves in order to gain access to them.
While I was abroad at Oxford last spring and interning in London over the summer, my friends would relentlessly mock me (and not unjustly, I now think) for my opinion. Yet, I never entirely wavered on it, despite so many events this past year that should have changed my mind. But those were all in distant states and places, never fifteen minutes down the road from my house.
The shooting today has left me feeling shaken above all else, but also emphatically unsure of the stance that I’ve taken on the issue of gun control in the past. Should firearms be entirely outlawed? In a nation like the United Kingdom, where relatively fewer guns were in circulation by the time of their banning (mostly in the mid-20th century) than in America now, such a plan seems to have worked well. At home, where the Pew Research Center reports that there are an estimated 270 to 310 million guns in civilian hands, it seems unfeasible to enforce a ban on them and expect gun violence to depreciate considerably.
A surer route might be to ban the sale of ammunition, but considering how often and easily illicit narcotics are smuggled into the nation, some might argue that the same could be done with bullets, providing a new black market for the malevolently minded.
The most reasonable route would be to bolster restrictions on the purchase of firearms and ammunition and illegalize the sale of semi-automatic weapons. But what should those restrictions look like exactly? Would it make sense to conduct a mental health evaluation of not only the purchaser of a weapon but also all the people residing in his or her home? I admit that I don’t know the answer, but I do feel a newfound need to educate myself on the subject so that I can more actively engage in the debate.
I’m still at Starbucks now, shaking at my seat—at first, I thought, from the chill coming in through the window at my back, but now, I realize, from the shock of the news. My Facebook feed is filling up rapidly with calls for prayers and brief notes of incredulity. My neck tenses, and I wonder if I’ll be able to go back to writing my thesis this afternoon after what happened this morning.
I’m waiting to hear the police announce the names of the victims, and praying that the shooting doesn’t strike any closer to home.

Students returning to Harvard Square this week will encounter an altered dining scene as new restaurants have replaced several establishments shuttered in the past month.
 
Three Harvard Square institutions—Leo’s Place Diner, Tommy Doyle’s Irish Pub, and UpStairs on the Square—have closed their doors, a couple after over 30 years in service.
 
At the same time, the Square welcomed New York City-based burger and milkshake chain Shake Shack earlier this month, chocolate and candy shop Evelyn & Angel’s began constructing a cafe space at its Massachusetts Ave. location, and restaurant Alden and Harlow plans to open shop this week at 40 Brattle St. Evelyn & Angel’s should finish renovations by the end of January, according to owner Yalonda Howze.
 
Adding to the dining buzz are reports that Mike’s Pastry has begun the process to open a branch on 11 Dunster St. and plans for Felipe’s Taqueria to relocate and expand in a new location at 21 Brattle St. sometime this semester.
 
Though this wave of changes may be surprising to Cambridge diners, Harvard Square Business Association executive director Denise A. Jillson said that changes like these in the business landscape can be expected.
 
“The end of the year can be a logical time to end a business,” she said. “It’s always sad to see institutions like Leo’s close, but it’s always nice to have something new open in its place.”
 
Many of the restaurants that closed marked the end of several years of business in the Square. Leo’s Place shuttered at the end of December after almost 60 years as a mainstay establishment in the area. Similarly, Tommy Doyle’s shut down on Dec. 22 after nine years in Winthrop Square, and UpStairs in the Square followed suit on Dec. 31, following more than 30 years of service.
 


 
The owners of Leo’s Place, brothers Raffi and Njteh Bezjian, thanked patrons over Facebook in December for their support over the past decades. The co-owners could not be reached for comment. There are not yet plans for a new eatery  in the JFK St. storefront.
 
The former site of Tommy Doyle’s has already been repurposed as the home of the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, and, according to Jillson, the space occupied by UpStairs in the Square will be used by a new restaurant named Parsnip.
 
Owners of newly established eateries in the Square have expressed hope about their Harvard Square locations.
 
Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti said that he would like to see the Harvard Square location become a center for the Cambridge community.
 


The restaurant, located in Winthrop Square, has introduced several new menu options tailored to the Harvard community, including a Hasty Pudding milkshake and Crimson Red Velvet concrete, one of the chain’s signature custard shakes.
 
“Even though we do the core menu the same, we're constantly looking for ways to just be a part of that community,” Garutti said. “We want to be the ‘anti-chain’ chain.”
 
According to Garutti, the location has already experienced a high volume of customers as students return to Cambridge.
 
“Everyday has been busier and busier,” Garutti said.

For the fifth time since 2008, University President Drew G. Faust attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last week, emphasizing Harvard’s commitment to accessibility and the importance of the humanities in the global economy during interviews and panels at the conference.
"The World Economic Forum in Davos offers us an opportunity to connect with alumni from all over the world, to engage with university leaders and others on the transformation going on in higher education, and to advance the notion that education and economic prosperity are inextricably linked,” Faust said.
Faust stressed this commitment to higher education and the humanities throughout the week, participating in two of the forum’s panels. In one, she and Time Magazine managing editor Nancy R. Gibbs took the stage for a thirty-minute, one-on-one discussion regarding the “inextricable connection between history, creativity and economic competitiveness.” In another, Faust helped lead a discussion on the role of humanities in the digital age.
Faust also met with several alumni and prominent political and business figures. As she has in previous years, she and Kennedy School of Government Dean David K. Ellwood ’75 hosted a gathering of over 300 University alumni, according to Christine M. Heenan, the University’s vice president for government community and public affairs, who accompanied Faust on the trip. Faust met with London Mayor Boris Johnson, media magnate Arianna Huffington, and Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan as well, Heenan said.
 
Faust also made the international media rounds. In an interview Thursday with University of California at Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks and edX president Anant Agarwal, she told Fox Business anchor Liz Claman that rising tuition costs are a major concern to those in higher education.
“College cost is something that all of us who are involved in higher education in the United States are very concerned about,” Faust said. “Certainly we need to address it. But we also see very important ways in which the private institutions, of which Harvard is one, have tried to address this.”
In particular, Faust highlighted Harvard’s financial aid program, which enables students from families who make less than $65,000 a year attend tuition-free.
 
And in an interview with China Central Television Saturday she addressed the issue of gender parity, reiterating her statement that, “I’m not the woman president of Harvard. I’m the president of Harvard.”
 
Citing the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions, such as  among heads of government and in corporations, Faust said, “We need to make sure we challenge obstacles to women’s full participation, and we need to instill in young women and girls the ambition that they too can and should aspire to occupy those kinds of places.”
 
Before attending the Forum, Faust visited London and hosted the first international event for the University's ongoing capital campaign. According to Heenan, the event included a reception for alumni and a panel of faculty.

In the Undergraduate Council’s first meeting of the year, newly elected President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 led a discussion Sunday night on the role of the UC as an advocate for students on issues such as referendum action items. UC officers also provided updates on initiatives for the new year, including the delivery of student funds by direct deposit and the creation of a more user-friendly website.
 
Humorously dressed in a military uniform and equipped with a plastic sword, Mayopoulos openly discussed the relationship between the UC and the student body.
 
“Everyone knows about this problem the UC has with student communication,” he said.
 
As one method to bolster the relationship between the UC and the student body, Mayopoulos—formerly the vice presidential candidate on the joke ticket that won the UC presidential election in November—outlined Operation Ghost Protocol, an initiative introduced in an email to the student body earlier this month. The protocol, which mandates UC representatives to be in the dining halls of the house they represent and communicate directly with students, will begin next Friday, he said.
 
Members then brainstormed ways in which the UC could be perceived as an advocacy group, rather than solely a means of financial support. Many members agreed that the Council should be more visible and launch programs that directly impact students and allow them to voice opinions.
 
“Are we just going to be the ‘big daddy’ on campus where we’re going to give all our money [to students]?” said Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, Ed ucation Committee chair. “We need to get out of that cocoon of doing things the conventional way.”
 
In recent years, referendum questions, typically voted on by students during the UC presidential election, have served as potential areas for advocacy from the Council. In legislation passed last spring, the UC adjusted its rules so that the Council is only required to write an official opinion on a passed referendum when half or more of the student population votes. Because less than half of all undergraduates voted in the fall election, the UC is not bound to write opinions for the four referendum questions considered, all of which passed.
 
Though representatives have already been assigned to compile opinions on the referenda related to a discounted transportation pass for students and gender-neutral housing, Council members debated about whether the UC is obligated to advocate for a ban on plastic water bottle sales and push for University endorsement of immigration reform policy.
 
Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 cautioned the Council of the consequences of disregarding their rules and feeling obligated to take up the referenda issues.
 
“We set the thresholds for a reason,” he said. “We don’t want to be in a position where we are ignoring our own laws.”
 
Meanwhile, Dudley House representative Allison Gofman ’14 expressed concern about the students who had pushed for the initiatives, saying that the bottle ban activists would be “profoundly disappointed” if the Council did little to advocate their position. She later agreed to serve as the point person for presenting an opinion to the Council.
 
Still, Mayopoulos said that currently, the Council is still confused about exactly how to advocate for students.
 
“My concern is that we don’t really know what students are passionate about,” he said.
 
UC members also shared status updates on the Council’s initiatives for the year.
 
Kanuparthy discussed the problems the Council faced in distributing funds to student groups via direct deposit. Money does not always reach the accounts of organizations when students do not deposit checks, he said. And while the majority of Wintersession funds were granted using direct deposit, Kanuparthy said that because of concerns from both the Harvard administration and the UC, he could not confirm that the Council will definitely move to using only direct deposit.
 
In addition, Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, chair of the Student Relations Committee, announced that the new website, intended to be more user friendly, will be launched Monday.

The Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770—comprised of The Hasty Pudding Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and Harvard Krokodiloes—celebrated the unveiling of its new headquarters at the historic Hyde-Taylor House at 96 Winthrop St. with a dedication ceremony Saturday evening.
 
“This is the culmination of four years of work to reconstitute the Hasty Puddings Institute of 1770, and it is gratifying in the extreme to see it come together,” Hasty Pudding chairman and “Grand Sphinx” Andrew L. Farkas ’82 told a crowd gathered for the ribbon-cutting that included undergraduates and alumni, as well as Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher.
 
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, Dean of the Humanities Division Diana Sorensen, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith were all also in attendance at the club’s opening.
 
“This is such a great moment in history,” said Roger P. Cheever ’67, an associate vice president for alumni affairs and development. “This new home gives [the Pudding] the opportunity to do so many more things.”
 
The Hasty Pudding Club, which calls itself the oldest collegiate social club in the country, gave rise to the Theatricals in 1844 and the Kroks a capella group in 1946. The three distinct organizations merged into a single entity, known as The Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, in September 2012.
 
The building will be the sixth home to the Pudding in the institution’s more than two centuries of existence. Most recently, the organization occupied a building at 2 Garden St. Farkas said in an interview in December that the Institute had been searching for a new space for some time in anticipation of the 2013 expiration of its Garden Street lease.
 
 
According to a statement released last month, the Hyde-Taylor House appeared to be the “perfect fit,” for the organization, “with a long history of performing arts and philanthropy, which complements the Hasty Pudding Institute’s own history and mission.”
 
The space formerly housed the Irish pub Tommy Doyle’s, which closed its doors on Dec. 22, as well as the original House of Blues, which shut down in 2003. The Institute launched renovations following its takeover of the building in late December.
 
“Turning an Irish pub into a clubhouse and performance space required some creative solutions,” James P. Fitzpatrick ’12, the first full-time employee of the institute wrote in an email. Fitzpatrick’s title will be “Social Alligator.”
 
According to Fitzpatrick, the institute replaced the ice bins and coolers behind a large bar on the first floor of the building with additional shelving, seating, lamps, and books. “Can you think of anything more humorously Harvard than turning a bar into a study space?” he asked.
In an effort to ensure that the Pudding would be represented in every aspect of the building, the Institute repainted the interior in Pudding colors, added the Institute’s name to the front of the building, and displayed banners adorned with the Pudding’s logos and crest.
“It is going to be a space for study, a space for socializing, a space for camaraderie, rehearsal, performance, and fun,” Farkas said.
In his own brief remarks at the opening, Smith noted his “admiration for everything Andrew [Farkas] does,” and encouraged students to enjoy the facility.
Undergraduate leaders of the institute expressed excitement and enthusiasm for the new clubhouse.
“I am thrilled by the space,” Theatricals President Tony T. Oblen ’14 said. “I think it will serve our organization very well for years to come.”
Club President Matt G. Wardrop ’15 referred to the new headquarters as “an exciting catalyst,” and said that he appreciated that it will bring “all of the different parts of the Institute together under one roof.” 
The remainder of the evening featured musical performances by the Kroks and Theatricals, an original Hasty Pudding frozen custard designed by neighboring Shake Shack, and actual Hasty Pudding—cornmeal stirred into a thick batter in boiling milk or water.
 
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ annual production will continue to be held at its ancestral home and theater, Farkas Hall, at 10-12 Holyoke St., formerly known as the New College Theater. The theater is also home to the Hasty Pudding Lobby, a permanent museum exhibiting memorabilia from all three groups.

While the final score of the Harvard women’s basketball team’s 77-59 thumping of Dartmouth might not indicate it, the eventually lopsided contest started close, with the Big Green shooting well from the perimeter and the Crimson starters failing to rebound effectively. At the first media timeout, with just under 16 minutes to play in the first half, the heavily favored Crimson (12-4, 2-0 Ivy) found themselves trailing Dartmouth (3-13, 0-2), 10-7.
 
But coming out of the stoppage, the game turned. After the teams exchanged baskets, with a three-pointer by Dartmouth guard Fanni Szabo giving the Big Green a 13-9 lead, Dartmouth winger Milica Toskovic—a paint presence at 6’2”—committed her second personal foul and went to the bench. With Toskovic out, both teams took the opportunity to replace starters with fresher reserves. In this stretch and for the rest of the game, Harvard’s surging second unit took over, recapturing the lead and never giving it back to the Big Green.
 
THE SECOND UNIT
 
After Toskovic retired to the sidelines, a group of Harvard reserves went on to make their mark on the game. Senior center Elise Gordon entered for junior forward Temi Fagbenle. With Fagbenle on the bench, Gordon helped the Crimson continue to establish a dominant presence in the paint, showing impressive strength on two layups from beneath the basket.
 
“Elise is playing like a senior and just doing so much,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a talker and communicator on the floor, and she’s poised and she’s smart, [and] she’s being stepping up exactly like we want her to.”
 
Senior guard Jasmine Evans, a mainstay off the bench this season for the Crimson who has averaged eight points per game, provided a spark when she replaced fellow senior Melissa Mullins. With the game still close in the first half, Evans outhustled three Dartmouth players to win a loose ball on the Crimson’s baseline, and then threw the ball off an unsuspecting Big Green defender and out of bounds, earning the Crimson another possession. Evans finished with five points and two rebounds in 13 minutes of play.
 
But perhaps the biggest performance came from Kit Metoyer, a sophomore point guard who has occasionally had trouble on defense despite strong shooting and ball-movement skills. But on Friday, Metoyer was solid on both sides of the ball, and got the green light to turn on her three-point offense. Shooting from well-beyond the arc, Metoyer connected on three deep threes that served as back-breakers for the Big Green and sent the crowd at Lavietes to its feet.
 
“[Metoyer is] an incredible shooter,” Delaney-Smith said. “Kit can score like that. Kit hasn’t been playing the kind of defense I want, until tonight. She did exactly what we’ve been trying to get her to do defensively with few breakdowns...if we can get Kit playing the kind of defense we want, we will get that kind of scoring from her.”
 
Joining Metoyer, Evans, and Gordon in making major contributions to Saturday night’s victory was sophomore forward AnnMarie Healy, who entered late in the first half for Erin McDonnell and finished a perfect 5-5 from the field, including a trey from the wing. Healy finished with 11 points and nine rebounds.
 
“Our mentality is, get in there and do the little stuff,” said Healy of the Crimson’s reserves. “Basketball is a game of fundamentals, and no one is out there to make the big play. Everyone is out there to run the court in transition, have lockdown [defense], rebound, and put back the rebounds.”
 
CONTROLLING THE PAINT
 
Even in the first four minutes of Saturday's game, when a motivated Dartmouth squad was rebounding well and taking advantage of second-chance opportunities, the Crimson forced the Big Green into perimeter jump shots. Early on, Dartmouth’s senior point guard Nicola Zimmer looked like the best player on the floor, creating offense through passing and making difficult isolation jumpers. But eventually, the perimeter shots stopped falling, making the Big Green a team that could not score.
 
Players said that the Crimson’s dominance in the paint was the product of two weeks of practices since Harvard last faced Dartmouth and won in a close contest, 73-63, in Hanover.
 
“We didn’t play well the first time we played them, to be honest.” Delaney-Smith said. Friday night’s game plan, she added, amounted to “stop the damn drive...we wanted to take the paint away.”
 
Helping the Crimson to do just that was a tremendous, team-wide rebounding performance. The Crimson grabbed 45 rebounds on Saturday night to Dartmouth’s 26. With 19 offensive rebounds, moreover, Harvard won itself a slew of extra possessions, allowing the team to balloon its lead in the second half.
 
“We watched a bunch of game film from that first one, because it was a closer game,” senior guard Christine Clark said. “We wanted to control their post-player’s drive, because that really hurt us in the first game, and so our focus was...really playing team defense against them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard women’s basketball team (12-4, 2-0 Ivy) returned to the familiar space of Lavietes Pavilion after a four game road trip, it was a slightly less familiar set of faces leading the Crimson to a win against Dartmouth (3-13, 0-2) Saturday night. The Crimson’s bench players proved powerful on and off the ball, providing important defensive stops and a collective 35 points of scoring, en route to a 77-59 rout .
The game was a marked improvement from the squad’s last outing against the Big Green on Jan. 11, which was a much more tenuous victory, 73-63, in Hanover.
“They play the classic underdog,” said coach Kathy-Delaney Smith of Dartmouth. “They have nothing to lose so that’s your classic ‘go after us’ and that’s always a dangerous matchup.”
However, the team did not take the Ancient Eight opponent lightly and used the first matchup to improve the second time around. With two weeks between meetings, the Crimson took the time to review film and resolve the imperfections it experienced earlier in January. Most importantly, the team focused on blocking the Big Green’s post players.
“They create their three-point shots by driving and trying to kick it out,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Sophomore forward Lakin Roland] just bulled us over…. She just powered through us in the paint and that shouldn’t happen. We wanted to take the paint away.”
Roland is one of the inside players who have been leading the Dartmouth charge in recent weeks, having scored in the double digits in seven of her last eight games coming into to Saturday’s matchup. Roland, however, got into foul trouble early, and retired to the bench. Her 16 points may have topped the Dartmouth stat sheet, but it was not enough for the Big Green.
“We really were trying to get to our game the whole first half, and really running and getting to our inside presence,” said Crimson co-captain Christine Clark. “It didn’t really matter what they were doing it was just us getting to where we wanted to go.”
Clark once again led the offensive charge for Harvard, scoring a game-high 17 points, but it wasn’t just the starters who had flashy offensive play.
The bench as a whole provided nearly half the team’s points, sparked by the scoring performances of Kit Metoyer, AnnMarie Healy, and Elise Gordon. Metoyer and Healy, who are both sophomores, had career highs in points, with nine and 13 respectively.
“It feels great because we know that…we all have a purpose for this team,” Healy said. “We are a puzzle and everyone has a piece to that and everyone can help towards our goals for this season.”
The Crimson got out to a slow start, allowing Dartmouth the chance to take and make outside shots to put them up early, 13-9 at the first media timeout. With strong defense from junior forward Temi Fagbenle in the paint, the interior game was not an option, so senior Big Green guard Nicola Zimmer moved the game to the perimeter to try and connect with the basket from further out.
Harvard didn’t let Dartmouth get into a rhythm for long, as a breakout scoring sequence following the under-12 timeout in the first half gave Harvard a lead it would not relinquish. Tied at 15-all, senior guard Jasmine Evans drilled a trey to start a run to grow Harvard’s lead to double digits, 28-16.
Scoring only two fastbreak points, the Crimson was able to set up its offense nearly every time down the floor, creating an opportunity for players to make passes and cuts in order to get open. Throughout the night, they were rarely forced to rush the shot.
“As a team we have some unbelievable shooters and we have great distributors who can find people in their spots,” Metoyer said. “We are a very unselfish team.”
The two W’s against Dartmouth mark the start of the Ivy League portion of Harvard’s season, as the rest of their regular season schedule consists solely of conference opponents. Saturday’s win has given the team confidence as they continue in hopes of clinching an Ivy title, a feat it has not accomplished since the 2007-2008 season.
“It might be the best we’ve played all year team-wise,” Clark said. “We showed a lot on how deep we are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
With the rest of the College off for break, the Back Page is keeping up with the Harvard men’s basketball team (14-3, 1-0 Ivy) as it finishes the remainder of its winter schedule. With Harvard starting Ancient Eight play with a 61-45 win Jan. 11 against Dartmouth, staff writer David Freed previews the Crimson’s rematch against the Big Green in Hanover.
After a disappointing road loss to Florida Atlantic—the Crimson’s first to a team worse than it, per Ken Pomeroy’s rankings—Harvard will take to the road to finish a home-and-home against the Big Green.


Coach
Head coach Paul Cormier is in his second term with the Big Green, having rejoined the program in 2010 after being the head coach nearly two decades earlier, from 1984-91. Cormier has led the Big Green to three winning seasons, including consecutive second-place Ivy League finishes in 1988 and 1989 seasons. The 2012 season was a marked improvement over the first two in Cormier’s return, with the team winning five league games after posting back-to-back 1-13 seasons. Already this year the team has seven wins after recording just four victories in each of the previous three nonconference seasons.


Roster
Junior forward Gabas Maldunas, the Big Green’s best player, is out for the season with a knee injury after averaging 11.2 points and 8.5 rebounds through the team’s nonconference schedule. Minus Maldunas, the team will rely on a trio of sophomore starters—forwards Connor Boehm and Tommy Carpenter and guard Alex Mitola. Mitola and Boehm each average more than 10 points per game and bring in a powerful inside-outside threat to Dartmouth's attack.
The team’s lone senior is guard Tyler Melville, who averages seven points a game on 42.5 percent shooting from long range. As a team, the Big Green is shooting 36 percent from behind the arc and 46 percent overall. By contrast, the Crimson enters the game shooting 35 percent from three and 45 percent overall.


Early Season Play
Dartmouth finished its nonconference season with a .500 record, highlighted by a late-December stretch of four wins a row and six in nine contests. The new year has not been kind to the Big Green, however. Dartmouth is 0-4 in 2014, including a 14-point loss to St. John’s its last time out. The Big Green shared only two common opponents with Harvard, falling to both Vermont (62-53) and Bryant (87-77).
Sunday’s game kicks off a five-game Ivy League homestand for the Big Green, which—with Maldunas out for the season with a knee injury—will need to perform well at Leede Arena to keep alive any hopes of an Ancient Eight championship. Dartmouth went 5-3 in nonconference at home but finished with consecutive losses to Vermont and Hartford.


Series History
Dartmouth may have a 94-83 advantage all-time against Harvard, but the Crimson has won the last nine encounters, including its Ivy League opener, 61-45, behind 17 points from co-captain Brandyn Curry. Since 2000, the Big Green has won just five of 28 matches against the Crimson and its last win in the series came five years ago at home, 73-56.


Overall Matchup
Harvard enters this game leading the Ivy League with a plus-11.4 point differential and should be able to bump that up Sunday at Leede Arena. A 15-point loss to Florida Atlantic aside, the Crimson has been one of the nation’s most consistent programs. Harvard has not lost consecutive games since last season’s road league trip to Penn and Princeton, and determined not to let one loss balloon into two, should rebound with a victory over Dartmouth on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Olympic skiers will descend on Sochi in the upcoming days, the Harvard alpine and Nordic ski teams traveled just north of Cambridge this weekend to compete at the University of New Hampshire Carnival.
The Crimson men and women combined to finish in the middle of the pack, landing in eighth place out of 16 teams with 349 points. The giant slalom portion of the meet took place on Friday at Attitash Mountain in Bartlett, N.H., while the slalom skiers competed Saturday at Cannon Mountain. The Nordic team raced at the Jackson Ski Touring Center. The University of Vermont won the men’s event, while Dartmouth captured a victory in the women’s competition.
NCAA championships qualifier Rebecca Nadler led the charge for the women’s alpine team in the giant slalom with a 10th-place finish. The senior, who has been a consistent top finisher for the women, did not finish in this weekend’s slalom event.
Sophomore Samantha Udolf placed 31st for the Crimson in the slalom event, with freshman Kaitlyn Gibson finishing a few minutes behind Udolf in 35th. On the Nordic side, senior Jen Rolfes took the 12th spot in the 5k on Friday and 33rd in the 15k on Saturday.
For the men’s team, senior Ian Anderson took the top spot for the Crimson in slalom, coming in 38th, followed by freshman James Stevenson in 40th. Sophomore Simon Merryweather finished 34th in the giant slalom competition, though he was the only skier to complete the course for Harvard as Anderson, sophomore Matthew Mansson, and sophomore Jack Stobierski did not finish the race.
Nordic captain Chris Stock took the Crimson charge in the 10k with a seventh-place finish. In the 20k distance, junior Akeo Maifeld-Carucci claimed Harvard’s top spot on the day with a fourth-place finish.
“Specifically on the Nordic side, I think we had a good weekend, but we can definitely do better,” Ryerson said. “There were definitely a few people that skied really well, but others could pick it up a bit, and we know we have more in the tank.”
Despite the bone-chilling temperatures, weather was not a major factor in the weekend’s races. Bright skies on Friday increased visibility, making up for the 10-below temperatures. Light snow on Saturday decreased visibility and made the course a bit looser, but was not a major factor in racing.
“In terms of ski racing, the weather wasn’t too bad,” Anderson said. “Sometimes you have to race in rain, sometimes it’s super icy. I thought overall snow conditions were good. The snow was grippy both days, but definitely a little bit tougher [Saturday].”
On the Nordic side, the Crimson was worried about thin coverage, but the cold temperatures solidified the existing snow, making it smoother for competition.
“A lot of our athletes are used to racing in cold weather and temperatures quite a bit colder than this,” said senior Nordic skier Tony Ryerson. “It just made for beautiful trails and great skiing”
The team was pleased with its eighth place against an elite field of competitors.
“I think for the ski team as a whole, it was phenomenal to be eighth place,” Ryerson said. “Since I’ve been here…we’ve never broken the ninth place barrier, so that was absolutely huge for the Nordic alpine girls and guys as a whole, for all four teams to kind of put it together and rise above that ninth place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 13 Harvard men’s volleyball team looked to pick up the first wins of its 2014 campaign in back-to-back home contests over the weekend. Unfortunately, facing two of the top teams in the country, the Crimson (0-3) faltered, suffering a 3-1 loss to Lewis on Friday night, then falling in straight sets to Loyola the following afternoon.
LOYOLA 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard succumbed for the second time in as many days to high-quality opposition, losing 3-0 to No. 2 Loyola (6-1) on Saturday afternoon. The visiting Ramblers stifled the Crimson offense, which was only able to post a hitting percentage of .044 in response to .515 from its opposition.
“It was pretty similar to last night,” coach Brian Baise said. “They’re a real good serving team, and we had a hard time handling that serve, so our offense never got going. I think, to be honest, our defense struggled just as much. We can’t let the opposing team hit that well and expect to win. Those were the two problems today.”
At the outset, Harvard was able to keep up with the Ramblers. Early on in the first set, the match was tied at nine. However, Loyola went on a 5-0 run and never looked back.
From that point on, the visitors consistently piled on the pressure. The Crimson’s 25-19 loss in the first frame was the closest contest all afternoon. The Ramblers pulled away in the second and third sets with back-to-back 25-14 wins.
“They served really well, and we were out of system a lot of the time, not passing great, and it was tough to get in a rhythm,” co-captain Nick Madden said. “We would give them a little bit of a lead and then they would start taking aggressive swings that we weren’t able to return.”
Despite the loss, the contest against a tough opponent offered other benefits that Baise was keen to point out.
“We feel like we can compete at that level, and we learn a lot when we play those teams,” Baise said. “[From this weekend] I think we’re going to know a lot more about ourselves and what we need to do. So it’s always a lot of fun to play teams of that caliber, and hopefully we can make it a closer match next time.”
LEWIS 3, HARVARD 1
Harvard fell on its home court to No. 11 Lewis (5-2) in a 3-1 loss on Friday night. Despite narrowly taking the first set in a 25-23 win, the Crimson was unable to hold back the Flyers, who put on a dominant performance.
Harvard only gave up seven aces, and the Flyers committed 15 errors to the Crimson’s nine, but the away squad never gave up easy points on the service and consistently put pressure on the home defense.
“That was a pretty thorough defeat,” Baise said. “They made it really tough with their serve for the most part. When they’re serving like that, we couldn’t get our offense going at all. They hit almost .500 for the match, we hit .240—you’re never going to win a game when they out hit you two-to-one.”
Lewis pulled ahead in the second, third, and fourth frames, registering 25-16, 25-17, and 25-14 wins over the Crimson.
“Tonight we realized we just have to come out with more energy,” Madden said. “Our fire was down, and we were a little bit hesitant. We were waiting for them. They were on the offensive, and we were trying to defend against everything instead of us being on the offensive.”
Baise praised the character of his team as the Crimson tried to climb back into the match, but Harvard was never able to work its way back into contention.
“Our guys never give up,” Baise said. “Sometimes you can find a little crack, a little weakness, and put some pressure on them, but after that first set they were awfully good.”
Amidst the defeat, junior outside hitter DJ White put in a solid performance, leading the Crimson in kills and digs with 11 and seven, respectively.
“I think we had a tough match today and we are a better team than what we showed tonight on the court,” Madden said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—Following a loss, the Harvard men’s basketball team (15-3, 2-0 Ivy) has a simple saying: regroup and respond.
A game after the worst shooting performance of Crimson coach Tommy Amaker’s tenure, the squad issued an authoritative response with an 80-50 victory over Dartmouth (7-9, 0-2) on the road—the team’s largest road victory of the season. After struggling offensively early, the team shot 79 percent in the second half and 66 percent for the game—its best shooting performance under Amaker.
Co-captain Laurent Rivard, who led the team with 15 points, said that, after the defeat to the Owls, the priority was not letting a single loss turn into a string of defeats.
“Coach said he was disappointed in the way we played and the effort that we gave [against FAU],” Rivard said. “We needed to make sure we didn’t play that way again and let that turn into a slide or a big slump. You see other teams—Wisconsin, Ohio State—dropping one game and it turns into four.… We didn’t want that happening to us.
”On the defensive end, the Crimson shut down a Big Green attack that was missing its key cog. With junior forward Gabas Maldunas, who had 23 points when the teams met a week ago, out for the season with a foot injury, Harvard held Dartmouth to 20 first-half points and just 38-percent shooting for the game.
“Defense is our number one priority,” co-captain Brandyn Curry said. “Even when our shots aren’t falling, our defense should be there. I was happy with our effort out there tonight.”
Through eight minutes of play, however, the team had continued the mistakes that plagued it against Florida Atlantic last Tuesday. The Crimson missed four of its first six shots from the field and had nearly as many turnovers—five—as field goal attempts.
Enter Curry.
After a layup by sophomore wing Agunwa Okolie, Curry took over. Following a loose ball foul on the Big Green, Curry crossed over his mark at the top of the key and laid the ball up among three defenders. The senior picked off the ensuing inbounds pass and laid it up in one motion. After another Dartmouth turnover, Curry took advantage of a screen from junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi, knocking down a three-pointer to put the Crimson up by double digits. C urry and Harvard did not look back, taking a 37-20 lead into the break.
Curry finished with 14 points, one of four Crimson players in double digits on the night. After the win, Amaker called the team’s bench—which outscored its Dartmouth counterpart, 28-10—and the team’s balance two of the squad’s most important strengths.
“[That run] was critical for us because we talk about how we can be a tough team to scout or defend because we have a couple different individuals who can step up,” Amaker said. “Whether it is Agunwa at Fordham, whether it is Brandyn down at Rice, we have had a number of different guys absolutely carry us and set things up for us in a positive way.”
The Big Green stayed in the game due to the efforts of sophomores Connor Boehm and Malik Gill. The pair combined for 17 of the team’s 20 points in the first half, making eight of 11 field goals as the rest of the team combined to make just one of 13. After Harvard took a 21-6 lead, Boehm and Gill were responsible for seven points in a 9-0 Dartmouth run to draw within six.
In the second half, however, the Crimson quickly did away with any hopes the Big Green may have had of a comeback. Harvard moved the lead to 24 in two minutes and opened up a 32-point lead with eight minutes to go, with Okolie and Moundou-Missi combining for four straight dunks.
In the final period, along with shooting 79 percent from the field, the Crimson made all six of its threes and all seven of its free throws. Each Harvard player to attempt at least two shots connected at fifty percent or better from the field, and for the game the team shot 71 percent from three.
After the win, Amaker stressed the importance of taking care of business on the road.“
The veteran players in our locker room, they recognize that every game is critical,” Amaker said. “Every team in every conference thinks like that, but we have no postseason tournament. Our older guys who have won this league three years in a row, and the younger guys are following their lead. I am very pleased to see that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For its second straight game, the Harvard men’s basketball team was the clear favorite. Travelling to Dartmouth this weekend, the Crimson hoped to replicate its 16-point victory over the Big Green earlier this month.
But Harvard is no stranger to upsets. Just five days ago, the Crimson was favored by eight in its final nonconference game of the season and fell in historic fashion at Florida Atlantic University. In one of its worst performances of the Tommy Amaker era, Harvard missed 10 of its 12 shots from beyond the arc and shot 23 percent from the field, finishing with a record-low three assists.
Against Dartmouth, the Crimson looked like an entirely new team. In its best shooting performance under Amaker, Harvard shot the ball at a 66 percent clip from the field. Four Crimson starters finished in double-digits in a balanced offensive effort, with co-captain Laurent Rivard’s 16 points leading the team. Junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi contributed to the Crimson’s revived efficiency in the paint, chipping in 12 points on five-of-seven shooting from the field.
The drastic turnaround from last week’s matchup against the Owls bodes well for Harvard, whose offensive efficiency currently sits in the middle of the Ancient Eight pack after the squad’s dismal performance at FAU.
“Hats off to Florida Atlantic, they played a great game, but we didn’t feel good about ourselves and the big theme was don’t let up,” co-captain Brandyn Curry said. “Don’t let a bad game turn into a bad slump of games. You see that around the nation. Our motto after a tough loss is to regroup and respond.”
MALDUNAS-LESS
At home for the first time in the Ivy League season, Dartmouth took the court without its leader. Junior forward Gabas Maldunas—good for 23 points last time the two teams met—sat on the bench against Harvard after tearing his ACL earlier this week.
“We didn’t want to make a big deal out of it because, as we have seen [when junior Wesley Saunders was injured], teams can respond in a short period of time to losing one of your better players, if not your best player,” Amaker said.
Maldunas led the conference with 8.5 rebounds per game and topped the Big Green with 11.2 points per game. In Maldunas’ absence, the Dartmouth offense was forced to adjust against a consistent Crimson defense. Sophomores Connor Boehm and Malik Gill stepped up in Maldunas’ absence, but their 16 points apiece were not enough to replace the leading big man.
“Sometimes those things can energize a team in the short run and players can take it and run with it,” Amaker said. “They know they are playing more minutes and are going to get to touch the ball more, so we didn’t want to let up and change our game plan, whether Maldunas would be in or not. We stayed true to what we thought was our identity.”
While Maldunas sat on the sidelines, Harvard center Kenyatta Smith suited up for the first time this year. After a preseason foot injury cost Smith his first 17 games, the big man entered the game with just over four minutes to play. Though Smith had not yet participated in a contact practice since returning from injury, Amaker tapped him to take over with a comfortable 30-point lead in the second half. The junior only took one shot in his two minutes on the court—a layup in the post that clanged off the rim—but will be a potential impact player through conference play if he remains healthy.
“It was an opportunity to get him in there today and to get him going up and down to get game competition,” Amaker said. “He hadn’t played all year. He may not be back this year, but we are going to do everything we can to expedite the process.”
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
In last year’s second matchup against the Big Green, now-Harvard assistant coach Christian Webster had a very different role to play.
In a historic game one season ago, the Crimson came back from a 10-point deficit with 90 seconds left to play in order to remain undefeated in Ivy League play. Webster was instrumental in the overtime victory, hitting three clutch three-pointers in the final minutes of the game.
This time, Webster was on the bench as his former co-captain Rivard made it rain from beyond the arc. Nine of Rivard’s 16 points came from downtown, and only sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers took more shots, sinking four-of-six from deep. Though the Crimson has racked up the fewest three-point attempts in the Ivy League thus far this campaign, its 71 percent shooting from deep on Sunday was its best mark of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first matches in the spring dual season, the Harvard women’s tennis team split the weekend at the ITA Kick-Off Weekend. The 67th-ranked Crimson (1-1) knocked off the 63rd-ranked Missouri (2-2), 4-0, on Saturday to move to the final.
In the championship game, Harvard faced No. 2 Florida (2-0) with a bid to the USTA/ITA Indoor National Championships on the line. The highly-touted Gator squad proved too much for the Crimson, sweeping Harvard, 4-0, on Sunday.
FLORIDA 4, HARVARD 0
After shutting out the Tigers the previous day, Harvard struggled Sunday, as it faced some of the top collegiate players in the country.
Florida quickly clinched the doubles point in the dual with wins at the No. 1 and No. 2 doubles positions. Rookie standout duo Spencer Liang and Monica Lin suffered a 6-4 defeat at the hands of Kourtney Keegan and Sofie Oyen of Florida, while fellow Gator duo Brianna Morgan and Olivia Janowicz earned a 6-1 victory over the Crimson pairing of senior Hannah Morrill and freshman June Lee.
“I really don’t think our team was intimidated [playing Florida] at all,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We fought hard and showed we were capable of playing on their level. In many of the matches we were up at some point. I think it is just a matter of getting more practice and a little more confidence.”
Florida wasted no time taking the dual victory in the singles matches, winning in straight sets. Morrill faced No. 27 Oyne, and was unable to handle the Gator senior, falling, 6-0, 6-0. Sophomore Amanda Lin suffered a similar fate, losing, 6-0, 6-0, to No. 39 Keegan. The final Florida win came as junior Sylvia Li lost by a score of 6-3, 6-3 at the No. 6 singles position.
“The clinch-clinch format is tough because against a school like Florida, even though we lost 4-0, it doesn’t really reflect all of the matches,” Liang said.
With the dual clinched, the other singles matches were halted, including a battle between Liang and No. 17 Janowicz that was entering a third-set tiebreaker. Liang had taken the first set, 6-2, before Janowicz fought back to take the second, 6-4.
“I really liked our team this weekend,” Green said.  “We showed a lot of grit, showed a lot of personality, and showed a lot of potential.”
HARVARD 4, MISSOURI 0
The Crimson started the weekend strong behind solid play from its doubles pairings. At the No. 3 doubles position, the tandem of Amy He and Amanda Lin blew past Tigers Kelli Hine and Tracy Dong by a score of 6-0.
At the No. 1 doubles, however, the Missouri duo of Cierra Gayten-Leach and Cassidy Spearman took down the Harvard pair of Monica Lin and Liang. Lin and Liang were ranked 34th in the nation coming into the weekend.
“First of all, Missouri was ranked ahead of us as a team, so I think it was a good team win for us,” Green said. “We didn’t know that much about them going in. We just knew it was going to be a battle.”
With the doubles matches split 1-1, the doubles point came down to a tiebreaker set at the No. 2 doubles in a match between the Crimson duo of Morrill and Lee and a Tigers pairing of senior Rachel Stuhlman and sophomore Madison Rhyner.
After Morrill and Lee jumped out to a 5-1 lead, Stuhlman and Rhyner rattled off five straight games to tie the match. However, the Tiger comeback was not to be, as Morrill and Lee won the tiebreaker, 7-5, to take the match and the doubles point for the Crimson.
“Lee played really well in her matches this weekend,” Green said. “She has been stepping up tremendously. Also, Monica Lin played an exceptional match against Missouri as well.”
On the singles side, Lee didn’t let her match get quite as close, earning a 6-2, 6-1 victory at the No. 3 position to start the afternoon for the Crimson. Monica Lin followed in her teammate’s footsteps at the No. 2 position with a 6-3, 6-2 win over the No. 83 ranked Hine. The clinching victory for the Crimson came from the No. 6 match as Amanda Lin beat Dong, 6-1, 6-1.
