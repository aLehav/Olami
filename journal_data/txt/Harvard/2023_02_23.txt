On Creating Demons
A chicken crows evening in a hideaway hen–
house, songs of remembering and choosing.
I left my vitality, once, in the arm
of your apartment, a crooked yellow elbow. Do you remember?
Do you remember the sun? How it used to shine lucid and lemon,
distorted rectangles over honeyed hardwood,
and your cooing that all would pass. Edelweiss
and a stinging certainty that feelings stick
to words and words stick to everything.
Under your elbow/hand on hip I read
of riddled tudor homes and pairs of animals
reclaimed on deserts. Matted fur stuck to my
knee pads, cross-lined stencils on skin. Honey sun
replaced by a domed overhead light where I recited
salmon migration patterns to you and you read
me the stories with the endings. I have come
to pick up my belongings. The salmon
sweep, bronzed and bluing along the river.
The river’s growing cold. Hurry time. You remain
where I left you yet you are in the apartment,
you are elbow and cell bar and where
are my belongings? Porcelain sticks
like powdered seashells stuck to the heels
of my palms. I want so badly to release my demons
to you. To watch them chase you in dinnertime light.
I want so badly to tell you the things I never chose to hear.
Fresh Eyes
The mirror has morphed into a liar,
again, she has curved her frame like the spines
of the girls who swerve in the short videos
or the ridged back of a feral dog. My belly
bloats in her image, puffed like the interior
of a day old croissant, and I have begun
to feel the merge of morphed frames
(and fronts). If the man near that fountain
in London can lay corduroy jackets over valuable
real estate and name me a racist for minding
my business then you can surely call me.
Pick up the phone and scroll to the first letter
of my last name and tell me what I want to hear.
I have trouble with the dosage of my own
medicine, you see, like thick bubblegum Pepto Bismol
it slides down and I can feel it all the way.
Some baddies on the internet post photos
of neon bikinis and their slim beige bodies behind
them. My mirror is whispering New Years resolutions,
green juice, grind in the tri state area until March and then
hit Miami. Whores. Subway tiles either align in a fifty-
fifty split ratio else they break into thirds and it all goes awry.
My lips have always been too thin to be kissable and
I am jogging along the sidewalk in January and the air
is hazy and warm and soupy and I could be in Florida.
If you just pressed on the first letter of my last name,
we could start the whole story, you know. If you just
did all the initial work I could catch up, carry my weight,
somehow—(fingers crossed and) pinky swear.
—Dylan R. Ragas ’26’s column, “Yard Sale Organs,” is a collection of poems that attempt to make sense of a past—real, imagined, but mostly somewhere in between.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A spooky piano, backed by soft, twangy strings. Dove Cameron’s gentle voice beckoning the viewer into a suspicious hallway. Stark fluorescent fixtures plastering the white walls with flickering light. All of a sudden, Khalid makes an appearance, cracking the windows and letting some sunlight in. Forgettable verses and somewhat overly grandiose choruses ensue. With its mismatch of mystery and monotony, of ethereal singing and subpar writing, one question permeates Cameron’s new single “We Go Down Together” — Where were we going with this again?
“We Go Down Together” seems determined to capture Cameron’s signature style of gritty mystery which propelled her smash hit “Boyfriend” to the Top 20 of Billboard’s Hot 100. The undeniably eerie intro sets the stage for something similar, but a song that aims for mystery needs lyrics that match, and “We Go Down Together” simply doesn’t have them. Cameron’s first verse provides a mildly intriguing opening with “Dream in the light, dance in the dark,” but then follows it up with the cliche “You fill the spaces inside of my heart.” Passing the torch to Khalid, he fails to do much better. As he asks, “Am I really mine? Are you really yours?” the singer echoes what could be the opening of a sixth grade philosophy project more than a thought-provoking introspection.
Musically, “We Go Down Together” has its strengths. The chorus is undeniably powerful, showcasing reverb-filled rhythms and soaring, dynamic melodies. The ending takes this up a notch, letting the listener forget the rest of the song and instead bask in the raw and beautiful combination of Cameron and Khalid’s vocals, with the heartfelt swell of the strings to match. That first moment when Cameron and Khalid harmonize — creating a single wave-like melody — stands out as three seconds of truly stunning sound. Cameron’s voice effectively complements the song’s feel; her soft storytelling interspersed with quick, pointed vibrato that effectively contrasts the falling, dark instrumentals. If it weren’t for subpar lyrics and verse production that leaves the listener asking for more, “We Go Down Together” could have the makings of a real hit.
While Khalid’s feature will undoubtedly provide millions of streams to this single, Cameron’s past work proves that she is capable of far more. In the end, “We Go Down Together” is ultimately a track lesser than the sum of its parts. Khalid’s contribution added an uneventful verse with pedestrian lyrics, and though the duo certainly had shining moments, the words “we go down together” will never be associated with a song that isn’t The Chainsmokers’s “Paris.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though we may be experiencing warmer temperatures, it is no secret to seasoned New Englanders that we are in Fool’s Spring — that is, the sporadic bout of 60s and sunshine that makes Punxsutawney Phil look like a fraud until we are back to frigid temperatures in just a few days.
So, given the ongoing winter, here are some fun outings that will make you dread the cold a bit less:
Ice skate at the Boston Common Frog Pond 
Whether experienced in the art of ice skating or not, every Bostonian must glide across Frog Pond at least once! Conveniently located right past the Red Line’s Downtown Crossing stop, skating at Frog Pond is a great way to make memories with friends, family, or significant others. Given the high number of college campuses in the Boston area, Frog Pond even offers a designated “College Night” every Tuesday from 6-9 PM, during which your HUID will get you a steep 50% discount on admission.
Visit the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum 
If you’re looking for a more tropical indoor location, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is worth a winter visit! You’re sure to enjoy a stroll around the gorgeous, historic galleries of the Gardner Museum, all of which overlook a sunny indoor courtyard of tropical plants. Art history lovers and true crime fans alike should note the eerie sight of empty frames in the museum’s Dutch Room, the site of the most famous art heist in modern history. Admission is free for Harvard students and discounted for affiliates through Harvard Innings and Outings.
Take a Polar Plunge into Walden Pond
Feeling inspired by Thoreau? Or perhaps in need of a good adventure? If so, gather your most daring friends and head to Concord, MA for a quick dip in Walden Pond. After enjoying some Taylor Swift-style “Snow on the Beach” with a nice walk around the pond, take a polar plunge right into the water! This is sure to leave you with great memories — and perhaps a mild case of frostbite, too.
Visit the Cambridge Public Library
If you’re looking for something more local but yearn for a location beyond Harvard’s campus, the Cambridge Public Library is worth a stop. Located just beyond Harvard Yard, the Main Library will leave your jaw on the floor with its stunning architecture, rich history, and vast collection of books. The library not only boasts a castle-like facade, but also features gorgeous views of the Boston skyline from its upper levels. Grab your favorite winter read and a warm drink and stop by!
Visit Beacon Hill Books and Cafe
A visit to Beacon Hill Books and Cafe — a recent addition to the Boston area — is the perfect way to escape the Harvard bubble for a few hours without falling behind on classwork. This cozy environment — which boasts a gorgeous interior design complete with large windows and plants — is perfect for working on papers and studying for midterms. In addition to the idyllic study space, Beacon Hill Books and Cafe also offers regular events that would make for a fantastic group outing or study date.
Take a winter walk at the Blue Hills Reservation
Last but certainly not least, escape the city with a trip to the Blue Hills Reservation for a winter hike. Though it's only a 30-minute drive from campus, Blue Hills feels like another world with its gorgeous views, soaring snowy hills, and magical forests, all enhanced by a glittering blanket of snow. Bundle up, build a snowman, and head over to Milton, MA!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New Zealand singer and songwriter, Benee, returns to the music scene for her first single of the year — and this time, she’s pulling up in a green automobile. After blowing up on TikTok with the inescapable pandemic-era tune “Supalonely” back in 2020, Benee has been building her repertoire one EP and single at a time. And with a nearly one-year hiatus in 2022 from releasing solo music due to touring, the New Zealand singer-songwriter is back with her new single “Green Honda” in advance of her recently announced 2023 Coachella appearance.
“Green Honda,” it turns out, is not entirely new to fans. Versions of the track have been performed at various concerts over the past year, in unreleased forms. The titular green vehicle, as well, is also already somewhat familiar to fans, as it was featured on the cover of her 2019 EP “Stella & Steve.” The Honda Integra seen on the cover of “Green Honda” was a gift from her grandmother, which the singer (real name Stella) affectionately named Steve.
However, while the track and its imagery may not be new, the single does mark a transition toward a novel sound for the singer-songwriter. “Green Honda” sees Benee blend elements of indie rock and electropop to produce a driving and compelling — though somewhat basic — instrumental. It’s a far cry from the bedroom alt pop that defined her rise to fame, or the soft and dreamy blend of hyperpop and indie pop on her latest EP, 2023’s "Lychee."
To that end, the song opens with static noise, which gives way to piercing vocals from Benee: “That was a waste of fucking time.” She’s reflecting on, presumably, a past relationship, which only leads to more biting lyrics, as Benee declares, “You were a waste of fucking time / Since I left you I've been great / You were my biggest mistake.”
The lyrics, which sometimes venture into the unremarkable — “It's safe to say I am surprised / You've made a huge mess of my life” — are thankfully elevated by a catchy and energetic guitar riff. Like the titular green vehicle, the instrumental is flashy and moving.
Vocally, while previous songs saw Benee employ extensive autotune, this song features a half-rapped, half-lyrical delivery, which( almost paradoxically) brings a latent, effervescent energy to the song. Benee’s casual and almost lackadaisical monotone clashes with the energetic and colorful instrumental backing.
However, with the hook returning five times after introduction, and a bridge that is just a stripped down version of the former, the track is at least a little repetitive. Verses are similarly elementary; lines like “I cringe at everything they say / And you're just like them, boy, don't play” certainly don’t push any lyrical frontiers.
While “Green Honda” isn’t terribly innovative, it’s fun, catchy, and snarky. Sometimes, music can just be pleasing to the ear — And “Green Honda” accomplishes that.

On their new single “Call Me What You Like,” British indie-rock band Lovejoy explores the complexities of human relationships. Composed of Wilbur Soot as the frontman, Joe Goldsmith on the guitar, Ash Kabosu as the bassist, and Mark Boardman on the drums, the up-and-coming band claims they are ushering in a “new era of Lovejoy” with the release in promotion of their upcoming EP, currently referred to by the unofficial name “wu&io.” With a more intense and energetic sound than their previous works, Lovejoy is well on their way to making this new era a reality.
The lyrics on “Call Me What You Like” paint a vivid picture of a relationship that is both uncertain and driven by a deep desire for connection. The chorus of the song is particularly powerful; the lead vocalist sings "You can call me what you like / As long as you call me." By expressing their willingness to accept any label or name as long as it comes from the person they care about, the band is making a powerful statement about the value of human relationships and the lengths people will go to in order to feel seen and understood. In the first verse, the sonics are simple, with the guitar mainly carrying the track, but as the song moves into the chorus, it becomes more intense and aggressive, with the pace picking up and the compressed drums and bass beginning to drive the beat.
The second verse explores the uncertain nature of the relationship, with Lovejoy unsure if their crush wants or needs them. Lyrics like “And you can taste thе beer / On every guy that talks to you” inspire a sense of jealousy or insecurity that is relatable to anyone who has found themselves in a complicated situation. This detailed lyricism paints a vivid and relatable picture of Lovejoy’s insecurity in their relationships.
The thematic undertone shifts dramatically with the bridge as Lovejoy acknowledges their own flaws, paranoia, and anxiety. This vulnerability and self-awareness is a welcome contrast to the bitter and accusatory tone sprinkled throughout the rest of the song. It adds a layer of complexity to the themes already explored in "Call Me What You Like," including the desire for connection and validation, the uncertainty of relationships, and the challenges of accepting one's flaws and vulnerabilities. By acknowledging their own struggles with paranoia and anxiety, these lyrics bring a level of introspection and self-awareness that deepens the emotional impact of the song. The sound in the bridge builds a feeling of suspense employing a slower tempo and a more subdued mix. In the absence of heavy instrumentation, Gold's vocals take center stage, particularly in the line, "I'm not paranoid, I'm a realist."
While Lovejoy's "Call Me What You Like" is a powerful track, it's not without its flaws.The vocal editing in the chorus detracts from the song's overall intensity and quality. Although at times the vocals don't quite cut through the mix, and the production feels sloppy in places, which takes away from the song's potential impact — nevertheless, the punchy instrumentation and meaningful lyrics in the chorus demonstrate the band's potential for creating memorable and emotionally charged music.
Overall, Lovejoy's "Call Me What You Like" explores the complexities of human relationships in a way that is both relatable and emotionally resonant. The song's vivid imagery and emotionally charged language make it a standout track that is sure to connect with listeners on a deeply personal level.

Hip Hop music has taken over as one of the most popular genres in the world, but its popularity can erase the unsung pioneers of each era. The genre, dating back to DJ Kool Herc releasing “Back To School Jam” on Aug. 11, 1973 in the rec room of his building in the South Bronx, is now heard around the world. But the rise in popularity threatens to overshadow the history of young Black men and women across the U.S. who had no idea that their bars would turn into packed tours and a life of fame. While its entire legacy cannot be easily summarized, these four categories can help break down some of the most influential contributors to rap’s legacy. This list is a compilation of the underappreciated yet historic rap songs that continue to inform the artists of today, honoring hip hop as Black history.
Groups:
“Scenario” by A Tribe Called Quest (1991)
A Tribe Called Quest's alternative and energetic style makes their songs more hype than today’s 808-filled rap. With a spectacular outro by Busta Rhymes — the only non-member of the group featured on the song — audiences can hear the best of Tribe and the talents of their peers.
“The Next Movement” by The Roots (1999)
Philadelphia’s #1 rap crew may go under the radar for the mainstream hip hop fan, but lead MC Black Thought’s skills place him on many of the best rappers all time lists. Although this song does not capture his multitude of skills, it is a great introduction to the talents of the Roots crew.
“Da Art of Storytellin’ (Pt. 1)” by OutKast (1999)
André 3000 and Big Boi’s experimental style and Southern roots have produced some of the most captivating stories in rap music. This song — as well as “Da Art of Storytellin (Pt. 2)” — demonstrates the unique capabilities this collaboration brings to the table.
“Self Destruction” by Stop The Violence Movement (1989)
Hip Hop and social justice have always gone together, and “Self Destruction” unified the rap community after the alleged murder of Boogie Down Production DJ, Scott La Rock. The song brings together all of the great old and new school rappers of the East in a piece dedicated to ending gun violence.
Female Artists:
“The Jump Off” by Lil Kim (2003)
Lil Kim laid much of the groundwork for the powerful women breaking records today. She set the standard, and “The Jump Off” shows why.
“I Wanna Be Down” by Brandy, MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Yo Yo (1994)
Women in rap have produced hits for years and this track features four of the best and brightest. The flirty riffs, beautiful singing, and rhyming heard in “I Wanna Be Down” set off Brandy’s R&B stardom.
“Pass Da Blunt” by Missy Elliot (feat. Timbaland) (1997)
Missy Elliot and Timbaland played a crucial role in the expansion of rap beyond the East Coast versus West Coast rivalry. The Virginia natives incorporate reggae elements in this track, pushing music production forward with their innovation.
“Uknowhowwedu” by Bahamadia (1996)
Bahamadia produced some of Philadelphia’s best rap music in her heyday, but many do not know that her LP was the first to be co-produced and entirely written by a woman, Antonia D. Reed. Her trailblazing and sonic creativity cannot be forgotten.
East Coast:
“It Ain’t Hard to Tell” by Nas (1994)
Nas’s “Illmatic” can be found on any hip hop fans' all time albums list, but “It Ain't Hard to Tell” has layers often left undiscovered. His lyricism remains unparalleled and his storytelling prowess pushed the genre forward.
“Eric B. Is President” by Eric B. & Rakim (1987)
Rakim reigns as a hip hop great left underappreciated by Gen Z. Featuring one of the most recognizable first bars in rap history, there is no way to forget about this Long Island duo.
“Ain’t No Half -Steppin’” by Big Daddy Kane (1988)
Big Daddy Kane is another underrated star of the Golden Age of Hip Hop. Kane is a pure example of the MCs that once defined hip hop’s rise and this song exemplifies his lyrical greatness.
“Ten Crack Commandments” by The Notorious B.I.G. (1997)
While Biggie remains one of the most recognizable rappers of all time, his legacy cannot be summarized in just his top hits. This track provides a closer look into the psychology of those in the drug game.
West Coast:
“Express Yourself” by N.W.A (1989)
When N.W.A faced the FBI in a battle against censorship in rap music, the group responded with a diss to rappers that censor themselves for airtime paired with a music video commenting on the policing of Black men in America.
“Runnin’” by The Pharcyde (1995)
Produced by the late great Detroit producer J Dilla, the South Central rap group paints a vibrant picture of how young men deal with bullying and asserting themselves in an unkind world.
“Mind Playing Tricks On Me” by Geto Boys (1991)
While the Geto Boy hail from Houston, Texas, no guide to hip hop would be complete without the group’s #23 Billboard hit. Sampling the great Issac Hayes’s “Hung Up On Me Baby,” the track has a jazz groove while sharing the mental stressors of gang life.
“The Humpty Dance” by Digital Underground (1990)
This Oakland group was one of the first to emerge from West Coast Alternative music. The late Shock G’s iconic character Humpty Hump rhymes in this joke-filled classic.

Afrobeats finds its traditional roots in music created throughout West Africa and the diaspora. With strong ties to Ghana, Nigeria, and the U.K., Afrobeats has expanded globally through increased collaborations with artists of varying genres and international origins.
The musical genre began early in the 20th century through an intersection of Ghanaian and West African music with Western jazz. First being known as highlife, this combination of sounds developed over several decades with additional influences garnered from modern Western styles. Fela Aníkúlápó-Kuti, a Nigerian musician, created a band called Nigeria 70 after playing highlife for several years, and in doing so, debuted an album that created the fundamental sound of Afrobeats.
Several other popular artists that established Afrobeats as a genre include drummer Tony Allen, Roy Ayers, and Antibalas. In all, the genre is characterized by its inclusion of several genres, including elements of African music and funk, creating a structure more similar to jazz or fusion rather than pop.

For those looking to be a legend on aux at the next function, here are a few songs to add to your repertoire.
1. “Essence” — Wizkid ft. Tems
“Essence”’s rhythmic style has catapulted both the song and Wizkid into both Afrobeat and worldwide acclaim. Featuring Tems’s euphonious voice, “Essence” climbed the charts for its modern R&B/Afrobeats fusion and a trademark sensual style. Since its release, Wizkid has won five BMI awards and a Grammy in 2022 for Best Global Music Performance for this song. Most importantly, however, the song holds a prestigious spot on Monique’s Apple Music top 10 listened to songs of 2021 and 2022.
2. “Calm Down” — Rema & Selena Gomez 
“Calm Down” is currently topping Billboard’s US Afrobeats chart, and has remained in this position for the last 48 weeks. Although she is an artist not traditionally known for her involvement in Afrobeat tracks, Selena Gomez accompanies Rema’s light, energetic, and metrical style to form this instant hit. Being one of the youngest songs on this list, 2023’s “Calm Down” presents an ongoing trend in Afrobeats: openness to explore modern music trends and styles.
3. “Drogba (Joanna)” — Afro B 
Afro B is a British singer and songwriter widely known for his hit “Joanna,” peaking at number 23 on the Billboard US R&B/Hip-Hop Charts. “Joanna” combines the traditional steady rhythm of Afrobeats with the strong back beat of a R&B hit.
4. “Peru” — Fireboy DML 
A Nigerian singer signed to YBNL Nation and raised in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Fireboy DML was not only the first Afrobeats artist to perform on the BET Awards mainstage but also the voice behind hits like “Bandana,” “Sere,” and “Playboy.” From his 2022 album “Playboy,” “Peru” is the perfect song to slow whine to when the lights are dim and the bass thrums a tad too heavy.
5. “KU LO SA- A COLORS SHOW” — Oxlade 
If you’ve ever wondered what summer sounds like — look no further. Less than three minutes long, Oxlade’s “KU LO SA” is a brief but bright combination of tipsy longing, sunburnt cheeks, and the sensation of locking eyes across a crowded rooftop bar. Not only has the track peaked at No.5 on the Billboard Afrobeats U.S. Chart and garnered over 159 million streams on Spotify alone, but it’s on a heavy rotation in Anya’s personal playlist — which is obviously the true marker of success.
6. “Free Mind” — Tems
The recipient of countless accolades — a Grammy Award, three NAACP Image Awards, two BET Awards, and multiple American Music Awards, to name a few — Tems has carved out a space of her own in the Afrobeats scene. While virtually any song from her discography deserves a place on this list (“Higher” deserves an honorable mention), “Free Mind” is a slowed R&B-esque reminder to value moments of peace in a world that never seems to take pause.
7. “Last Last” — Burna Boy
It wouldn’t be an Afrobeats playlist without the king himself: Burna Boy, who is ranked No.197 on Rolling Stone’s 2023 list of the top 200 singers of all time, is a cornerstone of the Afrobeats genre. “Last Last,” a hit single off of his most recent album “Love, Damini,” is a heartbreak anthem for anyone who feels tempted to stray to their vices in the darker times.
8. “Bloody Samaritan” — Ayra Starr
The lead single off of Nigerian singer-songwriter Ayra Starr’s debut studio album “19 & Dangerous,” “Bloody Samaritan” layers melodic verses over punchy Afro-pop. A mix of smooth violin, drum beats, and an easy flow, “Bloody Samaritan” wards off bad energy and reminds listeners of the power of authenticity.
9. “Fall” — Davido 
Davido, an American-born singer and producer with Nigerian roots, made his debut in year with the group KB International and since then, has signed with Sony Music, created his own record label Davido Music Worldwide, and signed with RCA Records. “Fall” comes from Davido’s electric album “A Good Time” and quickly became the longest charting Nigerian pop song of all time in Billboard history.

A widespread warren of steam tunnels sprawls under Harvard like a secret network of arteries, circulating the lifeblood of the University’s heating system. From the Business School in the south to the River Houses, Harvard Yard, and the Law School in the north, all the buildings on campus seem to be connected by these complex, walkable catacombs.
However, the same tunnels that unite most of Harvard also divide it.
As commonly perceived by students, the Radcliffe Quadrangle is an outlier. An independent system once belonging to the eponymous women’s college brings together Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer Houses. Twenty feet below Moors Hall in Pforzheimer, three menacing cylindrical boilers provide heat to the Quad houses, the mechanical beating hearts of their own twisting system of hot tunnels.
Just as the Quad tunnels are separate from the extensive tendrils of Harvard’s main network, the Quad itself is widely considered a remote place, fundamentally distinct from the rest of Harvard. It is seen as an “other,” something undesirable to students and perhaps implicitly less worthy of the infrastructure supporting the rest of the College.
Knowingly or not, in the spring of their first year, students trace the path of the central steam tunnels as they complete “River Run” — a ritual meant to protect its participants from the curse of the Quad. And if they are fortunate enough to get a River House, they often spend their next three years opposed to venturing out of the domain of their own heat source.
The current perception of  the Quad as less prestigious than the River  is intimately tied up with gender and racial bias. The space originally existed as part of Radcliffe College, which was built as a monument to the exclusion of women from Harvard. It was inherently constructed to separate one group from another, and gender divisions continued long after its integration. The only reason the shuttle service was introduced in 1973, for instance, was because male athletes housed in the Quad complained about unequal resources relative to the River Houses — never mind that women had already been making that walk for decades.
After Radcliffe merged with Harvard, the barrier between the two became racialized, as many Black students were often geographically relegated to the fringes of campus life. The randomized housing lottery system was introduced to sweep this issue under the rug, but physical and social barriers between the Quad and the River are still pervasive. The Quad continues to exist as a place of isolation, ridicule, and division.
Beginning the story of Harvard’s tunnels with Radcliffe and the Quad paints a much more nuanced picture of our history. By recognizing the ways in which the Quad is still separate from the main campus, we learn the troubled aspects of our history and enable ourselves to reckon with the past more authentically and rigorously. Students should know why their heat comes from different sources, just as they should be aware of the history of discrimination surrounding the Quad.
We should also be wary of diminishing Radcliffe’s legacy in the name of equity and ignoring the origins of today’s Quad. In the name of integration, Harvard whitewashed its own wrongdoings and invalidated the experiences of many marginalized students.
Though an integrated steam network between The River and The Quad is probably not feasible, we should address the disparate experiences of Quadlings while preserving a connection with Radcliffe in whatever ways we can.

The unseasonably warm winter’s day is no longer quite so pleasant a surprise.
Students strolling through the Yard this month have gazed up at an unblemished blue sky, charmed by a still sunlit Cantibrigian February. But as we reintroduce short sleeves and outdoor study sessions to our day-to-day routines, we realize: We are basking in the warmth of our planet withering.
This is the trick of climate change. One day, it’s in the double-digit negatives; the next week, it’s in the 60s. The misinformed are distracted by the thermometer’s rise and fall while a much fiercer story — the fundamental altering of our planet’s atmosphere — forges forward, unabated. We miss the burning forest for the trees.
Here is the forest: Climate change is real, it’s here, and it’s accelerating. Nine of the top ten hottest years on record in the contiguous United States have occurred in the last quarter century. The world has just exited its hottest decade since thermometer-based observation began. With global average temperatures rising at 0.32 to 0.55 degrees per decade since 1979, the current decade is poised to be our new hottest.
From many vantage points, these statistics seem abstract and far-off. But each further inch the proverbial thermometer rises touches millions of lives. With one metaphorical inch, thousands of acres of ancient California redwoods are blazed to ash. With another, more than 30 million people in Pakistan watch their homes get pulverized by raging floodwaters. A third inch, and natural disasters dig 2 million premature graves, leaving behind millions more who will never again smile back at their loved ones.
Do not tell us it’s just an inch. Today and tomorrow, climate change is the greatest threat humanity faces — perhaps the greatest it has ever faced. How we respond is civilization’s toughest test.
Our world runs on carbon. Accordingly, decarbonization is a uniquely multifaceted problem, touching every country and every sector. Harvard, with its fingers spread across dozens of academic fields, is especially well-positioned to unravel this issue.
Most immediately, the University should mobilize the full extent of its colossal research capacity to kickstart a once-in-a-generation interdisciplinary campaign dedicated to devising partial answers to the climate crisis. Harvard must encourage collaboration of scholars across fields — from policy experts to environmental scientists, from economists to engineers — to investigate reducing emissions and curbing the impact of our already-immense carbon footprint.
The University itself must fund this research, instead of relegating these costs to private polluting financiers, a practice that leads to biased results. Harvard has no shortage of departments to fund and issues to prioritize, but the urgency of the climate crisis should echo in administrators’ minds as they make tough but critical funding decisions.
Although research may represent the highest-impact opportunity for a school like Harvard, the University’s efforts toward sustainability cannot be left at the lab. Sowing sustainability into the very fabric of our campus life, with greener buildings and more accessible recycling, is vital too.
A complete embrace of sustainability requires grappling with the particular nature of the climate crisis: It is overwhelmingly caused by large corporations, but exerts a disproportionate impact on poorer people and countries in return. By more closely integrating climate change into curriculum and making climate-oriented career paths accessible and appealing through the Office of Career Services, Harvard can train the next generation of citizen leaders, policy-makers, and private sector executives in climate change solutions.
Still, we each have an essential personal responsibility to read about climate change, learn to refute disinformation, and mobilize in environmental justice efforts. Restricting our climate strategy to broad, structural criticisms of corporate malpractice is just as misguided as hoping recycling alone will revert the alarming increase of temperatures worldwide.
Most tragedies happen in an instant moment: one second invisible, the next devastatingly real. Climate change isn’t like that. It creeps up on us. It simmers and boils us like frogs in once-tepid water. Today, an unseasonably warm day should sound a screeching cry to do everything in our power to change. By the time 60 degree weather is seasonable for February, it will be far too late.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scientific method: hypothesis, experiment, and conclusion.
This is how I understood science at a Texas high school; this is also a notion that most people, disillusioned with the motions of the scientific method, leave high school with. I myself chose the humanities. But the notion that we must associate science with a strict adherence to method and materialism limited what I thought I could contribute to the scientific process.
Children see the material universe as the ancients perceived before their imagination is restrained: lacking fundamental facts and methodical rules, with no prior scientific foundation to stand upon. Without predecessors and modern instruments, how did the ancients once frame the material universe?
I turn to the Romantic poet, William Blake, to describe the child’s imagination in a series of poems titled “Songs of Innocence and Experience.” Blake’s poems represent innocence as youth and naivety; experience as mature and rational. The opposition between imagination and materialism resembles the irreconcilable nature of innocence and experience.
Blake wrote in reaction to the rise of Francis Bacon’s, Sir Isaac Newton’s, and John Milton’s emphasis on materialism. Blake viewed their emphasis on materialism and exclusion of imagination as the creation of a “false deity” of Enlightenment scientific realism, which  limits our vision and understanding of the material universe. Such a perspective disavowed our access inward to what Blake elucidates as “Worlds of Thought” — the imagination — limiting us to sense perception.
Without a full science education to teach how imagination and materialism have complemented each other in Aristotle’s to Einstein’s theories, I fear the end of scientific progress and echo Blake’s ultimate concern about the destruction of existence.
Do we turn less and less inward as more is discovered? High school nurtured the intuition that there was no step, if science can be reduced to steps, to be imaginative. I prepared before each lab under the guidance of a laminated scientific method poster, sliced scientific fact from a textbook to stitch into my hypothesis, and recorded data into tables and models to affirm the textbook in my conclusion.
Behind the fascination of each marvel outside the classroom was a calculable conclusion. I wondered how the scientific discoveries of Nicolaus Copernicus’ heliocentrism and Friedrich Miescher’s identification of “nuclein,” or DNA, were possible without the essential elements of imagination and surprise. How do we progress without imagination to complement materialism?
I thought access to “Worlds of Thought” were exclusive to the humanities. It often feels as though the main prerequisite for humanities, as a subjective discipline, is experience and imagination, whereas that of science, as an objective discipline, is an intensive understanding of fact.
Why is the imagination not associated with science education more often? I became disillusioned with science. I chose the route of humanities because the worlds within had high potential to provide insight on the one I inhabit.
I see a friend’s exhaustion from a p-set, their mind overwhelmed and fried. How does science seem to vacuum the imagination from their eyes? The narrator of Walt Whitman’s “When I Heard the Learn’d Astronomer” expresses their tiredness of “proofs, figures [...] charts and diagrams.” What more can the imagination — beyond facts and models — comprehend about our universe? The narrator wanders outside of the astronomer’s lecture into an immersion of night air, captivated by the mysticism of the universe’s appearance of infinite stars and coordinates. The narrator turns away from modern science.
In Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” Professor Krempe reproaches Victor Frankenstein’s interest in the imaginative theories of the ancient Agrippa and Paracelsus; their theories represent “exploded systems” and “fancies” that modern science falsifies. Indeed, the ancients’ theories cannot withstand modern science; but the professor’s exclusion of their theories as “sad trash” dismisses imagination as a relic, obsolete to modern science without credit to the discoveries made possible due to their theories. Victor turns away from the demands of modern science.
I do not foresee a Nobel surfacing in a high school lab. But I resonate with Walt’s narrator and Victor’s wishes. I wish authorities in education were equally invested in the individual’s intuition, emboldening peers and me to wonder with what is known and largely unknown about our material universe. To be pro-imagination is conflated to be anti-science, but this contradiction inhibits the harmonious and irreconcilable nature of imagination and materialism.
Progress in science is thought to be the slow retirement of the imagination. But science needs the imagination to see within and outside our reliance on scientific fact. The ancients’ imaginative theories assisted in their successor’s wonder and addition to impermanent systems. With this perspective, I plan to enroll in more science courses. If progress depends on imagination and materialism, science education should embolden the intuition and potential of each to see within “Worlds of Thought” to collaborate and contribute to knowledge.

In the depths of fall term finals, having completed a series of arduous exams, one student was exhausted. The only thing between her and winter break was a timed exam for a General Education class that she was taking pass-fail. Drained, anxious and feeling “like a deflated balloon,” she started the clock. The exam consisted of two short essays. By the time she finished the first one, she had nothing left to give. To pass the class, all she needed was to turn in something for the second essay. She had an idea.
Before finals started, her friends had told her about ChatGPT, OpenAI’s free new chatbot which uses machine learning to respond to prompts in fluent natural language and code. She had yet to try it for herself. With low expectations, she made an account on OpenAI’s website and typed in the prompt for her essay. The quality of the results pleasantly surprised her. With some revision, she turned ChatGPT’s sentences into her essay. Feeling guilty but relieved, she submitted it: Finally, she was done with the semester.
This student and others in this article were granted anonymity by The Crimson to discuss potential violations of Harvard’s Honor Code and other policies out of concerns for disciplinary action.
Since its Nov. 30, 2022 release, ChatGPT has provoked awe and fear among its millions of users. Yet its seeming brilliance distracts from important flaws: It can produce harmful content and often writes fiction as if it were fact.
Because of these limitations and the potential for cheating, many teachers are worried about ChatGPT’s impact on the classroom. Already, the application has been banned by school districts across the country, including those of New York City, Seattle, and Los Angeles.
These fears are not unfounded. At Harvard, ChatGPT quickly found its way onto students’ browsers. In the midst of finals week, we encountered someone whose computer screen was split between two windows: on the left, an open-internet exam for a statistics class, and on the right, ChatGPT outputting answers to his questions. He admitted that he was also bouncing ideas for a philosophy paper off the AI. Another anonymous source we talked to used the chatbot to complete his open-internet Life Sciences exam.
But at the end of the fall term, Harvard had no official policy prohibiting the use of ChatGPT. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, in a December interview with The Crimson, did not view ChatGPT as representing a new threat to education: “There have always been shortcuts,” he said. “We leave decisions around pedagogy and assignments and evaluation up to the faculty.”
On Jan. 20, Acting Dean of Undergraduate Education Anne Harrington sent an email to Harvard educators acknowledging that ChatGPT’s abilities have “raised questions for all of us.”
In her message, Harrington relayed guidance from the Office of Undergraduate Education. At first glance, the language seemed to broadly prohibit the use of AI tools for classwork, warning students that Harvard’s Honor Code “forbids students to represent work as their own that they did not write, code, or create,” and that “Submission of computer-generated text without attribution is also prohibited by ChatGPT’s own terms of service.”
But, the email also specified that instructors could “use or adapt” the guidance as they saw fit, allowing them substantial flexibility. The guidance did not clarify how to view the work of students who acknowledge their use of ChatGPT. Nor did it mention whether students can enlist ChatGPT to give them feedback or otherwise supplement their learning.
Some students are already making the most of this gray area. One student we talked to says that he uses ChatGPT to explain difficult mathematical concepts, adding that ChatGPT explains them better than his teaching fellow.
Natalia I. Pazos ’24 uses the chatbot as a kind of interactive SparkNotes. After looking through the introduction and conclusion of a dense Gen Ed reading herself, she asks ChatGPT to give her a summary. “I don’t really have to read the full article, and I feel like it gives me sometimes a better overview,” she says.
Professors are already grappling with whether to ban ChatGPT or let students use it. But beyond this semester, larger questions loom. Will AI simply become another tool in every cheater’s arsenal, or will it radically change what it means to learn?
Put yourself in our place: It’s one of those busy Saturdays where you have too much to do and too little time to do it, and you set about writing a short essay for History 1610: “East Asian Environments.” The task is to write about the impact of the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent nuclear meltdown in Japan. In a database, you encounter an image of a frozen clock in a destroyed school. Two precious hours pass as you research the school, learning about the ill-prepared evacuation plans and administrative failures that led to 74 children’s deaths. As you type up a draft, your fingers feel tense. It’s a harrowing image — you can’t stop envisioning this clock ticking down the moments until disaster. After spending six hours reading and writing, you finally turn the piece in.
But what if the assignment didn’t have to take so much time? We tried using ChatGPT to write this class essay (which, to be clear, was already turned in). After a minute or two refining our prompts, we ended up with a full essay, which began with:
Ticking away the moments of a typical school day, the clock on the wall of Okawa Elementary School suddenly froze on March 11, 2011, as the world around it was shattered by a massive earthquake and tsunami. The clock, once a symbol of the passage of time, now stood as a haunting reminder of the tragedy that had struck the school.
In less than five minutes, ChatGPT did what originally took six hours. And it did it well enough.
Condensing hours into minutes is no small feat, and an enticing prospect for many. Students have many different demands on their time, and not everyone puts academics first. Some pour their time into intense extracurriculars, pre-professional goals, or jobs. (People also want to party.)
Yet the principle underlying a liberal arts curriculum — one that’s enshrined in Harvard’s mission — is the value of intellectual transformation. Transforming yourself is necessarily difficult. Learning the principles of quantum mechanics or understanding what societies looked like before the Industrial Revolution requires deconstructing your worldview and building it anew. Harvard’s honor code, then, represents not just a moral standard but also an expectation that students go through that arduous process.
That’s the theory. In practice, many students feel they don’t always have the time to do the difficult work of intellectual transformation. But they still care about their grades, so they cut corners. And now, just a few clicks away, there’s ChatGPT: a tool so interactive it practically feels like it’s your own work.
So, can professors stop students from using ChatGPT? And should they?
This semester, many instructors at Harvard prohibited students from using ChatGPT, treating it like any other form of academic dishonesty. Explicit bans on ChatGPT became widespread, greeting students on syllabi for classes across departments, from Philosophy to Neuroscience.
Some instructors, like professor Catherine A. Brekus ’85, who teaches Religion 120: “Religion and Nationalism in the United States: A History,” directly imported the Office of Undergraduate Education’s suggested guidance onto their syllabus. Others, like Spanish 11, simply told students not to use it in an introductory lecture. The syllabus for Physical Sciences 12a went so far as to discourage use of the tool with multiple verses of a song written by ChatGPT:
I’m just a tool, a way to find some answers
But I can’t do the work for you, I’m not a dancer
You gotta put in the effort, put in the time
Don’t rely on me, that’s a crime
Making these professors’ lives difficult is that, at the moment, there is no reliable way to detect whether a student’s work is AI-generated. In late January, OpenAI released a classifier to distinguish between AI and human-written text, but it only correctly identified AI-written text 26 percent of the time. GPTZero, a classifier launched in January by Princeton undergraduate Edward Tian, now claims to correctly identify human-written documents 99 percent of the time and AI-written documents 85 percent of the time.
Still, a high likelihood of AI involvement in an assignment may not be enough evidence to bring a student before the Honor Council. Out of more than a dozen professors we’ve spoken with, none currently plan to use an AI detector.
Not all instructors plan to ban ChatGPT at all. Incoming assistant professor of Computer Science Jonathan Frankle questions whether students in advanced computer science classes should be forced to use older, more time-consuming tools if they’ve already mastered the basics of coding.
“It would be a little bit weird if we said, you know, in CS 50, go use punch cards, you’re not allowed to use any modern tools,” he says, referring to the tool used by early computer scientists to write programs.
Harvard Medical School professor Gabriel Kreiman feels similarly. In his courses, students are welcome to use ChatGPT, whether for writing their code or their final reports. His only stipulation is that students inform him when they’ve used the application and understand that they’re still responsible for the work. “If it’s wrong,” he says, “you get the grade, not ChatGPT.”
Kumaresh Krishnan, a teaching fellow for Gen Ed 1125: “Artificial & Natural Intelligence,” believes that if the class isn’t focused on how to code or write, then ChatGPT use is justified under most circumstances. Though he is not responsible for the academic integrity policy of the course, Krishnan believes that producing a nuanced, articulate answer with ChatGPT requires students to understand key concepts.
“If you’re using ChatGPT that well, maybe you don’t understand all the math behind it, maybe you don’t understand all the specifics — but you're understanding the game enough to manipulate it,” he says. “And that itself, that’s a win.”
The student that used ChatGPT for an open-internet life sciences exam last semester says he had mastered the concepts but just couldn’t write fast enough. ChatGPT, he says, only “fleshed out” his answers. He received one of the highest grades in the class.
While most of the teachers we spoke with prohibit the use of ChatGPT, not everyone has ruled out using it in the future. Harvard College Fellow William J. Stewart, in his course German 192: “Artificial Intelligences: Body, Art, and Technology in Modern Germany,” explicitly forbids the use of ChatGPT. But for him, the jury is still out on ChatGPT’s pedagogical value: “Do I think it has a place in the classroom? Maybe?”
“There are two aspects that we need to think about,” says Soroush Saghafian when asked about ChatGPT. “One is that, can we ban it? Second, should we ban it?” To Saghafian, an associate professor of public policy at the Kennedy School who is teaching a course on machine learning and big data analytics, the answer to both questions is no. In his view, people will always find ways around prohibitive measures. “It’s like trying to ban use of the internet,” he says.
Most educators at Harvard who we spoke with don’t share the sense of panic that permeates the headlines. Operating under the same assumption as Saghafian — that it is impossible to prevent students from using ChatGPT — educators have adopted diverse strategies to adapt their curricula.
In some language classes, for example, threats posed by intelligent technology are nothing new. “Ever since the internet, really, there have been increasingly large numbers of things that students can use to do their work for them,” says Amanda Gann, an instructor for French 50: “Advanced French II: Justice, Equity, Rights, and Language.”
Even before the rise of large language models like ChatGPT, French 50 used measures to limit students’ ability to use tools like Google Translate for assignments. “The first drafts of all of their major assessments are done in class,” Gann says.
Still, Gann and the other instructors made additional changes this semester in response to the release of ChatGPT. After writing first drafts in class, French 50 students last semester revised their papers at home. This spring, students will instead transform their draft composition into a conversational video. To ensure that students don’t write their remarks beforehand — or have ChatGPT write them — the assignment will be graded on how “spontaneous and like fluid conversation” their speech is.
Instructors were already considering an increased emphasis on oral assessments, Gann says, but she might not have implemented it without the pressure of ChatGPT.
Gann welcomes the change. She views emergence of large language models like ChatGPT as a “pedagogical challenge.” This applies both to making her assignments less susceptible to AI — “Is this something only a human could do?” — as well as reducing the incentive to use AI in the first place. In stark contrast to the projected panic about ChatGPT, Gann thinks the questions it has posed to her as an educator “make it kind of fun.”
Stewart thinks that ChatGPT will provide “a moment to reflect from the educator’s side.” If ChatGPT can do their assignments, perhaps their assignments are “uninspired, or they’re kind of boring, or they’re asking students to be repetitive,” he says.
Stewart also trusts that his students see the value in learning without cutting corners. In his view, very few of the students in his high-level German translation class would “think that it’s a good use of their time to take that class and then turn to the translating tool,” he says. “The reason they’re taking that class is because they also understand that there’s a way to get a similar toolbox in their own brain.” To Stewart, students must see that developing that toolbox for themselves is “far more powerful and far more useful” than copying text into Google Translate.
Computer Science professor Boaz Barak shares Stewart’s sentiment: “Generally, I trust students. I personally don't go super out of my way to try to detect student cheating,” he says. “And I am not going to start.”
Frankle, too, won’t be going out of his way to detect whether his students are cheating — instead, he assumes that students in his CS classes will be using tools like ChatGPT. Accordingly, he intends to make his assignments and exams significantly more demanding. In previous courses, Frankle says he might have asked students to code a simple neural network. With the arrival of language models that can code, he’ll ask that his students reproduce a much more complex version inspired by cutting-edge research. “Now you can get more accomplished, so I can ask more of you,” he says.
Other courses may soon follow suit. Just last week, the instructor for CS 181: “Machine Learning,” offered students extra credit if they used ChatGPT as an “educational aid” to support them in actions like debugging code.
Educators across disciplines are encouraging students to critically engage with ChatGPT in their classes.
Harvard College Fellow Maria Dikcis, who teaches English 195BD: “The Dark Side of Big Data,” assigned students a threefold exercise — first write a short analytical essay, then ask ChatGPT to produce a paper on the same topic, and finally compare their work and ChatGPT’s. “I sort of envisioned it as a human versus machine intelligence,” she says. She hopes the assignment will force students to reflect on the seeming brilliance of the model but also to ask, in her words, “What are its shortcomings, and why is that important?”
Saghafian also thinks it is imperative that students interact with this technology, both to understand its uses as well as to see its “cracks.” In the 2000s, teachers helped students learn the benefits and pitfalls of internet resources like Google search. Saghafian recommends that educators use a similar approach with ChatGPT.
And these cracks can be easy to miss. When she first started using ChatGPT to summarize her readings, Pazos recalls feeling “really impressed by how fast it happened.” To her, because ChatGPT displays its responses word by word, “it feels like it’s thinking.”
“One of the hypes about this technology is that people think, oh, it can do everything, it can think, it can reason,” Saghafian says. Through critical engagement with ChatGPT, students can learn that “none of those is correct.” Large language models, he explains, “don't have the ability to think.” Their writing process, in fact, can show students the difference between reasoning and outputting language.
In the Okawa elementary school essay written by ChatGPT, one of the later paragraphs stated: The surviving students and teachers were quickly evacuated to safety.
In fact, the students and teachers were not evacuated to safety. They were evacuated toward the tsunami — which was exactly why Okawa Elementary School became such a tragedy. ChatGPT could describe the tragedy, but since it did not understand what made it a tragedy, it spat out a fundamental falsehood with confidence.
This behavior is not out of the ordinary. ChatGPT consistently makes factual errors, even though OpenAI designed it not to and has repeatedly updated it. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Despite impressive capabilities, ChatGPT and other large language models come with fundamental limitations and potential for harm.
Many of these flaws are baked into the way ChatGPT works. ChatGPT is an example of what researchers call a large language model. LLMs work primarily by processing huge amounts of data. This is called training, and in ChatGPT’s case, the training likely involved processing most of the text on the internet — an ocean of niche Wikipedia articles, angry YouTube comment threads, poorly written Harry Potter fan fiction, recipes for lemon poppy seed muffins, and everything in between.
Through that ocean of training data, LLMs become adept at recognizing and reproducing the complex statistical relationships between words in natural language. For ChatGPT, this might mean learning what types of words appear in a Wikipedia article as opposed to a chapter of fanfiction, or what lists of ingredients are most likely to follow the title “pistachio muffins.” So, when ChatGPT is given a prompt, like “how do I bake pistachio muffins,” it uses the statistical relationships it has learned to predict the most likely response to that prompt.
Occasionally, this means regurgitating material from its training set (like copying a muffin recipe) or adapting a specific source to the prompt (like summarizing a Wikipedia article). But more often, ChatGPT synthesizes its responses from the correlations it has learned between words. This synthesis is what gives it the uncanny yet hilarious ability to write the opening of George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” in the style of a SpongeBob episode, or explain the code for a Python program in the voice of a wiseguy from a 1940s gangster movie.
This explains the propensity of LLMs to produce false claims even when asked about real events. The algorithms behind ChatGPT have no conception of truth — only of correlations between words. Moreover, the distinction between truth and falsehood on the written internet is rarely clear from the words alone.
Take the Okawa Elementary School example. If you read a blog post about the effects of a disastrous earthquake on an elementary school, how would you determine whether it was true? You might consider the plausibility of the story, the reputability of the writer, or whether corroborating evidence, like photographs or external links, were available. Your decision, in other words, would not depend solely on the text of the post. Instead, it would be informed by digital literacy, fact-checking, and your knowledge of the outside world. Language models have none of that.
The difference between fact and fiction is not the only elementary concept left out of ChatGPT’s algorithm. Despite its ability to predict and reproduce complex patterns of writing, ChatGPT often cannot parse comparatively simple logic. The technology will output confident-sounding incorrect answers when asked to solve short word problems, add two large numbers, or write a sentence ending with the letter “c.” Questioning its answer to a math problem may lead it to admit a mistake, even if there wasn’t one. Given the list of words: “ChatGPT” “has” “endless” “limitations,” it told us that the third-to-last-word on that list was: “ChatGPT.” (Narcissistic much?)
When James C. Glaser ’25 asked ChatGPT to compose a sestina — a poetic form with six-line stanzas and other constraints — the program outputted stanzas with four lines, no matter how explicit he made the prompt. At some point during the back-and-forth, he says, “I just sort of gave up and realized that it was kind of ridiculous.”
Lack of sufficient training data in certain areas can also affect ChatGPT’s performance. Multiple faculty members who teach languages other than English told us ChatGPT performed noticeably worse in those languages.
The content of the training data also matters. The abundance of bias and hateful language on the internet filters into the written output of LLMs, as leading AI ethics researchers such as Timnit Gebru have shown. In English language data, “white supremacist and misogynistic, ageist, etc., views are overrepresented,” a 2021 study co-authored by Gebru found, “setting up models trained on these datasets to further amplify biases and harms.”
Indeed, OpenAI’s GPT-3, a predecessor of ChatGPT that powers hundreds of applications today, is quick to output paragraphs with racist, sexist, anti-semitic, or otherwise harmful messages if prompted, as the MIT Technology Review and others have shown.
Because OpenAI has invested heavily in making these outputs harder to reproduce for ChatGPT, ChatGPT will often refuse to answer prompts deemed dangerous or harmful. These barriers, however, are easily sidestepped, leading some to point out that AI technology could be used to manufacture fake news and hateful, extremist content.
In order to reduce the likelihood of such outputs, OpenAI feeds explicitly labeled examples of harmful content into its LLMs. This might be effective, but it also requires humans to label thousands of examples, often by reading through nightmarish material to decide whether it qualifies as harmful.
As many other AI companies have done, OpenAI reportedly chose to outsource this essential labor. In January, Time reported that OpenAI had contracted out the labeling of harmful content to Kenyan workers paid less than $2 per hour. Multiple workers recalled encountering horrifying material in their work, Time reported.
“Classifying and filtering harmful [text and images] is a necessary step in minimizing the amount of violent and sexual content included in training data and creating tools that can detect harmful content,” an OpenAI spokesperson told Time.
Even with the viral popularity of ChatGPT and a new $10 billion investment from Microsoft, legal issues loom over OpenAI. If, in some sense, large language models merely synthesize text from across the internet, does that mean they are stealing copyrighted material?
Some argue that OpenAI’s so-called breakthrough might be illegal. A class action lawsuit filed just weeks before the release of ChatGPT alleges that OpenAI’s Codex, a language model optimized for writing code, violated the licenses of thousands of software developers whose code was used to train the model.
This lawsuit could open the gates for similar proceedings against other language models. Many believe that OpenAI and other tech giants train AI systems using massive datasets indiscriminately pulled from the internet, meaning that large language models might be stealing or repurposing copyrighted and potentially private material that appears in their datasets without licensing or attribution.
If OpenAI could be sued for Codex, the same logic would likely apply to ChatGPT. In the past year, OpenAI doubled the size of their legal team. “This might be the first case,” said Matthew Butterick, one of the attorneys representing the software developers, in an interview with Bloomberg Law, “but it will not be the last.”
OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.
As ChatGPT and LLMs grow more popular, the question of what to do about these flaws only becomes more pressing.
When you’re watching a disembodied green icon spit out line after line of articulate, seemingly original content, it’s hard not to feel like you’re living in the future. It’s also hard not to worry that this technology’s capabilities will render your education obsolete.
So will ChatGPT transform learning as much as the hype would have us believe?
It’s undeniable that ChatGPT and other LLMs — through their ability to generate readable paragraphs and functioning programs — are revolutionary technology. But in their own way, so were calculators, the internet, Google search, Wikipedia, and Google Translate.
Every professor we talked to cited at least one of these tools as having catalyzed a similar paradigm shift within education. German and Comparative Literature professor John T. Hamilton likens ChatGPT to an “interactive Wikipedia.” Saghafian, the HKS professor, views it as playing a similar role to Google.
People have been adapting to these technologies for decades. Children growing up in the 2000s and 2010s were told, “Don’t trust everything you see on the internet.” Gradually, they became digitally literate. They saw the value, for example, in using Wikipedia as a starting point for research, but knew never to cite it.
Like Google and Wikipedia in their earliest stages, people are currently using ChatGPT to cut corners. But as experts highlight its flaws, teachers are beginning to promote a kind of AI literacy. (This would prove essential if an LLM professes its love for you or says it will hack you, as the AI-powered Bing Chat did to Kevin Roose in his New York Times article.)
To Barak, the computer science professor, a liberal arts education can help prepare students for an uncertain future. “The main thing we are trying to teach students is tools for thinking and for adapting,” Barak says. “Not just for the jobs that exist today, but also for the jobs that will exist in 10 years.”
While ChatGPT currently can’t follow simple logic, tell true from false, or write complex, coherent arguments, what about in a year? A decade? The amount of computing power devoted to training and deploying machine learning applications has grown exponentially over the past few years. In 2018, OpenAI’s state-of-the-art GPT-1 model had 100 million parameters. By 2020, the number of parameters in GPT-3 had grown to 175 billion. With this pace of change, what new abilities might GPT-4 — OpenAI’s rumored next language model — have? And how will universities, not to mention society as a whole, adapt to this emerging technology?
Some instructors are already imagining future uses for AI that could benefit students and teachers alike.
“What I’d love to see is, for example, someone to make a French language chatbot that I could tell my students to talk to,” Gann, the French instructor, says. She says an app that could give students feedback on their accent or pronunciation would also be useful. Such technology, she explains, would allow students to improve their skills without the expensive attention of a teacher.
Saghafian believes that ChatGPT could act as “a sort of free colleague” that students could talk to.
Silicon Valley researchers and machine learning professors don’t know where the field is heading, but they are convinced that it’ll be big.
“I do believe there is going to be an AI revolution,” says Barak. In his view, AI-based tools will not make humans redundant, but rather change the nature of jobs on the scale of the industrial revolution.
As such, it’s impossible to predict exactly what the AI-powered future will look like. It would be as difficult as trying to predict what the internet would look like “in 1993,” says Frankle, the incoming CS professor.
Underlying these claims — and the perspectives of many professors we talked to — is an assumption that the cat is out of the bag, that AI’s future has already been set in motion and efforts to shape it will be futile.
Not everyone makes this assumption. In fact, some believe that shaping AI’s future is not only possible, but vital. “What’s needed is not something out of science fiction — it’s regulation, empowerment of ordinary people and empowerment of workers,” wrote University of Washington professor Emily M. Bender in a 2022 blog post.
Thus far, the AI industry has faced little regulation.
However, some fear any form of constraint could stifle progress. When asked for specific ideas about regulating AI, Saghafian, the public policy professor, muses that he wouldn’t want policymakers “to be too worried about the negative sides of these technologies, so that they end up blocking the future, positive side of it.”
In a regulation-free environment, Silicon Valley companies may not prioritize ethics or public knowledge. Frankle, who currently builds language models like ChatGPT as the chief scientist for an AI startup called MosaicML, explains how at startups, the incentive is not “to publish and share knowledge” — that’s a side bonus — but rather, “to build an awesome product.”
Hamilton, however, urges caution. Technology empowers us to live as easily and conveniently as possible, he explains, to live without limits: we can fly across the world, read any language just by pointing our smartphones at it, or learn any fact by tapping a few words into Google.
But limits, Hamilton says, are ultimately what allow us to ascribe meaning within our lives. We wouldn’t care about gold if it was plentiful, he points out, and accordingly, we wouldn’t care much about living if we lived forever. “We care because we’re so limited,” Hamilton says. “A life without limits is ultimately a life without value.”
As we continue to create more powerful technology, we may not only lose sight of our own limits, but also become dependent on our creations.
For instance, students might be tempted to rely on ChatGPT’s outputs for critical thinking. “That’s great,” Hamilton says. “But am I losing my ability to do precisely that for myself?”
We think back to the Okawa Elementary School essay. ChatGPT’s version wasn’t just worse than the student-written one because it repeated cliched phrases, lacked variation in its sentence structure, or concluded by saying “in conclusion.”
ChatGPT’s draft was worse because ChatGPT did not understand why what transpired at Okawa Elementary School was a tragedy. It did not spend hours imagining such an unfathomable chain of events. It did not feel the frustration of its initial expressions falling short, nor did it painstakingly revise its prose to try to do it justice.
ChatGPT didn’t feel satisfied when, after such a process, it had produced a work approaching what it wanted. It did not feel fundamentally altered by its engagement with the cruel randomness of human suffering. It did not leave the assignment with a renewed gratitude for life.
ChatGPT, in other words, did not go through the human process of learning.
If we asked ChatGPT to write us a longform article about ChatGPT and the future of education, would it be worth reading? Would you learn anything?

March and April are missing.
My mother and I scour over the details of the sepia prints, looking for any hints of my chronology. In one picture, I’m a chubby toddler throwing snow into the air, red firecrackers partially visible in the background.
“It’s probably around mid-February, after the Lunar New Year,” my mother tells me.
In the next, my hair is considerably shorter, preparation for a sweltering summer in Zhejiang.
“Let’s call it late May? It’s 2003, since we sent those white shoes earlier that year after you outgrew the red ones,” she says.
From sometime in May 2001 to what I think is Jan. 8, 2004, I don’t have any sense of a personal timeline, let alone a sense of self. For the two and a half years that I lived with my grandmother in China, an ocean away from my parents, I have but 100 Kodak technicolor prints — shipped in quarterly installments from across the Pacific — to show. Only a few have a date jotted on the back.
There’s almost nothing left that can connect me to those years. Many of the buildings I once roamed around have since been demolished and rebuilt; earlier this year, the authorities tore down my grandmother’s generational home. And after spending my adolescence in a different country, the people in the photos are but strangers; some have reunited with our ancestors, while others no longer keep in touch, now nameless faces in a country of a billion faces.
In the grand scheme of the universe, specific dates are hardly the end of the world. But as I flipped through old photos for hours with my mother to piece together my childhood, I realized that I had already lost the concrete attachments to my childhood — the whos, the whats, and the wheres. But without a when, my childhood became fully disembodied, somewhere in space, somewhere in time.
***
After high school, I once again jetted halfway across the world, this time across the Atlantic, this time completely alone.
Four years of high school had completely burnt me out. Countless late nights, early mornings, and nonstop pressure had sucked the joy out of learning. As excited as I was about Harvard, I was also terrified of falling into the same self-destructive tendencies that had fueled my high school success. After stumbling upon a fully-funded exchange program in Germany, I decided that I would be better off exploring at my own pace for a year before stepping foot in Cambridge.
That was the reason I told my friends, and ultimately the one that convinced my parents. But beneath it all, another desire laid nascent — that of reinventing myself, of reclaiming agency in as many ways as I could. Years before “Emily in Paris” hit Netflix and travel influencers took the world by storm, I was inspired by the Instagram accounts of young people traveling the world on a shoestring budget, many of whom were exchange students on programs similar to mine.
You can be whoever you want in a country where no one knows you, they would say.
In many ways, I did get the experience that I was promised. I navigated everyday life in an unfamiliar country, in a language that I barely had command of. I tested my liver. I jetted around Europe, often alone, with my destinations dictated by Ryanair’s cheapest fares. I had my first heartbreak. I went to my first queer club. I fell in love with Berlin, the city of chasing radical authenticity.
But the sound I remember the most from my time abroad isn’t the jargon of foreign languages, the unrelenting bass at clubs, or the buzz of old-town streets — it’s the slightly sticky shutter click of the beginner Nikon kit that my parents had gifted me before my departure.
I was almost never without it. In no small part, I wanted to announce my place in the world, to show my friends back home photos proving that I was in the midst of an adventure. But more than that, I was motivated by the fear of forgetting. My time abroad had an expiration date — I wanted to capture every single detail of my newfound experiences and trap them in 28-megabyte snapshots. My camera affirmed my existence: Here I was, and here was indisputable proof that I was here.
Over the course of a year, I amassed 20,000 photos. I haven’t touched them since.
***
Early last year, I picked up a film camera. My mother laughed.
“Why would you return to the junk we used when you were a baby?” she asked me.
The truth was that I was drowning in memories.
On March 10, 2020 — hardly nine months after I had returned to America and just two months into my second semester of college — President Bacow sent out an email to all Harvard students, announcing that we would need to return home within five days due to Covid-19.
My friends and I pretended that it was the end of the world. We cleared out the inventory at cafes on campus, skipped class to venture out to Walden Pond, and stayed up all night to talk about the apocalypse.
On our last day on campus, we woke up at 5 a.m. to watch the sunrise over Weeks Bridge.
The entire time, I snapped portraits of my friends — the solemness on Matej’s face before he departed for his flight back to Slovakia, unsure when he’d be back in the United States; the tight embrace between Delaney and graduating seniors, who would venture into an unknown world; the remnants of the debate team, huddling under a blanket at dawn.
But at home, in lockdown and with all the time in the world to think, I realized that I had been documenting too much and feeling too little. As I scrolled through the pictures from that week, it registered that even though I was with my friends from dawn to dusk every day, I was really spending my time buried behind the lens of my camera. Now, it was unclear when I would be able to see them again.
Perhaps part of my detachment was a subconscious effort to keep myself from confronting the life-changing reality before me. But looking at the 50,000 photos in my library, it was clear to me that my photography obsession in that week was part of a broader pattern: In my quest to remember, I had forgotten that I needed to first live.
So, once I returned to campus in spring 2021, I went analog. The film advance lever of my vintage Pentax always begins smooth but gradually stiffens up. I adjust the focus on the lens to capture the full depth of field before metering the light. Too much exposure, and the image is fried, but I won’t know until it’s developed two weeks later. All in all, it takes me about a minute or two to take a picture, during which I take in my surroundings — the sounds, the smells, and most importantly, how I feel.
And with 36 shots in a roll, I choose my moments deliberately — and then I put my camera away.
***
This year, I’ve deleted more photos than I’ve taken.
Following my New Year’s resolution, I visit my photo library before I sleep each night, examining the 22 years of photos taken on that day each year. Some moments I easily remember — the time I was bitten by a dog on New Year’s Eve, my first time venturing out of the state for a swim competition at age 13, passing through radiation detectors and into the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
But some buried memories do come rushing back as I look through the archives: a trip to downtown Chicago, an evening cooking with friends, seeing a Gutenberg Bible for the first time. And as I look for these hidden gems, I also notice all the clutter in the way — useless screenshots to document some petty argument, pictures of that painting I promised myself I would Google, three nearly-identical versions of the same food shot. So I purge them.
It’s hard to resist the constant urge to document. But memory is just as much about forgetting as it is about remembering. We need to give ourselves the space to feel the full weight of the moment, because the photo itself is only a negative, an impression, an anchor to return to in moments of nostalgia, in times of need. Our senses must fill in the rest.
These days, I don’t think about those Kodak prints from my childhood much. I don’t blame my relatives for choosing to live outside of the camera’s gaze, only bringing it out for the special moments: the first snowfall, Chinese New Year, awaiting the arrival of summer. And I don’t crave more pictures of my childhood in the first place; the lack of photos doesn’t bother me like it used to.
Rather, I have a renewed belief in the power of my memories. I do not need constant documentation of my existence. Photos may capture part of the scene, but all they are is a gateway, one that unlocks stories, feelings, and moments. Perhaps I may never completely recover my childhood, but that is equally part of what it means to live.

Lined with endless rows of white cabinets, Harvard’s Ornithology Collection is imposing — even mausoleum-like — upon first glance; it’s only after opening the drawers that the true colors of the collection are revealed. Since it was founded in 1859, it has become the fifth-largest ornithological collection on Earth, boasting around 400,000 specimens and 8,300 species — over 85 percent of all known bird species.
Jeremiah Trimble, a curatorial associate and the manager of the collection, helps coordinate the work of anyone seeking to use the collection. “The specimens are used in all kinds of ways. They’re used in anything from artists creating field guides,” he says, “to taking feather samples to look at isotopes to understand diet or environmental contaminants.”

Each specimen affords valuable insight into the history and future of birds. “The specimens provide a snapshot in time about a species and where it occurred,” Trimble says. “People can use them to look at how genetics have changed within a species over time.”
The collection houses a bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae), which is hardly larger than a penny. Weighing in at under two grams, the bee hummingbird is the smallest species of bird on earth and can only be found in Cuba.
Another bird in the collection is the rhinoceros hornbill (Buceros rhinoceros). Native to the forests of Malaysia, Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, this species can be easily identified by its distinctive horn, also known as a casque, used to attract mates and increase the intensity of their calls. However, the casque has also made the bird a target for poachers.
The vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum) may not have an impressive casque like the hornbill, but it makes up for this with its incredible feathers. Decorated with countless white speckles and an electric blue collar, this ground-dwelling species is a standout in the savannas of northeastern Africa. Social by nature, the vulturine guineafowl can be observed in small- to medium-sized flocks as it searches the parched scrub for invertebrates and seeds.
Driven by sexual selection and geographic isolation, the king birds-of-paradise (Cicinnurus regius) are some of the flashiest birds in the sky. Come mating season, the male birds sway side to side, holding up their iridescent disk-shaped tail feathers to seduce females.
Similarly, the tail feathers of the Wilson’s bird-of-paradise (Cicinnurus respublica) have evolved into delicate spirals in order to help attract mates. These bright plumes help cut through the darkness of the shadowy forest floor where these birds reside.
The collection features one of the few remaining specimens of the now-extinct black mamo (Drepanis funerea). These birds used to live on the island of Molokai; however, invasive species destroyed the black mamo’s natural habitat and preyed upon their young. The last black mamo was collected in 1907. Though Harvard’s Ornithology Collection may be filled with beautiful displays, it also serves as a poignant reminder of the way humans have impacted the environment and those living in it.

Sometimes, it seems like all eyes are on Anna Delvey.
The 32-year-old would-be art philanthropist — whose legal name is Anna Sorokin, though she still goes by the pseudonym of Delvey — was arrested and later convicted in 2019 of stealing more than $200,000 from banks, hotels, and restaurants. Since then, she has been the subject of two magazine exposes, lampooned on Saturday Night Live, dramatized in Netflix’s “Inventing Anna,” and interviewed by countless media outlets — all seeking to understand the story of her fraud and deception of New York’s art and fashion elite.
The fixation has extended to Harvard’s campus, where Delvey’s story has been studied in at least four classes; depending on who you ask, she’s a deft con woman, a study in performance, a self-taught mimic of the upper class. Most recently, at the Harvard Business School, she took questions via Zoom last week from students in the course HBS 1377: “Borderline,” a class taught by professor Eugene F. Soltes ’04 on white-collar crime and the “murky side of the business world.”
Everybody wants to make sense of the Anna Delvey phenomenon — everybody, it seems, except for Anna Delvey.
“It feels like people kind of assign too much meaning,” Delvey says in an interview. “They just project a lot.”
“It was never that deep,” she adds.
Delvey is speaking to us over Zoom from an apartment in New York City’s East Village, where she is on house arrest as she fights deportation for overstaying her visa. Delvey was born in Russia and raised in Germany. As per her publicists’ stipulations, she can interview only through audio: She is a black box on our laptop screen.
However, during her lecture to the HBS class the prior day, which was closed to the media, she appeared on camera wearing a full face of makeup, deliberately lit. She sported a crimson sweatshirt emblazoned with the Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers logo.
Delvey’s behavior suggested a sort of performed indifference, according to multiple HBS students in the class. Delvey, the students say, was aloof and gave short, evasive answers — an evaluation Delvey says is understandable. At one point, she was filing her nails; at another, the students say, she told the class she was bored. A publicist for Delvey later clarifies that she said she finds house arrest boring.
Delvey tells us that she felt the talk was no different than the speaking invitations she gets “all the time.” Nevertheless, she says, she found the reaction on social media to the news of her talk at Harvard “really funny.”
“It’s just another opportunity to see how stupid mainstream media is, and people on Twitter,” she says. “That’s all it is.”
Delvey gets frustrated by people — particularly, the media — trying to rehash her contentious past. They seem to want her to show some sign of remorse, she says, but she’s “not really interested.”
“Even though I’ve said it so many times, over and over, in my prior interviews, people just want to hear you say it to them,” Delvey says. “I’m just saying, regret is looking back and not accepting who you are today. I don’t know. You didn’t get a choice to go back and fix your mistakes.”
“So, what’s the point?” she says. “Just learn from it and move on.”
***
Soltes, the Business School professor, won’t speak about Anna Delvey because he has a longstanding policy to not publicly comment on guests in his course, he says.
But he does have thoughts about white-collar crime more generally; for years, Soltes corresponded with dozens of white-collar offenders, from Bernie Madoff to former staff at Enron. He is open about grappling with the ethics of inviting criminals to Harvard, even in an academic context, without legitimizing their behavior.
Nevertheless, he says the work has given him a “deeper sense of humility” and an intimate understanding of the ethical and legal gray areas of business.
“I think we have a tendency to see the world as very black and white,” he says. “That simple dichotomy of good and bad oversimplifies things.”
“We all tell white lies. Luckily, most of those lies are pretty innocent, or we could say, exaggerations,” Soltes continues. “But obviously, in different contexts, like for example, if you’re raising funding, those exaggerations can actually turn into fraud, and we want to understand those distinctions.”
He finds that white-collar criminals tend to not be remorseful about their crimes. White-collar offenses aren’t necessarily rooted in wishing harm upon others, but rather in seeking success in personal endeavors; the harm registers as “an externality associated with some other goal,” Soltes says. But, Soltes is careful to mention, the harm is still very real.
“The people sitting in a boardroom or sitting in a conference room, the distance between them — both physically, temporally, psychologically — and the ultimate victims are fairly far removed. You’re not having to go up to someone to take their wallet,” Soltes says. “No one that I’ve ever invited to class has been what we call a ‘pickpocket,’ but many of them have actually created dramatically more harm on many more people — in the same way that the world’s most effective pickpocket could — by literally stealing people’s money.”
Soltes says that through his research, he has found the most effective white-collar criminals don’t consider themselves to be criminals at all. He likens this view to someone driving 65 miles per hour in a 55 lane — though technically illegal, the driver would likely never second-guess themself — until they’re pulled over by the cops.
“The best way of being a great fraudster is if you believe the story you’re telling yourself,” Soltes explains. “Because you actually believe what you’re doing is actually justifiable or rational, you’ll be able to rationalize it. You don’t have to trick yourself.”
We ask if this analysis applies to Delvey. Soltes pauses, then laughs.
“I’m going to choose not to answer that one,” he says.
***
Delvey’s return to the public eye has been swift and immediate. She’s taken several interviews with high-profile media outlets, spoke at the Columbia School of Journalism, and says she’s been invited to Oxford and New York Universities. She has an array of new projects she’s working on from house arrest: a podcast, a reality show called “Delvey’s Dinner Club,” a book, and an NFT collection called “Reinventing Anna,” named after the TV show.
She has also ventured into the art world, selling hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of sketches drawn during her stint in prison: “I feel like I was way more creative when I was in jail,” she says.
Nevertheless, she says she wants to move away from the art and entertainment industries, possibly turning toward law or criminal justice reform — inspired by her experience in Rikers Island. When asked if she’d ever consider applying to Harvard, she’s dismissive: “I just don’t feel like it’s the best use of my time. I feel like you can just, like, read a book.”
Despite all the attention — and despite all her new, very publicized projects — Delvey maintains that she doesn’t see herself as capitalizing on her notoriety for fame or money.
“I never asked for any of this,” she says. “I never wanted to be famous.”
“I’m going to be written about regardless,” she adds. All she can do, she says, is tell her own story about how she “flipped it around” without “glorifying” her past.
“I wouldn’t want to be seen as an example, ‘Oh yeah, go commit crimes, or fraud, and be famous,’” she adds. “Hopefully people will take it the right way.”
But the speculation, the media frenzies, the ravenous desire for scandal — these, Delvey says, aren’t going away. The real Anna Sorokin gets subsumed by Anna Delvey, the TV character, whose story will always be grist for the entertainment mill.
“I don’t think people are really interested in what the truth is. I think people just want to be entertained,” she says, calling it the ultimate “purpose” of “news and media.”
“Nobody wants to read about, ‘Oh, maybe Anna is not so crazy. Maybe she’s not such a big criminal.’ Like, nobody cares,” she adds. “Why should people be bothered?”
In the short term, Delvey says, she’s “just trying to get out of house arrest.” We exchange pleasantries, and moments later, the Zoom black box — and the real Anna — disappear.

After decades of collecting dust in a Harvard Museum of Natural History classroom, a life-size papier-mâché model of an octopus has found a new home. With each of its looping tentacles stretching out about eight feet, it lies suspended above a grand staircase in the spacious, modern, glassy foyer of Harvard’s Northwest Building, home to labs, classrooms, and offices for Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The model of the Pacific octopus, known as the Enteroctopus dofleini, has been in Harvard’s hands for the last 140 years. In the early 1880s, scientific artist and illustrator James H. Emerton created this object and one other with guidance from a zoologist from Yale and a modeler from the Smithsonian. The other object deteriorated completely after 90 years on display and in the care of Yale. Emerton never saw the animal in person, instead leaning on scientific literature and one scientist’s testimony about its size.
Harvard’s octopus was first displayed in a Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology gallery before being moved into a classroom in the Museum of Natural History, where it remained hidden from the general public and began to deteriorate.
“I went to multiple meetings in this classroom, and it was just kind of there, and we got used to it,” says Sylvie Laborde, a Senior Designer and Acting Exhibition Director for the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture.
But after a series of conversations and initial measurements, the octopus’ second life began as Terry Chase, an expert in the design of natural history exhibits, led a painstaking, careful restoration process. In a room in the basement of the Northwest Building, the restoration team repaired cracks and rebuilt the tips of the arms.
“From a conservation perspective, the MCZ was very interested in restoring the object with the same materials that were used to build it originally,” Laborde says. Preservation of the octopus’ historic and artistic value, rather than precise scientific accuracy, guided the team’s effort.
This made for a harder restoration process, Laborde explains, as the team needed to work with papier-mâché instead of more modern model-making materials like epoxy, a type of resin. They also tested out a variety of painting techniques, trying to match the octopus’ original color and texture.
The team ultimately hoisted the octopus up using an elaborate cable system, and the eight-armed artifact now hangs above the staircase, which guides passers by into a cavernous basement.
“Having it at Northwest kind of gives it a second life,” Laborde says.
The octopus hangs next to two other creatures: the skeletons of a northern bottlenose whale and an orca, which were collected in the 1880s and ultimately acquired by Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology. The skeletons spent nearly 80 years in the attic of the MCZ mammalogy department before their restoration and relocation to the space above Northwest’s main staircase in 2009, just a year after the building’s construction.
Other preserved sea creatures dot Harvard’s campus, including delicate and detailed glass models of jellyfish, anemone, sea slugs, and other invertebrates housed in the MCZ, which restored those models over an eight-year period.
The MCZ expected to find about 60 models in their collections. Instead, they found 430 invertebrates across a variety of Harvard departments, with disparate pieces sometimes stored away in envelopes and boxes.
The glass sea creatures, created by artists Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, are predecessors of Harvard’s “Glass Flowers,” a collection of 4,300 glass botanical models originally used to help undergraduates study.
“The nature of their restoration was based on the fact that they are beautiful objects,” Laborde says of the glass invertebrates exhibit. “They may not carry the same scientific value today as the day they were created, but the craftsmanship and the beauty of the object make it become a different value.”
Harvard students pass by their own sea creature display whenever they walk by the Northwest Building stairs. This constant stream of visitors can engage with the whale skeletons and, now, the octopus model — a possibility that went unrealized when the objects were stashed away in hidden corners of campus.
“I think appreciation may come with having a little knowledge about the history of an object. Decoration might mean it’s nice to look at, but there’s nothing really beyond that,” says Breda M. Zimkus, the director of collections operations at MCZ. “Appreciating something means you can make a connection in some sort of way.”
The octopus is currently accompanied by a small graphic panel entitled “An Ocean Giant” that supplies curious students with a brief history of the octopus. The MZC and HMSC are also hoping to add lights to the octopus, which would illuminate it in the Northwest Building at night.
“I do think people may pass by and miss it,” Laborde says. “People will get used to it. But the beauty of where it is now is that new students come every year.”

When we ask painting conservator Kate Smith to show us how she cleans a painting, she does not lead us to her high-tech X-ray or even to the collection of paintbrushes and tin of acrylics laying on a nearby table. Instead, with the dexterity of having done it 100 times before, Smith grabs a pinch of cotton from a box and wraps it around a skewer to form a swab.
Then, she does the completely unexpected: sticks the swab in her mouth like a lollipop, pulls it out, and begins to rub the damp cotton across the surface of the painting laid before us, a work by pioneering Black portraitist, Barkley L. Hendricks: “October’s Gone… Goodnight.”
The swab-in-mouth technique is a common tool of the trade, Smith assures us, enabling art conservators to collect varnish samples for chemical analysis to determine how best to dissolve the yellow varnish that has accumulated over Hendricks’ work, for instance.
Her intimate proximity to paintings differs from the plebeian museum goer’s protocol: don’t-touch-don’t-blink-don’t-breathe-that-looks-expensive. For Smith, getting up close and personal with the artwork is necessary to conserve a piece while staying true to the artist’s original artistic vision.
When possible, Smith and her team are vigilant about capturing the intentions behind the work in their collections straight from the living artists themselves.
“We interview them about their materials and techniques, their ideas about how art degrades over time, and how they would want that to be interfered with or not,” she explains.
Smith interviewed Hendricks on “October’s Gone…Goodnight” just two weeks before his death, documenting the nuances embedded in his work.
“This is actually acrylic paint with titanium pigment,” she says, pointing to one area of the painting, “and this is oil paint with zinc pigments,” pointing to another. “He was making these really subtle tweaks in his palette to get these subtle changes.”
“October’s Gone… Goodnight” will be sent on loan with other Hendricks portraits to the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, where it will be placed in critical dialogue with European portraiture. For Smith and her team, the upcoming event heightens the importance of maintaining fidelity to Hendricks' vision.
“He isn’t with us any longer, which is a shame because I think he would love to see that show,” Smith says. “That’s why this to me is so powerful. I want to do right by him now.”
But, Smith admits that the conservation process is seldom perfect. “It’s statistically impossible to be in this close proximity to a collection and not eventually make a mistake,” she says.
Smith shares an example of a slip up in her preparation of “Negro Soldier,” a painting that was set to be displayed in the grand opening of the Harvard Art Museum’s new building. “It was looking amazing, and I was so excited,” she says.
Typically, Smith is very organized and analytical with her work — “I’m very Capricorn,” she says. This time, however, Smith had forgotten to test her cleaning solution. “I got to the part of his uniform and I etched into the paint, I rolled it, and part of my swab took some of the paint off,” she says.
Smith winces, like she’s living out her mistake all over again. “I just wanted to die, because no one had ever restored the painting,” she says. “I was the first one to touch it, and I had done this thing.”
After the mistake, Smith tested out a new cleaning solution, then repaired the damaged uniform with a tiny in-painting — a small reconstruction of the missing or damaged part in the painting. Smith hasn’t made a mistake like that since, she tells us: “Maybe that bought me another decade of not making any mistakes, because I’ll never forget that feeling.”
When we walk past “Negro Soldier” on our way out of the gallery, it is impossible to tell that anything happened to it.
Within the world of art conservation, talking about restoration failures can feel taboo. But Smith’s experience with “Negro Soldier” convinced her that sharing mistakes can offer conservators a valuable opportunity to learn from one another. “Everybody has a story,” she says. “And if we don’t talk about it, people will continue to hide it.”
As a conservator, Smith often grapples with the ethics of museum collection curation.
Last August, Smith and three other museum staff workers installed “Funerary Portraits from Roman Egypt: Facing Forward,” a collection of fragmented funerary materials that were once attached to the mummified deceased they depict. The text label invites patrons to “consider the problematic practices that led to the removal of these objects from their original contexts.”
“They’re tough to look at — but they’re beautiful,” says Smith. “That sort of tension, rather than ignore it, talk about it.”
Smith also thinks that, within conservation, there should also be a reckoning about the lack of diversity. Among art conservators, about 65 percent are women and 80 percent of them are white women.
“The people who are doing the work are bringing their understanding to the collections,” Smith says. “A big push in the field is: How do we work with changing who we are? Who’s in these labs doing this work?”
In 2022, the Museum created the Diversity Pre-Program Junior Conservator Fellow, helping to prepare aspiring conservators for the convoluted conservator training application process and ultimately diversify the field. According to Martha Tedeschi, director of the Harvard Art Museums, Smith plays a key role in the fellow’s experience as a “fantastic mentor.” In Tedeschi’s words: “she’s a star.”
Smith hopes to keep her dream job for as long as she can. “I can’t believe I get to work here,” she says. “Our cultural heritage — of any kind — it’s part of our human soul. Making sure that it lives as long as it can is really important to me.”

Growing up in South Africa, I learned about my nation’s heroes: We knew the stories of Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu like the backs of our hands; we were closely familiar even with our nation’s villains — from Cecil John Rhodes with one foot in Cape Town and one in Cairo, to Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, to P.W. Botha, who defended apartheid in its hour of need.
It was only once I came to Harvard and dug through its archives that I learned about Samuel P. Huntington, the Harvard Government professor who was the strategist from across the equator.
It is easy to miss Huntington’s contribution to the effort to resuscitate apartheid in the 1980s. At the time, the question of divestment from pro-apartheid groups was a concern for then-President Derek C. Bok, and found its way onto the front page of many publications.
It wouldn’t quite be right to say that apartheid South Africa was on its knees in 1976. It would be more accurate to say that the system was growing more and more out of breath each day, its pulse rising, its limbs weakening, but by no means giving out. On June 16 of that year, as many as 20,000 students took to the streets in protest in Soweto, 176 of whom were shot and killed by the state police — gunshots that were heard around the world.
By 1978, mounting international pressure coupled with a growing internal resistance movement made it clear to apartheid South Africa’s new Prime Minister P.W. Botha that, in his words, white South Africans would have to “adapt or die.” For Harvard, it was something closer to divest or suffer the consequences of a tarnished reputation. In an open letter written that same year, Bok wrote, “no responsible person can fail to deplore the reprehensible nature of apartheid.” Still, it took eight more years for Bok to act on the moral strength of these words and finally cut investments.
According to the University’s policies on accessing archival material, to know what the thoughts of those working from the inside, one would have to return to Pusey Library 50 years after the creation of any administrative document from the time, around the year 2040. In a library collection 20 million volumes deep, any attempt to paint a fuller picture of Harvard in the time of apartheid seems to be in vain.
My attempt might have ended there; with resignation, towards a history that, at least for the time being, appeared unknowable. Yet, had I done so, I might never have known that one of the most extensive sets of archival materials to do with apartheid would be found in Huntington’s personal archives.
During the ’80s, a decade of deadly state-sanctioned violence, Huntington visited South Africa as an unofficial adviser to Botha’s government.
In his keynote address to the Political Science Association of South Africa in Johannesburg on Sept. 17, 1981, Huntington introduced a twin policy he called “repression and ‘reform.’” Reform, Huntington said, was necessary because, “It seems likely that a minority-dominated hierarchical ethnic system in South Africa will become increasingly difficult to maintain.” These policies marked the start of a decade of blood.
He later added, “Perhaps the hardest lesson to learn for governments sensitive to the needs of reform is the importance of introducing reforms from a position of strength.” Otherwise, Huntington said, reforms would “weaken the regime” and “provoke a counter-revolutionary backlash.” One can only wonder what Botha took “a position of strength” to mean. The ’80s was the decade of national States of Emergency, of tanks and army apparatus stationed in the townships, of regular detention without trial, of assassinations and extrajudicial killings that, even today, long to be answered for.
Huntington was a proponent of consociationalism, one of the political structures proposed to end the conflict. He described the structure as “an elite conspiracy to restrain political competition within and among communal groups,” essentially arguing that the “elites” who represent each political group, which were to be divided along ethnic lines, control the decisions of the group.
To Huntington it was simply a theory, one he would just as easily write in a textbook as in a brief to Botha’s government. Today, it is what keeps the prospects of a child born in affluent Sandton a world apart from those of a child born in the impoverished township of Alexandra, just 18 minutes away.
Few remnants of apartheid are more apparent today than the long and stubborn legacy of spatial apartheid, the segregationist geographical planning which Huntington helped create. This form of apartheid forcefully relocated Black South Africans to the “homelands,” territories designated to divert Black people from cities. Residents of the “homelands” were barred from South African citizenship and, with it, constitutional protections. In his 1981 address, Huntington said, “Continued adherence by the South African government to the homelands policy, for instance, may make it easier for the government to introduce some form of political representation for the coloureds and Asians.” (It’s important to note that, in South Africa, “coloured” is a non derogatory term which refers to individuals who would be called “mixed-race” in the U.S.) Indeed, in Botha’s “reforms”of the ’80s, coloured, Asian and white South Africans were included in parliament, while Black South Africans were made to remain in the townships they had been condemned to.
“Huntington’s reform strategy quite definitely informed the South African government’s efforts,” a 1987 Crimson article stated. “His 1981 paper helped provide the intellectual justification for, and is cited extensively in, proposals for the 1984 constitution, cornerstone of State President P.W. Botha’s so-called reforms.”
Huntington ultimately assessed that by “concocting the proper mixture of reform, reassurance, and repression,” a government would be successful in ensuring its continuation. He believed that if South Africa “played on fear and employed deception,” the country’s opponents would back down. Yet, the prevailing story of apartheid is the story of the opposition to it, both within South Africa and beyond it, even as far as places like Harvard. Students at the University mobilized against apartheid time and time again.
The legacy of apartheid is still apparent in South Africa; it’s a legacy that has perpetuated the conditions of racism and poverty. Part of that legacy traces all the way to Cambridge, Massachusetts — to Samuel Huntington. I wonder if he anticipated how far his ideas would spread.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Education experts and advocates called for financial aid transparency in higher education and greater support for first-generation students at a Harvard Graduate School of Education webinar Wednesday.
The event marks another installment of the school’s Education Now webinar series, which follows the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the state of education in the United States.
Wednesday’s panel was moderated by Francesca B. Purcell, an HGSE senior lecturer and the faculty director of the school’s Higher Education Program.
Panelist Quentin Jenkins, a Pitzer College senior who is the first in his family to attend university, said his support system was a critical factor in facilitating a smooth transition into higher education.
“Very early on, I met the college president at the time, Dr. Melvin Oliver, and he was very welcoming,” Jenkins said.
“Seeing that someone so high up in the school was just open to having those conversations and caring about my specific experience at the college made me feel more welcome there,” he added.
Jenkins started Nobody Fails at Pitzer, a student group at Pitzer that successfully advocated for a “universal A” policy, a grading system that made all courses pass-fail and all passed classes worth a 4.0 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The policy lasted for one semester after the college switched to remote learning.
HGSE professor Susan M. Dynarski ’86, another panelist, also referenced her own experience as a first-generation college student. She said first-generation students have a particularly steep learning curve for norms such as attending professors’ office hours, and she called on colleges to assist students through this adjustment.
“In the moment, we can try to put on the glasses and see the perspective of a student who’s experiencing all this for the first time, who doesn’t have a college-educated parent to guide them through the process, and think about how to help them to the resources they need,” Dynarski said.
According to Dynarski, many people who would normally receive full financial aid to college do not apply due to a lack of information. To combat this inequity, Dynarski said she advocates for targeted free college, a program where colleges identify and communicate with students that are eligible for full financial aid for four years at the beginning of the application process.
“We’ve got a financial aid system in which you don’t really find out what your cost of college is going to be until you apply to a college, have been admitted to that college, and got an aid offer from that college,” Dynarski said.
Another significant barrier to making college more accessible is universities’ resistance to change, according to panelist Yolanda Watson Spiva, president of Complete College America. Watson Spiva’s work focuses on closing the differences in college completion rates across racial and socioeconomic groups.
“Unfortunately, we’re held back by antiquated policies or practices,” Watson Spiva said. “When you onboard a new person, you tell them, ‘This is the way we do it,’ and unfortunately we pass on bad behavior.”
In addition, Jenkins said institutions may be reluctant to consider proposed reforms that aren’t feasible in “the snap of a finger.”
“But, I think by having those conversations and letting students know, ‘We hear you, we value what you’re saying, and we can come to a compromise amongst each other,’ that will create a relationship between them to continue working toward the betterment of the institution,” Jenkins said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost a year after Harvard released a landmark report detailing the University’s ties to slavery, student activists are calling for the denaming of Winthrop House.
More than 200 Harvard affiliates have signed a petition demanding the denaming of Winthrop to kickstart an official denaming request. Organized by a group of more than 30 students — including members of the Generational African American Students Association and Natives at Harvard College — the petition states the two John Winthrops for whom the house was named were “instrumental in creating, maintaining, and defending” slavery.
The earlier John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and a Harvard overseer, enslaved at least seven people and ordered 17 prisoners in the Pequot War to be sold as slaves. His descendant, also named John Winthrop, owned two enslaved individuals and served as acting president at Harvard for a year.
“John Winthrop House carries as its namesake and crest the burden of a century of African slavery and Indigenous massacre,” the petition reads.
Clyve Lawrence ’25, one of the leaders of the project and a Crimson editorial editor, worked with a team of five students to research both John Winthrops following the release of Harvard’s long-awaited report on its ties to slavery. Lawrence said the team examined primary sources including the first Winthrop’s diary, as well as secondary sources, to learn about the figures’ actions.
The team’s research found that Governor John Winthrop helped legalize slavery in Massachusetts, while his descendant allowed students to prepare defenses of slavery at Harvard’s 1773 Commencement ceremony.
“We can easily argue that Winthrop should be denamed because those values do not match the mission of the University today,” Lawrence said.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on student demands to dename Winthrop.
Kiersten B. Hash ’25, the political action chair of GAASA, said group members reached out to Lawrence and the team researching the John Winthrops to make denaming the house into a GAASA project.
“There were conversations with me and the other board members who had just been elected, as well as the general generational African American community, about how we want Harvard to address their legacy of slavery because there was so much damning information that came out,” Hash said.
Hash said the team is in the “home stretch” of finishing the denaming request, which will be submitted through the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Process for Denaming Spaces, Programs, or other Entities. The FAS deadline for requests this academic year is March 1, 2023.
If the denaming request is rejected, then a petition to dename Winthrop cannot be submitted for the next five years except in “extraordinary circumstances,” per the FAS policy.
In a Tuesday email to Winthrop residents, faculty deans Stephen N. Chong and Kiran Gajwani acknowledged the petition and wrote they are “in the process of arranging a series of discussions” regarding the “critically important” topic.
“This is a difficult but important conversation for us to have in Winthrop, and part of a larger conversation that is taking place throughout the University and beyond,” the deans wrote. “We recognize that these are painful and challenging issues, and we are grateful for your patience and participation as we engage in these conversations as a community.”
NAHC member Ashley E. Dawn ’26, who worked on writing and distributing the petition and planning an upcoming demonstration, said she became involved because of the importance of “reconciling with Massachusetts’ colonial past.”
“I really think that Massachusetts has a long way to go in recognizing and correcting the colonial history that we have — that is deeply intertwined with our strong sense of American patriotism,” Dawn said.
Dawn said she believes “denaming is a very good place to start” in acknowledging Harvard’s ties to slavery and treatment of indigenous peoples.
Lawrence said he was “shocked” when he first read Harvard’s report on its history of slavery.
“Learning about these men owning slaves, enslaving people, and how Harvard kind of brushed over that in a lot of places just really surprised me,” he said.
Harvard’s landmark report on the school’s ties to slavery also found that Mather House, Leverett House, the Dudley Community, Wigglesworth Hall, and Stoughton Hall were named for affiliates who owned slaves or whose relatives owned slaves.
In 2020, more than 300 Harvard affiliates signed a petition to rename Mather, but the house’s then-faculty deans said there were no plans to do so.
While Lawrence said the primary goal of the project is to dename Winthrop, he emphasized that denaming is “not just removing or renaming.”
“It is a specific process of contextualization and acknowledgment,” he said. “I also hope that it starts a conversation within the student body and within the broader community about what it means to name spaces after people — what it means to reckon with Harvard’s legacy of slavery.”

When Nehir Toklu ’25 first heard about the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria, she was unaware of their magnitude or the extent of the damage they had caused.
Toklu heard the news from her sister, who called her from her home city of Diyarbakir, located nearly 200 miles from the epicenter of the magnitude 7.8 earthquake. Toklu said she knows people who have died in other cities but added it was fortunate her immediate family was not hurt.
“Everyone in Turkey immediately knew that it was going to be terrible,” she said. “It just feels so real and unreal at the same time.”
Ratip “Emin” Berker ’22-’23, who had been in Turkey for two months prior to the earthquake, landed in the U.S. just 30 minutes before the earthquake hit on Feb. 6.
“Although we knew the magnitude of the earthquake, it was really hard to estimate the magnitude of the damage done,” he said. “When I slept and woke up the next day, that’s when I realized how bad it was.”
Berker said his family lives far from the epicenter and did not know about the earthquake until he called to check on them. Since then, Berker’s family has joined the ongoing relief efforts in Turkey, helping relocate the hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced by the earthquake’s damage.
Toklu, a member of the Harvard Turkish Students Association, said it has been difficult for her and other Turkish students to be so far from home and “completely aware” that life has stopped in Turkey.
“It’s strange to be far away from everything that’s going on there, and having to continue with our normal daily lives when we have not really gotten the chance to grieve,” she said.
“I think we all feel a certain amount of guilt for being here, but I’m also happy that I’m here because I feel like with everything that we’ve done here with collecting funds and stuff, I think we all have done more than we could have if we were there,” she added.
The Office of the Muslim Chaplain and Memorial Church sponsored a vigil for victims of the earthquakes on Feb. 16, and the Harvard Turkish Student Association and Harvard Society of Arab Students have collected more than $30,000 in donations through fundraising campaigns for relief efforts in Turkey and Syria.
Berker, a former TSA president, said he “wouldn’t have imagined” the scale of donations the fundraising campaigns have received, attributing their success to the organizing efforts of Turkish, Kurdish, and Syrian students on campus.
“A lot of them worked really, really hard for days and hours to raise funds and send it to Turkey as fast as we could to help the earthquake survivors,” he said.
Berker described the individual response from non-Turkish and non-Syrian students as “overwhelmingly heartwarming,” calling it something he will “never forget.”
Despite the outpouring of support within and outside the Turkish and Syrian communities on campus, Toklu said she found the University’s response to be “quite late” and “slightly underwhelming.”
Following a lack of a university-wide response, more than 840 Harvard affiliates signed an open letter addressed to President Lawrence S. Bacow urging Harvard to raise awareness about the disaster, encouraging the University to send emails linking to support organizations and publicizing them on the school’s official social media platforms.
Berker, who called the University’s response “asymmetric” and “skewed,” said an email to Harvard affiliates acknowledging the earthquake would have been “much more appropriate” and could have fueled donation efforts and awareness.
“I do think that sometimes the magnitude of the response it gives to different catastrophes around the world is not perfectly in sync with the magnitude of the catastrophe itself,” he said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on student criticisms.
Toklu acknowledged that the effects of the earthquakes will “be a problem for months,” but said she is happy about the support the Turkish community has received.
“The losses are irreversible and it’s scary, but hopefully the things we do at least be of sufficient help for someone somewhere,” Toklu said.

Lucien V. Alexis Jr. ’42, the first Black player on the Harvard Lacrosse team, will be honored in a commissioned painting as a part of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations Portraiture Project, the Foundation announced at an event on Feb. 13.
The portrait — which will debut spring 2024 in a to-be-announced location — will be painted by Steven E. Coit ’71. As an artist for the portraiture project, Coit has produced more than 20 portraits to redecorate campus to reflect the diverse figures that shaped the University’s past.
As a member of Adams House, Alexis was the first Black undergraduate to be given housing at the college. He was also the only Black member of the Class of 1942.
“This project aims to uplift the stories of the trailblazing individuals who have been a part of our rich university history,” Abraham wrote in a statement for the Harvard Foundation. “Our hope is that students, faculty, staff, and administrators see themselves in these portraits and are inspired by those that came before us.”
Speakers at the announcement event included Coit, newly-appointed campus curator Brenda D. Tindal, Harvard Foundation Senior Director Sadé Abraham, Associate Dean for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro, and Fred Asare-Konadu ’24, Isaiah Dawson ’23, and Jaden B. Jernigan ’24 — three Black players on the Harvard men’s lacrosse team.
“Today’s program signals the important efforts underway to support our shared understanding of our complex institutional narratives and deepen our appreciation of the diverse peoples and events that shape our past, impact our present, and inform our future,” Tindal said at the event.
In 1941, the Harvard team was not allowed onto the U.S. Naval Academy lacrosse field because Alexis was a member of the team. Though the coach and manager refused to withdraw Alexis from the game, sitting Harvard athletic director William J. Bingham, Class of 1916, overruled them and sent Alexis back to Cambridge.
Following a 0-12 loss for Harvard, students organized a protest and circulated petitions to administrators, elected officials, and even President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904. The Harvard Athletic Association announced shortly after organizing efforts that the school would no longer withdraw players because of their race.
“The story of Lucien earmarks a pivotal inflection point in the history of lacrosse, and of Harvard, and equally reminds us of just how far we’ve come, and how much further we have to go,” Dawson said during the event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite two open letters demanding the resignation of Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf this year, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he “absolutely” still has confidence in Elmendorf’s leadership during a Tuesday interview.
Elmendorf drew widespread backlash in early January for blocking former Human Rights Watch head Kenneth Roth from serving as a fellow at the Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights, a move Roth said was due to his past criticism of Israel. Elmendorf reversed his decision to block Roth from the fellowship amid faculty criticism and an open letter calling for his resignation that garnered more than 1,000 signatures.
Elmendorf faced a second round of calls to resign in early February after The Crimson reported that the dean is forcing out online misinformation expert Joan M. Donovan from her role at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and ending her research project, according to three HKS staff members with knowledge of the situation.
Bacow praised Elmendorf for publicly reversing his decision to block Roth’s fellowship and for being “willing to accept responsibility,” which Bacow called “worthy of both respect and support.”
“I think Doug did something which is all too infrequent in society these days,” Bacow said. “In the face of new information, he was willing to change his mind. He announced that publicly, and then basically apologized for not having reached the right decision before.”
“Nobody bats 1000,” he added.
Roth said in a Wednesday interview that he is not aware of any “new information” that arose about his fellowship candidacy that may have influenced Elmendorf’s decision aside from a Jan. 17 “emergency meeting called of the faculty” to discuss his case. Elmendorf reversed his decision on Roth’s fellowship two days later.
“My understanding is that not a single faculty member spoke in favor of Elmendorf’s decision. Everybody thought it was a mistake,” Roth said. “Those were not ‘new facts.’ Those were just a complete repudiation of what Elmendorf had done.”
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith declined to comment on the Jan. 17 faculty meeting, pointing to Elmendorf’s statement earlier last month saying that he “made an error” in his decision.
“I am sorry that the decision inadvertently cast doubt on the mission of the School and our commitment to open debate in ways I had not intended and do not believe to be true,” Elmendorf wrote last month. “The broader faculty input I have now sought and received has persuaded me that my decision was not the best one for the School.”
Roth said on Wednesday that he is requesting an inquiry into Elmendorf’s initial decision to block his fellowship.
“That’s the best way to avoid something like this happening again,” he said. “Even if Elmendorf wants to hide behind this ‘partial confidentiality’ of the appointment process, that should not preclude an internal investigation.”
Bacow said during the interview that the University is not conducting an official investigation into Roth’s initial rejection from a fellowship at the Kennedy School.
Roth also reiterated his call for the University to publicly affirm the academic freedom of affiliates to discuss issues related to Israel and Palestine, a demand Roth also articulated during his appearance at an Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum earlier this month.
Roth said he met with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Bacow’s Chief of Staff Patricia S. Bellinger ’83 while he was on campus, but Garber did not agree to issuing a public statement that specifically defended academic freedom when discussing Israel and Palestine.
“He said, in essence, ‘No, because there are lots of controversial issues out there and I don’t want to single out Israel and Palestine,’” Roth said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is “committed to being a place that embraces academic freedom and freedom of speech, and the engagement in discourse around ideas and views.”
“This commitment is fundamental to our community’s values, among them the belief that our differences in backgrounds and views enrich the campus and academic experience for our students, faculty and staff,” Newton wrote. “Any suggestion that this commitment does not include views on Israel-Palestine is inaccurate.”

For 79 years, Grolier Poetry Book Shop on Plympton Street in Harvard Square was owned, operated, and frequented primarily by white Cambridge residents.
In 2006, however, Ifeanyi A. Menkiti broke the mold, becoming the first Nigerian-born immigrant to own the oldest continuously running bookshop dedicated to poetry in the nation.
Though Menkiti died in 2019, the bookshop remains in his family and has strived to make poetry more inclusive, according to his daughter Ndidi N. Menkiti ’06.
“I think it’s a little bit exciting and revolutionary that my dad, as a Nigerian immigrant, bought this store that was located in the middle of Harvard and kind of was a boys’ club place for the likes of Robert Lowell and Eliot,” she said.
Grolier Poetry Book Shop is now one of a handful of black-owned businesses in Harvard Square making strides in diversifying small business ownership.
Today, there is a “lot of diversity” among business owners in Harvard Square, according to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, but there are still “hurdles that many members of the BIPOC community have to encounter.”
“We do not have enough Black-owned businesses,” Jillson said.
In recognition of Black History Month, The Crimson interviewed three prominent Black business owners in Harvard Square to share their stories.
Karine Ernest, owner of Le Macaron French Pastries’ Cambridge location, was born in Haiti and immigrated to the United States when she was four.
Raised primarily in Boston, she said being a business owner was “definitely something that was inspiring” for her and something that she always wanted to do.
After graduating from Wellesley College with a dual degree in Economics and French, she worked in telecommunications, but was always drawn to the world of entrepreneurship.
“I always had that little bug in my ear — somehow be an entrepreneur,” Ernest said.
Returning to business school for an MBA at Babson College was no small feat for Ernest, given that she was raising two children at the time.
After graduating with a “child on the hip,” she learned of the Le Macaron chain.
“I completely fell in love. I love the business model. It was simple, and it was definitely something I felt comfortable with. I love the product,” Ernest said.
“And so we opened up August 12 of 2022 in Harvard Square, and we have a fabulous location,” she added.
Securing a franchise location, however, can be particularly “difficult” for Black small business entrepreneurs like herself, Ernest said.
“You found the perfect space. You have the qualifications. Why is the landlord considering someone else that doesn’t seem as qualified?” she said.
“You start to wonder, is it a racial thing? Is it because I’m Black? That’s always in the back of your mind,” she added.
Doing business in Cambridge has been a “wonderful experience,” Ernest said, but she acknowledged that developing the kind of support network and finding the right “allies” can be challenging for other Black business owners.
“I think, as a Black entrepreneur, oftentimes that’s something that we don't have,” Ernest said. “I was fortunate that I had a lot of people that I could reach out to and ask questions.”
For Ernest, opening Le Macaron’s Harvard Square location was an “incredible achievement.”
“I think we’ve been very welcomed and accepted by the community,” Ernest said, “And we’re excited to break some barriers — a milestone so to speak.”
Oggi Gourmet owner Steve Welch was born on the small Caribbean island of Montserrat.
Studying fashion merchandising in college, he said he did not initially have plans to become a business owner.
“I really didn’t set out to be one. It just sort of happened,” Welch said.
To Welch, being a business owner in Harvard Square is like “being the older brother sometimes and seeing kids grow up.”
Welch added he does not believe he has experienced any particular challenges beyond those faced by most businesses.
“I felt comfortable when I came here. I just wanted to blend in. I didn’t want them to see me as a Black-owned business,” Welch said. “I just want to be, again, another good restaurant that came to Harvard Square.”
He likened the Harvard business community to a “big fabric” — one that encompasses people from “all walks of life.”
“It was like a quilt to me. And I brought my little section of the quilt and blended it with this restaurant and that business over there,” Welch said. “You’ve got to find your balance. Find your niche.”
Ifeanyi Menkiti — the late owner of Grolier Poetry Book Shop — bought the establishment because he believed that the shop was a “cultural institution that needed to survive,” according to his daughter Ndidi Menkiti.
“My dad was a huge believer in the arts and culture and community, and so he was really in love with this idea of art forms that are universal, like poetry, music, drama,” Menkiti added.
Ifeanyi Menkiti earned his PhD in philosophy from Harvard in 1974 and later became a professor at Wellesley College, with his scholarly work focusing on African traditional thought. He merged his penchant for poetry with this academic work as Grolier’s owner.
His background was “so different from a lot of other people in Cambridge” which helped him to “form these friendships and these bonds that endears him to a lot of different people,” according to his daughter.
“We’ve just sort of made it our mission to continue to support and expand the international voices and future queer poets and poets of color,” Menkiti added.

Fellow staff writer Katie E. Hennessey foreshadowed this best nearly four months ago to this day, writing of October: “It’s like the February of the fall semester, but worse.” But now, here we are, and somehow, somewhere (here), February has taken a sharp knife and gutted us all like one of Red’s best catches.
Maybe it’s the weather. Somehow, Cambridge has captured the monopoly on the color gray. WHERE ARE THE LEAVES? WHERE IS THE SUN? I miss that cancerous ball of fire and plasma. And no, I don’t care that there’s some low-pressure system with a warm front and a chance of meatballs. I’m in a high-pressure academically rigorous institution with a warm spot by Canaday that I voluntarily committed myself to — we deserve those photons of happiness just as much as our friends on the West Coast. So hear my cry: STOP THE GRAY! There’s only so much romanticizing my walks to the SEC that a girl can do.
February’s trough-ness could be the weather, or it could be the subtle strain of virus tickling the back of your throat. Based on extensive peer-reviewed and personal experience (there is no peer-reviewed experience), I can confidently and unequivocally say that February is the time that the NSAID and cold medicine people at CVS are raking in the big bucks. Somehow, we’re all sick, whether it’s not-Covid-because-I-tested-but-it-feels-like-Covid-itis, H1N1 (headache1noserunny1), or the good ole stress flu. And you’re not just physically tired. The fact that your roommate is ill and you’ve had a mild headache for the past week and you have morning practice tomorrow and an exam to boot is mentally exhausting, too. If it’s any consolation though, we’re right there with you, headaches and all.
And we certainly can’t forget about romance, arguably the best and worst thing about February. This one’s up to you, dear reader, to decide how February has affected your love life, but I’ll leave you with this tidbit: while taking advantage of free Amorino on Valentine’s Day (thanks Datamatch!), my friend and I somehow 11th-wheel. Not third-, fourth-, fifth-, but 11th.
So yeah, February is a pretty booty month. But there’s some great things about it too: random 60-degree days that foreshadow spring break. Pistachio gelato. The debut of the gassed up HUDS menu. Blind dates. Heavily discounted Valentine’s candy (but also the heinous appearance of Easter-themed candy two months too early). If I’ve learned anything from Math 21a, it’s that when you’re at a minimum, it’s only up from here — and that spring break is only two weeks away!
