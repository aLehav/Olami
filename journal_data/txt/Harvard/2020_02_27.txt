After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cinema is an illusion. The best action films not only sell audiences on their illusion, but keep that illusion unbroken. The 2010s were a groundbreaking decade for action, from fast paced racing films and standout fight choreography to surprisingly beautifully shot films. Here are the very best of them.
(See: Part 1: Science Fiction, Part 2: Fantasy, Part 3: Superheroes and Part 4: Comedy)
Honorable Mentions:
“Baby Driver” (2017) dir. Edgar Wright
“Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015) dir. George Miller
“Source Code” (2011) dir. Duncan Jones
10. “Ready Player One” (2018), dir. Steven Spielberg
With a commanding control of visual effects and dizzying camera work, Steven Spielberg flourishes his crazed virtual reality adaptation of Ernest Cline’s bestselling novel with style. “Ready Player One” may reach a contrived conclusion, but Spielberg’s return to popcorn entertainment is both a nostalgic celebration of pop culture and a joyous action blockbuster from the moviemaker who does them best.
9. “Pacific Rim” (2013) dir. Guillermo del Toro
Guillermo del Toro once said he would direct “one for me, one for them,” meaning he would alternate between making studio blockbusters and his own auteur films. But even his blockbusters are infused with an effusive love for the craft, complete with beautiful art direction, stunning computer graphics, and engrossing cinematography. Del Toro films most of his set pieces on gorgeous wides, proving it’s possible to have a giant robot movie with an attention span longer than that of a goldfish. Michael Bay should take note.
8. “Edge of Tomorrow” (2014) dir. Doug Liman
Liman's film is “Groundhog Day” crossed with an original science fiction premise: Instead of having a protagonist stuck waking up on the same day everyday trying to discover love, Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is stuck waking up on the same day everyday on a quest to stop an alien invasion.
7. “John Wick: Chapter 2” (2017) dir. Chad Stahelski
Keanu Reeves was born to play John Wick. The “John Wick” franchise is R-rated violence at its most refined: It found its niche in today’s Hollywood with creative choreography and masterful cinematography, using wide shots with largely unbroken takes. Any of the three entries in the “John Wick” franchise could have taken this spot, but “John Wick: Chapter 2” features the most streamlined storytelling and arguably the most memorable kills.
6. “Skyfall” (2012), dir. by Sam Mendes
Daniel Craig returned as James Bond to stylish effect in "Skyfall" after a mediocre entry in “Quantum of Solace.” “Skyfall” cemented Craig’s legacy as Bond with a beautifully shot entry filmed by venerable cinematographer Roger Deakins, spilling with a stunning and often haunting color palette. Mendes wasn't afraid to take bold narrative risks to push audiences into frighteningly tense places — fateful creative decisions that culminated in arguably the greatest Bond film ever made.
5. “Mission Impossible: Fallout” (2018), dir. by Christopher McQuarrie
This spot could easily have gone to “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol” (2011), directed by Brad Bird, but “Mission Impossible: Fallout” is more self-aware and boasts more personal risks. Hollywood simply does not make movies like this anymore: McQuarrie’s film is dedicated to complicated practical effects, real sets, and pinpoint choreography. The “Mission Impossible” franchise has the subtlety of Tom Cruise jumping off an exploding building, but knowing exactly what movie it's trying to be is why the franchise continues to run strong today.
4. “Ford v Ferrari” (2019), dir. by James Mangold
While it’s not an original story by any stretch of the imagination, Mangold’s latest film, which revisits conflicts of individuality versus committee and unbridled passion versus impersonal business, is a well-polished technical masterpiece. Christian Bale and Matt Damon turn in good performances as the film’s leads, the score is fast-paced, and the cinematography soaks the high octane race sequences in gorgeous low-angle wides.
3. “Drive” (2011), dir. by Nicolas Winding Refn
Refn’s film set the precedent for action in the 2010s. Not only is it beautifully shot, depicting the underrepresented criminal underbelly of Los Angeles in haunting shades of tinted blue and orange, it is also extremely restrained — much like the film's emotionally distant and unnamed central character (Ryan Gosling). Refn flourishes "Drive" with occasional cathartic outbursts of violence and fast-paced chase sequences to balance this bone-chilling thriller.
2. “1917” (2019), dir. by Sam Mendes
“1917” pushes the limits of the cinematic medium. Mendes’ magnum opus flaunts the work of a technical master in his prime, with historically great work from cinematographer Roger Deakins (who picked up his second Academy Award for the film). “1917” is a World War I film that’s shot to look like it was a single continuous take — and that’s as immersive as a war experience can get.
1. “Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation” (2015) directed by Christopher McQuarrie
While it’s indisputable that “1917” is action cinema at its finest, action cinema at its most entertaining doesn’t get much better than “Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.” McQuarrie’s introduction to the blockbuster franchise is a masterclass in pitch-perfect pacing, style, and a committed performance from Tom Cruise. It’s more tonally consistent than “Mission Impossible: Fallout” and characters are marginally more fleshed out than its predecessor “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.”

On Feb. 14, English singer-songwriter Sam Smith released their latest single, the titular track off their forthcoming, third studio album “To Die For.” A song about searching for love so true that it is worth dying for, “To Die For” is the perfect anthem for those who have love to give but no one to give it to.
The fourth official single from the unreleased album, “To Die For” is unlike its predecessors. “Dancing with a Stranger,” by Smith and Normani, is an upbeat pop ballad about looking for a rebound and not wanting to be alone after a failed relationship. “How Do You Sleep,” while still about heartbreak and sorrow, is also an uptempo, danceable track, complete with a dance-heavy music video. The third single is a cover of Donna Summer’s 1977 hit “I Feel Love” — perfectly danceable, sensual, and fun. “To Die For,” on the other hand, is a melancholy piano ballad about loneliness and love-searching, more fit for a late night cry than a dance floor.
The song is not a happy one and it is not meant to be. While the other tracks from the album share similar themes of love, loneliness, and heartache, their cheerful composition allows the listener to still feel light. “To Die For,” on the other hand, is heavy. Listeners are meant to sit with and share in Smith’s isolation and withdraw from the world around them in the same way that Smith does in the desolate, lonely world that they build in the song. Smith’s lyrics exemplify yearning in its most intense form. Smith openly admits that they are willing to risk the permanence of death for someone to love.
“To Die For” seems perfectly made for those who are single on the most romantic day of the year. The song successfully crafts an image of walking alone in a world where everyone around you is happy and in love, and wishing for the same for yourself. The chorus “Couples holding hands on a runway / They’re all posing in a picture frame / Whilst my world’s crashing down” embodies the feeling of wanting what others have. The following lyrics, “Solo shadow on a sidewalk,” are simple but continue to build the imagery of walking alone.
Sonically, “To Die For” is simple: Smith sings, soft and dejected, over an uncomplicated piano and minimalistic drumbeat. Rather than relying on complex instrumentals, Smith incorporates an audio clip from the 2001 film “Donnie Darko” throughout “To Die For.” In a conversation with his therapist, Donnie opens the single with the line “It is if everyone dies alone.” His therapist responds, “Does that scare you?” Just as the drumbeat kicks in, Donnie says “I don’t wanna be alone.” This question and response play several times during the song, adding to the forlorn feeling that Smith crafts with their lyrics and tone.
Sam Smith has proven through their body of work that they know how to make music to yearn, hope, and love to. Whether “To Die For,” the title track of their forthcoming album, will be the thematic foundation of the overall LP is unknown. What is clear is that this single leaves listeners longing not only for love, but for the rest of the album.

Following in the footsteps of Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato, teen icon Zendaya M. S. Coleman has finally managed to un-Disney-ify herself.
After leaving Walt’s hallowed halls, the child stars of Disney have routinely stumbled down the path of over-correction, working to rebel against their cherubic public images. Who can forget, after all, when Selena Gomez starred in “Spring Breakers,” the A24 film about a group of college students’ drug- and crime-fueled vacation to Florida? Or when Miley Cyrus smoked marijuana onstage at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards?
Zendaya first rose to fame on Disney Channel in 2010 as Rocky Blue, star of the sitcom “Shake It Up.” Both Rocky and her best friend, CeCe, played by Bella Thorne, are background dancers on a show called “Shake It Up Chicago.” In real life, Thorne is now just as famous for her highly-publicized, highly-dramatized romantic relationships as she is for her Disney-channel days.
Like most Disney sitcoms, “Shake It Up” is full of wacky misadventures and coming-of-age mishaps. Zendaya starred on another similarly kooky show, “K.C. Undercover,” about an adolescent spy named K.C, from 2015 to 2018.
In between, Zendaya had many other, non-Disney related career efforts. In 2011, she released two songs: “Swag It Out” and “Watch Me.” A year later, in 2012, she released the single “Replay,” which clambered to No. 40 on the Billboard Top 100. In 2013, she was a contestant on Season 16 of “Dancing with the Stars.” The same year, her debut album reached No. 51 on the Billboard Top 100.
In 2017, Zendaya achieved what could be most reasonably considered commercial success outside of the Disney arena. She starred as Anne Wheeler, a trapeze artist, in the star-studded musical “The Greatest Showman,” and as M.J., the love interest of Spiderman in “Spiderman: Homecoming.” Her song “Rewrite the Stars,” which featured in “The Greatest Showman,” was verified as double-platinum in Australia and platinum in the United Kingdom and United States.
But it wasn’t until 2019, a year after Zendaya finished starring in “K.C. Undercover,” that she found her footing in the world of the adult with “Euphoria.”
“Euphoria,” an HBO series, is an adolescent dystopian nightmare. It follows the lives of high school Gen-Z students as they navigate a technological world oversaturated with drugs, sex, teenage pregnancy, and violence.
Zendaya plays Rue, the central character and narrator. Rue is the antithesis of every Disney channel character. Gone are the rosy cheeks and dimpled smile — Rue is a drug addict with a laundry list of mental illnesses. The show begins with her freshly out of rehab and most definitely not sober following a nasty overdose.
To be sure, Zendaya has not “overcorrected” as much as Miley Cyrus, often hailed as the manifestation of child stardom gone wrong. For one thing, Zendaya is notoriously private, and she keeps her personal life quiet and contained.
Moreover, Zendaya reprised her role as M.J. in “Spiderman: Far from Home.” Her upcoming projects include a film adaptation of “Dune,” a science-fiction blockbuster; a film called “White Lie,” about a light-skinned African American woman who passed as white in order to attend Vassar in the late 19th century; and “Finest Kind,” a crime thriller. Some of these films are family friendly, while others are not. Zendaya has managed to find a middle-ground. She can do both.
If anything, the slight overcorrection brought about by “Euphoria” is less a sudden left turn into raunchy gravitas than it is into layered, textured material. When Zendaya left Disney in 2018, she decided to show the world that she could act — that she could, in fact, star as a troubled, complex teen just as easily as she could star as a bubblegum-pop one.

Chloe Hilliard’s “F*ck Your Diet and Other Things My Thighs Tell Me” is not about a diet.
Certainly, eating and dress size play a significant role throughout Hilliard’s memoir, but, more centrally, “F*ck Your Diet” is about race, love, societal standards (read: societal misdemeanors), and growing up. Food is simply the thread that unites skin color with sex and prepubescence with passive-aggressive office culture.
Hilliard is a comedian, writer, and media personality. In the past, she has written for publications including “The Village Voice,” “The Best American Essays: 2009,” and “The Source,” and she has performed standup comedy on NBC’s “Last Comic Standing,” Comedy Central’s “The Nightly Show,” and MTV’s “Acting Out,” among others.
“F*ck Your Diet” is Hilliard’s debut book, and as such, it is a tour-de-force. It progresses chronologically, beginning with Hilliard’s childhood in a Hasidic neighborhood of Brooklyn and ending with an acceptance of what she is not and will never be: “I’m no food guru, life coach, or empowerment princess.” It covers her childhood as the bullied overweight kid on the playground, her basketball-dominated adolescence, her stint in corporate journalism, and her transition at once into her self-created career and her own skin.
What makes “F*ck Your Diet” so pleasant to read is Hilliard’s omnipresent, tongue-in-cheek humor. That Hilliard moonlights as a comedian (or perhaps moonlights as a writer) is self-evident. Seldom does Hilliard address topics in her novel that are not serious — institutionalized racism, sexism, and the prevalence of body-shaming culture in the United States are not necessarily fodder for jokes, unless done with adroit skill. But Hilliard picks this exact skill neatly out of her sleeve time and time again. During high school, when Hilliard developed anorexia, she describes the time she fainted on the subway: “The only time I knew black women to faint was at funerals and when the Holy Ghost hit them. Otherwise, fainting was reserved for petite white women in movies when they got bad news.” Shortly after losing her virginity to an emotionally stunted boy who, in the midst of the encounter, promptly told her, “Look, it’s gonna hurt,” she describes a discussion they had about green card marriage. “Bruh, slow you roll,” Hilliard writes. “Being a child bride was not in my cards.”
Hilliard’s sense of humor is, in fact, what makes so many somber subjects palatable in a single, 300-page book. Memoirs, even when done successfully — and a successful memoir is a rare find indeed — are often the result of sorrow and pain. The seminal classics, important and moving as they are — Jeannette Walls’s “The Glass Castle,” Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” and Joan Didion’s “The Year of Magical Thinking,” among others — frequently deal with tears, not laughter, and if they do involve the latter, they do so sparingly.
However, Hilliard accesses the gravity of everyday life with levity. When writing about her stint at the short-lived “Lifetime” magazine, where she experienced incessant microaggressions and systemic racism, she cracks a joke about the problem of speaking with a deep voice on the phone. “Sound happy and less black, got it,” Hilliard says. “Damsels in distress never have bass in their voice. If Britney Spears spoke with more bass, we’d all expect her to have her life together. But, alas, she talks like she’s still in the Mickey Mouse Club.”
Most powerful, though, is how Hilliard speaks about self-acceptance and the love of her own body. The shaming of women is a popular topic of conversation in the 21st century, particularly in the post-#MeToo era, but it’s also a deeply necessary one. Hilliard fully rants about how a woman’s “value is determined by a set of draconian standards better suited to accommodate the male ego than the woman’s emotion and physical needs… The berating continues until it’s drilled into the subconscious.”
The party line at the heart of “F*ck Your Diet” is, admittedly, a little trite and more than a little overdone. “Love yourself” is plastered over half of every HomeGoods and three-quarters of most Pinterest discover pages. “F*ck Your Diet” is not particularly inventive, or riveting, or groundbreaking.
But it is funny, and even if its message has been said time and time again, it is still critical to the growth of women in a society that rarely accepts them as such, choosing instead to label them as girls because girls are far easier to understand. One of the final lines of “F*ck Your Diet,” in a section in which Hilliard outlines what she hopes her readers learned, is also one of its best: “I’ve given you reason to reexamine the things you thought made you undesirable or unworthy.”

Well-known for her critically acclaimed novel “The House of the Spirits,” Isabel Allende is back with another novel spanning an impressively large geography and time. “A Long Petal of the Sea” follows the Dalmau family and their friends as they travel across the globe, first as refugees departing Spain under Francisco Franco’s regime, then as exiles to Chile and Venezuela. The novel itself is undeniably brilliant and rich — it is, however, just like “The House of the Spirits,” a war of attrition to read.
It is a protracted endeavor to read a novel that encompasses as much content and seeks to cover as much ground as Allende’s “A Long Petal of the Sea.” Readers of “The House of the Spirits” may remember a novel that tracked generations of women and their countless happenings with a tireless and seemingly never-ending narrative. The same type of storytelling happens in “A Long Petal of the Sea”: Allende, once again, writes in her typical style — as a narrator, recording a long string of continuous events, and as a historian, gathering scattered details to form a long-winded and tiresome story.
The novel follows the adventure and romance of Victor Dalmau and his wife, Roser, who carries the child of Victor’s dead brother. Married to facilitate their emigration from Spain as refugees and to ensure that they will be allowed to stay together, Victor and Roser’s lives undergo tremendous trials and momentous upheaval as a result of the political turmoil of Franco’s regime, France’s hostility towards Spanish refugees, and Augusto Pinochet’s military coup in Chile. Throughout all of this chaos, one thing holds steady — the quiet dedication and love Victor and Roser have for each other and the other members of their fractured family, sundered and scattered across the globe.
“A Long Petal of the Sea” is rich with historical details that must have taken an enormous effort to unearth. Unfortunately, the resulting mosaic of historical fact and narrative embellishment is an overwhelming wave of information: Pages on pages inundate the reader with irrelevant historical details and lists of events. The book itself feels like one massive list. Despite the beauty of Allende’s writing and the emotional impact of the characters’ lives and struggles, the lingering impact of this book is not a reaction at the content, but an unbearable exhaustion at having to wade through 314 pages of unimportant banalities to arrive at the important thematic conclusion of the novel.
This is not to say that the work isn’t beautiful — it most certainly is. It is a remarkable feat to create a cohesive story out of the fragmentation and historical fracturing and inconsistency of the time period that Allende chooses to write about. But, just as the circle of Victor Dalmau’s past love Ofelia del Solar “closed neatly…without leaving any ashes,” so too, do all of the plotlines of this novel come to a neat close.
The cleanliness by which Allende’s story reaches its resolution appears, at first, counterintuitive to much of the thematic messaging of the text. After all, “Entropy is the natural law of the universe, everything tends toward disorder, to break down, to disperse. People get lost… feelings fade, and forgetfulness slips into lives like mist.” Yet there is something distinctly poignant in Allende’s ability to render form within the absolute chaos of the lives of the characters. Despite being a collection of fragmentary, scattered pieces of lives and history, out of this chaos emerges a definitive sense of resolution and beauty. Perhaps, then, this form is not at all at odds with the content of “A Long Petal of the Sea”: Allende may wish to induce a realization of the paradoxical order, purpose, and beauty that emerge out of the absolute entropy of the universe.
But the beauty of Allende’s message is polluted by the sheer frustration of the amount of useless words that must be read in order to grasp a rather simplistic thematic conclusion. Allende would do well to remind herself of her own words: “Governments come and go, but poets remain.”
Though historical details are important in world-building and rendering a multifaceted, rich story, “A Long Petal of the Sea”s oversaturation with unnecessary details about the comings and goings of governments obfuscates the poetry of Allende’s words.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a non-liberal student on Harvard’s campus, I’ve always had an instinct to stay quiet about my beliefs. I could never pin down why, though. Sure, there is the sheer fact that only 10.3 percent of students in the class of 2023 consider themselves to be somewhat conservative (while 2.1 percent call themselves very conservative). Overall, however, I’ve usually been able to override my instinct to remain subdued.
Recently, I was able to pin down a reason. While talking to a peer about her work with a conservative woman on campus — a moderate, at that — I asked her if she was conservative herself. She looked as though I had uncovered her deepest secret. Her eyes bulged and she stuttered. My first impression was that she was nervous to admit her conservatism; however, after reflecting, I’m almost positive that her apprehension was due to the common association of conservatism with Trumpism at Harvard.
The fear of being associated with Trump and the current Republican Party stifles conversations between liberal and conservative students while simultaneously delegitimizing conservative students’ beliefs. Going forward, both groups must take steps to create a productive, respectful dialogue. Moreover, liberals must correct their understanding of conservative views, and conservatives must overcome their fear of being labeled as supporters of a widely unpopular president among Harvard students.
Liberal students must take steps to differentiate Trumpism from conservatism. While some conservative students do support the president, my bet is that most on this campus do not (though if they do, their reasons for doing so may be surprising and acceptable to liberals upon open dialogue). Here is why: The president does not govern conservatively. The Trump administration has “hijacked” a traditionally conservative party and imposed on it a mix of populist assertions. As the GOP undergoes an identity crisis, a huge contingent of the party is finding itself politically displaced.
There are a few key distinctions between today’s party and the current administration. Conservatism does not entail an overall rejection of change, but is a moderated and controlled attitude towards change that asserts that when the government tries to resolve one issue, it usually creates more. Yet while many conservatives celebrate free trade, little government involvement, and consequently less spending, this administration has pursued heightened protectionism and huge amounts of government spending and expansion. Of course, it is hard to define conservatives as a whole over space and time, but what I can say with confidence is that just ten years ago, the Trump platform would not have survived a Republican primary.
With a better understanding of general conservative principles, liberal students may start to see conservatism as a distinct political philosophy and differentiate it from the surge of populism that they so harshly condemn. In the same vein, liberal students should also consider engaging Trump supporters in conversation to understand their standpoints — some of which will certainly be reasonable. In this way, they can leave the echo chambers that condemn and misconstrue the conservative ideology. Understanding leads to the type of dialogue that can heal the divides between ideologically opposed students on this campus.
While liberal students need to educate themselves and open the dialogue to all views, conservatives need to step up and stand by their opinions. Only then can they destigmatize their beliefs on campus.
Conservative students’ fear is understandable, however. The automatic association between President Trump and conservatism is not just deeply flawed, but it can even be dangerous for non-liberal students. The President is broadly perceived as an unintelligent, even malicious, individual in most circles on this campus. Take a moment and think about what your reaction would be if you were falsely accused of voting for President Trump and thus associated with those traits. Surely you would do everything in your power to dismiss the accusation. Perhaps you would avoid even bringing up topics that could lead to this conversation.
But even if I, and other non-liberals, fear speaking up, we cannot afford to stay quiet if we hope to engage in comprehensive, inclusive conversations on campus. For instance, I have made it a point to engage my liberal friends in more political conversations. This is always an anxiety-inducing experience at the beginning. In a short amount of time, however, the majority of my peers are surprised by the legitimacy of my opinions and my lack of maliciousness and ignorance.
Going into the 2020 elections, it is now more imperative than ever that liberal students overcome their false associations by listening with an open mind and educating themselves about actual conservatism. At the same time, conservative students also have a job to do: Instead of fearing what others think of them, they must clearly articulate their beliefs in order to distinguish themselves from the false caricatures that have become the defaults in so many of their peers’ minds.

To the Editor:
Several years ago, a colleague I had recruited to serve as a freshman advisor came to my office after meeting an advisee for the first time. “What do I do now?” the professor asked. “This fellow says he no longer wants to study computer science. He wants to do studio art. I haven’t a clue what to tell him.”
“Start by telling him, ‘Congratulations,’” I suggested. “He’s figured out before taking a single class what many Harvard students don’t realize for years—that once they get here, they don’t have to keep doing something they no longer love, just because they think it’s what got them in.”
I thought of this while reading “One in Four Class of 2020 Athletes Quit Varsity Teams During Their Time at Harvard” (February 21). The Crimson’s coverage seems to suggest that 27 percent is a high number, and that students who have changed their minds about what to do at Harvard have violated some institutional norm or expectation. But athletes aren’t bound to do athletics, any more than high school violin virtuosos bear a moral burden to play the violin at Harvard or pre-meds to do medicine after graduating. Ivy League athletics is premised on the freedom of athletes, like other Harvard students, to rethink their interests and commitments. That is why, unlike in many Division I institutions, Harvard financial aid is not tied to continued participation in athletics, to studying any particular academic subject, or even to achieving an honors GPA.
A college where everyone who had been devoted to a particular political, musical, dramatic, academic, or athletic activity at age 17 was still pursuing the same activity with the same intensity at the age of 22 would be a college full of dull, narrow people. The freedom to change your mind and to acquire new interests — that is, the right to an education in the full sense of the term — belongs to athletes at Harvard every bit as much as it belongs to other Harvard students.
Both 0 percent of athletes leaving and 100 percent leaving would be problematic for different reasons. That 25 percent of varsity athletes (some of whom were walk-ons) leave varsity athletics over four years seems to be happy evidence that Harvard athletes learn new things here and think for themselves about how best to use their time. I did exactly that myself some 55 years ago, swapping out lacrosse for computer science research. I learned something valuable from doing each. It is a rare privilege in America to be free to do what you want to do in college — and still to graduate debt-free.

Last week, Harvard announced that Martin “Marty” Baron, current executive editor of the Washington Post and the former executive editor of the Boston Globe, will be the Class of 2020’s commencement speaker. Over his more than 40-year career, teams of reporters under Baron’s leadership have been awarded 16 Pulitzer Prizes and broken stories that shook up not just Boston and the United States, but the world at large.
Baron ran the Globe when the paper’s “Spotlight” team unearthed a widespread practice of sexual abuse by priests across Roman Catholic communities in the Boston area. Also under Baron’s guidance, the Post uncovered and published the Afghanistan papers, exposing malpractice by U.S government officials as they conducted military operations in the Middle East. These journalistic feats speak to the impact of the free press, and to the power that in-depth investigative journalism can have on our lives. Further, they speak to Baron’s own unwavering commitment to speaking truth to power and doing so with care and respect. There is a strong case to be made for Baron’s work representing the best of what journalism ought to look like.
At the same time, Baron’s journalism career, while overwhelmingly bright, has not been spotless. Just this January, Baron was at the center of a controversy over the Post’s decision to suspend a reporter who used her personal Twitter account to retweet an article about the late Kobe Bryant’s 2003 sexual assault case on the day of the famed athlete’s passing. The decision, which was later reversed, has been criticized in the Post itself.
This incident should serve to remind us all that, while the functions of a free press are indispensable, trying to embody journalistic excellence is a never-ending task, and that even the greats are continually tested (and occasionally fail) at this task. The production of good journalism requires constant humility, scrutiny, and ethical vigilance. Continuous striving for a more equitable, representative culture in journalism is a critical part of that task. Baron’s storied career serves to capture the struggles, triumphs, and ultimately the necessity of an industry currently under attack.
Harvard’s selection of Baron as this year’s commencement speaker is an encouraging acknowledgment of the crucial role that journalism plays in any free society. The Globe’s investigation into the Catholic Church and release of the Afghanistan papers are just a few of many instances where Baron, his newspapers, and the press have been able to check institutions of power and hold authorities accountable for their actions. Such work shifts our perceptions of the truth and enhances the richness with which we understand reality. We would be remiss not to praise it.
We also appreciate the way in which Harvard’s choice of Baron pushes against our general idea of what an ideal commencement speaker is. Investigative journalism isn’t the ritziest business. While most Harvard students expect and might covet the selection of someone whose name is universally known, Harvard’s choice of Baron — a name arguably less recognizable than last year’s commencement speaker, Angela Merkel — elevates journalists and their work to an important level parallel to the star-studded list of past commencement speakers such as Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey.
We are excited to hear the perspective that Baron has to share with Harvard’s graduating class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”
The Founding Fathers penned these words in the Declaration of Independence and laid forth a vision of what America could be. There is hope in these words — hope for a world in which all people have their basic needs met, have the freedom to make their own choices, and have the opportunity to pursue a meaningful life in their own way. We have not yet met this vision, but I believe that we have both the ability to achieve it and a moral obligation to do so. We need universal basic income in order to guarantee these rights to all Americans.
UBI advocate Scott Santens has noted that “Poverty is a legal status … Poverty is being legally excluded from having sufficient access to resources to exist.” The existence of poverty is an unnatural violation of people’s right to life. It should not exist and it does not have to. In the United States today there is enough food for people to eat and there are enough beds for people to sleep in. The issue is that basic needs like these cost money. Survival costs money. As a society, we have decided that those without money should not survive — but we can change that. We have a moral duty to change that. Not only do humans deserve, as a right, the basic necessities of survival, but furthermore, nobody has the right to come between a person and what they need to survive. A universal basic income can eliminate poverty entirely by giving people the ability to acquire their basic necessities and ensure the right to life for all Americans.
But survival is not enough; someone in prison has their basic needs taken care of, but that life is not enviable. People also have a right to liberty, defined here as freedom from coercion. In other words, it is the ability to say no. The choice between work and starvation is not a choice at all. That is not freedom. We have decided to structure our society such that most people have no choice but to sell their labor in order to survive. When a person’s life rests in the hands of their employer, they are not free. While we have many protections for workers, we have not abolished this one-sided relationship and the unjust coercive power that comes with it. UBI liberates people from financial dependence on others in every kind of relationship: freedom from exploitative work, abusive partners, and more. Critics of UBI claim that it would reduce people’s desire to work, but that very criticism reveals that much opposition to UBI comes from those who stand to lose their coercive power over others. If someone would quit a job once their basic needs were met, they were only working that job to meet their basic needs — to survive. Therefore, they were coerced into the job by the threat of poverty and did not take the job by their own free will. UBI gives people the chance to be truly free.
What will people do with their newfound freedom? Anything they want. Many people will keep their jobs; people often enjoy the structure, community, purpose, or extra income that comes with a job. Some, once they receive the financial security of UBI, will still work, but will quit their second or third job or limit their hours in order to do more of whatever they enjoy. Others will stop working entirely because those jobs are dangerous, exploitative, or otherwise unpleasant, as they should have the right to do. This reduction of work should be celebrated; our society can function perfectly well without much of the work that people are forced into today. Many people will then have more time to pursue the activities they find most meaningful. UBI recipients will spend more time with their kids and families. They will care for elderly and sick relatives. They will volunteer and start businesses. They will become artists and writers, journalists and students, dreamers and doers. We waste untold potential and systematically crush the human spirit because we force people into needless drudgery just to stay alive. We deny an integral part of the human experience by denying people the chance to create, to explore, and to pursue happiness.
Critics have disparaged UBI as “free money” or a gimmick. What they fail to realize is that money is not the point of UBI. Money is a means to an end: freedom. Freedom from poverty, freedom from coercion, and freedom to strive for self-actualization. Basic income is not charity or welfare. It is a right. We have both the ability and the obligation to end poverty, ensure liberty, and give every American the chance to find their own version of success. We can finally live up to the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and secure these natural rights. There is no reason to wait. The time for universal basic income is now.

Most Harvard students only see their parents on holidays and family weekends. William M. Lese ’20, however, sees his mother, a Master of Public Administration candidate at the Harvard Kennedy School, at least weekly.
When William’s friends walked into GENED 1120: “The Political Economy of Globalization” on the first day of shopping week last fall, they realized William’s mother, Serena B. Lese, was also shopping the class.
“When I first walked into Sever, I thought, ‘Oh, this is a little strange,’” Serena recalls. “I gather that William got some texts later in the day saying: ‘Did I see, like, your mom at Sever?’”
Serena and William are the mother-son duo taking on a Harvard education, together. The pair, originally from New York City, will both graduate in the class of 2020.
“Obviously in class, she becomes a classmate,” William says. “You set aside your home relationship, and you start to engage on an academic level, which you probably haven’t done before.”
Serena says she decided to get her MPA because of what she views as the increased importance of public policy in American politics today. “I’ve always been a very engaged citizen, but I didn’t know a lot about the actual workings at the highest policy level of US and international relations,” she explains.
Serena’s decision to attend Harvard had little to do with her son being there: “If anything, I hope [my enrollment] isn’t going to be a problem,” she says. “He was really nice about it. He was like, ‘We probably won’t even see each other, so it will be fine!’”
Despite the separation between undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard, fate brought them together in IGA 285: "Foreign Policy and the Utility of Military Force," a class they are both taking this semester.
William says their Harvard experiences have intertwined outside of class, too. “[My friends] love my mom around. In fact, sometimes they want to hang out with her more than me, especially when she’s buying lunch,” William adds. “She’s integrated very well into my social life on campus.”
And even though William says their relationship hasn’t changed much since his mom enrolled this year, he also says their conversations at home have become more relevant.
“When she ask[s] me how my day was, I can specifically reference the class that we take together, and we can discuss that material, so that’s less superficial,” he says. “[It adds] more meaning to the simple asking, ‘How was your day?’”
Serena has similar sentiments: The class became a frequent conversation topic between the two of them.
“We’re just catching up, and [William] was like, ‘Well, did you do the [IGA 285] reflection yet?’” Serena recalls. “I felt so much pressure. I was like, ‘I should do the reflection already?’ Total role reversal.”
Despite having his mom on campus as an additional resource, William says that he’s never truly felt homesick.
“I was more worried about my mom being homesick, since my dad’s in New York,” he says.
Summing up his college experience, William contemplates what he values most about his Harvard education as he tackles his last semester.
“Community is why I chose Harvard. Every person I’ve met here in my senior year has been impressive, engaging, and has pushed me to want to do better,” he says.
Little did he know that his mom would be a part of that community, too.
Correction: February 29, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Leses are both taking GENED 1120: “The Political Economy of Globalization." In fact, they are both taking IGA 285: "Foreign Policy and the Utility of Military Force."

Professor Matt R. Saunders ’97 might be teaching the most expensive Gen Ed ever offered.
“I’ve spent $15,000 on supplies, already, within the last three weeks,” Saunders says, sitting in his office — a tiny room tucked away in the far back corner of the Carpenter Center’s drawing studio.
Saunders’ s significant expenses are financed by the budget of the studio art General Education course he is piloting this semester: “Painting’s Doubt: A Studio Course” (Gen Ed 1114). “We provide all of the materials for the classes because we don’t want there to be a limiting factor, and we budget accordingly. So I was concerned about being able to scale that up, but I’ve basically been given everything I’ve asked for, “ Saunders explains.
Usually, Saunders and the other studio art professors in the department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies (AFVS) need to turn away as many as 85% of course applicants every semester for logistical reasons. Besides being disappointed about not being able to teach painting to all who wanted to learn, Saunders was frustrated with this type of selection process because it contributed to a perception on campus that AFVS classes are inaccessible to non-concentrators. “I’ve always thought about how we needed to have bigger gates, and also that there was a real curiosity in the student body, people who were never going to be concentrators, to have that experience of working in this way,” Saunders says, referring to the desire of students to experience the hands-on creation inherent in studio classes.
“Painting’s Doubt” is unlike any other introductory painting course taught at Harvard. While most studio classes are capped at anywhere from 12 to 20 students, Painting’s Doubt has room for 72.
In an effort to serve a more diverse portion of the undergraduate population, Saunders created this six-fold “scale-up” of the typical intro-to-painting studio class so that it could be taught under the Aesthetics and Culture General Education requirement. The number of lottery applications — Saunders cites a figure that falls around 390 students — is reflective of the interest that non-AFVS students have in entering these artistic spaces.


“I know that one of the biggest struggles of students who are interested in visual studies on campus is to figure out how and where to do it,” Saunders says. “I know that, per the demand of the class, I have a lot of people who painted in high school and are excited to do it again.”
After discussing the course, Saunders and I head to the painting studio to check in on one of his four-hour long sections. The students’ first painting assignments are proudly displayed along the walls. Each one is a different representation of the still life scene that is set up in the studio, varying greatly in composition, color, and choice of detail. “For a group of people who largely haven’t painted before, I’m really impressed with how much time people put in and how thoroughly people engaged with [the assignment] and how strong the results are,” Saunders says of the students’ work. “It looks like the work of a first semester class, but it doesn’t look like the first painting.”
The success of Painting’s Doubt hasn’t gone unnoticed by the rest of the AFVS department. Saunders and his colleagues are looking to develop introductory studio Gen Ed courses in a variety of different media, including photography and film. Their goal, Saunders says, is to offer at least one of these intro classes scaled-up as a Gen Ed each year, most likely on a rotating basis. Saunders says the AFVS department’s creation-based engagement with art is essential to enriching the curriculum. He points out, “If we think about Aesthetics and Culture as one of the topics within Gen Ed, we have a lot to say about that.”
Saunders hopes that making studios more accessible to students will influence the way they engage with their studies at Harvard and how they interpret the rest of the world. Saunders knows from experience how much of an impact it can have. “I studied studio art at Harvard,” he explains. “And it changed my life.”

“It feels kind of like people can see you without your clothes on,” says Changie Yuri ’20 as they sit in the afternoon glow of Eliot dining hall during the lull between lunch and dinner.
They are referring to a slim book sitting on the table before them. Its stark white cover is emblazoned with the title “Dear Sarah,” in black ink. And while Yuri happens to be bundled up for this bitterly cold Thursday, the feeling of nakedness they describe makes a lot of sense. "Dear Sarah," Yuri’s self-published collection of “poetry/prose,” bares it all, exploring their “feelings and experiences of mental health, queerness, being Korean American, trans, female, human, nonhuman,” according to its pre-order form.
"Dear Sarah," is divided into three sections based roughly on content and theme: “Phloem,” “Vascular Cambium,” and “Axillary Meristem.” These botanical titles are a nod to Yuri’s secondary concentration in biology and their fascination with plants. Succulents are a special favorite “because of their ability to regenerate even after they get all cut up.”
Yuri’s love of writing began with journaling in middle school. They wrote letters to themself which were addressed “"Dear Sarah,"” and signed “Love, Changie.” These iterations of Yuri’s legal name, Sarah Chang, allowed them to explore their nonbinary gender identity through diary entries, a project of self-exploration which is continued in "Dear Sarah,".
In many ways, "Dear Sarah," creates a space for self-expression at the intersection of genres. Yuri prefers to call the blend of poetry and prose “a collection of words.” Yuri says they don’t have much formal training, and their writing style is influenced by their background in spoken word poetry. This is evident in the sonic quality of Yuri’s poems; they write poetry as they would speak it aloud, unconventional punctuation and spelling included.
Yuri also tries to create an accessible and inclusive space for their audience. Their main reservation in publishing such personal, sensitive material is the challenge of being “honest to [their] experience without triggering [their] readers.” They seek to break the stereotypical poetic molds of sad lamentations and complex, impenetrable language to create a truth that is “as straightforward as possible.” In finding this balance, they hope to allow readers to “understand [them] a little better.”
Yuri describes their writing process as “banging a little out every day,” with the mindset that “this is gonna be shit, but I’m gonna type it up and see if anything is salvageable.” They compare the action of salvaging to a college senior moving out of their dorm room, sorting through what can stay and what must go in order to “pack up four years into, maybe, one collection.”
Yuri accredits much of the inspiration for "Dear Sarah," to their friend and former classmate, Mo Kim ’18. During Kim’s time at Harvard, they also published a book of poetry, donating the proceeds to a trauma center with which they were involved. In hopes of “taking that baton” from Kim, Yuri has chosen to give proceeds from "Dear Sarah," to the Trevor Project — a non-profit organization that offers crisis and suicide intervention resources to LGBTQ+ youth.
"Dear Sarah," pays homage to all versions of Yuri’s being: to the middle schooler furiously typing on “angsty Tumblr poetry blogs”; to the adult ten years from now who is difficult to envision but will probably own “maybe two dogs”; and to Yuri at present, who sits laughing at a white-clothed table, the culmination of four years spent collecting words at their fingertips.
“I think the whole purpose of the book was this idea of not rebirth, but regeneration,” says Yuri. “You don’t necessarily have to sprout an entirely new being to be new.”

The man handing out tickets at the entrance tells me, “Just follow the music — you’ll know.”
In between the skeletal deer exhibits and the taxidermied tiger eyes that watch over the Harvard Museum of Natural History’s halls lie several bubbling jars of fruits and vegetables on a kitchen counter. They’re playing in a band.
Halfway between a mad science experiment and an ethereal concert, this colorful display of dissolving food is known as the Fermentophone — a multi-sensory art installation in which the bubbles emitted by fermenting microbes control the rhythm of a computer-generated musical performance. Once the fermenting’s done, you can even eat it.
The installation resides in the museum’s microbiology gallery, where fungal slimes and bleached tapeworms haunt the walls. Flanked by fluorescent pink lights and a floor-to-ceiling column of green goop from a local swamp, the Fermentophone and its creator, Joshua P. Rosenstock, entertain the curiosity of the surrounding crowd at this installation’s “Meet the Artist” event. Rosenstock explains to the audience that his aim is to create “serendipitous systems” by “cultivating happy accidents that have the potential to evolve themselves.”
Having already experimented with growing fungi on clothing and sprouting plants out of cell phones in previous artistic projects, Rosenstock concluded that microbes were the ideal candidates for his artistic vision. He explains that “they have their own real, tangible sense of being alive. It has this energy to it, which at times can be really almost explosive, literally.” Several jars prove him right during the performance, momentarily overflowing the containers’ lips to an accompanying climax of musical notes.
For each bubble released from a jar’s fermenting stew of locally sourced produce, a microphone picks up the sound of the escaping gas and synthesizes it into a pluck on a virtual stringed instrument, played in real-time. The chords themselves are drawn from a song Rosenstock chooses beforehand. Today’s musical offering is inspired by “Yankee Doodle,” though previous exhibitions of his piece at Harvard showcased “Fight Fiercely Harvard,” and what Rosenstock calls “the old Tom Lehrer ‘making fun of Harvard song.’ Of course, nobody could tell; it was an in-joke for myself.”
The jars themselves are not entirely Rosenstock’s creation; over the piece’s multi-year history, he has led workshops where members of the public add their own fermentation jars to the display. Though microbes quickly turn the food in the jars to mush, the creators’ intentions live on in the names scribbled on the outside, from the “Bubblenaut 3000” to “Oh my Gourd! It’s the… GOURD LORD.” Rosenstock includes these aspects to make the piece participatory and uniquely personal: “That act of titling your work becomes an important part of saying, ‘This is not just a jar of food. I’m making this my work of art.’”
***
In the exhibition space, onlookers discuss the work’s convergence of art and science; a few local “fermentation enthusiasts” point out how it bridges ancient practices of fermentation with the modern digital technology required to create melody from microorganism gurgling. The mysteries of the invisible creatures enthrall the audience, whether it is members of the Boston art scene contemplating “the sonification of a cyclical life force” or a pair of young siblings arguing over which jars’ contents they’d dare to eat. “So is broccoli tastier fermented?” their parents ask shortly afterwards.
Most of all, people debate who the artist is — the man who creates the machine, or the microbes that create the music. While the Fermentophone’s notes themselves never settle on a steady pattern, they are never without pattern either; if you let them, they will tempt and tease melody. On closer inspection, even one of its food-fermenting jars, titled “Dinner,” appears to portray the remains of a face rendered with Picasso-esque abstraction — then again, it may just be two peaches and a carrot.

I don’t know why it took me so long to cry.
Ask anyone who knows me — I cry easier than a toddler at the dentist. But for some reason, it wasn’t the hundreds of patients we’d seen in various stages of disease or the abandoned children ecstatic to receive their first toy who finally broke the dam on my tear ducts. It was a stray mutt minding its own business in the corner of a park in Concepción, Iloilo.
We were in the Philippines for a medical mission trip only days into the new year, and I had arrived expecting to be moved. I was ready to witness suffering and help relieve it; I eagerly anticipated the opportunity to recognize my privilege so that I could be a changed woman when I returned home.
The local Filipino schoolchildren paid the stray no mind as he trotted around the border of the grassy square, looking alert but by no means aggressive. We didn’t notice him at first, either. We were playing with Peyton, the Shih Tzu puppy of a local nurse working in our medical clinic. After screening dozens of women for cervical cancer, we were taking a break from speculums and pap smears to rub Peyton’s fluffy, rounded belly and coo into her flapping ears.
We didn’t look up until he was screaming, and then we couldn’t look away. Panicked yelps and vehement growls filled the square as three men in padded suits secured the net they’d thrown around the stray. Cruel and calm as cartoon villains, they waited until the dog’s thrashing and snapping had diminished into fretful whines before they bound his paws together. They carried him away like this, a whimpering knot of scruffy fur and protruding bones tangled up in mesh.
I glanced down at Peyton, still snuffling in my arms. I had involuntarily turned to shield her from the scene.
I didn’t realize I was crying until my sister patted my back: “You’re a mess.”
***
It comes up sometimes, walking from Sever to the Science Center. It surfaces during the late hours of night, between abandoned problem sets and passionate rants. We talk about school shootings and terrorist attacks; boys of color shot in the back for walking; coronavirus.
When people ask me about the most memorable thing I saw on my trip to the Philippines, I don’t tell them about the stray mutt — they’d only sigh sympathetically, more concerned about my wellbeing after witnessing such brutality than the dog’s welfare. When we talk poverty and privilege and power, interpolated between small talk about exams and ex-boyfriends, the puppy fits into the latter category.
Instead, I tell them about a patient: a woman who lifted her purple shirt to reveal a monstrous, fungating tumor protruding from her left breast. Scarlet, furious, pulsing, it leaked serous fluid through the makeshift bandages that struggled to contain it. According to her file, the growth was the size of a coin in late July. Only six months later, it was the size of my fist.
I describe how she sat on the bed, unmoving, the quiet eye in a hurricane of teal scrubs and hushed murmurs. I do not speak Ilonggo, but desperate fear is a universal language. Clearly, her husband was unwilling to pick her up or speak to the doctor.
This story garners the reaction that I subconsciously seek. The audience gasps. Wide eyes meet dropped jaws. Discussions about healthcare inequities and social suffering immediately commence. Previous classes taken and books read are all cited in a public, earnest bid to prove credibility of compassion, of our well-informed and well-intentioned empathy.
It strikes me sometimes, while I’m basking in the glow of the conversation I’ve sparked, that it feels slightly competitive — performative, even. What are we posturing for? How often, when we engage in discourse about suffering, are we discussing what we’re truly indignant about as opposed to what will paint us in the most intellectual, compassionate light?
And what does it say about me, that in the split second I select an anecdote to share, I pander to this particular audience?
***
What I don’t tell people is that I saw the woman with the breast tumor only a day after I saw the stray dog in the park. This is how the story really ends:
I had to leave the patient’s room. Nausea rolled through my gut — not from the oozing, grotesque tumor burned into the back of my eyelids, but from an oppressive, staggering secondhand terror I felt for this woman’s life. I slipped past the curtain and stumbled headlong into a doctor I had been shadowing.
What are her options? My trembling lips could produce neither sound nor syllable. Will she be okay? 
“Oh, baby.” She rubbed my arm. “She’ll try the mastectomy. But we can’t focus too much on her — she knew for months! Since July, she did nothing about it.”
I wanted to rip my hair from its roots. Did she have the money? If so, would her husband let her use it? How close was the nearest hospital? Could she get there? Did she have work, children, bills to pay that seemed more pressing than a lump under her skin she thought she could pray away?
But even harder to chew, let alone swallow: Was the doctor just a little bit right? Even when we’re well-informed and well-intentioned, and in a place of so much need and so few resources, might we need to ration our compassion?
I don’t tell the second half of the story because it isn’t what people want to hear. The nausea and newfound doubt in my capacity to care, just like my five-cent story about a stray puppy, do not belong in the same conversation as the hyperintellectual and performative echo chambers I created by telling the first half.
But that five-cent story is worth more to me than just a belated activation of my tear ducts. It was the climatic epiphany I had so eagerly anticipated all week, the moment I grasped intuitively what I had always known cerebrally. Nothing separated the Shih Tzu from the mutt, except that she was young, and cute, and bred to be sold to a warm home that would take her on long walks and feed her beef-based pellets twice a day; nothing, other than the chance circumstances of birth, separated me from the woman and her tumor.
And I am coming to realize that perhaps I arrived in the Philippines with selfish expectations: to be genuinely moved, yes, but also to leave with a goody-bag of anecdotes, to prove to myself and others that I was genuinely moved — as evidence of both emotional engagement and intellectual mastery over these hefty topics we toss around over drinks at night and brunch the next morning. And in the process of cherry-picking the right stories, I glossed over the only one that actually shook me to my core — a tale of two dogs that wrenched my eyes open wide enough to register human suffering the way I had so hoped and anticipated the rest of my service trip would.
When people ask me about my trip to the Philippines now, I tell them both stories: the mutt in the park and the woman with the tumor. I hope they see that to me, they are the same story. I’m just the other dog.

Lauren H. Yang ’23 was crowned Queen of the Miss Chinatown U.S.A. court in February — though she almost did not compete for the title at all.
“When I was little I was too shy to ask for take out boxes at restaurants,” Yang recalls. When Yang was eleven, her mother pushed her and her sister to participate in pageants — she hoped it would help them overcome their shyness.
Even at eleven, Yang had some misgivings. Popular images of child pageants from shows like ‘Toddlers & Tiaras,’ with “little kids wearing a lot of makeup not having any manners at all,” deterred her from competing. The reality, however, was much more “kid-friendly” than Yang anticipated.
“If you were below thirteen you couldn’t wear makeup,” she explains. “[The pageant organizers] created a community and environment to help you grow that’s completely different from what I saw on TV, which I’m really happy about.”
Though she’s interested in pageantry, classical piano, and visual art, women’s rights activism is the passion nearest to Yang’s heart. Her face lights up when she begins to describe “Girl Up,” a “United Nations Foundation campaign dedicated to women fighting for women and girls.” Yang — who grew up in Sugar Land, Texas — founded a Houston chapter of the campaign. They worked to raise money for girls in Malawi to safely get to school, purchased feminine products for girls in Mexico, and even passed a federal law that prioritizes refugee children’s access to education.
After high school, Yang felt the time had come for another challenge: Miss Chinatown U.S.A. “After I graduated I was like, I might as well do something new this summer,” she says. “I may never have the chance to take the time to do something for myself, so I kind of just went for it.”
Yang, however, had doubts about the pageant whose crown she now holds. Although Yang appreciated the focus on Chinese culture and history, Miss Chinatown U.S.A. had another unique element she found less appealing: a swimsuit competition. As an ardent women’s rights activist in high school, she felt the nature of Miss Chinatown U.S.A. went “completely against everything that [she’d] ever believed in,” particularly in the context of the Miss America 2.0 movement.
“[The Miss America pageant] got rid of the swimsuit competition because of the male gaze and all the connotations of it,” she explains. “I was like, who am I to be putting myself into this when I’m at the same time advocating for women’s rights?”
In fact, according to the event’s website, Miss Chinatown U.S.A. began in 1948 as a “bathing beauty contest” in San Francisco, possibly started by “Chinese-American GI’s...with a habit of looking at pin-ups.” It became the Miss Chinatown U.S.A pageant in 1958, and evolved to include a talent competition, Q&A, and qipao (a traditional Chinese dress) section.
Ultimately, Yang decided to take a “leap of faith.”
“I can’t make a judgment about other people or about this experience until I actually do it for myself,” she says. Despite her initial misgivings, something “clicked” when Yang stepped on stage and felt the outpouring of support from her friends and family.
“I realize now that the whole swimsuit competition is not about wearing a bikini for other people to see,” Yang says. “I think it’s more about choice.”
Before stepping out in front of a million viewers, Yang had never worn a bikini. “The first time was when I tried it on, the second time was tech rehearsal, and the third time was the actual night,” she laughs. “But getting to the point where I was comfortable enough in my own skin was super rewarding, because that was something I struggled with when I was younger.”
Yang also appreciated the pageant’s emphasis on staying connected to Chinese culture. Miss Chinatown U.S.A. coincides with San Francisco’s two-week-long Chinese New Year celebration. After the pageant weekend, Yang and the other members of the court visited Chinatown and businesses run by Chinese Americans or Chinese immigrants. They also saw family associations, groups founded during the Gold Rush. Organized either by last name or ancestral village, they were designed to offer Chinese immigrants a community.
Miss Chinatown U.S.A. offers Yang and the other members of the court a platform to be “goodwill ambassadors for the Chinese community throughout the new year.” Yang hopes to give back to the Boston Chinese community during the school year by volunteering with the Chinatown Citizenship Program.
And yet, Yang noticed the pageant was not just “goodwill.” Miss Chinatown U.S.A. was not immune to the climate surrounding the coronavirus. Viewership dropped from 3 million to 1 million this year, and event organizers had to reassure the media that it was safe to watch the parade. Yet Yang feels the adversity only makes their work more important.
“There’s so much xenophobia and anti-Chinese sentiment going on right now,” she says. The work of Miss Chinatown U.S.A., Yang explains, “is super important in honoring Chinese culture and tradition and making sure people know that where we come from is not what people keep saying it is.”
While her title holds wide-reaching implications, Yang leaves me with a more personal note about her victory’s significance.
After her win at Miss Chinatown U.S.A., Yang walked the streets of San Francisco with her court. They revelled, but it was bittersweet.
“People weren’t really sure who we were because we were wearing the qipaos and sashes and crowns. [I] heard people say, ‘Oh, that’s Miss China’ or ‘that’s Miss Universe,’ but I never once heard ‘oh that’s Miss U.S.A.’ or something American.”
“Growing up, there just wasn’t a lot of Chinese American representation in pageantry,” Yang says. She imagines an America where Miss Chinatown U.S.A. will not be confusing to anybody.
“I think that’s somewhere we’re going towards, but I just wish it was faster,” she says.

If you snake your way through the narrow aisles of energy bars and sodas at Tommy’s Value, you’ll spot it by the cashier’s monitor: a sleek, white device shaped like a pulse oximeter, the kind a nurse might snap onto your index finger during a check-up. A satiny sticker taped to the desk explains that the device does not, in fact, measure your vitals, but your bank account balance. “Pay with your finger,” the blocky, golden font reads, “and get 10% cash back.”
The store owner, Najeeb Hussain, tells me Harvard students Abdul M. Jamjoom ’19, Matteo A. Carroll ’19, and Vojta T. Drmota ’20 developed the device and pitched it to him last fall. The device, Lux Pay, scans a user’s finger veins, links the associated pattern to their bank account, and wires money from that account to the store’s.
The students claimed that the ten percent discount would boost Tommy’s student clientele. Hussain wasn’t sure it would have a significant effect, but agreed to use the technology “mainly to help the kids with their project.” He believes it has great potential for commercial success given its speed and convenience.
“Maybe they’ll develop it and make some money,” he says, smiling.
Drmota believes Lux is an “innovation” capable of disrupting the “inertia of the [payment processing] system.” Its “end-to-end system” bypasses the traditional intermediaries that communicate between a customer’s bank and a store’s bank, eliminating transaction fees and increasing user rewards.
“For many merchants, those fees are the second highest cost after rent,” he claims, adding that he first conceived of Lux after hearing Hussain lament about them.
El Jefe’s Taqueria also uses Lux. Jon H. Eller, the general manager, decided to adopt the payment system out of a mixture of courtesy and intrigue about savings. “They’re customers, you know, loyal fans, and we like supporting students with anything they’re doing,” he explains. “And with them, the [transaction] fees don’t exist.”
But Lux may not be as appealing to customers as it is to business owners. According to Eller, an average day at El Jefe’s sees about two to three users; Hussain estimates an average day at Tommy’s sees only one to two. The business owners say that while some are excited by the novel technology, many are skeptical about its security.
Bruce Schneier, a security technologist and fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, says that biometric payment services like Lux can pose unique threats to privacy. Since “companies can do whatever they want,” businesses can track users’ purchases for targeted advertisement or harness biometric data for surveillance.
Equally worrisome are external breaches of privacy: businesses that store user data in central servers are especially susceptible to cyberattacks from individuals hoping to commit identity fraud. In such cases, Schneier says, “all you can do is be sad; you can lament.”
Yet Lux may not be as prone to the latter concerns as some of its biometric neighbors.
For its pilot stage, the company is using a Japanese vein scanner that is so secure it is used at A.T.M.s in Japan. According to Drmota, the Lux software provides further government-level security, storing its encrypted data in a separate server. A server breach would thus not reveal a user’s identity but instead a meaningless string of characters.
Drmota says his team chose a vein-identification technology over a fingerprint or face scan to protect user privacy and prevent card fraud. Finger vein patterns are difficult to forge, steal, or track. Furthermore, he notes, unlike fingerprints, they are “not forensically admissible” as evidence in a court of law.
While Eller emphasized how secure the device was, he ultimately places the burden of responsibility on users.
“For us, [Lux Pay] is just like any other credit card company,” says Eller. “We don't care if the credit card companies are keeping ‘X’ number of information from people because that's not [our] business.”
Schneier doubts business owners in Harvard Square will have to choose between privacy and convenience, at least for now. “I think, in this system, Apple Pay and Google Pay will win,” he said.“All the other stuff is noise.”
Drmota, however, has high hopes that Lux’s end-to-end payment gate will distinguish it from competitors. Around 210 Harvard students have registered for the device. By the end of the semester, Drmota plans to expand registration and offer the product at other stores in Harvard Square, such as Berryline, Cambridge Cleaners, and Zinneken’s. After graduation, he aims to bring the product to Boston, New York, and L.A.
While some find the novelty of the device off-putting, Drmota believes trust will build with time.
“When people see their friends use it, and see how well it works, they’ll want to be on board,” he said. “From there, you’ll get a snowball effect.”

Every picture of Ian and Rex is glorious and yet each picture is the same. Social media has bestowed upon the masses the power to curate a self that is impressive and magnificent. Glory, it seems, is pretty generic nowadays. But Ian Spear and Rex Woodbury, an Instafamous gay couple, are particularly good at glory.
Just look at their Instagram. In one photo, they’re wearing royal blue suits and sipping what appear to be mojitos from striped paper straws. They have the same haircut and the same pretty American teeth. They have plucked eyebrows, which don’t make them look feminine so much as clean-cut — their strong jawlines and self-assured poses let us know the men we’re looking at are, without question, men. In one photo, they’re picnicking with gourmet food on the Seine; in another, posted two weeks later, they’re swimming in Italy. Looking at these photos, it’s hard not to be astonished by their bodies: the miraculous shoulder-to-waist ratios, Ian’s Ken-doll abs, Rex’s biceps, which threaten to rip through whatever shirt he’s wearing. In photos, they hike at sunset, go to Equinox, and drink smoothies. Their Instagram shows a prim life full of self-discipline, productivity, and predictable escapades. In one post, Ian stands in front of a coffee shop, smiling widely, legs close together, thumbs looped over his backpack straps. There’s an eagerness in his expression, like he’s trying his hardest to be the best boy in the world.
Ian Spear and Rex Woodbury are one of many couples who have landed thousands of followers and dozens of sponsorships on Instagram for being hot and gay. Urban Dictionary defines an “Instagay” not as any gay guy on Instagram, but rather those gay guys who become famous on the social media platform for being “attractive, fun, rich, outgoing, happy, and confident.” The rest of the Instagays are basically indistinguishable from Ian and Rex. They’re predominantly white, in their mid-twenties, and have a penchant for oversaturating their photos. They all live in California and have chiseled faces and bodies.
Instagays’ self-presentation is clearly homosexual, but not necessarily feminine. Chris Lin and Brock Williams, who run the Instagram account “Yummertime,” wear skimpy, effeminate clothing — but then pose with legs spread widely, thumbs in pockets, arms folded across the chest, bodies leaning cockily against a wall. Effeminacy on gay Instagram serves to affirm masculinity: Being in touch with one’s feminine side is evidence of confidence in one’s manhood. As feminist theorist Marilyn Frye writes in The Politics of Reality, “gay male affectation of femininity is a serious sport in which men may exercise their power and control over the feminine.” The Instagays give us not so much a performance of effeminacy as a mastery over it.
Gay Instagram is, basically, an arms race of self-refinement. Instagrays are constantly outdoing one another, not just with perfect photos or perfect relationships but with perfection itself. They try to make the concept of perfection real through filters and premeditated picnic displays, the baguette and the wine placed just so. The result, as everyone strives toward the same Platonic ideal, is a generic sameness. Even each boyfriend in each couple is the same. He is the same height as his partner, has the same coloring, the same body type, even the same amount of body hair. The boyfriends share clothes and seem to shave their faces on the same days of the week. This ensures that these men are framed not as objects of desire or an ideal to be aspired to but, as if hatched by a mastermind, that they are framed as both. “Be perfect like me, so you can have perfect me,” these accounts seem to say.
***
I started following gay couples on Instagram my junior year of high school, around the time I became obsessed with my body. I had my first kiss at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s that year. Losing weight seemed a way to gain more romantic and sexual experiences. The right body, however, also seemed to be an end in and of itself. It seemed, to me, like a staple of the good life.
I followed many Instagay couples, but I became obsessed with Ian and Rex. I pinned my hopes and fears to them. They weren’t just hot and fit. They had gone to Ivy Leagues.
At seventeen, the only thing I cared about more than my body was, it’s sad to say, Harvard. Ian and Rex had graduated from Yale and Dartmouth respectively, and the Ivy League was thematized in their Instagram photos. Not just in the obvious ways of taking kitschy photos in front of Yale’s library, but in more subtle ways: their clean crew cuts, their weekend trips to Manhattan, their button-down shirts and white tennis sneakers.
Ian and Rex not only did the Ivy League but they did it the way you’re supposed to. They each graduated Phi Beta Kappa; Ian worked at McKinsey and Rex at Goldman; and the couple recently founded Worthy Mentoring, an online platform that connects struggling members of the LGBTQ community with mentors. Rex currently holds a Knight-Hennessy scholarship (“It’s Stanford’s version of a Rhodes — I want one so bad,” a senior explained to me) as well the Guinness World Record for fastest half-marathon run in a suit. They’re Pete Buttigieg, but hot.
They, like a lot of gay men, are really good at doing the thing. Often, I’ve felt that gay cis-men here at Harvard are the best at doing the Harvard thing. They’re enabled in the same ways their straight counterparts are, but have more self-awareness. They’re confident and sometimes cocky, assured that they can achieve greatness. But, unlike a lot of straight men here, they’re never complacent, never assured that they already have achieved greatness. There’s a smoothness to them: good grades, good bodies, good clubs, good parties, good friends, good life. They’re what we’re told to be during Convocation: well-rounded. It’s like “Queer Eye,” but the gays have turned in on themselves and this lifestyle makeover goes on in perpetuity. Self-refinement doesn’t rest.
***
“I first heard the word ‘gay’ as an insult in grade school,” Rex says in a video about coming out. He then goes on to list his numerous high school accomplishments, saying that, despite all of that, “I still felt inferior. I hated myself for being attracted to men.” The video then zooms in on Rex’s eyes, which are beautiful and green and full of intensity. “I told my dad that I was gay, that I was scared of being gay, of being less than perfect,” he says. “I always wanted to be a man like my dad and my brother. I think I’m getting there.”
Rex narrates his gayness as a fall from manhood. Perfection, for Rex, is a way to return to that manhood. It’s compensation for his homosexuality. Rex’s father and brother were born men and remain men — Rex is “getting there.” This type of story is why therapists believe perfectionism is endemic in gay men: The shame and stigma of having to come out of the closet makes gay men determined to prove themselves against traditional standards of success.
I’m not so sure about that, though. As Masha Gessen spelled out in a recent New Yorker article on the queer opposition to Pete Buttigieg, not every gay person has to come out of the closet — gayness can sometimes be visible. Not everyone can blend. And not everyone wants to. “There are people who revel in their specialness from an early age,” Gessen writes.
I’ve always been one of those people. I never had to come out of a closet. My gayness never felt like a hurdle I had to jump over. Whereas Rex pushed aside his gayness, dismissing it as a flaw, I had no choice but to pick my gayness up and embrace it as something that could benefit me.
Most often, I used gayness to strive toward perfection. This perfection looked feminine: I wanted skinny and toned arms like a Pilates mom, wanted my hair to fall in Shirley Temple ringlets, wanted to be polite and pleasant, wanted neat handwriting and pretty prose. Everything I did, saying something smart in class or starring in the school play, felt important and heroic because I was doing it as a gay kid. I was constantly narrativizing my life. I liked my gayness because it was something I could engage with intellectually, because it blessed me with good taste, because it seemed to provide me with a self-consciousness that said, no matter what, I could always be better. My differences from my straight peers gave me a curiosity about myself, allowing me to find flaws and adjust them accordingly.
I don’t follow Ian and Rex on Instagram anymore. I unfollowed them pretty much as soon as I got to Harvard. When the Ivy League lost its mystique, so did Ian and Rex. I met gay men just like them — every strand of hair gelled into place, button-down shirt or J. Crew sweater tucked into straight-legged jeans, Saturday nights spent at The Fox, the evening documented on Instagram in garishly filtered photos — and I found the whole thing kind of corny. I realized quickly that I didn’t want to work at a consulting company, would never enter the weight room in the MAC, would never join a final club. I would write personal essays, move into a co-op, and buy a pair of clogs. I would strive toward a different conception of a perfect gay man, one who, in his casual quirkiness, is ostensibly indifferent to perfection.
Still, I thought about Ian and Rex often. Sometimes I would search them on Instagram, to see how sunny and healthy their new life in San Francisco was. If I was feeling fat, I’d look at pictures of Ian at the beach. I wondered about our similarities and differences, felt inexplicably cheated that the same thing could motivate us to be such different people. I felt a gnawing about all of this, and looking at their Instagram made it temporarily go away before making it rush back violently.
***
There are two online chat rooms, hosted by the gay internet forum DataLounge, that are dedicated to hating Ian Spear and Rex Woodbury. The thing people hate most about Ian and Rex is how perfect they are. The couple gets referred to as “boy scouts”' and “golden boys'' and “the Stepford gays.” Sometimes people express their hatred for Ian and Rex’s perfectionism through femme-shaming. Even if the perfect form being strived for is a masculine one, perfectionism — that detail-oriented and self-conscious thing, constantly requiring you to be attuned to what others want from you — is a feminine trait. “These two guys are attractive but too perfect (it seems they try to have eeevery small thing in place), it reminds me of a gay classmate I had who always wanted everything to be perfect,” one user wrote. “Fucking annoying.”
Between the two chat rooms, there are 672 replies and essentially all of them express the same desire: to see something human from Ian and Rex. But almost always this desire to see Ian and Rex’s humanity is expressed through berating them. People trash talk them and insult them and pick them apart, all for being too perfect. It’s self-defeating, though, this critiquing of perfection. It creates the very problem it aims to solve. It fuels the same demand to self-refine that caused Ian and Rex’s perfection in the first place. After you’ve read all 672 replies, the message is clear: No matter what, even when you’re perfect, you can always be better.
To get famous on Instagram requires more than just beauty and skillful editing. It requires discipline and exhibition. You need to have control over your body, your surroundings, your clothes, your friends, every little detail of your lifestyle. And then you need to know how to present that life in a way that will elicit desire and disdain, that will make people feel both envious and appreciative. Who better at all this than gay men? They get to partake in creating the ridiculously high standards they’re subjected to.
The only flaw that the men in the Data Forum chat room identify in the couple belongs only to Ian, not Rex. Apparently, according to a video Ian made and then uploaded online, he has major gay voice. “If I had to choose, I would say Rex is the hotter of the two. Mostly because when Ian speaks, a purse falls out,” one user writes. “Ian’s voice just sounds generically feminine,” another states matter-of-factly. Sometimes gay male effeminacy isn’t affected. Sometimes it’s not a mastery of femininity, but a surrender to it. Gay voice isn’t chosen, it just is.
I have gay voice. It’s one of the few parts of being gay I haven’t gotten comfortable with. Maybe it’s because I rarely hear my own voice. “Do I sound gay?” I’ll ask people out-of-the-blue sometimes, hoping that this time the answer won’t be yes. Maybe it’s because there’s nothing advantageous about it — like most abnormalities of speech, it just makes me sound less intelligent. Or maybe it’s just because it’s totally beyond my control. When I read that Ian had gay voice, though, I desperately wanted to hear him speak. I could imagine it. It made sense why he would be the one with the feminine voice: He had the smaller frame, the higher hair, the more earnest smile. When they pose together, Ian always looks like he’s slightly more encouraging of Rex, more doting and devoted. I wanted to hear Ian’s voice because I wanted the flash of recognition I’ve never gotten from his Instagram. Maybe then the gnawing would finally go away. I wished that I had his phone number so that I could hear his voice and he could hear mine and we could invest something, anything, in one another. I looked desperately for the video that the men in the chat rooms were talking about. After reading through almost all 672 responses, I finally found the link to the video in which Ian speaks. I clicked on it, but I was redirected to a white screen and a message telling me the video had been taken down by the user.

A cup of water and a swinging elbow rarely make a good pair. But in the case of Leverett Dining Hall, they’re a particularly daunting duo.
Most non-Leverites don’t understand the difficulty of eating in a dining hall without easy access to napkins. Freshmen, too, would be shocked at the state of the Leverett Dining Hall — Annenberg has two napkin dispensers on every table, while I can usually only find two in all of the Leverett Dhall.
I’m sure that when Charles H. Coons invented the napkin dispenser in 1928, his intention was to make napkins more accessible — not less.
Which brings me to my main argument: Why are there no napkin dispensers on the tables in Lev Dhall?
***
It’s hard to think of reasons to deprive students of napkins: budget cuts? A napkin shortage? To make my life harder? The general, unproven rumor around Leverett is that, “It’s better for the environment.”
I would like to challenge this defense.
First: Is it even true? Does hiding the napkin dispensers in obscure places around the dining hall really discourage people from using them? When you spill your Lime Dasani sparkling water, for example, you’re going to grab a napkin to clean it up. If your face gets covered in spaghetti sauce, you’re not just going to leave it there — you’ll find your damn napkins, wherever they are, and wipe your marinara-stained face. And when pieces of your HUDS Sloppy Joe slip from between their bun and slide onto your backpack, what do you think you’ll use to wipe up those bad boys? A bouillon spoon? A napkin, of course.
Second: Could placing napkin holders away from the tables in the largest upperclassmen dining hall have an adverse effect on this rumored goal? For a friend of mine, this is exactly what happens: Rather than use the few napkins he needs, he takes an abhorrent amount (10, 15, 20 — it depends on the day) before even sitting down, just in case his Sloppy Joe ends up on his backpack.
Third: If this method really makes such a difference, why are the other ten houses not doing it? Are you reading this, Greta Thunberg? It seems a bit odd that this “environmentally-friendly” policy is not implemented in the other houses. You know it’s a bad idea when other houses decide not to implement it — just look at the recently-scrapped “Incest Fest” in Kirkland.
Fourth: During Energy Week 2019, Leverett House ranked last out of the 12 houses in the overall percent reduction of energy, citing a 7.61 percent increase in energy for this allotted week in November. This, of course, raises an important question: Are the majority of Leverett House residents really all that dedicated to reducing waste and saving energy? And if not, who took away our napkins?
***
I can’t logically understand how rationing napkin dispensers will do anything except inconvenience Leverett House diners.
Look, I get it: Maybe this is just a me-problem. After all, I never attended an Elizabethan etiquette class, so perhaps I’m just naturally more prone to knocking over a drink or accidentally overfilling my cereal bowl.
But then again, there’s no way everyone else eats meals with their pinky up and their elbows off the table. If reading this article stirs something resonant within your being, you know where to find me.
I’m not entirely sure why our napkins are gone, but if I’m being honest, I truly don’t care. I just want them back.

It is a trope in popular and academic writing alike to say that the absence of a precise definition of “Asian America” is what binds the identity together — that Asian Americans lack not only a literal common language, but also a common “language” in terms of a unifying ideology through which we can better understand each other.
Yet as I walked into the Lowell Junior Common Room on Friday evening, I was overwhelmed not by absence, but by abundance. Nearly 100 Harvard students, mostly Asian-presenting, sat on sofas, tables, and the floor. They jostled for sushi, a samosa, or bubble tea. Their eyes were absorbed in slim booklets of 8.5 by 5.5 inch glossy sheets, each 50 pages in total — copies of the inaugural issue of The Wave, Harvard’s first Asian anglophone arts magazine.
The cover of the magazine is a digital drawing of a wave, grey-blue water crashing onto a muted tan beach and a hazel eye emerging from the wave’s face, alluding to the famous print, titled “The Great Wave off Kanagawa.” Within its pages is a breathtaking kaleidoscope of Asian American art, 16 pieces I can’t get out of my mind: a portrait with pink and green and yellow hues overlayed on top of creamy skin, fractured lines and Chinese calligraphy imprinting on and haunting the canvas; a poem about gender whose words bend into the shape of a stem of bayog, the species of bamboo from which the term bayoguin, the pre-Hispanic Filipino term for third-gender people, derives; the reflections of an Indian American woman who grew up in Tucson on land stolen from another type of “Indian,” the Tohono O’odham people.
These are the languages — complex and overlapping, at once opaque and unambiguous — from which Asian America emerges. Bound together by a front and back cover, glue, and the tireless efforts of about a dozen undergraduates, they cohere.
***
I first met Jerrica Li ’21 and Eric Zhou ’20, The Wave’s co-founders, in the Smith Campus Center a couple of days earlier to discuss their vision for the magazine, but I also hoped that they could help me decode an Asian American language. I recognize that a single magazine cannot represent Asian America at Harvard, just as Asian America at Harvard cannot represent Asian America writ-large. Yet from this identity’s political inception in the late 1960s, art and culture have played a central role in shaping an Asian American consciousness. I hoped The Wave, a return to Asian America’s roots, might provide a bit of clarity.


Only a few months ago, it was unclear whether the magazine would come together at all. “There was a moment in the fall semester where it was literally just me and Jerrica sitting in a dining hall wondering, ‘Should this move forward?,’” Zhou said to the crowd at the launch event. Driven by the belief that Harvard’s Asian American community needed a platform for artistic expression, they persisted, amassing a small team that has worked tirelessly over the past several months to bring this project to fruition.
“The magazine that you hold in your hands, that’s a wave of love,” Li said. “We’re so glad that you’re here today to affirm that it should exist, and that it does exist.” Before she finished speaking, the room erupted into cheers and applause.
Indeed, the magazine’s opening message strikes a tone somewhere between a manifesto and a love letter, declaring that The Wave doesn’t seek to outline a single Asian experience, but rather to celebrate the identity’s multiplicity. The magazine’s name itself is a reappropriation of the phrase “a wave of immigrants,” transforming the term from a homogenizing expression of prejudice to a statement of radical community-building. It reads, “We are a flourishing movement creating art that speaks to our age, our race, our histories and our communities in the here and now.”
After Li and Zhou finished their opening remarks, two faculty members who were instrumental to the project — English Professor Ju Yon Kim, who studies Asian American literature and performance, and Eleanor Craig, who directs the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights — gave short speeches, followed by a surprise gift to the co-founders from the rest of the team. Spontaneous applause, cries of “We love you!”, laughter and, on occasion, tears punctuated the opening remarks.
But when the Open Mic started, with a reading from the magazine, there was total stillness, the room’s vibrance funneled into serious, unflinching attention.
***
Just over a year ago, I was crowded into another common room in Winthrop House, with about the same number of Asian American students sitting on benches, the floor, and window sills. We were there for a discussion forum titled, “The Role of Asian Cultural Organizations on Campus,” hosted by some of the largest of these groups, including the Asian American Association and Chinese Students Association.
The room’s atmosphere, at first filled with light discussion and the oily smell of Chinese take-out, quickly turned vitriolic. Some criticized the overrepresentation of East Asians in purportedly pan-Asian spaces.Asian American students involved with campus activism attacked more socially-oriented groups like AAA and CSA for being apolitical. Defenses ranged from pointing to the impossibility of uniting all Asian Americans’ diverse political ideologies, to arguing that a social space is as important as a political one, to highlighting these affinity groups’ volunteer efforts. I left exhausted and disillusioned, but the discussion was far from over.
In November, the Asian American Womxn’s Association penned “An Open Letter to the Asian American Community,” calling out several Asian American student organizations for not co-sponsoring a set of demonstrations in support of DACA and TPS. The letter garnered hundreds of signatures, but also received intense backlash about what a political imperative for Asian America might entail, renewing tensions from last spring.
This cacophony echoes endlessly. A paralyzing fear of bitter argument lingers over any conversation I have with an Asian American friend at Harvard that veers, even slightly, toward the political.
I have always believed that there is some ineffable substance binding Asian America together. I signed AAWA’s letter because what such a diverse group as Asian America shares cannot be some static culture, but rather a recognition of interrelated struggles and circumstances. I believe this commonality produces a culture that is political in claim to or categorization as “Asian American,” even if its artistic content is not explicitly so.
I consider he radical and unifying act of coining the term “Asian America” in 1968, the Ethnic Studies protests igniting Harvard’s campus, the love of — or at least attention paid to — “The Farewell” and “Crazy Rich Asians” and “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before,” and I can’t help feeling that a core thread must exist.
Yet the past year has shaken my faith, making me wonder whether popular Asian American writers’ proclamations — Jay Caspian Kang declaring, “nobody goes on pilgrimages back to their motherland of Asian-America” in The New York Times Magazine — are correct. Perhaps Asian America does not exist; or if it does, perhaps it is not to be found at Harvard.
***
Li and Zhou envisioned The Wave as an open space for Asian anglophone art. The term “Asian anglophone,” they explained, was intended to make their call for submissions “as broad as possible.” Rather than asking for pieces about identity, they invited anyone with a relationship to Asia who spoke English


Hearing this vision of radical inclusivity, I couldn’t help voice some of my uncertainties: If the scope of the magazine is so broad, what holds it together? Despite using “Asian anglophone” in their submission call, our conversation centered around “Asian America.” So how did they define Asian American art? How did they go about pinpointing “Asian America” — as a geography, an identity, a product of overlapping structures?
“We didn’t come in with assumptions about what Asian America is,” Li said. “We came in creating a space and being open — always open — to amazement at what came in.”
At first, the abstractness of their answers, which danced around concrete labels and definitions, was frustrating. Now that I’ve seen the magazine, however, I think I understand. The art within is anything but non-committal.
I flip through the thick, smooth pages, text and images laid over pastel-colored geometrical patterns resembling tree rings, fingerprints, cloth. I open to “Clown Kiss,” a painting of a parent and child, heads bulbous and exaggerated eyes shut, faces and bodies reduced to fields of color: baby blues, fleshy pinks, tulip yellows.
A few pages later is “comfort,” a poem arranged in four columns that focuses on the Korean women who were sexually enslaved by Japanese soldiers: “when I seek comfort / in my husband’s arms / now I think of / the white rice ball / Shimura-san left me.”
The Wave does not have a single definition of Asian America, nor a single politics that it is dedicated to. But each individual work is dedicated to its own, internal message. Each is an instantiation of not only Asian America, but also of an individual’s vision. And from the collective emerges the magazine, a whole body with commitments to expression and beauty, to internal ambivalence as well as unity. These 16 pieces, in constellation and conversation with one another, form a collective instantiation of Asian America.
Perhaps Asian America need not be such a rigorously-defined mode of classification; perhaps, at a single moment in space and time, Asian America emerges, an ever-shifting wave of voices.
“What brings it together?” Li continued, her pace slow and methodical. “We didn’t answer that question.” She paused. “The artists answered that question.”
***
The other thing weighing on my mind was more explicitly political: How did they situate The Wave within Asian American campus politics?
“At the end of the day it’s also just a book of work — beautiful, beautiful works of art by people who wanted that space and have it,” Li said. “And that’s how it should be enjoyed as well, on that level.”
Yet the magazine exists on two levels: as a collection of individual works of art, and as a vision for Harvard’s first Asian American literary and arts magazine. I thought of AAWA’s letter and call to action — to exist as a person of color in the United States, to claim the label Asian American, is always already to invoke politics. Before I could say anything, the co-founders were several steps ahead of me.
“What’s inherently political about it, on a metalevel, is its existence, that we say this should exist — that’s a political statement,” Li said. “What’s political about it is that it decided to exist and that it wasn’t just us two dreaming in a room — like, it happened.”
Her words reminded me of a piece I reported last spring, on the origins of an Asian American consciousness on Harvard’s campus in the 1970s. Then, there were so few Asian-identifying students on campus that the very act of gathering, of sharing art and food and laughter, was political.
“Literature adds a different kind of voice to the discourse. One that is not harsh, one that does not need to shout the loudest,” Li said. “With literature, you add a voice that requires — demands — your attention, but a different kind of contemplation, a different kind of empathy. And honestly, an incredible amount of nuance.”
An Asian American community exists at Harvard, splintered and exhausted, vibrant and emergent. Like The Wave, it is imperfect — a “baby,” Li said. Nonetheless, “we tried really hard to do justice to the voices, because the artists were most important to us.” And they hope The Wave, where past Asian American publications have puttered out, will extend indefinitely — with more issues, expanding to more mediums, and publishing more work online.
Like The Wave, the act of gathering — of collecting 16 works of Asian anglophone work within 50 pages, of drawing roughly 100 Asian Americans into the Lowell Junior Common Room on a Friday night — is politics.

I follow a path of freshly plucked rose petals into the dim, mood-lit basement of Elks Lodge in Central Square. “Adicto Del Rock” by the Mexican garage-rock band Las Ultrasónicas blasts in the background, and the sweet, slightly piercing scent of IPA beer wafts into my nose. Pivoting away from the hustle of Massachusetts Avenue, my friend and I make our way toward the bi-monthly art and flea market of Boston Hassle, a volunteer collective that showcases the work of independent and underrepresented creative scenes in the greater Boston area.
I step into the flea market as some of the vendors set up shop. The market consists of two floors, vendor tables neatly arranged into concentric squares in each one. Sophie L. Yarin, the editor-in-chief of Boston Hassle, told me in our interview the day before that the flea market has “a mission of affordable art by people, for the people.” It is supposed to provide a space where you can buy things “made by, you know, your friend, your barista, the person next to you on the T.”
The lodge is full of eccentric stands, ranging from vintage resale clothing racks — where I find a red auto repair shop coverall tagged “VINTAGE WORK JACKET FOR WRENCHIN’ ON YA CAH” — to myriad independent artists selling their work. Vendors peddle screenprints, acrylic pour canvas paintings, repainted vinyl records, and an infinite variety of earrings: leather, upcycled metal, various loose singlets. “It’s a created space that allows us to, again, create a small measure of the sort of metaphysical infrastructure,” Yarin says. “It’s regenerative.”
Before I interview Sharon A. Crowley of Handsome Hobo Neckwear — a small business that sells ties, bowties, and ascots made by Sharon’s husband, Rick Crowley — I meet their “Director of HR” Kiwi Mermaid Crowley, a black pug in a fashion-forward get-up. (There is also a baby Yoda outfit behind the table.)
After speaking with Sharon about water filters, slurpees, and dogs sensing cancer, and with Rick about how their business grew out of him serendipitously selling his bowtie during a job interview, they gift me with a handmade ascot: black-and-white with skeletal anatomy patterns on one side and red vertical stripes on the other. When I ask why they chose Hassle, they agree, “We liked the art vendors and wanted to become part of the community.”
Publisher of Boston Hassle Dan J. Shea says he hopes the collective is a space “where young artists, where experimental artists, where boundary-pushing artists can do their work, where they can stumble and fall and get back up again and try more. We're where people can learn to become the great artists that we want to see coming out of Boston.”
Yarin says that, for her, part of Hassle’s value lies in “the way we show Boston in all its trashy, shitty, hardscrabble glory.”
“We're getting gobbled up — this town's getting gobbled up by rich condos and corporations,” Shea says. What frustrates him is that “these towns are so broken politically, and being broken politically is stifling and snuffing out these creative people from being able to live here.”
Hassle is creating a “fertile breeding ground for getting folks involved,” and that the “market is a place where a bunch of scenes come together,” Shea says.“These kinds of scenes are places where there's a political latency that is just waiting to be stirred. They just need the right person, situation, something to happen to them or their friend, for the fire to light up.”
With hopes to eventually set up a brick-and-mortar building from which they can promote their art and music shows, operate their website and publication, and even potentially host the bi-monthly flea market, Boston Hassle feels destined to establish themselves as a “third space,” as Shea would call it.
“You live somewhere, you work somewhere, and then there's the third space,” Shea says. “This is where you go and spend your time. And you spend your social life there. You go there for fun, you go with friends.” This, ultimately, is Shea’s mission: “the business of creating third spaces.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 30 students from the Harvard School of Public Health gathered at the Longwood campus for a night of painting in a bid to give students a mental health break Wednesday evening.
Sarah E. Zelasky, vice president of student life for the Harvard Chan Student Association, said she helped organize the event “hoping to not only have students have like a mental health break from their studies, but to also form some friendships while they’re here.”
“Our school focuses a lot on academia, and that we also are a community, and it’s really important for us to remember that and provide more opportunities for people to hang out and get together,” said Zelasky.
Sina Famenini, vice president of student advocacy for the HCSA, said he believes this event is especially important during the winter.
“Winter is isolating and the days are short and people are inside all day, so if we have to be inside, we might as well bring people together for a fun event addressing mental health and loneliness through art,” Famenini said.
Caroline D. Keroack, a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, guided the participants through painting the Boston skyline, but encouraged them to paint whatever they wished.
She said the event attempted to provide a welcome break from an otherwise stressful school environment.
“It’s very hard, in like an academic world, where there’s a right answer and a wrong answer, and sort of with painting there’s no right answer and wrong answer,” Keroack said. “I’m hoping that it gives them a break from whatever homework, classes, or exams. When I paint, afterwards I feel much lighter.”
The event was HCSA’s first planned mental health break for the student body at the School of Public Health.
Hui Fen “Rachel” Lim, who participated in the art self-care night, said that she “had never really assessed” available mental health services.
“I wish we had more events like this,” Lim said.
According to Zelasky, the event and the waitlist had been completely filled, showing the demand for events like these.
“It’s a good way to de-stress and kind of do something that you don’t normally get to do,” Archna A. Patel, who attended the event, said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate professor Elizabeth K. Hinton will depart for Yale this summer after six years in Harvard’s History and African and African American Studies departments, during which she produced high-profile scholarship on racial inequality and poverty.
Beginning July 1, Hinton will hold tenured appointments in the history and African American studies departments of Yale’s faculty of arts and sciences, as well as a secondary appointment at Yale Law School. Dean of Yale Law School Heather K. Gerken announced the move in an email to Yale Law students Wednesday afternoon.
A rising star in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Hinton is a preeminent scholar in mass incarceration, most notably publishing the award-winning 2016 book “From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America.”
She said in an interview with The Crimson that Yale reached out to her with an offer of the tenured appointment last spring, though she did not actively apply for a job there. After she learned of Yale’s proposal, she began the tenure review process at Harvard and was also granted tenure at Harvard’s FAS in the fall, she said.
Hinton said the choice to make the move to New Haven was “not an easy” one, but she ultimately felt Yale would be a better fit for her family and a better environment to advance her scholarship.
“I am saddened by leaving behind so many colleagues who I treasure dearly here, but this decision felt like the right one for me and for my family in this moment,” Hinton said.
She added that the appointment at Yale Law School was a “major factor” in her decision.
“The opportunity to be a part of the faculty at Yale Law School, I think is really important in terms of the moment that we’re in right now in confronting issues of racism in the criminal justice system, and considering new pathways for reform,” Hinton said. “Yale provides me a new kind of platform and I think an important one for my scholarship moving forward.”
Hinton will also join Yale’s Justice Collaboratory, which brings together scholars from a variety of fields to study criminal justice reform.
Though Hinton’s departure comes amid increased scrutiny of Harvard’s tenure processes — particularly of its retention and promotion of faculty who study race and ethnicity — Hinton said that recent controversies did not affect her decision, given that she had received tenure at both institutions.
“Tenure was not a part of my decision,” Hinton said, adding that recent ethnic studies advocacy likewise played no role in her move.
Hinton said she was a “target of opportunity hire,” meaning Yale created a position for her specifically rather than conducting a broad-based faculty search.
“The Law School had expressed interest in hiring me and that’s what led to the creation of my position,” she said.
FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on Hinton’s departure.
Gerken wrote in an email to The Crimson that she is looking forward to welcoming Hinton to the ranks of Yale Law’s faculty.
“Yale Law School has a remarkable group of legal historians and scholars of criminal justice as well as the Justice Collaboratory, which is a magnet for academics across the University,” Gerken wrote. “Professor Hinton is one of the finest historians of her generation, and her work is deeply connected to our faculty’s.”
“We could not be happier that she will be joining our intellectual community,” Gerken added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Department of Justice asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to overturn the October 2019 case ruling which found that Harvard College does not discriminate against Asian Americans in its admissions process.
Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband filed an amicus brief alongside three other Justice Department officials in support of the plaintiff in the case — anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions — one week after SFFA appealed the ruling.
The Justice Department argued in its brief that a district court judge failed to apply strict scrutiny in determining whether Harvard’s use of race in its admissions process was “narrowly tailored to a compelling interest.” It also defended SFFA’s allegations that Harvard engages in “racial balancing” when admitting students and systematically penalizes Asian American applicants.
The officials also argued that the Department has a vested interest in the case because of its role in combatting discrimination and scrutinizing organizations that receive money from the federal government.
“The United States enforces multiple statutes that prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations, housing, voting, education, and employment, among other contexts,” the brief reads. “As particularly relevant here, the United States distributes billions of dollars in federal financial assistance every year, and it has a significant interest in ensuring that recipients of such assistance comply with Title VI’s antidiscrimination mandate.”
In an emailed statement, SFFA president Edward J. Blum praised the Justice Department’s intervention in the case.
“Students for Fair Admissions is grateful the U.S. Department of Justice has formally recognized that Harvard’s admissions policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants,” Blum wrote. “DOJ’s amicus brief accurately highlights the emails, depositions, internal studies, data analysis and testimony that SFFA presented to the district court to prove that Harvard’s admissions policies are discriminatory.”
The Justice Department’s brief comes as the latest part of litigation that has been pending against Harvard for several years. SFFA initially filed its lawsuit against Harvard in November 2014. Last October, District court Judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled in Harvard’s favor and found that the College does not discriminate against Asian American applicants.
Economists and several legal organizations also submitted amicus briefs supporting SFFA and opposing the district court ruling. Those groups include Mountain States Legal Foundation, Judicial Watch, and the National Association of Scholars, among others.
The Asian American Coalition for Education and the Asian American Legal Foundation also submitted a brief, which lists the names of nearly 300 Asian American organizations as supporters.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the amicus briefs.
The brief marks the second time the Justice Department has previously supported SFFA in its lawsuit against Harvard.
Separately, the Department led its own investigation into alleged discrimination in Harvard admissions, which was confirmed as ongoing in December 2019.
Harvard is scheduled to submit its brief in the case by May 14.

The Harvard Management Company bought stock in Uber, decreased its shares in Facebook, and slightly lowered its overall securities value in the last quarter of 2019, per the University’s latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC requires investment managers who oversee over $100 million to disclose their securities holdings each quarter.
HMC purchased 1.8 million shares in the ride-hailing company — equivalent to $53.5 million in holdings — which went public in May 2019.
It also slightly reduced its overall securities value to $945 million this quarter after doubling the previous value to $1.07 billion last quarter. Still, the securities represent a relatively small percentage of Harvard’s endowment, which was valued at $40.9 billion in 2019.
HMC also bought nearly 3 million shares in NuCana Plc, a cancer-focused biopharmaceutical company. That figure amounts to around 9 percent of the company’s total shares, per another form Harvard filed with the SEC. The SEC requires companies to disclose stock ownership above 5 percent.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on the filings, citing HMC's policy not to comment on individual investments.
“HMC does not comment on specific investments,” McKiernan wrote in an email.
HMC also decreased its total shares in Facebook and Palo Alto Networks, selling 30 percent of its shares in Palo Alto Networks and nearly 40 percent of its shares in Facebook. The value of Harvard’s holdings in Facebook dropped from over $400 million to $283 million in the last quarter.
Additionally, it sold all of its shares in two companies: 43,000 shares of the software company Adobe Systems and 640,000 shares of the biopharmaceutical company Aduro Biotech.
Stephen T. Isaacs, the CEO of Aduro Biotech, said Gerald L. Chan — a major donor to the University — gifted Harvard around 7 million shares in the company. Isaacs estimated that Harvard received the gift around “a year and a half or two years ago.”
Chan, a member of Aduro Biotech’s board of directors from 2014 to 2018, did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday night.
Isaacs said that Harvard has been selling the shares gradually since Chan gifted them.
“We appreciate that they didn't sell it all at once,” Isaacs said. “I think most academic institutions have a policy of, when they get shares, they sell them and take the cash and do whatever they're going to do. But this was a large gift — I think it was seven million shares or so — and so Harvard's been titrating it out over time.”
Isaacs said he was happy to hear that Harvard had sold the last of its shares in Aduro Biotech.
“I am glad the selling is done. In biotech we never like to see somebody sell large blocks of shares. It's challenging,” he said. “We wish Harvard well with the proceeds, using it for whatever they use it for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Institute of Politics Wednesday, Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, discussed the importance of intersectionality in her work and how she thinks the movement should continue after recent verdicts against Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein.
At the beginning of the event, Burke received a standing ovation after being awarded the Harvard Kennedy School’s Alan Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award.
Ambassador Wendy R. Sherman, Kennedy School professor and director of the Center for Public Leadership, moderated both the conversation with Burke and a discussion with audience members.
During the discussion, Burke reflected on Weinstein, whose alleged sexual misconduct fueled the #MeToo movement in 2017. On Monday, a jury found Weinstein — a movie executive whom more than 100 women have accused of sexual harassment and abuse — guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and third degree rape. He was acquitted of first degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault.
“There’s a lot of excitement in the air right now — some renewed energy after this Weinstein verdict, which I’m going to comment on, because we have a lot of work to do,” Burke said after receiving the award. “But I am really grateful for where we are.”
Burke founded the #MeToo movement in 2006, while working at Just Be Inc., her nonprofit that focuses on supporting young women of color. She coined the phrase “me too” as a statement supporting people who have experienced sexual assault.
In 2017, the New York Times broke a story documenting decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Weinstein. Soon after the story was published, actress Alyssa J. Milano began using the #MeToo hashtag. Hundreds of people began sharing their own stories of sexual misconduct using the hashtag.
That fall, Burke’s movement — over a decade old — suddenly emerged in the spotlight. At the discussion, Burke acknowledged that the Weinstein verdict “is not an indictment of #MeToo.” She said the movement “is about catharsis” and “healing.”
“Justice looks different for everyone and survivors don’t think punitively,” Burke said. “We want healing.”
Burke also discussed differences between society’s response to women of color and white women who experience sexual assault.
“Whether — white men, black men, black women — we have been socialized to respond to the vulnerability of white women,” Burke said. “And because of that, we put aside so many things, and we push forward.”
In the question portion of the forum, Lovern J. Gordon — founder of Love Life Now, a nonprofit to support people who have experienced domestic abuse — asked how to bring more people, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, into the #MeToo movement.
Burke stressed that providing resources to marginalized groups who may have felt disconnected from the mainstream #MeToo movement.
“Our work, our programs — and we’ve taken two years to really work hard to build out programs specifically so that we are hitting marginalized groups first, and so that we get to the people who usually don’t get the resources first,” Burke said.
Burke also encouraged students to get involved in procuring more resources at higher education institutions such as Harvard for people who faced sexual misconduct.
“When places like Harvard have courage they maybe haven’t had in the past, others follow,” Burke said. “You have the power now. You have the power in your pocketbook because you are paying tuition. Sit down and examine what forms of power you have, and use that power to push back.”
Maria Keselj ’23 said in an interview after the forum that it was “really insightful” to listen to the “empathy-based, survivor-based” perspective that Burke presented.
“We all have this urge to go and get justice,” she said. “But really, when you look back, is that what people really want? I find that it’s this really aggressive — and you can call it a toxic masculine — way to look at it.”
Correction: February 27, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that a jury charged Harvey Weinstein on two counts. In fact, the jury found him guilty of those two counts.

Daniel L. Everett, a linguist who also serves as the Dean of Arts and Sciences at Bentley University, introduced his newest book and discussed the origins of language to a crowd of more than 200 in the Science Center Wednesday evening.
The conversation on topics covered in Everett’s book, “How Language Began: The Story of Humanity’s Greatest Invention,” is part of a series of science-related book talks coordinated by the Harvard Division of Science, Cabot Science Library, and the Harvard Bookstore.
The premise of his new work is that language predates Homo sapiens, tracing back to Homo erectus.
Everett hypothesized that as long as the Homo genus has had the ability to create complex tools, communication has been necessary.
“[Tools] have symbolic and social components. They go beyond the functionally necessary, they go into style that represents one tradition over another,” he said.
He also said tools are evidence of culture, which in turn suggests the presence of language.
“You can’t have a language unless you have a culture, and you can’t have a culture unless you have a language,” Everett said.
Everett subscribes to the gradual theory of linguistics, the idea that spoken and written language developed over hundreds of thousands of years, rather than the saltationist one, which argues that the emergence of language occurred more suddenly.
“The evolution of the platforms for language and symbols took evolutionary time and are not limited to Homo sapiens,” he said. “You don't just get a creature that one day stands up and starts talking.”
Simge Topaloglu, a graduate student in psychology who attended the talk, said this differs from her viewpoint of how languages develop.
“It’s certainly a different approach to have language emerge — claiming that it emerged gradually over a million years or more as opposed to being attributed to a single mutation that possibly happened 50 to 60,000 years ago,” she said.
Even though the language of Homo erectus is less complex than the language of Homo sapiens, that does not necessarily make it less legitimate, Everett said.
He cited the lifestyle of Homo erectus to demonstrate that its language contained only what it needed to survive and to express itself, while pointing out that even some current languages do not have numbers and others do not have colors.
“How much grammar do you need to build a boat?” Everett said.
He added that the “simple” nature of the language of Homo erectus also is not necessarily indicative of its intelligence as a genus.
“You could say maybe [Homo erectus] had the intelligence of an eight-year old or 10-year old sapiens child,” he said. “No way to really know that, but let’s say they did — eight-year olds can talk a lot.”

A search is underway in Lowell House to fill eight positions left by tutors who plan to depart at the end of the semester, according to Faculty Dean David I. Laibson ’88.
A majority of the eight tutors — who comprise roughly 40 percent of the total in the House — are leaving because they will be completing their graduate degree programs.
In a Tuesday interview, Laibson described the “multi-stage” hiring process that the House is currently undertaking.
The house staff has already completed the initial application stage, during which they reviewed candidate applications. Next steps include interviews with House leadership and more informal meetings with students, allowing for them to interact “organically” with candidates, according to Laibson.
Laibson called the tutor position in Lowell House a “wonderful” role.
“I think people don't realize how great it is because it sounds kind of crazy when you're looking in from the outside,” he said. “It is truly a wonderful life, however strange it might first seem.”
Lowell House Committee Chair Ross D. Simmons ’21, who is participating in the informal meetings with prospective tutors, said he is looking for candidates who will be “present” and involved in student life.
“They should come to house events, they should eat dinner with students frequently, they should be present in the house, and be good advisors,” he said.
Other houses are also in the hunt for new tutors, and all plan to extend offers by March 26, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
Charlie S. Tyson, a departing tutor and Chair of Fellowships for Lowell House, said he believes the House will remain “warm” and “robust,” despite the departure of many seasoned tutors. He also said the turnover in tutors is comparable with the turnover among undergraduates, when each sophomore class replaces the House’s graduating seniors.
“It's always sad when you know one of your friends moves away, but the same could be said of the entire flock of seniors who graduate each year,” Tyson said. “Although the tutors do a lot to nourish the house community, look after students, and take an interest in them, what makes Lowell special is not the tutors, it’s the students.”
Hannah R. Shaffer, who will assume the position of Chair of Fellowships following Tyson’s departure, said she looks forward to welcoming the new class of tutors.
“I think new tutors often have a lot of spirit and drive, and they want to prove themselves,” Schaffer said. “I think mixing it up sometimes can be good. It kind of depends on how we all jive next year. I'm optimistic.”
Shaffer also said she believes some Lowell tutors may have stuck around for an extra year to assist with the recent faculty dean transition. In August 2019, Laibson and Co-Faculty Dean Nina Zipser replaced former Faculty Deans Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin, who had served in their positions for two decades.
Simmons said he believes the student-centric focus of the tutor hiring process lends itself to finding capable tutors to fill the vacancies.
“The House administration are trying to solicit as much student input as possible, which is important with hiring new tutors, because we're the ones they will interact with,” he said. “With so many tutors leaving — especially so many good tutors leaving — there will be many large shoes to fill. But I trust David and Nina to hire good people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Division I athletics programs across the nation unveil academic resource centers and one-on-one tutoring programs offered exclusively to enrolled athletes, Harvard Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said he does not support specialized academic programs geared toward student-athletes sprouting up in Cambridge.
Scalise said in a Tuesday interview that specialized academic resources to athletes run counter to Harvard Athletics’ mission.
“It's not a student development kind of direction,” he said. “I actually firmly believe that if we admit people to come here — and people come here for the right reasons and we are reasonable in our time commitments — that specialized academic resources for student-athletes that are not available to all of the students at the school is an unwise direction.”
Scalise said Harvard does not offer special academic attention to its athletes because it values their academic contributions to the College.
“Harvard and the Ivy League experience is a unique college experience in athletics, because you can compete at the highest level in most of our sports,” he said. “But you get a chance to have an academic experience that's second to none. And you have to decide what that's going to be. It’s different than other places.”
“The schools that do that tend to do that so that their kids stay eligible,” he said.
According to the Harvard Athletics website, Ivy League “athletes should be treated as other students, receiving nothing more nor less.”
And yet, other Ivy League schools provide academic support exclusively for athletes. The University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, Cornell University, and Brown University each boast student-athlete tutoring programs that provide individualized attention to athletes.
In doing so, Scalise said Harvard’s peer institutions are succumbing to national trends in collegiate sports.
“I'm starting to see these little — this creepage of the big time approach into other Ivy League schools,” he said. “And you have to say, at what cost are you willing to have this athletic success?”
Still, Student-Athlete Advisory Committee Co-President Madison J.H. Earle ’20 said she believes Harvard athletes would benefit from additional academic support.
Earle said she does not want athletes to gain access to resources not available to their non-athlete peers. Instead, she said she would prefer Harvard to tailor existing academic resources to align with athletes’ schedules.
Earle said the time athletes devote to their sport — which she estimated at roughly 30 hours per week — precludes them from taking full advantage of academic resources at Harvard that are ostensibly available to all undergraduates. She said professors’ office hours and sessions at the Academic Resource Center and the Harvard College Writing Center tend to coincide with athletes’ practices and competitions.
In the past, Harvard has offered resources aimed specifically at student-athletes in non-academic areas.
In the fall of 2018, Harvard Athletics and Harvard University Health Services’ Counseling and Mental Health Services co-created a program to support student-athlete wellness. Scalise noted in an email that the program does not dole out specialized resources to athletes, but instead extends the hours of previously existing resources to accommodate athletes.
Earle said that she hopes Harvard will foster an environment where athletes can succeed in both athletic and academic pursuits.
“You want to take pride in both and you don't want to excel in one and not in the other,” she said. “To excel in both you have to either make decisions [or] make sacrifices, and I think that with help it would make those decisions and sacrifices a lot easier.”
She added that she believes that the practice of offering additional academic resources to athletes is an equitable one.
“I don't think it is giving athletes any special treatment. I think it's just like leveling the playing field,” she said.
Asked about athlete concerns regarding academic support, Scalise cited both faculty fellows assigned to each team and College programs more broadly.
“The College offers a multitude of Academic Support to our student-athletes outside of practice and game hours via the Advising Programs Office, the Harvard College Writing Center, and the Academic Resource Center,” he said. “All student-athletes are encouraged to make use of those hours if they feel they need support.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid continued criticism over the lack of faculty and student diversity at the school, Harvard Kennedy School of Government Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said he hopes to engage with student activism in an interview Wednesday.
“Our students are passionate about making the world better. That's why we admit them to the Kennedy School — it’s because of that passion,” he said. “Universities tend to move more slowly than students want them to move, and I remember that very clearly from when I was a graduate student here at Harvard.”
Elmendorf stressed the role free speech plays in HKS’s programming, pointing to the John F. Kennedy, Jr. forum as a space for discussion between audience members and prominent speakers.
“Every event at the Kennedy School, with an outside speaker, there are questions and answers that come from the members of the audience and sometimes the questions are friendlier and sometimes the questions are more critical. That's part of the speech that we look for here,” he said. “We invite people when we think their ideas will be useful for our students to wrestle with.”
Kennedy School students and administrators have started their own discussions regarding diversity at the school in recent years.
Student groups such as the HKS Equity Coalition have advocated for the school to increase diversity in its student body, faculty, and curriculum. Earlier this month, the coalition sent an email — signed by multiple affinity groups and 375 HKS affiliates — to Elmendorf demanding that the school “commit to creating a culture and environment built on the principles of anti-racism.”
The letter called on HKS to implement mandatory diversity training for all HKS affiliates in the spring, host a required course across all degrees on the “history of race and inequality” for the upcoming fall semester, and hire faculty of color who “critically study the intersectionality of race, gender, class, and power.”
In his response, Elmendorf wrote that the Kennedy School will partner with advocacy group Community Change, Inc. to develop anti-racism workshops this spring that, if successful, will be piloted during new student orientation in the fall.
He also wrote that while he and his colleagues are “committed” to enhancing a diverse education at HKS, they are not yet convinced that “a required, standalone course is the best approach.”
Elmendorf added that the school hired five faculty members over the past three years such as Marcella M. Aslan ’99 and Desmond W. Ang “who work on aspects of ‘difference.’”
In the interview, Elmendorf, referencing the letter and his response, spoke about how the school has designed their search for new faculty to “reduce biases” and “cast a very wide net.”
“We have been able to hire outstanding people, because of that,” he added.
Elmendorf said that Sandra S. Smith, a current professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, will join the HKS faculty. Smith studies issues of urban poverty and racial inequality.
“She is one, now, of half a dozen faculty members we've hired in the last few years, who focus on race and gender identity issues,” Elmendorf said.
Elmendorf said the school also hopes to increase the amount of financial aid offered to its students.
“We're fortunate to have a lot of friends at the Kennedy School who provide financial aid who are not alumni of the school, but who believe passionately, like our students, in the importance of public service,” Elmendorf said. “And we hope to continue to increase the amount of financial aid we can offer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge will now accept and process bids for recreational cannabis businesses after a Superior Court judge ruled the city must do so, according to a Feb. 20 announcement.
The Cambridge solicitor’s office filed a motion last week appealing a Middlesex Superior Court decision which ruled Cambridge’s marijuana moratorium illegal. The moratorium — which gave “economic empowerment applicants” a two-year head-start in recreational marijuana sales — violated the the home rule amendment to the Massachusetts state constitution, the judge ruled.
Cambridge defined economic empowerment applicants as businesses run by people who have been disproportionately harmed by past marijuana laws.
During a city council meeting in June, Sumbul Siddiqui — who now serves as Cambridge’s mayor — spoke about the need for the two-year economic empowerment amendment.
“The country's racist war on drugs has heavily impacted and criminalized black and brown folks,” Siddiqui said.“It's our collective responsibility to do the best we can to fight [for] policies that provide equitable access to the wealth and opportunity inherent in this emerging billion dollar cannabis industry.”
Though a Feb. 14 statement said Cambridge would await further action by either the Superior Court or the Appeals Court before agreeing to new contracts with recreational pot companies, the city has revised its original position.
Cambridge will now accept all applications for “host community agreements” from interested parties. The city will also enter into HCAs with qualifying applicants, according to the revised announcement.
In order to obtain an HCA in Cambridge, businesses must submit a statement of interest to the city. Applicants may also be asked to present their information in person so city staff can ask them further questions.
According to city guidelines, a statement of interest consists of a cover letter, a special permit from the Cambridge planning board, a cannabis business permit, a management and operations profile, and qualifying documentation.
Moreover, applicants must submit a plan for “positive community impact” and certification, which mandates that a majority of the applicant’s employees will be minorities, women, or military veterans. Certification guidelines also encourage businesses to hire Cambridge residents.
Finally, if the application is approved, the business must hold semi-annual community outreach meetings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventy-nine percent of student beds in Adams House will be in singles and 77 percent will be in suite-style living after the House’s renovations are complete, architect Nathaniel F. R. Rogers ’05 said in a presentation to Adams affiliates Wednesday evening.
The renovations will also increase the capacity of Adams dining hall by 35 to 50 seats and add “new meeting and break out spaces,” according to the presentation, which was put on by Rogers and two other architects, Elizabeth Leber and Aaron M. Lamport ’90.
Adams House is currently in the first year of a four-year renovation plan — the longest project the College has taken on thus far as part of its House Renewal program.
At the presentation, students raised questions about murals that generations of Adams residents have painted on the walls of tunnels that run under the House.
Due to deterioration and groundwater damage, Rogers said they will not be able to save “many or any” of the original murals. However, he said they plan to create a digital photographic archive so students can “visit the tunnels virtually.”
“There will be an incredible amount of blank canvas to create new murals for the next 10, 20, 30, 40 years,” Rogers said. “This is really about another chapter in the Adams House story.”
The renovation also aims to unify the three buildings that comprise Adams House. Originally, separate developers built the buildings as private off-campus housing and never intended for them to “relate” to each other, per Rogers.
The project will create a “mid-block access” that extends from Russell Hall, to Claverly Hall, to Westmorley Hall. The mid-block access would make the outdoor sidewalk entrances to buildings the same level as the floor inside of them, allowing wheelchair users to enter more easily.
“This really serves two purposes,” Rogers said. “One is to really make Adams feel more like one single community, even though you're spread across three different city blocks. The second is it actually achieves a lot of accessibility needs.”
The renovation project will also make the Adams Pool Theater and the House’s courtyard more accessible.
Lamport also said that Adams House will be the first house to boast direct air ventilation into each individual room.
“It’s not air conditioning — it can’t claim to be that — but that air has been dehumidified, it’s going to be certainly cooler on a hot day than what’s out on the street, and it means there’s less of a need to open up a window,” he said.
Other amenities in the renovated house will include small offices designed for phone calls and a new common space called “The Loft.”
Adams is the sixth house — after Leverett, Quincy, Dunster, Winthrop, and Lowell — to be renovated.
Claverly Hall and Senior House — which are under construction during this academic year — will open in August 2020. Renovations on Randolph Hall and Apthorp House are set to begin this June and finish by January 2022, though students will not move into those buildings until the next academic year. Renovations on Russell Hall, Library Commons, and Westmorly Hall will start in June 2022 and end in August 2024.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final home weekend of the regular season, the Harvard men’s hockey team will be playing for multiple reasons.
The Crimson (12-9-6, 10-5-5 ECAC) entertains Rensselaer (15-15-2, 11-8-1) on Friday with a top-four finish and first-round bye in the conference tournament at stake. A victory for the hosts would clinch a second-round berth in the ECAC playoffs.
Saturday, Harvard’s 29-game slate concludes against Union (7-21-4, 5-13-2). Following the affair, the program will honor its five seniors as they soak up home ice one last time in the regular season.
“It’s obvious what’s in front of us,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “To go into the final weekend having to win at home to get home ice and a bye is a good position to be in…. If anything, the stakes really help determine the focus.”
Harvard is fresh off its North Country road trip to adversaries No. 7 Clarkson and St. Lawrence. Despite what the rankings suggest, the Crimson skated past the Golden Knights but bowed to the Saints, making for an altogether confusing trip to Upstate New York.
Coach Donato’s group pocketed its most inspiring win of the year, only to kill the momentum it brought with a disappointing performance the following night. This level of inconsistency has in some ways defined the season.
What’s more: Harvard enters the weekend without a national ranking next to its name for the first time in 2019-2020. The team, which sat as high as No. 9/6 in late November, slid off the top-20 big board on Monday.
So on top of ECAC and senior-night stakes, the upcoming battles with the Engineers and the Dutchmen represent opportunities for the Crimson to get back on track ahead of the postseason.
“We know if we play our game, we can beat anyone in the country,” Harvard captain Nathan Krusko said. “In many aspects, it’s kind of comforting to know that we have the artillery and the weapons to do what we want to do at the end and accomplish our goals. But we have to understand that it comes with a price, and we have to be willing to pay that.”
In the squads’ previous meetings, the Crimson nabbed two points against both RPI and Union. A 6-3 triumph over the Engineers before Thanksgiving marked the final win in Harvard’s six-game streak to open the schedule — that which propelled it into the top 10. The Crimson’s high-end players buried key goals in the latter half of the bout, pulling the team ahead.
As the spring term began in late January, a trip to Schenectady, N.Y. resulted in a high-scoring outing at the Dutchmen’s expense. A whopping six second-period strikes stood out in Harvard’s victory.
Both opponents will be seeking vengeance this weekend.
“My first two years, we had the bye and home ice,” junior forward Jack Badini said. “We know how important it is to get the extra week of rest and get mentally ready for the playoffs. So that’s definitely our main priority [on Friday].”
Despite the ups and downs this season, as Krusko noted the Crimson wields several weapons that give it a chance to win every night. Notably, coach Donato has assembled the most dangerous forward line in the conference and arguably in Division I.
RPI and Union are quite familiar with the wrath of sophomores Jack Drury (17–15—32) and Casey Dornbach (11–22—33) and freshman Nick Abruzzese (13–24—37). This trio combined for six points in November’s ousting of the Engineers and a remarkable 12 in last month’s thumping of the Dutchmen.
In per-game terms — relevant due to stricter limits on games played for Ivy League teams — this line occupies three of the NCAA’s top 12 spots in scoring. Abruzzese leads all first-years in outright assists, points, assists per game (0.89), and points per game (1.37).
Meanwhile, Dornbach has built on a stellar freshman campaign, in which he received ECAC Rookie of the Year honors, and is well above a point-per-game pace (1.22).
Drury (1.33 points per game), a precocious leader and reliable two-way center, has emerged as one of the league’s stars in 2019-2020. He is in an effective three-man race for ECAC Player of the Year with Abruzzese and Cornell’s Morgan Barron.
“It does definitely provide a sense of comfort that we have three tremendous players that, in all likelihood, are going to put up some points every night,” said Krusko, praising the Dornbach-Drury-Abruzzese line. “It inspires the other guys when they see them doing the right plays and when we can see them doing the hard plays as well. It pushes us, and it makes us want to be better and kind of match their level.”
In addition to Harvard’s potent triad, juniors Badini (6–8—14) and Henry Bowlby (6–7—13) provide top-end speed and can chip in offensively at critical times. Freshman John Farinacci (8–12—20) is another important piece up front and offers versatility as a natural centerman.
Additional scoring support comes from the back end in junior Reilly Walsh (5–16—21) and sophomore Jack Rathbone (6–20—26). Rookie Henry Thrun (3–16—19) not only moves the puck like his more senior defensive mates but also plays a commendably mature two-way game for a true 18-year-old.
Between the pipes, freshman Mitchell Gibson (9-7-3, 2.74 GAA, .915 SV%) earns most of the starts from the coaching staff. On Saturday, though — especially if the Crimson win the evening prior — it would make sense for fourth-year Cameron Gornet (3-2-3, 2.84 GAA, .909 SV%) to get the senior-night nod.
Compared to the young Harvard roster, the Engineers will ice a top-heavy lineup on Friday. Forward Chase Zieky (7–15—22) headlines a group of six seniors clustered at the top of the team’s scoring leaderboard. Defenseman Will Reilly (8–11—19) and wingers Mike Gornall (5–14—19) and Todd Burgess (13–6—19), who potted four pucks last Saturday, are among these impact veterans.
Arguably the most imposing player RPI will bring to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center is not a senior, but a sophomore: net-minder Owen Savory (11-9-2, 2.20 GAA, .926 SV%). In his last two weekends, Savory’s numbers (3-1-0, 1.26 GAA, .958 SV%) are even sturdier than his worthy season averages.
With two wins this past weekend, including a shutout against ranked Quinnipiac, RPI has put the pressure on the Crimson. The Engineers sit just two points behind Harvard in the conference standings and could threaten for a spot in the ECAC’s top four by season’s end.
“[RPI] is a different team right now [compared to when we played in November],” coach Donato said. “They’re playing really well. Good on special teams. They have some big wins under their belt…. We’ve been in a position to get home ice and a bye here for several years in a row. We can’t be any less hungry than they are.”
Through 32 games, RPI has posted goals per game (2.78) and goals against per game (2.69) metrics that rank just above NCAA averages. The group’s .500 record reflects the narrow spread between these numbers. The Engineers’ powerplay is pedestrian, sitting at 41st in the country (16.8%), but their penalty kill is top-15 (.849) and should be formidable resistance against the Crimson’s nation-leading man advantage (31.2%)
The powerplay is a large reason why Harvard finds twine more often than all but four Division-I teams (3.70). In terms of goals against per game, however, Harvard is more porous than roughly two thirds of college hockey (2.96).
Saturday, the attention will turn to Union. With just seven wins on the year, this squad concedes more goals (3.03) and scores substantially fewer (1.81) than Harvard. In January’s matchup between the teams, the Dutchmen put up a respectable five tallies but simply could not keep up with the skilled Crimson, which cashed in eight times in the track meet.
Union is led by players at either end of the age curve. Among the forwards, senior Anthony Rinaldi (7–16—23) and freshman Gabriel Seger (6–12—18) pace the group. On the blue line, fourth-year Vas Kolias (2–10—12) and rookie Dylan Anhorn (5–9—14) are most prominent. All four of these key contributors inked the scoresheet in January’s loss to the Crimson.
“Any team can play, and everyone has a lot of skill and a lot of talent and can push at times,” said Krusko, reflecting on the takeaways from his group’s the last meeting with Union. “One thing we learned was the power of momentum. When we come out hot and we put a few goals on the board, we can push the pace of play. If we decide to take our foot off the gas, they have weapons, too, and they’re going to push it.”
After a four-month slog through the campaign, Harvard has just two games separating it from a yearly goal: clinch a top-four seed in the conference. This will undoubtedly be the team’s primary focus this weekend, particularly on Friday when the only remaining contender for the first-round bye comes to Cambridge. The Crimson currently holds a mere two-point lead over RPI for the final bye-week slot.
Regardless of the weekend’s outcomes, Saturday night the home team will celebrate the class of 2020, comprised of Gornet, Krusko, and fellow forwards Frédéric Grégoire, Colton Kerfoot, and Justin Szeto. A top-four ECAC finish would make the celebration that much sweeter.
“I can’t say enough good things about the class [of 2020],” coach Donato lauded. “[They’re] guys that have been around for some great success — been part of a team that’s gone to a final four, that’s won the ECAC, that’s won the Beanpot, won the ECAC regular season. It’s really a great group of representatives for the hockey program and the university as a whole.”

Maybe you see the signs around dhalls about leaving food on your tray to be properly sorted or maybe you’ve seen the occasional composting bin around your House that made composting cross your mind. But with landfills contributing to climate change, what are some actionable ways to actually compost and reduce food waste on campus? Flyby has got you covered with some tips.
What to Compost
Confused about what you can and can’t compost? Harvard has a convenient poster highlighting some common items around campus that can and should be composted. Items include food scraps (like the HUDS meal you didn’t finish), used compostable containers and utensils (like the Ecocontainer dhall cups), and tea bags and coffee grounds. Keep in mind that you should remove the non-compostable components of what you hope to compost; take the staples out of tea bags and food stickers off of the fruit.
Where You Can Compost
So, where can you even compost around Harvard? If you’re in the Yard, odds are that you have a composting bin in your room, or at least can get one! Make sure to line the bin with a compostable “Biobag” from the trash room and use it. In upperclassmen Houses, there are composting bins in the dhalls, and it’s always possible to get in contact with your Sustainability Representative (REP) and Building Manager to find out how to live more sustainably in your House or Dorm. If you’re in the Science Center, there are compost bins near Clover.
Composting Tips
While it may be annoying to have to carry around an apple core until you come across a composting bin, it’s a small inconvenience for the goal of reducing overall waste. Think twice before you throw away items. Is what you’re about to trash compostable? If so, how can you make sure to compost it? If not, are there alternatives that you can choose in the future that would reduce waste? For instance, although your coffee cup may not be compostable, using a mug the next time you get coffee would be the best way to reduce unnecessary waste and cut out the need for composting. Skip the plastic bag the next time you go to FlyBy and avoid unnecessary packaging when possible. Educate yourself on composting protocol and make sure to follow through.
Other Ways Harvard Composts 
According to Harvard’s Sustainability website, Campus Services works with the Arnold Arboretum to compost a lot of waste that’s generated through landscaping. This waste is then used as soil amendments and mulch.
While composting may not be at the forefront of your mind, taking a few moments each day to be more mindful about what you throw away can have an impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Sibling indie pop band Echosmith, whose debut single “Cool Kids” shot them to stardom in 2013, performed at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston on Feb. 14, 2020. The multi-platinum group is back on tour promoting their sophomore album “Lonely Generation”, after a seven year break.


Jayden Bartels, a young up-and-coming artist who released her debut EP in the fall of 2019, was the first opening act of the show.




Los Angeles rock band Weathers took the stage as the second opening act and pumped the crowd up with their hit single “Happy Pills.”

 
Echosmith got the crowd’s hands up after taking the stage at around 9 pm. Throughout the night, they performed songs from their new album “Lonely Generation,” as well as past hits like “Over My Head” and “Bright." The band also performed a cover of Dua Lipa’s hit single “Don’t Start Now.”




Sydney Sierota, the lead singer of Echosmith, spoke about the themes of “coming of age, finding who you are, and also falling in love and discovering what all that means to you” that are captured in “Lonely Generation.” She said the album's vulnerability was a welcome challenge for the artists, who want to share their experiences from the seven years they were on hiatus.
“The things that are kind of hard to talk about are really important to talk about, too,” Sierota said.

 


Lead singer Sydney Sierota took the time to introduce her brothers, with Noah Sierota on bass and youngest brother Graham Sierota on the drums. The band has continued to produce music after their eldest brother, Jamie Sierota, left in 2016.

 
Sierota brought multiple people up on the stage during the concert, including her mother and the owners of the restaurant down the street where she had eaten dinner before the show, pictured here taking a selfie onstage.




The band closed out the show with a rousing performance of “Cool Kids,” which they said has as much, if not more, salience today than it did when it was released in 2013. “Social media has really hurt our generation,” Sierota said in an interview with The Crimson. “It's really pulled us away from being authentic and true to who we are — which is what "Cool Kids" is about, at the end of the day.”
