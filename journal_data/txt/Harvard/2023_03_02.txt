After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although The New Yorker criticized Sebastião Salgado’s photography during the Sahel famine of the 1970s claiming his “beautification … is a call to admiration, not to action,” very few of his images are beautiful. And unlike his later works, which became some of the most celebrated and widely known photography projects of all time, Salgado’s book “Sahel: The End of the Road” is neither mesmerizing nor captivating. In fact, the vast majority of its images, despite being compositionally elegant in Salgado’s trademark, highly saturated black and white style, make the viewer want to look away. Anybody who either appreciates art, feels compassion for the world, or both, should celebrate that distinction.
Before becoming the world-renowned photographer that he is today, Sebastião Salgado was a trained economist. During his time spent working for the International Coffee Organization in 1971 (a subject that he would later document at great length), he began taking photos. At first, he was merely a freelancer, but his desire to feel more connected to the people he knew only in academic contexts imbued him with the palpable empathy that defines his work today — a characteristic reflected by his emphasis on portraying the suffering of people who rarely have their stories told. Just over a decade later, working with the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, he began photographing a drought which tore through the lives of countless people across Africa’s Sahel region.
Sandwiched between Africa’s Sahara desert and savanna, the Sahel region has suffered a long history of droughts dating back to the 17th century. Between 1968 and the early 1980s, the period in which Salgado immersed himself, roughly 100,000 people died due to disease and food shortages. And although the subject matter is clearly worth documenting, the way Salgado chose to depict the famine's horrors attracted controversy.
Christopher Morton, writing in a 2006 volume of Anthropological Quarterly, said that “the photographs are beautiful, beguiling, visceral.”
“But as artistic formations, the photographs seem to be denied a living existence among the communities that they ultimately belong to,” he added. In his opinion, which was shared by many other critics, Salgado profited from the suffering of others without helping to alleviate their struggles.
Because of this perception and also due to the harshness of the images, no American publisher was willing to publish Salgado’s book, worrying that nobody would buy a book of such provocative images. Although the University of California’s Graduate School of Journalism eventually agreed to publish the book in 2004 in collaboration with the University of California Press, it is still Salgado’s least-known work.
But although some of Salgado’s Sahel photos are beautiful in terms of their perfect framing and notable grandeur, the vast majority aren’t. As a result, the simple, direct images serve a different purpose. His cover image is one of the only photos from the project that wowed me in the way that his later work consistently has. In this way, the cover image, which captures four robed refugees against a barren, dusty, and breathtakingly vast mountain range in Ethiopia, offers just enough incentive to open the book. From that point on, however, the body of images becomes significantly bleaker.
This reality is that — whether Salgado was still developing his style or acting intentionally — his deeply saturated black-and-white style is just about the only similarity between this project and his later works. Instead, in the Sahel, he frames his subjects with a matter-of-factness that he rarely continues in his later works. When he shot individual subjects in the Sahel, Salgado photographed them without emphasis on their environment. In images of groups, a similar people-first style highlighted the power of human relationships — those between mothers and their children, friends and their loved ones, and doctors and their patients — in dire times. And for somebody who later became known to the world as a master of grand, dramatic shots, his work in the Sahel is uncharacteristically narrow (of all his works, “Exodus” is likely the most similar in subject as it examines displacement in migrant communities, but does so with Salgado’s later-developed and considerably larger image scale and abstraction, often portraying hundreds of people together in massive environments).
One reason for this perception is that a large portion of the images in the Sahel are shot indoors. Primarily, due to Salgado’s work with Doctors Without Borders, they depict people of all ages receiving medical treatment or simply resting as they attempt to survive in incredibly difficult conditions.
Every one of these indoor images is dramatic for the unmissable frailty of Salgado’s subjects. If one image thus encompasses the entire project, it would be of a starved child, likely between the ages of five and ten, weighing himself in the Malian village of Gourma Rharous. The objective of the action: to enable the Doctors Without Borders clinic to appropriately ration food.
Still, this is far from the most disturbing of Salgado’s images. Throughout the project, he depicts countless people dying as they cling to their last moments of life.
In this way, criticisms of Salgado’s dilution of human suffering are unfounded because none of these images are easy to look at. Whether Salgado was opportunistic in utilizing the plight of others for his own benefit is a deeper, more real concern, but nonetheless one that the artist’s intent exonerates him from. This is because beneath every seemingly one-dimensional depiction of suffering is a story of resilience told by a man deeply inspired by the beauty of the universal human condition.
In the words of Michael Brenson writing for The New York Times in 1991, “Mr. Salgado finds in this raw, stripped-down state an existence that is highly physical but never soulless.”
By photographing people in their darkest times, when they are clinging to hope, connections, and resolve, Salgado illuminates the essence of life for people throughout the entire world.
But even if one deems intent irrelevant, Salgado’s Sahel images serve to illuminate the extent of human suffering that exists largely unknown to millions of people in more fortunate parts of the world, which Salgado notes is in a “crisis of excess.” And although many global observers may be aware of the gravity of certain crises in terms of their statistical significance — figures frequently quantify the number of people killed, injured, or displaced — Salgado attempts to individualize a tragedy that affects millions. By conveying the harshness of an issue that is both specific and overlooked, Salgado’s collection contributed to a global repository of sympathy and sensitivity, which can only impact future efforts from organizations like Doctors Without Borders in positive ways. In a more tangible sense, the proceeds of Salgado’s book sales, which were donated to the same foundation, aim to help alleviate future suffering of the kind he captured.
The acuteness of the empathy he seeks to impart on his viewers, then, makes the work all the more important at a time when the frequency of climate-induced catastrophes, like that which he documented, is only set to increase. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Sahel will continue to heat up in coming years, catalyzing intensified periods of extreme weather such as droughts and floods as a result of climate change.
In this light, and as increasing numbers of similar events ravage global populations, photography like Salgado’s is critical to transport the realities of the human experience beyond borders and across continents. For a battle that can only be won with collective action, such art, despite some concerns, is not only pivotal but irreplaceable.
—Alexander J. Gerstenhaber’s column “F4: The World in Pictures” is an appreciation of the photography that tells untold stories about the joys, hardships, and realities of the world’s people.

Over the past decade, music listeners everywhere bore witness to the ever-growing “sad girl” music genre that originated in the indie scene before rapidly taking over the mainstream music industry. The sound of this soft grunge niche is characterized by melancholic, lo-fi synth production and acoustic instrumentation. Lyrics on these tracks often discuss coming of age themes, trauma, and heartbreak. While a hallmark of the genre is its raw lyrical relatability, often consisting of simple poetic devices reinforced by soft, emotional vocals. With her debut album “Good Riddance,” Gracie Abrams contributes to this tradition; however, she fails to instill a lasting impact on the indie pop legacy.
Gracie Abrams rose to prominence in 2020 with her EP “minor,” which would go on to inspire Olivia Rodrigo’s infamous chart topping single “driver’s license.” She released her sophomore EP “This is What it Feels Like” in 2021, solidifying her position in the bedroom pop genre. Both pieces showcased Abrams’s talents as a song-writer and brought her great acclaim for her “string of consciousness” style of storytelling and sharp lyrical caliber.
At the moment, the 23-year-old boasts over 7.8 million monthly listeners on Spotify and is gearing up for not only her own tour, but her position as an opening act for Taylor Swift’s “The Eras” tour. Swift affirmed her support for Abrams in a “Rolling Stone” article in anticipation of the “Good Riddance” release, stating, “Gracie’s writing mixes fragility with introspection in a way that I really relate to.”
Such praise from the Queen of Pop herself — in addition to the immense public support which Abrams garners from millions of teenage girls around the world — would seemingly set the stage for a spellbinding freshman album from the singer-songwriter. “Good Riddance” however, is just OK.
Most of the 12 tracks on Abrams’s first album are predictable and generic. The listener is almost sure to be greeted by a synth beat or an acoustic guitar, followed by stereotypical lyrics rooted in tropes of young adulthood, and finally, a lo-fi culmination of adolescent angst supported by a folk-esque band. Then, just rinse and repeat. Few songs stand out against the grain of this unoriginal mold.
This doesn’t make the music itself “bad,” per se. There is a reason why this mold works: Listeners enjoy it and it sells records, as evidenced by the hundreds of indie pop albums to come before it. However, Abrams does little to nothing to expand on or experiment with this formula.
Lyrics littered throughout the album — such as “I guess I’m just difficult,” “If I move out this year, I’ll feel my parents slippin’,” and “I’ve been speakin’ / To my therapist, I call her every weekend” on track “Difficult” — read like blatant pandering to Gen Z and their obsession with celebrity relatability. A lyric on the same track, “Was it somethin’ that I said that colored you blue?'' might as well be a direct allusion to Halsey’s infamous “Colors” (2015) and the pseudo-deep lyrics for which it’s remembered.
In spite of the fact that tracks like “This is what the drugs are for” and “Full machine” represent a developing thematic maturity in Abrams’ new music, it is often overshadowed by the pseudo-relatability to which the lyricism subscribes. Moments like these highlight how little Abrams has grown as an artist since her initial releases.
Track 7, “Amelie,” stands out as an exception, which can be largely attributed to the narrative potency of the lyrics and the intrigue of the song’s namesake. As opposed to a collage of archetypal, contrived proclamations of heartbreak, “Amelie” distinctively acts as a borderline character study. The compelling nature of the song is enhanced by the momentum of its chorus as the audience is swept by the swell of the music: “Where did you go / Amelie, Amelie, Amelie? / Where’d you go?”
“Good Riddance” certainly leaves something to be desired. Although this record debut serves as a great ambiance-setting soft grunge piece, it isn’t something many people would reach for on its own due to its lack of individuality. It feels as though “Good Riddance” attempts, and fails, to capture the same feelings as legendary albums of the genre such as “Melodrama” by Lorde (2017) and “Punisher” by Phoebe Bridgers (2020). Even though “Good Riddance” will undoubtedly accrue acclaim from “sad girl indie” music enthusiasts everywhere, it really isn’t a revolutionary album. But not every album can be.

“Border Patrol Target Range, Near Gulf of Mexico, Texas” by Richard Misrach
Last semester, my Hum 10 seminar had the opportunity to discuss literature and art in the Harvard Art Museums. The week that we read “Lost Children Archive” by Valeria Luiselli, I came across Richard Misrach’s life-size photograph “Border Patrol Target Range,” in his collection “Crossing Lines, Constructing Home: Displacement & Belonging in Contemporary Art.” I was immediately captivated by both the large-scale presentation of the photograph and the poignant personal and cultural weight that it carried. Just as “Lost Children Archive” immerses readers in the experience of displacement — both through the physical road trip and implicitly familial context — the print forces us to interrogate our own roles in the border crisis and our relationships to otherhood and violence. Luiselli’s novel emphasizes documentarianism, or the art of being intentional in capturing and remembering. Likewise, Misrach’s photograph asks us: whose lens are we looking through? What perspectives are we adopting? It challenges us to engage with unjust policies at local and national levels that we have a duty — and are in a position of privilege — to change.

The Stairs at 485 Broadway 
I hurry out of the street and down a side staircase to 485 Broadway’s lower lecture hall. The Cambridge winter gray behind me, I savor the anticipation of the vibrant art awaiting me in an imminent art history lecture. Yet in the liminal space between lobby and lecture, I find myself submerged in an entirely unexpected burst of art: the stairwell. I can’t help but pause to feel the color pulsating from the walls’ painted shapes, an utter mockery of my expectations of a staircase. The disruptive geometry of vermilion, cerulean, and marigold forms flirt around the rationalized order of wall, corner, and panel, suffused with a kind of chromatic luminance that renders even a blue sky’s daylight disappointing. The stairwell’s playful defiance of the anticipated slyly transforms the passing-through-ers into active viewers. Just like that, I realize, my outlook has been transformed before I’ve even set foot into an art history lecture.

“Lake O’Hara” by John Singer Sargent 
The best paintings take you by surprise. As I turned the corner into the European and American Art room on the second floor of the Fogg Museum, John Singer Sargent’s “Lake O’Hara” stunned me. Nearly 39 by 46 inches, the scene contains majesty, movement, and reticence. The oil painting depicts a glacial lake surrounded by mountains of the Canadian Rockies. The lake is vibrant turquoise green, and driftwood floats calmly in the shallows. The mountains dominate the entire background, their snowy slopes reaching upward to the top of the canvas, denying even a glimpse of the sky. Rather, the reddish rock face turns cool and blue as it grows farther from the viewer. What initially appear as splashes and specks become details of majestic realism with Sargent’s skilled hand — scruffy dabbles of brown and green are a shaded evergreen forest, and palette-scaped patches of gray are the rocky cliffside. “Lake O’Hara” is a painting that portrays the peculiar, awe-inspiring quiet of nature — a solitude in which there is only oneself among nature’s grandeur. Sargent was not traditionally a landscape painter, and he spent most of his career painting portraits. On a trip out West, however, he began “painting en plein air,” or the process of painting outdoors with unfixed conditions. His richly serene painting of Lake O’Hara evokes the abstract realism of both that form of painting as well as the fleeting beauty of nature itself. Both the painting and nature are always moving, always shifting even in their stillness. With each glance, there is something new to discover.

“Death and Victory” by John Singer Sargent 
Every time I wander up the marble steps of Widener Library, I am greeted by my dearest friend at Harvard: “Death and Victory,” the 1922 mural by John Singer Sargent. This piece, along with its companion mural “The Coming of the Americans,” towers fourteen feet above the constant stream of Widener pilgrims that floods the main staircase. In “Death and Victory,” a soldier grapples with the dual allegorical figures of Death — a veiled, feminine shadow — and Victory — a shining, winged vision.
One cannot live in Boston without seeing John Singer Sargent’s touch. Yet I feel the closest to Sargent’s legacy while viewing “Death and Victory.” When Sargent was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of the Arts at Harvard, his citation read, “When we and all the things we see about us here are seen no more, the canvas his brush has touched, men will still gaze upon with wonder.” I am one of those staring up with wonder. Sargent’s mural connects me to Harvard’s storied past through the mythos of this iconic artwork, and for a moment I’m transported away from my studies and up into the arms of glorious Victory.

Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts
The first thing my parents noticed on move-in day was the “ugly building” on the street across from Hurlbut Hall. The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts was jarringly gray and angular. Its large glass windows emanated with light in the pink Cambridge sunsets, its rough pillars and jutting terraces watchful over the quiet evenings. I used its unmissable concrete edges as a landmark to find my way back to Hurlbut Hall in my first month or so on campus. Then, I took an Art History printmaking class on its fourth floor that stained my fingernails with ink for a week. My classmate told me on one of those early Saturday mornings that the Carpenter Center was the only building in North America designed by pioneering Modernist architect Le Corbusier. I didn’t know who he was but this revelation sent me down a Wikipedia rabbit hole — I clicked through pages Brutalism, Purism, and his many contributions and controversies. I realized it was one of those Harvard moments: passing by something casually monumental and barely recognizing it. When I’m looking out from the inside, its fractured design breaks the surrounding area into a kaleidoscope of windows. Outside, the sweeping curves and layers of concrete give the structure a dynamic quality. Some nights its arches still surprise me as I cut across to Prescott Street; the concrete hangs over me with a certain understated grace.

“Gare-Saint Lazare: Arrival of a Train” by Claude Monet
In the Wertheim Room at Harvard Art Museums, I am surrounded by beautiful, famous artworks. But I am always immediately drawn to “The Gare Saint-Lazare: Arrival of a Train” by Claude Monet — one of twelve paintings depicting the smoke and bustle of a Parisian train station. The thick, dappled brushstrokes trace whorls of billowing smoke that obscure the steel and glass frame of the station, the background a haze of faint pastel buildings and gray-blue sky. The train itself has a mythic, almost lifelike quality through its imposing presence — it dwarfs the smudges of coal and workers beside it, sunlight glinting off the gleaming black engine.
Monet was fascinated with the idea of painting an image that was fleeting in its beauty and with transforming the ephemeral into the enduring through art. He often chose to paint a theme on a series of variations in order to capture its essence, but I find this painting particularly compelling because of the industrial subject. One critic wrote that Monet’s painting depicted a “monster with a bronze shell and tongue of fire” — this potent, animalistic imagery evokes a sense of awe in the power of industrial architecture. I love this painting as an ode to the power of the locomotive and as a triumphant attempt to transcend a moment by preserving it for eternity in art.

Looking for a pleasant night out at the theater? Go no further than Farkas Hall. The Hasty Pudding is putting on its annual comedy show, a welcome trip to a chaotic era guaranteed to keep the audience laughing and hooked by plot twists until its final curtain. An original musical, “Cosmic Relief!” was written by Maureen Clare ’24 and Matthew Cole ’24 and composed by Veronica Leahy ’23 with lyrics by Mireya Sanchez-Maes ’24.
“Cosmic Relief!” takes its audience to another planet — well, eventually — but initially only gets as far as Hollywood in the 1960s. Lauren Order (Emma Rogers ’25), an FBI agent, is tasked with outing the communist C-list director Worse N. Welles (Taylor Kruse ’23). Instead, she uses this as an opportunity to fake the moon landing and get back into the good graces of J. Edgar Hoover. In the process, Lauren actually becomes connected with the film and its cast and crew, leading her to question her steadfast commitment to anti-communism, which she uncritically embraced all the way back in childhood, when she turned in her communist mother.
Setting the scene amid 1960s communist paranoia, the writing plays off an uncontroversially controversial time; throw-away jokes referring to Nixon or communism always land, even if they occasionally seem obvious or repetitive. There is also clever wordplay involving characters’ names and in-jokes referring to Harvard (think, you can “always go to McKinsey afterwards” when your career flops) or Hasty Pudding itself.
The show becomes even more meta by bringing the technical crew on stage and having the band rouse some audience participation, all fostering a playful, collaborative environment.
The Hollywood setting, red-scare dramatics, and the science fiction movie all create entertaining disorder, especially as they center around Lauren as the incompetent officer. However, between wanting a moon landing, wanting to fake a moon landing and wanting to arrest the people involved in the production, the plot does get lost at times. But the way the actors interact with each other — whether squabbling or acting united against the FBI — consistently conveys their chemistry and allows the plot to hold the audience’s attention.
The cast’s ability to be charming is especially impressive considering most of the characters are individually quite annoying due to their social and personal incompetence. Lauren is an obnoxious try-hard, but Rogers nails the comic awkwardness of her amateur actions while Bernardo de Moura Sequeira ’26 as Justin D’Backcrowned is hilariously self-deprecating.
As can be expected from Hasty Pudding, much of the cast takes on genderbending roles, which often turn into the highlights of the show. Matthew W. Cole ’24 as Aunty Establishment is delightfully over the top. Just when you start to want more of her seemingly C-level storyline, you discover the plot twist that makes her essential to the show.
Sophie M. Garrigus ’25 as Theodore Mee is also enjoyably silly in her portrayal of the lazy over-appreciated actor. Her performance is unwavering, though the British accent is a bit unclear at times.
Perhaps the only confusing gender swap is Jacob K. Ostfeld ’23 as the dog that goes into space, Lassie Ninorbette, who appears to be male-presenting until they call her a “bitch” in a joke that garners more gender confusion than laughs.
Many of the actors also stand out for their unfaltering accents, such as Worse’s classic retro Hollywood director voice. Additionally, Lyndsey R. Mugford ’23 plays Esther Terrestrial, a method actor too committed to her role as an alien queen, and maintains a loud, harsh, animatronic voice that embodies her forceful, inhuman character.
The music further proves that the talent is not limited to acting. The band doesn’t miss a beat and the cast all have voices strong enough to support their solo numbers. The songs are mostly lighthearted and funny, and they sustain the humorous banter of the show’s dialogue.
The end of the show deviates from its initial style when it starts focusing on choreography in a journey through space. While most of the show’s choreography seems simple though well-executed, the final parts allow director-choreographer Larry Sousa (one of the non-student contributors to the musical) to create a significantly more intricate dance number. This artistic depiction does away with the plot and dialogue and is a more imaginative form of storytelling that is compelling in its novelty. Isabel V. S. Wilson, who plays Dr. Noah Credited, excels in her performance at the beginning of the sequence, and the rest of the team — both the cast and, notably, the band — deliver emotional peaks of discovery and comedy, that range in speed, style, and of course include their signature kickline.
The set design of the show is variable, much of the show consisting mostly of backdrops, and then becoming more heavy-duty later on. The backdrops are likely less labor intensive than constructed pieces, but well-designed and effective at illustrating the Hollywood studio environment. The latter part of the show does include more moving structures, expanding to show Welles’s movie’s set and creatively transitioning into space using projections and hanging props to represent planets.
The costuming and makeup are also very well-done, spanning from hippie styles and alien fashion to spacesuits. Aunty wouldn’t have the same presence without the tie-dye, fake saggy boobs, and sloppy lipstick, nor would Esther without her metallic gown and purple skin.
The show is chaotic in the most fun way, with confusing plots, interpretive dances, inept characters, and meta humor, checking off all the boxes theater lovers look for.
“Cosmic Relief!” runs through March 5 at Farkas Hall, before shipping off to New York City and Hamilton, Bermuda. You can purchase tickets here.

A woman sits in front of a phone camera propped up against her vanity. She leans in close to the lens, contorting her face to expertly apply foundation and contour, squinting a little to pencil her waterline, and smacking her lipstick just right. She applies each step with deft ease and practiced precision, perfectly enhancing her features in that effortless covergirl style. But she’s not even paying attention to the strokes of her various brushes; she’s explaining, in heartbreaking detail, her recent traumatic miscarriage and her fear of getting pregnant again. She is participating in a common social media fad, one wherein creators share their deepest thoughts while performing their daily routine, cheerfully dubbed “Get Ready With Me,” or GRWM for short.
Perhaps the GRWM phenomenon is a consequence of Vogue’s latest Youtube series, wherein young, dewy celebrities walk through their dozen-step, hundreds-of-dollars skincare and makeup routines for an audience of 12.7 million subscribers. The series’s participants maintain a careful balance, letting their aura of fame down just enough to seem human and accessible while remaining polished enough to maintain a vast, eager, consumerist fanbase.
Whether this is the symptom or source of a broader trend, influencers, micro-influencers, and everyday people creating these GRWM videos — the vast majority of whom are women — have taken it up with zeal. Women poised in front of the camera, make-up brush in hand, have become ubiquitous across TikTok, Instagram reels, and social media more broadly.
In our current digital age, more women than ever have platforms to share their voices. Social media, for all its flaws and social expectations weighing most on young women, has provided them the biggest platform to express themselves and speak their opinions. Maybe, then, this trend is empowering. Certainly the woman speaking out about her miscarriage to a platform of thousands of viewers helps to reduce the stigmas surrounding pregnancy loss and reproductive-related depression and anxiety.
Additionally, these videos de-mystify beauty by showing just how much work goes into crafting that perfectly “effortless” look. These women use this lengthy, daily task to speak about issues important to them, demonstrating that she does not have to look perfectly polished in order to say something meaningful, and empowering her to reclaim that time in her day. Time that society and convention dictate should be spent on appearance upkeep is reclaimed for intellectual and social activity.
Though not typically interactive, these types of videos certainly have a social component. In watching someone “put their face on” for the day, there is an element of conspiracy and intimacy common in women-dominated spaces, particularly in the liminal and undervalued space of the public bathroom.
Historically, bathrooms frequented by women-identifying people serve a purpose beyond just a stop to “do your business.” They are a space outside of reality, where you can duck in with a friend or two, debrief, share some gossip, touch up makeup, make a new friend, give yourself a pep talk, and re-enter the real world. The cliché that women always go to the bathroom in groups is not totally unfounded; sometimes the bathroom is a social event, a sort of sacred space to say what you really think and let your guard down. To some extent, the GRWM trend is a window into this social structure. Through the process of applying various creams, gels, and powders, content creators induce that same sort of liminal freedom, granting themselves (and us as the consumers) permission to say what they really think, as if we were all crowded around a mirror in a sticky club bathroom.
Maybe it’s all just a good time — as gossipping in a bathroom often is — with no deeper purpose. But when watching a woman talk about one of the most private, heartbreaking, and physically painful experiences a person can go through, holding in tears as she applies mascara, it’s hard to see this as just frivolous fun.
Something about this trend feels more sinister, like society won’t deign to listen to women unless they are literally obscuring their faces with tools and cosmetics, as if we need this distortion as a sort of disclaimer to her comments. Her discussion of serious topics while simultaneously enhancing her features shows that like her face, these issues should be smoothed, softened, and made more presentable before releasing them into the mainstream. Her conspiratorial attitude works against her, cheapening her message and relating her words only to the intimate community she has induced rather than the public at large.
While her words might be powerful, speaking on topics from love to politics to trauma and depression, every one of these videos comes to the same conclusion: She lays down the brush and poses for the camera. There. Done. Ready. The ending befuddles the beginning: The end of her intellectual point and the beginning of her day. Everything she’s been talking about is therefore a conspiratorial sidebar, irrelevant to the ultimate goal: Getting ready for something that the viewer will never see. It may appear as if she is unmasking herself, revealing the minutiae of her morning routine, but by the end she is polished, or “face on,” as the saying goes.
She walks an impossible tightrope, attempting to say something meaningful while still keeping it casual, wanting to be relatable yet also speak to her own experiences, taking up space but never too much. It should be enough for her to just face the camera and speak her mind however she wants. Why must she exist in a perpetual state of transit and preparation? And when, finally, will we ever just be ready?

Why are people posting on social media about selling their parents’ houses and kidneys? For Beyoncé, of course.
On Feb. 1, Beyoncé announced that she will be going on a world tour after the release of her latest album, “Renaissance.” Following the announcement that her tour would span locations across Europe and North America — apparently the only two places in the world — some fans were thrilled, while others started thinking about which organs they could live without.
Here’s how it went down: Ten minutes before presale, fans began entering the queue, waiting for their chance to secure tickets. The wait was the easy part: Once in, the process of buying a ticket became a “f-cking bloodbath,” according to one TikTok user, as available tickets kept getting snatched away. Posting how-tos on getting Beyoncé tickets has even become a trend.
Trying to get early tickets was particularly stressful due to claims on social media leading up to sales that tickets would cost up to tens of thousands of dollars. One Instagram user made a faux tutorial on how to get Beyoncé tickets, joking that it would be necessary to “set up your own kidnapping and ransom.” In one viral TikTok, one user showed that she would be sacrificing the money that usually went to therapy to see Beyoncé. In another TikTok, the user filmed themselves on a plane, saying that they were flying to Europe because they couldn’t afford the tickets in the U.S.
But are tickets actually expensive enough to warrant an international flight or kidnapping? Many members of the BeyHive, Beyoncé’s worshipping fanbase, would say no. Depending on location and timing, tickets range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. In light of this, many fans appreciated the fact that tickets cannot be resold for more than their original cost, though it is unclear whether Beyoncé had a role in this decision.
The discourse surrounding the scramble for tickets seems to get at a deeper question: Do celebrities care about their fans as much as their fans care about them, or are they just in it for the money? Fans devote limitless time and money to support celebrities, attend concerts, buy merchandise, and follow their every move on social media. Because of their devotion, some fans feel as though they know celebrities personally, which is why they are so quick to defend Beyoncé.
However, many also sense that celebrities may not have the same level of investment in their fans and instead are primarily motivated by money and fame. Unreasonably expensive tickets can make it seem as though celebrities like Beyoncé are exploiting their fans’ devotion, causing some to wonder why fans would give money to somebody who is already a multimillionaire. But whether you feel that the prices are fair or not, some people are always going to buy Beyoncé tickets no matter what.
Such is the Beyhive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is unwise to bestow upon any one performer the title of “best.” Live music, like any art, is subjective. It’s also a matter of expectations: Metallica puts on a great show, but not if one enters the venue expecting Klezmer music.
But as one exits the pit after a Billy Strings concert, to call him and his band the best live act in the business feels natural. It probably isn’t true. But it might be.
In the most basic sense, Billy Strings plays bluegrass. His band, which consists of mandolinist Jarrod Walker, banjo player Billy Failing, bassist Royal Masat, and fiddle virtuoso Alex Hargreaves, features traditional bluegrass instrumentation. His setlists contain numerous bluegrass standards: Strings’s Feb. 17 show at Atlantic City’s Hard Rock Live featured covers of J.D. Crow’s “Portrait of the Blues,” John Hartford’s “Today,” Flatt and Scruggs’ “If I Lose,” and two songs originally by genre patriarch Bill Monroe “‘Ashland Breakdown” and “Close By.”
And the Grateful Dead shirt-adorned crowd laps it up. It’s an incredible sight — you haven’t lived until you’ve seen 5,000 people jump up and down in unison to an acoustic rendition of the Appalachian staple “Shady Grove” which is believed to have evolved from a song written in 1613.
Strings is a world-class guitar flat picker with an all-star cast of sidemen. It’s no surprise that he plays traditional bluegrass and folk songs at a high level. There are hundreds of artists who can do just that. But it is with his stage presence and production, his use of guitar and vocal effects, and his original music that Strings separates himself from other talented bluegrass acts.
Strings grew up playing both bluegrass and heavy metal, a fact that is evidenced by his demeanor on stage. Far from the buttoned-up nature of old-time bluegrass acts like the aforementioned Monroe, Strings is every bit the rockstar, complete with hair flips, headbanging, sprints across stage, and a steady diet of guitar god poses and facial expressions. His setup also features an impressive light show and a huge screen — both necessities in a venue as large as Hard Rock Live.
Never once did Strings and his band appear too small for the massive arena. That same sentiment extended to the band’s sound: Despite the amplified acoustic nature of their instruments, the five musicians filled the space with ease. When Strings uses pedal effects to make his acoustic guitar sound electric, as he did during a more than four-minute-long guitar solo on his original song “Away From The Mire,” the group is as loud as any rock band.
The only deviation from the show’s raucous volume came during a brief interlude halfway through the second set, when Strings — now playing banjo — joined Failing for a rendition of Strings’s original, “Dos Banjos,” before being rejoined on stage by the rest of the band for a trio of single-microphone performances, including another Strings original, “Freedom” — one of the night’s highlights.
Strings’s original songs range from rock-solid traditional bluegrass (‘Hollow Heart,’ ‘Dust In A Baggie,’ ‘Know It All’) to funky, bass-driven improv-fests (‘Doin’ Things Right’) to spacy, drawn-out jams (“Away From The Mire”). For a band without much instrumental diversity, it’s a remarkably engaging set. Mix in a few bluegrass standards, and there’s something for every fan.
That, of course, is the magic of Billy Strings. Yes, his playing is technically impressive. Yes, his voice is unique and accurate. But it is the diversity of his sets and the adrenaline with which he plays them that has enabled him to take bluegrass to heights it has never seen before — like, for example, Hard Rock Live, a 5,000-seat venue in Atlantic City, which is not exactly known for its bluegrass scene.
There are few artists who can command the attention of that many people for three hours. There are fewer still who can do it without backup dancers or pyrotechnics. There is only one artist who can do it playing bluegrass. And that man is the one and only, Billy Strings.

What do you think of when you think of American folk music? Perhaps Pete Seeger ballads come to mind. Maybe you are reminded of American classics such as “Yankee Doodle” or the music of Bob Dylan. The variety of these examples alone showcases the diversity of this difficult-to-define category. Yet, when viewed holistically, the one unifying characteristic of American folk is its “for the people” nature. Whether you’re listening to Odetta or the Indigo Girls, Tracy Chapman or Joni Mitchell, you’ll find that at the core of the guitar chords is a story of everyday experiences amidst a backdrop of major political and social events. Thus, the trajectory of American folk music follows the trajectory of American history.
The ’60s and ’70s were arguably the peak of American folk music; with the Vietnam War and women’s rights, civil rights, and gay rights movements, the folk scene was bursting with passion. Below are some of our favorites that are sure to get you hooked on American Folk!
Early ’60s:
“Blowin’ In the Wind” by Odetta (1963)
A staple of both folk and blues, Odetta is a must-listen. Given the historic events of the civil rights movement at this time, her strong, trailblazing voice and skillful guitar playing adds new meaning to this powerful song of protest, which was originally released by Bob Dylan.
“The Times They Are A-Changin’” by Bob Dylan (1964)
An anthem for many social movements, “The Times They Are A-Changin’” brilliantly and beautifully encapsulates the feelings associated with the moment in history at which it was released. Frequently covered by old and new artists alike, the sentiment Dylan expresses continues to speak to listeners across generations.
“California Dreamin’” by ​​The Mamas & the Papas (1965)
California Dreamin' is the epitome of Laurel Canyon, a musical landmark where breakthrough sounds were created within the mountainous hills of Hollywood — where numerous greats of American folk lived. This song will transport listeners right to the canyon while clapping and singing along with The Mamas & the Papas.
“Turn! Turn! Turn!” by The Byrds (1965)
With lyrics pulled directly from the Bible, this upbeat and encouraging song takes age-old lessons and merges them with the culture and events of 1965. The recognizable strums of the Rickenbacker guitar and beat of the tambourine, coupled with the group’s impeccable harmonizations, makes this song a staple of American Folk.
Late ’60s
“For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield (1966)
The forthright lyrics and chilling electric guitar chords of “For What It’s Worth” are at the very core of Vietnam War-inspired folk rock. Lines such as “paranoia strikes deep” and “battle lines being drawn” are the musical embodiment of the antiwar sentiment of the ’60s.
“Suzanne” by Leonard Cohen (1967)
The gentle, hypnotic tune of Suzanne tells the story of Leonard Cohen’s alleged affair with Suzanne Verdall. Though written and popularized by Cohen, Suzanne was debuted by Judy Collins in 1966 and was infamously performed by the pair in 1976, embodying the hallmark sharing of ideas within American folk.
“America” by Simon & Garfunkel (1968)
Simon & Garfunkel are a staple of American folk, and their song “America” arguably defines the genre; themes of strife, hope, and everyday occurrence are alive in this travel story. The song continues to be reinvented and was covered by the contemporary folk duo First Aid Kit.
“Both Sides Now” by Joni Mitchell (1969)
A Laurel Canyon giant, Joni Mitchell’s hit song “Both Sides Now” has continued to resonate with fans for decades, given its eternally applicable theme of looking back retrospectively and feeling content with the unknowns of life. Mitchell’s mezzo-soprano voice gives this song a tone of childlike innocence, matching the innocuous lyrics.
Early ’70s
“Our House (Demo)” by Graham Nash and Joni Mitchell (1970)
Though only recently released on the 50th anniversary edition of “Deja-Vu,” the 1970 demo of Nash’s “Our House” is arguably more relevant to understanding American folk, given its vocals by Joni Mitchell. Written about the house Mitchell and Nash shared in Laurel Canyon, this song demonstrates the close-knit American folk community of the ’70s.
“Plane Wreck at Los Gatos/Deportee” by Joan Baez (1971)
A lesser-known yet powerful Joan Baez cover of Woody Guthrie, this song introduces the theme of immigration to the genre of American Folk, illuminating the harrowing reality at the Mexican border. The daughter of a Mexican immigrant, Baez’s purposeful use of Spanish lyrics and flamenco-inspired chords evoke sympathy.
“The Wind” by Cat Stevens (1971)
The high-pitched guitar chords coupled with the low, sweet voice of Cat Stevens gives The Wind a light, airy feel, exemplifying the underlying theme of peace within American folk music. This is the first song on Cat Stevens’ Teaser and the Firecat, which includes his famous hit, “Peace Train.”
“Here Comes the Sun” by Richie Havens (1971)
Havens reimagines the Beatles’ hit song in his unique folk rendition of “Here Comes the Sun” through fast-paced guitar strumming, use of the conga drum, whistling, and humming. Known for awe-inspiring performance at Woodstock, Havens’ soulful voice gives new meaning to these well-known lyrics.
Legacy 
“You And Me On The Rock” by Brandi Carlile (2022)
A remake of her award-winning “In These Silent Days,” Carlile’s album, “In The Canyon Haze,” is inspired by the folk techniques of Laurel Canyon. Notably, this included a softer, acoustic version of her hit song “You And Me On The Rock,” featuring the vocals of her wife Catherine ​​Shepherd. The re-release was motivated by Carlile’s partnership with Joni Mitchell, whose influence is apparent in this tender love song.

“There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar:
I love not man the less, but Nature more…”
So waxed Lord Byron’s “Childe Harold” about what surely has been the unspoken sentiment of many. Defined by motion and unforgiving of sloth, the demands of modernity offer but few opportunities to stop and catch one’s breath. It comes to no surprise then that we often use our brief moments of respite to mentally teleport to a fantastical world, where all is forgiven and life is a lot more simple and serene.
For those more burdened than others by the drudgery of daily life, this escapist itch is predictably stronger. Even so, there certainly lies in all of us to some degree, a tiny Mephistophelian voice that, rather than tempt with material pleasures, goads us to gleefully abandon the present.
To put it another way: How many of you have ever had the desire, however fleeting, to drop everything and take a two-week sojourn to St. Lucia?
As escaping to the Caribbean is rarely a viable course of action — at least for those of us who wish to maintain our obligations, livelihoods, and grade point averages — we naturally drift to less ambitious ways to abscond from the diktats of reality. For instance, we watch movies and television sitcoms, melding ourselves into the characters onscreen who seemingly never have to pay rent or file a W-4. Whether it’s Ross Geller or Superman, these are figures whose desires and destinies are more limited by the screenwriter’s pen than traffic or bounced checks.
Of course, we do not only find escape in following the lives of fictional others. After all, the conversations we have every day, from Sunday brunch gossip to water cooler talk and barista banter, represent some of the most potent social glues holding communities together in America. And if social interaction is ever insufficient in helping us withstand the monotony of the workweek, we can always briefly go full Byron: venturing literally into the “pathless woods” to seek Nature herself.
The various methods that humans have crafted to seek a temporary reprieve from everyday life are well-represented in artistic traditions around the world, and examples of renditions abound among Harvard’s collections. One can point to the dreamy procession of boats that Claude Monet drew at Argenteuil, conveniently leaving out the smokestacks of factories that surrounded the town in order to capture what could be real than what really was. In rougher yet similarly broad brushstrokes, John Singer Sargent’s depiction of Lake O’Hara in the Canadian Rockies balances the calmness of the water with the terrific majesty of the terrain behind it, almost as if to warn the eager adventurer, still accustomed to urban comforts, that nature is an equally loving and cruel mistress.
Lest we artificially confine ourselves to the Western canon, there are a plethora of works originating from East Asia that convey the same themes, such as Yi Jeong’s 17th century portrayal of a wizened figure seeking solace beside a lake. In fact, the entire landscape painting tradition in Tang-era China became an outlet for artists to find meaning in the natural world as political instability around them made reality devoid of it.
The longing to escape what “is” constitutes an all but natural aspect of the human condition. While the hustle and bustle of modernity may make this desire more evident, and fulfilling it more arduous, we have sought to rid ourselves of the present since the distant past. But, whether for our collective sanity or the sake of good art, that’s no reason not to keep trying.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bicycles are nimble, quick, green, and affordable. They’re even better when they fold up.
Last September, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 announced plans to add 9.4 miles of new bike lanes to the existing 84 miles of marked routes in the city. She wants 50 percent of Bostonians to be within a three-minute walk from a safe, connected bike route within three years.
Let me take Mayor Wu’s bid and raise it. Not only does Boston need more cycle lanes; the future of American cities should belong to the folding pushbike. Here’s why.
I recently moved to Boston from London. My fold-up bicycle let me connect London’s cycle lanes and public transport so I could do far more with my time. I made house calls to patients, carried my bike on buses and trains, tucked it beside me in the pub, and walked it upstairs to my flat at night.
One of the biggest folding bicycle brands in Britain is Brompton. Since a pre-production run of 60 were sold in 1982, the Brompton’s small wheels and simple geometry have become a feature of London transport as distinctive as the black cab and the red bus. The reason is clear: Folding bicycles make London more livable.
My own bike is a Brompton with three gears and mudguards. In the mornings, I rode it through Victoria Park and up the towpath on the River Lea when my visits took me to Walthamstow or Chingford.
I’ve cycled through the Alps, Dolomites, and Atlas mountains, and crossed Milan during rush hour on an old touring bike, and I feel comfortable squeezing past buses on Oxford Street. The objective is that of a cat’s whiskers or a goalkeeper: to determine what will fit a given space.
My confidence comes in part from the dense mass of riders who have fanned across central London in recent years: approximately 161,000 per day. Drivers have reason to check their mirrors and pull out carefully: There’s almost always a cyclist. The more who cycle, the safer it gets.
London currently has a Congestion Charge: a £15 daily fee for driving a car in the Congestion Charge zone, which has gradually ratcheted up the cost of driving in London. The legitimacy of this measure rests on the availability of viable public transport alternatives. Fortunately, London also has at least 9,300 buses on 675 routes and 272 stations connecting 402 kilometers of London Underground track. Rail strikes notwithstanding, the way London allows its over 9.6 million residents to get around without need of a car is central to its status as a great city.
Many American cities were designed for cars, but as Robert A. Caro demonstrates in “The Power Broker,” his vast biography of dominant New York urban planner Robert Moses, no number of additional roads and bridges have sustainably allayed New York City’s infamous congestion. Millions of Americans stew needlessly for hours in their car each day.
Public transport can be an efficient, sustainable future for America. Folding bicycles can complete the link from station to front door.
Admittedly, my folding bike, priced from $1,150, cost four times more than my first car (a Ford Fiesta bought from beneath the tree of a local farmer, its chassis long since defunct, God rest it) and is only a sensible mode of transport because the city I usually work in has decent bus and rail infrastructure. Hiring a Bluebike is an affordable alternative for Bostonians, although these bikes aren’t allowed on buses, trains, or ferries.
Those who know the mirthless comedy of traffic around Harvard Square will surely agree that life in Cambridge, Boston, New York, and across the United States would be better if more Americans cycled and fewer drove while leaning furiously on their horns.
We are past the point where we can escape or ignore the effects of climate change — your Harvard credentials will not save you from our shared life and fate. To mitigate the worst effects of the changing earth, the citizens of high-income, high-emitting countries must rapidly change the way we live. It can begin with how you get to the grocery store.
I realize that asking U.S. cities to break their motorcar addiction and deliver public transport services people actually want to use may seem as quixotic as locking your arms and back into a stickman posture to force a three-gear folding bike up a mountain. But it can be done. To stand a chance of leaving this world fit to live in for generations to come, we need to change what we invest in, where we go, and how we get there.
Is that not the road to the future? Let’s get there by bicycle.

Harvard Medical School researchers at McLean Hospital published a study demonstrating an association between race-based adversity in childhood and structural differences in brain development.
In the February issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, researchers Nathalie M. Durmonay, Lauren A.M. Lebois, Kerry J. Ressler, and Nathaniel G. Harnett published their findings of the correlation between childhood adversity experienced disproportionately by Black children in the U.S and differences in neurological development.
Assessing surveys from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, U.S. Census neighborhood data, and MRI scans of 1,786 Black children and 7,350 white children aged nine to 10, the team found small variations in gray matter volume in stress-related brain regions.
Harnett said in an interview Tuesday that the findings of this study stand in contrast to the myth that there are inherent neurological differences between people of different races.
“One of those folklore beliefs happens to be that individuals who are Black have smaller brains than individuals who are white,” Harnett said. "What our results really speak to is that really a significant portion of the differences between groups can really be attributed to adversities that these groups might experience differentially during childhood."
The study suggests that a key contributor to the disparity in gray matter volume between Black and white children is adversity disproportionately experienced by Black children. The researchers found that structural racism — including the likelihood of experiencing poverty, traumatic events, and family conflict — may affect differential development of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex.
In addition to supporting this relationship, the study has implications for future research on the relationship between experienced adversity and post-traumatic stress disorder. When analyzing earlier PTSD research in conjunction with this study, researchers observed that Black children experienced higher severity of PTSD symptoms, and “symptom severity was further predicted by adversity,” according to the study.
“I want to understand why some people end up with PTSD,” Harnett said. “I think that the brain is probably the best way to understand that and to predict who’s likely to go on to develop it.”
This research has practical implications for doctors seeking to better understand their patients’ backgrounds.
“If we want to understand where our patients are going to end up and how well they’re going to do, we really need to understand what’s been happening in their past, and how for different patients and different individuals, those different experiences might contribute to different outcomes,” Harnett said.
In the future, this group hopes to look at the same relationship over other age groups.
“The major focus for us going forward is that we really want to know, ‘What is the trajectory of development like for individuals that are experiencing more adverse childhood events?’” he said.
Harnett hopes this will help people think about how structural racism affects future generations.
“We’re really hoping that these findings motivate people to really consider widespread structural changes to address systemic inequities, to address the traumas that people can experience in childhood,” he said.

Harvard’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability announced that it is sponsoring six new student-led climate projects across campus through its Student Organization Funding Pilot Program in a Feb. 13 press release.
These student-led initiatives span a total of 13 different student organizations across six of Harvard’s schools: the College, the Business School, the Extension School, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Design, and the Law School.
The sponsored initiatives range from sustainability field trips and a new climate magazine to a plant-based food festival and a clean energy policy project. The common thread through all six initiatives, besides a focus on climate and sustainability, is collaboration, said Salata Institute Director James H. Stock.
“The purpose is to encourage student activities in the climate-sustainability space on the Harvard campus and in particular, more specifically, encourage collaboration among student groups, so that we get the students talking to each other and working together,” Stock said.
To qualify for the grant, project proposals had to involve two or more existing clubs and explain how the project will contribute to either research, education, or public engagement on climate change and related environmental issues.
Harvard Undergraduate Plant Futures Co-President Camille B. Freedman ’25, who is helping organize a plant-based food festival with the HLS Animal Law Society and the GSAS Student Center Wellness Group, said she values how the program opens the gate for undergraduates to work with students in graduate schools.
“That’s exciting to all of us, to collaborate on something together about an issue we care about,” Freedman said. “I think it’ll just bring a wider diversity of perspectives. I think it’ll make the event more successful because we have more people working on it and more people will be invited to attend.”
The HBS Sustainability Club, meanwhile, will work with the Climate Leaders Program for Professional Students to organize field trips to learn about industries focused on sustainability and climate-tech companies.
Co-President of the HBS Sustainability Club Meghavi M. Talati said the collaborative nature of the initiatives reflects the need for interdisciplinary action against climate change.
“It’s not just a business problem, but it’s a tech problem, a business problem, a regulatory problem,” Talati said. “It’s just bringing together all the different minds from different disciplines that’ll help tackle the climate problem together.”
The Harvard Undergraduate Clean Energy Group is set to use the funding to develop two HUCEG-affiliated projects — a climate literacy magazine with the College’s Resource Efficiency Program and Harvard Climate Coalition, and a clean energy policy project with Harvard Undergraduates for Bipartisan Solutions.
“Both of these projects were like the grandchildren, if you will, of two of our members,” HUCEG Co-President Carlie R. McGrath ’24 said. “It’s really cool to be able to start a project that small, and then hopefully each of them will have a large impact and continue on for multiple semesters.”
Stock said he hopes the program will help prepare students to become the “next generation of leaders” who will confront climate change.
“Climate is something that affects all the different schools and students,” Stock said. “It’s a great opportunity for people to work together.”

Harvard University Health Services received more than 25,000 virtual visits in its 2022 fiscal year, following students’ full return to campus in fall 2021, according to the healthcare provider’s annual report.
Of the roughly 116,000 patient visits to HUHS throughout the fiscal year, 23 percent were conducted virtually, the report said. Since 2020, HUHS has offered telemedicine services across 10 departments to increase accessibility during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last October, HUHS added TimelyCare — a telehealth counseling platform — to its digital offerings.
The report, which highlights HUHS’ activities from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, covers initiatives that span Harvard’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses, as well as satellite clinics at the Law School and Dillon Field House for Sports Medicine. The report, released last month, is the first in several years to be published and the first to be released digitally, according to HUHS spokesperson Tiffanie A. Green.
The report also reviewed public health measures implemented during the return to on-campus learning in fall 2021. During that time, Harvard required all affiliates to be vaccinated and boosted for Covid-19, participate in regular testing, and follow self-isolation procedures if positive.
In total, Harvard administered 1.4 million Covid-19 tests and 3,900 Covid-19 vaccines in the fiscal year. Covid-19 vaccination rates among students reached 97 percent, while 93 percent of employees were vaccinated, according to the report.
In spring 2022, HUHS retired mandatory Covid-19 testing, dissolved its contact tracing programs, and adopted a mask-optional policy.
Over the report’s period, HUHS saw 22,981 student visits to its Counseling and Mental Health Services arm, accounting for nearly one in five HUHS visits. In addition, the CAHMS Cares 24/7 mental health hotline, launched at the beginning of the reporting period, answered 2,421 calls over the year.
The report sets out diversity and inclusion as a focus area for the service, with initiatives including the recent hire of Director of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Laurie Nicholas. According to the report, 45 percent of HUHS’ 67 new full-time employees identify as ethnic minorities.
“Through campaigns, HUHS celebrates and highlights opportunities to educate the community about a diversity of backgrounds, cultures, identities and experiences,” the report reads.
In a preface introducing the report, HUHS Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen said that HUHS was “emerging from the pandemic with a renewed sense of purpose.”
“While we work toward our goals, HUHS will continue to provide outstanding service, invest in equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging, be accountable in our work, and act as responsible stewards of our resources,” he wrote.
“I am proud to be part of the HUHS team and look forward to the future with hope and determination,” Nguyen concluded.

Harvard was named a Fulbright top producing institution by the U.S. State Department for having among the highest number of accepted applications for the 2022-2023 U.S. student and scholar programs.
Twenty-nine students and recent graduates from Harvard College were selected for the student scholarship, a prestigious program allowing students to “expand perspectives through academic and professional advancement and cross cultural dialogue,” according to the Fulbright website. Seventeen of these students ultimately accepted their award.
In addition to the 29 students and recent graduates from Harvard College, seven Harvard faculty, researchers, and administrators were selected for the scholars program.
Eighteen other universities and colleges were also recognized as Fulbright dual top producing institutions alongside Harvard, making lists for both the most Fulbright students and scholars.
Among the recipients of the student scholarship was Brandon T. Chen ’22 — a recent College graduate who studied Government and is now teaching English at elementary and middle schools in Hualien County, Taiwan.
Chen, an English teaching assistant grantee, was paired with a local English instructor and teaches English to students ranging from first to ninth grade.
“It’s not like a scholarship or anything, but more like a cultural and education grant,” Chen said, in reference to his experience with the Fulbright program.
Chen wrote his government thesis on U.S.-Taiwan relations, and he characterized the Fulbright Taiwan program as a “cultural exchange” and a form of “public diplomacy between the U.S. and Taiwan.”
“A big motivation of mine is strengthening that U.S.-Taiwan relationship,” Chen said.
Chen added he was motivated to accept the teaching grant because of “increasingly aggressive and irredentist Chinese rhetoric.”
“I think striking U.S.-Taiwan relationships are more important now than ever,” Chen said.
Chen added his Taiwanese background also informed his decision to become a teaching assistant.
“I never spent much time in this country, so I wanted to experience it firsthand a little bit more,” Chen said in reference to Taiwan.
In another corner of the world, Harvard Medical School professor Anita K. Wagner is conducting global pharmaceutical policy research as the 2022-2023 U.S. Fulbright-Tampere University Scholar in Finland.
Wagner said part of what drew her to Finland was how different their pharmaceutical system is from the systems she is familiar with in the United States and other nations worldwide.
“I wanted to see how pharmaceuticals are talked about and handled in a country like Finland that has a much different definition of population welfare and population health,” she added.
Wagner said that Finland has been “number one” in the world happiness index for the past five years — another factor that drew her to the country.
“That has to do with how society is structured and how people experience it,” she added, explaining why Finland is ranked so highly.
Wagner also said she was drawn to the Fulbright program because it comported with “the big theme” of her life — “building bridges.”
“Fulbright is really an enormous opportunity for me to come back to where I started — bridge building across systems, countries, languages, cultures, disciplines, organizations,” she added.

Legal experts at an event hosted by Harvard Federalist Society on Wednesday said they believe the Supreme Court should rule in favor of Harvard in the lawsuit brought against the University by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions.
Nonetheless, panelists Guy-Uriel Charles and Jonathan F. Mitchell, as well as Harvard law professor Jeannie C. Suk Gersen — who moderated the event — agreed that they believe SFFA will prevail.
In October 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for SFFA v. Harvard, which challenges the use of race-conscious admissions in higher education admissions processes. SFFA first sued Harvard in 2014, alleging their policies discriminate against Asian American applicants.
Mitchell, the former solicitor general of Texas and an attorney at Mitchell Law PLLC, claimed that according to the textualist perspective, the SFFA argument does not have a basis in statute.
“SFFA is relying on a cause of action that is solely a creature of judicial precedent that has no textual support whatsoever,” Mitchell said.
Charles, a Harvard law professor, said the case should be examined through a different framework — a commitment to “the project of equality.”
“For me, the place to begin is to think about how, as a society, we should think about the distribution of resources, recognizing that we live in an unequal society,” Charles said.
He mentioned that an important point in this debate is determining which institutions should make decisions that affect minority groups.
“Some of you and some of us might trust the Court, some might trust Harvard, some might trust the political process, some might trust other types of entities,” he said.
“But we’re going to have to decide who we trust to make those types of decisions, and what are the types of checks and balances, both in law and politics, that enable us to think differently about the types of decisions that we’re making?”
Gersen, who last year filed a successful request for the Massachusetts District Court to unseal SFFA v. Harvard courtroom sidebars, said the case has broader implications for equal protection.
“I think that the underlying question of, what kind of society we want to have, what our commitment to equality is — what does that really look like?” she said.
The panelists also debated which branch of government should control race-conscious admissions policies: Congress or the Supreme Court.
In an interview after the panel, Brecken D. Denler, a first-year student at HLS and a member of the Harvard Federalist Society, said he thought it was “interesting to hear that all panelists agreed that Harvard should prevail in the case for different reasons.”
Denler also said he enjoyed the “broader discussion about legal realism versus legal formalism,” which he considers a “lively discussion between students at the Law School and in the profession generally.”
Alex Trivella, a third-year student at HLS, said the University has a “vested interest” in creating a diverse intellectual environment.
“If everybody in the room looks the same, grew up the same way, and doesn’t have any different experiences that might challenge the views expressed, it actually detracts from the point of a liberal arts education,” Trivella said in an interview after the event.
Many legal experts anticipate that the Supreme Court will end the use of race-conscious admissions policies in a decision expected in late spring or summer.
Correction: March 3, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Jonathan F. Mitchell claimed that according to a textualist perspective, Students for Fair Admissions’ argument does not have legal standing. In fact, Mitchell said that from a textualist perspective, SFFA’s argument lacks a basis in statute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team traveled to Big Green territory to compete in the Ivy League Heptathlon Championships. The women’s team came out victorious, with a first-place win, repeating its conference title from last year. The men’s team earned second place, falling behind Princeton by only a single point. Over its two days of competition, the Crimson accumulated 16 individual or relay titles, with runners earning a total of eight First-Team All-Ivy League honors.
“The goal was to win, to get a trophy,” said sophomore distance runner Graham Blanks about the team’s goals going into the meet. “It’s been a long time since Harvard track or cross country has won an Ivy League Trophy.”
On day one, Harvard set the tone with three first-place finishes and with both teams sitting in first place.
Up first, senior thrower Alexander Kolesnikoff won the men’s shot put, making him the first champion for the Crimson and earning him First-Team All-Ivy honors. His 19.58 m throw was over one meter farther than the rest of the shot put field. He was joined by teammate senior Sarah Omoregie, who won the women’s shot put with a throw of 16.88 m. On the pole vault, sophomore Anastasia Retsa tied for second place with a jump of 4.17 m, matching her personal best and the school record.
Junior Jaeschel Acheampong also scored some points for Harvard, taking second place in the men’s long jump for a 7.61 m mark, just a few centimeters shy of his personal best. Sophomore Izzy Goudros also took a spot on the podium, earning bronze for the women’s event for her jump of 5.87 m.
Junior Jada Johnson earned second place in two of the five women’s pentathlon events: the high jump and 800 m run. The West Roxbury, Mass. local scored a whopping 3566 points throughout all five events to increase Harvard’s score.
On the running side, the Crimson added more to the list of athletes on the podium, with one athlete earning First-Team honors and two athletes earning Second-Team All-Ivy honors.
Blanks, the current Harvard and Ivy League record holder in the 3000 m race, earned himself a championship name in the event. The Georgia native ran a time of 8:06.97, which was followed by his teammate junior Acer Iverson, who got the silver medal with a time of 8:07.82.
As well as getting marks in the scored running events, many Crimson athletes ran times that allowed them to advance to the finals.
In the 60 m hurdles preliminaries, juniors Samuel Bennet and Aaron Shirley finished in first and fifth places, respectively, to qualify for the finals. In the men’s mile, first-year Vivien Henz won his heat with a 4:10.30 post to secure a spot in the final.
In the 60 m dash, the men’s team had all four runners advance to the finals, with sophomore Lance Ward leading the team, winning his heat with a time of 6.81 seconds. He was joined by sophomore Collin Fullen, junior Jaeschel Achampeong, and first-year Jonas Clarke, the current record holder for the event.
In the men’s 400 m preliminaries, Shirley led the way, receiving a first-place finish with a time of 48.46 seconds to qualify. His teammate, senior Gregory Lapit, was less than a second behind, bagging first place in his heat with a time of 48.75 seconds.
Harvard kept pace in the 500 m, pushing sophomore Peter Diebold, first-year Justin Levy, and senior Max Serrano-Wu into the finals for the event.
For the women’s team, Harvard had some exceptional races to advance to the finals.
In the 60 m hurdles, Goudros qualified for the finals with a time of 8.62 seconds. Her teammate, first-year Josefina Biernacki, just missed the mark, taking ninth place in the preliminaries with a time of 8.82 seconds.
In the women’s mile, the school record holder, sophomore Maia Ramsden, took third place with a time of 4:50.27 seconds to advance to the finals.
Senior Tina Martin and Goudros advanced to the finals for the 60 m dash, finishing in 7.48 seconds and 7.50 seconds to take second and third places, respectively. In the 400 m, three athletes from Harvard qualified for the finals: sophomore Chloe Fair and first-years Mfoniso Andrew and Jacklynn Okerekie.
In the women’s 500 m, the school record holder, sophomore Victoria Bossong, won her heat, scooping second place overall in the preliminaries to advance with a time of 1:14.85 seconds.
On the second and final day of the Heptathlon Championships, the team earned a number of first-place and podium finishes. Harvard maintained its lead over Princeton, with the men’s team inching very close to the Tigers all day long. Throughout the meet, the number of points that the men’s team earned was crucial in order to keep the gap open between Harvard and second-place Princeton.
“I think everyone knew they had to do what was expected of them or above in order to get that trophy, and I think everyone stepped up,” said Blanks in reference to the Crimson’s performance.
Bennett won the 60 m hurdles, with a time of 7.85 seconds to earn the Crimson ten points overall. In the women’s 60 m hurdles, it was Goudros who got second place for Harvard with a time of 8.45 seconds, earning the women’s team eight points.
In the men’s 400 m finals, Lapit and Shirley finished first and second, with times of 47.92 and 47.96 seconds respectively. Their gold and silver finish earned the Harvard men’s team a combined 18 points. On the women’s side, Fair finished first, running 54 seconds flat to earn herself First-Team All-Ivy honors. Andrew joined her on the podium in sixth place with a time of 56.69 seconds, and together they earned the women’s team 11 points.
For the men’s 500 m, Diebold crossed the finish line first place in his heat with a time of 1:04.57 seconds, seemingly winning the event. However, he was edged out by three runners in the second heat, which eventually put him in fifth place. In the women’s 500 m, defending champion Bossong finished in first place, winning the event in a time of 1:12.08 seconds, earning ten points for her team.
“On day one, my main focus was to do what I needed to do to make the finals,” reflected Bossong about her preliminary race. “I ran a very conserved race and put myself in a good position for the finals the next day.”
In the men’s 60 m dash final, all four Crimson athletes got on the podium, earning the team 19 points combined. In the women’s 60 m dash final, Martin and Goudros finished second and third respectively, running 7.48 and 7.51 seconds. Their gold and silver races earned fourteen points for the women’s team.
In the women’s 1000 m final, Ramsden won the event with her time of 2:44.96 seconds, earning herself her second First-Team All-Ivy honors in the meet.
In the women’s 200 m finals, Martin scored first place with a time of 24.16 seconds, with Fair following shortly behind in second place, running 24.32 seconds, tallying another 18 points for Harvard. Blanks and Iverson also earned themselves their second First-Team All-Ivy and Second-Team All-Ivy honors of the meet, with first-place and second-place finishes in the 5000 m run, respectively.
“We were just focused on maximizing points for our team,” said Blanks about the mindset he and Iverson had going into both of their individual races that day. “The goal for each of us was to go one-two in both of them to try and get as many points as possible. It was necessary for the team if we wanted a shot at winning.”
Blanks ran a 13:53.50 to win gold, followed by teammate Iverson, who ran a 13:54.35 to win silver. These points were so crucial to the men’s team that before the race, as the margin between the Crimson men and Princeton men was a mere two points, with Harvard having the edge at 133-131. After Blanks and Iverson ran, the margin became 13 points, with Harvard in the lead.
On the throwing side, the women’s team swept the weight throw event. Sophomore Stephanie Ratcliffe threw a 21.88 m mark to win the event, followed by teammates senior Estel Valeanu and sophomore Cara Salsberry, who took second and third place, respectively. Junior Cammy Garabian joined them on the podium in sixth place, throwing a 17.89 m mark. These four athletes earned the Harvard women’s team 25 points, helping the Crimson maintain a massive grip over the rest of the teams.
In the men’s distance medley relay, the team of Iverson, junior Jonathan Gamarra, senior Riley McDermott, and Blanks ran a time of 9:57.99 to take fifth place in the event, earning the team two points. Blanks, the 3000m and 5000m meet champion, finished off the relay with the mile, running a 4:09.61 second time.
“I knew in the back of my head that I might get selected to anchor, so when Coach asked me, I just felt honored to do that,” Blanks commented. “I just wanted to get in the race and give it my all, whatever I had left.”
The women’s distance medley relay team earned second place, winning eight more points with a time of 11:28.64 seconds.
After the two events, the women’s and men’s teams still stood in first place, with Harvard’s men's team having a seven-point lead over Princeton, and the women’s team having a 59.5-point lead. Next up was the 4x800 m relay, an event crucial for the men’s team to maintain a lead over Princeton, as a first-place finish for the Tigers would give them the edge needed to win the entire meet.
Throughout the race, Harvard, Princeton, and Dartmouth all battled for first place. On the last lap, Cornell had the lead in the exchange. The Crimson seemed to be in good standing, but in a devastating moment, Harvard’s Henz was knocked over and fell during the last exchange, resulting in the drop of the baton. The team then lost its momentum, and Harvard ended up finishing seventh, not earning any points for the team, granting Princeton the first-place title. At the conclusion of the event, there was no finalization of standings, leaving the men’s team in suspense as the last baton exchange went under review by the officials.
Amidst the women’s 4x800 m run, the officials came to a conclusion about the men’s 4x800 m race scores, finalizing the win for the Tigers — this gave Princeton ten more points and solidified a three-point lead over Harvard heading into the last event of the day.
“It was pretty terrible. It was definitely very painful to watch,” said Blanks about the decision of the race. “Our destiny was out of our hands going into that last event.”
Harvard and Princeton went into the 4x400 men’s relay neck-in-neck in points standings. The last event of the day would make the difference in whether or not the men’s team would join the women’s team as Ivy League Champions. Princeton led the meet with 156 points, with Harvard trailing behind at 153.
The Harvard team was made up of Lapit, Shirley, Serrano-Wu, and Ward. The Crimson, who were the defending 4x400 m relay champion team, went into the race with incredibly high stakes. In order for Harvard to win the championship, the team would have had to win the event, and the Tigers would have to get third place or lower.
The Harvard men’s team had a consistent lead throughout the entire race and Ward, the anchor for the team, crossed the finish line in first place with a time of 3:11.59 seconds. However, the race was not enough to win them the championships, as Princeton finished second place behind the Crimson with a time of 3:12.39, giving it enough points to win the championship title.
Despite a disappointing loss, the men’s team found consolation in its support for one another.
“We went out, our guys did a fantastic job, they won the 4x400 pretty dominantly,” Blanks said. “But Princeton was able to edge right into second place by less than a second. It definitely wasn’t a fun thing to watch.”
“I think after this weekend, it’s brought the team a lot closer — to be able to support each other after a narrow loss like that is pretty necessary for the future of our program.”
Bossong added, “I felt a sense of deja vu as I watched the 4x400 relay knowing what was at stake. I was on the 4x400 relay at our past outdoor championship where the women’s team was put in a similar situation — unfortunately, both of us ended up coming one point short of winning the team title.
“I know that the guys put their all out there on the track that day, and I am confident that they will come back stronger and hungry for the Ivy League title outdoors.”
The meet concluded with the women’s 4x400 m relay, with a win for the Crimson from the team of Bossong, Goudros, Andrew, and Fair. They ran a time of 3:40.69 seconds to earn First-Team All-Ivy Honors and racked up another ten points for the Crimson. Ultimately, the women’s team defended its championship title with a score of 177 points, over 25 points higher than runner-up Princeton.
“Winning indoor championships back to back was a special moment for our entire team,” said Bossong about the women’s team defending their title. “We performed the best in our program’s history which is a testament to our hard work and dedication this year.
The men’s team fell second place to Princeton — with a deficit of one point — marking 163 points on the board, while Princeton prevailed at 164.
“The fact that we’re one point short, it shows that we took a really good shot at it,” Blanks said. “Hopefully that trophy is on borrowed time and will be in our office soon.”
At the conclusion of the meet, Harvard athletes Ratcliffe and Ikeji were named the Ivy League’s Most Valuable Field Athletes for the women’s and men’s teams, respectively. Ramsden earned the title of Ivy League Women’s Most Valuable Track Athlete.
Harvard will next compete in the IC4A/ECAC championship meet this upcoming weekend. The athletes who finish within the top 16 in the nation at this meet will get a chance to compete in the indoor track and field NCAA championships, held in Albuquerque, N.M. in mid-March.

Well, here we are again, assigning personalities to arbitrarily assigned houses. But here’s the thing: If we keep giving them personalities, one day they’ll stick. So here, have some identity in its purest form: MBTI personality types.
For reference, the MBTI works as follows:
First letter is ‘E’ for extroverted or ‘I’ for introverted.
Second letter is ‘N’ for intuitive (which is…counterintuitive) or ‘S’ for observant (um, what?).
Third letter is ‘T’ for thinking or ‘F’ for feeling.
Fourth letter is ‘P’ for prospecting or ‘J’ for judging.
If you feel like that makes no sense, you’re right. Now time to really invest in it!
Adams House: ISTP/The Virtuoso
The extremely dimly lit Gold Room is perfect for brooding, which is all ISTPs need. Plus, is it just me, or do artists disproportionately end up in Adams…?
Cabot House: ISFP/The Adventurer
Fish love to adventure. And it’s quite the adventure to reach Cabot from anywhere relevant. Worth it for Cabot Café, though?
Currier House: ISFJ/The Defender
Currier is always ~defending~ their house, so this seems apt. They also have to defend their reigning title as the best dhall on campus.
Dunster House: ESFP/The Entertainer
The Dunster dhall is…so loud. So somebody’s got to be entertaining somebody. They’re also always entertaining the athletes who swoop in at precisely 7:30 p.m. every weeknight.
Eliot House: INFJ/The Advocate
So…INFJs are supposed to be, like, mysterious. I don’t know if Eliotites are actually mysterious or if they’re just kind of stuck up. I do know, however, that a lot of them are on the Harvard Advocate, so.
Kirkland House: ESTP/The Entrepreneur
They really have to be entrepreneurial in order to figure out how to make a whole week out of every week. I cannot imagine the creative stress.
Leverett House: ESTJ/The Executive
Lev had to be one of the extroverted ones, because there are just so many people living there. And the ~executive~ function to reach the dhall from the towers? Extreme.
Lowell House: INTJ/The Architect
Recently renovated by ~architects~, Lowellians have plenty of INTJ strategic thinking to spare, because they don’t have to think strategically about when to leave their dorm to get to class on time.
Mather House: ENTJ/The Commander
Mather definitely looks pretty commanding with that phallic strong and brutalist architecture. It even commands you to walk up a whole flight of stairs to get to its dhall.
Pforzheimer House: ENTP/The Debater
Do I have to explain this one? We’ve all heard about the extremely active mailing list.
Quincy House: ENFP/The Campaigner
The People’s House is enthusiastic, optimistic, and always ready for a good time. They’re also really good at convincing you (campaigning, if you will) that it’s a good idea to hit the third party of the night when you’re ready to crawl into your nice warm bed.
Winthrop House: ENFJ/The Protagonist
Everyone in Winthrop has the worst case of main character syndrome I’ve maybe ever seen in my life. With love <3
Honorable Mentions (because there are sixteen personality types): 
Dudley: ESFJ/The Consul
The Co-op: INFP/The Mediator
The Yard: INTP/The Logician
Sleeping in Lamont all the time: ISTJ/The Logistician (which is somehow different than the logician)
Actually, writing this piece has convinced me that the MBTI is all made up. But just in case it’s not, keep these in mind on that fateful Thursday. Happy housing season!

Snowy weather and frigid temperatures aside, I’d say spring semester has been full of surprises and excitement. From the new HUDS upgrade to a mild(ish) winter, there must be something in the air. And there’s only so much more to come, including one of the largest student-run productions on campus: Harvard Ghungroo! Don’t know what Ghungroo is? Want to learn all about it from the directors themselves? Say less, that’s what we’re here for. We sat down with two of Ghungroo’s directors, Sarah R. Ramberran ’24 and Shraddha Joshi ’24, to give you all the inside deets and why you should all go see the show!
TC: Can you give us a brief rundown of Ghungroo and what it is?
SJ: Ghungroo is a South Asian cultural showcase. We have dance, music, skit, and spoken word, and it’s the largest student-run production at Harvard. It’s a celebration of South Asian culture and its diaspora.
SRR: So we start preparing for Ghungroo, really, in the summer, and then we start doing back-end work in the fall semester, and in the spring semester, we actually get our residency in the [Agassiz Theater]. That’s when the set goes up, and that’s when people really start practicing their dances and music acts.
TC: Could you go into what goes into Ghungroo?
SRR: There’s many departments. What we see is skit, dance, music, acts, and spoken word. There’s a lot of preparation that goes into planning those acts, figuring out what is the plot for skit, people preparing their spoken word acts, and then dance.
SJ: Basically for context, we have a tech team of almost a hundred people and 350+ performers from across the College. In terms of dances, we have eight regular dances, which are the non-senior dances, and they’re different regional styles from across South Asia and then also pan-regional styles, such as Underground, which is a new act that we have this year that is focused on hip-hop, and then we also have cinema, etcetera. And then we have senior dances, which are separate from the dances that freshmen, sophomores, and juniors perform in, and those are a back-to-back succession of seven dances, typically similar styles as the regular dances. And then this year we have six music acts, and each one is either a different regional style or it’s something classical and different sorts of styles from South Asia.
SRR: Our tech team is called G-Tech, and so through the year, we try to build a nice community, especially for freshmen, and for everyone else it’s a great time for people to come together and have a lot of fun and put on a show, which I think is really gratifying at the end.
SJ: To talk about the set, because this is the stuff that isn’t performed, obviously we have a pretty intensive set, and there’s a lot of people that also contribute to that, whether they’re the ones actively designing it or if they come in as an organization or as a group of friends to paint and stuff.
SRR: I think that Set and Build, those are the departments that you don’t really get to see on show day, but I think they deserve a lot of credit because the acts are one thing, and then the set is another thing. The visual aspect is great.
SJ: And it’s often sometimes the most work.
TC: What are the best parts of directing Ghungroo?
SJ: I think it would be the night before dress rehearsal, which is really when everything is going to come together, because we get to see the show in one go. But I think for me personally, one of the best parts is just seeing people who may have not really been involved in these spaces before just pitching ideas, like “Oh, I wanted to have this music act” and then now seeing that music act on stage, and now it’s a reality or people who haven’t really been as involved before are coming in for paint nights and stuff like that. I think just seeing really small anecdotes of a community coming together is what makes the work of being a director feel really meaningful, and it’s just really humbling to be part of something that’s super big because I think when you’re in the Ag every day, you’re interacting with the same small group of people. When you see people just come in and feel really excited, feel a sense of ownership over Ghungroo, that’s kind of what makes me feel really grateful to be part of it.
SRR: I really love when, towards the end of our residency, people come in, and they start practicing, and like tech rehearsal was great. I think when you actually see the acts on stage with the lights and the sound, and you're like, ‘wow, everything is finally coming together.’ I think just seeing the dances, I personally love senior dance. I think that was one of the greatest things I've seen. And I think just being here and seeing people come in and out. It’s just such a great feeling to know people are really doing this because they want to do it. This is the 35th year of Ghungroo. So I think just seeing we are part of something that is much older than us and we are kind of continuing this and people enjoy it. And I think it’s great to know that people still love doing it and they look forward to it.
TC: If Ghungroo was any HUDS dish, which one would it be? No explanation needed.
SRR: The postickers. The edamame potstickers.
SJ: I was going to say the Chicken Vindaloo, because I think we aspire towards South Asian-ness but we also have our own flair that’s influenced by our circumstances.
TC: As show day approaches, what keeps you guys motivated through late night rehearsals?
SRR: Oh my gosh, I had a dream about Ghungroo. And in the dream, I was in the hallway, right there, and I heard the audience roaring, and I just can’t wait to hear the audience, because they all love it, every show, even if it is Thursday night or Saturday night. The audience is always so engaged, and I just can’t wait to see them enjoy the show.
SJ: I think for me, just running into people who are just like “Oh, how’s Ghungroo going” or like “We’re so excited to come see” or “I’m part of organizations that, you know, might not have a lot of South Asians in them, but now they’re dancing in Ghungroo this year because they feel really excited about it.” I’ll walk into a space and see people wearing Ghungroo sweatshirts and stuff. It feels like it’s a culture that so many people share beyond just the people that I know immediately, and I think that palpable energy in the air is definitely something that keeps me going.
TC: Three words for why we should all go see the show?
SRR: South Asian party!
SJ: Do it for the community!
