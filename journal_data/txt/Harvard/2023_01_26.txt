After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is something about calling myself a golfer that feels deceptive. When I’m at home, I play golf with my friends or family a few times a month. I’ve been learning the game since I was seven years old, but despite years of practice and effort, I’d still only consider myself average. Golf will likely never be more than a hobby to me, and so to say that I am a “golfer” feels misleading. I feel as though it comes with an expectation that I compete, I’m successful, or it has become my career — though most dictionaries simply define the word as someone who plays golf.
This dilemma is shared with other terms, like “artist.” If someone tells me that they are an artist, I begin to speculate that they study art in school, contribute their work to shows or competitions, or maybe even have their work displayed or sold. The answer to what such a term implies is complicated. “When can I call myself an artist,” entered into Google, yields hundreds of millions of varying opinions.
Is it enough to be just average (or maybe even terrible) at something for it to be a part of your identity?
Attending a prestigious university like Harvard, where an acceptance letter is an acknowledgement and celebration of the ways in which one is excellent, exacerbates this dilemma for students here. The procedural emphasis on excellence seems to drown out the importance of hobbies, extracurriculars, and interests that were not notable enough to make the “activities list” on the Common App.
A student’s identity here — as it relates to hobbies or activities —  is largely made up of the things they succeed at. Examples of this are athletes who have typically gone through a recruiting process to join varsity teams, or participants in a number of clubs on campus who have completed a competitive “comp” process to join. These barriers to participation in extracurriculars contribute to existing rhetoric that the things worth our time, effort, and energy are those that we are already good at, or have found previous success in.
Despite elements of societal and Harvard-specific cultures that push individuals to identify with the things they have success in, there is immense value in challenging oneself to appreciate and continue to pursue the passions at which they are average, or even terrible.
We gain a certain freedom when we lower expectations of our performance. Performance anxiety can pervade our experience in athletics, education, and other types of competitive environments. Especially at Harvard, where students often crave success in school, a sport, or another extracurricular, this pressure from oneself to excel is common. When we have activities in our lives from which we do not expect perfection, we relieve pressure from ourselves so that we can truly enjoy these activities, instead of worrying about performance.
I practice this freedom by not always keeping score when I golf; removing the pressure of tracking performance allows me to enjoy the company of friends and family, and truly focus on the experience instead of how each bad shot might affect my score. Author and self-proclaimed “professional preacher of the gospel of suckitude” Karen Rinaldi argues a similar point in an opinion piece about her experience surfing: “By taking off the pressure of having to excel at or master an activity, we allow ourselves to live in the moment.”
Relieving ourselves of performance expectations might make participating in activities more enjoyable, but is it worth carving out time for these low-stress hobbies? An article from the New York Times claims that yes, engagement in hobbies for leisure has psychological and physical benefits, citing a study from 2009. Maintaining a hobby has further been said to improve an individual’s mental health and general wellbeing.
Besides a number of health benefits, allowing passions that we may not have attained excellence in to hold importance in and remain an active part of our identities — like golf in my own life — is a powerful stance against a culture that is fixated on excellence. It is unlikely that there will be a large-scale shift in Harvard’s culture: The University will likely continue to admit high-achieving and talented students, so it remains up to each of us to hold a mindset in which failure is okay. It is up to you to remember that you are more than your greatest talents and achievements: You are more than what you are good at.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A sepia ectoplasm of leaf imprints is caked onto the concrete blocks of a bridge dedicated to a dead man. As students, we interact with the John Weeks Bridge regularly, but we never stop to consider the history the structure holds. Scuff marks hint at footsteps that once thundered there, as ephemeral as the leaves that once lay on the drying cement. Scattered stories are the only scraps of vestigial proof we have to document the thousands of people who walked across, ritually jumped off, and fell in love on this bridge.
The little secrets ensconced on the Weeks footbridge belie a greater one: why it’s there. Rather than being built as a quaint pedestrian thoroughfare, it was constructed in 1926 for the far more utilitarian purpose of funneling steam over to the Business School. An ever-expanding Harvard needed a new method to bring heat from what is now the Blackstone plant on the Cambridge side to their facilities on the Allston side. The bridge was ultimately built as a way to extend their sprawling network of steam tunnels.
This means that the landmark’s hollow brick facade conceals a secret passageway. A damp, dimly lit wooden walkway rises and falls with the three swooping arches and compresses into a crawl space at each of their apices. Staircases and sets of steel doors sandwich either end, leading into other recesses of the tunnel system. Scalding hot pipes snake along the sides, carrying vapors that typically exceed 400 degrees Fahrenheit. The space simultaneously seems sweltering from the steam and cold from the grimy liquid on the ground. Graffiti immortalizing past generations adorns the sticky walls, and the stuffy smell of stale air permanently lingers throughout the cramped corridor.
The names and illustrations scribbled on the sides of the tunnel reside as relics of an era when this forgotten world was far more accessible. Intrepid undergrads could venture down through trapdoors on the abutments and into the passageway. Homeless Cantabrigians would often go down there to find a warm, quiet shelter from the rough New England weather. What is a mere memory to us today was once an open secret around campus.
The Weeks tunnel began to be forgotten 60 years ago when security was tightened across the steam tunnels following a series of break-ins. The College started to see the space as a liability and security risk, and wanted to keep out both nosy students and the unhoused. Any information about the tunnels was carefully withheld from the public, and knowledge of it became diluted with every cohort of graduates.
Today, the only indications that the bridge might be more than a pretty structure are the heavy, internally padlocked metal panels interspersed at periodic intervals along its surface. We don’t question their purpose any more than we take time to marvel at the haunting, faded oak leaf impressions nearby.
Although this particular portal to the past has passed into obscurity, the John Weeks Bridge continues to be a conduit for our collective memories. As an important social hub on campus, it constantly serves as a catalyst for the creation of new stories, stories that will one day also be forgotten. Inherently a point of transition, the bridge stands as a testament of the transience and impermanence of the college experience.
Nevertheless, it is important to appreciate the remnants of history that we can salvage. Weeks Bridge also exists as a reminder to take a deeper look at what we’ve written off as commonplace or mundane. Every building, street, and landmark on campus holds a secret, and it’s up to us to uncover them. In doing this, we stop taking things for granted and learn to better value what we have before our transient college experience too comes to an end.

Asking a college student their opinion on trigger warnings is a quick litmus test for their views on the shifting norms in academia and in classrooms. In my experience, many proponents of trigger warnings believe discomforting texts deserve less attention, and in classes where they must be read, special attention must be paid to the mental health of students. Those in opposition claim that content warnings exemplify the “coddling of the American mind” and the younger generations’ unwillingness to grapple with unsavory ideas. Yet this dichotomy need not exist: If we alter our understanding of trigger warnings, we will find that they are perfectly compatible with an intellectually challenging and contentious academic environment.
There aren’t extensive amounts of peer-reviewed studies on the psychological effects of trigger warnings, but there are some. Benjamin W. Bellet, a Harvard graduate student of psychology, has published two papers on content warnings in the past couple of years. His first study used participants with no history of trauma or PTSD. Roughly half of the participants in the study received a trigger warning before reading a disturbing literary passage, while the control group forged ahead with no such warning. Bellet found that trigger warnings had no significant effect on anxiety levels except for increasing anxiety among participants who had a “strong belief that words could harm them.” A second study used similar methods with participants who had experienced trauma or suffered from PTSD. Again, participants who received trigger warnings were no less anxious than their counterparts without.
Immediately after Bellet published his first findings, some commentators were quick to overstate the results. For some later commentators, Bellet’s second study contained enough evidence to condemn trigger warnings as a pseudoscientific overreach on college campuses. However, the results of the studies themselves should not be surprising. It would be an oddity if trigger warnings reduced anxiety; they are warnings, after all, not an antidote to psychologically distressing texts and images. These attacks on trigger warnings miss their true purpose: to create autonomy for students who have experienced trauma.
Trigger warnings give students the option to avoid texts they might find too difficult to critically engage with. For extreme levels of trauma, this shouldn’t be controversial. Students with personal connections to sexual assault and suicide deserve warnings and the option to disengage with texts that discuss or illustrate these topics.
As with all useful tools, the use of trigger warnings can become excessive. Just this month, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland came under fire for posting a trigger warning before a ballet performance; the university warned students about the violent death of a puppet. Beyond spoiling the plot of the show, this frivolous misuse of trigger warnings detracts from the important and necessary work they do for students suffering from trauma. Such illegitimate use of content warnings justly opens the floodgates of criticism and risks transforming a tool for traumatized students into a political baton.
Many attacks on trigger warnings do not stem from a disregard for students who have PTSD or related disorders; they stem from what are, in my opinion, very real concerns of sensitivity on college campuses. In 2016, Currier House removed a Housing Day video that contained a parody of then-presidential candidate Donald J. Trump. Although the video was initially approved by Currier’s Faculty Deans, several students complained that the inclusion of Donald Trump — even a satirical blonde-wigged version of him — was offensive. The video made no mention of Trump’s political views. A town hall was called, and a new Housing Day video was made. The saga, with its clear overreaction, speaks to the concerning culture of catastrophization at Harvard.
It is important that we do not tie up trigger warnings in arguments about what content should be allowed on campus. I am a firm believer in reading difficult texts and analyzing upsetting images, so long as they serve an educational purpose. Last month, I visited Yad Vashem in Israel, one of the world’s largest Holocaust museums. The photos I saw deeply disturbed me; I found it difficult to think of anything else for the next couple of days. Yet the unsettling experience was transformational. The expression “never again” is commonly used to describe the lessons learned from the Holocaust. As decades pass, the phrase naturally loses its emotional salience. The images at Yad Vashem, unlike statistics and idioms, are deeply affecting. To understand certain parts of history, it takes being disturbed.
Any inspiring college education must include texts that offend modern norms. Engaging with uncomfortable, perhaps even evil, ideas is the only way to affirm our moral progress. Harvard — for better or for worse — is educating future political and thought leaders of the world. Many graduates of the College will have to make heavy and wide-ranging decisions. The real world is not curated for emotional stability. As such, a drive to engage with difficult material in the classroom should be a cornerstone of pedagogy at Harvard.
Sensitivity may be rising in tandem with trigger warnings on college campuses, but it remains important not to conflate the two. Trigger warnings serve to protect the autonomy of students with histories of trauma. It would be a mistake to abandon them because of a few errant examples of overreach. We have to affirm a culture of reading and discussing difficult works, with trigger warnings serving as a tool for this end, rather than an obstacle.

UPDATED: January 26, 2023, at 3:50 p.m.
Cambridge Public Schools established sacred spaces at each campus for students and staff to practice regular religious prayers, becoming the first public school district in New England to do so.
The initiative — detailed in a Monday press conference — launched last November and comes as the district works to foster increased equity and inclusion. CPS, which encompasses 17 schools and more than 6,000 students, began to offer halal meal options in school lunches in 2020. Last year, CPS also became the first public school system in the United States to officially recognize a Muslim holiday, Eid al-Fitr.
Even as the district made these advances, however, Muslim students and staff still had limited options for spaces to practice daily prayers. Zakkiyya Witherspoon, a confidential assistant in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, said she and other Muslim colleagues at times resorted to using closet space to pray. The experience led her to establish the Muslim Community of CPS with colleagues.
“For Muslims, we have an obligation to pray. It’s not something that we do just for recreation — it’s something that we’re required to do,” Witherspoon said. “When that space is not available to us, when we do have to sneak around or pray in closets, some Muslims forfeit the prayer.”
Selam Anwar, a senior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, recounted a similar experience of her own. She usually performs prayers in rooms of teachers she knows, but said that seeking out places to pray is “nerve-wracking.”
“The most tricky part was honestly finding a space just because, at times, even teachers’ classrooms, they might be on a break so they might have their doors locked, so I can’t go in,” she said.
In response to the lack of spaces for prayer, Witherspoon approached the CPS Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging, which helped her organization advocate for sacred spaces throughout the district. Both students and staff can access these spaces at every campus throughout CPS. Witherspoon said the change has provided her “great comfort,” and she hopes that other districts will adopt similar practices for the sake of the students and their workforce.
“It is a right of Muslims to be able to pray in the workplace, where employers are supposed to make reasonable accommodations for religious practice to remove any undue harm,” Witherspoon said. “We should be able to come to work and perform our duties at work and also perform our religious obligations.”
Adelina R. Escamilla-Salomon, a Cambridge Rindge and Latin senior and a school committee student representative, said that while she is proud of Cambridge for setting an example, the measure is “long overdue.”
“People shouldn’t have to go out of their way and find an empty space and feel stressed or worried about being able to fulfill their religious responsibilities,” she said.
Although Anwar said she appreciates the establishment of sacred spaces, she said she needs “a little more information” on where to access such places on her campus.
CPS spokesperson Dana M. McLaughlin wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that students can ask their school’s family liaison or clerk for information on finding the spaces.
Sachi J. Kirby ’26, a Cambridge Rindge and Latin graduate, said she believes sacred spaces are a “positive addition to the schools” and supports more resources for all religious groups.
“I think it would be interesting to have more education on different kinds of religious beliefs that we might find in the area and even ways to respect, but also uplift one another’s backgrounds and cultures,” she said.
Correction: January 26, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Cambridge Public Schools established sacred spaces on its campuses on Monday. In fact, CPS established these spaces in late November and detailed the initiative in a Monday press conference.

Khan Academy founder Salman Khan told attendees of a Harvard Graduate School of Education webinar that banning artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT in schools is the “wrong approach,” calling the service “transformative” for the future of education.
The HGSE hosted Khan Wednesday afternoon as part of its Education Now webinar series, which aims to address the evolving state of education following changes brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. The webinar was hosted by Uche B. Amaechi ’99, an education lecturer at HGSE.
“I think there’s a huge artificial elephant in the room,” Khan said of ChatGPT. “This is going to be transformative for potentially what platforms like Khan Academy can do, but also transformative for what education becomes.”
Khan referenced a recent decision by the New York City Department of Education to ban the chatbot — which provides detailed AI-generated responses to user-inputted text prompts — over academic dishonesty concerns, calling the move a “knee-jerk reaction” to the new tool.
“Should we be banning it for schools where this might be one of the hottest jobs of the future?” Khan said, referencing the growing AI industry.
Khan cited six-figure salary offerings from AI companies for prompt engineers, who help train language models like ChatGPT to better assist users.
“The jobs of the future are going to be dramatically transformed by this,” Khan said. “People should not hide from it. They should play with it, they should embrace it, and see how we can navigate the future with it.”
Khan compared the emergence of ChatGPT in schools to the launch of Khan Academy’s own service in 2008, explaining that new education technologies can support rather than threaten the traditional classroom experience.
“There’s all sorts of things that you as a human being in the classroom can do that Khan Academy at that time does not do,” Khan said. “It helped instill in the teachers’ minds, ‘Well, I’ve got even more value as an educator. I don’t have to give the same canned lecture.’”
Khan also recommended schools continue to offer remote or hybrid learning options following the lifting of pandemic restrictions, though he added that the educational experience is “generally better in-person.”
“We have refugees from Ukraine, from Syria, using Khan Academy as they go from refugee camp to refugee camp. It’s able to stay with them, they don’t lose their progress,” Khan said. “There’s a lot of benefits for having, what I would call, this almost safety net of online.”
Khan said AI could open up a “whole new zone of opportunity” for students, referencing experiences his son and daughter had creating stories using ChatGPT.
“It was an incredible experience for my eight-year-old son. He felt empowered. He felt like a writer. He felt like an editor,” Khan said. “That’s the really exciting opportunity that as educators, we have to be exploring.”

Harvard Law School announced a gift of $500,000 to the Royall House and Slave Quarters on Wednesday as part of a continued effort to recognize the University’s historical ties to slavery.
The Royall House and Slave Quarters, a museum in Medford, Massachusetts, is located on the former plantation of the Royall family, which was the largest slaveholding family in the state. At least 60 enslaved people lived on the plantation, and their forced labor contributed to the Royall’s fortune.
Isaac Royall Jr. bequeathed an endowed professorship in 1781 that became Harvard’s first professorship of law and the forerunner of the Law School. In 2016, HLS retired its school seal — which contained the Royall family’s crest — due to its connections to slavery. The school unveiled a new seal in 2021 and permanently retired the Royall Professorship of Law last year.
According to the school’s press release, HLS and Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences aim to work with the Royall House and Slave Quarters on “future research and educational programming” and facilitate visits by Harvard affiliates to the site “for reflection, learning, and research.”
In recent years, Harvard has worked to study and confront the role slavery played in its rise to prominence. The University released its landmark Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery report in April 2022, which includes mentions of Isaac Royall Jr. and the Royall family’s connections to the University.
The report also acknowledged HLS professor Janet E. Halley’s research into Isaac Royall Jr. in 2008, which inspired students to advocate for the Law School’s seal to be changed.
HLS Dean John F. Manning ’82 said in the press release that the school has “grappled with the painful history” of its origins.
“Our work with the Royall House and Slave Quarters will help us continue together to acknowledge, learn from, and share with others our complicated history, to honor and commemorate the enslaved people whose labor generated wealth that contributed to the establishment of our law school, and to better understand and address the ongoing legacy of slavery in today’s society,” Manning said.
Kyera Singleton, the executive director of the Royall House and Slave Quarters, said in the release that she hopes the Law School’s donation to the museum will help educate more people about “how the legacies of slavery impact communities, particularly Black communities and communities of color, today.”
“To understand contemporary society, we all must contend with the history of slavery and the institutions it founded and shaped in our own backyards,” Singleton said.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 promised to overhaul the city’s urban planning strategy and build more affordable housing during her first State of the City address on Wednesday evening.
Wu laid out her agenda for the coming year at the ​​MGM Music Hall in Fenway, with several thousand people in attendance. Massachusetts Governor Maura T. Healey ’92 — who was inaugurated earlier this month — was present for the event, along with many Boston city officials.
During her speech, Wu outlined her plan for abolishing the Boston Planning and Development Agency, which oversees the city's major real estate development projects. Wu has criticized the BPDA for its role in what she described as “neighborhood destruction” since her mayoral campaign.
“Over the last decade, Boston saw the largest building boom in generations: cranes in the sky, jobs on the ground,” Wu said. “But that growth wasn’t harnessed for the benefit of all our communities.”
Wu announced that she will sign an executive order on Thursday to establish an advisory council to “shift planning efforts from the BPDA to a new city planning and design department.” The advisory council will be led by James A. Jemison, Boston’s chief of planning, according to Wu.
“Not planning for community stability meant that even as our population grew, many were squeezed out,” Wu said. “Not planning for affordability and transit meant that housing prices soared and traffic snarled. Not planning for sustainability meant that as new development reshaped our skyline, public infrastructure continued to age.”
Wu also discussed plans for implementing her Green New Deal agenda, another campaign trail promise.
She pledged to phase out the use of fossil fuels in public housing developments by 2030 and said she will sign an executive order requiring all new construction and major renovations in Boston schools, municipal buildings, and public housing to be “entirely fossil fuel free.”
Wu also touted her administration’s accomplishments in her first year as mayor, emphasizing efforts to eliminate fares on three MBTA bus lines and improve the living conditions of unhoused people in Mass and Cass.
“In so many other cities, none of this would have been possible, but Boston has never let anyone else define our possibilities,” Wu said. “It is thanks to the people of Boston that I can stand here tonight and say: the state of our city is strong.”
Wu also used the address to recognize difficulties city workers have faced throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Omicron spiked and pushed our hospitals to the brink,” she said. “We didn’t turn away from taking decisive action for public health because no matter the backlash, Boston will never compromise on protecting our people.”
Wu concluded her nearly 30-minute-long speech with a reflection on her tenure as mayor, saying the job can “feel surreal and stressful, exhausting and empowering.”
“But more than anything, it feels like a gift to be able to get up every day and go to work for the city I love, with people who love it too,” Wu added.

Cambridge City Councilors sparred over whether the Cambridge Police Department should implement body cameras and what role the Council should play in regulating the department at a special meeting Wednesday on the police killing of Sayed Faisal.
The nearly three-hour session — a continuation of last week’s special hearing — was switched to an online format the day after protesters stormed Cambridge City Hall to demand justice for Faisal. Despite the virtual gathering, dozens protested on the city hall steps, chanting and waving signs reading, “Jail All Racist Killer Cops,” and “Accountability Now.”
Faisal, a 20-year-old University of Massachusetts Boston student and Cambridge resident, was shot and killed by a Cambridge Police Department officer on Jan. 4. The fatal shooting remains under investigation by the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office, but without body camera footage of the shooting, many questions about its circumstances linger.
Unlike neighboring Boston and Somerville, Cambridge has not instituted body cameras for police officers. Some demonstrators at recent protests in the wake of the shooting have called for CPD to adopt body cameras, while others said they were concerned about increasing police funding to support their implementation.
These debates were reflected in Wednesday’s Council meeting, in which councilors clashed over whether to take up a policy order calling for the use of body cameras by CPD.
“My support for body cameras is not because I necessarily think that it’s going to lead to a particularly different outcome, but it really is about transparency and accountability,” said Councilor Marc C. McGovern.
Six councilors said they supported implementing body cameras. One councilor, Quinton Y. Zondervan, expressed opposition, citing privacy concerns.
“For the most part, they do not solve the problems that we are discussing here today,” Zondervan said. “What’s happening is a systemic problem with policing and with our approach to community safety, and unfortunately, body cameras don’t really address that.”
The implementation of body cameras has been “a topic of conversation for several years now,” CPD Commissioner Christine A. Elow said during the Wednesday meeting.
City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 noted that the city last explored requiring body cameras for officers in 2020 and the previous initiative could provide a foundation for a body camera program.
Elow said though obstacles remain for the implementation of body cameras, she is open to the idea of using them.
“Cameras are a valuable tool. They enhance transparency, accountability, and build community trust,” Elow said. “Body cameras are correlated with reductions of abuses of force and reduces citizens’ complaints.”
Zondervan also proposed compensation from the city to the family of Faisal. Huang said that any compensation would require a legal settlement.
Following the discussion of compensation, Councilor Paul F. Toner said he was concerned that the discussion was falling outside of the Council’s purview.
“In my opinion, the City Council is going way beyond the realm of our role,” Toner said. “I’m not here to run the police department. I’m not here to make the decisions for the Commissioner.”
“I do think we have a wonderful department,” he added.
Zondervan closed the meeting with a contentious response to Toner.
“I appreciate and understand that the rage of this conversation may be making him uncomfortable,” Zondervan said. “I do urge him to review our code of ordinances, where the City Council has complete purview and jurisdiction over our police department.”
“I also urge him to respect my First Amendment rights to speak about whatever I feel like,” he added.

Harvard men’s basketball (12-8, 3-3 Ivy) knows the difference a single possession can make.
Last season, the Crimson narrowly missed out on the opportunity to compete in the Ivy League Tournament due to a series of defeats, such as the heartbreaking 74-73 loss to Princeton that ultimately sealed Harvard’s fate.
The start of the 2022-23 Ivy League season has demonstrated that the margins are as fine as ever — four of the six games the Crimson has played against teams in the Ivy have been decided in the dying moments of the second half.
Following its final home game of 2022, a 66-54 loss to Howard, Harvard kicked off a six-game away stretch with match-ups against UC Irvine (13-6) and No. 4 Kansas (16-4).
The road trip gave the Crimson the opportunity to compete with one of the best teams in the country, the University of Kansas, at the legendary Allen Fieldhouse. Despite losing to the Jayhawks 68-54, Harvard pushed its opponents the entire game, remaining within two possessions of a lead with just under four minutes on the clock.
“We recognized how talented and good they are, especially here in this building,” reflected head coach Tommy Amaker after the game.
“I thought our kids fought tooth and nail. I thought we made momentum plays when we had opportunities to cut into the lead to stay within striking distance.”
Returning to the East Coast, the Crimson pulled out a dramatic 74-73 overtime win against the University of Maine before heading to Princeton to start the Ivy League season. Harvard lost 69-66 to the Tigers, setting the tone for what has been a season of tense matchups decided by just a few points.
Alternating between victories and defeats, the Crimson next beat Brown in a dramatic 70-68 overtime thriller, before falling 58-54 to Yale. On its return to Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard convincingly beat Columbia 73-51, before a one-point 60-59 loss to Dartmouth. The Crimson returned to winning ways with a high scoring 95-89 win over Cornell on January 21st.
The Crimson’s offensive output has varied dramatically game-to-game. Harvard has often had to rely upon superior finishing inside of the paint to compensate for poor three-point shooting.
Coach Amaker acknowledged the team’s offensive struggles after the 58-54 loss to Yale but praised the team’s mentality.
“I was really proud of our team's effort of battling and fighting to give us a chance to be in the game late when we obviously shot the ball incredibly poorly, especially from three. Our effort was there,” Amaker said.
Despite its challenges, the Crimson’s most recent game against Cornell showcased the offensive efficiency the team has the potential to display. The Crimson scored a season-high 95 points with impressive efficiency, shooting 32 of 53 (60.4%) from the field including 10 of 18 (55.6%) from three-point range (well above the league average of 33.8%).
It’s difficult to pinpoint the difference across the team’s inconsistent offensive performances. After the game against Cornell, junior co-captain Sam Silverstein accredited the win to team chemistry.
"This game, more than any the whole season, we stuck together as a unit – all five guys on the floor, coaches, and the subs that came in and had big contributions,” the point guard said.
“Games against Cornell can get wild, but we trusted each other and stuck with it."
Defensively, the Crimson have remained solid this season with the second-lowest number of points allowed per game in the league.
Senior forward Chris Ledlum continues to be a difference-maker on the court. After missing most of last year’s Ivy League season due to injury, Ledlum has averaged a team-high of 19.1 points per game this season, ranking second in the Ivy League in the number of points scored.
When asked about the secret behind his consistency on the court, Ledlum humbly credits his teammates for putting him in the right positions.
“It’s really just my teammates. They trust me and find me in good spots. They've been trusting me, we've been trying a lot of stuff and it’s been working,” said Ledlum after the Crimson’s riveting victory against the second-ranking team in the Ivy League, Cornell.
In addition to his prowess as one of the best offensive players in the league, Ledlum is a leader for the team in all areas of play – he also leads the Ivy League in rebounding with an average of six per game, and he consistently breaks up opponents’ plays with 33 steals so far on the season.
The Crimson has also benefited from the return to full health of junior forward Justice Ajogbor, whose physical dominance is making an impact in his first full season for Harvard.
During the start of the 2021-22 season, the Crimson missed the presence Ajogbor offers near the rim and suffered in certain games by being out-rebounded by opponents. Since then, Harvard has improved its rebound margin from -0.5 to 5.0. Ajogbor is second in the Ivy League statistics for blocks per game, having recorded 32 so far this season.
First-year forward Chisom Okpara has also continued to impress, averaging 7.3 points and 3.6 rebounds a game. What's more, sophomore guard Evan Nelson recorded a career-high seven assists in the team’s victory over Cornell.
The Crimson currently sits fourth in the Ivy League standings, where it occupies the last of four qualifying spots for the Ivy March Madness tournament.
When asked after Saturday’s win against Cornell about the team’s objectives moving forward, Ledlum had no hesitation, saying that “the goal is an Ivy Championship and we’re gonna keep working hard every day.”
Next up for the Crimson is a face-off against Ivy foe Penn on the Quakers’ turf this Saturday at 2:00 p.m. EST.

Now that the excitement of the FDOC is over, we unfortunately have to break the news to you: there’s a whole semester of classes ahead of us now. Apparently, we all attend an academic institution where the goal is to…learn? But worry not, we’ve got you covered. Here are some of our tips and tricks to ensure that we’re all going to be academic weapons this semester.
Read your syllabus
Just do it. You’ll thank us and yourself later. Now you can stop worrying about writing a five-page essay for the discussion post that only counts for participation points. You can also know when to start studying for the exam that counts for 50 percent of your final grade…
Use your Google calendar
What’s not to love? So many colors. Be obnoxious about it. “I’ll put you in my GCal.” “Yea, just send me a GCal invite.” “If it’s not in my GCal, it doesn’t exist.” Sure, you may get a few eye-rolls here and there, but hey, just embrace the GCal culture. It really will make life so much easier.
Don’t overcommit yourself 
Right now, you still remember the version of you that had enough time to binge all nine seasons of The Office twice over winter break. You just had a month to yourself and now that you’re back, homework still hasn’t picked up yet. But just you wait, in three weeks, you’ll be slammed with work — so don’t say yes to nine clubs, three comps, seven jobs, one remote internship, two lab positions and eight classes. Again, you’ll thank us later.
Bundle up
Unlike the fall semester, the spring semester is filled with snow storms, hail, slush, and your hair freezing when you go outside right after a shower. Is this your first Cambridge winter? Refer to Flyby’s Guide To Surviving Your First Real Winter right now. Make sure to wear several layers, check the weather before you go out, and save your toes from the cold with warm, fuzzy socks.
Self-care comes first
From yoga to face masks to walks by the Charles River to going out for a bite with some friends, self-care can look like a variety of things. Whenever you feel like you need it, take some time for yourself. Take that mental health day. When it gets hard, remember to prioritize yourself and your inner calm first. The pset will get done, the extensions you asked for will be approved, and Flyby will always manifest the best for you.
Go outside (even if it’s cold) and catch some sun (even if there’s snow on the ground) 
Yes, yes, we know. We started the semester with three different types of precipitation on the first day. And yes, we know. New England winter doesn’t exactly scream sun. But sunshine gives you serotonin, serotonin makes you happy, and happy people don’t fail their classes — they just don’t. :)
Whether you’re a first-year eager to bounce back from the fall or a senior scrambling to finish their thesis, we hope that with these tips, there won’t be anything you can’t face this semester (except maybe finding affordable SZA concert tickets). It’s time to get out there and ace this semester!
