After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
¿Dondé está el Jardín de Pulpos? ¿Qué es el teatro debajo la arena? Doesn’t make sense? Don’t worry. Producer Francisco N. Alvarez ’11 and director Gabriela Bortolamedi ’10 will show you everything.
The Harvard College TEATRO’s newest production, playwright Arístides Vargas’ “Jardín de Pulpos,” presents the fantastical world of a Latin American man’s lost past and his dreams that make it come back alive. Set in an imagined “theatre under the sand,” “Jardín de Pulpos,” which translates as “Octopus’ Garden,” will run in the Adams Pool Theatre through December 3. Despite being an entirely Spanish-language production, Alvarez, Bortolamedi, and cast members hope that “Jardín” will create an aesthetic that transcends the limits of language, requiring no translation.
For playwright Vargas, oppression under the 1970s Argentinean dictatorship served as the inspiration for “Jardín de Pulpos”; during this time, murdered students’ bodies were tossed into the sea and onto the beach, the beach where Vargas’ play is set.
“The very project of writing the play was originally very, very political,” Bortolamedi says. “And I feel like it still is very political.”
However, for director Bortolamedi, “Jardín” represents more that a political statement.
“There are more subtle ways of oppression that we can still learn to battle through imagination, through subverting the reality that we’re given…and venturing outside those structures that are potentially oppressive, through dreaming,” she says. “I think that’s very much the message of the play.”
The plot is based on the story of José, a man who loses his memory and identity on the shores where the bodies had once been flung, and his efforts to get them back with the help of the town’s people. According to Natali Alcala ’12, who plays La Anciana, “José regains his memory and his identity through dreaming.”
“The message of the play has a lot to do with the importance of recognizing your past so that you understand your current identity more and hence your future,” Alcalá says. “It very much, on a day-to-day basis, pertains to who we are and how we live.”
“As college students, that idea of having to rebuild your identity and really decide who you are is crucial to our present state,” says Adriana I. Colon ’12, who plays Antonia in the show. “I feel like that’s something that’s really relatable—that reevaluation of who we are and where we’re going.”
While it is true that “Jardín” is entirely written and performed in Spanish, according to Alvarez, Bortolamedi, and the cast members, this does not necessarily mean it cannot be a joy for all who come to watch.
“We try to aim it so that you don’t need to be a fluent Spanish [speaker],” Alvarez says. “You can still get so many different things out of it. And I think in the past, the audience has been very receptive to that. No matter what your background in Spanish is, I think that everyone can get something out of it.”
“There’s something that doesn’t need to be translated,” Bortolamedi says. “And that’s the aesthetic language that we use, which we think is really important.”
This aesthetic language is key to creating a “theatre under the sand,” which Bortolamedi identifies as a key goal of the production. This idea was coined by playwright Federico Lorca, the author of TEATRO’s last production “Baja La Arena, El Público.”
“We wanted to reinvent theatre,” Bortolamedi says. “The theatre under the sand is a theatre of fantasies, of dreams and desires. Not necessarily a realistic theatre, which is just a representation of something that is there, but a theatre that seeks to define what lies behind the facade that we see everyday.”
“The Adams Pool Theatre is amazing for the show,” Colon says, “because it has so much personality on its own. We try to exploit that and make it like you’re stepping into a different world when you step into that theatre.”
“This is part of a larger project of TEATRO,” she continues, “which is doing theatre in new, unconventional ways.”
The play’s focus on Latin American events marks a new phase in the history of TEATRO. “It’s the first Latin American play that we’ve done with TEATRO, and I think that’s a very important point,” Colon says.
“Before we were only doing Spanish playwrights,” Bortolamedi says. “So this is kind of a big step for us, showcasing what we think is the essence of Latin America as a region.”
With this exploration of Latin American history, universal linguistic experience, redefinition of theatre, and the nature of self-identity, “Jardín de Pulpos” hopes to provide a revelatory and memorable show, as is the goal of TEATRO as a whole. “We hope to bring a different point of view that’s not seen in many of the plays and arts at the Harvard campus,” Alvarez says. “By exploring other cultures and other languages, we expose different ideas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, a Swiss referendum called for a ban on the construction of minarets, religious structures used for prayer at mosques. The vote was supposed to “not [be] a rejection of the Muslim community, religion or culture,” according to proponents, but instead to make a statement against some of the more distasteful practices of Islamic fundamentalist groups, such as genital mutilation. But this egregious and discriminatory measure is not an effective censure of objectionable behaviors. It is an unacceptable solution that discriminates against the 400,000 Muslims who currently reside in Switzerland and flies in the face of the nation’s long history of respect for religious freedom.
A ban on the construction of minarets won’t stop harmful practices like genital cutting—the connection between the two is tenuous to say the least. The use of minarets is not even limited to fundamentalist Islamic groups. Therefore, the results of the referendum serve no purpose other than needlessly alienating and insulting the Muslim community.
Furthermore, the consequences of this textbook example of the tyranny of the majority can be a boon to the cause of radical Islamic groups, who can look for new potential recruits amongst an increasingly alienated Swiss Muslim population. By voting in line with the rhetoric of fear, the Swiss people bypassed minority rights in favor of a perverse and ineffective solution to a problem that only exists in one niche portion of the Muslim community.
The advertisements that accompanied this crusade against religious freedom play on this fear, and reveal how thoroughly it has stifled reason. One picture depicts seven imposing black minarets pinning the Swiss flag to the ground, with a Muslim woman clad in full Muslim garb at the forefront. Besides the fact that the minarets depicted are the wrong color and that there are only four existing minarets in Switzerland, the picture does not just represent radical Islamic practices as a threat to Switzerland, but rather Islam itself as a threat to Switzerland.
The intentions of the people who put together the ultimately successful campaign are misguided at best and openly bigoted at worst. Legitimate justifications for banning a harmless religious structure are frustratingly hard to pin down. But one thing is clear—the Swiss government and the Swiss people must take very immediate steps to right this wrong.

This Thanksgiving weekend, an entirely different meal dominated holiday conversation across the nation. President Barack Obama’s first state dinner, held on Nov. 24, proved eventful not because of its guest list of notable dignitaries and celebrities, but due to the presence of uninvited attendees Michaele and Tareq Salahi. These “gatecrashers” managed to infiltrate the private event allegedly in hopes of securing a place in reality television. Their actions reveal our culture’s peculiar and unfortunate fixation with celebrity status and Americans’ desire to achieve it by whatever means necessary.
Michaele Salahi, who is currently striving to become one of Bravo’s “Real Housewives of D.C.,” likely pulled the stunt in order to garner media attention and increase her chance of being chosen for the television show. It seems like this pair of Virginia socialites with a (deservedly) unflattering reputation wanted to attract the spotlight without doing anything to truly merit it. Their tactics—including posting photos of the event on Facebook—reveal as much.
In the past, one gained national recognition for a reason—due to an accomplishment, contribution, or ability. Now, however, celebrity has become an end in and of itself—reality television creates cultural icons who are famous for nothing other than their own celebrity. Consequently, people seek prominence to gain more prominence, pulling stunts they think could land them a reality-television-show role. This obsession with fame for fame’s sake reflects a strange trend in American culture. While we recognize that the desire for prominence is nothing new, the new media machine that creates stars out of individuals with nothing noteworthy about them creates new temptations to take whatever means necessary to make this desire a reality.
Ultimately, the Salahis’ intentions—while disturbing—proved harmless, and it is fortunate that their silly antics exposed security flaws without threatening the president’s safety. In essence, the gatecrashers prevented anyone with more sinister plans from taking advantage of loopholes. Now, the White House can address the issues with no real harm done. That being said, this incident need not lead to an overreaction within the Secret Service. While the president’s safety is of the utmost importance, we hope that he remains accessible to the American people. The Salahis’ strange claim to fame should not prevent Obama from shaking hands with citizens across the country. It just tells us something interesting about what fame means in modern America.

In 1872, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: “Only as an aesthetic product can the world be justified.” one hundred and thirty seven years later, much of society seems to agree. Entire industries and lives revolve around this belief. Every self-conscious teenager recoils at the idea yet spends an undue amount of time looking in the mirror. Aesthetics affect us whether we like it or not, for people expend great energy seeking their own ideal of how things should look. But how much do our own aesthetic ideals lead to an irrational satisfaction or disappointment in our academic lives?
In the collegiate sphere, there do seem to be idealized forms for professors. Lecture is heavily visual: Students sit and observe, as an audience. Otherwise, we could all listen to recordings in our rooms. Practically speaking, a professor’s image can enhance—or erode—the individual academic experience. Stereotypes of intellectuals range from the mad scientist to the bearded philosopher. In “A Beautiful Mind,” John Nash is the absent-minded eccentric, focused on game theory rather than his wrinkled clothes. And who but the venerable, bespectacled Dumbledore could have watched over Hogwarts? Many ideal forms of the academic exist, but each comes with with its own set of expectations and implications.
Indeed, many professors—aware of the ways in which first impressions can enhance, destroy, or create an image—use this concept to great advantage. Any student seduced by a shopping period class will know the effect of pristine lectures or exciting demonstrations. In 1950, an MIT study confirmed that prior information given about a guest lecturer colored how students perceived him. Those told that he had negative attributes graded him harshly post-lecture; others told that he had positive attributes perceived him more kindly after the very same class. Apparently, good aesthetics can enhance one’s reputation regardless of what one is “really” like. Unfortunately, if professors project an attractive but false image at first, students face disappointment as the “true” professor emerges.
However judgmental they may be, students’ impressions are inevitable. The theatrical setup of lecture invites students to observe rather than interact with their teachers. Professors become objects of analysis, to be examined aesthetically from behind a laptop in the back row. This distance can keep students from going to office hours, even when professors beg them to. For many students don’t know—or want to know—what their teachers are like outside of lecture. Faculty dinners and other interactive events allow students a wonderful way to break down ossified images—but even then faculty members are still often in business attire. In our minds, professors stand eternally at the podium in coat and tie, a perpetual ideal: How strange would it be to see a professor in pajamas?
Because we’ve always had to live with our own ideals in mind, consciously or not, we’ve learned to deal with the disappointment of realistic forms. We’ve become hardened to it. Clearly, a student won’t drop a class because the professor’s beard isn’t long enough. Yet I can’t ignore that twinge of satisfaction I feel when a professor’s style or mannerisms slide right into place in my mind. Maybe someday, “aesthetics” can even be another category in the Q Guide.

The sudden drop in Harvard’s endowment has brought our community to a crossroads. For many years, top administrators at Harvard have encouraged—or acquiesced to—policies that give greater weight to the bottom line than to the university’s historic mission, deferring to hired money managers rather than to its own experienced community. The endowment’s $8 billion loss is a stark warning of the peril that Harvard faces as it speeds down the corporate highway.
It is time to reassess where we are going.
While it is appropriate for Harvard to hire portfolio experts to manage its funds, it is not appropriate for them to gamble with the educational mission and future of Harvard. Over the past decade, these experts have climbed out of the back seat and begun to steer Harvard’s economic course.
Shallow corporatist principles—devoid of any purpose except accumulation at all costs—have guided Harvard’s investments and continue to direct its handling of the endowment meltdown. Critical economic decisions are made under a shroud of secrecy; high administrators give vague answers to urgent educational questions; powerless directors are told to freeze hiring and salaries; hard-working, lower-wage staff who make Harvard function are laid off in the worst recession in 40 years by an institution that proudly touts its courses in ethics, religion, and morality.
Yet this is only the beginning. At many schools, double-digit budget cuts are now being rolled out—but more are yet to come. Top administrators show little inclination to reverse course, or even to entertain questions as to how we got here.
Continuing down this road will be a calamity for Harvard for several reasons.
First, while it’s true that high-risk investments have increased the endowment exponentially, the story doesn’t end there. Many people strongly urge slow, low risk growth for educational institutions. Careful growth discourages $35 million salaries for investment-portfolio jockeys, helps restore balance between the liberal arts and the sciences, and minimizes steep budget fluctuations (leading to better departmental planning and reducing cuts). Most importantly, it controls the viral hunger for ever-larger returns on capital—a hunger that subverts the university’s critical search for a “veritas” that cannot be found in the marketplace.
Second, any manager knows that large budget cuts make it more difficult for a department to operate more “efficiently.” Cuts may “only” mean fewer support staff and janitors today, but they will definitely mean fewer faculty, courses, programs, and facilities tomorrow. It must be asked how this will affect our success as an educational institution. (Is this really the best we can do? Some of the greatest minds are assembled under one roof here, yet such measures as reducing shuttle bus runs, ending hot breakfasts, shutting down random elevators, cleaning less often, and laying off staff are still somehow considered innovative.)
Third, assuming that the past will be prologue, these cuts won’t be applied equally. This raises the question of who will have the loudest voice in advising top administration officials on where to slash. If our recent history is a guide, ex–Wall Street cowboys will have the ear of top administrators, while Harvard’s many stakeholders—the students, faculty, and other staff—will pay the price.
Local 615 believes the educational mission, as embodied by trustees, deans, faculty, students, staff, and alumni—not by the Harvard Management Corporation—should drive educational and economic policies at Harvard. In our view, Harvard needs to engage in genuine innovation and a sober reappraisal of its educational, investment, and budget policies. This can only happen when Harvard takes into account the ideas and needs of the broad community of stakeholders who care about—and who have an interest in—the future of this university.
Our union—comprised of a thousand custodial and security personnel across campus—has begun a listening tour with professors, secretaries, managers, deans, janitors, students, alumni, security guards, researchers, donors, and representatives from the Cambridge community. Engaging in broad-based, frank discussions of where our university is headed means embarking on an unfamiliar, uphill road for each of us, one that demands trust, overcoming old divisions and stereotypes, and realizing that, as partners, we can alter Harvard’s course. This, then, is the crossroads at which Harvard finds itself.
We can continue where we’re headed or change direction. Only open debate and inclusiveness leads away from the business-determined road we’re on and toward the university whose highest goals are to educate its students and nourish its community.
We must not allow it to be the road not taken.
Wayne M. Langley is the director of the higher education division of the Service Employees International Union, Local 615.

Harvardians have their privilege and hate it too—or at least many of them try. They relish the benefits that their degrees bestow: the education, the prestige, the McJobs. But they chafe at the idea that they’re elites, that they’re “better” than everyone else. They know that they’re privileged, for their success is only partly earned.
“Nonsense,” say critics. Harvardians fancy themselves meritocrats. They act like they paid for their just deserts in cash. “For today’s Harvard students, who have passed test after exam and interview upon interview, there is nothing accidental or random about their position in society. They belong exactly where they are,” Ross G. Douthat ’02 wrote in his book “Privilege.”
Their modesty, critics warn, is a mere social convention. “[T]o be treated well in this world,” David Brooks wrote in his book “Bobos in Paradise,” “you have to perform a series of feints to show how little your worldly success means to you.” Although students downplay their accomplishments, they still mention them. They consider their privilege entirely deserved.
I’m unconvinced. Students know that their admission hung on the whims of William R. Fitzsimmons ’67’s staff. Was the fact that you were the “Most Ridiculous Item of the Day” on Bill O’Reilly’s television show really more impressive than your friend’s ability to name all 435 congressmen? Please. Part of every student’s success was luck, and some of them feel guilty about it. Unfortunately, to soothe this guilt, they choose some rather regrettable outlets.
Harvard FML, a spin-off of FMyLife.com, is the latest example. Through their posts, students tell the world that their lives are worse than people think. “School has me so exhausted and stressed that I almost cried watching Chronicles of Narnia 2,” one poster lamented. “I expected to catch up on my reading and papers over break. I didn’t even catch up on food and sleep,” another desponded. Most posts decry the lack of romance on campus: “I asked my crush to dance with me at Heaven and Hell. She blew me off for a yellow telletubby.” A theme emerges: The privileged life sucks.
Outsiders may deem bachelorhood a pittance for prestige, so students try another route. They ridicule their pedigree. The most infamous example is the tradition of peeing on the statue of John Harvard. Students target the figure, whose shoe tourists rub for good luck, because it symbolizes their success. Three years ago, a writer for this newspaper explained the reasoning: “Urinating on the monument to higher education in America is a bizarre attempt at self-affirmation. It says: ‘Not only do I go to Harvard, but I spit, nay, pee, on it as well.’”
Still, to quote the showtune, it’s a privilege to pee. This tradition does not conquer entitlement; it takes it for granted. It does not make students humble; it makes them obnoxious. So students resort to one final method when coping with their privilege: They ignore it. In his book, Brooks captured the exemplary exchange: “If asked where you went to school, you will reply ‘Harvard?’ with a little upward lilt at the end of your pronunciation, as if to imply, ‘Have you ever heard of it?’”
Before you write that letter to the editor: Yes, many students come here for the academics and care less about the prestige. Yes, many perform community service and use their advantages for the common good. But when we disrespect this institution, we disrespect ourselves. Revelry in other people’s misery, public urination, and embarrassment over your affiliation are undignified. Yes, students are just trying to have a good time, but, believe me, there’s a difference between self-deprecating humor and “FML.”
My friends to the right of me—they do exist—get misty-eyed when they remember the old aristocracy. If a person’s rank depended on birth, they tell me, we wouldn’t have this culture today. People would know that their privilege was due to chance and would feel the need to justify their position through dignified behavior.
I’m not boarding that sinking ship. The old aristocracy is dead, and it was more arrogant than its aficionados admit. Still, students could use a sense of noblesse oblige. It’s a loaded term, but I had to keep your attention from your Toasty O’s. We should appreciate the fact that our education is a privilege and that the responsibility that accompanies it begins once you move into the Yard—not after you walk out of Johnston Gate. We can bear the pressures with more grace, look harder for the nearest bathroom, and remember that the f-word is a condiment, not a staple.
The only way to handle privilege is to live up to it. And that requires dignity.
FML.

Having a specific career in mind during college is not necessarily the key to future professional success, Ellen Alemany, Citizens Financial Group’s chief executive told undergraduates last night at a talk hosted by the Harvard-Radcliffe Women’s Leadership Project.
Instead of preparing for a specific career, Alemany urged undergraduates to develop a passion, regardless of how it relates to a particular field of employment.
“Excel at something,” Alemany said. “Show you have passion, whether it is for a sport, or a club, or a course. Employers respect that.”
Alemany encouraged students to search for unusual professions that allow them to continue to pursue their passions in the workplace.
An English Literature major in college, Alemany said she originally planned to go into law and took a job in the legal department at IBM after graduation.
Unsatisfied with her experience, she then accepted an offer from Chase Manhattan Bank. Alemany said the increased face-to-face interaction and exposure to tremendous amounts of global travel her banking job offered convinced her to build her financial career.
Finance allowed her to utilize many of the same skills she had developed while studying English, Alemany said.
“Finance is a lot like English,” Alemany said. “All my analysis skills were at work, and making good decisions and understanding management required me to use the skills I learned as an English major.”
Alemany’s personal story alleviated concerns for attendee Hideko Tachibana ’13.
“I’ve been very stressed about my classes and career choice,” Tachibana said. “But the way she talked about how banking wasn’t her first option relaxed me.”
Alemany also shared her experience working in a male-dominated industry.
“I tried not to think about my sex as a major factor in my career,” she said. “I hope that your generation doesn’t ever have to worry about what women should or shouldn’t do in the workplace.”
Co-directors of the Women’s Leadership Project speaker series Samantha R. Rosekrans ’11 and Alexandra M. Zindman ’11 said they hope Alemany’s example would inspire Harvard women entering the business world.
The organization is planning to bring in at least two more speakers this spring.

Former Mass. Governor Michael S. Dukakis emphasized the importance of grassroots campaign strategies to the future of the Democratic Party during a talk yesterday evening at Harvard Law School.
“I’m here to tell you that if you hope to someday be elected to office, a grassroots approach to campaigning is not just the way that you win elections, but the way that you engage people actively in the politics of your state and country,” said Dukakis, who graduated from the Law School in 1960.
Dukakis, who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1988, told the audience that the lack of constituent involvement in current political campaigns will inevitably lead to future Democratic losses.
He said that political consultants are currently too focused on fundraising rather than motivating their grassroots resources.
Dukakis spoke about the use of grassroots campaign techniques during his own campaigns, including visiting every household in Brookline, Mass., during his bid for state legislature in 1962.
Dukakis said he implemented the same technique of directly targeting voters while running for governor by appointing captains in every precinct to personally contact community members in his gubernatorial pursuits.
While Dukakis’s campaigns took place in the years before the advent of new media, he encouraged current politicians to take advantage of the resources provided by new technology.
“There are some things that have made things easier since I was in office, including the internet,” he said. “You won’t get elected over the internet, but it is still an incredible organizing and fundraising tool.”
Many audience members acknowledged that personal interaction between prospective political leaders and constituents will be an important strategy in the upcoming 2010 congressional elections.
“I think that grassroots campaigning is important, and I’m glad that he spoke about it because it’s something that most people don’t talk about with the emphasis on the use of the media in political campaigning,” said John W. He ’13.

Student event organizers grappling with Harvard’s convoluted room reservation process may find their task a bit easier with the debut of the Undergraduate Council’s online room reservation tool.
The Student Life Committee posted a spreadsheet on the UC’s Web site on Sunday containing detailed information about all available space on campus, including room capacity, media capabilities, and contacts for reserving each room.
“We wanted to provide one spot online where students can see what rooms can be reserved on campus,” said committee chair Senan Ebrahim ’12.
Aggregating relevant information is the first step in the UC’s plan to reform the process of room reservations, which Black Students Association President Spencer H. Hardwick ’11, an inactive Crimson news editor, called “complicated” and “bureaucratic.”
“Almost every room has a different way to reserve it,” said Hardwick, who worked with the committee last semester to develop ideas to improve the system.
The committee has also partnered with Computer Science 50 instructor David J. Malan ’99 to integrate the room information into Malan’s maps.cs50.net interface, an interactive map of Harvard’s campus.
“He’s been a great resource,” committee member Allen Yang ’11 said of Malan, who is also working with the committee to develop an improved online student events calendar.
Yang, who worked on the room reservations initiative this semester, said that the next step is to create an online database for all available rooms. Students would be able to search by their desired parameters and view all available rooms that fit the criteria.
The UC plans to hire a student programmer to develop this feature with an estimated launch date of Feb. 2010, Ebrahim said.
The ultimate goal for the room reservations project is a centralized and integrated system that allows students to not only search for but also reserve their desired rooms, according to Ebrahim.
But this feature may not be available for over a year.
“At this time, there are too many logistical problems with decentralized building ownership,” Ebrahim said, as buildings across campus are under the jurisdiction of different bodies within the University.
Ebrahim said that the integrated reservation system the committee envisions has been received favorably by the Office of Student Life and may be launched concurrently with the office’s new House space management system in approximately a year and a half.
Hardwick said he was heartened by the UC’s efforts thus far to improve the room reservation process.
“Just the fact that things are being consolidated [into] a comprehensive form is very refreshing,” Hardwick said. “[The information] will definitely go a long way in helping make things easier for student organizations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alex Voorhoeve, who has written on equality and responsibility and the theory of rational choice, advocated dialogue form over “monologic” writing as a means of grappling with tough ethical questions in a panel discussion held last night at the Barker Center.
Speaking to an audience with a background in the humanities and social sciences, Voorhoeve, a former fellow at the University’s Center for Ethics, focused primarily on issues raised in his new book, “Conversations on Ethics.”
Voorhoeve, a senior philosophy lecturer at the London School of Economics, argued that addressing philosophical questions with traditional written monologue is inadequate primarily because there is “no back-and-forth.”
The philosopher’s ability to respond to misinterpretations and unforeseen objections is hampered, and the reader becomes “indolent and passive” in a way that “thwarts learning,” he said.
But Voorhoeve acknowledged the natural advantages of writing—namely the opportunity to craft a well-formed argument in advance—and argued that the hybrid of written dialogue is most effective, citing his interviews with notable philosophers in his book.
Turning to the audience, Voorhoeve asked his book’s three central questions—whether moral intuition could be trusted, if moral judgements were objective, and why an individual should be moral.
Two other panelists, Harvard Kennedy School professor Frances Kamm and philosophy professor Thomas Scanlon—both interviewed by Voorhoeve for his book—expanded on the methodology of seeking ethical answers.
The book’s photographer, Steve Pyke, also shared a slideshow of his black and white, close-up photographs taken of philosophers in natural light.
Rod Kessler ’71, an audience member and an English professor at Salem State College said that he enjoyed learning about philosophy from an outsider’s perspective.
“I saw how their language stops being abstract and becomes very narrative,” he said, pointing to the use of hypothetical stories to prove a point.

With just a week left in the race for the Democratic nomination for the Mass. Senate seat vacated by the late Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, former IOP Fellow Alan A. Khazei ’83 said he is confident about his chances, despite tying for last place in a Rasmussen poll conducted in late November.
Khazei, a prominent social entrepreneur, was the top choice among just 14 percent of likely voters, tying with Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen G. Pagliuca, who is a 1982 graduate of the Harvard Business School.
While Khazei’s numbers represented a sharp uptick from a survey in late October, in which only 4 percent of likely voters said they supported him, Khazei still lagged far behind frontrunner State Attorney General Martha Coakley and U.S. Congressman Michael E. Capuano. Coakley was the top choice for 36 percent of voters, while Capuano received the support of 21 percent.
Khazei, a former Currier House Committee chairman, said that despite the numbers, he felt he was in a strong position going into next week’s primary.
“People love to focus on these polls, but they’re never right. The polls are just name recognition,” Khazei said in an interview Sunday.
He said that with a large number of voters undecided, he could still capture the nomination with a strong performance in this week’s debates.
“I’m extremely confident. I’m ahead of where I thought I’d be right now as a grassroots candidate,” Khazei said.
A number of undergraduate Khazei supporters expressed similar optimism about his chances in the Dec. 8 primary.
“We are going to win. There is no doubt in my mind,” said Sam B. Novey ’11, who serves as the Social Media Organizer for the campaign.
Novey cited not only Khazei’s poll bounce but also his recent endorsements from the Boston Globe and from Army General Wesley K. Clark as proof that the campaign has the necessary momentum to win the nomination.
Student supporter Elizabeth J. Newton ’11 echoed Novey’s sentiments, saying that while she plans to participate in phonebanking and canvassing over the next week, she is also expecting “lots of celebration on election day.”
But David C. King, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the chance that Khazei can overcome Coakley’s lead is extremely slim.
“Alan Khazei has decent field operations, but they’re among young people and don’t penetrate far outside the Boston area,” King said.
He added that a Khazei victory would require “a miracle of Biblical proportions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coup in Honduras that occurred over the summer and the subsequent international reaction may have large implications for the future of democracy in Latin America, Professor Steven R. Levitsky said at a dinner discussion last night.
The discussion was hosted by International Relations on Campus, the outreach arm of the Harvard International Relations Council.
International media first focused on the small Central American nation in June when the Honduran military ousted then-President Manuel Zelaya while he was attempting to reform the national constitution—over the objection of the Supreme Court—to allow him to serve another term in office.
The crisis intensified when the United States, following the lead of some Latin American countries and the Organization of American States, refused to recognize the new government. Leaders of these countries sought to restore Zelaya to power, even though the Honduran Congress and Supreme Court had sanctioned the ouster.
Levitsky said he largely agreed with the U.S. and Latin American policy, emphasizing that there have been few coups in Latin American in the past 30 years and that recognition of the coup threatened to destabilize other Latin American democracies.
“When a president is taken out of his house in his pajamas and is forced to leave by the military, that is a coup,” Levitsky said.
Strong democratic institutions, such as a congress that responds to the people and civilian control of the military provided the best hope of a warding off the cycle of instability and coups that have dominated Latin American in the past, he said.
“Democratic institutions have to weather storms and last over a number of years to take root,” Levistky said, adding that sanctioning the coup posed “an incredibly dangerous precedent.”
Some students—including Meredith C. Baker ’13, who was volunteering in Honduras at the time of the coup—disagreed with Levitsky about the decision to oppose the coup.
“The consensus of the Hondurans was that they did not like Zelaya, and that murder and drug trafficking rates increased under his presidency,” Baker said. “They did not want him restored to power.”

CORRECTIONS AND CLARIFICATION APPENDED
Only a day after graduating from Harvard College, Kiran K. Deol ’06, a first-time filmmaker, boarded a plane to begin working on a documentary charting the life of a female guerrilla fighter in Nepal.
The film is now one of eight documentaries on the shortlist for an Oscar nomination.
“Woman Rebel,” which Deol said is one of the few independently produced film on the shortlist, follows Silu, a former political prisoner who escaped from prison to join up with the People’s Liberation Army, a communist group founded in 1996 during Nepal’s civil war.
The American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will narrow down the candidate documentaries to three to five final nominations in February.
After learning that 40 percent of Nepal’s guerilla fighters were women, Deol—then an English concentrator in Mather House—decided to write a novella about a young girl fighting in the civil war for her thesis requirement.
“After writing a thesis about it, I was kind of compelled to make the documentary,” Deol said.
Deol said that some women move up within the guerrilla army ranks, allowing them to lead rebel efforts.
She added that she wanted to create a documentary that “showcased women as agents of change as opposed to victims of circumstance.”
Deol said that she hopes the documentary, which took roughly three years to complete, will increase awareness about Nepal’s political turmoil.
“I do believe in media as a form of social change and as a way to raise awareness through telling an engaging and informative story,” Deol said.
More than 12,000 civilians died during the decade of guerilla fighting instigated by the Maoist party in the 1990s, and Leonard W.J. van der Kuijp, a Tibetan and Himalayan studies professor who previously lived in Nepal, said the country continues to struggle with “abject poverty and incredible state corruption on every level.”
CORRECTIONS
The original headline of the Dec. 1 news article "Deol’s Film On Oscar Shortlist" incorrectly spelled the last name of the filmmaker. Her last name is Deol not Doel.
An earlier version of the article also gave the wrong year for the founding of the People's Liberation Army. The group was launched in 1996, not 2001.
In addition, the article misquoted Deol as saying that her film was the only film produced independently that was on the short list for an Oscar and as saying that women frequently rise through the ranks of the guerrilla army in Nepal. In fact, she said that women only sometimes are able to move up through the army’s ranks.
CLARIFICATION
The article also may have initially implied that Silu first joined the People’s Liberation Army only after escapaing from prison. In fact, Silu was a member while in prison and joined up with the group after escaping, according to Deol.

Harvard Law School Professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75 ranked seventh in Foreign Policy magazine’s first annual “Top 100 Global Thinkers” list published yesterday for his work on libertarian paternalism and his influence in the Obama administration, the magazine’s editors said.
Sunstein, who is on leave to head the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, shared the ranking with economist Richard H. Thaler of the University of Chicago’s business school. The two co-authored “Nudge,” a book arguing how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives in 2008. Sunstein served as an assistant professor and full professor at the University of Chicago before coming to the Harvard Law School last fall.
Foreign Policy’s managing editor Blake Hounshell cited Sunstein’s influence on Obama’s thinking as a major reason for his selection as one of the top global thinkers.
“We were looking for people who had a real impact in 2009,” Hounshell said. “Cass Sunstein is a really intriguing, behind-the-scenes guy who comes up all the time.”
Hounshell added that the magazine’s editors were particularly impressed with Sunstein’s work on libertarian paternalism, a theory that examines how the government can encourage people to make the decision they would take if they were better informed.
“It really seems to fit the moment—it’s neither left nor right,” Hounshell said.
News of Sunstein’s ranking did not surprise his colleagues at Harvard Law School.
“Of the legal thinkers of his generation, Cass has outstripped everyone else,” Law School professor Richard H. Fallon said. “He’s an incredibly far-reaching and creative thinker who’s now in a position to put some of his ideas into practice.”
Fallon also stressed the range of Sunstein’s work, which he said spans political philosophy, cognition, economics, and traditional history analysis.
Sunstein declined to comment for this article.
Other Harvard affiliates topped Foreign Policy’s list. Chairman of the Federal Reserve Benjamin S. Bernanke ’75 led off the list, followed by HLS graduate President Barack Obama at number two.
Samantha Power, Sunstein’s wife and another Harvard professor on leave in Washington, also made the list at number 80.

A team of Harvard bioengineers and biologists say that they have developed a cancer vaccine that eradicates melanoma tumors in mice and slows their reoccurrence.
The method detailed in the study, published last week in the journal Science Translational Medicine, used a miniscule plastic disk implant carrying the vaccine to recognize and eliminate tumor cells.
The new vaccine specifically attacks cancerous cells, avoiding the collateral damage on healthy cells that other cancer treatments often cause. This approach may also build long-term resistance within the immune system, the researchers said.
“[Traditional cancer treatments] are very invasive and destructive to other cells in the body,” said Omar A. Ali, a researcher at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and one of the co-authors of the study. “They do not adequately treat or cure cancer and don’t do anything to stop reoccurrences.”
Ali said that the new vaccine protects against the recurrence of melanoma, though the data supporting this claim remains unpublished.
“When we inject cancerous cells, memory of the immune system is sustained,” Ali said. “Tumors grow at slower rate and some mice don’t develop tumors at all.”
Using bioengineering techniques to target existing cancer cells in the body is not only easier but also less expensive than with more traditional methods, according to SEAS bioengineering professor David J. Mooney, who is also a co-author of the study.
“From a practical point of view, there is no need to manipulate and modify cells outside the body,” Mooney said.
Though this cancer vaccine is limited to use in mice, researchers at InCytu, Inc.—the company that owns the license for the rights of the vaccine—are looking to extend research to test the vaccine on other types of cancer and expand to human clinical trials.
The company is currently in discussion with the Food and Drug Administration and hopes to start human clinical trials in a year, said Dwaine F. Emerich, InCytu’s chief scientific officer and another co-author of the study.
Though the vaccine is still under development, the researchers say they are hopeful that the technique has broader clinical applications.
“This may directly lead to a cancer therapy, but it also leads to a blueprint on a molecular and cellular scale of what is needed in a immune response to generate the regression of tumors,” Mooney said.
But the authors stressed that more research is necessary before the vaccine can be used in humans.
“We don’t want to give this type of impression that this farther along than it is,” said Glenn Dranoff, one of the study’s co-authors and a Harvard Medical School professor. “It needs to be underscored that this is a mouse model.”

Frederick H. Joseph ’59, who was known for heading several prominent Wall Street companies over his long career, passed away on Friday at age 72.
Although Joseph was involved in a widely-publicized Wall Street scandal in the late 1980s, he is remembered by many of his classmates at Harvard Business School—where he graduated in 1963—for his leadership in business and nonprofit work.
Joseph served as CEO of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from 1985 until the firm’s collapse in 1990. Before scandal struck, Drexel profited in the 1980s from selling junk bonds, but then Michael R. Milken, a trader under Joseph’s supervision, was imprisoned for 22 months and fined $600 million for violating U.S. securities law, according to Bloomberg News. While Joseph faced no criminal charges, he was banned for a time from assuming another position as a Wall Street CEO, according to Portfolio.com’s “Worst American CEOs of All Time” list, on which Joseph ranked seventh.
“He was the captain of the ship, and in navy terms, if you’re the captain and the ship has trouble, the captain takes responsibility—he always took responsibility,” said Charles D. Ellis, a classmate of Joseph at HBS who worked with him at Drexel. “I’m a very tough person on integrity. I have known Fred quite well and stayed with him all the way through.”
Joseph rebounded from the scandal, becoming managing director of Morgan Joseph & Co., a firm which he helped to found in 2001.
“Fred was one of the real leaders in Wall Street,” said Joseph’s HBS classmate Gerald P. Kaminsky. “He built a firm which ultimately went down, but...he was a guy who was totally honorable, admired by his peers, and in recent years he continued to show his capability in building a business in the financial services area.”
Classmates noted Joseph’s activism in helping to found Partners of ’63, a nonprofit organization of members of the HBS Class of 1963 which assists educational causes.
“I have truly been impressed with him and his willingness to give back,” said classmate Ralph T. Linsalata, commenting on Joseph’s nonprofit work and his career in general. “In the financial services world he’s had a significant impact. He always seemed to end up as the driving force.”
Joseph also served as a director of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, which raises money for research on multiple myeloma, a rare blood cancer that he struggled with. Louise M. Perkins, chief scientific officer of the MMRF, remembered Joseph as “an incredibly gentle and patient man.”
“He was bright, engaging, fun, and a person I’m glad I got to know at Harvard,” said Kaminsky. “He’ll be missed by all of us.”

The latest round of financial readjustments hit Harvard Law School yesterday when Law School Dean Martha Minow announced a mix of cuts and expansions to programs that assist students interested in pursuing public interest careers.
In an e-mail to the student body, Minow announced the suspension of the Public Service Initiative, a program launched in 2008 that waives third-year tuition for students if they commit to five years of public service after graduation. The school also plans to decrease the amount of per-student funding for summer public interest work but will further expand loan repayment assistance for graduates.
In her e-mail, Minow wrote that all current students will be able to participate in the Public Service Initiative. However, it is unlikely that the program will be offered to future incoming classes, including students admitted this fall, Minow wrote.
Despite Minow’s announcement, Alexa Shabecoff, the Law School’s assistant dean for public service, said yesterday that the school is committed to having a program that incentivizes public service work. A committee has been formed to review the Public Service Initiative and will suggest a successor to the program in March of next year.
When the program was launched last fall, administrators were unsure how much student interest to expect. Yet, last year, over 110 first-year students indicated their interest in the program—50 percent more than the targeted number—according to then-Law School Dean Elena Kagan.
“It’s a new type of program, so we didn’t know how many people would want to take advantage of it,” said Kenneth H. Lafler, director of Student Financial Services at the Law
School, in an interview last fall. “We know how many have done it in the past, but quite honestly it was pure speculation on our part how many would enter this program.”
This year, 58 third-year students signed up for the initiative, which has a budget of $3 million per year for a five-year period ending in 2012, according to Lafler. About 50 to 60 students entered public service after graduation in previous years before the start of the tuition waiver.
In the past, administrators have expressed hope that the Public Service Initiative would encourage students to pursue their interest in government or non-profit jobs by relieving the financial pressure that might otherwise drive them to take lucrative corporate positions.
While the Law School is suspending the Public Service Initiative, it plans to expand the Low Income Protection Plan, a loan repayment assistance program currently offered to graduates working in paid positions. The plan will now be extended to graduates who have taken unpaid public service positions before they begin working at a firm.
Minow also announced that the school will allocate an additional $2.7 million to cover financial aid costs, despite Harvard’s 27 percent endowment investment loss during the 2008 fiscal year, which resulted in a $2.5 million drop in financial aid funding from the endowment going to the Law School.
Changes in the legal job market have pushed more students towards pursuing public service positions, and the Law School’s Summer Public Interest Funding for students who wish to engage in such work during the summer has been stretched to meet the demand. In the summer of 2008, about 375 students received funding, whereas last summer 495 received funds. Administrators expect over 600 students to request funding next year.
As a result, the Law School will reduce the length for which it funds student summer public interest work, guaranteeing eight instead of ten weeks of pay for students who choose to work in public interest law during the summer months.
The new program allocates fewer resources to each student but ensures that all interested students will have access to public interest funding, Shabecoff said.
In the weeks leading up this announcement, dire rumours had circulated among Law School students that cuts to the school’s public interest programs were forthcoming.
“I’m relieved because the worst of the rumours did not come to fruition,” said Brian T. Aune, the president of the Law School’s student government.
The announced changes come on the heels of the University’s first ever Public Service Week last month, during which University President Drew G. Faust urged the Harvard community to redouble its efforts to engage in public service, even while cautioning that the University would have difficulty committing additional funds to service-related initiatives given the current financial constraints.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With minutes left in the third period on Wednesday night, Harvard women’s hockey and its Dartmouth opponent were deadlocked at two and overtime seemed imminent. That is, until junior forward Liza Ryabkina got involved.
In her first game since dislocating her knee in September, Ryabkina pounced on a rebound from freshman Josephine Pucci’s shot and forced it over the goal line, earning a victory for the Crimson. Ryabkina, coming off the bench, also had an assist in the game.
“When everyone jumped on me after I scored that goal, I don’t think I’ve ever been happier in my life,” she said.
After spending the whole summer in Cambridge working out and preparing for the season, Ryabkina suffered an awkward fall while taking some shots during an unofficial captain’s practice. That fall, which her coach Katey Stone described as a “freak accident,” kept Ryabkina out of action for eight weeks and rehabilitating her knee while teammates were practicing maneuvers.
“She’s always been a big contributor on the team and is definitely an offensive threat on the ice,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “When she got injured at the beginning of the season, it was tough for us, especially on such a small team.”
Ryabkina did her best to stay involved during her recovery.
“It was really hard, but I came to all the meetings, I came to all the video sessions, I communicated with my teammates about what was going on,” she said.
Her dedication meant that the coaching staff felt comfortable putting her into the game against Dartmouth, only two weeks after she was first able to lace up skates again.
“She’s certainly learned a lot from watching,” Stone said. “Fortunately, when you have an injury you can make the most of it by learning and seeing things in a different way.”
Despite all the preparation, Ryabkina didn’t get doctor’s clearance to play until the night before the game. The short notice—and long layoff—meant nerves were inevitable.
“I was a bit nervous, just because I haven’t played a game since last year,” she said. “I did get caught in situations where I shouldn’t have been, but my teammates were always there to cover for me because they knew I wasn’t 100 percent.”
100 percent or not, Ryabkina came out strong against Dartmouth.
“She was really excited to come out and play on Wednesday, and that showed on the ice,” Farni said. “She played awesome, and she has the points to show for it.”
Ryabkina’s first game back was a tough one. Harvard didn’t get its first shot on goal until 15 minutes in, and the Big Green matched the Crimson goal for goal in the early stages, leaving the score tied at one at the end of the first period and 2-2 at the end of the second.
“Dartmouth’s always a strong opponent,” Stone said. “We’ve had some tremendous games with them.”
“I guess we came out a little slower than we had hoped to,” Farni admitted. “But we figured out what the problem was and fixed it.”
The change was evident in the third period, when the Crimson outshot its opponents, 18-4.
In the end, it was Ryabkina who made the difference, slotting home the winner and improving the Crimson’s record to 6-3-1 (6-3 ECAC). Her third-period heroics were a repeat of last season’s first matchup with Dartmouth, when Ryabkina scored the late-game winner in a contest that also ended 3-2.
Though she’s no stranger to making game-winning shots, after nearly two months on the sidelines, Ryabkina has a renewed appreciation for her team.
“The biggest thing that I realize after being injured is how much the sport and the team matters and how little time you have to play your sport,” she said. “I think the main thing that we’re going to tackle this year is to have fun. If we have fun, work hard, and play together, we’re going to have a pretty good season.”

Currently on an eight game winless streak, Harvard (1-6-2, 1-5-2 ECAC) will need more than optimism to win tonight against Brown (1-7-1, 1-4-1 ECAC). The Crimson fell to a new low in its most recent match-up on Sunday when Harvard was outshot and outmatched by at Dartmouth team that was winless in the conference.
Looking to turn its luck around, the Crimson will have extra motivation to defeat the Bears. Although Harvard and Brown tied both their regular season matches last year, the Bears have had a recent history of comebacks against the Crimson. Last March, Brown went into ECAC playoffs with a 13-game losing streak, but managed to shut out fifth-seeded Harvard, 1-0 and 2-0.
“We don’t want to compare things to last year, obviously,” junior goaltender Kyle Richter said. “Right now we’re focusing on what we do as a team, working together.”
The Crimson lost a scrimmage to Brown in the preseason, and the Bears will come into tonight’s game with the momentum of having just won its first game under new head coach Brendan Whittet against Connecticut on Saturday.
“We saw them in a scrimmage, and it’s very early on to call, but they do play a fast and physical game, and we have to combat that,” senior forward Doug Rogers said. “Our five-man effort in the D zone has to be better, and we have to make better decisions with the puck. We should be successful against Brown.”
Between the pipes, Richter looks to anchor Harvard’s defensive efforts. The former ECAC goaltender of the year, who boasted a .935 save percentage in league games his sophomore season, posted a career-high 43 saves in the team’s recent game against BU. Even so, the netminder sees a need for the Crimson to improve its defense.
“We just have to stick to our systems, in our defensive zone and our neutral zone,” he said. “We have to stay focused on that.”
On the offensive side of things, Harvard will look to some of its freshman to put the puck past Brown goaltender Dan Rosen.
Freshman forward Louis Leblanc, tied with sophomore forward Alex Killorn for the team’s scoring lead with nine points, will need to shoulder some of the scoring load. Leblanc is the top scoring freshman in the ECAC this year and tied for fourth among all NCAA freshmen with 1.12 points per game.
“All the freshmen have stepped up and done a good job,” Rogers said. “We have a lot of freshmen, that means they’re a big part of our team. They’re eager to learn and eager to play.”
Another rookie who figures to be a dangerous offensive threat to the Bears will be freshman forward Conor Morrison. In last week’s close loss to defending national champion Boston University, Morrison scored four goals for the Crimson. He was the first to score four goals in a game since Chris Bala ’01 in 1998.
“I think we have lot of new guys who are playing really well, putting up some numbers so far this year,” Richter said. “Morrison obviously had a huge game against BU with four goals.”
Although the Crimson hoped to harness the momentum of its close game last week against BU, it lost Sunday’s match-up against Dartmouth. Having defeated the Big Green, 6-2, earlier in the season, Harvard was suprised on Sunday night by Dartmouth, which outshot the Crimson, 41-29, en route to winning the contest, 6-2. Despite the team’s eight-game drought, the objective remains the same, both for tonight against Brown and for the rest of the season.
“Our goal is to win a national championship,” Leblanc said. “We have the power and the team to do that. It’s just a matter of getting everyone on the same page and working towards the same thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone needs a little bit of encouragement to get things done or, in the case of junior cross country runner Dan Chenoweth, to get things started.
“My older brother used to run, but I was pretty convinced I was going to be a soccer player,” Chenoweth said. “Every time I saw his friends they’d be like, ‘What are you doing next year?’ I’d say that I was playing soccer, and they’d just hit me. So eventually I gave in.”
The three-year member of Harvard’s cross country and track and field teams has come a long way since being bullied into the sport in eighth grade. In his career so far, Chenoweth has racked up four All-Ivy and two All-Regional honors along with several other individual championships and awards.
But don’t expect him to bring up any of his achievements on his own.
“Dan’s humble and not one to boast about his accomplishments,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “He’s very, very modest—he probably won’t even like the fact that there’s an article about him.”
The attention is well-deserved, especially coming off Chenoweth’s season-ending performance at the NCAA Championships last week. Despite just barely missing USTFCCA All-American honors by 2.2 seconds, he was the first Ivy League runner to complete the course and finished 42nd out of 250 competitors for the second year in a row.
“I wasn’t particularly happy,” Chenoweth said of the outcome. “I’ve had better days, but, hey, at least I know I can’t get worse than last year.”
The ability for up days and down days to affect a runner’s performance is something that Chenoweth says makes the sport distinct.
“With cross country there are just so many things that have to come together,” he pointed out. “You don’t know how your training’s going to turn out, you don’t know if you’re going to get sick, and, who knows, maybe you’re going to trip and fall. “
Chenoweth encountered and overcame one of those unexpected setbacks this season during the Heptagonal Championships in early November.
“Overall he had an outstanding season,” Saretsky said. “But the Ivy League championship was a truly fantastic performance, especially considering he wasn’t feeling 100 percent.”
Chenoweth won the meet’s 8k race in a time of 25:09.0 to become Harvard’s first individual champion in well over a decade and boost the men’s team to a sixth-place finish.
The unique opportunity for both individual and collective success is another part of what the standout runner appreciates about his sport.
“It’s not the same as a lot of sports like football or soccer where you’re playing positions that support each other,” Chenoweth explained. “We can score as individuals, and we can score as a team. You can work on those two goals together because doing the best thing for yourself is also the best thing for the team.”
This team mentality is also something Chenoweth stresses as an important part of the Crimson cross country community. With five of his seven blockmates on the team, it’s clear there is a strong bond between them.
“A big part of it is that from the first moment you come to Harvard, the first people you meet are people from the team,” he said. “I’d been for the first 10 days of my Harvard experience exclusively with the cross country team, stuck in the woods of New Hampshire with nothing to do, so you get to know people pretty well.”
Saretsky also pointed out Chenoweth’s contributions to the team’s improvement and success as a whole.
“He works incredibly hard and sets a fantastic example for the other guys on the team,” Saretsky said. “He’s done an increasingly better job of speaking up when necessary, advocating for his other teammates, letting them know what needs to get done to develop as a program.”
Chenoweth has set the bar high for his teammates and himself and is already looking forward to his senior-year season.
“I definitely just want to do better,” he said in reference to his performance on the national stage. “And I think I’m capable of doing a lot better.”
Looks like Chenoweth won’t be needing any more of that middle-school encouragement.

As the decade draws to a close, it's important to take a few minutes to reflect on your personal growth and achievement the last ten years—and, more importantly, to remember 2009 as the year of rampant celebrity deaths, balloons both real and imagined, and the sudden quarantine of all your friends.
To this end, the Crimson Arts Board proudly presents to you its annual Best of the Year Poll. For a glorious, fleeting moment, it will make you forget all the papers you're supposed to be writing. Then you can get back to watching this on repeat.
The poll closes Wednesday at 4pm, so do act promptly. Write-ins are heartily encouraged; our favorite answers will appear on the cover of Friday's Arts section.

When civil disobedience first came to Harvard in the 1960s, hordes of students took over University Hall, but last night’s “sleep out” for climate change just outside the doors of that very building was, well, not quite so dramatic.
At 9:00, three students pitched their tent and waited for HUPD to arrive. And waited. And waited.
The night was part of the Leadership Campaign, a statewide initiative organized by Students for a Just and Stable Future to push for 100% clean electricity in the next ten years.  Members have participated in sleep-outs every Sunday in the Boston Common and have organized two earlier sleep-outs in the Yard.According to John E. Beatty ’11, the group could not get permits to sleep in the Yard, and HUPD has broken up the first two sleep-outs.
But the protestors haven’t really gotten the true civil disobedience experience.
“The cops give us the ‘hippie eyes,’ but they’re generally nice,” Jono M.L. Rosenthal ’13 said.
Although they have forced the students to pack up and move inside, “Then they’re like ‘stay warm,’  and ‘see you next week,’” Eva N. Roben ’13 said.
If the students get arrested or are called to court for these citations, there could be academic repercussions – including probation or a forced withdrawal for one semester.
“While I’d like to think that being arrested for climate change wouldn’t carry as serious a penalty, you never know with the Ad Board,” Beatty said, “It’s like Russian roulette.”
Finally, the HUPD cruiser pulled up at midnight.
As they were threatened with arrest if they refused to leave, the students decided to peacefully pack up their tent.
“Polite but firm as always,” Beatty commented.
“They allowed us to flagrantly break the administrations rules for three hours before forcing us back into dorms powered by dirty energy,” Beatty said. “But we’ll be back tomorrow night, and so will they.”
The group will be camping out in the Yard every night this week as part of the final push before international negotiations begin in Copenhagen on Monday.

Hoping to get vaccinated against swine flu? UHS just announced that they've recently received a new shipment of H1N1 vaccines.
Alas, slower-than-expected production means that the shipment is small, and thus you need to be part of one of the groups which the Massachusetts Department of Public Health thinks should receive priority for vaccinations to get one. Pregnant? Under 18? Have a kid that's younger than 6 months old or a chronic medical condition? Work in healthcare or emergency services? Unless you fit at least one of these categories, you're out of luck for now.
On the bright side, UHS says it is equipped to begin vaccinations for everyone as soon as they get enough of the vaccine, even if it happens over J-term. That, of course, depends on whether they will ever get enough, and UHS admits that they probably won't receive all 15,000 doses that they requested.
