After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The flight from Boston to Toronto will only take an hour or so, but for three of Harvard men’s basketball’s players, the trip will hold extra significance.
Junior Danilo Djuricic, sophomore Noah Kirkwood, and first-year Luka Sakota all hail from the Canadian province of Ontario, and Saturday’s James Naismith Classic contest against Buffalo will mark a return home for the trio. For Djuricic and Sakota specifically, Saturday’s game at Toronto’s Scotiabank Arena, home of the NBA’s Raptors, will hold even more meaning.
While a four-hour drive is necessitated to reach Kirkwood’s hometown of Ottawa, Djuricic and Sakota both grew up within an hour from downtown Toronto and are expecting large crowds of friends and family in attendance for their homecomings. The two call Brampton and Etobicoke home, respectively.
“Coming to a school in the States, I never expected to go back and be able to play in front of my family and friends,” Djuricic said. “It’s going to be a great experience and hopefully we play hard, show out, get a good W.”
But for Djuricic and Sakota, their relationship runs far deeper than merely sharing nearby Toronto as home.
THE SERBIAN-CANADIAN CONNECTION
In many ways, Luka and “Nilo” came to Harvard on nearly parallel paths. Both grew up as part of the robust Serbian immigrant community of over 30,000 who currently reside in one of the world’s most multicultural cities. Sakota’s father Dragisa was a renowned professional volleyball player for OK Bosna in the Division I Yugoslavian League before coming to Toronto. Djuricic is also no stranger to the world of professional athletes — in fact, his uncle Mike played football at Boston College before becoming a journeyman CFL defensive lineman.
The fellow Serbian-Canadians, who quickly rose through the ranks of youth basketball in Toronto, first met about a decade ago. It was an encounter that the younger Sakota, only around eight but playing up for his age at that time, would like to forget.
“We ended up whooping his team, I don’t know how much,” Djuricic said.
“Seeing this dude [with] long hair, he can really play,” noted Sakota on his first impressions of his future teammate. “I was like, ‘Who is this guy?’. We just started to build a relationship from there.”
The two bonded on and off the court, as did their families. Bumping heads in the tight Toronto basketball circuit throughout their teenage years, Djuricic and Sakota were also deeply entangled in the Canadian national youth team system. The former captained the U16 and U17 teams, playing with current New York Knick R.J. Barrett before later winning gold with the U19s in the 2017 World Cup. The latter also competed on the U16s and U17s where he teamed up with a future member of the Crimson and coach Tommy Amaker’s first commitment to the Class of 2024, Josh Hemmings.
“It was a great experience playing against some of the best people around the world for your age group,” said Sakota of competing in Argentina at the U-17 World Cup. “Just learning so much from other players as well, different playing styles, and just representing your country, there's really no better feeling than that.”
In preparing for those tournaments, the two gained invaluable training time together and strengthened their games under the same roof.
“We were always involved with each other in some way, working out in the summer as well at the National Training Center with Canada Basketball,” Djuricic said. “So I was always in touch with him.”
THE HARVARD CONNECTION
It was right around the conclusion of the 2018 U-17 Tournament — in which Canada finished fourth — when assistant coach Brian Eskildsen began talking with Sakota. Already selected onto the gold-standard BioSteel All-Canadian team, Sakota noted that his longtime friend “helped push [Harvard] up a little bit and helped me commit.”
“[Luka] always thought that me being at Harvard was a huge deal,” Djuricic added. “He wanted to emulate that with his own thing in terms of getting the best education and playing high level basketball as well. So I think the recruiting part was easy.”
Fast forward a year later, and the two are already each contributing important minutes to the Crimson as it seeks to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2015. Djuricic continues to serve as a versatile forward who can stretch the floor and attack inside, making a name for himself with his proclivity for put-back dunks. Sakota can similarly play multiple positions and has shown success both from deep and at the rim.
Outside of the court, the Canadian connection remains strong for the duo and Ottawa native Noah Kirkwood. Luka noted that he still plays with a “chip on his shoulder” from his AAU days competing against American teams who always discounted the team’s talent, while Danilo commented on how the shared “outsider” status created a valuable chain of mentorship that has helped the three adjust to life in the States.
As the team embarks on this special leg of the non-conference season to play Buffalo in ‘The Six’, there will be no lack of jokes or references to Toronto slang amongst the squad. But this will certainly be an even more special homecoming for the two who grew up in the shadows of Scotiabank Arena and will now take the court together as teammates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2018-2019, the Harvard men’s hockey team entered the campaign’s third week still looking for an elusive first victory. After suffering the longest winless start to a season in eight decades, the squad finally notched the win column when it visited Brown.
This year, the No. 13/12 Crimson (4-0-0, 4-0-0 ECAC) likewise tripped to Providence, R.I. for a week-three battle with the Bears (2-3-0, 2-3-0), but with a different goal in mind: extend a season-opening winning streak to four games. Harvard did just that, skating to a 4-1 triumph on Friday night, and now holds a 4-0-0 record for the first time since 1993-1994’s Frozen Four season.
As with any ambitious program, though, a promising opening slate has not fostered any complacency among Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 and his group.
“I didn’t think we played very well in the first period,” the bench boss said. “Even though we came out of the period with a 1-0 lead…too often in the game we were just getting beat to loose pucks. And I give [Brown] credit. They looked like they were hungry.”
With one minute remaining in the second period, the Crimson powerplay cashed in on the eventual game-winner. Junior blue-liner Reilly Walsh ripped a one-timer home from his usual man-up office courtesy of a cross-ice feed from freshman winger Nick Abruzzese.
The goal, Walsh’s first of the year, should serve to ignite the offensive defenseman, who is off to a modest start production-wise — only by his standards, as he is coming off a near-point-per-game sophomore campaign (12–19—31).
Abruzzese’s primary assist on the play was the first of his two helpers on Friday, which give him sole possession of Harvard’s scoring lead through four contests. The Slate Hill, N.Y. native has made an immediate impact with the Crimson’s first forward line, picking up points in each game this season en route to a two-points-per-game pace (2–6—8). The dish to Walsh marks Abruzzese’s first powerplay assist as part of the team’s top unit.
“[Abruzzese is] super skilled, very competitive, and he’s one of these guys that passes the puck, it seems, almost always at the right time,” coach Donato said. “He’s equal parts playmaker and goal-scorer…. He’s very slippery on the powerplay. He’s got an element of speed, too.”
Thanks to the late-period strike, Harvard took a lead into the locker room after 40 minutes. A strong first five to open the final frame, featuring two even-strength goals, distanced the Crimson from the hosts and sealed victory.
Within 90 seconds of the third-period faceoff, sophomore R.J. Murphy continued his stretch of solid performances when he broke up a play in the neutral zone and called his own number on the ensuing three-on-one rush, finding twine on Bears net-minder Luke Kania (4 GA, .846 SV%). Murphy has pocketed three points (1–2—3) in his last two games and is plus-four in that span, filling out Harvard’s nominal second line alongside impact juniors Henry Bowlby and Jack Badini.
Just three minutes later, sophomore forward Casey Dornbach put the dagger in the Bears, firing a wrist shot from the left circle over Kania’s far-side pad. After a stellar freshman campaign (7–22—29) worthy of ECAC Rookie of the Year honors, Dornbach is firmly in the mix again this season to be among the group’s scoring leaders.
“In the third period, I thought we played much better and started to win some battles,” coach Donato said. “Our message in the second was, ‘Hey, we haven’t played great here, [but] we have a one-goal lead.’ It’s not often you get a chance to go out and have one real good period and win a game, and that’s kind of what we did.”
A major factor in the Crimson’s undefeated start to the 2019-2020 schedule resides in the crease. After senior Cameron Gornet (1-0-0, 3.00 GAA, .936 SV%) posted a solid outing in the team’s season-opener against Dartmouth, coach Donato opted to give freshman Mitchell Gibson (3-0-0, 1.00 GAA, .968 SV%) his first start of the season. A 31-save shutout win against Princeton earned Gibson the start the following night, when Harvard trounced a ranked Quinnipiac team.
With his first NCAA weekend — and an impressive one at that — under his belt, the first-year tender heard his name called again on Friday and recorded yet another sturdy performance (1 GA, .966 SV%).
The only blemish on Gibson’s sheet against Brown came in the second period, when junior forward Chris Berger broke through on the Bears’ second man advantage opportunity of the night.
“He’s calm in there, he’s square to the puck a lot,” said coach Donato after Gibson’s pair of starts last weekend. “We feel like we’re in a good spot. We have two guys we have faith in that are going to give us a solid effort…. Having faith in more than one goalie is usually a good sign for your team.”
Berger’s second of the year evened the tilt after Harvard’s ice-breaker, which came more than 20 minutes earlier in the opening frame. For the third straight game, Bowlby potted a puck on the rush. The junior received a stretch pass from freshman defenseman Ryan Siedem and showcased his speed as he streaked down the left side before finishing in-alone on his backhand. Siedem’s two-line apple marks the first point of his young collegiate career.
Through four games, the Crimson has received notable production from its top two forward lines, among other skaters. Both trios are anchored by reliable two-way centermen, with sophomore Jack Drury pivoting the first pairing and Badini manning the second.
A critical but oft-overlooked element of these centers’ contributions is their aptitude in the faceoff circle. Last season, Badini won 66.0 percent of his draws, good for second-best in Division I. Drury’s 58.2 percent clip was among the top 20 nationwide.
On Friday, Badini won 10 of his 14 draws, and Drury won 11 of 19. As a skilled Harvard team looks to continue its successful stretch to begin the season, puck possession will remain a key enabler of the group’s effective high-scoring style.
“[Faceoffs are] something, as my career has progressed, I’ve taken more pride in,” Badini said. “Playing triple-A hockey growing up, my teams liked to run a lot of faceoff plays, so if you can’t win the faceoff you can’t run the play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — For the third time this month, it all came down to the final play for Harvard. And for the third time this month, the Crimson failed to deliver. Unfortunately for Harvard, a game that began with a celebration of players in their final year came to an end with a failed last-minute drive in the final quarter. Harvard dropped this Saturday’s home contest to the Pennsylvania Quakers, 24-20.
“Once again, we played really hard,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Once again, at times, we played really well in all phases. But déjà vu. They just made one more play than we did.”
Both the Crimson (4-5, 2-4 Ivy) and the Quakers (5-4, 3-3) entered Harvard Stadium with a flat record; however, the momentum was on the side of the visitors. While Penn just narrowly cruised to victory over its last two opponents, the Crimson had suffered a pair of disheartening defeats over the course of its most recent two games. Against Dartmouth, a last-minute Hail Mary warded off the Harvard upset; at Columbia, an overtime interception clinched a Lions victory; and today, a one-handed Quaker snag landed Penn the game-winning touchdown.
“If you look at the Ivy League right now and you look at the scores today, there's so much parity in the league and there’s so many good players,” Murphy said. “You've got to play really well every single week, there’s very little margin for error. And you have to finish. Not the first time I've said that, you have to finish. We did a lot of things well today. We’ve just got to finish.”
The last few minutes of Saturday’s contest were a whirlwind for both teams. Down by three with seven minutes to go, the Quakers were just inside the Crimson redzone on fourth down. Having already missed two field goal attempts, the Penn offense elected to go for the conversion, a decision that most certainly paid off for a team whose kickers are an abysmal three-for-nine on field goal attempts this season. Quarterback Nick Robinson launched the ball just as the pocket collapsed around him, his pass seemingly a few inches too far for a Rory Starkey snag. However, the Quaker wide receiver extended his arm just far enough to secure the one-handed catch, tipping the ball into his own hands and the lead into Penn’s.
“At the line, it was a run-pass-option and at the line [Robinson] chose to go with the pass option,” Starkey said said. “Initially, when I saw the ball in the air, I didn’t think I was going to catch it. It was an extremely hard ball to catch, but I just stuck my hand out there and it stuck.”
The game was not yet over. Just over seven minutes remained in the fourth quarter and Harvard was set to receive the kick. Set to recover the four-point deficit, the ball was left in the hands of Crimson junior quarterback Jake Smith. The offense took its time in moving down the field, Smith gaining the first down on every other play. Upon crossing the fifty-yard line, Harvard freshman running back Aidan Borguet snagged a 26-yard pitch, finding a hole in the Quaker defense before being taken down by four defenders. That left the Crimson 10 yards from the endzone. A series of incomplete passes added up to a Harvard turnover on downs.
“We had some bang-bang plays that now are kind of the story of our life lately,” Murphy said. “Close but no cigar.
Over the next twenty seconds, the Crimson called all three of its timeouts, its defense pushing just hard enough to keep Penn from escaping chain gang territory. The Quakers were forced to punt with just over two minutes left, Harvard’s desire for a winning record once again left to Smith.
The Crimson quarterback tossed an eight-yard pass to receiver Cody Chrest to start the drive. Smith, however, would not get much closer to the endzone. A few short rushes forced a pair of reviews, but both times the referees responded in the negative. After a final run was stuffed for no gain, Harvard was forced to relinquish to Penn both the ball and the victory.
“What was a little strange about it was that the call by the official was that it was right there,” Murphy said. “Everybody agreed that it was clear that he made the first down. Penn didn't even challenge it because they thought it was a first down. And the replay official says no, for me looking here from space. Doesn't look like a first down. But I do digress.”
For the Crimson, this game was truly a back-and-forth affair. The Harvard offense entered the fourth quarter with their heads held high, thanks in no small part to the squad’s mid-game dominance.
On the defensive side, the Crimson’s territory was largely secured by defensive back Max Jones. A second-quarter incompletion forced by Jones on Penn receiver Mac Humble foreshadowed his next few plays, holding the Quakers to minimal yardage and keeping the team’s offense humble. After that pass drop, though Penn was a mere 17 yards from the endzone, Harvard’s defense prevented a number of Quaker pass attempts and held them to a field goal, the red zone truly becoming the Crimson zone.
On the next drive, the Crimson offense failed to match its defensive counterpart: for the third time in the contest, Harvard was ushered off the field after a four-play drive. Penn’s victory, however, was short-lived: a few minutes later, the stadium erupted in cheers and jeers as Jones seized a Robinson lob for the interception, his third straight game with a pick.
Smith then retook the field and, in a series of rapid-fire completions, led his offense on a trek through Quaker territory. A 28-yard field goal by Harvard senior Jake McIntyre was just enough to tie up the score, creating a detente that would not last for long.
Robinson’s subsequent crusade through Crimson country was not nearly as successful. Two penalties on Penn served as precursors to a Harvard punt block, the pigskin clobbering a Quaker on the helmet for the second time in the half. The Harvard special teams unit leads the country in blocked kicks, coming up big once again.
 Smith, however, a mere 25 yards away from his second endzone toss, was unable to bring it home for the Crimson. After a series of incompletions, McIntyre was summoned onto the field once again, propelling the ball through the goalposts from 42 yards, tying a career-long mark for Harvard’s all-time leader in field goals as the half came to an end.
“Coming out of halftime, I wanted to be first on the field,” Penn coach Ray Priore said said. “I wanted them to see us as they come out of the tunnel. I wanted our guys to look at them as they were coming out after. That was really important for us: to take that field, to play fast, and to finish.”
If the Quakers left the field disheartened after their second-half slip-up, they certainly returned reinvigorated. Within less than a minute, Robinson launched a 70-yard touchdown pass to Starkey, the teams trading the lead once again. However, that Starkey bang was followed by an offensive whisper — both Harvard and Penn were forced to punt on fourth-and-many over the next two drives.
That offensive inaction didn’t last for long. Repetition quickly turned to redemption for the Crimson as receiver Cody Chrest traded his E for an I, taking his spot as savior of the Harvard lead. Smith completions to three different Crimson receivers, along with a rush of his own, left Harvard eighteen yards away from retaking scoreboard dominance. That’s where Chrest came in: a breakaway rush was capped off by a clean juke and the Crimson touchdown.
Penn failed to find a savior of its own on the next drive; a series of short passes was not enough to carry the Quakers to the redzone. For the third time, Penn kicker Daniel Karrash was summoned onto the field to attempt a field goal, and for the second time, the three-point kick was no good. However, Karrash was not alone in his failure to find the goalposts. Though the Harvard offense was able to get within Penn’s 20-yard line on the next drive, a McIntyre field goal attempt was also wide, keeping the score 20-17 as the third quarter wound to a close.
 The game started with just as many slips of the Penn. Saturday afternoon may have began as senior-centric as Harvard’s veterans took to the field in celebration of their last home game, but it was the Crimson juniors that were employed in Harvard’s short first possession. After being forced to receive, running back BJ Watson brought the Crimson offense to the 20-yard line, setting up what would be a short first drive. A few short runs by Watson and roommate Devin Darrington were not enough to secure a Harvard first down, and the Adams House residents were replaced by the Crimson punting squad.
For Harvard, the next play would be indicative of the game as a whole: though a Jon Sot punt came down directly on the noggin of a Penn receiver, the Crimson was unable to take possession even after a midfield scramble. Instead, a Quaker recovery and scramble started the visitors a mere 40 yards from the endzone.
After Penn gained a quick first down, the Crimson defense began to show its true colors, putting pressure on Robinson for the first time of many. However, a snap toss by Robinson paved the way for a 35-yard pass-rush by Penn running back Karekin Brooks, bringing the offense to the red zone less than two minutes after taking the field. One play later, Robinson found a hole in the defensive line, running the pigskin to the endzone for the first touchdown of the contest.
“We had some big third down conversions,” Robinson said. “That's what builds momentum. Big plays like that motivate you to keep going. You build some momentum and I think we did that pretty well.”
Once again, the Quaker kickoff sent Harvard to the back of the field and, once again, the Crimson offense was forced off the green after a single drive. A fourth-down punt attempt by Harvard’s Sean McKeogh was foiled by Penn’s Hunter Hayes in a move more melodic than any of his namesake’s country ballads, pouncing on the punter as he dropped the snap.
However, eight yards away from doubling their score, the Quakers were unable to find the endzone or the goalposts, as a short field goal attempt by Karrash was no good.
 In a drive that started out mirroring the Crimson’s last two, the Harvard offense retook the field, struggling to reach first-and-10. However, a late-quarter snatch by Watson bookended his early-game reception, leading to a 47-yard catch-and-run for a Crimson touchdown.
The score tied and quarter nearly over, the Quaker offense stalled upon taking possession, punting after only a few playcalls. The Crimson matched with a four-play drive of its own, the Darrington-Watson duo unable to break a carry over five yards.
Over the course of the next minute, the two teams racked up a penalty apiece. The Quakers, having been pushed back five yards for delay of game, were forced to punt, however, a roughing-the-kicker call on tight end Adam Shepard led to a flurry of flags and resuscitated any chance Penn had of scoring on that possession.
It wasn’t until the fourth quarter that the Quaker defense began to stir. Penn’s defensive line pushed the Harvard offense down the field on the team’s first drive of the quarter, resulting in a loss of yardage and a punt by Sot.
Robinson took to the field at Harvard’s eighteen-yard line, a false start pushing his squad back even further. The quarterback, not to be outdone by the Penn defense, scrambled for a twelve-yard run on third-and-ten, lighting anew Quaker hopes of victory.
A series of plays for over twenty yards propelled Penn into enemy territory, the air battle becoming a fight on the ground as Brooks ran for four consecutive gains. As time would tell, the Quaker’s late-game offensive dominance would only continue, leading to a one-handed catch, a conversion, and a win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — In another chapter of a storied rivalry, the No. 13/12 Harvard men’s hockey team faced off against Yale to finish the young season’s first road trip. Thus far, the Crimson’s offensive power and quick-strike ability had made up for the squad’s occasional puck mishandling. Facing a struggling Bulldogs team, Harvard looked to collect another two conference points and add another notch to its undefeated play.
In the end, the Crimson’s performance was a microcosm of the season so far. The visiting team capitalized on its chances, and solid goaltending nullified its defensive errors, as Harvard (5-0-0, 5-0-0 ECAC) defeated Yale (1-5-0, 1-5-0) by a score of 6-1. Two goals from rookie forward John Farinacci and a stellar showing from senior net-minder Cameron Gornet (1 GA, .976 SV%) put the contest beyond reach for the hosts.
“[We’re] always excited to be able to come here and get two points,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought we just battled. It’s a tough place to play, obviously.”
Just 50 seconds into the game, Yale got a taste of the Crimson’s punishing offense. In the Bulldogs’ zone, Harvard junior forward Henry Bowlby found himself surrounded by opponents but managed to get the puck to sophomore linemate R.J. Murphy. Murphy made no mistake, putting the puck by senior net-minder Corbin Kaczperski to give the visitors the early lead. Murphy now has goals in three straight games, while Bowlby has netted points in each of the past four tilts.
The Crimson doubled its lead as the first period came to a close. Freshman defenseman Henry Thrun shot the puck from the left point, where Farinacci collected it at the side of the net and banked it in off Kaczperski.
“I really don’t know how that went in,” Farinacci said. “I saw [Thrun] shoot it from the point. I went behind the net and tried to wrap it around, and I think it might’ve hopped up the goalie’s pad and off his helmet and in…. But you’ve got to take [goals] how you can.”
The Bulldogs’ own pace brought plenty of chances, however. The hosts were the beneficiaries of a too many men penalty assessed against Harvard in the first, as well as three more minor penalty calls in the second. Gornet, who played backup to rookie Mitchell Gibson for the previous three games, was up to the task.
“I think every team, especially Yale, they’re going to want to try and get in my grill,” Gornet said. “Maybe they saw that I hadn’t played in three games, and so they thought maybe they could get into my head. But…at the end of the day I think I would prefer a game where I get a lot of shots.”
With Yale attempting a comeback from the outset of the contest, Gornet faced a barrage of shots but was able to turn them all aside — by the halfway mark, the Bulldogs had put up 20 shots already.
“I thought Cam was excellent tonight,” coach Donato said. “He looked calm, he looked confident. I think you could feel it on the bench, that the guys knew that he was locked in…. It’s a credit to him, after watching for a couple games, to come in and play that well.”
The Crimson opened the third with 1:30 remaining on a power play chance, having been outshot 28 to 15 to that point. The 16th shot was another dagger: unable to set up the man advantage effectively, Harvard carried in on an odd-man rush instead, and junior defenseman Reilly Walsh fired a shot past Kaczperski from the high slot. Just like that, the visitors were up 3-0, with most of the final period still remaining.
But the scoring was far from over. Both Farinacci and captain Nathan Krusko added tallies for the visitors, the latter with a shorthanded strike for his first goal of the season.
On the same penalty, however — a call that had coach Donato fuming on the bench — the Bulldogs finally broke Gornet’s shutout bid. A pretty passing play ended with senior forward Mitchell Smith punching the puck home; Gornet’s cross-crease lunge was to no avail.
Nevertheless, the Crimson rode out the last few minutes of the game, and added a goal courtesy of junior forward Jack Badini, to earn a weekend sweep. The triumph extends the current unbeaten streak to five games, which is the team's longest since its Frozen Four season in 2016-2017 — although there is lots of winning to be done before coach Donato's group even approaches that memorable 16-game stretch.
Despite the fact that Harvard outscored opponents 10-2 on this road trip, shot differential remains an area for improvement. By the final buzzer, the Crimson was outshot 42-28, a number that might not entirely be explained away by the team’s game-long lead. As long as Harvard has the kind of performances in net it has been seeing, though, it can afford for its team defense to be a work in progress.
“At the end of the day, my job is to stop pucks,” Gornet said. “If I’m going to have to stop 40 shots a night, then that’s what I’m going to have to do.”
