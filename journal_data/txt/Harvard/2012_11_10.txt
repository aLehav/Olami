After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season ended for Harvard men’s hockey with a 3-1 loss in the ECAC Championship Game in Atlantic City to Union. Friday night, the Crimson got another shot at its conference rivals, as No. 13/14 Harvard took on the No. 7/8 Dutchmen.
The much anticipated rematch did not turn out to be much of a contest, as Union defeated the Crimson, 6-2.
“I give Union a lot of credit,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They looked like they had an identity and attacked us.... We’re doing a lot of things to ourselves that are not giving us the opportunity to win games. Union doesn’t need any help; they’re a really good team.”
Harvard (3-2, 2-2 ECAC) went down early, with the Dutchmen (6-2-1, 3-1) netting two goals in the first three minutes of play.
The Crimson looked sluggish in the opening minutes of the first period. Union defender Charlie Vasaturo’s slapshot 41 seconds in slid between junior goaltender Raphael Girard’s legs to put the defending ECAC champion—and preseason favorite—up, 1-0. It was Vasaturo’s first career goal and the first shot of the contest.
Before Harvard could regroup, senior attacker Luke Greiner received a penalty for hooking, and the Dutchmen were on the power play. A Crimson penalty kill that had allowed just one goal on 12 chances so far this season held on for 1:52 of the two minute penalty kill. But with eight seconds left before Harvard brought a sixth man back on the ice, Union senior defenseman Greg Coburn received a pass across goal from sophomore Daniel Ciampini and tapped the puck into the back of the net.
The goalpost came off its line on the play, but after a review, the referees ruled it good, putting the home team behind, 2-0, with 57 minutes left to play.
The Crimson got one back less than two minutes into the second stanza. Coming out of the break invigorated, freshman Jimmy Vesey streaked down the ice, taking a pass from Greiner on the right side of the net. The highly touted rookie deked one defender, burst past another, and fired a wrist shot past Hobey Baker finalist and All-American Troy Grosenick to score the third goal of his young career.
Shortly after, Grosenick—who missed time last season with an ankle injury—went down on a broken play. Harvard sophomore Tommy O’Regan was pushed into Grosenick, upending the keeper and prompting a stoppage in play. Grosenick remained down on the ice for some time before skating off with support and being replaced by sophomore netminder Colin Stevens. Grosenick did not return to the ice.
“He’s one of the star players in our league,” Donato said of Grosenick. “I hope that he is able to bounce right back and that it’s not something that costs him any kind of time. It was kind of a freak scenario, but I don’t think anybody likes to see the best players in our league get hurt.”
With momentum looking on the Crimson’s side, the Dutchmen were quick to quell any thoughts of a comeback.
With 14 minutes left to play in the second period, junior attacker Matt Hatch fired a thunderous slapshot from the right. Girard was in position, but the puck bounced off his knee and into the net to put Union up, 3-1.
After maintaining pressure for the remainder of the period, the Dutchmen put themselves further in front. Ciampini found himself in front of goal again, but instead of passing the puck off, he took it upon himself to beat Girard to give Union a commanding 4-1 lead.
“At this point we just need to establish what we want to do,” Donato said. “That’s what is disappointing about [the result]. I don’t think we ever got into a team game. When you get behind right away, sometimes that happens. But that’s two games in a row now where we lacked an identity as a unit.”
The third period saw the Dutchmen continue to pour it on. With 9:28 remaining in the game, Girard gave up his 10th goal in the last two games—Harvard lost 5-1 to Yale last Saturday—leading to his being replaced by freshman Peter Traber. Traber did not fare much better, giving up a goal just over a minute later to make it 6-1.
“Even though it may look like [Girard] has given up a lot of goals, I would still say that he’s been one of the best players on the team these past few games,” Vesey said. “It’s been more about how we’ve played in front of him, the plays we’ve made and haven’t made.”
The remainder of the game was marked by sloppy play and flaring tempers, as the teams traded multiple shots on each other but fewer on goal to the tune of 11 penalties in the final frame alone.
The Crimson finished the scoring when sophomore defender Patrick McNally put the puck in the back of the net on the power play with 1:28 left.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—The Ivy League football championship is headed back to Philadelphia.
By successfully neutralizing Harvard's greatest strengths on Saturday, Penn did what it could not do in the de facto Ancient Eight title game a year ago and earned itself at least a share of the league championship with a 30-21 win at Franklin Field.
In many ways, the result of the contest was a tale of the two offensive lines.
Penn’s  blocking dominated a Harvard front four that came into the contest  leading the FCS in run defense and sacks per game. The Quakers rushed for 234 yards on the afternoon while the Crimson failed to record a sack for the first time all season.
Meanwhile, Harvard’s offensive line lost senior  starting center Jack Holuba to injury and left senior quarterback Colton Chapple  under heavy pressure all day. The swarming Penn pass rush hit its peak with three  consecutive sacks on the Crimson's final drive, including a game-clinching  safety.
Harvard (7-2, 4-2 Ivy) came into the contest as a heavy  favorite but now will need to beat Yale and hope Penn (5-4, 5-1) loses  next weekend at Cornell to earn a championship share of its own. With the victory, the Quakers became the first team with four losses to earn at least a share of the Ancient  Eight championship since Dartmouth in 1982.
"This  was a terrific team victory against a terrific program," Penn coach Al  Bagnoli said. "We have the greatest respect for Harvard....  When you can win against them, you know you've accomplished something."
The Quakers lost starting quarterback Billy Ragone to a  dislocated ankle and scored just nine points in the second half, but  that turned out to be enough, as their defense shut down the nation’s  fourth-highest-powered offense over the final two quarters. The  Crimson finished the game just 4 of 13 on third down, and Chapple threw  two interceptions for the first time this season.
"Penn was tremendously physical all day," senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk said. "All the credit has to go to them. We didn't execute."
Meanwhile, Ragone shredded the Crimson defense with his arm and legs,  throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for 96 yards and a score before  getting knocked out. Quakers halfback Lyle Marsh also had a big game, collecting a career-high 133 yards on 27 carries.
"We're not used to people running the ball  on us," Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. "That certainly had a huge impact  on the game—[Penn] being able to run the football and keep us  off-balance with the play-action pass."
The victory marked the  culmination of a significant turnaround for Penn, which started the season 2-4,  including a loss to league bottom-dweller Yale. But the Quakers have  run off an increasingly impressive series of wins over the past three  weeks, beating Brown, Princeton, and finally Harvard to reclaim a share  of the title it won in 2009 and 2010 but surrendered to the Crimson in a 37-20 loss at Harvard Stadium in the  season's penultimate week a year ago.
"We found our identity at  the right time," Bagnoli said. "We kind of lost our way, [but] ever  since then I think we've gotten closer to playing the way we are  structured to play."
Neither team scored in the third quarter, and the squads traded touchdowns in the fourth.
Just  57 seconds into the final period, Penn backup quarterback Andrew  Holland threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mitchell King, who  was able to wrestle a jump ball away from junior safety Chris Splinter  to put the Quakers up two scores—Harvard's largest deficit of the season.
"Andrew put it in a terrific  spot for [King], and he went up and got it," Bagnoli said. "It was a  pretty athletic play...and it gave us a bit of breathing room. We knew  that wasn't going to be the end of it, but certainly it was nice to have a  two-touchdown lead."
Harvard answered right back on its next  drive, as Chapple capped an eight-play, 64-yard series—highlighted by a 31-yard third-down completion to Cameron Brate—with a  one-yard touchdown pass to Juszczyk.
The  Crimson offense could go nowhere on its next two drives, but the defense  held its own against a conservative Quaker offense, which let Holland  throw just twice. On a third and three from the Crimson 44, senior  defensive end John Lyon stuffed the Penn QB to get Harvard ball back.
With 2:29 to go, the Crimson took over at its own 11-yard line needing a touchdown to tie. But Chapple was sacked on three consecutive plays,  the final one coming as Brandon Copeland brought down the quarterback in the end zone to seal the Penn victory.
"The D-Line had a great game today," Copeland said. "They pushed [Chapple] right into me. I just had to wrap my arms around him."
In the first half, the Crimson was plagued by a number of defensive miscues that led to multiple big plays for the Quakers.
Penn  got on the board just 2:45 into the game, when on  third and nine, Conner Scott got open behind two Crimson  defenders on a deep seam route for a 32-yard score.
But on the  Quakers’ next possession, junior safety Chris Splinter intercepted Ragone,  and Chapple then led a six-play, 49-yard drive that he capped with a  four-yard touchdown run off play-action to tie things up.
Penn  answered right back on its ensuing drive, largely thanks to a 47-yard  scamper by Marsh. Later in the series, the Quakers caught a break when a third and four Ragone pass was deflected and ended  up right in the hands of receiver Brian Mitchell at the Harvard two. Two  plays later, Ragone took it into the right corner of the end zone on a  bootleg to put Penn up, 14-7.
"Ragone had a tremendous game," Murphy said. "He [displayed] great leadership, showed who he is.... He had us off-balance."
Early in  the second quarter, Chapple led an eight-play, 72-yard drive in 3:48 to  tie the game again. In the series, the senior completed passes of 26 and 25 yards  to Juszczyk and wideout Andrew Fischer gained  15 yards on a reverse before senior running back Treavor Scales scored  his 12th touchdown of the year from a yard out.
But later in the  half, the Quakers regained the lead, with Ragone collecting 27 total rushing yards on consecutive plays. The  quarterback capped the 11-play, 84-yard drive by running play-action,  rolling left, and, under heavy pressure, hitting Ryan O’Malley for a  two-yard touchdown to put the Quakers up, 21-14, before the break.
"[Our kids have] been challenged all week and I'm not really sure how many people gave them a chance," Bagoni said. "They were pretty focused and pretty determined and they wanted to prove that they belonged on that field, and I think they did.... We were just not to be denied."

Seems like someone's not too happy with the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
Know who's responsible for the graffiti on the Lampoon? Let us know in the comment section below.
(N.B. In all seriousness, this wasn't us. We'd like to think Crimson editors are more creative than that.)
