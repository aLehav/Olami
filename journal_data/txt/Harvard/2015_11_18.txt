After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a bizarre claim at a campaign rally, arguing that there “would’ve been a much different situation” if the French people were armed. Before French officials were even able to finish counting their dead, Trump began pushing his political agenda.
Unfortunately, this was not the first time this year that Trump made a political argument about gun control in the aftermath of a terrorist attack in France. In January, he tweeted “Isn’t it interesting that the tragedy in Paris took place in one of the toughest gun control countries in the world?” after the attack against humor magazine Charlie Hebdo. Although French ambassador Gerard Araud mistook Trump’s old tweet for a comment on this attack and responded in a frequently circulated tweet that has since been deleted, the fact that there were any tweets from Trump to be confused about is disturbing. While these two events are different, Trump’s sentiment is not.
What Trump misses here is the fact that this is not about gun control. While preventing any tragedy is obviously important, gun control is about stopping criminals and the mentally ill from getting a gun in the first place. As tempting as it might be to think the opposite, loosening gun control certainly cannot prevent terror attacks. The attacks in Paris are what happens when trained soldiers from a terror state sets their sights on death and destruction.
As Paris has so tragically shown us, gun control cannot stop an act of terror. This tragedy is a perfect example of the unfortunate reality that no matter how diligently a country works to keep its citizens safe from senseless gun violence, a terrorist organization has the potential to make it all look insignificant in an instant. But if Trump wants to talk gun control, we must speak honestly. In France, the gun death rate per 100,000 people was 2.83 in 2012; in the United States, it was 10.69. One horrific ISIS attack does not undo years of successful gun control during which the death rate from guns was nearly four times lower in France than in the United States.
One attack does not mean that a theater full of disoriented and terrified concertgoers should be expected to wield pistols in order to defend themselves against terrorist soldiers armed with AK-47s and suicide belts. It is astounding that Trump could possibly think that a theater full of armed vigilantes would have been able to prevent such a coordinated attack. More guns are not the answer, but gun control should not even be the question.
Asking the French to become more violent versions of themselves is a victory for the terrorists seeking to create a more barbaric world. While we must not respond by arming Parisians, there is certainly a role for military intervention to fight ISIS. But on an individual basis, we must start not with guns, but with peace. The day after the shooting, an unknown pianist took his instrument to the Bataclan theater and played a chilling rendition of John Lennon’s pacifist anthem “Imagine.” How fitting that music was used as a defiant symbol of peace in front of a concert hall where terrorists attempted to destroy the spirit of a nation. We now have the opportunity to show just how badly they failed.
We must not allow the terrorists to win. When we are afraid to go to a concert hall out of fear of it becoming a war zone, the terrorists have won. Using such a horrific tragedy to score a political point about gun control thousands of miles away is not courageous. Only when good people begin to take back what ISIS has attempted to steal from us all with selfless expressions of love and peace do the terrorists truly lose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is no such thing as a slut.
In my past articles, I’ve argued the points that get me hot and bothered extensively. I’m still going to do that here, but I don’t want the very simple, unquestionable message of this piece to get lost, so let me just reiterate: there is absolutely, unquestionably, standing-on-a-rooftop-shouting-it-through-a-megaphone definitely no such thing as a slut. And it’s time we let “slut-shaming” fade from our society’s mind: There are no sluts to shame—there are only people.
And not just any people: females are primarily the victims of “You’re a slut,” “Ugh, what a whore,” and, “She’s such a skank.” This is because misogyny, patriarchy, and rape culture perpetuate and maintain the idea that certain women are bad because of their past and present sexual practices. Men are sometimes called sluts (particularly queer men, it’s worth noting), but our society does not endorse those labels alongside an environment of misandry and shame mongering. (For the purposes of this article I’m going to confine my discussion to cisgender individuals; the struggle of sexuality shaming for non-cis folks is a whole different ball game and deserves its own article.)
Now, let me be perhaps the first (although I really hope not) to tell you that you have been lied to: as a member of a patriarchal society that condemns female promiscuity for unfounded and often arbitrary reasons, you’ve been conditioned to think that a woman participating in frequent consensual sex is a shameful thing. This is not only false, it’s cruel, dangerous, illogical, and haughty. And it’s time we explore why it’s a thing.
Our biggest problem with sex is our insistence on moralizing it; we have to see it as either right or wrong instead of something that just is. But here’s the thing: moralization is only valid within a frame of consequences. For example, we moralize murder for consequential reasons: it takes a human’s life, devastates their loved ones, removes them from a world that may have benefited from their existence, etc. It’s easy and reasonable for us to rationalize murder as bad when we consider those consequences.
But the act of consensual sex itself, considered separately from any potential outcomes, should not be thought of in the same way, regardless of how frequently one has it. And before you go spitting all kinds of rebuffs against that, let’s just stop and address some of them:
“First of all, a woman’s virginity is special and should be preserved.” Let’s not do this. As a concept, virginity is as imaginary as being a slut. Go look at a woman’s pelvic ultrasound. There is nothing lost after having sex for the first time, no ball of purity in a woman’s fallopian tubes that a penis is able to suck out. Virginity is as much a tool used to control women’s sexuality as is the word slut.
“A woman who has a lot of sex doesn’t respect herself.” Hush. A woman who wants and gets lots of sex is not only likely a woman who respects herself, but also a woman who treats herself right. That said, unless you’re in her head, you really don’t get to decide either way.
“Well, a woman who has a lot of sex clearly doesn’t value herself beyond what her body has to offer.” Go ask said woman yourself. I think you’ll find that she values a multitude of things about herself besides just her body. And even if a woman considers her body to be her best quality, why does that warrant your condemnation? Everyone knows their strengths and weaknesses; if a woman considers physicality her greatest strength, so be it.
“A man having lots of sex is like a key that opens many locks, but a woman having lots of sex is like a lock that can be opened by many keys.” HO BOY. This is, without a doubt, the stupidest, most infuriating, most inaccurate analogy to ever fuel a legitimate social debate. Let’s set the record straight: locks are designed with the single function of keeping something under wraps. Keys are designed with the sole purpose of opening them. Humans, on the other hand, are multifaceted and multifunctional. Defining men and women in terms of keys and locks fuels the mentality that men are designed only to be after something that women are designed only to protect, and that when a woman decides to have sex, especially lots of sex, she is failing to do that “job.” That’s just utterly ludicrous.
Now, it’s important to note that there are specific outcomes of sex that should be considered critically. Some, for example, are even criminalized: refusing to disclose one’s HIV-positive status when having sex is legally considered a felony in many states because of the danger it presents to the person who may contract the virus. Promising to be faithful to one’s spouse and then having sex with another person is a betrayal of trust, hurtful toward the spouse, and generally moralized as being bad.
But some arguments around being a slut due to the consequences of one’s sexual practices are as invalid as they are unnecessary:
“A woman who has a lot of sex is an incubator for STDs.” 1) Not necessarily true. Any educated woman who makes informed decisions about contraception and regularly gets herself tested can have plenty of sex and not contract a sexually transmitted disease or infection. 2) This is hypothetically as true for men as it is for women, so your double standard is showing.
“A woman who has lots of sex is just asking to get pregnant.” Also not necessarily true. See above comments about informed contraceptive choices.
I could go on and on, but in the end, “slut” is an epithet based not on fact, but solely on skewed and hurtful judgment. My own epiphany that the concept of sluts was conditioned into me over time was akin to learning that the tooth fairy was actually just my parents somehow managing to slide $1 bills under my pillow while I slept: Once I knew about it, I was not only hot and bothered, but also felt like I should’ve realized it all along. I hope this article helps you reach that same realization. The idea of a slut has, from day one, been a daydream, and it’s about time we all wake up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first explosions, a little past 9 o’clock in Paris last Friday night, reminded us with shrapnel and screams and gunfire of our world’s reality: Our world is rent with bloodshed and populated by people divided by hatred. Each night, the news tells us about a world marked by a simmering intolerance so quotidian that it has taken this tragedy in Paris to awaken our attention.
Our hearts break for Paris. They break for 129 Parisians, for 43 Lebanese, and for 18 Iraqis. They break for the millions of Syrian refugees, and for those displaced in Ukraine or the Democratic Republic of the Congo or in countries the world over. These issues are systemic, they are real, and all too often we find ourselves turning a blind eye when they do not strike home.
Three devastating hours in Paris have raised the stakes, for the Western world and for the United States in particular. The nightclubs and bars and theaters of Paris are not so different from those of London or New York or Washington, D.C. When it comes to ISIS, we know now that their interest in wreaking death and destruction knows no geographical confines.
This attack has personalized the threat, but it has also focused our perspectives. The United States must rethink its strategy for fighting violent extremism and terrorism and reconsider the commitments that it is willing to make going forward. It is therefore essential that the next president, whoever that may be, has a firm understanding of foreign affairs and a unwavering belief that the US should be actively involved with the outside world. But we should also think broader: Though ISIS may be in the news today, it is hatred and intolerance that are our real foes. Inhumanity must be fought anywhere and everywhere we see it, from the arrondissements of Paris to the refugee camps of Syria. However, fighting extremism from 35,000 feet in the skies above Iraq and Syria is no substitute for fighting extremism in the hearts and minds of people.
Rejecting intolerance and winning hearts and minds starts with our own. It would be deeply misguided—for presidential candidates, Harvard students, or anyone else—to allow our thirst for justice develop into a desire for misdirected vengeance. We have seen how Paris has responded, with strangers tweeting the hashtag #PorteOuverte to open their homes to others stranded far away from theirs. They responded to the worst in our world with the best, courageously offering to invite strangers into their homes at a time when gunmen were still at large.
We must remember too that ISIS does not represent Islam. It is distressing to see violent attacks against Muslim communities, or accusations made against Muslims. The murderers and perpetrators of the attacks in Paris, Beirut, and Baghdad defame the name of the religion they purport to represent, and Muslims—in France, in the United States, and in nations around the world—show every day the characteristics of true faith: Love, tolerance, and acceptance. Their hearts break too. Here at Harvard, let us never forget that.
As a nation, we must show resolve overseas and tolerance at home. As college students, all we can do is love. We cannot order troops into battle, but we can desperately seek to avoid falling into the trap of Islamophobia. We should strive to do as Paris has done, even amidst the chaos of a bloody and interminably dark night—to respond with tolerance, with love, with friendship, and with open doors. Today and always, we should be proud to say:
Nous sommes tous Parisiens.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her new book, Physics professor Lisa Randall ’84 proposes a novel theory about the role dark matter played in the dinosaurs’ extinction and the relevance of abstract particles to everyday life. 
The book “Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs,” released Oct. 27, posits that a “pancake-shaped disk” of dark matter is responsible for causing a comet impact that wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. This theory is so distinct that it has garnered significant media attention from outlets such as Scientific American and the Guardian.
When our solar system came into contact with the disk—a phenomenon that occurs approximately every 25 to 35 million years, according to Randall—the gravitational force of the dark matter possibly dislodged one or more objects from the Oort cloud. The Oort cloud is a region at the margin of our solar system that is thought to contain billions of icy objects that could be at least 12 miles wide.
“If there is an additional kick on [the dark matter disk], then you can potentially dislodge something from the Oort cloud,” Randall said.
Dark matter, which is believed to account for most of the matter in the known universe, is undetectable by conventional means—though its gravitational interactions with nearby objects can help researchers identify it. Randall’s study proposes that this dark matter has more of an impact in the dense form of a disk, and that our solar system’s oscillating orbit around the center of the Milky Way prevents regular collisions with this disk.
Randall said she believes that one such collision caused a comet to be knocked from the Oort cloud and sent hurtling towards the Earth, wiping out the dinosaurs.
While the theory itself is newsworthy, Randall does not want readers of her book to focus only on its novelty, but also on how it demonstrates how rapidly scientific inquiry and knowledge can change.
“The book uses the theory—because it is a speculative theory—as a sort of excuse to explore what we do know about the cosmos,” Randall said.

Weeks after a consortium of more than 80 colleges and universities said it would release an application platform to rival the Common Application, admissions experts and Harvard officials are skeptical that the new portal will actually make higher education more accessible to under-resourced students, as the group claims.
The member colleges of the Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success—including Harvard—announced the alternative college planning platform in September. Students can build portfolio “lockers” of their essays, presentations, and other work in the portal and share them with advisers and admissions officers for feedback throughout high school, though they can create their lockers as early as they like.
According to the coalition’s website, the new platform is intended to “get low-income, underrepresented, and first-generation students thinking about college earlier” and “give them concrete tools for planning and applying.”
Yet Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said he still has concerns about the platform, which is currently scheduled to start accepting applications in the summer of 2016. 
Fitzsimmons said he has repeatedly opposed the coalition’s strict conditions for membership, which he said include a graduation rate above 70 percent within six years and a demonstrated commitment to financial aid.
According to Fitzsimmons, a major advantage of the Common Application is that it is available for all colleges to use, allowing students to apply to a variety of schools more easily.
“We hope the coalition application would recognize the stress that many high school students are under, and take the bureaucracy out of applying to colleges so students could focus on which college would be the right match,” Fitzsimmons said. He is leading a task force on the coalition’s membership criteria, he added, and will advocate for opening the application to all schools.
Jon Boeckenstedt, associate vice president of enrollment management and marketing at DePaul University, also questioned the coalition’s membership criteria and said the member schools, “by and large, do a pretty weak job of enrolling low-income students.” Boeckenstedt expressed doubt that creating another college application platform would actually simplify the application process for the low-income students the coalition aims to help.
“I just wish someone could tell me how fracturing the admissions process is going to be an advantage to low-income students,” he said.
Other admissions experts worry that the coalition application could worsen existing socioeconomic disparities in admissions by privileging students with more resources to spend curating their portfolios.
“Now, you’re giving the hypercompetitive parents and students essentially a four-year opportunity to present who they are,” said Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia. “The people who will have the time and energy to strategize about that typically are not going to be low-income kids.”
Fitzsimmons, for his part, agreed that the “locker” feature of the coalition application could lead to additional stress for both overburdened students and guidance counselors.
“I worry that you could create what I will term a ‘locker arms race’ that could begin as early as the ninth grade or earlier,” he said. “That could ramp up the stress and anxiety and pressure that many students feel and that many counselors feel.”
While the coalition initially intended to open the portal for prospective students in January 2016, its release date has since been pushed back to April after widespread negative feedback.
“I think one of the biggest problems with the launch was the extraordinarily high number of questions that have gone unanswered and scenarios that were not properly thought out,” Boeckenstedt said.
Anna Ivey, founder of the college admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting, acknowledged the criticisms of the new platform, but said she would reserve judgment until the coalition application was formally released.
“I can understand some of the pessimism, but at the same time, I think innovation in this area is a good thing,” she said. “It’s healthy for schools to consider alternatives. With innovation is always going to come some criticism as well.”
According to Fitzsimmons, the admissions department sought to develop a third alternative to the Common Application and the Universal College Application to give students more flexibility in the application process. However, he emphasized that Harvard is still “very happy” with both existing applications, and has no plans to abandon either.
“At the moment, we are part of the coalition, and consider it to be a work in progress,” Fitzsimmons said. “We’ll see where it goes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 30 Harvard affiliates who were in Paris during Friday’s terrorist attacks, including several undergraduates traveling and studying abroad, were confirmed safe by Saturday, according to Harvard’s office of Global Support Services.
The events of Friday night—which included suicide bombings, coordinated shooting attacks, and a hostage situation—killed at least 129 people and wounded upwards of 300 others, according to official reports. Members of the Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the attacks, which drew the world’s attention to Paris.
Several Harvard students were in the region during the time of the attacks, including James T.R. Loomos ’16, who said he stayed at a hostel about a mile away from the Bataclan music hall where 89 hostages were killed.
Loomos, who was in Paris for the weekend, said he was eating out around the time of the attacks and was not aware that they were happening until later that evening.
“Everything from there just started moving really fast,” Loomos said.
Claudia D. Oh ’17, who has been studying in Paris this semester, said she was traveling for the weekend in Brussels, Belgium when the attacks occurred and spent Friday night reaching out to her host family and friends who had stayed behind.
“Originally they had just said that there was a shooting that had occurred at a restaurant,” Oh said. “We didn’t realize how big the problem was until later in the night, when we realized hundreds of people were dead.”
Oh said she sensed a difference in the atmosphere when she arrived back in Paris.
“You could tell that everyone on the Metro was a little bit nervous,” Oh said. “Usually people on the Metro talk with their friends or read, but on Monday and [Tuesday] there was complete silence, and an aura of nervousness.”
Loomos was originally supposed to return to Cambridge on Sunday but moved his flight up by a day. He described the airport as a scene of chaos— with long lines, mobs, and major delays— and as the most stressful and “disheartening” traveling experience he has ever had.
“The reason I decided to leave early was because I was worried about not being able to get back to school on Monday,” Loomos said. He added that even though he arrived at the airport four hours before his flight, he would have missed his flight had the airline not held all their planes due to the situation.
Joseph D. Levy, Harvard’s director of global support services, said his office is responsible for providing Harvard affiliates abroad advice on how to cope in difficult situations like terrorist attacks and natural disasters. The office also maintains a University-wide travel database to account for affiliates abroad who register their trips.
In the case of the recent attacks, the Global Support Services staff made contact by email or phone with all of the affiliates in Paris who were enrolled in the travel registry, according to Stephen P. Taylor, the associate director for international safety and security. The staff also accounted for affiliates whose location was not in the registry or was reported incorrectly.
The Harvard affiliates in Paris were advised to seek shelter and avoid affected areas, Taylor said.
“We have the ability to be flexible and use our initiative,” Taylor said. “Fortunately we didn’t have anybody who needed immediate assistance, who was wounded—or worse.”
Loomos said the resident dean, house masters, and tutors of Winthrop House, where he lives, reached out to him after hearing about the attacks.
“That was reassuring for me, but also for my mom and my dad,” Loomos said. “It was cool that a school would look out for their students even when they are traveling abroad.”

With more than 1,000 likes since its launch on Friday, a new Facebook initiative called Female Athletes of Boston has garnered significant support among Harvard students. According to its administrators, the page aims to recognize female athletes at the collegiate level for their athletic performance.
Naomi K. Lang ’16, a rower for the Harvard women’s lightweight varsity crew team, said she decided to create the Facebook page after Googling “female athletes” and finding results that “sexualized” women in sports.
“All I could think of was all of the amazing female athletes I know, who will eventually go pro...and them being represented like that,” she said.
After a few days of brainstorming, Lang chose to create a Facebook page featuring female athletes at Harvard as well as other colleges in the Boston area, such as Tufts University.
“I’m going to post photos of women who are athletes in uniform, playing their sport. They’re not going to be off in makeup and heels,” she said.
The page centers on female Harvard athletes from a number of sports teams. Elizabeth C. M. Durack ’17, goalkeeper for the women’s soccer team and a friend of Lang, said the women in the page’s cover photo are portrayed the way she believes they should be, as “tough and fierce.” The cover photo features Durack and Lang as well as other female Harvard athletes from the basketball, track and field, field hockey, and softball teams.
“We as female athletes have noticed that women often get portrayed more for their looks or their personal lives rather than their performance on the field,” Durack said.
She added that she hopes the Facebook page will increase coverage of female athletes in general, citing research showing that “women make up 40 percent of athletes across the world and get 4 percent of media coverage.”
Lang echoed this sentiment, calling on media outlets to provide more coverage of female athletes.
“I think all of the organizations and journalism groups at Harvard can really help this by publicizing female sports,” she said. “It would be cool to do a ‘female athlete of the week.’”
At the same time, the Facebook page seeks to encourage all athletes, regardless of sex. Durack says that Female Athletes of Boston in no way aims to take away from the respect and recognition that male athletes receive. “We want all athletes to get the recognition they deserve,” Durack said.
Lang said she envisions the page expanding to other cities and campuses around the nation. “I want this to become a known website,” she said. “If someone from, say, Stanford reaches out to me and says, ‘We want to do one in California,’ I would be like, ‘Yes!’ ”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supreme Court Associate Justice Elena Kagan discussed what she described as “remarkable” changes in interpretation of statutory law in a conversation with law professor John F. Manning ’82 during an event at the Law School on Tuesday.
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow introduced Kagan, one of her predecessors as dean. She noted that this lecture series is named after Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin G. Scalia, whom Minow described as Kagan’s “sparring partner, hunting partner, and friend.”
The talk centered on what Minow called the “revolution” in statutory interpretation over the past several decades that has shifted the focus in the courts from common law to statutory law. Statutory law is written by legislatures, whereas common law is the collection of legal precedents set by court decisions.
“I’m not sure if somebody said to me ‘statutory interpretation’ I would even quite have known what that meant,” Kagan said, referring to her years as a student at the Law School. “It was not really taught as a discipline.”
Much has changed since that time, Manning noted, and now courts pay far more attention to the text and wording of statutory law than they ever did before. Kagan ascribed much of this change to her colleague, Scalia, whom Kagan said had “more to do with this than anybody.”
“Justice Scalia has taught everybody how to do statutory interpretation differently,” Kagan said. Following Scalia’s example, more legal thinkers consider the meaning, wording, and understanding of statutory texts, in a school of thought known as textualism.
Kagan said she believes that Scalia’s part in this change in the role of the judiciary will earn her colleague, with whom she has been known to have ideological disputes, a place in history.
“The fact of the matter is, you wake up in 100 years and most people are not going to know most of our names,” Kagan said, referring to herself and her colleagues on the Court. “I think that is really not the case with Justice Scalia, whom I think is going to go down as one of the most important, most historic figures on the Court.”
Audience members who packed into the auditorium in the Wasserstein Campus Center where the talk took place said they were struck by Kagan’s candor.
“It was amazing that she described herself as a textualist,” said visiting legal researcher Takahiko Iwasaki. “That was an amazing and candid thing to say.”
“I feel like she has a very down-to-earth way of portraying sometimes very cerebral issues,” said Daniel A. Parino, a student at the Law School. “It’s rare to see someone with that much influence and hear what they have to say.”

Speaking to a packed room of enthusiastic Harvard students and affiliates, including members of the Harvard baseball team, Baseball Hall of Famer and former Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez shared lessons from his career on Tuesday.
Professor of Government Michael Sandel facilitated the conversation, held in Sever Hall. It began with Martinez recounting how his impoverished childhood in the Dominican Republic fostered his competitiveness on the field.
“Ever since I started, I felt like I had no space to fail,” he said. “That’s the kind of challenge you face when you come from a low-income family.”
Retracing his journey from the Dominican Republic to Major League Baseball, Martinez said that much of his motivation to become a better player stemmed from watching his parents struggle to raise six kids.
“It was necessity that took me there, it was the passion for what I did, it was trying to never fail for my family,” he said. “The only way out was through baseball.”
In response to Sandel’s observation that he always seemed to exude palpable joy on the field, Martinez attributed his positive attitude to his passion for the game.
“The way I approach every game is that there is no game tomorrow,” he said. “Having those games where I don’t think I’ll pitch ever again gave me so much joy.”
When the conversation shifted to the dimmer moments of his career, Martinez offered his insight on dealing with defeats both on and off the field. Speaking directly to athletes in the audience, he said, “Keep on fighting, keep on fighting, keep on fighting. And when you did the best you could, don’t feel like you failed. There’s no failure.”
Turning to the broader audience, he added, “It’s the same thing in life.”
Martinez summed up his overall attitude toward baseball when responding to a question on steroid use in professional sports. “I can only explain it to you the way I did it: clean, fun, painful sometimes, but I didn’t want it any other way. I wanted to do it the hard way.”
Students reacted positively to Martinez’s message. “It was so inspiring to hear his story and to hear how passionate he’s been,” Sara K. Rosenburg ’16 said. “He really has a lot of wisdom about things that don’t just apply to baseball.”
S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, said that Martinez is not only a sports hero but also a role model for all Harvard students.
“Everything he said included remarks that are good principles for our students to follow,” Counter said. “The principles of following your beliefs, working very hard at what you do, maintaining the values your family gave you—all of that means something to us.”

Margarita Boenig-Liptsin grew up in the shadow of Chernobyl. She was born just one week after the disaster, 150 kilometers away in Kiev, Ukraine.
“My mom would say, ‘You cannot play under the trees because [of] the radiation,’” she remembers.
The social consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, she said, were the foundation of her interest in Science, Technology, and Society, or STS, an interdisciplinary field that focuses on how scientific knowledge affects culture and politics.
Boenig-Liptsin is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the STS program at the Kennedy School of Government, the primary institution for the field at Harvard. At the same time, STS at Harvard lacks what would be expected of an academic field: formalized degree programs, dedicated coursework, and a general sense of institutionalization.
As such, STS affiliates said they are worried that Harvard is falling behind its peer institutions in the field. A recent push for administrative changes centered on a Ph.D. program, and although progress has stalled, supporters continue to press for change.
“It’s a story of innovation that wants to happen, and then there’s some structural and institutional blockages that prevent it. And it’s very sad. Because I think this field is really essential for a 21st century education,” Boenig-Liptsin said.
Active and globally recognized, Harvard’s STS network is seeking to ingrain itself into the University’s academic structure, striving for a Ph.D. program to produce scholars and teachers for Harvard and beyond.
INSTITUTIONAL BLOCKAGE
Affiliates of Harvard’s STS program have recently advocated for a Ph.D. program in their field, which they consider a vital step in its development at the University.
The current STS network emerged out of a program started in 2002 by Kennedy School professor Sheila S. Jasanoff ’64. It hosts a fellows program, well-attended weekly meetings, a high-profile lecture once a semester, a secondary field for graduate students, and an international network of young STS scholars. Through the program, Harvard is world-renowned for its rigorous and intensive STS research, affiliates said. 
While Jasanoff has about two dozen faculty members across five University schools supporting her program, she goes to enormous lengths to keep it going. Bran S. Shim ’15, who took STS courses as an undergraduate and hopes to pursue a Ph.D. in STS, called her efforts “Herculean.” Even so, the program lacks what many STS scholars would call integral to an academic field at a top research university: a Ph.D. program.
Such a program is a logical next step in the development of a network of undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty members for STS.
“In the ideal case, that whole ecology is in place,” Jasanoff said.
As such, STS affiliates have pushed to place the field more squarely in the academic fabric of Harvard.
In 2013, Jasanoff and two dozen faculty supporters presented a Ph.D. proposal to Xiao-Li Meng, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Faculty members met with the Graduate Policy Committee, which is responsible for reviewing graduate programs and considering Ph.D. proposals. More than a year later, they were notified that the committee voted against the proposal, according to Jasanoff.
In an emailed statement, Meng wrote that the proposal was “considered carefully” by the committee, and that the deans’ offices of GSAS and the Social Science division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are currently in the midst of ongoing discussions regarding the future of STS.
Last spring, graduate students got involved independently of the faculty effort, compiling a dossier of about 150 letters from professors and students around the world about the impact of STS on their intellectual development.  The purpose of the letters was to “call on the administration to take the steps necessary to ensure the future of the field at this university,” according to the cover page.
The group then met with Meng last May. Those involved in the effort have not heard of any conclusions or deliberations from the Graduate Policy Committee, according to Boenig-Liptsin.
“What’s frustrating for me is to see the enormous amount of demand and support in the rest of the world, and to see how little it would take for Harvard to meet that demand, and to find that that’s not happening,” Jasanoff said.
CROSSING THE DIVIDE
Despite the lack of progress in the last year, STS affiliates have continued the Ph.D. program effort, pointing to benefits for the University’s stature and students.
Graduate students specializing in STS are vital to providing the right experience and perspective in teaching the field to undergraduates, according to program supporters. Without graduate students, professors of STS-related undergraduate courses have a difficult time finding qualified teaching fellows, they say.
Professor Venkatesh Narayanamurti, who was the founding dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, taught an STS-centered course, Science of the Physical Universe 24: “Introduction to Technology and Society.” Because he did not have enough TFs with the necessary background in STS, enrollment had to be cut from 139 interested students down to 35, he said. His only TF with a Ph.D. in STS came from a Danish university. 
“I’m looking for people who can cross the divide. Usually I’ve had to recruit these people from other places. Sadly, Harvard is not producing them,” Narayanamurti said.
Many American institutions now have degree programs in STS, including Cornell, Stanford, and MIT. STS is one of the top five most popular undergraduate majors at Stanford.
Charles G. Gertler ’13, a graduate student at MIT who took STS courses as a Harvard undergraduate, said the University, even with a strong STS program, should catch up to the preeminent institutions with which it competes.
“The other world class technical institutions also realize the importance of having an STS program,” Gertler said. “And you have to ask yourself why that is.”
A Ph.D program would focus more attention on bringing faculty members focused on STS to campus. Although many professors—particularly those in the History of Science department and the Environmental Science and Public Policy program—list STS as one of their areas of research, Jasanoff said she is the only faculty member whose main focus is on STS.
Shim said new hires need to be made.
“I understand that there’s a constraint of dollars and you can’t just hire professors left and right. I understand that everyone’s vying for limited resources,” he said. But, he asked, “Can we really not invest in a few more professors that work in this area?”
ALREADY HERE?
A more specialized and dedicated faculty would be the ultimate goal for STS at Harvard, but to STS affiliates, the main obstacle is the perception that such a faculty is already here: the History of Science department. Indeed, on the department’s website, STS is listed as an area of research for eight faculty members.
The issue is not with an underappreciation of STS as a field, but rather in how distinct the two fields should be.
History of Science professor David S. Jones ’92 said he recognizes the importance of STS, but called for a “big tent approach,” in which STS falls under the umbrella of History of Science.
“I’m still convinced that people who want to do good work in STS could do it through existing mechanisms in History of Science or Anthropology, as long as the relevant faculty exist,” Jones said.
But supporters of a distinct STS field said the History of Science department lacks the contemporary lens through which STS often looks at issues, and thus cannot be home to the field as a whole.
“I don’t think that there’s a neglect of the present in the History of Science department, but I do think that STS offers a different set of tools,” said Daniel Z. Wilson ’14, who was involved with STS as a History of Science concentrator.
Jones said that while STS could fit under the umbrella of History of Science, the department is still limited in the field currently.
“If you were to take Sheila out of the question and say, ‘Could the History of Science department adequately prepare people in STS?’ I would say no. I think we’re weak there,” said Jones.
‘EATS OUR LUNCH’
Ultimately, an STS network grounded more firmly in Harvard’s academic structure would affirm the University’s commitment to a liberal arts education among its undergraduates, STS affiliates said.
Bridging seemingly disparate fields, STS is an example of the interdisciplinary nature of modern higher education, they argue, and STS supporters said Harvard may lag behind some of its peers in this regard.
“There’s a risk that Stanford eats our lunch because we’re not getting our hands dirty,” said Jackson S. Salovaara ’11, who was involved with STS as an undergraduate.
For her part, Kyoko Sato, associate director of Stanford’s STS program, said STS at the undergraduate level embodies the “ultimate liberal arts education.”
“We consider that a really important mission for us, to expose our students to the traditions, insights, and legacies of STS. I hope that happens at more places, including at Harvard,” she said.
Supporters said they are optimistic about a greater undergraduate presence for STS as they follow the discussions around the review of the College’s General Education program.
“I’m hopeful that the Gen Ed review will produce a recognition that this particular form of interdisciplinarity…is something that is hugely significant for the training of future citizens and future scholars,” Jasanoff said.
Many STS supporters said they were surprised at how challenging it has been to develop the field at Harvard, given how well they feel it fits into the University’s values.
“When you think about the mission of Harvard and how we’ve affirmed our commitment to the liberal arts, I think it’s a tremendous waste that we wouldn’t spend more time on STS,” Shim said. “It just blows my mind. It’s literally an expression of what Harvard is about, and we don’t do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to the recent news of City Sports’s bankruptcy filing, Harvard students expressed their disappointment at the store’s upcoming closure in the Square.
In October, City Sports Inc., the Boston-based franchise that expanded to 26 locations, ranging from Vermont to Virginia, filed for bankruptcy. 
Initially upon its filing, the company intended to close eight of its stores and sell the remaining ones. However, after failing to find a buyer to keep the remaining stores open, company executives at Highland Consumer Partners opted to liquidate its inventory.
There is currently no set date for the closing of the Brattle Square location, but it will likely be “sometime [in] mid-to-late December,” said Phillip H. Byers, a member of the location's managerial staff. This timeframe will largely depend on the efficacy of a final storewide sale, with discounts reaching up to 90 percent off of the original price, he said.
Rhianna E. G. Rich ’19, a member of the varsity softball team, noted the range of athletic apparel and aptitude of the employees at City Sports.
“I was very impressed with the variety of the athletic gear and the customer service,” she said.
Students from the area are especially disappointed by the closing of City Sports, a presence in Boston since the opening of the first store on Massachusetts Ave. in 1983.
“City Sports is a Boston mainstay, and its closing is symbolic of the unfortunate expansion of national brand name companies at the expense of those businesses that used to constitute the unique business identity particular to the area," said Jackson B. Gates ’19, a Cambridge resident.
Courtney S. Blair ’19, an employee at the Brattle Square venue since September, expressed her dismay at the store’s closure, noting the positive work environment.
“My managers are accommodating around my busy schedule, interested in how I am doing in my classes, and ultimately awesome people to work with,” Blair said. “I am deeply saddened by the announcement of the closing of the Harvard Square location as well as the remaining stores in the chain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Debating at the Institute of Politics on Tuesday, candidates in the Undergraduate Council’s ongoing presidential election weighed in on recent debates about race relations at peer schools and the role of Harvard’s final clubs on campus.
Protests in response to allegations of racism have sprung up in recent weeks on other college campuses, including the University of Missouri and Yale, prompting debate about the experiences of students of color there as well as about the freedom of speech. 
Harvard students have weighed in on those discussions in person and on social media. On Tuesday at the IOP, the UC’s Rules Committee chair, Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, asked candidates for their opinions on a central theme of the conversations at both Yale and Mizzou: the balance between maintaining free speech and preserving the notion of a “safe space” on campus.
William A. Greenlaw ’17, who is running for UC president, said people should uphold free speech while still respecting those on all sides of a conflict.
Candidates Nick E. Gajdzik ’16-’17 and Jeffrey M. Ott ’16-’17, meanwhile, said they understand the importance of free speech, but argued that students’ need to feel safe and comfortable in spaces should also be prioritized in sensitive discussions.
The debate also covered another hot-button topic related to College social life: final clubs. The UC’s Student Relations Committee chair, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, asked the candidates for their opinions of the groups.
At a debate on Saturday co-hosted by The Crimson, each of the three tickets said they would support recognizing single-sex social organizations, even though Harvard does not currently. At Tuesday’s debate, however, each ticket voiced different opinions on how students and administrators alike should discuss and interact with final clubs, the focus of recent administrative scrutiny.
Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17—who are running for president and vice president, respectively—said they hope to bring final clubs “back into the fold” on campus, arguing that different aspects of the College’s social life have “fractured” the student body. In their campaign platform, the pair urges members of final clubs to provide students with membership demographics, they say to determine whether the College’s diversity is reflected among club members.
Gajdzik and Ott, like they voiced at Saturday’s debate, argued that Harvard has made final clubs a “scapegoat” for what they call its own inability to provide students with safe social spaces on campus. Using strong language, Gajdzik said “the University has been inept” on this front.
“Final clubs have existed on this campus for over 100 years at this point,” Gajdzik said. “They’ve just now become an issue because of the social space issue, because there aren’t social spaces that exist on this campus.”
Greenlaw and running mate William F. Morris IV ’17 said that, if elected, they would work with the final clubs to encourage safer party habits, such as designating a sober member for every club event.
Candidates also discussed to what extent they intend to rely on Harvard administrators to accomplish their goals if they are elected. At both debates this election season, all three tickets lauded current Council leaders, Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 for what they said was their success in interacting with Harvard’s administration.
Unlike their predecessors, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal have focused their efforts on initiatives, like smart phone applications, that depend less on administrators. 
Rather and Banks, emphasizing a belief that “the administration is our biggest ally,” said they need to accomplish goals alongside, rather than against, College and University leadership.
The voting period for this week’s election, already open, will close at 9 p.m. on Thursday. The deadline was extended by nine hours in response to the bomb threat, ultimately deemed unfounded, that prompted an evacuation of four campus buildings on Monday. There was also an issue with the online voting interface.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas discussed his experience as an undocumented immigrant and well-known immigration activist at a Harvard Republican Club event on Tuesday.
Vargas has filmed several documentaries, including CNN’s “Documented” and MTV’s “White People.”
After revealing himself as an undocumented immigrant in 2011 through an essay in The New York Times Sunday Magazine, Vargas said he was shocked when nothing happened. He had been expecting to face arrest and deportation immediately, he said, but for whatever reason, his life carried on as it had before.
“I’m not trying to be politically correct here. I am here illegally. If the cops wanted to show up and detain me, they can,” Vargas said. “But I as a person am not illegal. For me, the culture has to shift first, and unfortunately we’re not there yet.”
Vargas founded the non-profit “Define American,” which looks to start a dialogue about diversity and what it means to be an American.
“I actually think immigrants in this country show Americans what it is to be American,” he said. “Because no matter what you call us, no matter whatever barrier you put in front of us, we’re going to do it.”
Aaron I. Henricks ’16, the former president of the Republican Club, organized the event by reaching out to Vargas on Twitter.
“I’m always happy when we can get someone who disagrees with the mainstream Republican views because it challenges us and I think sets a good precedent for what campus dialogue should be all about,” Henricks said.
After recounting the aftermath of divulging his undocumented status, Vargas fielded questions from the roughly 40-person audience in a Science Center lecture hall. Some challenged Vargas’s viewpoints; one student asked if he would support permanent legal status without a pathway to citizenship. Vargas called that second-class citizenship.
Vargas said he has been reaching out to more young Republicans around the country.
“When people think of the Republican Party, they think it’s anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-women’s rights, anti-black,” Vargas said. “I don’t want to live in a country like that. We need two parties to actually have debate.”
Leanne R. Trujillo, a student at the Graduate School of Education and a self-described supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, said she was curious to hear some of the questions from the College Republicans.
“This definitely showed me that there has been a shift since the time I was an undergraduate,” Trujillo said. “I don’t think I would have ever seen an event [like this] run by college Republicans.”
Attendee Ana R. Andrade ’19 said she personally knows some undocumented immigrants in the Boston area who are business owners and taxpayers. Two Harvard students who identified themselves as undocumented also asked questions during the question-and-answer session.
“I think it was just really eye-opening for Harvard students to start to realize that undocumented students are on this campus, and they’re your classmates sitting right next to you,” Andrade said.
Vargas previously spoke at Harvard and argued for the need for more open conversation about racial equality and immigration at an Askwith Forum in March.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing difficult conditions, the Harvard sailing team raced to mixed results this weekend in its second-to-last regatta of the fall.
The Crimson sent a small contingent of sailors to Norfolk, Va. to compete in the Atlantic Coast Championship and finished seventh. Co-captains Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky raced as the Harvard A-division entry, while senior Marek Zaleski and juniors Julia Lord and Olivia Kjorlien formed the team’s B-division crew. Lord and Kjorlien split time in the boat throughout the weekend.
The Crimson took on a slate of 18 teams that featured many of the programs Harvard has raced all season, including Boston College, Boston University, Georgetown, Coast Guard, and Yale.
The regatta kicked off with favorable conditions, but they would not last. Although the breeze stayed consistent early on Saturday, the wind became trickier later in the day, with sharp changes in speed making for some unpredictable sailing.
“The weather this weekend suited our team,” Zaleski said. “We have a pretty good all-around crew, so we were prepared for anything.”
The Crimson’s A-division crew took advantage of the conditions and got off to a quick start on Saturday. The boat recorded three top-four finishes in the first day of racing, including a win, and never ended up outside of the top half.
The B-division crew started off more slowly, but found its footing later in the day, recording several top-10 results, highlighted by a third-place finish.
At the end of the first day of racing, Harvard sat in eighth, six points behind seventh-place New York Maritime. Yale held a decisive advantage over the field, with seven top-three finishes contributing to a 15-point lead over next-fastest Coast Guard.
However, the second day of the regatta saw both the weather and the order of finishers change. Facing unpredictable winds, the racing was postponed, and each division was only able to race once on Sunday in the mercurial conditions.
Nonetheless, the Crimson moved up a spot from Saturday to finish seventh overall on the weekend. Harvard’s A crew ended up fourth of 18, while the B-division entry made the most of its one race on Sunday, finishing first to end up 11th overall.
In the end, the Crimson finished two points behind sixth-place hosts Old Dominion. Coast Guard overtook Yale to win overall, and Georgetown, Boston College, and Charleston rounded out the list of finishers ahead of Harvard.
The result was the Crimson’s highest finish at the regatta in the last three years. Harvard has steadily improved since a 14th-place result at the same event in 2013, ending up in 11th last year on its way to this weekend’s top-10 finish.
“We would have liked to do a bit better, and we made some elementary mistakes, but overall this was the best performance we've had at a championship-level event in a long time,” Zaleski said.
Several of the teams that topped the Crimson this weekend are opponents that Harvard has traded results with all season, most notably Yale.
Although the Bulldogs came out on top in Norfolk, the two teams have had close finishes throughout the fall. Harvard has bested Yale by just one spot on several occasions this fall, including a one-point victory over the Bulldogs in the Pine Trophy in September. This weekend, top-four finishes for both Yale’s A and B-division entries gave the Bulldogs the edge over the Crimson.
The weekend’s outcome was the latest in a string of strong performances for Harvard this season. The team has brought home top-three finishes on nine occasions this fall, including wins in the Central Series 1, Moody Trophy, and NE Match Race Championships. This season also marks the first time since 2000 that the Crimson has sent three vessels to national championship races.
Now, bolstered by another promising result, the team can look forward to its final race of the fall, the ICSA Match Race National Championship next weekend, as well as to the spring season.
“This was a really tough regatta,” sophomore Kevin Coakley said. “It’s a tough field of competitors, so [this result] definitely bodes well for our spring season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team (1-1) split its two opening contests—beating crosstown rival MIT by 20 and losing to Providence on the road by 12. The Crimson return home to take on the UMass Minutemen (1-0) tonight at 7:00. Beat writer David Freed details three things to watch below.
1. Starting Afresh — Of the 10 starters in last year’s game between the two teams, just one—senior Agunwa Okolie—will begin the game tonight. Both programs have suffered from departures of leading stars, either to graduation (Cady LaLanne, Wesley Saunders ’15), injury (senior Siyani Chambers), or transfer (Derrick Gordon). That makes it difficult to take anything away from the teams’ classic last year—a three-point Harvard victory where neither team led by more than three in the final 17 minutes. As a result, while last year’s game presented two fairly polished products, the two teams that take the court Tuesday will still be in their formative phases.
2. Changing of the Guard — UMass coach Derek Kellogg spotlighted his team’s backcourt advantage in a weekend interview; given that the Crimson start two freshmen, Corey Johnson and Tommy McCarthy, Kellogg expects to press the issue. Johnson and McCarthy have been the two leading Harvard scorers through two games, however, combining for 23.5 points a game.
The former is the team’s best floor spacer, making eight treys across two contests and a gunner mentality from deep. McCarthy has struggled with his shot (2-for-13 against Providence) but has been a steadier hand at the point than juniors Corbin Miller and Matt Fraschilla, the latter out with an undiagnosed injury. UMass guards Jabarie Hinds and Donte Clark will look to exploit the two freshmen early and often. Yet, McCarthy and Johnson—who commented Saturday that the team should never be satisfied with close losses in big games—will likely be ready for the challenge.
3. Pace and Space — The elements of “pace and space” in the Crimson’s offensive sets are subtle but present. After a year where the Crimson struggled mightily with spacing, the introduction of two very ready—and capable—shooters in the backcourt has created a freer floor for the Crimson. Johnson in particular runs through screen after screen with free rein to bomb away (7.5 three-point attempts a game). Many of his attempts come in transition, where McCarthy pushes the pace to find easy looks early and often. UMass likes to run—it ranked 51st in KenPom’s adjusted tempo metric last year—and will force the Crimson’s inexperienced guards to make snap decisions time and time again. Harvard’s ability to do so will largely decide the outcome.

Matchups with Ivy League opponents often define the Harvard athletics experience. The Harvard-Yale football game is a tradition that dates back to 1897, and it’s a contest that is often the definitive moment in the Crimson’s season, especially for fans. It is perhaps Harvard’s most important and well-known sporting event along with possibly the Head of the Charles regatta.
Given all of the tradition and rivalry amongst the members of the Ancient Eight, competition against non-league opponents can often be overlooked, becoming footnotes in schedules headlined by matchups with fellow Ivy League schools.
For the football team, the non-conference games that head coach Tim Murphy schedules all have a specific purpose. Since most games against non-league opponents are played earlier in the year than games against other Ivy teams, Murphy seeks to build some winning momentum before challenging games against teams like Dartmouth and Penn.
“I think because you tend to play your out-of-league games early in the season, it makes sense that you would want to develop some confidence,” Murphy said.
Although the schedule seems to intensify as the season progresses, the Ivy League matchups early in the year are not as easy for the team as they may appear.
“We’ve had a great run against Brown, but they’ve actually been probably the third winningest team in our league over the past 15 years,” Murphy said. “People think Cornell is an easy game, and going into the 1997 season...Cornell had beaten us 12 straight years. It’s all a matter of context. None of those games seem easy.”
Aside from scheduling these few contests based on level of competition, there are a handful of other factors that go into Coach Murphy’s decision-making process.
Schools with good recruiting bases and alumni bases are important to have on the schedule for the Crimson. The University of San Diego and Georgetown are just two examples of schools Harvard has faced in recent years that fit that profile, and strong academic Division I schools are also important in Murphy’s scheduling efforts.
Regardless of the teams that end up on Harvard’s schedule in any given year, the team’s philosophy remains the same for non-conference games as it is for the yearly Ivy League matchups.
“Our mindset is that we can beat anyone on our schedule,” Murphy said.
Football is one of the more popular sports on campus in terms of fan interest and viewership, but golf is a sport with a smaller following that has a schedule that can be just as interesting. Since the men’s and women’s golf teams participate in tournaments rather than individual matchups with other schools, the Crimson’s league and non-league competition often compete at the same events.
According to men’s and women’s golf coach Kevin Rhoads, the two major factors in deciding what events the teams will participate are the level of competition and playing in tournaments where there is optimal weather in late fall and early spring.
“It’s usually based on time of year when we need to augment our tournament schedule and find the best weather that we possibly can,” Rhoads said. “Nearing the end of the fall and early in the spring, we tend to be out of region for one tournament on each [team].”
On Sept. 12, the women’s team traveled to Finkbine Golf Course in Iowa for the Diane Thomason Invitational, in which the Crimson placed fourth out of 12 teams. The tournament included non-conference opponents from as close as Boston University to as far away as South Dakota State, North Florida, and Wichita State.
From Nov. 2 to Nov. 4, the men’s side was in Carlsbad, Calif., for the Gifford Collegiate Championship, which was hosted by UCLA. Harvard was the only Ivy League school to enter the tournament, and the team competed against top national competitors, including No. 5 Stanford and No. 25 South Florida.
Harvard men’s water polo is another team that often travels across the country to participate in tournaments.
This year, the team made a trip out to the West Coast to compete in the Santa Clara Bronco Invite. Playing in California and matching up with Golden State teams like San Jose State, Santa Clara, Fresno Pacific, and UC Davis gave the Crimson a chance to mix things up and play a different style of water polo.
Men’s water polo typically travels to California once a year, alternating between venues in Northern and Southern California, depending on the year.
“The California tournament is always refreshing for our team in general,” junior Dan Stevens said. “A lot of us are from California. It’s nice to get back outside, playing in outdoor pools and playing against California teams.”
According to Stevens, traveling as a team to face non-conference opponents away from Cambridge also has a positive effect on the team’s bonding and morale.
“When we went 5-0 [in Santa Clara], I think that a lot of that was a product of increased team chemistry and us coming together as a unit,” Stevens added.
The change of scenery certainly worked well for the Crimson this season. Before the California trip, Harvard was struggling to find its rhythm and was at .500 with a 9-9 record. The five wins at the Santa Clara Bronco Invite sparked a winning streak that extended to 10 games at its peak.
“I think that tournament is when our defense started coming together, and when we hold teams under 10 goals, we’re undefeated [for the season],” Stevens said. “Holding a team to two goals, especially a good team like Santa Clara, was a huge step for us in the right direction.”
Though Harvard teams’ typical schedules are defined by the school’s standing as a member of the historic Ivy League, contests against teams from outside the Ancient Eight can be just as competitive, if not more so. The Crimson teams often step onto the same court or field as top Division I programs in the nation, determined to demonstrate Harvard’s athletic clout outside the Ancient Eight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: November 18, 2015, at 2:57 p.m. 
­According to Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, the men’s basketball team is still trying to find itself.
After ending the weekend with a loss in Providence, the Crimson (1-2) fell again Tuesday, losing to UMass (2-0), 69-63. Cold shooting—Harvard shot just 35 percent from the floor—and defensive matchups forced Amaker to try out new lineups, but the adjustments were not enough to come away with the victory.
“As we’re going through this season right now, we are trying to find ourselves a little bit,” Amaker said. “Looking at some of our shooters and our shooting performance, I’m not sure even how we stayed close to be very honest.”
Tuesday’s game was a game of runs. While Harvard went into the locker room down just four at the half, the Minutemen extended the lead midway through the second frame, capping off the offensive outburst with a layup by UMass forward Zach Coleman, giving the Minutemen a 55-40 lead.
Amaker has stressed the importance of the first four minutes of each half so far in the young season, but the first four minutes of the second half—when UMass stretched a four-point halftime lead to 12—represented the biggest struggle for the Crimson in Tuesday’s game.
“We got into a little bit of a funk there,” Amaker said. “I thought they came right at us right at the start of the second half and I thought that was the key stretch of the game very much so and put us on our heels.”
A few minutes later, however, the Crimson went on a run of its own. Down 59-48 with just over eight minutes to go, Amaker signalled for a timeout after a steal and uncontested layup for UMass guard Jabarie Hinds. After the timeout, junior guard Corbin Miller hit a long two-pointer to cut the lead to single digits and jump start a 11-2 run, pulling Harvard within a basket.
With freshmen guards Tommy McCarthy and Corey Johnson struggling, Amaker moved Miller to the point for the majority of the second half.
“I thought [Miller] settled us,” Amaker said. “He managed our team in addition to trying to look for opportunities to score. He made a couple timely baskets for us, one right in front of our bench when he shot faked and stepped into the corner, that kind of settled us and gave us a little confidence to try to make a comeback.”
But the momentum wasn’t enough. The Minutemen would go on to score 10 of the game’s last 14 points to seal the victory. After Hinds hit two from the charity stripe and lengthened the UMass lead to six, Miller missed two desperation threes in the final minute.
Although Harvard struggled on offense, defense kept the game as close as it was at many points through the first half. Behind the defense of senior Agunwa Okolie, the Crimson defense limited the Minutemen to just 32 percent shooting in the first half, leading for nearly seven minutes before a 10-2 UMass spurt to end the half.
UMass came back to shoot 52 percent in the second half, but one area in which it had success was limiting Hinds, who had 20 of his team’s 38 points in the first. After the break, Amaker shifted Okolie to cover Hinds, and the senior limited him to just four points in the second frame.
The biggest problem for Okolie was that there was only one of him. He successfully prevented UMass leading scorer Trey Davis from having a breakout first half—holding him to just four points—but Davis found more success when Okolie moved to Hinds, scoring nine points after the break.
“Agunwa has to guard the most productive or efficient player on the perimeter for our opponents,” Amaker said. “He had the kid Davis for the first half and just did a sensational job...then Hinds gets going so we put Agunwa on Hinds in the second half and [Okolie] does a pretty good job and then Davis kind of has a bigger impact in the second half.”
Junior Zena Edosomwan provided a bright spot for the otherwise struggling Harvard offense. Edosomwan had a career-high 18 points on the night, but it was his rebounding that he found more important. Edosomwan finished with 15 boards, six of which came on the offensive end.
“[Rebounding]’s how I kind of always want things to start, but that’s not how it’s always going to start,” Edosomwan said. “If I can start with simple baskets, getting good post position, easy stuff then that’s kind of how I want to play the game.”

As my recent trip to Manhattan confirmed, Harvard is not as creative as I previously thought.
Turns out that Securitas is not a play on the word “veritas.”
It was late summer. I was waiting in line to watch a concert at Central Park, just minding my own business, trying to hide my simultaneous excitement and annoyance with the youths around me.
I get to the security entrance of the concert when I notice that the man who patted me down—his name was Freddie—was wearing the Securitas jacket I always associated Harvard’s friendly security force.
All of a sudden, I was transported back to walking down Harvard Yard, observing HUPD officers ride around in their electric tricycles and Securitas officers meandering about, securitizing things or something.
How could it be that the people I entrusted to protect me at Harvard were also in New York City? Did they follow me here? Is this part of Harvard’s plan to make sure that students feel secure at all times, even once they leave school? Great job, Harvard.
Or so I thought. Turns out that Securitas is a Swedish security company that has outposts all over the country. Harvard, you’re not as original as I once thought.
Sidenote: It also turns out we aren’t original in our motto.
Here’s a short list of other colleges with the word veritas in their motto:
*Note, there are also a bunch of other international schools with the same motto.

Dear Dartmouth,
We here at Flyby recently heard that you have announced plans to change your current housing system to resemble more closely the residential housing system that schools like Harvard and Yale employ. After that crushing defeat a few weeks ago by our seemingly unstoppable football team, who could blame you for trying to make yourself more like us?
Be warned, Dartmouth: residential housing is one of the best configurations possible in undergraduate housing, but if the lines are not drawn clearly and effectively, the end result will be disastrous. Here are some things you could learn from Harvard:
Do: Make a big deal about this housing processHarvard is notorious for our Housing Day celebration, which pretty much puts us on par with Hogwarts (I’m pretty sure one of our alumni has a sorting hat stowed away in their garage). If you make the process laden with pomp and circumstance, the excitement from its kickoff will carry over and become a large part of the appeal of the residential system.
Don’t: Pretend all houses are created equalStudents do not need to be acutely aware of that some houses are clearly better than others. Make sure that you highlight the best parts of the various houses so that students have something to look forward to. They can discover the rat problems, cockroach legions and drafty rooms when the time comes for it.
Do: Make an effort to include those students who reside in off-campus housingOur housing system makes it so that the majority of our upperclassmen choose to remain in their houses through to graduation, but the abundance of alternative housing options for Dartmouth undergraduates presents a different environment.
Don’t: Be annoying about itIf students don’t want to participate in housing activities, breathing down their neck about it injects the entire experience with negativity. Some students won’t want to be part of their assigned housing communities, and that’s okay.
Do: Make sure you bolster social spaces in all of the current housing optionsThis is probably one of the most polarizing issues Harvard is facing now: there’s an overabundance of study spaces, but not enough spaces for students to chill and get #turnt.
Don’t: Fall into the trap of creating housing bubblesCommunity is important, but if students find themselves trapped socializing with only the people inside of their houses, you are removing a chance for greater social development. Interaction between houses is imperative.
At the end of the day, creating a residential housing system is hard work. But you’re clearly getting advice from the school who's done the best with the system so far. (We don’t like to talk about our counterpart. They think they’ve got housing down to a science, but that’s only true if you’re in the market for a good dog kennel.)
Good luck, Dartmouth.

A line of rakes cuts through the north half of the Yard. Some stand upright, driven into the ground, and many more lean against trees next to piles of leaves. These mysterious gardening implements are neither as colorful nor as practical as our beloved Yard chairs (#rip till spring), but that didn’t stop Flyby from getting to the bottom of the Yard’s newest decorations.
Turns out, the rakes are there in preparation for RakeHarvard, “Harvard’s First-Ever People-Powered Rake-In,” according to Harvard’s sustainability website. If the number of hyphens in that title leaves your head spinning with questions – what is a ‘rake-in’? Is Harvard making us do chores as a cost-cutting method? If so, will there at least be food? – you’re not alone.
According to RakeHarvard organizer Arif Khan, a Loeb Fellow at the Graduate School of Design, the point of the event is to encourage people to get together and meet each other, have a good time, and have a “positive environmental impact.”
“I went for a walk in Harvard Yard and it was a beautiful day...and all of a sudden these leaf blowers descended on the Yard and I thought, ‘Gosh, there must be a better way,’” said Khan on his inspiration for hosting the event. He hopes that it will be picked up on other campuses as a way to decrease the environmental impact of using leaf blowers while also promoting a fun way to relieve stress.
The event starts Wednesday, November 18th in the Yard, and will have Insomnia cookies and other food. And in case you want to work off the Freshman (or Sophomore, or Junior…) 15, at 1:30 there will be a “Rake-Fit” class, which promises to combine music and total-body conditioning with, you guessed it, rakes. Sounds like a perfect combination to make it onto the Ivy League Snapchat Story. And at the very least, it’s cheaper than SoulCycle.

Hate it: "The winter is for hot coffee" by Ignacio "Nacho" Sabate
It’s common knowledge that coffee is the closest thing to hard evidence that God exists. It’s also true that iced coffee is the closest evidence we have of the Devil.
The history of coffee is pretty interesting. Wikipedia taught me that according to African myth, the first coffee drinker was a ninth century Ethiopian herder who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant. Whether or not this story is factual, the point is that people have been drinking coffee for a long time. Coffee was, almost always, prepared and consumed exclusively with hot water.
Why, then, is it that in the past few decades, this thing we called iced coffee has taken the U.S. by storm? I, for one, reject the invitation to join the movement.
Above all else, iced coffee tastes terrible. I often feel like people are convinced it tastes good. The real taste of the coffee is masked when it’s cold, and in my opinion, the coffee itself tastes even more bitter when chilled. Most people seem to agree with me on this point— haven’t you ever noticed that when people drink iced coffee, it’s almost always 50 percent coffee, 50 percent half & half, plus seven packets of sugar?
I’m looking at you, Dunkin' Donuts.
And don’t get me started on the ice. Oh, the ice! What blasphemy. As people take their sweet time drinking their oversized cups of milk and sugar (plus some coffee) due to the acrid taste, the ice melts, making the already terrible coffee even more watery.
The craziest thing, by far, about iced coffee is that it’s often pricier than its warm counterpart. What extras are you paying for? Ice cubes? Sugar? The image of being hip and progressive? Being counterculture and anti-establishment?
A few weeks ago I went on a date with someone who said, “I even drink iced coffee in the middle of winter.” I have not talked to said subject since.

Love it: "Nacho is un-American" by Christopher J. Riley 
Nacho, my esteemed colleague, you are dead wrong. Not only that, I suspect you might be un-American and possibly a devil worshipper. How else could you possibly justify drinking hot coffee at any point, even in the winter?
Let me start with some of your own claims. “[P]eople have been drinking coffee for a long time. Coffee was, almost always, prepared and consumed exclusively with hot water.” Want to know what else people did for a long time: blood-letting, rain dances, and mathematics. Two out of three of those things are ridiculous (jury’s still out on rain-dances, since my experiments have been inconclusive). Just because people have done thing one way for a long time doesn’t mean we ought to keep doing it. Oh, what the Harvard Philosophy Department would say about your appeal to authority.
You also claimed that iced coffee tastes terrible, then threw serious shade at Dunks. As a lifelong Boston resident, let me just ask: how dare you? First of all, classy ad hominem attack on a glorious corporation. Second of all, you’re basing that assumption on the misguided principle that iced coffee is just coffee with ice in it. If we’re being progressive enough to dump ice in a traditionally hot beverage, let’s take it a step further: fill it with milk, sugar, pumps of mocha or caramel. Heck, let’s even ask for a hazelnut or a french vanilla iced coffee every now and then to keep things interesting. Iced coffee only tastes terrible if you have no creativity.
I will cede that iced coffee costing more than hot coffee seems unnecessary, but that’s capitalism for ya. The people want it. Supply and demand. N. Gregory Mankiw.
Ok, we’re all on the same page? Good. Now let’s move on to some important arguments in favor of iced coffee in the winter.
First off, it makes you look tough. I’ve already pointed out that iced coffee and customization are peas of a pod; peas designed to make you look hip and help you develop your own identity as a coffee drinker. But iced coffee and trendiness also go hand-in-hand. Picture this: it’s 24 degrees out and you see me, probably in a trench coat and sunglasses, holding a cup full of iced liquid. You’re not going to want to mess with that.
Second of all, hot beverages in the winter are unnatural. Your body is trying to adjust to the remarkable difference between its internal 98.6 and the external 24. Now you’re going to throw it for a loop by slurping down some beans filtered into 130 degree water? No way, Jose. That’s how injuries happen. That’s science, Nacho.
A few weeks ago, while Nacho was on a date with someone he (rudely) never spoke to again, I was watching Netflix alone. In an episode of 30 Rock, Kenneth Parcells dropped some wisdom about hot coffee: “I don’t drink hot liquids of any kind. That’s the devil’s temperature.” Checkmate.
