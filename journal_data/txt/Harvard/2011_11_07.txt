Writing is like sex: The best way to learn is by doing. Studying other people’s techniques can be helpful—but only to a certain extent. At a certain point, you have to grab your preferred medium and dive in. Your first experience will probably not be very satisfying. You shouldn’t allow the possibility of disappointment or fear of underperformance to stop you. If you do, your skills will never improve. You won’t get better right away, but, if you keep at it, over time, you’ll inevitably see significant improvement. And to get to this point, you have to give yourself the freedom to fail at first. Anne Lamott devotes a section of Bird by Bird, her successful and influential book about the craft of writing, to extolling the virtues of “shitty” first drafts. “All good writers write them. This is how they end up with good second drafts and terrific third drafts,” Lamott explains. In order to get to the one terrific paragraph at the end of page six, you have to give yourself permission to write five lousy pages first.
This month, hundreds of thousands of people are employing this literary approach by taking part in National Novel Writing Month. National Novel Writing Month, commonly referred to as NaNoWriMo, is a web-based writing “challenge” now in its 11th year which challenges participants to write a 50,000-word novel in 30 days. NaNoWriMo counsels participants to understand that “You will be writing a lot of crap. And that’s a good thing. By forcing yourself to write so intensely, you are giving yourself permission to make mistakes. To forgo the endless tweaking and editing and just create. To build without tearing down.”
This premise is laudable, and the high word count goal and limited timeframe can be an effective way of forcing writers to conquer their fears of failure and just write, but these same requirements can also have more problematic consequences. These benefits and dangers are evident in the NaNoWriMo online forums. One of the message boards in the Tips & Strategies section is titled “Reaching 50,000.” The subtitle: “Everything from deep spiritual wisdom to down-and-dirty-word-count tricks to help keep that book moving along to the 50K finish line.” I’m all in favor of tips for avoiding procrastination. But some of the tips on the NaNoWriMo forum are not just unhelpful—they’re detrimental.
In the original post of a thread entitled “Down and Dirty Tricks for reaching word count,” which has already amassed over 400 responses, one participant offers his/her personal strategies for boosting word count without cheating and urges other writers to share their methods.
One writer suggests over-complicating everything, and provides the following horrifying example of such a technique: "And he did then, with much gusto, verily grip his fingers around the weisswurst, a german sausage made from the meat of veal, otherwise known as baby cows or calves."
Another writer astutely points out that letting loose and not concentrating on omitting anything superfluous can actually help you discover new and valuable things about your characters and story. I agree. But this same writer then advocates going through your draft and eliminating all contractions. “They’ll all sound like Jane Austin [sic], but you’ll be amazed how the word count jumps,” this writer advises.
Fortunately, not all writers share this outlook. As one explains, “Not necessarily everything I write for my NaNo will be good, but I'm not going to intentionally put in garbage like that…50,000 words doesn't mean much to me if I didn't reach it in an honest fashion.”
There is a fine—and critical—line between prioritizing quantity over quality and prioritizing quantity at the deliberate expense of quality. The former involves allowing yourself the freedom to write things that might be bad. Great writing can emerge from this approach, as Anne Lamott explains. Your first draft may be shitty, but, if you’re lucky, not all of it will be. Whether you’re writing a novel or a paper for class, getting all of your ideas onto the page is a critical first step to producing a good piece of writing. If you pack your pages with deliberately useless space fillers in order to meet a length requirement, you do yourself a disservice.
Length matters—but it’s not the only thing that matters.

Wall Street is still occupied. So is Boston. So is the City of London, where officials at St. Paul’s Cathedral and the wider Anglican Church have become embroiled in a major row with authorities over their refusal to evict protesters from the steps of the Cathedral. Over the previous month, we have voiced skepticism over the movement’s potential to see its grievances addressed, and argued that the Occupy protesters would do better making use of the democratic institutions at their disposal. Yet despite these concerns, it is striking how well Occupy Wall Street has sustained itself over the past month and spread from what was originally a demonstration in New York City to a movement with real global reach. Many expected these acts of civil disobedience to remain confined to a few fall weekends. Instead, as evidenced by the large demonstration in Oakland last Wednesday, Occupy continues to grow and surprise with both its energy and knack for cropping up in places less expected than downtown Manhattan.
Occupy has never had a coherent structure nor seemingly aspired to one. Heading toward the end of the year, it and its derivatives have truly made 2011 a year of global dissent, despite this dissent coming in many different forms. It is thus all the more compelling that disparate and largely disorganized manifestations of the original Occupy Wall Street respond and act in solidarity with each other. The ability to attract so many students, who were noticeably absent as a major demographic within the Tea Party and from protests against the Iraq War, bears striking resemblances to the Obama campaign in 2008 and gives the movement a sense of accomplishment just by energizing our notoriously apathetic generation of Americans. In Boston, many of these students have protested against the burden of student loans, launching a new issue under the Occupy banner and responding to the electric, populist nature of its anti-Wall Street anger.
More and more, we appear to be witnessing the creation of a new strand of political activism that is inescapably worth attention precisely because it does things differently. The inclusive and participatory nature of its General Assembly and decision-making processes are of course worthy of commendation themselves; however, Occupy’s obsession with total democracy in everything it does has also furnished observers with its great diversity of opinion and concerns. So far, the opinions of the alleged 99 percent have not been subsumed into one brief list of problems and proposed changes. This does make Occupy’s events and the orchestration of these events more subtle than many, including this newspaper, have previously given them credit for.
Since Occupy remains, for the moment, geared away from working actively toward the redress of its participants’ grievances, we hope that its engagement translates across the sphere of political involvement and activism. Occupy remains a street protest; policy changes will not emerge out of a campsite in Dewey Square, much less would it appear this campsite’s inhabitants are eager for it to take on this role. Their efforts would be complemented by greater, mass individual involvement at the local and national electoral levels. More of the population, especially more young people and more minorities, needs to be voting. More people should pressure their representatives, and more individuals should get involved themselves in local politics. In the end, the situations out of which these grievances arose and which have animated so many people will not be solved except through engagement within our existing political structures. Together, we can hope to address massive inequality more effectively and build a stronger democracy. Occupy becomes increasingly the inspiration for greater action, not the means of achieving results.

The Occupy (Wall Street, Boston, Oakland, et al.) movements are putting a spotlight not only on Wall Street but also on those who may not be part of the so-called one percent, but who have profited or hope to profit from the broadly destructive greedy behavior of Wall Street. As Chris Hedges puts it in his new book, Death of the Liberal Class, “The media, the church, the University, the Democratic Party, the arts, and labor unions—the pillars of the liberal class—have been bought off with corporate money and promises of scraps tossed to them by the narrow circles of power.”
Since the Occupy movement shows no signs of going away—quite the contrary—we also may be in the somewhat awkward position of seeking largesse from those entities that have seemed most to contribute to the misery of much of the population, while purporting as a liberal arts college—whatever that is coming to mean—to teach the values of equality, justice and fairness.
In this are we possibly dealing with an updated version of the awkwardness our colleagues at Brown felt a few years ago when President Ruth Simmons set up a commission to examine that institution’s enrichment from the transatlantic slave trade? Are all institutions such as ours now facing a version of that? Does it matter where the scraps come from?
If we feel discomfort about any of this one question immediately arises: How do we behave as educators and mentors, in an institution which sends a large percentage of its students into the financial industry? A recent Crimson article seems to respond by applauding the fact that a higher proportion of our students are now hired by consultancy firms, though still fewer than the numbers that head for Wall St. I confess I had never really known what McKinsey, a frequently mentioned name among consultancy forms, actually does. The Crimson article cleared that up for me: “Even still, students of all concentrations, from Classics to Molecular and Cellular Biology, apply for the opportunity to examine the workings of corporations and improve their profitability.”
Oh, O.K., got it. Maybe they also create Library Affinity Groups (another story). But no enquiry here whether examining the workings of corporations and improving their profitability might involve union-busting, promoting Knowledge Process Outsourcing (which sounds better than pushing jobs offshore), or devising strategies for lobbying in the interests of expanded fossil fuel energy legislation and confounding alternative and greener energy options.
It is remarkable how often our institution’s name seems to be connected with the consultancy and banking industries, many of whose avaricious captains were the most prominent in creating a profit-driven climate that seems inimical to all we should stand for as teachers and students in a liberal arts college. If in reality a large part of what we what we are doing here is supplying new generations of worker-bees for these hives, how do we do so in a way that does not implicate us in what looks like an unending charge towards unfettered capitalism?
Marina Bolotnikova '14 of Eliot House perhaps puts it best, from last week's Crimson, in directing us away from pure vocationalism: “The philosophy of a liberal education maintains that the liberal arts are valuable in and of themselves, that a liberal education necessarily makes us better citizens.
It is high time we actually confronted how precisely we are to become and how we are to produce those better citizens, how we can make sure what we teach and what we value at least has a chance of leading to a more just, fair and humane world than the one we seem to have right now.

As campaigns gear up, citizens are starting to pay attention to the upcoming election, wondering which Republican will be the nominee or figuring out where candidates stand on the issues important to them. Yet the most important thing that American voters should do is figure out the new restrictions on their eligibility to vote in the next election. Throughout the country, Republicans have passed harsh and unjust voter restrictions that will make it more difficult for millions of people to vote, and indeed, might have already decided the election a year before it takes place.
A recent New York Times report catalogues the new voting restrictions that have been passed throughout the country this year. Wisconsin, Kansas, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas have passed laws requiring voters to bring a government-issued photo ID to the polling booth. The Brennan Center for Justice has estimated that these measures will impact 3.2 million voters, and it is likely that the voters without identification will be poor and minority voters.
The measures have been passed with the stated purpose of combating voter fraud. The theory is that stricter laws will make voter fraud more challenging and thus less likely. Yet it is hard to take this argument seriously, given the impartial data that shows how rare voter fraud is: South Carolina’s Election Commission told the New York Times that they know “of no confirmed cases of voter identification fraud, defined as a person presenting himself to vote as someone he is not.” A five-year effort from the Justice Department from 2002 to 2007 found “virtually no evidence of any sustained effort to skew federal elections.” In a democracy of over 100 million voters, there will be cases when isolated individuals make errors in voting, but these are trivial statistical occurrences that do not merit a serious increase in voter restrictions.
Surveys show that voters think that fraud is a common occurrence, but studies and data show that this is a case in which popular conception is far removed from reality. Any politicians, Republican or Democrat, who argue that voter fraud is common should not be taken seriously if they do not have any substantial evidence to back up their assertions.
The vast majority of these new voter restrictions are passed by Republican state legislatures, and it is no coincidence that the voters that are disenfranchised by these laws are poor, minority, and disabled voters, also known as the Democratic base. To get a sense of the tangible impact of the laws, 21 million Americans do not have government-issued photo identification. This includes 25 percent of African-American voting-age citizens, as opposed to eight percent of white citizens, and 15 percent of voters earning less than $35,000, “more than twice” as many as citizens who earn more than $35,000.
These laws go against the fundamental foundations of our democracy, and the idea that every citizen should easily be able to have their say in an election. They are also clearly unconstitutional. In Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of Indiana’s new voter identification law. In his dissent, Justice Souter discussed the various costs associated with obtaining the technically free government-issued photo identification. These included transportation costs (and associated loss of work salary) for citizens who most likely would not have cars and the financial costs associated with obtaining a birth certificate or passport, burdens that would weigh disproportionately on the poor and immobile.
When combined with the fact that there was no “shred of evidence” that “voter impersonation [was] a problem in the state,” Souter argued that “the law imposes an unreasonable and irrelevant burden on voters who are poor and old.” The Supreme Court ruled in1966 that poll taxes are unconstitutional because they violate the 14th Amendment, and these new voter identification laws, with sizable associated costs, are, for all practical purposes, poll taxes.
The Obama Administration has belatedly started to fight these laws in court, but given the increasingly conservative leanings of the federal judiciary and the fact that there are only 10 months before voting will start in earnest for 2012, it is unclear whether their legal efforts will be successful. Poor, minority, and disabled voters will have to make extraordinary efforts to be vigilant and prepare to vote in 2012, because otherwise Republicans will have succeeded in disenfranchising them, suppressing their votes and voices, and deciding the election before a single ballot is cast.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has become a virtual tautology to say that the nation’s long-term fiscal problem is really a health care cost problem. But the unfortunate reality, so we are told, is that no one—no insurer, no state—has cracked the code on bringing health care costs under control.
That is, except a team of researchers at Dartmouth Medical School who publish the Dartmouth Atlas, a research project that has shown definitively that the growth in health care costs could be arrested if all health-care providers were to simply bring their spending in line with that of low-cost providers. The Dartmouth researchers have even found that patients who receive more care—through more frequent tests, procedures, and hospitalizations—have health care outcomes that are either no different or worse than those who are treated at places with lower costs.
Yet if one thing is known about Harvard Medical School’s two largest affiliates hospitals—Mass General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, both owned by Partners HealthCare—it is that they are the poster children of the sort of fragmented and wasteful care that explains much of the rise in health care costs. For years, Partners had a sweetheart, handshake agreement with the commonwealth’s largest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, to pay substantially higher reimbursements than other providers for performing the exact same treatments, according to a Boston Globe investigation.
It should be little surprise then that Partners hospitals have been consistently singled out by the Dartmouth researchers as cost villains. But until recently, it was scarcely known just how far Partners executives had gone to protect the status quo.
As former Wall Street Journal reporter Ron Suskind reports in his new book, “Confidence Men,” one of Dartmouth’s experts, James N. Weinstein, was invited by the White House to draft a section of the health care bill mandating comparative effectiveness analysis based on Dartmouth’s data. The proposal, however, was blocked by Senator John F. Kerry “under pressure from Harvard's noted medical centers, so aggrieved were they at how Dartmouth's effectiveness data had revealed flaws, inefficiencies, and unnecessary treatments even at the world's most noted hospitals.” The result is that Dartmouth’s name appears nowhere in the health care bill.
As Massachusetts’—and perhaps the country’s—preeminent center of medical education, HMS ought to expect its principal affiliates to be at the forefront of cost control, not using their influence to block important reforms. When he was appointed to his deanship four years ago, HMS Dean Jeffrey S. Flier told The Crimson that Harvard should be “forcefully engaged” in national discussions about health care reform, as it was a “complicated subject” where Harvard’s expertise could play an important role. And while some HMS professors—notably Atul Gawande, author of the debate-shifting New Yorker article explicating the Dartmouth data, and Donald M. Berwick ’68, the director of Medicare and Medicaid and a pediatrician who specializes in evidence-based medicine—have made enormous contributions to tackling this issue, HMS should use its clout and prestige to ensure that the Partners hospitals too are leaders rather than laggards.
Because, as Gawande made clear at his HMS Class Day address last spring, the stakes are simply too high. In his speech, Gawande recounted a conversation he had with superintendent of his children’s school district in Newton, Mass, which recently cut his children’s art class.
“You know what I spend my time working on?” the superintendent asked. “Health-care costs.” With the district’s health costs up 9 percent and revenues flat, program cuts were his only alternative.
That we’ve reached the day when health spending has crowded out arts programs for children is sad and portends an even dimmer future for this country if nothing changes. Tackling this challenge, an existential economic threat to this country if there ever were one, is something worthy of Harvard’s best minds. But lest Harvard forget, there is no better way to lead than by example.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten years ago, when Seema T. Meloni was studying biological sciences in public health at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, a Chinese restaurant occupied space in one of the units of a complex on Tremont Street.
Today, the Chinese restaurant Meloni recalls is one of the satellite facilities of the Harvard School of Public Health, where Meloni now works in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases.
The converted Chinese restaurant is one of twenty-nine separate buildings, dispersed throughout Longwood and Boston, that house the growing School of Public Health. The University owns only four of these facilities, forced to rent out the others for additional space.
“It’s clear that one of the biggest constraints [for us] is space,” says Julio Frenk, dean of the School of Public Health, who described his School’s facilities as “landlocked.”
“As we look into the future, we need to grow,” he says.
For almost ten years, administrators have said that these buildings are too cramped and dispersed to meet the School of Public Health’s growing needs. But despite their efforts, the School has not been granted a unified space.
With the recent approval of the Harvard Allston Work Team’s recommendations for Allston, the School of Public Health may now have a renewed hope for moving to the site of the formerly-planned Allston Science Complex.
THE RECOMMENDATION
In September, the University approved the Work Team’s five recommendations for Harvard’s advancements into Allston. The Work Team—a 14-person group of deans, faculty, and alumni commissioned by University President Drew G. Faust—called for Harvard to reconsider space constraints facing the School of Public Health.
In the past, Allston was considered a possible solution for the School. For that reason, one of the recommendations calls for Harvard to resume planning and developing the Science Complex while accommodating the “programmatic needs” of the School of Public Health.
It also states that the new facility should be redesigned to maximize space for science programming while taking into consideration the University’s global health initiatives.
University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp says that Harvard’s new provost, Alan M. Garber ’76, is in the process of reviewing the University’s academic needs, with an eye towards development in Allston.
“This review builds upon the Work Team discussions resulting in the recommendations released in June that involved participation by several deans, including the Dean of the School of Public Health, and leaders across the University,” Lapp wrote in a statement. “This academic planning, along with a sound financial strategy, provides the kind of discipline we need to make sure that if we start a project we will finish it.”
Currently, Garber is in the midst of prioritizing the University’s academic needs in Allston. Since the halt in construction on the Allston Science Complex in Dec. 2009, Harvard has directed its attention toward building an Enterprise Research Campus for science on Allston Landing North, similar to MIT’s Kendall Square.
THE HISTORY
The School of Public Health has seen significant growth in the past decade. Since 2001, the School has added 274 faculty and staff and increased enrollment by 236 students.
In 2003 the School developed a master plan that outlined two possibilities that would meet its growing needs.
One was for the School of Public Health to build an entirely new campus in Allston while maintaining its relatively new 105,000 square foot Francois-Xavier Bagnoud building on Huntington Ave. as a connection between Longwood and Allston. State-of-the-art facilities costing $560 million would replace worn down buildings built in the 1960s and 1970s and provide a permanent solution to the campus’ space limitations.
During this time, “we worked very hard to do planning for what it would mean for the school were it to have been moved,” says former Dean of the School of Public Health Barry R. Bloom, whose tenure ran from 1999 until 2009.
With a move at that time seemingly imminent, Bloom says that some of the faculty members were “delighted” and some were “disappointed.”
But due to financial constraints, in Dec. 2009 the University indefinitely halted construction on the Allston Science Complex, and along with it any plans for unifying and updating the School of Public Health.
Two years later, with talk of the University’s next steps into Allston back on the table, some officials say they hope the School will finally be given a unified space.
“I would hope that if current deans are engaged in planning, there would be a much more serious intent to create fruitful results,” says Bloom.
TO MOVE OR NOT TO MOVE?
Just as when Bloom was dean, those who work at the School of Public Health are divided on the possibility of moving to Allston.
Professor of Environmental Epidemiology Douglas W. Dockery says that relocating would create “stronger ties to the College and the rest of the University.”
“We haven’t been able to partner with the other school here as effectively as we should because of the distance,” he says.
Bloom—who will be co-teaching a College course, Life Sciences 120: “Global Health Threats,” this spring—says that moving the School near the College would be beneficial because he sees a “tremendous” interest in global health there.
“I think it would be a lot easier for [undergraduates] to have an outlet they can walk to in Allston instead of having to take the M2 shuttle,” he says, adding that a move would also enhance the College’s existing facilities.
“We have an extraordinary sense of community all over the place, even with faculty as far away as the Sears Center, but that could only be enhanced if we worked together on a daily basis,” Bloom says.
But moving into Allston is not without its complications. The School of Public Health has had a presence in Longwood since 1913 and its own building in the area since 1923, a history that faculty members say complicates the possibility of moving.
Dockery says that, over the years, the School of Public Health has also developed “very strong connections” with the neighboring Medical School.
“I think we’re torn,” he says.
Professor Alberto Ascherio expressed a similar opinion in an email.
“Because of our close connections with the Harvard Medical School, I would prefer to remain in the medical area,” Ascherio wrote.
Professor of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics John Quackenbush says that moving the campus to Allston might be a disadvantage to those who have appointments in the Medical School and could reduce the amount of time faculty members spend in the department.
“I understand all the constraints and the reasons why you might want to move out there,” Quackenbush says. “I know that our department is really tight and constrained to space, but I don’t think that’s unique to our department or to the School of Public Health.”
Bloom says that academic concerns outweigh spacial considerations and that if the move were to happen it would have to fit the School’s overall development and academic missions.
“You can build a building anywhere but it doesn’t make an intellectual community,” says Bloom.
He says that when he was considering the move before the onset of the financial crisis, he was hesitant. He worried that relocating to Allston would have meant losing access to “a third or half of my faculty,” who he says would have been resistant to the move and remained in Boston.
Regardless of whether the School moves to Allston, Frenk says that the School plans to always keep “a strong, major presence in Longwood.”
“It’s a complicated move,” Bloom said. “It isn’t just packing up.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: NOV. 7, 2011
The Nov. 7 article "School of Public Health Looks to Expand in Allston" incorrectly stated that a potential relocation by the School of Public Health to Allston would involve a move across the Charles River. In fact, Allston and the School of Public Health are located on the same side of the Charles.

Following an increased effort on the part of the College to discourage students from engaging in dangerous drinking practices, the Office of Student Life has allocated an additional $3500 to each of the 12 residential Houses to support “alternative programming” on weekend nights.
The College is in the process of reviewing its current drinking guidelines, with the goal of drafting a new alcohol policy by the end of this academic year.
The money was given to the Houses as a “new, experimental effort to support alcohol-free programs over the course of the academic year,” Assistant Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich wrote in an email, adding that the OSL intends for the money to be spent on weekend activities “with a focus on weekend nights”—though the Houses have final say on the way in which the money is spent.
“I think the purpose of it was to provide alternatives to going out to the final clubs and drinking your brains out,” Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67. “We’re happy to try to do that.”
He added that although he saw merit in the OSL’s focus on nighttime events, he thought restricting the money to late-night activities was “not particularly conducive to the long term.” Palfrey said that he planned to loosely interpret the OSL’s instructions to include activities with “any vague connection” to discouraging alcohol consumption. So far, Adams has used a portion of the money for a Saturday morning apple-picking excursion earlier this fall.
“Anyone who wanted to go is unlikely to have stayed up and gotten totally drunk the night before,” Palfrey said.
Other Houses have used the OSL funds for a variety of activities, ranging from square dancing to movie nights to pumpkin carving. Cabot House, for example, held an outdoor movie night and provided food on weekend nights for hungry Quad residents in search of late night snacks.
Cabot House Master Stephanie R. Khurana said that the House is testing a number of different activities and soliciting student feedback before it decides how to spend the rest of the money.
“We’re just trying to figure out where we can make the biggest impact,” Khurana said.
Friedrich wrote that the College plans to evaluate the success of the program at the end of the year to determine if it will provide similar funding in the future.
The encouragement of alternative late night activities is the latest in a College-wide effort to address dangerous drinking habits among Harvard undergraduates.
Last semester, Houses began designating “responsible adults” to serve drinks at House events. Around the same time, the College mandated that only beer and wine—not hard alcohol—could be served at off-campus formals that semester.
But changes during the spring semester represent a temporary fix to what administrators perceive to be a larger problem. To address this, Harvard formed a committee last year to review the College’s standing rules on alcohol, which will continue to meet this year and submit a proposal for a new alcohol policy to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds by the end of the spring semester.

A Harvard Law School internal investigation concluded that the majority of complaints made by Law School custodians in September—which included claims of language discrimination and excessive workload—could not be “substantiated.”
In a statement reporting the findings, which the University sent to union representatives, the Law School additionally agreed to meet with workers to clarify rules and procedures, and assured them that custodians will not be required to improve their English.
While representatives for the custodians said they are happy with the Law School’s push to clarify procedure, they said that there are still points of contention between the Law School and the custodians. In particular, union members said they stand by the charges of administrator misconduct and excessive custodial workload alleged in the September letter.
“We still believe there was inappropriate behavior by the second shift supervisor,” said Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for the Service Employees International Union Local 615, the union which represents custodial workers. According to Langley, the administrator raised her fist in the air and shook it menacingly at workers.
Langley also said he believed the University’s investigation—which the statement said took into account multiple eye-witness accounts—was not “thorough.”
“There were three witnesses, and they took the word of one. Why would they do that? That isn’t acceptable—it doesn’t cut the mustard,” Langley said.
“The overwhelming weight of the evidence established that the supervisor only raised an issue about one particular incident involving a [single] custodian,” read the University statement. “The supervisor in question also recommended one of the custodians who raised this complaint for promotion.”
The statement also indicated that the University found that custodians’ complaints about an unfair workload were unfounded.
“There is no indication that supervisors will ‘follow’ FMO custodians in the future or that workloads are so prohibitively heavy as to prevent the taking of breaks,” the statement reads.
However, Langley said that Harvard’s findings on this issue were “highly misguided.”
“Workers are saying that there is so much work that they have to work through their breaks and lunch because they are afraid they won’t finish it all,” Langley said. “[The University is] saying that there is no proof, but this is not something that workers would just make up.”
Langley added that the Law School did not adequately address the issue of unjustified transfers, though it did substantiate the claim that two transfers had been made “without providing explanation.”
Both parties called for continued dialogue on the issues. Langley said further discussions will be necessary for Harvard and the union to come to an agreement.
“We are hoping to resolve this very soon,” said Langley. “The sooner we finish this, the sooner we can move on.”

The Henry Adams Club, a history graduate student organization, awarded GSAS alumnus Oscar Handlin a posthumous honorary Vice President’s post on Friday, over 70 years after he was denied the position for being Jewish.
Handlin taught history at Harvard for over 50 years and won a Pulitzer Prize for his book “The Uprooted,” a chronicle of migrations that shaped the United States.
Shaun S. Nichols, current Vice President of the Henry Adams Club, said he learned of the incident while reading a memoir by Handlin’s classmate Joseph Hope Franklin.
“[Handlin] was nominated, and basically someone said, ‘He may be a good Jew, but he’s still a Jew,’” Nichols said.
“I usually hold these symbolic events in low esteem,” said Nichols, who opened the ceremony on Friday. But he said this event was “a testament that historians really do change the world.”
The organization unanimously approved club President Gregory D. Afinogenov’s motion to confer the title.
“What this shows is that I can be President of Henry Adams without even thinking that I’m Jewish,” said Afinogenov, who comes from a Russian-Jewish background similar to Handlin’s. “This kind of event is good at marking out how much had changed.”
Handlin’s daughter Joanna accepted the award on her father’s behalf, although she said she felt the incident had not impacted her father greatly.
“One thing that amazes me is that never did I ever hear my father mention anti-Semitism, or even mention the Adams Club for that matter,” she said.
Professor Bernard Bailyn, a colleague of Handlin’s for many years, agreed that being Jewish was not a defining characteristic of Handlin’s career at Harvard. He recalled Handlin’s close collaboration with other professors such as Samuel E. Morrison—who Bailyn described as “a Brahmin of the Brahmins.”
“They merged in the work they were doing together at the history department,” Bailyn said.
Handlin’s daughter said she was initially skeptical about whether her father would approve of such an honor.
“We all knew my father as someone who did not believe that the wrongs of history could or should be righted many decades later,” she said.
“[This] in itself is a historical artifact of this day and age, and that is a good thing,” she added.
“I can almost hear him saying, ‘Thanks, now go do your writing.’”

Longtime Harvard Business School sociology professor and leader in the field of organizational behavior Paul R. Lawrence died last week of prostate cancer at a retirement community in Bedford, Mass, according to a HBS press release. He was 89.
Lawrence’s research on organizational change and design legitimized the field as being “worthy of study at a business school,” HBS professor Michael L. Tushman said. Tushman currently holds the Paul R. Lawrence Professorship, a chair position named in Lawrence’s honor in 1999.
“With a remarkable lifelong intensity about his research, he never let up in his quest for understanding organizations in our society,” Tushman said.
Lawrence received his MBA degree at HBS in 1947 along with a doctorate in commercial science in 1950, according to the press release.
In the following decades, Lawrence shed light on organizational issues such as race relations and urban governance, health care, and the management of research and development.
He was known not only for this research, but also for his prolific authorship of books and articles. In 1967, Lawrence coauthored “Organization and Environment: Managing Differentiation and Integration.” The work, which was named the best management book of the year and has been cited over 2,000 times in journals, challenged the conventional idea that there is a single recipe for organizational effectiveness.
In addition to his research, Lawrence taught first-year MBA classes for 18 consecutive years and participated on some 60 dissertation committees for Harvard doctoral candidates, according to the press release.
“Paul Lawrence’s legacy comprises not only his seminal writing and the large number of students he advised and guided to their doctorates, but a fundamentally different way of thinking about what constitutes good management research,” Ranjay Gulati, head of the organizational behavior unit at HBS, said in the press release. “He believed it was the responsibility of researchers to shed light on the management issues of the time.”
Even when he was well into his eighties, Lawrence strove to develop a new unified theory of human behavior.
“Dad was intensely curious,” his daughter Anne T. Lawrence said in the press release. “He saw himself as a synthesizer, someone who could draw on many fields to craft a fresh way of looking at the world.”
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria called Lawrence an “extraordinary person in all facets of his life.”
“Paul will long be remembered as a giant in the history of Harvard Business School,” Nohria said in the press release. “He will be greatly missed by all of us who had the privilege of knowing and learning from him,”
A memorial service will be held Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. in the Story Chapel at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.

As tensions have erupted and tempers have flared over Harvard’s expansion into Allston, Ray V. Mellone, chair of the Harvard Allston Task Force, has played the role of wizened negotiator during numerous community meetings. In recognition of Mellone’s service to the community, the City of Boston renamed the newly-created Library Park after him on Saturday.
“It’s surreal,” Mellone said of the honor. “It’s nothing I ever anticipated, I couldn’t talk [the city] out of it.”
During the hour-long ceremony, city officials and neighbors lauded Mellone for his dedication.
“Too often we name these parks after people who have passed,” Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said at the dedication ceremony. “I am glad that future generations will forever know how much we respected you for making this community what it is today.”
Mellone, an 83 year-old Allston native, has contributed to the community in a variety of ways over the past 60 years, working as a Boston city planner for Boston, a former President of the Board of Directors for the Vocational Advancement Center, and a leader of the local Boy Scout Troop 5.
“Many of the hats Ray has worn, you don’t get paid,” said Boston City Councillor At-Large John Connolly. “You do it because you love the neighborhood. That’s the kind of guy Ray is.”
The park—which will now be called the Raymond V. Mellone Park—opened in July and was built behind the Honan-Allston Library on land that Harvard donated to the City.
The University also funded its construction in part.
Transforming this land from a vacant industrial lot to a lush green space is part of Harvard’s continued efforts to ameliorate the effects of pausing its development in Allston.
In Dec. 2009, Harvard halted construction on the Allston Science Complex—which had been touted as a $1 billion mecca for science research that would bring thousands of jobs to the neighborhood—much to the dismay of community members.
Since then, Harvard-Allston Task Force meetings have seen many tense exchanges between the University and local community, which Mellone has presided over with a level head, according to community members who attended the event.
“He wants to find a middle ground that benefits this community and Harvard,” said Mellon’s son Michael, referring to the Task Force meetings that his father has headed. “His dedication to his community is a sincere one.”
Paul Berkeley, president of the Allston Civic Association, said that Mellone’s foresight has served the community well as it has interacted with Allston.
Scott Matalon, president of the Allston Board of Trade, expressed a similar sentiment.
“It’s nice to see the community recognize individuals who work quietly without a lot of yelling and screaming and who just care,” Matalon said.
Mellone said that he is optimistic that the University and Allston community can work together more productively in the future.
“We just have to get Harvard and the community to assimilate with each other in a way that’s beneficial for both of them,” he said, stressing the need for both the University and the community to “grow together.”
But for Mellone, the park exemplifies the beneficial effects of Harvard’s involvement in Allston, and he said he hopes to spend his time there with his wife enjoying good weather and reading books.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 20 students Sunday night launched “Occupy the Facts,” a nascent student organization hoping to combat charges that protestors in the Occupy movement are uninformed about public policy issues.
The organization seeks to conduct important policy research and make their findings accessible to Occupy protesters and the public. The group will spend the next three weeks developing information packages.
“I want to see if we [can] create something that could research public policy surrounding the occupiers’ demands,” said Peter D. Davis ’12, one of the project facilitators. “We want to be able to create fact sheets.”
One of the projects’ goals is to eventually transform their policy findings into various formats, including educational YouTube videos and info-graphics.
Davis said that the inspiration for “Occupy the Facts” is the potential for Occupy to affect social change.
“I see the Occupy movement as a platform that might just have a chance at making the kind of change that a lot of people in our generation have been dreaming of,” Davis said.
Talia B. Lavin ’12, another active student participant, protested the criticism levied against the movement.
“I’ve noticed this persistent criticism that the demands of the movement aren’t specific enough,” Talia B. Lavin ’12 said. “The goal is to reach out to people who have heard a lot about Occupy but aren’t sure what Occupy is trying to achieve.”
Davis believes the charges that Occupy participants are uninformed are distracting from the movement’s potential.
“This group is calling those peoples’ bluffs,” Davis said.
Davis met with a small group last week to determine how they could help the Occupy movement. They came to the conclusion that they could leverage Harvard’s research resources to make policy information more accessible and conclusive.
“Occupy is not a closed movement—it’s an open platform. It’s not something that you have to remain a spectator of,” Davis said. “We can get involved.”
Sunday’s meeting included Harvard students ranging from first-years to a Ph.D candidate.
According to Davis, the organization hopes to draw from the “comparative advantage of Harvard students.”
“We have access to a lot of research resources,” he said. “We have access to professors, who are knowledgeable about these issues, and we have an amazing library system.”
The group has yet to begin research, but it has already established a framework of research practices meant to provide guidance moving forward.
These policies include sourcing every fact included in published material and maintaining a neutral research approach.
Although many of the participants are sympathetic to the Occupy movement, Lavin stresses the group’s mission to remain as neutral and objective as possible—which might mean publishing results that may not be taken favorably by Occupy supporters.
“We want to release objective, clear, independent public policy research. Not serving as propaganda for Occupy Boston, but non-biased informational materials,” Lavin said.

Highlighting the inherent connection between the land and the religions of India, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies Diana L. Eck lectured Sunday on India’s spiritual landscape—the topic of her upcoming book.
Eck described India as a “living landscape,” linking mountains, forests, and rivers with various stories of gods and religious heroes.
Thirty years in the making, Eck’s book, titled “India: A Sacred Geography,” also details the many pilgrimage locations and routes that decorate India’s vast territory, shaping both regional and national identity.
“The entire land of India is a great network of pilgrimage places,” Eck said, noting the importance of Banaras, India’s greatest pilgrimage location and the topic of one of her previous books, “Banaras, City of Light.”
Eck, who first experienced India during a study abroad program as an undergraduate at Smith College, has continued to explore Indian studies through religion, specializing in studies of Hinduism.
Eck said the process of writing “Banaras, City of Light” prompted the idea for her current book, which was started in the 1980s and will be published this spring.
“[This book] taught me most of what I know about Hinduism,” Eck said. “This is a work that I can feel proud of, but mostly humble about.”
Audience members said they agreed with Eck’s characterization of India’s relationship with its religion.
"During my gap year in India, I found the common representation of geopolitical India as a goddess quite fascinating," said Nishin Nathwani ’15, who attended the lecture.
The talk was part of an ongoing series of public outreach lectures hosted by the South Asian Studies Department, which will continue through the month of November.
“We did this to see if we could get the scholarship of Sanskrit studies to the public,” said Outreach Coordinator Bijoy M. Misra said.
The initiative is a “journey in promoting India as a whole,” he added.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: NOV. 13, 2011
The Nov. 7 article "Prof. Eck Discusses New Book on India" misquoted Nishin Nathwani '15 when speaking about his religious beliefs.

In September 1980, a young woman named Minka Y. vanBeuzekom moved into the Kendall Square neighborhood. Now, armed with the experience that comes with raising two daughters, developing a long history of community involvement, and spending 31 years in Cambridge, she is running for Cambridge City Council.
VanBeuzekom is not new to campaigning. She ran for Cambridge City Council in 2009 and lost. This time, she is taking the lessons learned from her first campaign and building on them. For one, she has jump-started her social media presence, logging 1,907 tweets as of Saturday under the handle @MinkavB.
“The first time is the hardest,” she says. “There’s so much that’s different. I have much more of a step-by-step plan about how to proceed, with time tables built in.”
This plan includes careful campaign planning and targeted, timed mailings, such as the letter to biotech companies in Cambridge that volunteers gathered in vanBeuzekom’s home were stuffing into envelopes a few weeks ago. While vanBeuzekom talked to the Crimson in the kitchen, the volunteers realized that a number of envelopes had been addressed upside down. The candidate was not concerned.
“That’s the human touch,” she called out from the next room, adding, “I don’t think they need to redo them all.”
She does not fit the profile of your average politician. A Molecular Biology major with a Masters in Public Health, Environmental Health, and Epidemiology, much of her in background is in the sciences. She has worked as a researcher for both Harvard University and MIT, studying neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s. In her years as a Cambridge resident, environmental and sustainability issues have always been a focus.
Her eclectic resume includes time spent on the Cambridge Democratic City Committee and the Area Four Neighborhood Coalition, but also the Home Energy Efficiency Team, Green Decade Cambridge. She also is a self-professed gardening and rat-trapping enthusiast.
“Everything that I do is pretty much through an environmental prism,” vanBeuzekom says. “It’s community, it’s air quality, it’s water quality, it’s food, it’s energy consumption, whether it’s renewable energy—everything fits under that banner.”
However, vanBeuzekom traces the roots of her community involvement back to her two daughters. In early 1990, as her eldest daughter was set to enter kindergarten in September, vanBeuzekom and her ex-husband discovered that they had not been granted any of the top five school choices that they had picked under Cambridge’s controlled choice enrollment system. They were not the only parents they knew of in this situation, and so a group of frustrated families decided they start their own school: The Cambridgeport School.
“I don’t remember how, but we ended up finding each other, and working together to petition the school board, to say, well clearly, there’s something lacking,” says vanBeuzekom. “You have all these parents that don’t have a school for their kids, and you know, you have under schools that have under-enrollment. So, let’s get another school going.”
They began with one kindergarten classroom, taught by Mary E. Cronin in space at the Morse School. VanBeuzekom’s daughter was among the first students. The next fall, the school increased to kindergarten through second grade, and the School Committee leased space for the venture at the Sacred Heart School.
Today, the school has expanded to grades K through eight, with an enrollment of about 300. She is no longer involved with its management, although she recalls those “chaotic” early years fondly.
“When it was first starting out, oh my gosh, we just did so much,” she says. “We went through those stacks of resumes for the teachers, we helped shape the curriculum, we picked out the principal.”
VanBeuzekom sees that intense parental involvement as a key factor in building a strong school community. The City Council’s involvement in the school system is limited by its finances, but still vanBeuzekom points to Cambridge’s schools as a potential area for community improvement.
“Cambridge is an absolutely incredible place. We are so wealthy in terms of money and intellectual capital—Harvard and MIT. We are an incredibly lucky place to have all that coming together,” van Beuzekom says. “The schools are the single black eye, I think.”
Meanwhile, that kindergarten class vanBeuzekom helped bring together 21 Septembers ago has returned to help her. One of the then five and six year old students in that first class, Ian H. Carlson, is now the treasurer on her campaign.
“When I first knew her, it was just as a very warm, caring person, as a parent to me and to the class at the Cambridgeport school,” Carlson says. “When I met her again ... I guess I would say she just comes off as a pretty motivated and principled person, and a fresh voice for the City Council.”

At 31, Matt P. Nelson is the youngest candidate in this year’s Cambridge City Council election. Though he lacks the years of experience of many of the current City Councilors, he hopes his energy and innovation will land him a seat on the Council.
Nelson strongly believes that City Councilors should boost civic participation through grassroots and community-based organizing.
“I represent a lot of constituencies that aren’t fully represented right now in the City Council,” Nelson says.
Nelson has been active in local politics in Cambridge and other parts of Massachusetts for years, though until his current bid, much of his work had been for other candidates.
“For the last seven years I’ve dedicated my life to progressive campaigns,” Nelson said in an interview with Cambridge Community Television in September.
Nelson has been actively involved a variety of liberal causes, including environmentalism, healthcare reform, and union advocacy. On his Facebook page, Nelson publicly supports the union strikes and other labor issues in Wisconsin.
Nelson is also committed to affordable healthcare and housing in Cambridge, and he has criticized the rising cost of living in Cambridge in recent years.
“We need to ensure that Cambridge natives can live in their hometown if they so choose,” Nelson said in a video of his campaign kickoff at local eatery Atwood’s Tavern posted on his campaign website.
While his youth might suggest that he has little professional experience as a politician, Nelson has in fact been a part of many grassroots initiatives and has a history of community organizing.
He was previously the state director of Healthcare United Virginia, a project of the Service Employees International Union.
“I had a staff of about 15 union leaders from all over America, all older than me, and I was their manager,” Nelson says.
Nelson believes that his experience working with diverse groups on communal goals will be one of his strongest selling points come election day.
“The experience really taught me a lot about how to deal with a diverse group of people, and how to use their skills to have positive outcomes,” Nelson says.
Other notable items in Nelson’s professional history include coordinating the Massachusetts Environmental Voters Education Fund in 2010 and managing a previous campaign for Cambridge City Councilor Henrietta Davis.
Nelson, a Cambridge native and a graduate of Cambridge Public Schools, has lived in the area for most of his life.
One of Nelson’s earliest experiences as a political organizer came from his time as a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, where, as a sophomore in high school, he helped plan a protest against school budget cuts and teacher layoffs.
Nelson, who is a graduate of the University of Arizona and recently received his Masters in Public Administration from Suffolk University, says he is particularly interested in Cambridge youth and educational programming.
Nelson has worked as a teacher in Cambridge Public Schools summer programs, and says he wants to assemble an alliance of local non-profit organizations that all target underprivileged children in Cambridge.
“I want to set up an umbrella organization of nonprofits to help kids who need it most,” says Nelson, adding that he hopes to accomplish this by leveraging the City’s business assets and local universities.
As a newcomer to running for elected office, Nelson’s main campaign technique has been going door-to-door, and talking with Cambridge residents about the issues that concern them most.
And come election day, the politically precocious Cambridge native is hoping that his energy and devotion to those issues will be enough for him to win a position on the Council.
When asked what defines Cambridge for him, Nelson cited the City’s impressive diversity, in everything from ethnic restaurants to economic strata.
“In terms of diversity, Cambridge is one of a kind,” Nelson says.

Cambridge City Councilor Sam Seidel, known for his congenial personality and hands-on approach with his constituents, has once again harnessed his passions for urban planning and education in his bid for his third term on the City Council.
“I think I’ve shown myself to be a good, conscientious, hard working City Councilor who is focusing on the issues that impact people’s lives,” says Seidel, who holds weekly office hours for Cambridge residents to drop by to discuss complaints and community initiatives. “That is how to do my job.”
But his path into local politics has not been a straightforward one.
During his first foray into the Cambridge political scene, Seidel lost his bid for the City Council by 90 votes in 2005. But Seidel, undeterred, rallied to win a seat in 2007 after a hard-fought campaign that tapped into his interest in urban planning. Seidel—who received a masters in urban planning from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2001—focused his platform on lowering housing costs, addressing increasing gentrification, and bringing an environmentalist’s eye to urban growth.
“I wanted to serve in my community in a public capacity, and I came with a background in urban planning,” he says. “Urban planners think about cities and how they work.”
Seidel—who currently chairs the City Council’s Ordinance Committee and the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning Committee—has previously worked as a consulting planner, and says he still “spends a lot of time thinking about how the city grows.”
Seidel has centered his current campaign around early education, sustainable transportation, and urban development in growing Cambridge neighborhoods, such as Kendall Square.
“These issues can include housing, open space, recreation, transportation, and economic development,” he says. “You pretty much can be thinking about any one of them or all of them at any given point in time.”
Seidel says early education is a particularly important priority for him.
“People are having a [more] enriching time at school ... and the out of school experience is equally meaningful and enriching for them. The next piece of that is going to be early childhood education,” says Seidel, who is a former board president of the Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House, the oldest settlement house in the United States that now serves as a community center near Central Square.
Apart from education and urban planning and development, Seidel says he considers the environment to be the “biggest, [most] important topic in society.”
If reelected, Seidel says he will focus on promoting the use of bicycles as an as an alternative form of transportation in Cambridge.
And Seidel’s passion has not gone unnoticed by peers, who remark on his amicable approach to tackling the big issues.
Leland Cheung, who is currently serving his first term on the Council, says he thinks of Seidel as a “good colleague and friend.”
Seidel’s aide Victoria Harris agrees.
“I think he focused on certain issues and really worked hard at them. I think he tried to work in a very collegial manner,” says Harris, noting his work with the Blue Ribbon Commission, which dealt with middle school students and after-school programming.
Seidel—an avid bicyclist who enjoys reading, the arts, history, and the outdoors—lives in mid-Cambridge with his wife, Ann, and his dog, Gus—a mutt who is “a mix of something and something,” he says.
Though Seidel certainly has many interests, he always comes back to his background in urban planning, which he credits with his ability to see “what the issue is today but also what the future is down the road.”
But ultimately, it is his passion for political work that drives him.
“I love the work and approach it with enjoyment,” he said.

UPDATE: 3:30 a.m. November 8, 2011.
The Phi Beta Kappa chapter at Harvard College, Alpha-Iota of Massachusetts, selected its “Senior 48” members of the Class of 2012 last week, and released all of the names today, according to Chapter President Logan S. McCarty ’96.
This selection is the second of three rounds, beginning with the “Junior 24” elected last spring and concluding with a final group selected right before Commencement. All together, the three groups comprise about 10 percent of the senior class each year.
McCarty, who is Director of Physical Sciences Education and was a PBK honoree himself, said that students elected to the chapter must demonstrate excellence in the breadth and depth of their undergraduate studies.
“I think in some sense the most interesting thing about the process is that in the end we don’t make selections solely on the basis of GPA,” he said. “We want to choose students who have a rigorous academic record—in other words, students who have chosen to take more challenging courses, courses outside of their concentration, when those are available.”
Yannis Kalogirou Valtis ’12 said that he tried to take as many courses that are “particular to the Harvard scientific community—classes that I couldn’t take at other places” and focused on learning from professors who were prominent in their scientific fields. Though he is a Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator, he said that one of his favorite courses among those he has taken was PHIL 144: Logic and Philosophy, which analyzes the philosophy of mathematical concepts. It was rated as difficult or very difficult by 80 percent of the students, who are mostly math or physics concentrators.
However, Kalogirou Valtis said that he didn’t mind the late nights spent completing problem sets because he was interested in the topic.
“I think that was a very powerful moment for me, realizing that rigorous mathematical discussions and considerations could have very concrete philosophical applications,” he said.
According to the PBK chapter website, elected students are chosen from within the fields of social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities.
Colin Teo ’12 focuses on both natural sciences and humanities as a Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrator who is also pursuing a film studies secondary. He says that both subjects interest him equally, but says that photography is a stress-relieving hobby.
“When I bring my camera around and take photographs, I really lose myself in it,” said Teo, who also runs the fashion blog “Books and Liquor.”
Selection criteria differ from chapter to chapter; at Harvard, prospective inductees are initially chosen based on their GPAs. Students then submit letters of recommendation for review by Chapter Officers, the head tutors from the concentrations of students under consideration, and current PBK Chapter undergraduates who then decide on the next group of inductees.
The elected students will be honored at a ceremony after Thanksgiving in Currier House, where Currier House Master and Human Evolutionary Biology Professor Richard W. Wrangham will deliver an address, McCarty said.
Though selecting honorees from a pool of such accomplished students is challenging, McCarty said he appreciates the chance to get to know students more fully through the PBK election process.
“It’s certainly interesting to see students who I know, who I’ve had in class but who I often only see in one dimension,” he said.  “They’re very inspiring students. I often look at the transcripts and say, ‘how do the students do all these things?’”
Harvard’s chapter, which was formed in 1781, is the oldest continuous chapter in the country. It includes alumni such as Facebook Chief Opperating Officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, “The Office” producer Michael H. Schur ’97, and Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard dropout and Facebook founder Mark E. Zuckerberg addressed Facebook’s future and the potential for a Facebook office in Boston at a packed press conference outside Lamont Library Monday afternoon.
“Oh, we’re just getting started,” Zuckerberg said enthusiastically when asked what Facebook still had to accomplish.
“The original goals for the company are to make it so that the whole world can be more open and connected. And you know the last five years have really just been about helping people get signed up and stay connected with their friends,” he added. “But I think the next five or ten years are going to be about all of these different products and industries that can be rethought.”
Citing recent developments in social games, music, and television on Facebook, Zuckerberg explained that Facebook will provide a platform through which “different industries can be rethought in different ways so that your friends are there with you.”
In response to a question about why Facebook had not followed in the footsteps of Microsoft and Google and opened a Boston office, Zuckerberg remained hopeful but confirmed that there are no plans in the near future to do so.
Facebook has opened one development office outside of Palo Alto, Calif. in Seattle, Wash., according to Zuckerberg, in large part because it is in the same time zone and is easily accessible.
“We want to really get the culture there right before we start opening up other offices, but at some point hopefully down the line we will do that,” he said.
Zuckerberg emerged from the Loeb House, where he was meeting with University President Drew G. Faust, at 4:30 p.m. and answered three questions from the press before going directly to an exclusive discussion at Farkas Hall (formerly New College Theatre) with 200 students.
Students applied in advance to take part in the discussion—moderated by Computer Science Senior Lecturer David J. Malan ’99—through the Office of Career Services, and about 200 students were accepted based on their resumés.
Some students who did not receive tickets were placed on a waiting list, and all students from the standby list who showed up prior to the event were accommodated, according to Kevin Galvin, Director of News and Media Relations at the University.
Zuckerberg’s visit to Harvard is part of a three-university recruiting trip along the East Coast that includes MIT and Carnegie Mellon University.
“There’s a lot of really smart people here,” Zuckerberg answered when asked why he chose to recruit at Harvard and MIT. “And a lot of them are making decisions about where they’re going to work when they graduate in the next couple of weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATE: 3:30 a.m. November 8, 2011
Harvard dropout and Facebook founder Mark E. Zuckerberg addressed Facebook’s future and the potential for a Facebook office in Boston at a packed press conference outside Lamont Library Monday afternoon.
However, students who attended an exclusive discussion with Zuckerberg in Farkas Hall (formerly New College Theatre) after the press appearance said they were most taken by the fact that Zuckerberg, whose accomplishments and reputation have shrouded him in myth, suddenly seemed “human.”
Clad in jeans and a navy hoodie, the social network guru bumped fists with an excited student to the cheers and the frantic clicking of cameras after emerging at 4:30 p.m. from a meeting with University President Drew G. Faust in Loeb House.
Surrounded by the press on one side and a crowd of students armed with cameras and iPhones on the other, Zuckerberg kept a smile on his face throughout the three-minute press conference.
“Oh, we’re just getting started,” Zuckerberg said enthusiastically when asked what Facebook still had to accomplish.
“The original goals for the company are to make it so that the whole world can be more open and connected. And you know the last five years have really just been about helping people get signed up and stay connected with their friends,” he added. “But I think the next five or ten years are going to be about all of these different products and industries that can be rethought.”
Citing recent developments in social games, music, and television on Facebook, Zuckerberg explained that Facebook would provide a platform through which “different industries can be rethought in different ways so that your friends are there with you.”
In response to a question about why Facebook had not followed in the footsteps of Microsoft and Google and started a Boston branch, Zuckerberg struck a hopeful tone but confirmed that there are no immediate plans for an East Coast presence.
Facebook has opened one development office in Seattle, Wash., according to Zuckerberg, in large part because it is in the same time zone as the company’s Palo Alto, Calif. office.
“We want to really get the culture there [in Seattle] right before we start opening up other offices, but at some point hopefully down the line we will do that,” he said.
Students who swarmed to Lamont to catch a glimpse of Zuckerberg had mixed responses about his appearance, however many of them agreed that he was not as grand as they had previously expected.
“He has very little charisma,” said Jay R. Chakravarty ’15. “I was expecting him to be a lot taller.”
Breeanna M. Elliott ’14, on the other hand, said she was impressed by Zuckerberg’s direct—albeit brief—answers to questions and his down-to-earth, casual manner.
“He wasn’t very assuming,” she said about Zuckerberg.
Following the press conference, Computer Science Senior Lecturer David J. Malan ’99 posed questions to Zuckerberg and Facebook Vice President of Engineering Mike Schroepfer at a panel event that was held in Farkas Hall.
Attendees said that his casual demeanor made Zuckerberg’s ascension in the world of startups seem more attainable.
“I thought it was really interesting that Mark kind of emphasized that he never expected Facebook to become what it did,” said Thomas M. MacWilliam ’13. “[He’s] definitely not the jerk in the movie—he’s a really great guy.”
Students had submitted resumés in advance to the Office of Career Services to take part in the discussion. About 200 were accepted on a first-come-first served basis.
Panelists addressed a range of topics that were based on questions that had been previously submitted by students—topics included Facebook’s approach to privacy, the advantages of start-ups versus companies, and the early days of Facebook, according to Julia C. Winn ’12.
A select group of students from Harvard and MIT were invited to join Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives at a private reception that was held in the Meridian Hotel, according to MacWilliam.
Zuckerberg’s visit to Harvard is part of a three-university recruiting trip along the East Coast that also hopes to attract students from MIT and Carnegie Mellon University.
“There’s a lot of really smart people here,” Zuckerberg answered during the press conference when asked why he chose to recruit at both Harvard and MIT. “And a lot of them are making decisions about where they’re going to work when they graduate in the next couple of weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard football team’s 35-21 victory at Columbia Saturday, the game ball wasn’t awarded to senior quarterback Collier W. Winters ’12, who threw for 300 yards and three touchdowns while also running for a score. Nor did it go to tight end Kyle P. Juszczyk ’13, who caught a season-high seven balls for 118 yards and two touchdowns. It didn’t even get tossed to cornerback Brian F. Owusu ’13, whose third-quarter interception in a tied ball game helped swing the balance of the contest in the Crimson’s favor.
Instead, captain Alex A. Gedeon ’12 handed the game ball to the man who led them all into battle: Harvard football coach Tim Murphy. The win over Columbia marked the 118th time that Murphy had marched Harvard off of the gridiron with a victory—a school record.
While the team doesn’t usually award game balls, Gedeon and Winters had decided in advance of the contest that it would be the best way to honor their coach.
“We didn’t want to put too much emphasis on it because we are in the middle of our season,” Winters said. “But we did want to think of something to commemorate it, something that he can hold on to and remember the game.”
Surpassing his predecessor Joseph Restic, Murphy now finds himself seventh all-time in wins among Ivy League coaches. It took Murphy only 18 years to reach the milestone, while Restic collected his 117 wins over a span of 23 seasons.
Murphy, a former Springfield College linebacker, has accrued his wins fairly consistently over his Harvard tenure. The Crimson hasn’t posted a losing record since 1998 and, thanks to its win Saturday, has now recorded 11 straight seven-win seasons—a feat no other Ancient Eight squad has ever accomplished.
To many, Murphy breaking the school record was inevitable.
“It was just a matter of time before this was going to happen,” former Crimson running back Kai-Cheng Ho ’10 said. “That’s probably been established since he first came to Harvard. Just by the way he leads, the way he implements the program and selects players and the coaching staff, it doesn’t surprise me at all that he broke the record.”
After nearly a decade as an assistant coach at three schools, Murphy got his first chance to run the show at Maine University in 1987. Following two successful campaigns—including earning a share of the Yankee Conference crown in his first season—Murphy moved on to the University of Cincinnati.
In his fifth season in the Queen City, Murphy led the Bearcats to their first winning campaign in over a decade, laying the groundwork for what would be their first bowl game appearance in 46 years in 1997. By that time though, Murphy was already in Cambridge, where he arrived following the 1993 season.
While racking up wins, Murphy has garnered respect from coaches around the Ivy League.
“His teams are always very well prepared. They are well-conditioned and they play hard year after year after year,” said Dartmouth coach Eugene ‘Buddy’ Teevens. “He’s demanding. He’s direct. He has high expectations of his players and his team. But he’s always very supportive and encouraging.”
And Murphy’s role on the board of the American Football Coaches Association highlights the respect he receives nationwide. The Harvard coach is currently the first vice president of the 11,000-member organization and will likely become the next president—a position Teevens said was his trade’s greatest honor.
When Murphy attains that title, he will join the likes of legendary coaches Bo Schembechler and Woody Hayes, as well as Restic.
If there is a group that reveres Murphy more than his coaching peers, it would be his players.
“He’s just a man of tremendous character and courage,” Ho said. “He’s a coach of life. I’m very fortunate to have spent four years under his wing.”
Another former running back, Clifton Dawson ’07, praised his coach for his leadership skills.
“Players from all walks of life come join the football team, and he’s always been able to unite players to be a team and represent Harvard,” Dawson said. “He’s an incredible sort of leader, not only for football but for the University.”
Current team members said they felt honored to help their coach reach this significant milestone.
“It feels great to be a part of that,” Juszczyk said after the game. “I know Coach Murphy won’t give himself enough credit, but he’s done a great job coaching us, and I couldn’t be happier.”
As Murphy continues to rewrite the record book, Teevens said the 55-year-old will cement his spot among the current greats of the game.
“You look at Joe Paterno and the top coaches,” Teevens said. “And [Murphy] is in that category.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The crowd at the Bright Hockey Center erupted Friday night as a third period wrist shot from Crimson junior forward Luke Greiner sailed under the glove of Princeton goaltender Sean Bonar and into the back of the net, bringing Harvard (0-1-0, 0-1-0 ECAC) within one goal of the Tigers (1-1-1, 1-1-0) with just over eight minutes to play.
Despite the Crimson’s heroics, the Princeton defense held strong for the remainder of the game, and the Harvard men’s hockey team could not find an equalizer as it fell, 4-3, in its opening contest of the 2011-2012 season.
The Crimson was forced to battle from behind for most of the game.
The Tigers struck first on a power-play goal from senior forward Brodie Zuk, who gathered and scored a loose puck in front of net with just under a minute left in the first period to give Princeton the early lead.
Six minutes into the second period, Tiger junior defenseman Michael Sdao added a second power-play goal, as his shot flew past screened freshman goaltender Steve Michalek to give the Tigers a 2-0 edge.
A minute later, consecutive Princeton penalties gave the Crimson a five-on-three advantage.
The Tigers escaped unscathed, but Harvard senior forward Alex Killorn buried a close range shot set up by junior forward Alex Fallstrom just as the power-play expired.
Princeton extended its lead to two goals minutes into the third period, when freshman forward Aaron Kesselman put home a rebound in front of net.
But after a Tiger penalty, Killorn responded with his second goal of the night on a wrist shot assisted by junior forward Conor Morrison to again cut the deficit to one with 12:30 remaining in the game.
A Crimson penalty two minutes later ended in a fourth goal for Princeton, this one delivered by senior defenseman Derrick Pallis. Down 4-2 with less than nine minutes to play, Harvard responded swiftly.
Greiner took the puck down the ice, split the defense, and fired a shot on net to tally the Crimson’s third goal with eight minutes to play.
Harvard was unable to capitalize on the momentum.
The Tigers attack was relentless in the waning minutes of the game—Michalek made several key saves just to keep the Crimson’s chances alive.
After a penalty, Harvard was left with just over a minute to find the game-tying goal, but its desperate six-on-five attempt fell short, and Princeton skated off with the win.
“There are a lot of things we can improve on as a team,” Crimson coach Ted Donato said.
Harvard was plagued by inconsistency throughout the game—the home side was dominant at times and struggled at others.
“We played very well in spurts, but I don’t think we had that for the entire game,” Killorn said.
Both Killorn and Donato pointed out that there were likely some rust and nerves, as expected in the first game of a season. Princeton was playing in its third game on the year.
“No matter how long you practice, it’s different than an actual game,” Killorn said.
Donato was quick to give the Tigers credit for their physical play.
“They made it tough in front of the net,” Donato said.
Considering three of Princeton’s four goals came on the power play, the Crimson’s penalty kill will be an area of heavy focus early in the season.
“We could definitely do a much better job blocking shots [on the penalty kill]” captain defenseman Ryan Grimshaw said. “But I think a lot of kids are ready to get their bodies in front of pucks.”
Despite a tough loss, Harvard will take a few positives away from the game. While the penalty kill struggled, the Crimson’s power play was strong.
Of the four power plays it drew, Harvard converted on one and scored just as another expired.
Michalek made 34 saves in net, including two impressive stops on Tiger breakaways in the third period to keep Harvard within striking distance.
Princeton did score four goals, but two came on rebounded loose pucks in front of the net.
Donato also complimented the play of freshman defenseman Patrick McNally in solidifying the Crimson defense.
The game marked the first collegiate experience for the Crimson’s highly touted freshmen class.
Along with McNally and Michalek, forwards Colin Blackwell, Tommy O’Regan and Petr Placek, and defenseman Max Everson all saw their first game action for Harvard.
While the Crimson players hope to avoid playing from behind in future games, there was a silver lining to be found in the close loss.
“It does speak a lot to the character we have of this team,” Grimshaw said. “We battled back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After failing to find victory in its last 12 outings, the Harvard men’s soccer team travelled to New York City this weekend in hopes of picking up its first Ivy win.
But attempt No. 13 proved to be as fruitless as the previous 12, as the Crimson (2-11-3, 0-5-1 Ivy) fell on the road at Columbia (8-7-1, 4-2 Ivy) on Saturday night, 2-1.
Though sophomore forward Connor McCarthy notched a goal for the second straight game, the pair of goals scored by Columbia’s Ronnie Shaban proved to be insurmountable for Harvard.
“It’s tough to lose,” McCarthy said. “We definitely didn’t play well in the first half, but our performance in the second half was good.”
Playing at Columbia University Soccer Stadium in Manhattan, N.Y., the Lions came out strong offensively, immediately placing pressure on the away side’s back line. Within the first few minutes of the match, Crimson senior goalkeeper Austin Harms was tested by Columbia’s offense. And in the 16th minute, the Lions’ relentless pressure caused the Crimson back line to crack.
At 15:34, Columbia midfielder David Najem fired a shot on goal that rebounded off the goal post and into play. As the Harvard defense attempted to clear the loose ball out of its penalty area, a Lions attacker went down in the process, leading to a penalty kick for Columbia.
Stepping up to the penalty spot for the Lions was Shaban, who summarily blasted the ball past Harms to give Columbia the early lead, 1-0.
After tallying its first goal of the match, the Lions showed no signs of letting up, as the Columbia offense continued to challenge the Harvard defense midway through the first half. A little more than 10 minutes after the first goal, Shaban scored another goal for Columbia, this time with a well-placed header to the back post off a corner kick by junior forward Nick Scott.
Suddenly down by two scores in the first half, the Crimson responded by increasing its offensive pressure for the remainder of the half.
With just seconds remaining on the clock, sophomore defender Pascal Mensah looked poised to cut down Columbia’s lead, but his last-second header floated just above the cross bar.
The start of the second period saw a change for the Crimson at net, with junior goalkeeper Brett Conrad replacing Harms.
Ten minutes into the second half during the 55th minute, the Crimson’s efforts finally paid off when McCarthy blasted a point-blank shot past Lions goalkeeper Alexander Aurrichio.
McCarthy’s opportunity was set up following a corner kick by sophomore defender Ross Friedman to junior defender Richard Smith, who then passed the ball to the waiting feet of McCarthy.
Buoyed by its first goal, the Crimson immediately regrouped in search of the equalizer.
With less than 27 minutes remaining in the match, Harvard looked to have completed that search when Schmoll unleashed a promising attempt on goal. But the freshman midfielder’s shot hit the crossbar and bounced back into play. Co-captain midfielder Tim Linden looked certain to knock in the rebound, but his shot flew wide of the net and out of play.
During the 74th minute, with Harvard taking a corner kick, Friedman launched a dangerous cross into the penalty box, but a foul was called on the Crimson before the ball could connect with the head of a Harvard attacker.
Harvard continued maintained its attack on the Lions’ back line for much of the second half, but despite its best efforts the Crimson was unable to finish any chances.
“Though we weren’t able to fully come back against Columbia like we did against Colgate, I think the last two games have shown our level of resiliency,” McCarthy said. “When we go down, we are good at picking each other up and trying to get back in the game and continuing to compete.”
With the victory, Columbia moves into a tie for third place in the Ivy League, and Harvard was sent back to Cambridge still in search of its first conference victory. The Crimson will attempt to grab its first Ivy win in its season finale against Penn Saturday.
“[Penn] is going to be another game where we enter it thinking that we are the better team and fully expecting to get three points from it,” McCarthy said. “Some of the results haven’t gone our way this year, but that hasn’t changed our mentality or the fact that we have a lot of quality talent on our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down a touchdown to Columbia with much of the first half in the books—what Harvard coach Tim Murphy later called “the sloppiest half of football we’ve played this year”—the Crimson football team looked like it was in trouble.
With only seven league games, each one is vital to a title run. So, even in Saturday’s contest, which was billed as a tune-up for the Crimson, an exhibition match against a featherweight before stacking up against the big boys, victory was critical. A loss, and Harvard’s title chances might’ve been KO-ed.
Victory midway through the first half looked anything but assured. Much of that can be attributed to an underrated Lions team, whose record belies its talent.
But more importantly, after the Harvard football team took the field at WienStadium, very quickly it became clear that the typically error-free Crimson offense had gone missing.
In those first 30 minutes of play, the Harvard attack looked like it forgot that only NFL teams get bye weeks.
An interception and two fumbles—one of which was lost—cost the Crimson dearly in those first two quarters.
But an even bigger problem early on was the Crimson offensive line. On Saturday, Harvard’s feel-good story of the year didn’t look so good.
Unable to handle the strong Columbia D-line, the jumpy Crimson O-line committed false start after false start in the first half.
The Harvard attack looked to be battling two opponents: the Columbia defense and itself.
And so Murphy, who knows a thing or two about coaching, stepped in, pulling the offense aside after an early drive.
“I said, ‘[Have] poise.’ One of the characteristics that has been so strong this year has been poise, especially for a young offensive line group,” Murphy said. “I wouldn’t say we lost it, but we were kind of on the edge there. After that, we settled down a bit.”
And soon after, the penalties faded away, the mistakes went by the wayside, and the vaunted, record-book-defacing Harvard offense found its form.
While the Crimson failed to score 40 or more points for the fifth straight game—the first time that would have happened since the 19th century—Winters and his receivers put on a show. It is New York City, after all.
Throwing for 323 yards, Winters showed off his arm all day on Saturday, despite the first-half offensive troubles. With the senior behind center, third-and-25 became doable. Of course, a porous Lions secondary helped Winters’ cause.
But the Harvard gunslinger’s biggest weapon may not be his cannon-like appendage, but rather his arsenal of receivers.
When he needs a big play, he’s got senior Chris Lorditch. The two connected in 2009’s rendition of The Game, and after both missed much of last season due to injury, the duo is back and picking apart opposing secondaries once again.
At Wien Stadium, the two connected again. From the Columbia 41, Winters threw a Hail Mary downfield to Lorditch.
The senior leapt up, outmaneuvering the opposing defensive back to snag the ball. He then waltzed into the end zone, giving Harvard what proved to be an insurmountable 14-point lead.
But Winters has more than just Lorditch. He has two bruising tight ends, including junior Kyle Juszczyk, whose 118 receiving yards were second-best for Harvard on Saturday.
On one of the most impressive plays of the day, Winters hit Juszczyk near the right sideline. The junior then broke one tackle, broke another, and stumbled his way to the end zone, diving past the pylon for a 41-yard touchdown reception.
When Winters needs a break, he has junior Treavor Scales and freshman Zach Boden in the backfield. Scales was one broken tackle away from a 87-yard touchdown against the Lions. Boden, who has come out of nowhere this year to be a stalwart, set up an important Harvard touchdown with back-to-back 11 and 12-yard runs in the Lions end zone.
In the end, the Harvard attack and the Crimson defense proved to be too much. But the Lions put up a hell of a fight and made it interesting until the end.
Ultimately, the victory is Harvard’s, and with two Ivy games left on the docket, and an undefeated league mark, the Crimson now sits pretty. A win against Penn or Yale will assure Harvard at least a share of the Ivy title. Two victories, and the title comes back to Cambridge.
If you didn’t look hard enough, you might’ve missed the biggest news from Wien Stadium, though.
There was no Gatorade bath, no huge post-game celebration. When Tim Murphy became the winningest coach in his program’s long and storied history, he wasn’t carried off the field. Sure he received the game ball, but even in his “thanks,” he just passed off the credit to others.
Murphy now has his eyes set on a different sort of prize: his sixth Ivy crown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard freshman Colin Blackwell sunk the puck into the Quinnipiac net, simultaneously crashing into the goal and dislodging it. The crowd at the Bright Hockey Center erupted in cheers at the prospect of the Crimson’s first go-ahead goal of the season-opening weekend.
But, after video review, the goal was disallowed. The Harvard men’s hockey team (0-1-1, 0-1-1 ECAC) was never able to take the lead after this crucial call, finishing the match in a 2-2 deadlock with the Bobcats (7-3-1, 1-1-1) on Saturday night.
“I thought we played well,” captain Ryan Grimshaw said. “We learned from some of our mistakes [Friday], and we picked it up. Again, we were resilient, coming from behind on both goals to tie it up. It would have been nice to get the win, but it was a step in the right direction.”
For the majority of the first period, Harvard and Quinnipiac appeared to be evenly matched.
After winning a faceoff at 14:14, the Crimson attempted six shots in the remaining minutes of the period, but Harvard failed to capitalize on these opportunities.
With less than two minutes remaining in the period, Quinnipiac junior Jeremy Langlois broke the scoreless tie with his first goal of the season. Langlois was assisted by senior Scott Zurevinski and freshman Matthew Peca.
The Crimson bounced back early in the second period.
The Harvard players passed strategically in Quinnipiac territory, allowing Harvard junior Conor Morrison to score a power-play goal just over a minute into play. Morrison was assisted by senior Alex Killorn, who won six out of six faceoff attempts leading up to the first Crimson goal.
“I thought our guys battled,” Harvard coach Ted Donato said. “I think after we scored the first goal, the Morrison goal, we were able to get them pinned in their zone a lot more often.”
Each team put an additional point on the board in the remainder of the second period. Crimson junior David Valek scored the game-tying goal for Harvard off of a rebounded shot.
“We want this to be one of our identities,” Valek said regarding his goal. “We want to get pucks and bodies to the net and get more of these so-called dirty goals.”
The third period and overtime play did not see any goals scored. After consistently coming from behind but failing to get ahead, the 2-2 result was a somewhat disappointing one for the Crimson team.
“We were playing to win the hockey game,” Donato said. “With 1:20 left in the third period, we called a timeout, really to rest up and get after it. In the locker room afterwards, I think our guys felt good about the effort, but I don’t think there were a lot of smiles.”
Despite the tie, there were many positive elements of the Crimson’s performance. Harvard had 25 shots on goal, nearly matching Quinnipiac’s 26. Coming off of the loss to the Tigers, the team focused on increasing its physicality and finishing its checks. Harvard’s mental game also showed improvement, particularly in response to the team’s disallowed goal.
“The game has a lot of ups and downs, especially when you play a team of [Quinnipiac’s] offensive ability,” Donato said. “Our guys are mentally starting to know what we need to do to win hockey games and be able to recover from a goal against, a bad bounce, or a bad call.”
In addition, Harvard’s defense had a strong performance. Sophomore goalie Raphael Girard had 24 saves and shut down all of Quinnipiac’s power-play opportunities. Freshman Steve Michalek started at the position the previous night in the season-opener, demonstrating that the goalie job may still be up for grabs.
“I think Raphael was excellent tonight, he came up with two huge saves,” Donato said.  “We have two great goalies, and we want to get to the point where both of them can come in and win hockey games. I hope they will push each other, and that our team will be able to perform well in front of them.”
With its first two official games under its belt, the Crimson will take on Cornell and Colgate next weekend at home. The team seeks to define and unite itself with each additional game.
“Whenever you start the season, you are pushing to create a team identity,” Donato said. “I think we made a positive step towards that on Saturday night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, N.Y.—For a team without a win this season, Columbia has still kept up with the best in the Ivy League.
Against reigning Ancient Eight champion Penn, the Lions lost on a last-minute touchdown. Facing Yale last week, Columbia mounted a 13-point fourth-quarter rally but once again fell just short.
And on Saturday against Harvard, the Lions gave Harvard its first scare in weeks—during the first half, at least.
The Lions opened the game with a methodical, 12-play drive that gave Columbia its first lead since Oct. 15 against the Quakers.
No play in the series went for more than 14 yards, but the Crimson defensive line struggled early against Columbia’s run game.
Harvard tied things up in the first quarter and threatened early in the second. A 43-yard completion to senior wide receiver Chris Lorditch put the Crimson deep in Columbia territory.
With about 9:30 on the clock, senior quarterback Collier Winters threw a red-zone pick along the right sideline, and Ross Morand took it back 87 yards for a touchdown.
It was a play highly reminiscent of a pick-six in Harvard’s season opener against Holy Cross, the team’s only loss of the year.
The Crimson went into halftime tied after another touchdown late in the frame, and the team took a lead in the third and never trailed again in the game.
“Offensively, there were not real adjustments [at the half],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We just said, ‘Hey, what’s our mantra? What’s our thing?’ Our whole thing is just take care of the football.”
The Lions could very easily have had the lead at halftime.
On the second-to-last play of the first quarter, freshman running back Zach Boden fumbled near midfield, and Columbia recovered but failed to score on the drive.
In the final minutes of the second quarter, the Lions failed to get into field goal range, and it could not convert on fourth-and-four.
O-LINE, WHERE ART THOU?
One of the strengths—and biggest surprises—for Harvard this season has been its offensive line. But after one of its best performances of the year last week against Dartmouth, it had one of its worst in Manhattan.
Winters threw for 323 yards and 3 touchdowns, but he was still under pressure the entire afternoon.
The Harvard passer was sacked five times for 31 yards—more sacks than the Crimson had allowed in its past three games combined.
A sloppy day from the offensive line didn’t end there. One week after a 395-yard rushing game against the Big Green, Harvard managed only 163 against the Lions.
Much like the rest of the team, the line had an inauspicious start to Saturday’s game. Harvard attempted just one run play all quarter—a six-yarder from Boden—and relied almost exclusively on the arm of Winters.
The group also made a number of mental errors—an unusual set of mistakes for one of the better lines in the Ivies.
“They played uncharacteristically, I think, in the first half,” Columbia coach Norries Wilson said. “[Freshman offensive tackle Will Whitman] is going to be a great player at offensive line.”
In one two-play stretch in the first quarter, the offensive line committed three false starts, putting the Crimson in a third-and-25 situation. Later in the same drive, the team was hit with another false start in the red zone. Harvard took two more false starts in the second quarter before settling down.
“We felt like their front four—they rotated eight guys—was very athletic, and they were very good,” Murphy said. “At times, they put a lot of pressure on us today, and at times it got ugly. The pocket got compressed, [and] we had a couple of turnovers under pressure.”
CATCH AND RELEASE
With the way the Crimson struggled in the first half, the game could have gone very differently if not for solid performances from Harvard’s receivers. Winters used seven receivers in the game, but there were two clear standout performances.
Junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk had one of his best games of the year, picking up 118 yards and scoring twice. Senior wide receiver Chris Lorditch also passed the 100-yard mark and scored a touchdown of his own.
Both Juszczyk and Lorditch had 41-yard receptions in the second half on a pair of plays that opened up the game for good.
In the third quarter, Lorditch hauled one in along the sideline before cutting inside to get to the end zone and give Harvard a 28-14 lead.
Eight minutes later, Winters found Juszczyk wide open downfield. The junior tight end out-ran the defense and dove in just before Columbia could catch him.
“The reason I kind of dove to the end zone is that I wasn’t really sure if anyone was close to me,” Juszczyk said. “I’m sad to say, I’m not really used to being behind the defense. There’s normally some guys in front of me. But I’m getting used to it now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team closed out its fall season with a strong showing at the William & Mary Invitational held this past weekend at the McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center in Williamsburg, Va.
In competition against William & Mary, George Washington University, and UMBC, Harvard won a total of 21 out of 27 singles matches and 10 out of 13 doubles matches to cap off a successful fall season.
“I think everybody had a good weekend,” said Harvard assistant coach Andrew Rueb. “It was the culmination of a lot of work this fall. Their games were clicking, and they were improving as the weekend went on.”
Freshman Henry Steer, a semifinalist last weekend at the Harvard Halloween Invitational, never dropped a set en route to a perfect 4-0 record and a place on the All-Tournament team.
In his first two matches of the Invitational on Friday, Steer downed George Washington’s Viktor Svensson, 6-1, 7-6, and then carried the momentum to another straight-set victory over Daniel Gray of UMBC, 6-3, 6-3.
Steer displayed an even more impressive performance in his third match of the weekend, taking down Adrian Vodislav of William & Mary, 6-2, 6-2.
Playing at the No. 2 position, freshman Denis Nguyen also did not disappoint, going 4-0 for the weekend and joining Steer on the six-member All-Tournament singles squad. Nguyen’s only loss of a set came in his third match of the weekend against William and Mary’s John Banks.
Nguyen secured the opening set, 6-2, but then dropped the second set in a tiebreak before closing the match out, 10-5 in the third set. In his opening two matches, Nguyen crushed both of his opponents in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, and 6-4, 6-1.
Co-captain Ali Felton was the final Crimson player to go undefeated in singles for the weekend.
He cruised past Richard Blumenfield of George Washington, 6-4, 6-1, and nearly bageled UMBC’s Eric Jarkowski, 6-0, 6-1.
Felton’s hardest challenge came in William & Mary’s Robert Pietrucha. Felton’s opponent stormed through the first set, 6-2, but then Felton battled his way back to even the match at one set apiece. Felton dominated in the final set to close out the match, 2-6, 6-1, 10-1.
Following up from his victory last weekend at the Harvard Halloween Invitational, freshman Alex Steinroeder went 3-1 in Flight 1 for Harvard to make the All-Tournament team as well.
In his first match, Steinroeder fell to George Washington’s Francisco Dias, 6-4, 6-7, 10-6. Despite the loss, the Concord, Mass. native rebounded to defeat UMBC’s Joe Adewomi, 6-2, 6-3, on the same day.
His momentum carried over into Saturday with another victory over William & Mary’s Anton Andersson, 6-3, 6-2.
“In singles, I feel like I played really well,” Steinroeder said. “The one match I lost was really close and I played a good player. Overall, I felt it was a successful weekend.”
The squad’s other co-captain, Davis Mangham, also won three out of four matches for the weekend.
The senior won his first three matches fairly easily but lost on the final day of competition. Mangham defeated Leonardo Lapentti of George Washington, 6-1, 6-3, and Kamal Patel of UMBC, 6-2, 6-3.
Mangham gutted out his third match win to defeat William & Mary’s Charlie Ghriskey, 3-6, 6-3, 10-4.
Freshman Shaun Chaudhuri, the other semifinalist at the Harvard Halloween Invitational, went 2-2 for the weekend.
George Washington’s Alexander Van Gils defeated Chaudhuri in the first match, 6-3, 6-3, but Chaudhuri evened his weekend record against UMBC’s Gaulthier Berret, 7-6, 6-3.
Chaudhuri fell in his third match against Ilja Orre of William & Mary before winning his final match of the event yesterday.
The Crimson squad also found success in many of the doubles matches. Felton and Steinroeder won all three of their four matches to make the All-Tournament team in doubles. The only loss for the duo came against the George Washington pairing of Ulrik Thomsen and van Gils. The Crimson narrowly lost, 9-8.
Junior Andy Nguyen and Denis Nguyen won all four of their matches in doubles for the Invitational and matched Felton and Steinroeder in being named one of three All-Tournament pairings.
The brothers started out with an 8-4 on Friday and then captured two back-to-back 8-5 victories on Saturday. Sophomore Josh Tchan and Mangham pulled out an 8-1 win over the UMBC duo of Jarkowski and Patel and Steer and Chaudhuri also won against the William & Mary pairing of Vodislav and Zach Brag, 9-7.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the season on the line, Harvard’s men’s water polo secured a spot in the Collegiate Water Polo Association Eastern Championships with an 11-10 overtime victory against host MIT (10-15, 4-4 CWPA) in the opening round of this weekend’s CWPA Northern Division Championships.
The Crimson (9-18, 6-9) finished the weekend in fourth place, after losing to Brown (16-9), 18-9, Saturday evening and falling to Iona (14-13), 13-11, in the third-place game on Sunday.
“We’re really excited that we made Easterns,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “It would have been really bad if we had to host Easterns and watch other people play.”
In their last chance to qualify for the Eastern Championships, the seniors on the team reached a milestone for their class, as they battled all weekend to earn Harvard’s first berth in this tournament since 2007.
“There were some real gutsy performances by the seniors,” senior attacker Michael Katzer said. “A ton of credit to everyone who hit the water and everyone on the team.”
IONA 13, HARVARD 11
Already qualified for Easterns, the Crimson looked to end the weekend on a strong note, but eventually gave up a fourth-quarter lead to lose a tight match to the Gaels from New Rochelle, N.Y.
“We lost a tough one this morning to Iona,” Minnis said. “We had a lead going in to the fourth quarter, [and we] probably should have closed that out. They outplayed us and outhustled us in the fourth quarter, so that’s tough.”
Despite the loss, the close finish demonstrates Harvard’s improvement over the season, considering Iona beat the Crimson by a nine-goal margin in September.
With the Gaels qualifying for the Eastern Tournament as well, Harvard may have the chance to redeem itself in a potential rematch two weeks from now at Blodget Pool.
BROWN 18, HARVARD 9
Against No. 17 Brown, Harvard showed resilience throughout the game, keeping it close until fatigue set in for the Crimson in the fourth quarter, allowing the Bears to take control and advance to the finals.
The Crimson kept this one within reach for most of the game, trailing 6-4 after one quarter and 11-7 at the half. The third quarter was a defensive battle, with only one goal scored by the Brown offense.
But in the fourth quarter, the Bears tallied six goals against a worn-out Harvard squad, sending the Crimson to the third-place game against Iona.
“We played Brown the toughest we played all year, so I was real happy with the way we played,” Minnis said. “They’re a real good team, so [it was good] for us to be in the game in the third quarter. We just kind of ran out of gas. They kind of took over and dominated in the fourth.”
Brown junior Svetosar Stefeanovic was a key player for the Bears, with five goals, four steals, and five ejections drawn.
For Harvard, Katzer and freshman utility Max Murphy continued their strong play, both netting two goals apiece. Senior Evan Zepfel also contributed two goals.
In net, senior goalie Alex Popp held his own, stopping 13 shots from Brown in the losing effort, while also providing some offensive spark with two assists.
HARVARD 11, MIT 10 (OT)
Coming into this weekend, the Crimson’s focus was on the opening game against the Engineers, as a win would guarantee a spot in the Eastern tournament.
“While the regular season was important, we kind of looked at it as a way to gear us up for the big game, which was this past Saturday’s game against MIT,” Katzer said.
The team came out ready to go, having developed an extensive game plan throughout the week before. Harvard ensured it knew what its opponent would give them, both offensively and defensively.
“We wanted to make sure we did a good job against their weak side drop, offensively,” Minnis said. “Defensively, we wanted to make sure we had pressure on them at all times. It made it difficult for them to move and get comfortable in their ball-side drive offense.”
It was a tightly contested match throughout regular play, with no team pulling ahead by more than one goal at any time.
Popp had a huge game in net, contributing 13 saves and stopping two five-meter penalty shots.
“Alex has had a phenomenal year, and he maybe played his game of the year against MIT,” Katzer said. “The fact that he stopped those two point-blank really motivated the team.”
In overtime, co-captain Luka Babic netted a goal, his second of the game, and Katzer scored twice, completing the hat trick to send the Crimson into the semifinals. But overall, it was a team effort.
“I just wasn’t willing to let this game get away from us,” Katzer said. “I had a couple goals, but goals only happen if the five players in the pool are doing their job and making good passes.”
Two freshmen added to the winning effort as well. Attacker Evan Ramsey had two goals and four steals, and Murphy had two goals and two steals.
With two more weeks of water polo remaining, Harvard will look to build off this weekend in preparation for the final tournament of the season.
“Hopefully, we’ll get some big crowds and people out there to support our seniors and the rest of the team,” Minnis said. “It’ll be a lot of fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The news wasn’t all bad this weekend for Harvard (11-11, 4-8 Ivy), who suffered two losses at the hands of Columbia (15-7, 9-3 Ivy), 25-19, 25-22, 25-20, and Cornell (6-18, 3-9 Ivy), 21-25, 25-17, 25-22, 23-25, 15-13.
Co-captain libero Christine Wu moved into second place for the all-time record in digs in the Ivy League. She crossed the threshold with 28 digs on Friday night. Combined with another team-leading defensive performance on Saturday with 21 digs, Wu now holds the mark with 1,801 digs.
Wu has shown improvement and consistency over her career, registering a digs-per-set average of 4.11 in her freshman year, 5.11 as a sophomore, 4.48 the next year, and 5.55 thus far this campaign.
“I feel so grateful to get to be her teammate,” junior setter Beth Kinsella said. “We are so proud of her for getting in the record books, but it’s hardly a surprise, given her ridiculous defensive skills.  Wu is an inspiring leader and the most humble person you will ever meet.”
Of her accomplishment, Wu said, “Coming into my career, I wanted to leave a mark and help my team. [The achievement of being second all-time in the Ivy League] reflects a passion and commitment for the game.”
Wu, who plans on going to Europe to play for another season after graduation this year, is not quite ready to say goodbye to competitive sports.
“I love the game so much, I just can’t give it up.”
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 2
The tone was set from the get-go on Saturday with a combination of punches and counterattacks from each team.
The Crimson started off strong with a pair of kills from freshman middle blocker Caroline Walters and freshman outside hitter Kristen Casey.
The first set, which saw five ties and two lead changes, was secured by a string of three straight Harvard points to go up 22-18, thanks to a couple big Kinsella serves.
The next two sets belonged to an aggressive Big Red team, who had a hitting percentage of .279 for the match.
Facing elimination, the Crimson fought back valiantly as a team, with six players recording kills, including four from sophomore outside hitter Kelsey Beck to win the fourth set. In the fifth set, though Harvard closed a 7-2 gap to take a 10-9 lead, it was unable to hold on and lost, 15-13.
“Two points were the difference between us winning and losing, which was frustrating, because we really picked up our game near the end of the match,” Kinsella said.
The highly-contested battle occurred on a night when Cornell paid homage to its four seniors.
“Their fans didn’t really affect us directly, but it gave the Cornell girls a bit more energy and momentum to fight,” Wu said. “We didn’t respond as well.”
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 0
Friday’s match was closer than the 3-0 score indicated.
After narrowing a 20-9 first-set lead in Columbia’s favor, the Crimson fell short, losing by a score of 25–19.
In the second set, Harvard and the Lions battled all the way through with six lead changes and 13 ties.
Despite leading by three early, the Crimson was unable to break through, losing the second set, 25-22, on an attack error by Casey.
Second-place Columbia went on to win the third set, 25-20, and take the match.
“We made a lot of errors at the wrong time and allowed Columbia to get large leads on us that were difficult to come back from despite hard efforts from our hitters, including Kristen Casey and Teresa Skelly,” Kinsella said.
With the losses, Harvard will split the season set with Columbia and account for two of Cornell’s three wins in the Ivy League.
Despite the loss, Harvard and its seniors—who just completed the last road trip of their career—recognized the value of the season, and mostly, that it’s not over.
“Despite the outcome, I’m so proud to be a member of the Harvard volleyball team,” co-captain Sandra Lynne Fryhofer said. “Any other year, I would have been upset by the outcome. But with a senior perspective, I know that in the end, I won’t remember the specific wins or losses.”
The Crimson closes its season with two home matches next weekend against Yale and Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard field hockey entered its last game of the season Friday sitting at .500 both overall and in league play.
The Crimson sought to topple the Lions and close its year with a winning record for the first time since 2004, but Columbia (9-8, 5-2) shut out Harvard (8-9, 3-4 Ivy League), 3-0, Friday evening, under the lights of the Baker Field Athletic Complex in New York, N.Y.
Despite the loss and overall losing record, the 2011 season represents Harvard’s most successful in the Ivy League since 2007, when it went 4-3 in the Ancient Eight and 8-9 overall.
“It wasn’t the result that we hoped for [Friday] night,” co-captain Georgia McGillivray said. “But I think overall, this season has been so great, and our team has grown so much from last year and the year before. We are not trying to dwell on a specific game or loss and are just focusing on ... the improvements we’ve made over the past year.”
The Crimson’s most recent success has been fueled in part by junior goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos.
Tassopoulos entered the game against Columbia ranked second in the nation for save percentages (.816) and fifth in the nation in saves per game (9.25).
In the Ivy League, the junior comfortably leads the conference with 62 saves and 152 overall—six of which were made in Friday’s game.
“Cynthia is incredible,” McGillivray said. “Not only in terms of her save percentage, but also just in terms of communicating on the field and organizing defensive plays, and making sure that everyone is in the right place at the right time.”
With Tassapoulos’ guidance in net, the Harvard defense had a strong performance, holding the Lions to just nine shots on goal.
But even with the solid defensive effort and the nationally-ranked powerhouse in the net, the Crimson was unable to respond offensively.
Harvard’s defense may have been able to contain Columbia to single digits in shots on goal, but the Crimson managed just four on-frame attempts.
“We weren’t able to get all the way up into their circle and create as many shots,” Tassopoulos said.
Harvard’s inability to score would prove to be its downfall, as the Lions scored three unanswered goals on the Crimson to secure a third-place finish in the Ivy League and relegate Harvard to fifth.
The game commenced at a rapid pace. Within the first 15 seconds of play, the Crimson attacked the opponent’s circle, threatening to light up the scoreboard. But an official’s call gave the ball back to Columbia, and the Lions turned the fast-break opportunity into a hasty 1-0 lead.
“[It] was kind of a rough start,”  Tassopoulos said. “But I think after that, we still kept our momentum going, and so it was kind of back and forth.”
Co-captain midfielder Carly Dickson would get a look on goal six-and-a-half minutes into the contest after connecting off a Crimson penalty corner, only for it to be stopped by Columbia goalie Christie O’Hara.
The Lions’ goalie is also among the nation’s best, appearing 10th on the NCAA’s list in saves per game (8.29), and 11th in save percentages (.779).
Eleven minutes into the first half, Columbia’s Gabby Kozlowski found Adriana de Vries inside Harvard territory for an easy tap-in to bring the tally to 2-0, where it would remain for the duration of the half.
“At that point it kind of neutralized to where Columbia and [we] were playing pretty evenly for the rest of the second half,” Tassopoulos said.
The Crimson returned from halftime prepared to apply some much-needed tweaks to its game.
“We came out really strong and we were ready to make adjustments,” Tassopoulos said. “And I think a lot of those adjustments did take place to where we were able to really put some pressure on them and start to get more of our offense going. It was definitely more of a game in the midfield.”
Despite its opponents halftime adjustments, the Lions edged even further ahead of Harvard by converting on a penalty corner in the second period.
The Crimson defense successfully blocked the initial corner shot, but the ball found its way to the back of the net off of a ricochet, digging Harvard into a three-goal deficit from which it would never recover.
“After [Columbia’s third goal] we were still pushing,” Tassopoulos said. “I would say it was pretty even for the rest of the game; we just weren’t able to put the ball away. We were moving in the right direction; we just kind of ran out of time.”
The season-ending loss marked the end of Dickson and McGillivray’s careers with the Crimson.
“It was a good effort by everyone on the team,” McGillivray said. “We battled hard for 70 minutes, but it just didn’t really come together for us in the end.”

Put down that celery stick and throw away your anti-chafe nipple cream (for you overzealous Hemenway treadmillers). Research carried out by Jay Zagorsky of Ohio State University and Patricia K. Smith of University of Michigan shows that the "freshman 15" phenomenon is false.
 
In the study, the researchers found that female students put on an average of about three pounds during their freshman year while males gained around three and a half pounds, which in the case of males is only a half pound more than people of the same age who did not attend college.
 
Furthermore, the study states that 90 percent of freshmen do not gain the dreaded 15 pounds. One quarter of freshmen actually lose weight during the first year of college (obviously those students don't hold the quantity of the dining hall food above than the quality). 
 
"I actually lost weight since I've been here. Like a pound or two," said Ryan J. Osleeb '15.
 
While not all students escape the freshman 15 (about ten percent succumb to the pants-tightening phenomenon) it is mostly those who drink large amounts of alcohol, especially calorie-packed beverages like beer.
 
"Alcohol will lead to weight gain, especially if you're not used to drinking. You're getting a lot more carbohydrates than you're used to getting," said Science and Cooking Professor David A. Weitz.
 
While "freshman 15" may not be the best term to use, "college 15" may be more fitting.
The researchers did find that females gain an average of about nine pounds during their college years, while males gain around 13.4 pounds.
 
So try not to worry too much about trading one type of six-pack for another. At least not until sophomore year.
