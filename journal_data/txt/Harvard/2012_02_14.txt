After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Raising a sociopathic child who relishes violence is a respectable parent’s worst fear. Lynne Ramsay’s film adaptation of Lionel Shriver’s dark novel “We Need to Talk About Kevin” proves an eerily devastating portrayal of this nightmarish scenario. However, an unconvincing plot and two-dimensional set of characters severely limit the film’s potential. Though creepily entertaining and well-acted, “We Need to Talk About Kevin” lacks the realism and substantiated character motivations that would have transformed it from an artful horror movie into a masterpiece.
The story is told through a series of flashbacks from the protagonist Eva’s (Tilda Swinton) perspective. It is immediately apparent that her once-liberated spirit is now tied down by tragedy. She lives alone, and her son Kevin (Ezra Miller) has committed an as-yet-unrevealed heinous crime. The film continues to portray Eva’s life in the present interspersed with flashbacks that eventually depict her entire relationship with Kevin, from the time she was pregnant until a few days before his 16th birthday, when he locks the doors to his school gymnasium and systematically shoots and kills a number of his fellow students.
Eva and Kevin had a tumultuous relationship, beginning with severe kicking during the gestation period. It only worsens as Kevin grows up and finds new ways to inflict mental torture, all while playing the role of the perfect son around his father (John C. Reilly). It’s as though the only purpose of his existence is to make his mother as miserable as possible, whether by painting on her beloved maps as a toddler or leaving her a CD titled “I Love You” that actually contains a computer virus. Kevin’s horrific crime is hardly his last act, because Eva is forever labeled in their town as the “school-shooter’s mother” from then on. Having red paint splashed all over her house and getting slapped while on the street by mothers of victims, she endures this fate out of some need to take responsibility and accept guilt for her son’s actions.
The performances were commendable in spite of the limited potential for character development. Swinton perfectly exemplifies the silently suffering soldier, and Miller’s demonic teenager is subtle yet spine-chilling. However, Eva and Kevin are truly the only characters of substance; Reilly is believable as the trusting father, but anyone with an air of obliviousness could have played his role.
The film’s aesthetics add to its appeal. The use of unadorned cinematography contributes to the seemingly mundane setting of the story, which perfectly complements the plot about an outwardly normal family. This facade was also reflected by the background music of the film, exclusively composed of upbeat folk songs and uncomfortably loud everyday noises.
Unfortunately, the realism of the cinematography in “We Need to Talk About Kevin” outpaces that of its senseless actual plot. Eva’s actions are completely unrealistic throughout the movie. One must wonder why a woman who was portrayed as intelligent and independent—Eva was a world traveler who wrote a successful book about her adventures earlier in life—would have let a small child control and eventually ruin her life. The film is trying to make a statement about unthinking maternal love, but Eva’s masochistic actions seem inappropriate for her age and station in life.
There is similarly never any reason for Kevin’s behavior, and there is never a time when he is not acting with evil intention, not even as a baby. Thus, we are forced to believe that he was simply born bad. This unnatural, demonic element puts a cap on the potential of the film as a whole, as it turns into mere horror instead of an emotional drama. The only time in the entire film when we see Kevin looking unsure and vulnerable is in the final scene. He is about to be moved to a maximum-security prison upon turning 18 and Eva asks him why he committed his crime. The entire film is riding on this question, and his answer falls short. Because the poignancy has already been lost, this flop doesn’t ruin the climactic moment but rather reinforces the theme of nonsensical violence.
When Eva asks Kevin what is the point of collecting harmful computer viruses on CDs, he responds “There is no point. That’s the point.” This sense of destruction for destruction’s sake is the most prominent theme, and the film itself has little meaning other than the exploration of terror. With such attention devoted to talking about Kevin, it seems cheap that the film clamps shut on his psyche. With exemplary actors and a heavy plot, it is undoubtedly compelling—but more so as a well-shot thriller than as a thorough study of these characters with so much potential to psychoanalyze.

Anne E. Havinga stares entranced at a photo of two British military musicians, a portrait taken upon their return from the Crimean War in 1856. “I love their expression, the Busby hats, and the fact that the two look like they might be brothers. And you really get a sense of how young some of these soldiers were,” she says, her voice trailing off into quiet contemplation. “It’s a gorgeously rich print.”
The piece is part of a new exhibit, “Silver, Salt, and Sunlight: Early Photography in Britain and France,” that Havinga curated at the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA). The exhibition, which runs until August 5, explores subject matter and techniques of photographers in what Havinga considers the art’s “golden age,” from around 1840 to1870.
It is the opening day of the exhibit. Havinga is poised and polished, her hair arranged in a stately silver bob and her classic dark suit set off by a colorful scarf. Putting on her glasses, she starts to walk through the gallery. Visitors wander in, pausing to admire the works and pointing at images across the room. “This is an exhibition that I’ve been working on for a couple of years,” Havinga says. “This material is becoming harder to acquire as these types of photographs are getting rarer and more expensive all the time.”
She stops first at the oldest image in the exhibit, which is not actually a print but a daguerreotype made by French photographer Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey in 1842. Daguerreotyping was a laborious process that produced a fragile, beautiful single plate. Its various disadvantages—the cost of the materials, the fact that subjects were visible only from one angle, the difficulty of large-scale reproduction—encouraged photographers to switch to albumen prints, which used paper coated with egg, and salted paper prints.
“Silver, Salt, and Sunlight,” named for this next level of photographic invention, is organized into photos of people, cities, and exotic sites. In the portraiture section, Havinga pauses before a haunting image taken by Gaspard-Félix Tournachon, who also went by Nadar, of a wild-haired man clad loosely in ragged robes. “This photograph is of an eccentric street preacher who was a beloved figure in Paris,” Havinga says. “[Nadar is] clearly looking back to Baroque painting in the way he poses him.”
She moves to another image meant to capture a painterly style: Gustave le Gray’s marine vista, “Cloudy Sky—the Mediterranean with Mount Agde,” which evokes Romantic paintings. Contemporary photographers debate the extent to which they should digitally manipulate their images, but as early as the mid-19th century, photographers like le Gray were retouching their prints. “It was very difficult [for photographers] to get the tonality of both the sky and the earth,” Havinga says. “What le Gray did was take two negatives, and then he combined them. He did it in a very expert way.”
Photography today is almost universally accessible to the willing amateur, but the expense and time it required in its infancy kept photography a pastime of the privileged. “Many of these traveling photographers were well-to-do aristocrats,” Havinga says. She is looking at a photo that one such aristocrat, Gustave de Beaucorps, took of a desert camp in 1858. “I just love the peaked tents here in this oasis spot, and I love that with the long exposure the figures under the tent look like [they are] fluttering, like moths.” These images shaped the public’s conception of foreign lands, previously known to the West only through sketches and stories. “I don’t know if they inspired people to visit, but I think they inspired people to dream about places.” Havinga says. “It was like armchair traveling.”
The photos represent significant investments of labor—in addition to traveling with large glass negatives, photographers carried heavy cameras, bottles of photographic chemicals, and makeshift darkroom tents. Each negative had to be chemically prepared and treated right after exposure. “The passion and fortitude of these early photographers is incredible,” Havinga says as she contemplates a picture by Auguste-Rosalie Bisson of mountaineers scaling the Alps.
One aspect of early photography that appeals to Havinga is that great photographers are still being rediscovered. “Families in France who are selling an old estate will go through the attic and find all these old photographs,” she says. “In my career we’ve discovered many new prints, and it’s been very exciting to be a part of that.”  The museum was able to acquire some images that Havinga previously thought lost or unavailable for purchase, such as a portrait taken by author Lewis Carroll of a young girl named Alexandra. “The market for Lewis Carroll’s work goes beyond the photography market,” Havinga says. “We had thought that we had missed the boat and that there were no more out there.”
This exhibit comprises only a small sample of the MFA’s photography collection; most of it is available for art students to examine. Asked to point out a favorite image in the exhibit, Havinga shrugs and smiles contentedly at the prints surrounding her. “I love them all,” she says.

CORRECTION: Feb. 18
An earlier version of this article said that early photographers switched from daguerreotypes to glass prints and salted paper prints. In fact, they switched to albumen prints and salted paper prints.

Ludwig van Beethoven might have been rolling over in his grave as classical and opera music met pulsing electronic beats at AcousticaElectronica, a party held at OBERON last Friday. The event was presented by toUch performance art, a collective of artists led by New England Conservatory and Boston Conservatory graduate students, and it will return to OBERON this Friday. A mesmerizing blend of classical and electronic music, AcousticaElectronica featured live instrumentalists playing alongside a set from The WIG, a New York-based DJ who draws inspiration from world music. Professional dancers performed acrobatic and sensual routines as they weaved in and out of the crowd, while event-goers looked on admiringly and did some dancing of their own. The Roving Reporter stopped by to check the freshness of the beats and smoothness of the grooves.
Colin P. Thurmond, producer of AcousticaElectronica and artistic director of toUch performance art
RR: What was your inspiration for putting together such an interesting show?
CPT: This idea came about between two friends and me who met at the New England Conservatory. I mean, we’re the iPod generation—I listen to house and trance all the time, and I wanted to combine that with my traditional training. This event was about putting two worlds together that make no sense together, about the past talking to the present. It’s past, present, and future all at once.
RR: Amazing. What kind of traditional training do you have?
CPT: I’ve been playing classical guitar since I was nine, and I’m currently a doctoral student at the New England Conservatory.
RR: Would you say that you’re a classical music scholar?
CPT: I wouldn’t say I’m specifically a classical music scholar. I’m a music scholar; I don’t think you need to slap a genre on it.
RR: So, would you call yourself a beats scholar?
CPT: Oh, man, I’d never say that in public. I will say that I enjoy feeling the beat.
RR: Don’t we all. How do you think composers like Beethoven and Bizet would have felt about this treatment of their most famous works, “Carmen” and “Moonlight Sonata?”
CPT: I think it falls halfway between sacrilegious and reverent. I think Beethoven would be rocking halls in Germany if he were alive. There is probably a classical audience that would find this abhorrent, and also some [people who] would find it innovative.
RR: Do you feel like maybe that was a bit too much Spandex in the show?
CPT: Can you ever really have too much Spandex?
RR: Touché.
Rich G. Chwastiak a.k.a. The WIG, DJ
RR: What is the inspiration for your work? It’s very interesting what you do, blending classical, traditional elements of music with very modern, electronic performances.
RGC: I’m an instrumentalist first, before I’m a DJ. I try to mix live performance with my show…. To my knowledge, no one else in the world is doing this right now with this technology. I’m always pulling all sorts of different international rhythms into my electronic dance music.
RR: What’s your goal in doing all this?
RGC: I want to reach a mainstream audience as well as those who would listen to classical music. This could bring a whole new crowd to classical music. We’re chopping the songs and remixing and restructuring, and it’s been done before but not to this degree.
RR: What do you think Bach and Beethoven would think if they could see your set?
RGC: I think they would all have an open mind. It might take them five minutes or maybe a good half hour. But once they got used to it, they’d listen and pull out the parts of their songs—like, “There’s my theme; it’s not sonata form, but compositionally it is solid music.” I feel like Beethoven would be a pretty good dancer as well.
RR: But Beethoven was deaf.
RGC: Oh, yeah, you’re right. He probably wouldn’t have known what was going on.
Vladislav V. Skobelev and Yuriy Horokhivskyy, attendees
RR: How are you two enjoying the show?
VVS: I usually like trance and house, and I love classical, so this is a perfect harmony. I’ve been in Boston for 12 years, and I’ve never seen something like this.
YH: Yes, I feel like good trance is like classical music 2.0.  It’s just so good.
RR: Is it fair to say that this DJ, The WIG, is the Yo-Yo Ma of electronic music?
YH: Yes, I would say so.
RR: I can tell you enjoy the music; what did you think of the dancers and their costumes?
VVS: The costumes were very appropriate for the music—artistic and classic.
YH: It all blended together so well as a single experience. I enjoyed it all.
RR: Do you think I would have looked good in one of those costumes?
VVS:  I think everyone would look good in one of those costumes.

“W.E.,” a new movie about a historical love story, is the confused brainchild of scriptwriter and director Madonna. You may have heard of her: singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, designer, author, philanthropist, and Kabbalist. However, there is a reason you rarely hear about her directing endeavors, and it is not because her Super Bowl performances overshadow them.
Her first directorial flop, “Filth and Wisdom”—more filth than wisdom— solidified her negative reputation for filmmaking. It is clear that she hoped to win critics back with “W.E.” but neither the big budget nor the big hopes could save this movie, an inappropriate comparison between an interesting moment in history and a modern-day flake.
Like the product of an overambitious mash-up artist, “W.E.” details the familiar affair of King Edward VIII and American divorcee Wallis Simpson, and then intersperses it again and again with an unrelated, unsympathetic scenario until what we love about the infamous tryst is utterly unrecognizable. Madonna counterposes the royal story of Edward (James D’Arcy) and Wallis (Andrea Riseborough) with a modern-day romance starring Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), a stylish but simpering New Yorker stuck in an abusive relationship.
The two plotlines have seemingly nothing in common, which is why it is bizzare that Madonna so forcefully intertwines them. The absence of plot is palpable as the film constantly shuttles between time periods. After 15 minutes, the remix becomes an unceasing headache.
If the film has any continuity it is the theme of errant violence—violence done to the characters and to the viewers—coursing through an otherwise weak script. Madonna chooses to focus on what she saw as the underreported tragic circumstances of Wallis’ life of scandal. “Everyone always talks about what he gave up to be with her, but no one ever thinks about her,” protests Wally in a whiny, flat voice. The young Wally—the unfortunate victim of a violent, deceitful husband—likes to think that the famous Wallis Simpson is watching over like a fairy godmother, despite the obvious differences in their situations.
While the original Wallis had to face a restrictive society, Wally gets roughed up and passed up by the potentially adulterous man she married, yet desperately insists on bearing his child in hopes of making him stay. It is the classic tale of delusion and female subjugation. However, other than a general theme of trials of will and resistance, it bears no resemblance to Wallis’ struggle to legitimize her love in the face of a scathing press and an inflexible monarchial tradition. Hence, Wally’s inexplicable obsession with the royal couple makes her situation look even more desperate than she already is.
As in most of her work, Madonna tries to cast this as a feminist statement against a male-dominated society. The film’s internal look at women’s silent suffering behind public scrutiny or domestic violence is ripe with potential for an immediate raw reaction, but “W.E.” kills it before it can develop into something interesting. Every scene fades into the next before any real character progress or depiction of emotional depth can gain traction. Instead of delivering any powerful lasting messages, the camera shakily skids across the surface leaving the viewers to do all that they can: watch a sort of superficial fashion show taking place.
The film is most memorable for its decadent displays of wealth and luxury, which is the currency of many period pieces. The setting of the dualistic story is a Sotheby’s auction that allows for a parade of Cartier jewelry and vintage accessories. Other highlights include the eighty-something designer dresses worn by Riseborough, who brings Wallis Simpson to life in the only talented performance in the film. Save for her acting, it will come as no surprise that the few enjoyable moments in the movie involved spontaneous bursts into sexy dance paired to incongruous pop music. That’s the Madonna we know and love! But for that we do not to trek to the big screen. YouTube will suffice.
Unfortunately, instead of embracing the real allure of the drama, its old-world glamour, Madonna feels the need to overwrite and atone for it by adding an unrelated sob story. Rather than embrace its fun-loving flirtatiousness, the film struggles to become something more—an inspirational story about finding true love, a serious documentary about uncovering truth, a life lesson about changing one’s destiny—and crashes and burns in this muddled attempt.

tick, tick...Boom!
Feb. 23-25, 7:30 p.m., Feb. 26 2:00pm, 7:30 p.m.
Adams Pool Theatre
Directed by Allen J. Macleod ’14
Produced by Sara Kantor ’14
Composer Jonathan Larson is best known for his musical “RENT,” and relatively few know of his autobiographical work “tick, tick… Boom!” The show is coming to the Adams Pool Theatre in a new HRDC production starting Feb. 23. “This play was originally a monologue that Larson himself would perform,” says director Allen J. Macleod ’14. “He would sit down at his piano at a club and speak all of the lines.”
The play deals with Jon’s struggle to find stability in his life as well as success in the musical theatre business on the eve of his 30th birthday. Even college students can relate to that scary prospect, says Macleod. “I know I am a sophomore and graduation is already terrifying.”
The theme of transitioning from one stage of life to another adds emotional potency to the musical.  “These are those formative years when students are figuring out which direction they are going to take in their lives. Although this character is 10 years older than some of the people who are going to be watching, the emotions portrayed are relatable” adds Adam J. Conner ’14, a Crimson advertising manager who plays Jon.
The show revolves around three main characters: Jon, his girlfriend Susan (Kim A. Onah ’15), and his best friend Michael (Karl C. Kopczynski ’15). All three actors are excited by the advantages a small cast provides. “You can become more intimate with each other, which leads to better acting,” says Onah. The small cast allows the actors to better understand each other and leads to more compelling performances all around.
The music this dynamic trio will be singing is eclectic. “It is definitely a rock musical as a whole, but it has many different styles.” says Vocal Music Director Ethan T. Addicott ’14. From 1950s rock à la “Grease,” to country, metal, and power ballads, the show has something for everyone. During the last number, says Addicott, “The entire band cuts out. It is just the actors singing by themselves, and you can just feel a crowd of thousands clapping to the beat. It has that power.”
With both powerful singing and an intimate cast, “tick, tick...Boom!” promises  to rock the Adams pool while still taking on some of the most common anxieties faced by Harvard students.

What does it mean to be an American, to live in a nation composed of immigrants? Family history can disappear in the face of modern assimilation, and too often, stories are lost in the rush of a new society . Novelist Alex George—himself a British immigrant to America—tackles this historical yet relevant subject matter by exploring the lives of successive generations of one family in America. Though one might have grave doubts about a British writer approaching this historical territory, George craftily weaves a tale that is quintessentially American yet surprisingly universal. “A Good American” is not just a story about immigration and a new world. It is about hope, love, and family life, far more than it is an exposé of 20th century America. While the pace of the novel drags at times—perhaps an unavoidable aspect of covering such a wide time period—George narrates all the intimacies of family life, both the mundane and the scandalous, in simple heartfelt prose that resonates deeply through its unwavering attention to the powerful connections between the characters and their own unique places in American history.
The timeless premise at first unfolds predictably: Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, girl’s parents disapprove, and the star-crossed lovers seek an escape. Yet this is where Frederick and Jette’s love story, which their grandson James narrates, differs from the cliché. The German couple pick the land of the free, America, as their means of escaping the rigid parental and societal boundaries of the early 1900s. While stereotypical images of Ellis Island and New York City abound in typical immigrant tales, George surprises the reader by veering away from traditional historical conventions to take the couple on a path less travelled. The young lovers take a ship to New Orleans, but unexpected events lead them away from the bustling city center to the small town of Beatrice, Mo. They settle there, and in a story spanning four generations, these outsiders slowly eke out a life in the Midwest. Their roots find new soil in their small town, and they soon find themselves deeply intertwined with the utterly foreign world surrounding them. “As the years wash over us and new generations march into the future, family histories are subsumed into this greater narrative,” James reflects. “We become, simply, Americans.” With George’s capable prose, this family’s personal story serves as a representation of American history; it displays their own joy and sorrow and intersects cultural milestones, including World War I, the Civil Rights Movement, and eventually an encounter with Oprah Winfrey.
Frederick devotes his life to following the advice of a kind Polish immigrant: “Go and be a good American.” He is dazzled by America, a land which, in his opinion, stands in contrast to the outdated world he left. “He loved the smell of promise that hung in the air,” George writes. “Europe, he could see now, was slowly suffocating under the weight of its own history.” This unique contrast George presents—a fresh America versus a decaying Europe—creatively emphasizes the difference between Frederick and Jette’s two worlds and the irresistible appeal their adopted homeland holds.
George’s creation of Frederick as a character is an indispensable element of the narrative, for more than any other character, Frederick embodies the message of the “American Dream”—that a person with nothing can become something through hard work and entrepreneurship. He tirelessly and patiently works his way up from being a manager at the local tavern to transforming it into a lively haven of music and entertainment, one that he eventually owns.
Yet, George’s craft lies in the fact that he neithers paints the American dream as a bed of roses nor billboards it with a cheesy “happily ever after.” Jette is forced to carve out a living as a single mother after Frederick’s death in World War I; she takes over the tavern and eventually converts it to a restaurant. As she protests against war, much to the rest of the town’s chagrin, she, too, encapsulates an American dream: to live in a country with freedom. James recalls, “My grandmother—that reluctant American—was shining a small light on our country’s freedoms.” George does not spare us the grit and vulnerability behind the dream and creates an intimacy that invites the reader to empathize with the family’s happiness and pain. This connection is true of the rest of the generations and their various joys of family, birth, and friendships that are interlaced with the heartache of loss, betrayal, and crushed hopes.
Despite this in-depth exploration of the American way of life, the novel touches on ideas and values that transcend this country alone. Music, for example, becomes more than it seems under George’s lyrical description of its ability to bring people together. From the progression of a Puccini opera, barbershop singing by James and his three brothers, or even “some young punk called Elvis Presley,” George expansively charts American pop culture. Yet music holds a deeper meaning in this novel. “Always, there was music,” George writes, as he places it in unconventionally touching scenes. It is the sigh of a lovers’ whisper as Frederick and Jette’s son attempts to serenade his girlfriend. It is the healing salve for racial divisions as a white audience applauds an African-American after a jazz concert. It is a form of solace in times of hopelessness as Frederick sings alongside Harry Truman at the piano during the war.
“My grandmother’s life had been one long opera. There had been dramas, heroes, villains, improbable plot twists, all that,” James remarks. “But most of all there had been love, great big waves of it, crashing ceaselessly against the rocks of life, bearing us all back to grace.” The novel itself unfolds with the grace and patience of an opera: there is no defined story arc,  nor obvious villain or hero, but rather a series of dramatic events, people both benevolent and selfish, and unavoidable obstacles. As a representation of the country, this story of one family of Americans  is “just a single line in this vast narrative of hope.”
A Good American” is a sweeping and affectionate story of family and the struggle of belonging, yet it is merely one of the many tales of immigrant families whose collective stories have formed the nation that exists today. From the novel’s ambitious  purpose—to chronicle the entire lives and times of one far-reaching family—emerges a timeless, resilient story of America.

“I planted myself inside you and I waited to bloom,” Techie Dimanche recites, voice crackling with emotion. “And it didn’t take me no 18 years to find out that the soil was hard and rocky and it wasn’t never going to bloom.” Dimanche, from English High school, finishes her monologue, her tone rough with desperation. Then there’s motion from below, and she adjusts her denim jacket and smiles at the wave of applause. It’s a Saturday morning, and nine high school students from schools around Boston are sitting on the edges of the stage of the Huntington Theatre of Boston University. After the girl goes back to her seat, there is silence for a few minutes as the judges in the audience scribble frantically in their notebooks. Then one of the coordinators, Naheem Garcia, nods from the side of the stage. A girl wearing a blue headscarf stands and takes Dimanche’s place, introducing herself as Halima Ibrahim.
The students, who range from grades 9 to 12, are competing in the Boston regionals of the “August Wilson Monologue Competition,” a celebration of the works of August Wilson, one of America’s most influential playwrights. In the competition, high school students recite monologues from what’s called the “Century Cycle,” a series of 10 plays by Wilson, each exploring the African-American experience in one decade of the 20th century. The event takes place in cities all over the United States, and selected finalists are sent to New York City to compete on Broadway. The nine competing today have been practicing their monologues since early autumn, when affiliates of the competition’s sponsor, True Colors Theatre Company, began to run workshops in schools around the area. Many of these students have already won school-wide monologue competitions in order to be here. Now, onstage, they move nervously in their seats—rubbing their knees, twisting to talk to the person next to them, folding and unfolding their hands in their laps. Their parents and friends watch from orchestra seating. It’s only after the moment that a student’s name is called that he or she gains complete self-possession and begins to inhabit his or her character.
Ibrahim delivers her monologue, an excerpt from the play “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.” “What I care about burning in hell?” she says. “You talk like a fool….God can kiss my ass.” There is a moment of silence before the sound of applause.
Offstage, Ibrahim is a serious young woman, but she smiles when talking about the performance. “Technically,” she says, “I’m a very religious person, and when I came across the monologue, I was skeptical. It was everything that was the opposite of me. I chose it because it is very emotionally strong. It kind of gives people the opportunity to think about what their religious views are.” Ibrahim, a junior at Snowden International School was the first runner-up in the competition, winning herself a trip to New York City along with Tyrell Joseph and Reanna Johnson.
Joseph begins his excerpt from “The Piano Lesson” with knees bent, so he is almost looking up directly into the eyes of his audience and the invisible character he is addressing. “That’s when I discovered the power of death,” he says, his voice dangerously soft. “See, a nigger that ain’t afraid to die is the worse kind of nigger for the white man. He can’t hold that power over you. That’s what I learned when I killed the cat. I got the power of death too.” Joseph—who had little acting experience before he began practicing his monologue in November—won the competition on the strength of his passionate interpretation of one of Wilson’s final plays.
A 10th grader at Codman Academy, he won his school-wide competition in December using the same monolouge from “The Piano Lesson.” He has been practicing it almost every day since, though most of the work happened in the privacy of his own home. “He only likes to practice in the shower,” his mother Francis Joseph said with a chuckle. Before the monologue competition, he also took third place in the school poetry recitation contest. Offstage, he consents to taking a few photographs, smiling shyly, with his mother and his girlfriend, before he scrambles onstage to take photos with the other contestants. His parents watch him. His mother says she is not quite sure what changes in Joseph when he is on stage.  She shrugs and smiles as he begins to fill out paperwork for his trip to New York. “I think it comes from within.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cliché is that the book is always better than the film adaptation, and this certainly holds true for “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,” which is loosely based on Jules Verne’s “The Mysterious Island,” Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Treasure Island” and Jonathan Swift’s “Gulliver’s Travels.” In this case, “loosely based” translates into randomly stealing characters, events, and objects from all three books and inserting them into a totally unrelated story. It is difficult to make a film out of glorified fanfiction, but “Journey 2” is exactly that.  In stripping its source material of any of the social criticism or detailed characterization that has won the original novels lasting acclaim, “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island” becomes a curiously hollow film, composed of superficial glances at what should be a much more compelling environment.
These flaws are evident from the film’s opening moments. “Most think the works of Jules Verne were science fiction...but Vernians know better,” drawls a dreary voice-over.  Vernians, as everyone who saw the original “Journey to the Center of the Earth: 3D” knows, are a loosely knit organization of Jules Verne fanatics who are determined to chase down the fantastic environments and creatures he described in his novels. Our hero, the teenage whiz kid Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) is one of these obsessives, and when he discovers that his grandfather Anthony (Michael Caine) has found the titular island, it’s just a hop, skip, and a jump until he and his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) try to locate it themselves. Along the way, they realize that the source material not only includes Verne’s island, but also the worlds of Stevenson and Swift.
Sadly, the critique of human nature in Jonathan Swift’s works or the ambiguous villainy of Long John Silver are absent, putting the screenwriter in the awkward position of looking as if he took “Gulliver’s Travels” literally. Even though these satirical overtones would have complicated an already muddled film, the question arises as to why the filmmakers bothered to reference Verne, Stevenson, and Swift at all: the elements they casually borrow are so distorted and subverted that they become nearly unrecognizable.  The famous Captain Nemo, for instance, is referenced often; the fact that Verne wrote him as an Indian exile crusading against the British Empire is not.  In the end, when the characters speak of Nemo or Bromdignagians or any other element taken from the source material, it comes across as little more than a name drop.
Of course, even a very loose adaptation of Jules Verne might entail some visually dazzling scenes, and there are two shots in “Journey 2” that might only be described as astonishing. The first depicts a character falling into a gigantic egg, screaming at a lizard fetus, and getting drenched in amniotic fluid. The second shows Johnson pumping his pectoral muscles and screaming at Hutcherson to “feed them” with berries.
Overall, however, “Journey 2” is an exceedingly weak attempt at a visually interesting thrill ride. As a 3D movie with an idiotic plot, it should at least have a strong sense of environment. Instead, it’s a film that doesn’t bother to define any of its various locales; it simply moves from one to the next at an absurdly rapid pace. Though the relentless forward motion mainly serves to hinder the audience from fully appreciating each setting, it has other distinctly negative effects on the dialogue.
Although the acting is generally passable, the performances are deeply diminished by this fast-paced script, which seems like it was written according to the first rule of improvisation: always say yes. For example, when the characters first land on the island’s beach, they almost immediately discover a cave, which immediately gives them reason to enter it. There is never a second thought or objection raised to recklessly rushing willy-nilly across these dangerous environs. Scarcely any time has passed in the jungle—they already have left the cave—before the characters run to a makeshift tree house, and almost immediately after that they walk over to an ancient city.
Indeed, it’s difficult to see where “Journey 2” might have gone right. The writing and general atmosphere are deeply subpar, and the actors don’t deliver performances that could elevate the film out of the realm of pulp.  Perhaps its near-total failure may be the film’s eventual salvation; it is not impossible that the film should become a midnight movie and ascend to the level of high camp.
But that is in the future.  Now, “Journey 2” is nothing but shallow and shoddy.

If you lived in the world of “The Flame Alphabet,” this book review could kill you. The novel opens in the midst of a language apocalypse, in which parents fall deathly ill from the speech of their inexplicably immune children. Author Ben Marcus explores the devastating story of a couple’s struggle with their carcinogenic daughter, alongside the far more complex topic of language as a barrier to religious experience. Despite some strange plot twists, “The Flame Alphabet” is a welcome break from the established dystopian novel: It is alien and complex but sacrificies none of its beautiful turns of phrase for overly scientific descriptions.
Writers of dystopian fiction usually focus on a step-by-step compilation of technical differences between our world and the brave, new one. In contrast, “The Flame Alphabet” uses as little explanation as possible. In most examples of the genre, the setting usually lies in the future so that the reader can fear the coming of a new world, and thus there are countless new technologies that the author can relish in describing—whether Orwell’s “Newspeak” or Bradbury’s wall-to-wall television sets. However, this often leads to a lack of authenticity in character interactions, as the author cogently explains device after device in order to effectively describe the world rather than the characters that move within it. Marcus’ new novel does not patronize the reader in the same way. The first page refreshingly begins with an unexplained description of Samuel’s strange sound-defense first-aid kit—filled with felt, pills, and salts—that he packs when fleeing the deathly voice of his young daughter Esther.
The numerous medical formulas—disparagingly called “painting the insides”—along with the sketchy recommendations of a mysterious expert “Le Bov” lend a foreign quality that permeates the entire novel. As language deteriorates, so does the sharing of information, and Marcus thus creates momentum as the reader knows little about the nature of the disease but more about the protagonist’s overwhelming love for his daughter.
These powerful emotions control much of the narrative focus of the novel. This beginning feels Kafkaesque in that it seems highly strange and cruel for a grown man to sneak away in fear of his young daughter, yet Marcus writes from the perspective of someone whose deviance from the societal norms of our world is self-substantiated. Cognitive dissonance exists only in the mind of the reader, not of the character, as Sam views his departure as merely the next logical step in preserving his life. Marcus explains this wild emotional reaction well, as he meticulously reveals the horrors of the months leading up to the moment where Sam picks up everything and flees. The dialogue is filled initially with the vitriol between Esther—an angst-filled teenager who displays a complete disregard for the impact of language in her interactions with her parents—and Sam, whose language is weak and obliging. His wavering barricade of silence against his daughter is emotional and heartbreaking, as well-written as it is grotesque. He can only love her from afar while he watches his wife Claire collapse from the disease caused by the sheer sound of Esther’s voice.
However, the novel falters when Marcus’ considerable research of Jewish mysticism dominates the action. Sam and Claire both belong to a sect called “Forest Jews,” who listen to the opaque musings of a rabbi through radio wires in the earth in their “Jew Hole.” Besides the dubious connection between Sam’s ability to survive in the new world and the actual Jewish tradition of not converting others—a technique that would invariably involve language—the paranoiac feeling of persecution could have been maintained just as well by the roving bands of children screaming in the streets.
The latter part of the novel is where Marcus truly differentiates “The Flame Alphabet” from other dystopian novels. Sam eventually begins research on creating an alphabet that test subjects can use without dying. It is a wonderful exercise in frustration—and Marcus’s authorial creativity—as Sam explores hundreds of different ways to get around the disease that plagues society. Marcus embellishes this sort of technical detail with the growing disappearance of Sam’s need for language in his new life and creatively imagines a community of similarly silent adults who do not gesture or think; there, Sam develops his own form of prayer. The angst present in the beginning of the book  washes away with Sam’s singular goal of creating a new language that won’t hurt so much.
“The Flame Alphabet” would be a philosopher’s apocalypse, but it works well when Marcus devotes so much of the book to linguistic loopholes, keeping the universal emotions center stage. However, Marcus did not need to make a novel with such a strange starting concept overly obscure and far-fetched. As an exercise in futuristic creativity, Marcus’ novel triumphs. A world without language where the inner thoughts of a man are on display is a world fascinating enough, though, without the interspersions of magic realism that distract greatly from the action at hand.

Teake ’12 is a Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentrator in Kirkland House with an affinity for performance arts. He is currently a member of Harvard’s nascent spoken word group, Speak Out Loud, which was founded by Cassandra E. Weston ’14 and Kyra A. Atekwana ’14. Teake has been creating original pieces for two years and considers spoken word a verbal equivalent to martial arts.  Teake performed with Speak Out Loud at Harvard’s annual celebration of the life and message of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., marking the first time that spoken word poetry was performed inside of Memorial Church.
 The Harvard Crimson: Why spoken word?
Teake: It’s hip, you know? It’s like poetry, but its also got this rhythmic, musical feel to it. It’s open ended—there’s no one thing that spoken word is. As opposed to written poetry, it’s not just about the content. It’s also about how you deliver it—you can evoke a certain response from people in the moment. I came to it from Wushu, which is performance martial arts. I’ve been doing that since I was 10, and there’s a group here on campus…so I’ve been on stage a lot.  I really like that performance feel. And then I found spoken word, and there are a lot of transferable skills. From being on stage with the swords and doing flips to being on stage doing verbal acrobatics, I like the live performance element­—excitement.
 THC: Speak Out Loud is relatively new on campus. How did it start up?
T: It was the initiative of two current sophomores, Kyra and Cassandra. I heard about it through Optional Winter Activities Week (OWAW) programming. I saw that these two [then] freshmen were putting on this spoken word workshop. I went over there, checked it out, and I could see that they had…a lot of interest. It was last spring when they created a club...Now it’s officially recognized, and they have funding and faculty recognition. It’s really taken off over one year.
 THC: Did you do spoken word before joining Speak Out Loud?
T: I started two summers ago. I had kind of known what it was—I remember being younger and my sister told me to watch “Def Poetry Jam.” I was 10 or 11. I didn’t know what was going on. I went back a few years ago and saw some of those old clips, and they made a lot more sense to me. It was interesting. Spoken word existed on campus before—there were [some] isolated efforts. What Kyra and Cassandra did was bring that together into a cohesive group so there’s a central space for people to gather.
 THC: Is there a constant theme in your pieces?
T: Things always are changing over time. I’m always listening to other artists. I just try [to] spend as much time as I can going to different live events and feed off [of] other people and ideas. Some common themes are issues...of identity, race, gender, and class. I try to have a message in there, some theme of social justice, but at the same time not be so pedantic about it or sort of in your face with the message. There are themes throughout, but at the same time, it’s also all about having a good time and making sure people are excited to hear [the poetry]. It’s a balance.
 THC: What’s the writing process like for a spoken word piece?
T: Chaotic. The most fun thing this semester that I’ve been doing is [working] on group pieces, which are always interesting because you can’t open a textbook and be like, “Okay, this is how you start writing a piece.This is what you do first.”  Everyone has their own way…. Every time it’s different.  Meeting up with other people is always interesting because your styles…might clash a little bit.  It’s always an experiment trying to figure out what you’re going to do. It’s always trial and error. You want something to come together organically, whether you’re working in a group or by yourself. You give me a prompt and I’m not going to sit down and [say] “Do this, this and that.” Things just come together and you’re just really thankful [for] how it turns out. Hopefully.
 THC: Do see yourself doing spoken word for the rest of your life?
T: I definitely would like to keep going with performance in some degree, but I prefer to try different genres and be versatile, to open up horizons [and] reach different audiences. There’s the martial art, the spoken word, and also some musical stuff I’ve been doing.  I’ve been collaborating with people who play instruments [and] trying to connect [music and poetry to] reach different people with a different sound. I’ll keep going with it, but I’ll also keep trying different things.

One evening during reading period, on a night my GPA will never forget, one of my blockmates asked me a simple question: “Have you ever heard of Smogon University?”
Though the name suggests a sketchy, get-your-degree-in-four-months-for-an-absurdly-inflated-price sort of institution, it turns out that Smogon University is an online community devoted to competitive Pokémon battling. I thought I knew all there was to know about Pokémon. You catch these cute yet strange little critters (which can eventually become very large critters), and you use attacks based on whatever your opponent’s weaknesses are. Most of these tactics are pretty obvious: water beats fire, fire beats grass, and so on. Its supersedes tic-tac-toe in intellectual sophistication—but just barely.
I quickly learned that I really didn’t know anything about Pokémon. Have you ever tried to optimize your Pokémon’s EVs and base nature? Have you ever made sure your team had a good balance of walls, revengers, and offenders? What about defending against Rain Dance, Baton Pass, and Endeavor teams? I hadn’t either.
Within a few hours of my introduction to Smogon Univeristy, I was knee-deep in the knitty gritty of Pokémon battle strategies. It was impressive, in a frightening way, just how much there was on this site. The Strategy Pokédex was “The Art of War” for Pokémon, ten times over. There was a newsletter featuring Sports Illustrated-style tournament coverage and strategic analyses done by “6A9 Ace Matador,” who appears to be the Bobby Fischer of Pokémon.
Some “students” at Smogon had even gotten together to write a free online Pokémon-battling simulator. “Shoddy Battle” let you pick whatever Pokémon you wanted, assign them various stat values and items, and jump straight into battling. And, oh God, this was the trap. Free. Online. Strategy game. Offering something like that to a computer science concentrator and strategy game junkie is like offering a recovering methhead a free eight-ball.
I ended up staying up embarrassingly late that night, scrawling notes to myself in pursuit of crafting the perfect team. The choices were endless, agonizing, and thrilling: Do I lead with Infernape or Celebi? Should I opt for a weather-based team or not? I can’t say why the more obvious and pressing question—“Why am I taking notes on Pokémon at two in the morning?”—never occurred to me.
When I finished crafting my team, I logged onto the Smogon server with all the excitement of a doe-eyed debutante. I had done my background reading, my team was perfect, and I was going to be Lord Empress of Pokémon by the end of the night. And I proceeded to get completely destroyed in my first battle. The match was over in three minutes, and I hadn’t even put a dent in any of my opponent’s Pokémon.
I started another game, and I lost even quicker. To add insult to injury, this time I fell victim to a Clefairy, one of the pinkest, most cuddly, most harmless looking Pokémon. Ultimately, then, the collective might of a bunch of Pokéaficionados far outweighs one eager little Harvard student pulling an all-nighter just to see how well her shiny new Pokémon team does.
And yet despite this brutal initiation, I was hooked. There is a certain nostalgic charm to the whole idea of competitive Pokémon; it is enjoyable now because it was enjoyable then. Although it’s essentially chess on steroids with sound effects and bright colors, it’s sustained by an affable collective of gamers who still love those silly little Pokémon games. It is as much a source of pride to take an exam at Harvard as it is to fight a great battle at Smogon, and it’s equally thrilling to be a part of that online community—except for that one guy who called me a “n00b fgt” when I finally won my first game.

Foodie. The term evokes many characteristics: elitism, snobbery, obsession, gluttony. But the gourmets of today remain separate from their historical counterparts of a century ago, and the difference now is in the accessibility and democratization of both knowledge about food production and culinary innovation.
Today, the term foodie describes a way of thinking rather than a way of acting. A foodie is someone committed to increasing his or her knowledge about food and—in this era—someone who sees food as art that can be produced by ordinary people rather than by a culinary elite. In the 1550s and onward, the higher classes of England spent their wealth commissioning artists to create large sugar sculptures. Whereas this increasingly cheap commodity only became the primary source of energy for the masses later in the industrial era. It is clear to see how the idea of food as art became tied to notions of elitism and excess. But the foodies of today are of the postmodern era. They, of the internet age, demand information disseminated through a non-hierarchical network. When choosing a food item, they ask: What is its source? What are the ingredients? And who controls the means of production? They reject the authority of large corporations, such as McDonald’s, who reproduce foods based on standardization—a mere focus on the final product rather than the production  process. The plated food is only one part of the story—even the high-end French restaurant is suspect for the modern foodie.
But foodies demand more than accessible information about food production. In addition to rejecting corporate hegemony, they shirk culinary tradition in favor of innovation. They want creativity. This challenge for the contemporary food artist is open to everyone. This is how Spain has taken France’s place as the global center of food innovation. After the abandonment of the Nouvelle Cuisine movement in France in the 1990s, Spain became the world’s culinary hotspot, leading The New York Times to dub it the “new France.” This new Spanish cuisine arose not from years of traditional, fundamentals-based cooking—as customary in French cuisine—but rather, as one of the world’s leading chefs, Ferran Adrià, has said, from “anarchy.”
We see this across the globe. For foodies, challenging traditional ideas and fostering individual creativity are at the forefront of their movement. From Adrià’s high-end—and currently closed but soon to be transformed—Spanish restaurant elBulli to the Boston-based artisanal Grillos’ Pickles, started by an amateur without any previous experience in the food industry, innovation is paramount.
But you don’t need a big wallet to seek authenticity. The best bar in the country, as rated by Drinks International, is hidden inside a hot dog stand in New York City. Even something as small-scale as starting a personal garden is to be admired in the foodie world. Spending a Saturday making jars of jam from one’s own strawberries is not only cheaper than the store-bought alternative, but it allows the eater to be creative. The more we know about food, the more boundless its innovation.
In addition to creating a space for individual creativity in the making of food, the foodie philosophy fosters community through collective discourse. The movement for local food sourcing has its merits for environmentalism, but as a philosophy, it can also revolutionize how we relate to food production and to each other. We can start to buy from local artisans rather than from agribusinesses like Sysco Corporation. Indeed, there is something immensely satisfying about creating a dialogue through exchanging home-brewed beers with a fellow foodie.
Sometimes food is just something we eat. But food can be art; it can be creativity; it can be inspiring; and it can be inspired. We can recognize value in food beyond the mere palate­­—as a full sensory experience, as an expression of human ingenuity and play, and as something that fosters community. At its best, food can become the platform for rejecting the marketed messages of mass consumption produced by large corporations. Rather than just allowing you to taste in new ways, it can allow you to think in new ways.
More than ever, engagement with food as a cultural creation is available to everyone. Haute cuisine need not be defined by elites, nor should it be. And control of our food system is no longer monopolized by the Hostesses and Monsantos. Now a new generation of young farmers are staking their claims to this system of production and distribution as well.
Obsession can be unhealthy in any form, but increased knowledge about food, its nutrition, its production, and its sourcing—these speak of a postmodern information structure focused on sharing rather than hierarchy. Adrià made no profit from elBulli, but how many great artists profit from their great art? The value of art in the postmodern era has been in its ability to challenge norms and project new ways of thinking. As we continue to push the boundaries against conventional cuisine and food production, we reaffirm our own individual artistic and democratic potential.

“There is only one Wynton, and his presence is both refined and sublime,” said Henry L. Gates Jr. as he introduced Pulitzer Prize-winning jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis on Thursday night at Sanders Theatre. The program, “Meet Me at the Crossroad,” was part of a two-year lecture series given by Marsalis entitled “Hidden in Plain View: Meanings in American Music.” In his three-hour lecture, Marsalis expansively mapped out the evolution of American identity through an articulate exploration of root American music featuring blues, folk, gospel, bluegrass, and jazz. With various musical illustrations played by Marsalis and other distinguished musicians, the lecture charmed a packed Sanders Theater and provided a rich history of the American root genres and the musicians who explored them.
“Identifying the blues should be part of any American citizenship test,” Marsalis jokingly said as he explained the significance of the blues towards the progression of American music.
“It was interesting to see how the blues and different genres come together and how he disaggregated jazz into its various components,” Michael O’Leary ’12 said. According to Marsalis, the blues, a quintessentially American genre, transcends socio-economic and racial divisions. With its universal themes and simple song structure, blues “spoke deeply on issues without too much artifice and provided a structural simplicity that enabled all other musicians to easily play together,” Marsalis said. Whereas the music of traditional European countries was an aristocratic privilege, the blues instead sought “cross-pollination as an important step in achieving a more inclusive and complex musical language.” Its combination of Anglo-Celtic and Afro-American cultures aptly symbolized the American melting pot.
Marsalis progressed from analyzing musical forms to paying homage to various legendary American musicians. Through his lecture, he touched upon many revolutionary artists, from Thomas Dorsey, who “wrote the nastiest secular songs ever written”, to Bessie Smith, “the master of metaphor.” Marsalis narrated how these musicians paved the way for unity during a time of segregation through harmony, melody, and rhythm. One artist who struggled to break past the hypocritical bonds on American freedom was Benny Goodman, who integrated his bandstand in the 1930s. “At that time, it was an incredibly bold move, but Benny chose to respond to what he heard in American music ... It was obvious to him, it was obvious because those root styles bespoke a unified America,” Marsalis said. And while the 1950s were shadowed with the strife and suspicion of McCarthyism, the advent of rock and roll connected youths all over the country. “It exposed black teenagers to the Anglo foundations of all American root music,” Marsalis elaborated. Rock and roll, spearheaded by a fiery young Mississippian named Elvis Presley, introduced “white kids to music and dance and all kids to the meaning of the American experience.” When the nation grappled with the question of civil rights in the 1950s and ’60s, musicians had already paved the way.
However, towards the end of the lecture, it became apparent that Marsalis was critical of the way music has progressed since the late 1950s. Music became “more about the personality and charisma of the star, more about spectacular action, more about movies and drugs and being in power, than the identity of any music,” he said. He attributed this decline in part to the current lack of music education in public schools and the commercialization of music. Newer genres, according to Marsalis, have strayed too far from American root music and lack an organic rhythm, which is the democratic heart and soul of all music. “Our music, genetically engineered to bring us together, became the principal tool to keep us apart,” he lamented.
At its heart, the lecture resonated as a call for musicians to turn back to their cultural roots. “In American culture, we often come to think of the crossroads as a place of crucial determining, of even fatal choices, a place ridden with separation,” Professor Gates said while explaining the lecture’s title. Yet Gates argues that in some African, neo-African, and African-American narratives, the crossroads signifies the opposite: “It is the site of the exploration of unlimited possibilities, not of predetermination or predestination.” Marsalis’s lecture aspired to prove that countless musicians have met at the crossroads of American root music, pioneered brilliant artistic creations, and taken the path toward greater social change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s frustrating when the artistic merits of a piece are secondary to the type of language used to express it. This sense of dissatisfaction applies to the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Patrick Hamilton’s “Rope.” However, something simple and quiet lies at the edge of this production, directed by Sarah M. Batista-Pereira ’13 and finishing its run Feb. 16 to 18 at the Loeb Ex. The beauty of Pereira’s “Rope,” even as it stumbles occasionally over an imperfect script and imprecise pacing, lies in its ability to express deeper themes without drowning in the overwrought dialogue. The production’s strenghs are only allowed to shine through when it is unhindered by Hamilton’s original script.
“Rope” is probably most famous for having inspired the eponymous Hitchcock film, which is in fact very different from Hamilton’s 1929 play. The comedy is a dark one. It is a dramatic re-envisioning of the Leopold and Loeb murder of 1924, in which two brilliant young men, obsessed with the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, attempts to prove their superiority by committing the perfect crime: the murder of Loeb’s cousin Bobby Franks. Wyndham Brandon (Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14) and Charles “Granno” Granillo (Eduardo J. Perez-Torres ’12), two university undergraduates and lovers, murder fellow student Ronald Kentley and stuff his body into a chest. In appropriately grisly, if not hospitable, spirit, the murderers then invite the victim’s friends Leila (Virginia R. Marshall ’15) and Raglan  (Jeremy Y. Venook ’15) as well as Kentley’s father (Taylor A. Cressler ’14), for a seemingly normal dinner party—directly over the dead man’s body. It’s surprisingly cheery stuff until the quiet intellectual Rupert (Jacob A. Brandt ’14) begins to unravel Brandon and Granillo’s carefully laid plans.
Granillo is forever melancholic, and Perez-Torres’ performance is true to that character and admirably consistent. But—and this is really a structural problem—Granillo’s complicity in the murder does not line up with his introverted, regretful character, who acts as a foil to his partner’s domineering and vociferating personality. How this sense of conflict is expressed does not make sense given the setting of the production. For example, during the dinner, Granillo’s dark, introverted exclamations while he plays piano only intrude on the party without adding anything in particular to the performance or the development of his character.
To be fair, the book itself struggles most with the amount of conflicting energies present onstage at any moment: Brandon’s outbursts—again a problem with the script, not the production—are excessive, and the friends Leila and Raglan’s beautiful yet useless prating weaken the farce inherent in the show. The dialogue seems deliberately superficial, with more exuberant gesturing than necessary. The unfortunate result is that the nuanced performances lose their impact as they get lost in the overly wordy script.
The maid Sabot (Nancyrose Houston ’15) who lurks in the background is a brilliant model and moderator of tempo and tone. It’s more to Houston’s credit than Hamilton’s, probably: her character was onstage far less than the exemplary acting demanded. Nevertheless, her single exchange with Brandt, played by both actors with engrossing restraint, provides some of the play’s most genuine and provocative dialogue. Questions of unspoken pathos begin to take focus, however, Hamilton’s script seems not to have bothered answering these questions, which end up, unfortunately, becoming anomalous and superfluous.
The cast and crew of “Rope” work their most stunning theatrical artistry when they move beyond Hamilton’s script. Set Designer Jessica X. Zuo ’13 transforms a bland set by her attention to details, such as the inscrutably anachronistic squiggles of white snaking over a fairly unimportant painting hanging on the wall. Lighting designer Hannah R. Phillips ’15 uses a hint of churchly light illuminating the coffin/chest in the dim opening scene. This one detail beautifully evokes the show’s symbolism of light and dark. All of these moments communicate more of the production’s central themes than the Hamilton’s book does. “Rope” works best when the actors are freed from the overwrought script. Wordless murmurs of aggression in the plod of Rupert’s cane as he begins to unearth the crime say more than Hamilton’s verbose dialogue. The production succeeds when these simple aesthetics are deliberately, but subtly, engaged.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bad classical piano performances usually fall into two categories: either the performance is laden with so much unnecessary melodrama and arm-flailing hysteria that it is completely impossible to take seriously, or it is so buttoned-up and stiff that audience members are checking their watches or fast asleep. In order to command the attention and respect of the audience, performers must strike a balance between these extremes. On Tuesday night at Boston Conservatory’s Seully Hall, that is exactly what Janice Weber did. Her ambitious program was performed with a professionalism that never reached sterility and a passion that never reached schmaltz—in essence, she made her concert all about the music.
Central to Weber’s successful performance was a brilliantly organized set list. As Weber notes in the program, 2012 marks the 100th anniversary of John Cage’s birth and the 150th anniversary of Claude Debussy’s. “Their legacies changed the course of 20th-century music,” she wrote, “and I am honored to include them in tonight’s program.” Given this homage, it would have seemed likely for Weber to pull from the most well-known pieces of each composer’s canon, but she instead opted to bring out two of the composers’ less prominent works: “Estampes” by Debussy and the piano score for Cage’s ballet “The Seasons.”
Though the program was a tribute to these two legends, there was also another thread running between its selections. Weber bookended the concert with Liszt pieces, opening with “Two Legends” and closing with the legendary “Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.” As she explained in the notes for the latter, “Liszt’s 200th birthday year has just passed and it is worth noting that, one way or another, every piece on this program can trace its roots to the peerless master.”
The program included pieces by Rachmaninoff and César Franck, both of whom were significantly influenced by Liszt. These selections added further evidence  that Weber chose her pieces not only to showcase her talents but also to make a deeper point—in this case, to show the pervasive influence of Liszt throughout his lifetime and far beyond.
Of course, this conceptual framework wouldn’t mean anything if Weber didn’t have the chops and the sensibility to perform the pieces well. In this respect she left almost nothing to be desired. The opener, “Two Legends,” was fast and crisp in its first movement, and in its dark and heavy second movement she made its five simultaneous lines spread out all over the keyboard look like a warm-up. For such a technically challenging piece, Weber was largely devoid of bravado; she swayed with the music and let an occasional smile cross her face, but her aura was one of control rather than of release.
However, Weber’s reserve did not make the performance unexciting or uninteresting. “Estampes” is more informed by visual textures, such as pagodas in Asia and a summer evening in Spain, than it is by emotional experiences. She took some risks in her rendition, pushing and pulling the tempo in ways that in excess would have weakened Debussy’s impressionistic intentions. And her performance of César Franck’s “Prelude, Chorale, and Fugue” was anything but reserved; she played with a romantic intensity fitting for the time period in which the piece was written.
John Cage’s discordant ballet “The Seasons” was perhaps the program’s riskiest item. The piece, like all Cage, is cerebral in its construction. The length of the nine movements are proportioned in the same ratio as the piece’s internal rhythmic patterns: 2-2-1-3-2-4-1-3-1. In addition to being rhythmically awkward, the piece is harmonically bizarre and could have easily alienated the audience. But Weber played with such grace and motion to make it danceable, which is quite a feat considering its rhythmic and harmonic irregularities.
Weber closed with a virtuosic flourish. In Rachmaninoff’s “Variations on a Theme by Corelli,” she wandered through its 20 variations with focus and incredible technical proficiency. And in the finale, “Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2,” she brought a lightness and a subtlety that too often are absent from musicians who look at Liszt and see only weight and bombast.
Weber’s concert was equal parts maturity and passion, thought and emotion, restraint and release.  As she played, it became apparent that her body language was merely in reaction to the music produced by her hands—she didn’t need to exaggerate her movements or her expression in order to show the audience what it was supposed to be feeling. She let the music speak for her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Women, gender, and sexuality studies concentrator Iman E. James ’12 is writing her thesis about porn. Granted, it focuses on the erotic writings of Georges Bataille and Anaïs Nin rather than the history of Hustler centerfolds, but James still identifies pornography as the subject of her work. James harbors no qualms about this. She considers pornography to be a serious art form that can address the same issues that more respected forms examine. For her, pornography is much more than a graphic means to a crude end. Her ideas about the aesthetics of pornography may not be shared by the general populace or even a discernable portion of Harvard students. “There’s not a huge community I can point to that talks about stuff like this,” James says. However, the Harvard community does not shy away from issues of sexuality in its artistic ventures.
It would be disingenuous to say that Harvard University is home to a thriving subculture of art that focuses on sex, but that’s only because the varieties of sex-based art at Harvard aren’t nearly as organized or stylistically similar as the word “subculture” implies. Indeed, there is an impressive amount of art about sex at Harvard. This incongruity stems from the fact that much of Harvard’s sexual art remains unseen, with exception of some works that engage with the subject tangentially. Interestingly, this lack of broad popular appeal seems to stem from the circumstances surrounding the creation of this art rather than any public or administrative bias against sexual content.
UNDER THE COVERS
Abby P. Sun ’13 and Samantha A. Meier ’12 have an acute sense of the magnitude of sexually focused art at Harvard, which makes sense given their roles as the organizers of Sex Week at Harvard. Sex Week, which begins on March 25, is designed to provide cohesion to the variety of workshops and events regarding sex issues on campus. Though not explicitly concerned with art, Sex Week will include some artistic events, including a public art display outside of the Science Center. Sun and Meier consider the material not only artistically valid but also of social importance.
“I think a lot of times people tend to think of art as depoliticized in some way or that the art community here at Harvard is disengaged from any advocacy,” Sun says. Examples such as Nayeli E. Rodriguez ’10’s “SEX, America”— a show that used materials from sex education classes to comment on the evolution of ideas about national views on sex—clearly contradict this view.
Sun and Meier describe a surprising range of the work they described. Some pieces, like Rodriguez’s, involved curation rather than creation. Others took a distinctly more hands-on approach. Sun and Meier recalled that several years ago, a student in the VES department tried to make a pornographic film as a thesis. What united all these efforts, aside from their sexual content, was the minimal exposure the final products received in the Harvard community.
Meier compares the obscurity of these works to the events that Sex Week is attempting to centralize. “I would say this sort of work tends to be under the radar…. [They] existed and people knew about them, but I wouldn’t say that the “general Harvard populace knows about them,” Meier says.
However, Meier attributes this to the circumstances of their creation; these works are generally produced in Visual and Environmental Studies classes and rarely exit that environment. “I think they tend to be kept in the arts community they’re produced in,” Meier says.
These sentiments were shared by Rodriguez. Though her thesis was unique for its curatorial approach, it was not well attended, as she readily admits. “It wasn’t underground, but it definitely wasn’t popular,” Rodriguez says. Like Meier, Rodriguez does not feel that this was due to the work’s sexual content. “Nobody had any problem who attended the show or advised the show or anything. If anything, they were interested even more just because it had a catchy title,” Rodriguez says. “[The low attendence] was partly a function of the budget I had to do marketing or promotion.” Ultimately, the visibility of the show was weakened not by its controversial subject matter but by administrative issues.
PASSION PIT
The most conspicuous intersection of art and sex at Harvard takes place onstage. When Sun and Meier listed Harvard artistic projects that focused on sex, the first thing they thought of was an HRDC production: this past fall’s “Spring Awakening” at the Oberon. There is a great deal of sex in  Harvard theater: Peter Shaffer’s ‘Equus” and Sarah Kane’s “Cleansed” were both produced last spring, in some way engage with sex. Some HRDC directors believe that theater and sex are intextricably linked.
“[Sex] is one of those perennial themes that always keeps popping up in Harvard theater. There are always going to be plays that deal with sex. Frankly, a lot of very well-written and interesting plays are about these subjects, because they’re very relatable facets of the human experience,” says Matt C. Stone ’11, a former HRDC director and Crimson arts editor. Several of the plays that Stone directed at Harvard—in particular, “Cleansed” and Jean Genet’s “The Balcony”—serve as notable examples. Though both of the plays take a darker view of sexual relations, “relatability”  is a very plausable reason for sex’s appeal to playwrights and, in turn, for Harvard productions.
Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts editor who is directing Ella Hickson’s “Hot Mess” this semester, says that the play attracted him due to its contemporary look at love and sexuality. “It deals with emotions that affect people of my age. It’s about how it feels to be 24, 25—still exploring what it means to be in love or have sex,” McTaggart says.
This relevancy may be one of the reasons why these plays are attended by students, but it doesn’t necessarily distinguish the plays from their less visible counterparts in the VES department. Rather, the biggest difference lies in the way the theatrical productions use sex; instead of focusing on sex in and of itself, these plays use it to discuss other issues.
The play’s suggestive disclaimer on the HRDC website perhaps alludes that “Hot Mess” contains copious amounts of sex. But when asked about the play’s use of sex, he bristled a bit. As it turns out, the disclaimer wasn’t as subtle as the play itself. “It’s not a play about sex, but it’s a play that involves sex,” McTaggart says. Though he acknowledges that the play contains many sexual elements, McTaggart ultimately feels it was more distinctive for its frank treatment of ideas surrounding sex—the reality of falling in love and maintaining relationships.
The idea of a play involving but not dealing exclusively with sex, however, is important.  In many HRDC productions, sex is not so much the subject of the work as a tool. “[Sex] is a physical way of embodying and performing love, and I think that’s most often how it’s treated in [‘Cleansed’],” Stone says. “To me, it’s more a play about love than sex.”
Yet this tool also contains the potential for abuse. Though sex is the basis for a number of great plays, as Stone notes, not all works engage with the topic in a substantial manner. For this reason, student directors must take pains to avoid exploitation in shows that involve sex. These concerns are especially important for Katherine L. Price ’14, the director for HRDC’s spring production of “Hair.” Upon its Broadway premiere in 1968, the musical’s use of nudity caused much controversy and is still one of the most salient aspects of “Hair.” “People can use [nudity] to create more of a spectacle,” Price says. “I’m pretty much going to let my cast decide what they’re comfortable with.” Though Price considers the nudity in “Hair” an important part of the play’s ’60s philosophy, she acknowledges that elements such as nudity may be overused. “It’s done a lot at Harvard, which is why I’m tentative about it in ‘Hair,’” Price says. “I think at Harvard we all want to do something different, so oftentimes people want to do the most daring pieces, which typically involve nudity.”
McTaggart agrees that nudity can be overused, noting that full frontal nudity is not the only or the best way to represent sexual intimacy onstage. “Hot Mess” will only feature a brief moment of partial nudity. “It’s not a prudish thing, just a poetic thing,” McTaggart says.
ABSTRACT SEX
McTaggart and Stone’s opinions create the impression that sex’s universality is what makes it such a durable subject. However, Patrick W. Lauppe ’13, fiction editor of The Harvard Advocate and a Crimson arts editor observes that many of the short stories published in The Advocate make use of a distinctive sort of sex. “Lots of our pieces tend to be about incest for some reason,” Lauppe says. “It just comes up a lot.”
Lauppe’s insight may have some depressing implications about the sexual habits of Harvard students. However, Lauppe made it clear that the incest was employed not to evoke familiarity but to challenge accepted norms. “It’s focusing on deviancy as a theme,” Lauppe says. “They’re [ironically using] the classical model of the love story or the love poem by focusing on something that would be recognized as sexual deviancy.”
Lauppe connects this usage of incest in The Advocate to greater trends in both modern and postmodern literature; in these forms, deviant sexuality has been employed as a way to challenge societal norms. Indeed, this method of provocation has even surfaced in artistic projects at Harvard—namely, James’ thesis on pornography. “Pornography is a way of potentially challenging what we’re used to. It can confront someone with the things they’re scared of, and it provokes self-analysis,” James says. This is particularly true for Bataille, a French surrealist and Marxist author, who James considers as one of the main figures in her thesis. Bataille’s erotica is transgressive, exploring the breaking of societal norms in shocking and explicit ways. His writing frequently examined the complex relationship between sex and death, a theme that comes up in one of the short stories James is writing for the creative aspect of her thesis.
This short story, which is modeled on the aesthetics of pornography James observes in Nin and Bataille’s work, is particularly interesting because of how it displays another element of pornographic writing: a distinct attention to subjectivity. In James’ story, this is emphasized by the fact that some of the sexual episodes take place during dreams; the characters’ carnal experiences are the product of their own consciousness.
For English professor Matthew B. Kaiser, who teaches English 154: “Literature and Sexuality,” this subjectivity associated with erotica is practiced by many contemporary authors. “Because modern literature is invested in representing the machinations of modern subjectivity to readers, and because sex is so central to modern subjectivity, it therefore follows that representing sex is at the heart of so much of modern literature,” Kaiser wrote in an email.
For Lauppe, the stylistic implication of this subjectivity is the reason sexually focused writing rarely appears in The Advocate. “There’s a precedent set by post-World War II writers like John Updike to use the sex scene as the place where you really deal with extended subjectivity and put into practice modernist techniques where they elsewhere might be frowned upon. Heavy experimentation and even egotistical stylization can occur,” Lauppe says. “But The Advocate isn’t really looking for modernist projects.”
Lauppe’s emphasis on the stylistic pitfalls of this type of fiction is representative of the larger predicament of sex-based art at Harvard. Similar to the visual art projects that aren’t widely seen due to their lack of dissemination outside of the VES community, sexual artworks fail to gain an audience not because of their actual content, but because of the circumstances surrounding their creation. The fact that art about sex does not attract students by its very nature is intriguing.
SHOWING AND TELLING
That reality of Harvard life—that sex is not enough to guarantee an audience—can be seen in the plight of the now-defunct sex magazine H-Bomb. The magazine, founded in 2004, was already experiencing financial difficulties by the spring of 2005. James, who wrote for the magazine as a freshman, feels that the magazine can only experience a resurgence if it rethinks its approach towards sex.
“H-Bomb needs to envision a future where it’s not a sex magazine that just talks about sex as if no one else is talking about sex,” James says. “We’re in college, and tons of people have sex, and it’s not that big a deal. It’s about talking about sex in a way that matters.”Sexual art, ranging from Stone’s “Cleansed” to Rodriguez’s “SEX, America” to James’ thesis, are committed to engaging with sex in a critical fashion. Yet there is another obstacle to widespread attention on campus—the simple fact that, aside from theatrical productions, the many artistic events on campus receive little attention.
Rodriguez, whose senior thesis lacked a wide audience, might be seen as exemplifying this trend.  At the same time, she does not necessarily consider the show’s attendance a grave failing. Though she remains proud of the show, she does not believe its status as an artistic thesis makes it inherently more attention-worthy than a thesis in any other concentration. “Just because VES students work in a visual medium that is made to be seen doesn’t mean it’s different than anybody else’s homework. Some people might be doing really flamboyant experiments in chemistry,” Rodriguez says.
Indeed, it is not very often that an exceptional problem set answer gains a wide audience. Even so, it’s odd that such provocative and relevant artwork lacks a wider audience. They don’t quite constitute a subculture, but indifference from the student body does keep them underground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The shadows / I’m not living there anymore,” sings Jonathan Meiburg on “Pushing the River,” the high point of Shearwater’s new album, “Animal Joy.” This new release makes it clear that Shearwater has stepped out of the shadow of established alt-rockers Okkervil River, of which Meiburg was formerly the keyboardist.  Although Shearwater was originally begun as a side project by Meiburg and  frontman Will Sheff, it has become a force of its own. “Animal Joy” once again shows Shearwater’s constant musical evolution: the band has arisen from the gloomy murk of 2008’s “Rook” to develop an upbeat and piercing sound that despite its brightness is just as haunting.
It is hard to recognize Shearwater at first listen in the glossy, roaring beast that is “Animal Joy.” It is apparent from the album’s first track, “Animal Life,” that the stifled falsettos,  muddy chords, and folk aesthetic of 2006’s “Palo Santo” have taken a backseat to more elaborately produced rock music. “You As You Were,” the fourth track of “Animal Joy,” exemplifies this change. Over a dense backdrop of synth arpeggios, ghostly backup vocals, and pounding piano, Meiburg earnestly belts dramatic lines such as, “The shock of the exit leaves you trembling.” Shearwater may consist of soft-spoken indie musicians, but it can clearly rev up its energy to create ferocious arena rock. Moreover, the album’s densely packed layers make for an audiophile’s paradise; “Animal Joy” is less an album than a unified soundscape. A good set of headphones is needed to fully delve into the depths of tuneful melodies, hammering guitars and piano, and thundering drums.
“Immaculate,” the most danceable track on the album, demonstrates Shearwater’s ability to try on different styles. This riff-filled and up-tempo track is neither characteristic of the soothing vocals and austerity of prior releases nor of the arena-rock atmosphere of the rest of “Animal Joy.” However, its catchy, exciting drive make “Immaculate” a welcome addition to the album. Its abrupt finish—the entire track clocks in at just over two minutes—is all the more refreshing, since the next track brings the album back to more familiar territory: “Open Your Houses (Basilisk)” has soft piano textures and philosophical lyrics like “I was pinned inside of a photograph.” Shearwater may have shown an unprecedented knack for commercial-friendly songs like “Immaculate,” but they still for the most part retain their artistic dignity through off-color notes and lyrical grandeur.
However, it is during the moments that Shearwater forgets to restrain itself that “Animal Joy” borders on the hokey. The album is at times overly exultant, blasting out chords with no dynamic contrast. The more exuberant sections of tracks like “Breaking the Yearlings” can seem a tad too self-righteous. But when they rein in the booms and crashes, the eerie depths of Meiburg’s discordant voice contrast beautifully with the intensity of Shearwater’s new style. That  is why tracks like “Insolence” work; Meiburg’s soaring vocals are a light but constant presence beneath the noisy clamor of drums and inflated guitar. Here, Shearwater is artfully able to explode and retreat in turn, letting the vocals subside into instrumental interludes that are beautiful and powerful,  just as the band starts to veer towards overkill.
“Pushing the River” exemplifies this tactic of push and pull; the song almost completely fades out before the vocals, guitars, and drums return in a simultaneous burst of excitement. “You were the flashing wings of a swallow / You were the light in a lion’s eye,” sings Meiburg, his dramatic lyrics magnifying the song’s power. The raw force and poignant restraint of “Pushing the River” make it easy to see from whence “Animal Joy” derives its name.  Indeed, the band named itself after a unique and long-lived seabird, and after years of muted releases, it is nice to finally see Shearwater turn up the guitars, intensify the arrangements, and take flight.

The Stephen Petrino Company presented the unconventional dance piece “Underland” at the Institute of Contemporary Art this weekend. Originally premiering in Sydney, Australia, in 2003, “Underland” incorporated a triptych of projection screens that played videos by Mike Daly and featured a plethora of elegant and innovative costumes designed by Tara Subkoff. This convergence of different arts created an environment where the dancers were vulnerable and yet still conveyed a powerful message about moving from  darkness into light.
Petrino himself began the performance by crawling down a ladder onto a dark stage, launching the audience’s journey from the dark depths of the hellish world that the dancers call Underland through a collage of movement and dance. The piece followed no real story but instead based its abstract plot on seven ballads by pop songwriter Nick Cave.
The music was the central focus for all the dancers’ movements. Cave’s evocation of primal urges in “It’s a Wild World” set the opening ensemble scene with a series of dancers launching themselves at one another in rapid movement. This continued for a time and then suddenly shifted into a new motif entirely. This disrupted movement reflected the tumultuous nature of the dancer’s performance world, their Underland, which became apparent as their journey progressed. Petrino understood how to expose the vulnerability of his dancers from the first instant, and he used both isolation and competition in different pieces to set up an ever-changing hierarchy. The performers danced alone at times, but the struggle for power became pronounced when multiple dancers took the stage.
Above the stage sat three looming screens that showed projections and videos intended to complement the story being told. Although at times the video distracted from the dancers’ movement, the images in the video brought out ideas that the dance could not convey. During a dance that focused on creation and destruction, a repeating clip of a mushroom cloud from an atomic bomb played on the three screens. The image suddenly flipped upside down and began to play in reverse, and the dancers responded to the change as if they themselves were being manipulated by some unseen force. The video depicting complete destruction shifted to represent a tree growing from the ground, and this completed the shift to natural creation.
To reflect this transition, Subkoff’s costumes were subtle yet effective in providing dancers with an added burst of energy as the performance progressed. The initial gray and black costumes seemed drab and uninspired, yet small hints of color and design could be recognized at various moments. After the dancers entered into a hellish scene complete with an elegant fire video, jealousy seemed to pervade the movement. The three dancers onstage vyed for each other’s attention unsuccessfully, which added to the intensity of the scene.  Yet Subkoff allowed this feeling of hopelessness to translate to the costumes, which appeared to take on a life of their own. Frayed sleeves extended to the waist prohibited the dancers from controlling how, at times, their clothing fell. Instead of distracting both audience and performer, this design heightened the level of risk and excitement in the show.
A fluid costume design helped the diverse group of dancers seem like one entity that lived and breathed as a unit. Petrino’s choreography focused in on the individual strengths of each performer, while still adding to the sense that they formed an ensemble. When individual dancers were on stage, they embodied a movement that was then built on by the rest of the dancers who emerged slowly from offstage. As Cave’s music builds, so too did the ensemble of dancers, presenting movement as if it were organic in nature.
The ultimate embodiment of this unity came with the climax of the production, as the dancers emerged from the imposing darkness of the Underland and arrived in the overwhelming light. The ensemble presented their movement in complete unison to the unsubtle Cave song “Death Is Not the End.”
The simple gestures closed the performance on a powerful note. Petrino and his company used the abstract to take the audience on a journey, something that is difficult to do with this form of dance, and that story thrives in the unison of the ensemble.
No individual stood out by the end of the performance. Rather, each dancer appeared to make up part of one unified body onstage, and that one body refused to be confined to the dark depths of Underland.

There are thousands of song covers spread across the Internet, and most of them are bad. Some are exact renditions which don’t try to add any value to the original song; some, too adventurous, lose the original meaning of the song altogether; some are terribly sung, played, and recorded. Covers are dangerous ground for aspiring musicians, and knowing the breadth of the existing mediocrity, Jeff Dorenfeld must have approached his new covers project, “Under the Influence,” with trepidation. Dorenfeld, the faculty adviser of the Berklee College of Music’s Heavy Rotation Records, spearheaded this covers album in which Berklee students and alumni cover the songs of popular alternative rock bands such as Gang of Four, Smashing Pumpkins, and R.E.M. The album is an impressive display of Berklee talent, as each artist completely restyles their two chosen songs without losing the ingenuity of the original compositions.
The idea for the project arose from an interaction between Dorenfeld and his son. “My son was listening to a lot of My Bloody Valentine, and he was saying how all these alternative bands influenced a lot of current popular artists,” Dorenfeld said. In turn, many ’80s bands, like the Pixies and Joy Division, have recently found greater audiences and seen record sales increase in part because of the bands they’ve influenced. Dorenfeld conceived the idea of selecting Berklee students to record two covers: one by an ’80s band and one by a popular modern artist who was influenced by that group. By putting ancestor and progeny side by side in a particular style, the similarities would hopefully become all the more noticeable. Dorenfeld called producer Paul Kolderie, acclaimed for his work with the Pixies, Radiohead, and Hole, to lead the way. “I don’t mind doing covers, as long as they’re approached in a fresh way,” Kolderie said.
Kolderie found his young counterparts in the studio to be creative, bold, and technically talented. The album begins with Berklee alum Julia Easterlin playing the Pixies’ “Hold My Body” and Radiohead’s “There There.” Whereas the Pixies’ version of the song is pulsing and grungy, Easterlin’s version has a bright organic bounce; it relies heavily on vocal rhythmic patterns and Easterlin’s expansive vocals. Her Radiohead cover, too, deviates heavily from the original, with shimmering percussive bells and hand drums. “There’s no way I can sing Radiohead the way Thom Yorke sings it and pull it off,” Easterlin said. “I wanted to take the song in my own direction and make it unsettling and ethereal.”
While Easterlin scales up her songs by adding intricate layers of harmony, David Pramik, covering Joy Division and U2, took the opposite approach. His much barer arrangements lean heavily on simple piano and guitar chords and his warm voice. U2’s “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” released in 1987, is a soaring epic; Pramik’s version is forlorn and hymnal. “[The song] is very biblical and religious,” Pramik said. “I wanted to hear it much more intimately.” While many other artists on the album succeed through their dense arrangements, Pramik lets the melodies speak for themselves. Moreover, his stripped-down arrangements reveal a strong melodic link between Joy Division and U2, which is exactly what Dorenfeld hoped for.
“Under the Influence” makes for a very strange 48 minutes. The album hops from genre to genre without segues. Da’Rayia turns up the funk on energetic reinterpretations of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Gang of Four; she is followed by the Boston Boy’s bluegrass strum of Hüsker Dü’s “Don’t Wanna Know If You Are Lonely,” an album highlight due to its laid back harmonies.  The thrashing Berklee String Metal Ensemble immediately follows. But given all of the album’s incongruities, Dorenfield acknowledges that the album isn’t meant to be critiqued holistically. “We wanted to take from all different genres,” Dorenfeld said. “We understand that some tracks may not appeal to some people.”
The album may not be cohesive, but the project mostly succeeds because the covers are not just variations of existing compositions but wholly new artistic creations. The arrangements by Kolderie and the individual musicians are fresh and often startling, and the performances are superb. Moreover, the album has impressed at least one of the original artists. “Roger [Miller of Mission of Burma] said he liked the cover of their song,” Kolderie said. These Berklee musicians, as well as thousands of their peers, are working tirelessly in hopes of one day being able to admire covers of their own compositions.

French writer Michel Houellebecq has inspired as much critical admiration and literary devotion as he has incited animosity and dispute. Given the discourse usually surrounding Houellebecq, his most recent novel “The Map and the Territory”—first released in French in 2010 and now translated into English by Gavin Bowd—is surprising in its immediate appeal. Its intellectual ambition is not just stylistic: “The Map and the Territory” also includes well-researched passages on artistic subjects as wide-ranging as photography to architecture.
“The Map and the Territory” traces the artistic career of Jed Martin from his undergraduate project of photographing commercial objects, to the critical success of his photographs of Michelin maps, to the financial success of his series of paintings depicting post-industrial professions, and, finally, to his reclusive last years and death. Jed asks a fictionalized Houellebecq—one of the main characters of the novel—to write the catalog for his “Series of Simple Professions.” He quickly becomes fascinated by “the author of ‘The Elementary Particle,’” an epithet repeatedly given to Houellebecq by the narrator to humorous effect.
Though he is the protagonist—or at least the narrative focus of the novel—the artist Jed Martin is virtually inaccessible. We are privy to his thoughts thanks to an omniscient narrator, but the tone remains neutral, almost journalistic. A lengthy passage is devoted to the description of Jed putting away his first substantial project as an artist: he has reached a creative dead-end and realizes he must pursue a different approach to his work. It is a situation ripe for the emotional development of the character, and the opportunity is tellingly ignored.
Not a stereotypically erratic artist, Houellebecq’s Jed is remarkably stable, even pedestrian. There is none of the ideal Romantic artist in Jed. Even his solitary habits show none of the depression and volatility characteristically associated with artists, to which the fictional Houellebecq in “The Map and Territory” is so prone.
None of this is to say that Jed is unlikeable: the magnetism about him is difficult to resist. “His gallerist seemed to be struggling,” Houellebecq writes, “Waving his arms around distractedly, and for an instant Jed wanted to come to his aid, before remembering what he’d always known, and what Marylin had categorically told him a few days before: he was never better than when silent.” It is the readers’ curiosity towards the opacity of Jed’s inner life combined with his external charm that gives “The Map and the Territory” its propellant arc.
In contrast, fictional Houellebecq, who in many ways serves as a foil to Jed, elicits foremost an emotional response. And, despite the simplistic caricatures given of Houellebecq by the press—“Anyway, the press is unbearably stupid and conformist, don’t you find?” he says to Jed on their first meeting—the Houellebecq that emerges is heartbreakingly sympathetic. Houellebecq the author has drawn criticism for his controversial—some might say piggishly stubborn—stance towards sex and religion, most infamously condensed in his quote, “Islam is the stupidest of all religions.” The character Houellebecq, however, is fragile and ambivalent. Though he states his opinions strongly, he tenderly and embarrassedly goes back on some of his polemics. On first meeting, he gives to Jed a staunch defense of the intelligence of pigs to explain his refusal to eat pork; a few chapters later, he is seen surrounded by chorizo, mortadella, and pâté de campagne, admitting, “I’ve completely relapsed into charcuterie.”
Houellebecq’s audacious decision to fictionalize himself in “The Map and the Territory” results in fruitful complications of narrative representation—rather than in the insufferable, self-indulgent drivel that one might expect. The narrator is omniscient to the point of reporting what future art historians will say about Jed’s oeuvre, but the reader’s access to the character Houellebecq is limited through the lens of Jed. “[Houellebecq] had changed, Jed realized. … He was, thought Jed, like an animal that had put on his winter coat.” The fictional Houellebecq is thus distanced from the Houellebecq that depicted him; the intermediary layers of authorship call into question the fidelity of Houellebecq’s voice.
As Jed’s photographs of Michelin maps are twice removed from the territory, so is Houellebecq the character from Houellebecq the author—whose name at birth was Michel Thomas. These are instances of the novel’s hesitant attitude towards the relationship between art and its subject. The detailed and exhaustive portrait of Jed gives the reader very little sense of his essence; yet Houellebecq the author seems more richly colored even though he can only be seen at an arm’s length.
Houellebecq has been called many things: brutal, nihilistic, cynical. His latest novel is then perhaps uncharacteristic in the compassion and humanity with which it describes its subjects. Jed’s photographs forced his society to re-examine Michelin maps. In “The Map and the Territory” Houellebecq revises the representations others have given of him by creating his own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his column in The Crimson last week, Derek Bekebrede wrote that the Obama administration “has decreed that religion and religious values are no longer welcome in civil society.” Leading a vehemently anti-secular chorus of Republican presidential candidates, Rick Perry promised in a much-parodied television spot to “end Obama’s war on religion” which has supposedly made it impossible for “kids to openly celebrate Christmas and pray in school.” Even the ostensibly sane current Republican front-runner, Mitt Romney, is convinced that the current administration is leading “an assault on the conviction and the religious beliefs of members of our society.” Given the rudimentary outline of the story—a president of purportedly non-Christian origin, a wave of outrage from leading intellectuals like Newt Gingrich—it would be possible for a visitor from Mars to conclude that President Obama is at war with religion.
Except, of course, that he is not. Despite how well most liberal secularists remember the outsize role of religion in policy from 2001 to 2009, they proudly elected a president in 2008 who promised to maintain it, allowing some minor adjustments. Inspired by his predecessor’s example, Obama kept open the White House’s office for faith-based initiatives, “giv[ing] religious figures a bigger role in influencing White House decisions” and consecrating a new level of intimacy between church and the highest levels of state. Presaging a national political career that would justify social policy ideas with themes from the New Testament, Obama proclaimed in his 2004 keynote address to the Democratic National Convention, “We worship an awesome God in the blue states.”
Except, of course, when we do not. In courting America’s religious majority, the Obama administration has demonstrated little support for secular Americans. Despite their disproportionate representation in the arts, sciences, and all manner of scholarship, it is nearly impossible for an openly nonreligious person to run successfully for public office. As recently as June 2011, 49 percent of adults polled by Gallup avowed that they would not under any circumstances support an atheist for president. And while liberal readers might be sure that this is strictly a problem of the right, may it be noted that of all 244 Democratic members of Congress, only one—Pete Stark (CA-13)—is openly atheist.
Some supporters of President Obama argue that a religiously inspired presidency should be acceptable to secular Americans, provided that it inclines more toward the humanistic New Testament than the stringent Old Testament. All reasonable people believe in universal healthcare and humanitarian military intervention, right? So what if it means the President is not sure about how marriage equality sits with his religious conscience?
As a secular American, I beg to differ. Not all of us are liberal Democrats; there are plenty of libertarians, quirky independents, and open-minded conservatives among our diverse and growing ranks. And although I certainly find him more palatable than most of his Republican rivals, I do not any more appreciate having to accept Obama’s liberal policies on the basis of a worldview beyond rational substantiation. Unlike today’s religious conservatives, I know that I am not being persecuted—but I feel deeply concerned when President Obama invokes faith to unite Episcopalians on the left and Baptists on the right, to the exclusion of me and millions of other secular Americans.
If a place where presidential policy and rhetoric are inspired by the teachings of an “awesome God” can be called a secular tyranny, then we should be doubly afraid of the theocratic alternative proposed by the right-wing primary crowd. In what is hailed as the party of small government, nothing is more in vogue than legislating Leviticus and Deuteronomy—biblical books whose dictates bear a striking similarity to the Islamic shari’a law that their proponents decry.
Big-ticket Republicans face excommunication if they fail to toe the line on abortion, same-sex marriage, or sham issues like school prayer—a standard that has vanquished such potential standard-bearers as Rudy Giuliani and Jon Huntsman. In terms of foreign policy, the current election cycle has seen messianically inspired Republican candidates beat the drums of war against Iran in a misguided effort to sway Jewish votes on the basis of a single issue. If I have read the founding fathers properly, this is not what they had in mind.
In short, the idea of an Obama administration-led “secular tyranny” fails to hold water, especially when held up to the very real prospect of a Republican regime of effective religious establishment. But truthfully, neither option is ideal. For all of its advantages, the liberal theology professed by Obama and his ilk continues to privilege religious voices in political discourse over those of an unrepresented secular minority. When secular blue-state voters like me are nudged by a community-organizing Chicago liberal to remember that we worship an awesome God, we puzzle over how anyone could think of the Obama administration as a secular tyranny.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting Wednesday, administrators discussed the possibility of adding a midterm course evaluation to the Q guide in addition to the one that occurs at the end of the semester. Proposed by the chair of the Undergraduate Council's Education Committee, this idea may look good on paper but will in practice likely not be helpful either to students or faculty and only compound some of the problems surrounding class selection. The problem is, as stated during the meeting by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, faculty do not seriously consider student evaluations in the Q guide.
For one, it is not difficult to imagine a formula for faculty to receive good Q scores for their courses in the present form of the system. As students who both have a busy schedule and are driven to do well in their courses, Harvard undergraduates tend to rate highly courses that are enjoyable and not particularly difficult. As a result, it is not surprising that for many courses a high level of homework and testing tends to correlate inversely with Q scores. Because most professors and teaching fellows would rather prioritize relaying course content to students than alleviating their workloads, it is natural that they should in turn not read the Q guide too seriously. As a result, far from acting as a resource for professors, the Q much more effectively serves to guide other students, helping them to select which courses are fun and manageable at the same time. Adding another evaluation in the middle of the semester after the add-drop deadline would in all likelihood serve little purpose to students.
Furthermore, the professors who do care for student input can and do distribute their own course evaluations. These surveys, which can be tailored specifically to the circumstances of a particular class with questions chosen by the professor, are far more useful than a standardized school wide evaluation. As it is currently proposed, the midterm evaluation would merely serve the purpose of doing the same thing that pre-term planning has—creating an administrative burden that is a hindrance to students and ignored by many faculty members.
This is of course not to say that there are not some cases where the Q guide can help faculty. For example, the restructuring of Life Sciences 1b after years of dismal Q rating marked a clear victory for student evaluation. But these cases remain exceptions, not the norm, and are likely to affect course planning and structure seriously only in extreme cases when student feedback repeatedly falls so far on one side of the spectrum.
Instead, to account for the possibility of successful change arising from Q evaluations while at the same time keeping in mind the primary role of the Q guide is to help students, end-of-semester evaluation should be restructured to better serve this purpose. As it stands, the Q guide adopts an excessively professional and impersonal tone; it should be made more informal to increase utility to students. For example, instead of asking whether a class has turned one into a better citizen, the guide could ask questions that speak more directly to student concerns about a class’ atmosphere, level of difficulty, and pleasantness.  Moreover, the simple fix of making the Q guide mandatory would eliminate the bias that is inherent to any voluntary response system: Students with particularly strong opinions about a class, as opposed to the students who are more or less satisfied with their experience, are inevitably more likely to respond and so skew the evaluations.
In its current form, the Q guide can facilitate critical evaluation from students. But the purpose of this critical evaluation is to serve other students when selecting courses, and even in this capacity it could be improved upon significantly. A midterm evaluation, which would be of no use to students, is a distraction from the needed restructuring of the Q guide to serve its purpose better.

Earlier last week, the overturning of Proposition 8 in a federal appeals court demonstrated the persistent societal progress toward marriage equality for the queer community.  Furthermore, another victorious leap in the fight for equality came as the Washington State Senate approved a measure that brought the state one step closer to allowing same-sex marriages. Both milestones were marked with emotional upheaval on each side of the debate—gay couples rejoiced while opponents cried out at the prospect of a country wherein rights are administered in an equitable fashion.
Although achieving victories in the quest for same-sex marriage equality at the state level has been a key part of reversing discriminatory policies, it is not enough. If all states were to legalize same-sex marriage (even Arizona!), federal statues will continue to prohibit the recognition of key rights that often go overlooked. The Defense of Marriage Act, a policy that has marginalized queer families since 1996, institutionalizes discrimination on a level that is unaffected by the continued achievements in the fight for marriage equality.
For instance, even if the legalization measure passes in the State House of Representatives, same-sex couples in Washington will still be unable to garner immigration rights at the federal level. In heterosexual couples, an individual can sponsor his or her married partner so that he or she may become a naturalized citizen after three years. However, due to the policies implemented by DOMA, a gay immigrant married to a United States citizen of the same sex can still be deported. In a country that touts freedom and opportunity as hallmarks of American society, this injustice faced by same-sex couples is an affront to the concept of “equal treatment under law.” We cannot be oblivious to the persistent struggles faced by couples in states that we believe are safe spaces for the LGBT community.
In a popular 2011 federal case, a Venezuelan immigrant married to an American citizen faced deportation although he had married his partner in Connecticut, a state where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2008. Despite not following through on deportation orders, Attorney General Eric Holder indicated that the state would continue to enforce the immigration law against same-sex couples. Currently, gay individuals are barred from even attempting to sponsor their same-sex partners to become United States citizens—federal immigration forms still read “husband” and “wife.”
A plethora of further federal statutes propagated by DOMA partially nullify the victories gained at the state level. Social security benefits cannot be transferred between same-sex married partners, a restriction that continues to place gay couples in financial risk in the event of a spouse's death. Even further, military policy prevents same-sex partners from receiving healthcare and pension benefits for the husbands and wives of those who, as politicians love to applaud, “defend our freedoms.” For politicians, it is disgustingly convenient to proclaim “Support our troops!” while financially crippling those of our nation’s heroes who happen to love someone of the same sex.
If Hillary Clinton were being fully genuine in her widely publicized condemnation of anti-gay discrimination at the United Nations, she would have addressed the tragic irony that it was President Bill Clinton who defined marriage as being between one man and one woman in DOMA. Although the “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” policy has been successfully repealed, the federal norms established during Clinton’s administration continue to harm gay soldiers. Thankfully, as legislators begin to change their outlook on same-sex marriage in an attempt to avoid being on the wrong side of history, such policies will be eroded. Same-sex marriage will become recognized throughout the country, eventually, as San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom put it, “whether you like it or not.”
However, to move the process forward, politicians at the federal level must take bold action in order to set a current precedent against discrimination. Although education was considered a state issue, Dwight Eisenhower had the fortitude to utilize federal power to promote the desegregation of schools in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957. Today, at a time when federally-based discrimination continues to threaten the access of Americans to the equal pursuit of happiness, politicians must not be afraid to intervene. Although same-sex marriage accomplishments in State Congresses move us closer to a country devoid of legal segregation, only the courage of the federal government will reverse the history of oppression experienced by the queer community.
The overturning of Proposition 8 has given the Supreme Court the opportunity to definitively rule against marriage inequality. In affirming the rights of the individual as the court has done in landmark cases such as Lawrence v. Texas and Roe v. Wade, the court must take an activist stance in once and for all eliminating discriminatory state practices. The time will come when close-minded pundits and politicians look back in disgust at their stance against social progress. Now, it is up to the courts to ensure that that moment comes sooner rather than later.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last April, Yale University established a historic partnership with the National University of Singapore to create its first campus outside of New Haven. Yale-NUS College, the first liberal arts institution to open in Asia, expects its first class of students in 2013. This partnership has raised various questions among commentators on higher education about the viability of the liberal arts education model in a country that upholds rigid educational traditions rooted in Confucian meritocracy—that is, a set of philosophies contradictory to the principles of a liberal arts education.
Of course, one can argue that Yale’s branch campus can potentially open up opportunities for liberalization in the academic sphere and beyond in Singapore. For now, however, all surface evidence suggests that engaging with problematic issues is not a priority on Yale’s agenda. Professor Christopher L. Miller of Yale, one of many like-minded commentators, has written a highly critical article in the Chronicle of Higher Education to expose the conspicuous issues of censorship and discrimination raised by this partnership. Most notably, he remarks that, if employed at Yale-NUS, he would be “subject to arrest” because of his homosexuality, which is in principle punishable by law in Singapore. It goes without saying that such an environment is fundamentally incompatible with Yale’s principles of non-discrimination, diversity, and unfettered academic freedom.
With carefully chosen rhetoric explaining why the international community needs to engage with Asia in this “Asian century,” the website of the new college emphasizes that the aim of the school is to “strengthen” and “contextualize” Yale’s liberal arts education model and make it relevant to Singapore and Asia at large. This claim, which seems reasonable at first glance, raises an obvious question: What exactly is this so-called “Asian context”? A liberal arts education, like the one we enjoy at Harvard, by its very nature eludes placement into any restrictive context. In fact, the only “context” needed is one that fosters the free inquiry of knowledge, inclusiveness, and diversity. Having completed an Asian-style education in Hong Kong, I can say from experience that this “Asian context” in question is in reality a euphemism for the narrowly defined, test-based, conservative educational philosophies prevalent across Asia. Singapore’s education system in particular, as is rather well-known in Asia, utilizes a “streaming” system based on arbitrary examinations at a young age. Primary school students as young as nine or ten are “streamed” into higher or lower-level academic programs according to their standardized examination results, with students labeled “less able” often facing much discouragement and undue stress from their peers, teachers, and parents. It seems fair to say that such a “context” is fundamentally incompatible with the ideal that underlies the liberal arts philosophy that Yale embraces.
In an interview, Tan Chorh Chuan, president of the NUS, said that one important goal of the joint campus is to catalyze the development of liberal arts education in Asia. This claim warrants a further question about the nature and viability of the project—namely, why a liberal arts education needs to be introduced through a partnership with Yale, one of the world’s most prestigious colleges, and not through local reform. To those who are familiar with the prevailing Asian mentality toward education, it is easy to understand why Yale’s name is absolutely necessary for such an endeavor to succeed at all. Put bluntly, very few students—rather, very few parents—would allow their children to bother with a liberal arts education if a prestigious college’s name were not somehow attached to the program. It is very likely that a great number of students will enroll in Yale-NUS for the prestige without truly embracing the value of the liberal arts education that they will receive. A few overwhelmingly popular majors will likely draw a majority of students, making this “liberal arts” college not much different from highly specialized colleges where students of high ability choose one of a small range of subjects considered most useful and prestigious.
The “Asian context” for the liberal arts education offered at Yale-NUS seems to entail adopting the more superficial aspects of a liberal arts model without engaging with the values that it represents. As such, it is difficult to think of the college as a catalyst for real educational liberalization in Singapore and the continent beyond. As Miller suggests, we might just have to wait and see whether Yale’s fundamental principles of academic freedom and non-discrimination, as well as its liberal arts ideal, will remain intact after the college admits its first students. One hope is that the international faculty that is eventually employed at Yale-NUS, as champions of liberal thought and learning, will use their influence to foster more liberal views on specific issues and on education among students, even if substantial change cannot be created in the system itself. Students who are exposed, even if reluctantly, to a liberal arts education may one day become parents who appreciate the merits of such a system and bring more flexibility and open-mindedness to the traditional Asian perspective on education and success.

Students gathered to talk Japanese love hotels, fetishes, and pornography during a presentation on Tuesday by human sexuality writer and speaker Midori, entitled “Pink Japan: Contemporary Sex Culture.”
The event was co-hosted by the student groups Gay, Lesbian, Or Whatever (GLOW) and Queer Liberation. This marked the first event hosted by Queer Liberation, a new student organization created by former Queer Students and Allies chairs Jonas Wang ’12 and Samuel J. Bakkila ’12.
Wang said he and Bakkila decided to form the new group in order to push the boundaries of acceptable sexual discussion.
Although the group is not officially recognized by the College, Bakkila said they hope to host more events in the future that focus on neglected queer issues.
During the event, Midori, a native of Japan, guided attendees through a photographic tour of Japanese love hotels, erotic shops, and other legal, sex-related locales.
From depicting machines that dispensed vibrators and beer to pornography shops the size of a supermarket, Midori described her talk as the “Travel Channel after hours.”
“I specialize in an urban safari and shed light upon the erotic recreation of the ordinary Japanese [citizen],” Midori said. “This is an aspect of life in any culture that’s not going to show up in nice travel guides.”
Midori focused on the sexual culture of average Japanese couples to debunk what she said were Western misconceptions of Japanese relationships. According to Midori, these incorrect assumptions do “nothing to foster a global and cultural understanding."
As part of the event, Midori provided an assortment of handouts and pamphlets, including flyers from gay and lesbian bars, erotic comic books, and scholarly analyses on Japanese sex clubs.
At the conclusion of her tour of Japanese sexual culture, Midori said she hoped attendees had gained a new understanding of what sexual behavior is considered “normal.”
“This is an aspect of human sexuality that is part of sociology and anthropology,” Midori said. “I just take an entertaining perspective on it.”
After hearing about the event through several LGBTQ and sexuality list-servs, Kat M. Baus ’15 said she decided to attend to learn about the more academic side of sexual culture.
“It was definitely different from what I expected,” Baus said. “Here the information was presented matter-of-factly, like it was just part of life.”

While many college seniors are eagerly anticipating their launch into the “real world,” Gaibrielle A. Bryant ’12 returned for the spring term with a job offer that might take her right back to her hometown of Detroit—and she is thrilled.
Bryant is one of 28 college seniors from across the country selected by Venture for America to work, fully-paid, at start-ups in four American cities prime for economic revival: Cincinnati, Detroit, New Orleans, and Providence.
The program, which connects enterprising students with two-year jobs at start-ups, received about 250 applications for its inaugural application cycle this fall.
Bryant is the only student from Harvard to be selected.
“She’s a Detroit native, so her passion to revitalize is very clear,” said Eileen S. Lee, VFA chief operations officer. “There was a general consensus that she would make an immediate positive impact wherever she went.”
Not everyone supported Bryant’s choice to pursue a job in Detroit.
“I got a lot of push back from family and friends about coming to Detroit,” she explained. “They don’t see any potential in Detroit—they think if I come back I’ll get stuck.”
But Bryant is committed to drawing out the city’s potential. “I’ve been seeing what’s been going on in [Detroit] for a long time now,” she said. “I want to be a part of that, and I want to help—I believe that’s the way that a city comes back from economic hardships.”
Bryant was selected as one of 46 applicants invited to a final selection day in New York City on Jan. 20, during which she participated in group activities with other applicants and individual interviews with VFA staff members.
“It’s a weird experience because you are actually with a group of people—you’re making connections with them,” Bryant said.
The extensive application process might have deterred many prospective applicants, Lee said. More than one thousand people registered online accounts with VFA in the fall, she said, but only about 250 completed applications by the Nov. 28 deadline.
VFA hopes to push the application process even earlier next year to stay competitive with finance and consulting deadlines, according to Lee.
Bryant acknowledged the draw of finance and consulting, especially at Harvard, but suggested that many students turn to those fields simply because they are anxious to get a lucrative job quickly.
“I wanted more than just a job. I wanted the experience and to do something that I was proud of,” she said. “I don’t have an $80,000 job, but I’m actually okay with that.”
Bryant hopes to launch her own start-up: an incubator. “What I would maybe one day start in Detroit is an artist incubator—creating a space where artists could perform or create,” she said. “I think that Detroit’s such a cultural place.”
VFA is accepting applications through Feb. 20 for 20 to 25 more fellows to be selected later this spring. About eight of the approximately 1,500 applications already started are from Harvard, according to Lee.

The relationship between the U.S. and Pakistani intelligence communities is “okay,” U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron P. Munter said on Monday, but the two nations’ military relationship is “not okay.”
Munter delivered this frank analysis during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School in which he emphasized the importance of repairing strained ties between the nation he represents and the place he is stationed.
“Assistance to Pakistan should have the goal of ending assistance to Pakistan,” Munter said.
He said he hopes that the “assistance relationship” that currently exists will morph into a “partnership” fostered by U.S. trade, business, and investment in Pakistan.
Munter also said that the U.S. should have a more “modest” relationship with Pakistan—less extensive involvement in Pakistan’s affairs and “less bluster” in the dialogue between the nations.
Munter has spent his diplomatic career in Afghanistan, Czech Republic, Germany, Iraq, Poland, Serbia, and Washington, D.C.
Munter’s current post, Kennedy School professor Nicholas R. Burns said in his introduction to Munster’s speech, may be the most challenging of all American diplomatic assignments.
“The U.S.-Pakistani relationship is among our most important,” Burns said. Precarious negotiations surrounding terrorism, al-Qaeda, and U.S. engagement in Afghanistan make U.S. activity in South Asia the “heart of American diplomacy,” Burns said.
Kennedy School student Adam M. Levy said after Munter’s lecture that America’s involvement in Pakistan has been overbearing. “The United States is not there to solve clearly regional issues,” he said.
But he added that he trusted Munter to handle the difficult situation. “He is a dynamic, great guy. Our country is in great hands.”
Munter said that he believes the current strain in the United States’ relationship with Pakistan is in part the result of a “wave of idealism” in U.S. government in 2008.
Leaders at the time “over-promised” extensive commitments to Pakistan, aiming to strengthen the two countries’ relations, Munter said. But those assurances backfired when American leaders failed to deliver on their promises.
“I was interested by the geopolitics which he talked about, how the U.S. relationship with Pakistan is impacted by India and China,” Ben J. Lamont ’14 said. “We need to look beyond a bilateral relationship with Pakistan and examine the situation in a broader context.”
Such expansive conversations are difficult, attendees acknowledged. But Omer Aftab ’11, who comes from Pakistan, said that he was “impressed with [Munter’s] willingness to tackle tough issues.”

The University will offer a Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program to library employees 55 years and older with 10 years of service under their belts, according to a University spokesperson.
Those who choose to accept the offer will receive six months’ pay, plus two additional weeks’ pay for every year of employment beyond 10 years. An employee cannot receive more than one year’s worth of salary under the package.
Approximately 275 employees are eligible for the plan. There are 930 full-time employees within the University library system.
Once they receive the details of their personal plan, workers will have 46 calendar days to decide whether or not to accept it.
Workers were informed of the program via email early afternoon Monday.
The plan is part of an ongoing restructuring of the University library system, which seeks to unify Harvard’s 73 currently independent libraries.
Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton had previously said at a town hall meeting with library employees that “the Library workforce will be smaller than it is now.”
In an email to the Crimson, a university spokesperson said that with improvement to the library system in mind, “the University is implementing a generous, voluntary early retirement program that will both offer incentives to qualifying employees who wish to retire and help the library meet the needs of its new organization.”
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said the offer was just another ambiguous message from the administration in a process that it has not handled well.
“It’s one more step that seems premature and that is poorly considered and not broadly enough consulted about,” Jaeger said. “There’s a record-breaking level of turmoil and anxiety among the staff. This just adds to the confusion.”
Jaeger said that this announcement did nothing to address the fact that, according to HUCTW members, the library is understaffed as it is.
“At this point, the case hasn’t been made for staff reductions,” Jaeger said. He added that if the library does not have a solid plan going forward, this program could cause it to lose money.
He also said that the possibility of a Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program was never mentioned in discussions between the union and the library.
“It’s really hard for the library staff to know what to make of the early retirement offer,” Jaeger said. “The big question that crowds out all the others is, ‘Why?’”
Karen L. O’Brien, a library assistant who noted that she was too young to take the offer, said that she thought that the announcement mirrored the steps the library took in the past when it sought staff reductions.
O’Brien said she thought that more employees were likely to accept the early retirement program if they had been previously scared by the threat of layoffs.
Since Shenton’s announcement, some library employees have taken to the streets to protest the possibility of layoffs, picketing outside of a meeting for library staff members and staging multiple public demonstrations.
Sunday night, members of Occupy Harvard took over Lamont Library Café, pledging to stay in the café until 10 p.m. on Friday in order to protest library staff reductions.
Andrew J. Pope, a doctoral student in history and Occupy Harvard supporter, said that the early retirement program leaves library employees with few options.
“If they don’t take the offer and are laid off, the family will be in a dire financial situation,” Pope said,
Rudi E. Batzell, another doctoral student in history who also supports Occupy, echoed Pope’s concerns.
“[The Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program] forces [workers] to make an economic decision without any sense of what their alternatives are,” Batzell said.
Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, a Crimson associate editorial executive and a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, was skeptical about the early retirement program’s potential effectiveness.
“I think it’s stupid,” Korn said. “Harvard can’t completely revamp its library system in the next 46 days.”
The University has said it will provide more information on staff reductions over the coming weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite warnings from the University that they could lose their library privileges indefinitely if they continue to sleep in the library overnight, members of the Occupy Harvard movement remained in Lamont Café on Monday to protest announced staff reductions in Harvard libraries.
Protestors said Harvard University police officers handed out flyers outlining appropriate conduct for Lamont Library users on Monday afternoon. “Students, staff, faculty members, researchers, visitors, and other users who fail to comply with library rules and regulations are subject to revocation of library privileges, disciplinary action, and legal prosecution,” the flyer stated.
“The protesters in the café will be expected to respect the restrictions placed on access to Lamont Library, including the rights of others to the quiet use of what is a central study space for our undergraduate students,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal said.
Protestors said that these guidelines are an inappropriate reaction to their activities.
“As undergraduate and graduate students here, losing library privileges is tantamount to expulsion,” a doctoral student in history Andrew J. Pope said. Despite the severity of this threat, Pope said that many protestors would not be deterred from their goal.
In response to the University’s announcement earlier in the day about the Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program, an optional early retirement offer for eligible library employees, protestors said the package is “coercive,” “ineffective,” and “manipulative” as workers would not know in advance whether they would be laid off or not.
Many protestors said that this development would not change their decision to remain in Lamont until Friday at 10 p.m.
Several Occupy supporters met with University President Drew G. Faust Monday afternoon to discuss Harvard’s policy on free speech, which they felt had been violated.
Pointing to the flyer of rules printed on neon pink paper, doctoral student in history Rudi E. Batzell said, “This is the piece of literature distributed by police to shut down free speech and prevent conversation that the University considers inconvenient from happening.”
At around 11:30 a.m., two Harvard administrators and police officers came to Lamont Café to take down the banner that read “No Layoffs” on one side, “No Cuts” on the other, protestors said.
According to Pope, the administrators said they had violated an “unwritten library policy” about hanging up signs in the library.
“Harvard has a very strict free speech policy that applies to everyone in the community,” Pope said. “The sign was speech, so how could they tell us to take it down? This is infringing on free speech.”
Neal said that the University’s response to the Occupy supporters does not violate Harvard’s free speech policy.
“As we said when protesters pitched tents in Harvard Yard, free speech and the free exchange of ideas are hallmarks of the Harvard experience, and we respect and protect the rights of protesters to express their views,” Neal wrote in an email. “At the same time, the University has a fundamental obligation to attend to the security of its students, faculty and staff and to ensure that studying and other academic activities proceed without disruption on campus.”
A total of four HUPD officers—two at the entrance of Lamont Library and two inside the café—were on guard throughout the night.
Bonarene M. S. Wakam ’12, Lamont Café shift manager, said the security guards and the police have been a far more prominent and noticeable presence in the Library than the protestors.
“The Occupiers haven’t been disruptive at all. They’ve been quiet and peaceful, and if it weren’t for the oversized posters announcing their cause, you could easily mistake them for a large study group,” added Yi J. Chow ’13, Lamont Café senior manager.

Harvard affiliates took home three of the nine National Humanities Medals awarded for 2011, in a ceremony earlier this week at the White House.
Columbia professor Andrew H. Delbanco '73, who holds three Harvard degrees, University Professor Robert C. Darnton '60, and University Professor Amartya Sen received their medals for their contributions to the study of the humanities in the United States.
The medal winners were announced last Friday, and they received their awards personally from President Barack Obama on Monday.
“I was completely flabbergasted,” said Delbanco, who is currently the director of the American Studies program at Columbia University. “This really was an honor I was not expecting.”
Delbanco, who was named “America’s Best Social Critic” by Time Magazine in 2001, said he has tried to bring the humanities to a wider audience.
“I would like to think that the award has something to do with my efforts to make the humanities matter to young people and to the nation at large,” he said.
In a press release, the White House Office of the Press Secretary noted Delbanco’s “insight into the American character, past and present,” and cited his writings on American authors like Herman Melville and Ralph Waldo Emerson, Class of 1821.
A former assistant professor of English and American Literature and tutor in Dunster House, Delbanco credited some of his success to his mentors at Harvard, where he earned his undergraduate, masters, and doctoral degrees.
“In a way this award belongs partly to the great teachers I had at Harvard,” he said.
Darnton, a history professor and the university librarian, received his medal for “his determination to make knowledge accessible to everyone,” according to the White House press release. Darnton has co-led the national effort to launch the Digital Public Library of America—an online collection that might eventually include every volume ever printed and would be freely accessible to every American citizen.
According to the press release, Sen won his medal for “his insights into the causes of poverty, famine, and injustice.”
A native of India, Sen won the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on the economic causes of famine.
In 1990, he helped create the United Nations Human Development Index.
Past award recipients have included University Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and comparative religion professor Diana L. Eck.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard moves forward in its planning for Allston, the University updated community members on its progress at a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting on Monday. But the announcement elicited much skepticism from residents, who said they felt the update lacked crucial details and a sufficient commitment from the University.
“It is unacceptable that Harvard is coming to us with a third major proposal and not committing to a time-frame for the science project,” said Cathleen Campbell, a Task Force member and Allston resident. “We have approved the I-Lab, Tata Hall, and now they’re saying that they want to do another project in our community without a time frame when it’s been four years.”
At the meeting, Kevin Casey, the University’s senior director of federal and state relations, informed residents that Harvard is in the midst of academic and logistical planning for resuming construction on its Western Ave. science center. Casey also told community members that the University is currently searching for a third-party developer to construct faculty and graduate housing in Barry’s Corner.
In 2007, Harvard began construction on the Allston Science Complex, a one billion dollar science complex that was envisioned to be, among other things, a mecca for stem cell research. At that time, the University said that it would also create a “main street” on Western Ave.—two prospects that excited many residents.
But the University’s relations with the neighborhood across the Charles took a turn for the worse when Harvard halted construction on the Allston Science Complex in Dec. 2009 due to financial constraints during the economic crisis.
Casey said that University plans to make a final decision on a private development partner for Barry’s Corner in mid-March and will present a more detailed plan for the science center by the end of the academic year.
Throughout the meeting, Task Force members and residents asked for a project time line and a firm promise that the University would not halt construction again. Casey asked for residents’ patience and active participation in selecting a third party developer.
Many residents said they were hesitant to commit an extensive amount of time to another joint planning process after their original plans were not realized.
In an email after the meeting, Casey stressed that Harvard has already dedicated “significant resources” to its science center in Allston.
“[T]his building will represent the single largest investment in a science facility ever made by the university, and the biggest investment in science space envisioned for at least the next decade, if not longer,” Casey wrote. “It is critical that we get it right.”
Residents asked the Boston Redevelopment Authority representatives present at the meeting to secure a commitment from the University.
BRA Chief Planner Kairos Shen said that Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino is committed to ensuring that Harvard follows through on its promises to the Allston community.
“The mayor has two priorities: One is to finish the science center and the second is to develop some of this land over the next two years so that it can help our economic recovery as a city as a whole,” Shen said, adding that Menino has held regular meetings with Harvard administrators.
“If, in October of this year, you are still not satisfied with what the University is telling you about the Science Complex, I guarantee you the mayor won’t be satisfied,” Shen said.
As the meeting drew to a close, Task Force member Harry E. Mattison questioned the effectiveness of previous planning efforts and asked if residents can expect to see “actual shovels in the ground” in the near future.
“Harry, the planning we’ve done led to the approval of Stone Hearth Pizza and Swiss Bakers,” Shen said. “How much we can get done is dependent on how much we can work together. We are humbly asking more of you to sit through more of these so that we can get it right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
City Council members debated how to best address the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s most recent budget deficit at a Cambridge City Council meeting Monday evening. The MBTA has put forward two proposals, both of which include major cuts to MBTA service and sizable fare increases.
The changes, which will increase fares by more than 40 percent, have upset many people in the Boston area.
Councillor E. Denise Simmons said that she opposes the changes to current MBTA service and fares.
“I’m certainly going to continue to keep up my resistance,” said Simmons.
The proposed changes will also cut service on weekends to the college-heavy area along the Green Line’s E line, among other service cuts.
Last week, two high school students came to the City Council meeting to protest a nearly 100 percent increase to weekly student pass fares. Monday, members of the community spoke at the City Council meeting against the proposed fare hikes and service cuts.
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr., who is also a state legislator, said he disagrees with the MBTA’s proposals and that he is concerned that the fare increases will inappropriately target students and senior citizens.
“The irony of this is the MBTA ridership is at its highest [point] in a long time, so we should be encouraging people to take mass transit instead of their automobiles,” Toomey said. “It’s kind of foolish of us to not be putting more money into mass transit.”
After discussing the potential changes to service and fares, the Council decided to arrange for a meeting with the MBTA.
The discussion at the City Council meeting coincided with a rally in Copley Square, which was spearheaded by student groups and Occupy movements from across the Boston area. The rally was followed by a public meeting, hosted by the MBTA, at which citizens could discuss the proposed changes.
“It was very lively today. There were about 200 people in Copley Square in front of the Boston Public Library,” said Jackson F. Cashion ’13, an inactive Crimson editor, who attended the rally. “It brought together many communities in Boston that don’t normally work together.”
Noah D. McKenna, a molecular biologist at the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital, who is a member of Occupy Boston and Occupy the MBTA, said that “no hikes, no cuts” was the rally’s primary message.
McKenna acknowledged that the MBTA is strapped for money, but said he thought that more of the deficit should be filled by funding from the state legislature rather than from MBTA customers.
“The MBTA obviously has their hands tied to some degree,” said McKenna. “We’re using these hearings as rally points, and in the coming months we’ll be shifting these rallies to the State House.”
As they have during every council meeting this year, the councillors again voted, to no avail, for the next mayor. The mayoral position, which is primarily ceremonial, comes with a significant pay increase and a spot on the School Committee. To be elected mayor, a City Councillor needs a majority of the nine members’ votes. As of yet, no one has managed to obtain more than three votes.
Voting changed only slightly from the meeting before, as Councillors Kenneth E. Reeves ‘72 and Craig A. Kelley both voted for Kelley on Monday. Two weeks ago, both voted for Reeves, and last week, Reeves voted for himself, while Kelley was absent. All other votes remained constant.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who received votes from herself and Councillor David P. Maher, said that failing to elect a mayor was a disservice to the city. “Something has to be done to elect a mayor—it’s about doing the business of the people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the morning of Valentine’s Day, more than 2,000 Harvard students checked their email with the hope of finding true love.
During the night, they had received a list of students who could potentially be their destined romantic partners—at least according to a computerized survey known as Datamatch that they had filled out earlier in February.
The survey, written and programmed annually by members of the Harvard Computer Society since 1994, promises to send participants the names and contact information of up to ten of their fellow Harvard students in time for the boldest of survey-takers to arrange lunch or dinner dates—or even both—on Valentine’s Day.
Salvatore R. Rinchiera ’14, a member of the Computer Society who helped create this year’s Datamatch survey, described the questions on the website as “funny and geeky.”
Students searching for love were asked to tell the computer program tidbits like their favorite day (All of the answer choices were “Friday” and linked to a YouTube video of Rebecca Black’s eponymous song.) and the place they do their best work (Options included “In your room. Naked,” and “In someone else’s room. Naked.”).
“We spend most of our time coming up with the questions,” Rinchiera said. “After we narrow it down to the questions for the survey, we match it to personality traits and create a ranking system for the algorithm.”
That mathematical matchmaking formula, much touted in the Computer Society’s emails to the student body advertising Datamatch, is a secret that its programmers keep close to the vest.
“I’m not sure how much I can say about the algorithm,” Rinchiera said. “It has been handed down from year to year and is modified in small ways to keep up with changes in love standards.”
The Computer Society encourages students to fill out the questionnaire even if they are currently in romantic relationships and to provide the names of their significant others on the survey. That way, the programmers can use the information to test how well their match-ups correlate with real pairs.
“It helps us to give the questions different weights in order to reflect those relationships in the final results,” Rinchiera said.
More than 2,000 students received Datamatch results Tuesday, according to Rinchiera, but whether they take action based on the emails they receive is harder to measure.
Jimmy L. Wu ’13 said he “might look them up on Facebook.”
Adam Lee Purvis ’12 said he looked up the women on his list, but he did not plan on asking any of them out. “Most girls would see this as a sketchy avenue to take,” Purvis said. “I’m more old-fashioned and I believe in walking up to a girl I know and asking her out to dinner.”
But at least one Harvard man did seek out dates with the women on his list, sight unseen. Stella F. Chen ’15 said that she received an email from a man on her Datamatch list, addressed to all of his matches.
“Do any of you want to go on a date with me? I cc’d my girlfriend, and she’s all right with it,” the email said, according to Chen.
Chen said she does not plan to take him up on the offer.
But according to Rinchiera, students every year do agree to meet up with their virtual matches. After each Valentine’s Day, Rinchiera said, the Computer Society receives emails from grateful couples who started dating only after learning each other’s names from the amorous algorithm.
“I encourage everyone to contact their Datamatches,” Rinchiera said. “Every year, people come back to us with positive results. There are happy endings.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanks to Jeremy Lin's sudden emergence as a sports and pop culture juggernaut in the past two weeks, Harvard athletics have also been receiving far more attention lately. After all, it's been nearly 60 years since a Crimson hooper suited up for an NBA team.
So what do current Harvard athletes think of Lin’s meteoric rise? To get an athlete’s perspective, we at The Back Page caught up with senior cornerback Matt Hanson.
Hanson, a unanimous first-team All-Ivy selection for his strong 2011 campaign for the Harvard football team, has long been a supporter of the Harvard basketball team. Hanson is a common presence in the stands during home basketball games, as he and other football players have catalyzed fan support around campus. Additionally, the senior has reportedly received looks from NFL scouts.
Through his unique perspective, he was able to give us some interesting insight into the "Linsanity" gripping the campus.
 
The Back Page: Have you been following sports any more than usual now that Jeremy Lin is as big as he is with the Knicks?
Matt Hanson: I’ve kept my sports viewing essentially the same, except I’ve been watching a lot more Knicks games. I mean, I’m a pretty big sports fan, but I’ve definitely watched the past three Knicks games, which I have never done before.
TBP: How do you think this phenomenon has affected Harvard Athletics as a whole?
MH: I think it’s huge when you get a spotlight on any program. It brings in a lot more fans from the outside world that normally wouldn’t watch a Harvard basketball game or a Harvard hockey match. So when you have a lot more outside participation, it’s good publicity-wise and probably money-wise for the programs.
TBP: Do you have a favorite Lin pun?
MH: I don’t know. I think some of them have been pretty racist in my opinion, so I try to hold off on them a little bit. I’m just excited for everything he’s going through, and I’m really excited for him personally.
TBP: What does it mean as an athlete to see another athlete from Harvard succeed on the highest level?
MH: It’s awesome. We come here knowing it’s the ultimate combination of athletics and academics, and to see Jeremy Lin go on and prove how good Harvard athletes can be is awesome for the people that are here and the people that aspire to go on to that next level.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jeremy Lin ’10’s life-changing string of seven days came to a close today with yet another honor, when he was named the NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week.
After averaging 27.3 points and 8.3 assists in his four sensational games as a starter—while leading the previously-lowly Knicks to a 4-0 record—Lin became a national phenomenon and one of the biggest sports stories of the year overnight.
The Harvard alum’s 109 points over those four games were the most scored by any NBA player in his first four starts since the NBA-ABA merger in 1976. Lin also became the first player in NBA history to score at least 20 points with seven assists in each of his first four starts, and the youngest player in NBA history to average at least 25 points and eight assists over a five-game span.
In doing so, his game was praised by three of the best point guards of all time—Magic Johnson, Steve Nash, and Jerry West—while a number of celebrities and national media outlets took an interest in Lin’s compelling story, especially after he outdueled Kobe Bryant to the tune of 38 points on national television Friday night.
With the honor, Lin becomes the first player in NBA history to win Player of the Week awards in both the NBA and the NBA Development League, where he won the award while a member of the Reno Bighorns last season.
Lin is the first Knick to receive the NBA honor this year. Oklahoma City point guard Russell Westbrook won the Western Conference award.
Lin, who will next be in action tomorrow night against the Raptors, was yesterday named the ABC News “Person of the Week” as well.

BOSTON, Mass.—Scoring at TD Garden is something Alex Fallstrom hopes to be doing a lot more of in the future.
At the home of the Boston Bruins—the NHL team that acquired him via trade three years ago—the junior forward scored the go-ahead goal in the second period to help give Harvard (8-7-10, 6-4-8 ECAC) a 3-2 win over Northeastern (11-14-3, 7-12-2 Hockey East) in the Beanpot consolation game Monday night.
It was Fallstrom’s first goal on the ice he one day aspires to call home.
“Hopefully it’s one of many to come,” the junior said.
Though the contest, played in front of a sparse crowd, merely served as an appetizer for the main course of the 60th annual Beanpot—No. 2 Boston University vs. No. 3 Boston College in the championship match—Harvard avoided finishing at the bottom of the city’s collegiate hockey pecking order with the win.
“Coming into the game, there’s just not many fans in the stands, [so] it's kind of a tough game to get up for,” senior forward Alex Killorn said. “But we realized this game’s not only huge for the win, but also going into this weekend.... It’s definitely a momentum swing for us.”
Fallstrom’s goal, his tenth of the season, came with 1:47 to go in the second period. The junior got loose on a breakaway, took a cross-ice pass from freshman Tommy O’Regan, and fired a shot from outside the circle over Huskies goaltender Clay Witt’s left shoulder.
“Tommy was filling in for Marshall Everson, who has played in that position most of the season,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 explained. “We needed somebody to step up and play on that line, and I think he did a good job.”
The goal came just a minute after Crimson freshman goalie Steve Michalek made a diving stop to prevent Northeastern from scoring off a rebound. The rookie netminder would continue his strong play early in the third, making back-to-back kick saves at the eight-minute mark to keep Harvard ahead.
“Steve’s really been huge for us,” Fallstrom said. “He’s come into a real tough position, being a freshman starter. He’s really worked hard, and he’s really grown this year. It’s nice to see.”
Moments later, Harvard junior forward David Valek was called for holding, giving the Huskies a power-play attempt. But it was the Crimson that would score once again.
On a two-on-one, senior Colin Moore sent a perfect cross-ice pass to junior forward Luke Greiner, who ripped a shot from the right side through Witt’s legs to put Harvard up, 3-1. It was the Crimson’s first shorthanded goal since Killorn scored in last season’s Beanpot consolation game.
Still on the power play just 23 seconds later, Northeastern would cut the deficit to one.
Luke Eibler scored his first goal of the season, firing a shot that Michalek attempted to catch but which instead bounced off his glove and into the net behind him.
Now down just a score, Northeastern began to attack the net during the contest’s final six minutes. But despite a number of close calls in the final seconds, Michalek held firm to give the Crimson the win.
“When you’re in the heat of the moment, you don’t really think much,” Fallstrom said. “You just try to keep the puck out of the net, and that’s what we did today.”
Harvard had a number of scoring opportunities early in the contest, with defensemen Danny Ford and Patrick McNally clanking slapshots off the post in the first six minutes.
But the Crimson was able to convert 11:44 into the period, when Killorn took the puck towards the net, made a move to fake out Witt, and taped it past him for his team-leading 16th goal of the year.
“I just snuck into a soft zone right to the left of the goalie,” Killorn said. “Once I got [the puck] their defense kind of slid to Fallstrom.... I was able to put it around [Witt] and sneak it through.”
The Terriers would knot things up 4:07 into the second, when Robbie Vrolyk fired a shot that deflected off Michalek’s shoulder and into the net.
But the freshman would respond with back-to-back saves a moment later to keep Harvard in the lead, which it would not lose the rest of the night.
“When you have as many ties [10, tied for an NCAA record] as we do, it’s important to show that you can finish off a win,” Donato said. “Anytime you can win a one-goal game, I think it brings a lot of confidence to the locker room.”
It was the second consecutive victory in a Beanpot consolation game for the Crimson, which upset then-No. 15 BU in last year’s second round.
That win marked a major turning point in Harvard’s season, propelling a team that came in 4-18-1 to seven wins in its next eight games. The Crimson hopes it can use Monday’s win to build similar momentum for the remainder of this year’s season.
“We saw last year when we beat BU in the same game, it really turned our season around,” Fallstrom said. “Hopefully this win will do the same for us this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON, Mass.—For a team that has made a habit of keeping games close, the Beanpot consolation game between Harvard and Northeastern was not as close as the final score line, 3-2, made it seem.
The main event would come later in the evening, with No. 2 Boston University taking on No. 3 Boston College in the championship. But the matchup between the Crimson (8-7-10, 6-4-8 ECAC) and the Huskies (11-14-3, 7-12-2 Hockey East) provided the spattering of fans that showed up early to TD Banknorth Garden with some excitement.
Harvard is currently tied for the NCAA-record with 10 ties, and, despite dominating Northeastern on both ends of the ice, nearly faced the prospect of heading to its 12th overtime of the season.
GLIMPSE OF THINGS TO COME?
Junior forward Alex Fallstrom scored a pretty second period goal off a pass from freshman Tommy O’Regan who was filling in for injured junior starter Marshall Everson. The goal was the first for Fallstrom in six Beanpot appearances and his first at the home of the Boston Bruins. Fallstrom’s rights were acquired by the Bruins in 2009 after being drafted in the fourth round by the Minnesota Wild.
“It was kind of a broken play in our zone,” Fallstrom said. “I came cutting across the middle and O’Regan hit me with a nice stretch pass. I came across the ice and fired it past the goalie. It definitely felt good to get a goal in the Garden.”
Fallstrom is one of eight players on the Crimson roster belonging to an NHL team, and the goal he fired past Huskies’ goalie Clay Witt was his 10th on the season.
The first score of the game came shortly after a penalty kill, with senior Alex Killorn returning to the ice—after a cross-checking penalty—for a goal. Killorn, the team’s leading scorer, took a pass from O’Regan before deking out Witt and faking a pass to Fallstrom. As the defense shifted to stop Fallstrom, Killorn gently tapped the puck over the line to open up the scoring.
Harvard stayed on the offensive the whole game, attempting to capture the momentum from the get-go.
“Offense feeds energy, [and] guys enjoy scoring goals,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “That lightens up the mood and brings a lot of energy to the game. We really wanted to establish our ability to get pucks on the net. We got almost 40 shots off, hit three posts. [We were just] trying to attack all night.”
The third and final goal for Harvard came when junior Luke Greiner took a pass on the break-away from senior Colin Moore to break a short-handed scoreless streak that reaches back to last year’s Beanpot. Last year’s victory in the consolation game sparked a Crimson run that took it to the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament. A similar run would be much appreciated after an up-and-down season.
“I think last year [the Beanpot] emotionally gave us a lift,” Donato said. “I think this year, coming down the stretch, we’ll go in with a positive feeling coming out of this game.”
MICHA-FLUKE
Freshman goalie Steve Michalek played another solid game between the pipes, and was two fluke goals away from his first clean sheet of the season.
Both of Northeastern’s goals came on plays in which the Glastonbury, Conn. native stopped the puck, only to have it slip out of his grasp and over the line.
The first goal deflected off Michalek’s pad, took a weird bounce, and slide in for a goal. The second came just over a minute after Greiner’s goal, as Michalek stopped the puck with his glove but was unable to get a good enough grip to cover up.
Despite the mistakes, Michalek recorded 24 saves on the night including a flurry of stops in the dying seconds as the Huskies furiously tried to even up the game.
“Steve usually comes up pretty huge at the end of the game,” Killorn said. “I know he made us a few point-blank saves that allowed us to keep the lead.”
Harvard has made a habit of late season surges over the past two years and hasn’t lost a conference contest since Jan. 13 against Union. With four games left before tournament play, the Crimson will try to carry the momentum from today’s game moving forward.
“You’re never really sure how a season will play out at the end of the year,” Donato said. “But this game might be very important with how we are able to take care of business down the stretch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the score tied at three matches apiece, the fate of the Harvard men’s tennis team lay in the hands of Alex Steinroeder. Fortunately for the Crimson, the freshman pulled through in a come-from-behind victory against Patrick Dacieck of Virginia Tech, winning 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, Saturday afternoon at the Murr Tennis Courts.
Although Steinroeder realized that the team’s result depended on his match, he didn’t let the pressure affect him.
“I think it was 5-5 in the third when I found out that it was coming down to my match,” Steinroeder said. “I was a little nervous, but I was a lot less nervous than I thought I would be.... It must have been the adrenaline or something—I was in the zone.”
It took all Steinroeder had to defeat Dacieck, who took a commanding lead over Steinroeder early on in the match. Steinroeder quickly found himself down, 3-0, in the second set after having dropped the first, and although he fought back to tie the match at one set, he again fell behind in the third.
The freshman’s mentality had to change midway through this final set as he saw his teammates fall, one by one.
“I had thought we were going to win the match based on other courts,” Steinroeder said.
But Steinroeder never gave up, and, through meticulous shot selection, broke serve to earn a 6-5 lead in the third set. That was the only separation Steinroeder would need—the rookie went on to take four consecutive points to capture the game, the set, and the match.
This wasn’t the first time that the freshman from Concord, Mass. has come up big for Harvard so far this season. With this win, Steinroeder kept his perfect record in team matches (5-0) intact and improved his overall record to an impressive 16-5.
Crimson co-captain Alistair Felton showed no surprise with how well Steinroeder played, emphasizing the confidence he has in his teammate.
“Alex started doing well in the fall, but he’s playing even better now,” Felton said. “He’s very hard-working. He always knows what shots he wants to practice and goes out and practices them until he’s happy.”
Felton also credits Steinroeder’s dedication to maintaining his fitness level as a major component of the recent victory.
“He’s always doing whatever he needs to do to take care of his body,” Felton said. “And that really showed in the match against Virginia Tech.... [It] lasted for almost three hours, but he didn’t seem tired at all in the end.”
Although this is Steinroeder’s first collegiate season, the rookie is no stranger to winning. Steinroeder led his high school team to a 68-match win streak and two Massachusetts state titles. He also finished his high school career with two individual state singles titles and a 94-2 overall record in matches.
Previous success has translated at the college level so far, and Steinroeder is quick to credit his teammates for the smooth transition.
“We have really good senior leadership,” Steinroeder said. “[The captains] have done a really good job with our freshman and kind of showed us the way to do things.... Coming into school I was pretty nervous that it would be a whole other level, but ... I’ve found that, if you work hard, [the level is] not impossible.”
Steinroeder also noted the importance of camaraderie on the team, citing how it has helped him in team matches so far.
“The college competition is just a lot [of] fun,” Steinroeder said. “You get to play with the team, [so] you have so many people by your side.”
Steinroeder believes this positive team atmosphere is the reason for the Crimson’s success so far this season and its confidence with respect to the future.
“Everyone’s very happy with how we’ve done the last couple of weeks,” Steinroeder said. “It’s really been a good team effort, and everyone’s contributing which gives us a lot of confidence going forward.”
Felton echoed the freshman’s sentiments.
“[The match against the Hokies] is very important because they’re one of the highest ranked teams we’ll play this year,” Felton said. “It gives us the belief that we can beat pretty much any team out there.”
With Steinroeder on the team, it seems that clutch situations are one less thing that Harvard will need to worry about in the coming matches of the season.

If you missed the Grammy Awards on Sunday night, you've probably still heard that British songstress Adele dominated the awards ceremony, going six for six, a feat rivaled only by Beyoncé in 2010.
In other news, Indie folk band Bon Iver won Best New Artist and Best Alternative Album. Other big winners included Foo Fighters and Kanye West, each receiving four golden gramophones.
Besides the dozens of Whitney Houston shout-outs, here are a few of the night's performances that may be of interest, in order of appearance:
Foo Fighters: "Walk"
If you managed to watch this without so much as a fit of head banging or hand clapping, please go to UHS immediately.
Paul McCartney: "My Valentine"
The legendary Beatles member treated everyone to a sweet, poignant ballad.
Jennifer Hudson: "I Will Always Love You"
Chances are you heard this one. Whitney Houston would have been honored to hear this simply breathtaking tribute.
Nicki Minaj: "Roman Holiday"
Leave it to Nicki Minaj to poke fun at an exorcism. She used the stage to explore the trials and tribulations of her alter ego, Roman Zolanski, leaving the rest of us stupefied at best.

Happy Valentine's Day! Here, from the Arts board, is a playlist that is guaranteed to put you and your partner in the mood for love. Or chocolate.
1. Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong: "Dream a Little Dream of Me"
Two of the greatest jazz singers singing a romantic duet that actually encourages dirty dreams. Does it get any more magical than that?
2. Billie Holiday: "I'll Be Seeing You"
This song is featured in the ultimate chick flick, "The Notebook," during a scene in which Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams throw caution to the wind and dance in the middle of the street. The song's soulful horns and lingering melody would be the last sounds anyone would want to hear were a car to come careening down the road.
3. The Airborne Toxic Event: "The Book of Love"
The normally explosive T.A.T.E. covered this romantic The Magnetic Fields ballad at a concert in Walt Disney Concert Hall and inspired so many lovers that they have since incorporated the song into their set list.
4. Madonna: "Crazy For You"
A song that our parents probably danced to at some high school dance and then...
5. of Montreal: "Gallery Piece"
This take on love is passionate, violent, and, well, scary. When Kevin Barnes sings, "I wanna crash your car / I wanna scratch your cheeks / I wanna make you sick," he no doubt causes thousands of listeners to want an intimate relationship with him.
6. Michael Bublé: "Haven't Met You Yet"
For those who do not have a Valentine and are instead celebrating Singles Awareness Day, listen to this song as you give yourself a hug. Hey, you get to eat the whole box of chocolates by yourself.

Love and chocolate were in the air on Monday night as freshmen gathered in Annenberg Dining Hall and kicked off their Valentine's Day celebrations with "Flirting with Faust." Hosted by the First Year Social Committee (FYSC), the event featured music, sweets, and every Harvard student's dream valentine—University President Drew G. Faust herself.
Chocolate flowed in abundance from two fountains, and freshmen took turns dipping Oreos, strawberries, and marshmallows. After helping themselves to a variety of "mocktails," students then had a chance to make Valentines using construction paper, glitter, stickers, and heart-shaped paper doilies provided by the event. "I think it's cool because otherwise I wouldn't have done anything [for Valentine's Day]," Taylor M. duPont '15 said of the event.
President Faust and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67 were both on hand to chat with students and even posed for pictures. "I think a lot of people are excited to hang out with [President Faust] and see that there's a face behind the name," said Ting-Ting Liu '15, a member of FYSC who helped organize the event.
And if President Faust was her Valentine? "I would get her a couple body guards, because she's clearly a VIP wherever she goes," said Liu.
Later in the evening, it was time for the "Flirt Game Show"—FYSC's take on "The Dating Game." Linda Trujano '15 participated and got to choose between three male contestants after hearing their answers to a series of questions. "His answers were a lot cuter and funnier than the other ones," she said of Ryan M. Rule '15, the contestant she selected to take on a date. "We are going to the Faculty Club for dinner." The game's three other lucky couples walked away with a free meal, as well.
Even for those freshmen who are still flying solo this Valentine's, the evening served as a reminder that a chocolate fountain is a great place to drown your sorrows.
