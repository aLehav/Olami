[Editor's note: DC Comics' "The New 52" initiative aims to bring a new audience into the DC Universe by rebooting or significantly changing all of their superheroes and restarting them back at issue #1. In this series, the comic book newbies of The Crimson attempt to evaluate the quality and accessibility of The New 52.   —Brian Feldman, Arts Web Editor]
The first issue of “Detective Comics” I ever read was published 27 years before I was born (Issue #345 The Blockbuster Invasion of Gotham City). I like comic books that start and end in a single issue. I like solid artwork where the superheroes are larger than life but not steroid junkies or Picasso melt-aways. But reading DC’s new “Detective Comics” #1 was quite the new experience. The journey begins with some introspection about the Joker, and then quickly transitions to a lengthy action sequence.
The first scene with The Joker is actually quite confusing—it shows Batman's nemesis struggling with an unknown man. What follows is some strained dialogue that isn't entirely comprehensible, with lots of “Crash”, “Whump” and “Shhock” sound effects adding to the pandemonium and overwhelming chaos of the introduction.
Batman clearly represents a darker section of the DC universe so it is to be expected that the imagery is much darker in regard to coloring and tone. The opening images of blood and gore are actually quite vivid and frightening.
Disturbingly, the body count grows very quickly; the amount of destruction and violence inflicted on innocent bystanders leads this comic down a particularly dark path. Once Batman enters the picture and takes on the Joker, the fighting becomes easier [easier how?]. Batman chases the Joker throughout the night, with Batcave, Alfred, and Commissioner Gordon making appearances along the way.
The story is both strong and exciting at points and the artwork makes the action easy to follow. However, as much as DC is trying to reboot the series to readers without any prior knowledge, writer Tony Daniel gives vague insight into Alfred and Commissioner Gordon. Even though the relevance of these characters is not fully explained or examined, careful attention to dialogue gives the reader only the essential knowledge. Daniel does a decent job describing Batman’s substantial physique and determination through Batman’s inner thoughts. For example, after being stabbed twice, he thinks to himself, “No vital organs, but the pain is searing.”
Much like “The Dark Knight,”—where viewers could not get enough of Health Ledger’s version of The Joker—the portrayal of The Joker here is intense, especially when comparing and contrasting the insanity of the Joker with the morality of Batman. In one passage, when The Joker is finally beaten down to the ground he simply laughs and says, “What a ride.”
Likewise, “Detective Comics” #1 is indeed a ride that ends with a gory, unexpected cliffhanger, further showcasing The Joker’s genius and insanity [w/c see above]. For an entry point into the Batman mythos, the issue is compelling due to its frantic action and intriguing finale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is something very Potemkin-like about the idea of an institution sponsoring the protest of its own policy. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia has been accused of siring ersatz opposition parties in order to solidify the hegemony of the ruling United Russia party, and both Democrats and Republicans here at home have been known to support the use of oxymoronic “free speech zones” at their national conventions. One would hardly expect, however, for an institution purporting to, in the words of the College’s mission statement, “[encourage] students to respect ideas and their free expression, and to rejoice in discovery and in critical thought” to embrace this borderline Orwellian practice.
And yet, in our view, that is aptly descriptive of what transpired last Tuesday night on the steps of Memorial Church, when University President Drew G. Faust addressed “DADT Repeal Speak Out” just hours after leading the very event—the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Naval Reserve Officer’s Training Corps office in the Student Organization Center in Hilles—that the former was designed to protest. The incongruity of the spectacle was best encapsulated by attendee and lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93: “The University is in a bit of pickle or queer situation where they have to mark both [NROTC’s return and students’ dissent].”
The student dissent for which the Speak Out was intended to serve as an outlet concerned the administration’s decision to, in light of Tuesday’s expiration of the military’s eight-year-old “don’t ask don’t tell” policy, re-embrace NROTC in spite of the persisting prohibition on the enlistment of transgender individuals. However, the strategic management of student dissent by the College was in fact an act of suppression of such dissent, as the Speak Out was deliberately scheduled far away from and long after the ribbon-cutting ceremony, discouraging students from voicing their opinions at the real event itself. Furthermore, the very fact that the protest was University-sponsored implies that it was, in the end, little more than a fruitless sideshow. This practice is expected of political parties at home and abroad, but we expect better from a university administration.
The unencumbered manifestation of student dissent may at times be ugly to see, but the unequivocal permission of it is a pillar upon which this university—and indeed the ideal of free expression in general—is founded. Especially critical is for free expression to be unencumbered at an event celebrating the United States Armed Forces, whose members swear in their Oath of Enlistment to, among other things, “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” Let us never forget that the First Amendment to that Constitution guarantees the right of those who would wish to protest at an event commemorating those who fight to uphold their right to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s sex signals has come and gone, and, like every September, freshmen sit through two sessions that fail to answer the most important question about sexual violence on campus. What do you do if it happens to you?
This information is not found in either the visiting presentation or the workshop that follows. Instead, freshmen are only told to contact the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response in case of problems. How to go through the process of taking care of oneself after an attack and prosecuting is never addressed.
“We don’t go into great detail because we don’t have a lot of time and because the concrete specifics tend to not be remembered,” says Sarah Rankin, director of the OSAPR. “We try to hammer home the places that we hope that you will go to if and when you need that information.”
But what about information that is crucial to know on the spot? While one can bring a complaint to the Administrative Board at any time, delay can make a criminal claim more difficult, not only because material evidence deteriorates and witnesses forget details, but because the appearance of wavering on the part of the victim can be used by the defense to weaken the allegation that a crime occurred.
So, here’s what you do if you are sexually assaulted and may wish to make a claim to the Ad Board or in a criminal court. First, don’t do anything that will alter your body chemistry—shower, brush your teeth, or go to the bathroom. “Think like a crime scene detective,” says Gina Scaramella of the Boston Rape Crisis Center. “Preserve all the evidence,” She says. You should get a medical evidence collection kit done at Beth Israel hospital, the nearest medical institution certified for such an examination. An OSAPR staff member can accompany you. A medical examination is crucial even if you do not plan to use it for prosecuting purposes. Trained professionals will check you for hidden injuries, STIs and advise you on the morning after pill, if necessary. Rankin says the records will be kept for several months to a year. So, even if you are unsure about taking judicial action, get one done, and you will be healthier for it.
If the assault happened on Harvard property, it falls under Harvard University Police jurisdiction. HUPD detectives will be in charge of compiling evidence, says Rankin. The quicker you go to them, the “fresher” the evidence, Rankin says. Remember, when talking to police, to give “a complete picture,” according to Jennifer G. Long, Director of the AEquitas: The Prosecutors’ Resource on Violence Against Women. If this is someone you know—has he or she been violent before? What were your interactions leading up to the incident? Who did you talk to immediately following? Write down anything you can remember about the incident as quickly as possible.
You have several options to report the crime: the Administrative Board or the criminal justice system (or both at once), Rankin says. Know the standards and procedures for each. The Ad Board evaluates students’ claims by “well-established standards and the specific rules and policies established by the Faculty” according to the student handbook. The process involves getting a whole picture of the event and the aftermath. Information is compiled by independent fact finders, though “information the police investigation uncovered could be accessed by the Board if the students brought it forward, ” Dean John “Jay” L. Ellison, head of the board, writes in an email. Important to know is that the board does not discriminate against cases brought late—the Board has heard cases more than 18 months after the event, Ellison writes.
The criminal court holds the standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt,” a high standard meaning it may be hard to prosecute successfully. If you go forward with a criminal case, you might wish to be paired with a victim advocate who will educate you on the process and might alleviate common difficulties of criminal cases, such as their length, Long says by phone.
Throughout this process, you should be talking to a lawyer, though lawyers cannot be admitted in the Ad Board procedures or represent you there. This lawyer should, among other things, inform you of your rights within the school. Know that if you file a complaint at Harvard, the school is obligated to investigate it immediately. Harvard may not force you to change classes or pressure you to “wait on it” (more rights can be found on the ACLU website).
Finally, remember that if you are a victim of a sexual crime, your case is not just a matter of hearsay—it can be built on solid foundations. “These cases can be very difficult...they have a lot dynamics that may seem very difficult to overcome.” says Long. “[But] in these cases, there is always something more. There are questions we can ask and things we can learn.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There probably aren’t many things ex-Vice President Cheney and liberal comedian Bill Maher agree on, but one view both men apparently share is that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would have made a better president than the incumbent commander-in-chief. Cheney, along with a not-insignificant number of overindulged liberal discontents, has even suggested that a primary challenge to President Obama by the former first lady in 2012 would be a good idea. To be sure, a second Clinton-Obama battle would be a stupid idea, but it’s curious that Maher and so many of his ilk now find themselves joining hands with their ex-nemesis in their newfound affinity for Clinton.
Cheney contends that “Perhaps she might have been easier for some of us who are critics of the president to work with,” while Maher claims that “She would never have thought, like Obama seems to think, that he can win [Republicans] over, negotiate with them.” Needless to say, these two visions of a hypothetical Clinton presidency are incompatible. At least one of the competing camps—both, in my opinion—is out of their minds. But given that Cheney probably doesn’t have the Democrats’ best interests at (mechanical) heart, it’s likelier that the liberal Clinton-yearners are the ones who’re divorced from reality.
The leftist complaint against the Obama presidency is predicated on the delusion that the country elected a progressive champion but received a pusillanimous appeaser at best and corporatist sellout at worst. While Obama has neither campaigned nor governed as any of these things but has done both as, above all else, a long-view liberal pragmatist with a penchant for (unsuccessful) conciliation, it’s astonishing that the same people bewailing the president’s moderation are also braying for another Clinton campaign. How soon they forget.
How soon they forget Clinton’s ignominious defense of lobbyists at the 2007 YearlyKos convention. How soon they forget Clinton’s tawdry advocacy for a flag-burning ban. How soon they forget Clinton out-hawking Obama on the issue of engaging foreign leaders without preconditions. How soon they forget why, in 2006 and 2007 respectively, the National Journal ranked Obama the tenth and first most liberal senator, while it ranked Clinton 32nd and 16th most liberal. How soon they forget that Clinton voted for the Patriot Act and Iraq War Resolution. And how soon they forget how it was her failure to apologize for the latter that cost her the nomination in the first place.
A frequent critique of the Obama administration made by disgruntled liberals is that of its over-reliance on the Rubinical duumvirate of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and, until recently, Harvard economics Professor Lawrence Summers, both protégés of ex-Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin ’60. Other high-level Clinton administration alumni include both Obama chiefs of staff—ex-Deputy Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and ex-Commerce Secretary William Daley—and the current Defense Secretary, ex-Clinton Chief of Staff Leon Panetta. Oh, and then there’s the sitting secretary of state herself.
In light of this, it’s not unreasonable to posit that Obama’s first term has been largely indistinguishable from many’s conception of a Clinton third term. But how is it logical to argue then that an actual third Clinton term would not be so? In fact, with the ex-triangulator-in-chief himself again sauntering around the White House halls, how would it not be even more so? Have liberals forgotten the North American Free Trade Agreement? The Defense of Marriage Act? “Don’t ask don’t tell”? Welfare reform? School uniforms? The invention of the “Sistah Souljah moment”?
Why have so many liberals projected their fantasies onto Hillary Clinton rather than an actual liberal firebrand like ex-Vermont Governor Howard Dean or ex-North Carolina Senator John Edwards, the only major candidate in 2008 to campaign as the sort of fire-breathing populist for which liberals seem to be lusting? How could a White House containing Clinton consigliere Mark Penn ’76 instead of Obama confidant David Axelrod be a more forceful advocate for the liberal agenda?
Granted, I don’t identify myself as a liberal or anything approximating one, so I don’t actually want a more forceful advocate for the liberal agenda in the White House. But conservatives subscribing to Cheney’s view are just as delusional as liberals subscribing to Maher’s, as they flippantly elide Clinton’s history as the hated archenemy of the right. Have they forgotten Hillarycare, the “vast rightwing conspiracy,” and the fact that the only substantive difference between Clinton and Obama in 2008 was that her healthcare plan was even more liberal than his?
This cresting wave of Clinton nostalgia, regardless of its ideological origin, is as predictable as it is trite. Were it still Senator Obama, he would doubtlessly be undergoing the same process of beatification Arizona Senator John McCain underwent upon losing to President Bush and Clinton is undergoing now. McCain’s stature rose as Bush’s fell, just as Obama’s would have as President Hillary Clinton inevitably stumbled. Those who pine for her now, be they liberals reimagining this calculating queen of the status quo as their champion or conservatives whitewashing her past as the most polarizing figure in American politics, are doing nothing more than peddling the cliché that the grass is always greener on the other side.

Harvard’s Black Community Leaders and other student groups held a vigil for inmate Troy Davis on Thursday, just a day after last-minute efforts—including a letter drafted by the Harvard Black Men’s Forum—failed to prevent Davis’s execution in Georgia.
Forty Harvard students gathered at 12:03 p.m. and again at 1:03 p.m. to join together in a moment of silence for Davis, whose case drew international attention after doubts were raised as to whether Davis was rightfully convicted in what opponents said was a racially-charged case.
BCL Co-Chair Ijeoma B. Eboh ’12 said that the vigil was organized the night before, in order to demonstrate broad support of the sentiments expressed in the BMF letter.
“[The BCL’s] purpose is really to organize the black community around large things that don’t pertain to a specific group,” she said.
Eboh went on to say that individuals were encouraged to “[wear] all black as a sign of solidarity to the injustice of the execution,” and the moment of silence was meant as a way to honor Davis.
To diversify attendance at the vigil, information about the event was circulated over House open lists last night, in addition to black student organization lists.
In 1991, Davis was sentenced to death for the 1989 murder of police officer Mark MacPhail. He always maintained his innocence, and seven of nine non-police witnesses later recanted their statements. Some witnesses indicated that a different man had confessed to the shooting.
After delaying the execution for four hours while they considered his appeal, the Supreme Court ultimately denied the request, and Davis was put to death at 11:08 p.m.
As students gathered in a circle outside the Science Center, BCL Co-Chair Oluwadamilola “Dammy” T. Akinfenwa ’12 gave a brief speech before the moment of silence began.
“We are going to take a moment now to remember Troy Davis,” he said, as brightly colored umbrellas opened to shield the black-clad attendees from the rain. After a few minutes of silence, the vigil dispersed and attendees went off to class.
Vigil attendee Kayla M. Shelton ’13 said she found the events of the previous several days difficult to swallow.
“It’s kind of been a shocker for me,” said Shelton.
She went on to say that, because she is not involved in activist organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the fact that the execution took place was “startling.”
The day before, Shelton attempted to fax the BMF’s protest letter to the team that was to administer Davis’ lethal injection. The fax did not go through, however, because other supporters clogged the lines.
“I was more heartened by how many people are in support of [Davis],” she said. “[The execution] sounds more like vengeance than justice.”
“It’s something that you’d never think would happen in today’s society, but history repeats itself,” Shelton added.
For Akinfenwa, that sentiment goes hand in hand with the point of the vigil.
“[The vigil happened] because it is a good idea to remind people that there are things outside of Harvard going on,” he said. “At the end of the day, this is an issue that affects everyone.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have awarded a four-year $20 million grant to researchers at the School of Public Health to study HIV prevention in Botswana as part of a President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) initiative.
The Harvard researchers will investigate whether the combination of treating HIV-positive patients early and providing voluntary male circumcision and care for pregnant women with HIV can successfully control the epidemic, according to co-principal investigator Victor De Gruttola, an HSPH biostatistics professor.
Rather than randomly selecting individuals to participate in the study, the researchers will randomly select 16 different villages in Botswana to examine the community-level effects of intervention.
“You know the individual parts of a car may work well, but you don’t know if it will still work when you put all the parts together,” Gruttola said. “And that’s what we need to learn.”
The researchers will also attempt to increase the rate at which people are tested for and informed of their HIV status, Gruttola said.
Meanwhile, a subset of the study will focus on viral genetic sequencing to determine the transmission chains of the virus.
“We are trying to find out where the holes are so we can plug them,” Gruttola said. “And one of the challenges will be, as we learn throughout the course of the study, [finding out] what works and what doesn’t.”
The current outline of the study is based on the proposal submitted to the CDC as part of the application. The researchers will work jointly with the CDC to develop a final plan.
Researchers and the CDC will meet to create a definitive course of action on Sept. 30 in Atlanta.
The researchers have already completed a prototype of the study in the village of Mochudi in Botswana with funding from the National Institutes of Health.
The Harvard team will be collaborating with the Botswana-Harvard Partnership, a division of the HSPH AIDS Initiative led by HSPH Professor Max Essex, the lead principal investigator for the study.
In addition to supporting the HSPH study, PEPFAR pledged a total of $25 million to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Johns Hopkins University in an effort to examine the efficacy of combination strategies in preventing HIV, according to the PEPFAR website.
“It’s really a wonderful thing that the United States has committed the resources, particularly in difficult times, to identify the best way of controlling HIV in sub-Saharan Africa,” Gruttola said.

Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow has authorized an investigation into managerial practices at the Law School after a delegation of custodial workers went to her office and submitted a letter of complaint about what they called “new and discriminatory policies.”
The alleged practices, according to the letter, include unfairly firing longtime workers and requiring workers who speak Spanish to learn English.
“People have been told they are no longer allowed to be seen not working,” said Jeb Mays, an interpreter who accompanied the delegation to Minow’s office. “That they are not able to buy food from the cafe or sit down or that they are not allowed into the new building. And longtime workers have been told that they are gone for no reason.”
Workers also say that they are being discriminated against because they speak Spanish.
“A major issue is that workers have been told that they have to learn English or that they will no longer have a job,” said Wayne M. Langley, the director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, the union that represents Harvard custodial workers. “As we understand the law, if the job doesn’t require English they can’t discriminate against non-English speakers. As one worker said to me, ‘My bucket doesn’t need English.’”
The Law School said that they responded to the complaint almost immediately after it was presented by the delegation.
“After receiving the letter on Friday, the Law School referred the matter to the appropriate labor relations staff at the University for review and follow-up,” Robb London, a spokesperson for the Law School, said in a statement. “An inquiry is now underway, in accordance with the applicable University policies and procedures.”
Kevin Galvin, a spokesperson for the University, said that the nature of the complaint has made it a high priority for University labor officials.
“We take allegations of discrimination very seriously,” Galvin said in a statement. “Representatives of the Law School and the University’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations are meeting directly with union representatives and the staff members involved in order to gather information about the complaint.”
While workers were initially doubtful about whether the University would act promptly, Langley said he has so far been pleased with the Law School’s quick response.
“We’ve made clear certain issues and they’ve agreed to look into them,” Langley said. “We’re very happy with how it’s worked out.”
Langley said that workers and the Law School Labor relations staff will continue to work together in order to promote a smooth and expedient investigation.
Workers said in the letter that they believe the origins of the new policies to be a Law School administrator hired approximately six months ago, just before the changes took place.
The internal investigation comes as Local 615 and the University are negotiating a new contract for the custodial workers. But Langley said that, at this point, the investigation should not affect the coming discussions.
“They are taking this very seriously. We really appreciate that,” Langley said. “When we go to the [negotiation table], things should be pretty smooth.”

A committee of five Government faculty members will conduct a comprehensive review of the undergraduate concentration, the second largest at the College, this semester.
The committee, headed by government professor Steven R. Levitsky, plans to hold meetings with concentrators, pre-concentrators, and graduate advisors over the course of the fall semester before submitting its findings in March.
Levitsky identified advising and access to faculty, two potentially weak areas in the large department, as possible subjects of the review.
The review comes at a time when the concentration is facing low student satisfaction ratings. In the senior exit survey of the Class of 2010, the Government Department ranked fourth lowest of all concentrations that provided data, receiving a grade of 3.92 out of 5—significantly below the College mean of 4.18.
But Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch, who is also on the review committee, said it is standard practice for departments to hold periodic reviews of their undergraduate and graduate programs. The reviews, she said, are conducted to “make sure the curriculum fits with the college environment ... and to make sure that it is still current in terms of asking students to learn what’s important in that field.”
“It’s basically time to do a review,” Welch said.
The newly-formed internal committee will follow up on an outside evaluation of both the graduate and undergraduate programs conducted in the spring, according to Welch.
Other members include Professors Eric A. Beerbohm, Jennifer L. Hochschild, and Jeffry A. Frieden.
With 291 concentrators—in addition to undeclared freshmen and sophomores who plan to concentrate in government—handling the needs of individual students has always been a challenge.
“We are not only a big concentration, but also an incredibly diverse concentration,” Levitsky said. “We have students who want to get degrees in political science, we have [Institute of Politics] junkies ... and we have a large number of students who are jocks, who are in here because it affords them a certain amount of flexibility.”
In conducting the review, the committee hopes to learn from Social Studies, a large concentration known to have strong advising, Levitsky said.
The structure of the undergraduate advising program has been particularly scrutinized in recent years. The department switched to a House-based system in 2006 and initiated a peer concentration counselor program last year that went under-utilized.

Security guards reached a tentative contract agreement on Thursday with their employer Securitas after a week of heated discussions during which guards said they would go on strike if they were not allowed retain their union health care plan.
Leaders within SEIU Local 615, the union which represents Harvard security guards, said that they were very pleased with the five-year agreement, which stipulated a 15.3 percent wage increase over five years, an increased number of full-time jobs, and protection of their current health care coverage.
“I think the company and the union see this as an initial step towards a more cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship in the future,” Wayne M. Langley, the director of higher education for Local 615, said.
Securitas did not return calls for comment. The University does not comment on negotiations with Securitas.
The negotiations started off smoothly but took a rocky turn when Securitas introduced a proposal that would have reduced health care benefits, which proved to be the sticking point in talks between SEIU and the security firm.
Security guards were outraged at the proposal, which would have stripped them of their union health care plan, and began circulating a petition expressing willingness to strike over the new health care provisions. Over 80 percent of security guards signed the petition, which was formally presented to the bargaining committee on Monday.
Now that the threat of a strike has passed, Wayne M. Langley, the director of higher education for Local 615, said he is hopeful that this will mark the beginning of calmer relations between the union and Securitas.
“In the end, both parties put aside our differences and did what was right for the guards,” Langley said.
Security guards will formally vote to ratify the contract on Wednesday.
Securitas guards said that they were excited that their bargaining committee agreed upon a contract and relieved that a strike had been averted.
“I’m very happy that an agreement’s been reached,” said security guard Shawn Lynch. “Everybody wants to have a peaceful work environment. You want to feel supported by your employer.”
While Lynch said that he will not know the specifics of the contract until the union meets on Wednesday, he is confident that it will be satisfactory.
“I have full confidence in our bargaining committee,” Lynch said. “They’ve worked hard for us.”
Student labor activist William P. Whitham ’14, a member of Student Labor Action Movement, said he was happy that a strike had been averted and that the two parties were able come to an agreement.
“Security guards are obviously a very important part of this institution. It would be very bad if they were not around,” Whitham said. “I’m glad they were willing to strike, but I would rather see a fair, just compromise be reached.”
Whitham said that the current contract agreement, coupled with the agreement Harvard has with dining hall workers, reflects well on the University.
“Like with the dining hall workers, it says a lot about our institution that it treats its workers fairly,” he said.

As Palestine makes its bid for statehood at the United Nations, Palestinian-Canadian attorney Diana Buttu, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, spoke about the challenges facing Palestine at a well-attended lunchtime event at the Belfer Center Thursday.
Buttu discussed five main aspects of the anticipated move by Palestinian authorities to request recognition from the U.N., ranging from Palestine’s history to the implications of the statehood bid for U.S. international relations.
According to Buttu, both internal and external factors have shaped Palestine’s desire for recognition.
Among these factors is the Arab Spring, which has made it “very difficult for Palestinian leadership to be continually seen as an extension of the U.S. or Israeli government. Palestinian [leaders] have to do something different,” Buttu said.
Internally, Buttu said Palestine has faced “complete stagnation” and delays in “elections and municipal elections.” These weaknesses in governance have created a situation in which “Palestinian leadership had to show it was being responsive” and possessed some form of “legitimacy,” Buttu said.
Buttu also said that under current President Mahmoud Abbas of the Fatah party, interest in the bid for statehood has increased, and Palestine has become more defiant.
She criticized U.S. policy toward Palestine, saying that the U.S. has “missed the mark when it comes to the Arab Spring and also Palestine” and that Palestine is “willing to defy” the U.S.
Buttu also noted that some Palestinians are displeased with the current move to request U.N. recognition.
“The bid was put forward without much public opinion. There hasn’t been broad based representation,” Buttu said.
Beyond the Palestinians, Buttu explained that many Israelis were also unhappy with the bid for statehood.
“The idea of Palestinian statehood cuts very deeply into Israeli slogans of ‘There shall never be Palestinian statehood,’” Buttu said.
Buttu’s talk drew some individuals who disagreed with her position.
Adam M. Butensky ’13, who characterizes himself as pro-Israel, said he attended the talk to hear a different perspective on the current controversy. Nonetheless, he said he felt that Buttu misrepresented some facts.
He added that though he supports the creation of a Palestinian state, he believes the request to the U.N. will undermine peace negotiations between the governments of Israel and Palestine.
“There’s a lot of support for the statehood bid because people recognize that the Palestinians should have their own state. Israeli activists agree, but we don’t think the best way to do that is to circumvent negotiation,” he said. “There is a right wing that does say no to a Palestinian state, but they’re right wing. Moderates and Liberals do advocate for a Palestinian state.”
Despite the heated arguments concerning the bid for a Palestinian state, Buttu said she believes that whether or not statehood is granted, conditions in Palestine will remain largely unchanged.

Providing physicians with live information on current rates of infection can help them make more accurate diagnoses of illnesses, according to a study published by Harvard researchers earlier this week.
By disseminating real-time statistics on local infections, the medical system could potentially reduce the number of doctor visits and the unnecessary use of antibiotics for uninfected individuals, while preventing complications for those who actually are sick.
The study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, was conducted by Harvard Medical School Professor of Pediatrics Dr. Kenneth D. Mandl, along with HMS Assistant Professor of Pediatrics Dr. Andrew M. Fine ’91 and Dr. Victor Nizet, a professor at the University of California, San Diego.
The researchers examined 82,000 patient cases gathered from CVS MinuteClinics—small medical clinics located within CVS stores—where all patients’ symptoms are tested and recorded.
The study found that monitoring rates of infection allowed physicians to use local incidence of strep throat in order to better understand the probability that an individual was actually sick. If there was a high incidence rate in the area, then the chances that an individual had the infection increased.
If there was a low rate of incidence, then the probability of infection dropped.
“We identified this application and put together this data set in a unique way that allowed us to see how data from a population can be used for individual clinical cases,” said Mandl.
Mandl explained that if such data were used to increase the likelihood of a correct diagnosis, then it could potentially also be used to improve the efficiency of medical treatment.
“Getting the right care at the right time is going to benefit individuals and society,” Mandl explained.
Mandl has been working in the field of biosurveillance—the transmission of information about disease outbreaks from hospitals to the government—for over a decade.
According to Mandl, it is currently difficult for physicians to quickly get access to information collected about communicable diseases’ incidence.
“We want to bring a degree of situational awareness to the doctor,” Fine said.
Mandl currently serves as the co-director of the Substitutable Medical Apps Reusable Technologies project at Harvard, a federally funded program which seeks to develop infrastructure to allow real-time information to be delivered directly to health care providers.
The SMART project is seeking to develop this infrastructure by creating an “iPhone-like” application, through which doctors could access information and statistics about regional infection rates.

When Mark F. Atiyeh ’14 took a bite of his first turkey sandwich of the school year in Currier House Dining Hall, he realized something tasted different.
“It was an eye-opening experience,” he said. “The sandwich was always very salty last year, but now it tastes so much better and healthier.”
In response to information recently released by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health on the harmful impact of high sodium intake, Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services has worked to reduce the overall sodium on its menus by 25 percent.
The change in the brand of deli meats to Hormel Natural Choice—which is low in sodium, has no artificial colors or flavors, and is gluten and preservative free—is the latest step towards this goal.
“We closely follow [the Department of Nutrition’s] work and partner with them to make our menus healthier,” HUHDS Spokesperson Crista Martin said.
According to the Department of Nutrition, Americans on average consume one-and-a-half (3,000 mg) or more teaspoons of salt a day, which exceeds the recommended daily intake of 2,300 milligrams.
Furthermore, those at high risk of health problems from salt should limit sodium intake to 1,500 milligrams. Nearly 70 percent of U.S. adults possess a high-risk factor, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or age over 40.
A high-sodium diet can raise one’s risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.
Besides the deli meats, Martin said HUHDS has modified its recipes and communicated with vendors about minimizing sodium.
Atiyeh said he is conscious about his sodium intake, and his main diet consists mostly of salads, fruits, and proteins like white eggs, fish, chicken, and turkey.
Since the change in deli meats, Atiyeh said he has been eating turkey sandwiches about two to three times a week.
“You can feel the difference in the taste,” he said.
But Mark R. Theilmann ’12, who was eating a turkey sandwich in Quincy House Dining Hall, said he did not notice a change in deli meats, although he added that he does not usually eat sandwiches. Theilmann also said he does not read the nutrition facts before choosing his meal.
“I just try to stay away from food like chicken fingers,” he said.
Likewise, Stephen L. Kent ’14 also said the deli meats tasted the same as last year. Kent, a clarinetist in the Harvard University Band, said he eats sandwiches about four times a week from Flyby and at football games.
“I care about saturated and trans fat, but not sodium,” Kent said.
Kent said he checked the nutrition facts online once before when someone told him that clam chowder and Alfredo sauce were unhealthy. Since discovering that these two items are high in calories and fat, he said he has been trying to avoid them.
“Sodium is something one can add to taste, but you can’t take it away when it’s already in a recipe or food,” Martin said, adding that she hopes to provide options for students so they can make healthier choices.

Color Labs Inc. CEO Bill Nguyen plans to test his new smartphone and Facebook application—an innovative take on visual connectivity called Color for Facebook—exclusively at Harvard College, commonly regarded as the birthplace of modern social networking.
Nguyen described Harvard students as “on an island. Much activity comes from Harvard, and we hope we learn a lot from you guys.”
Users with the app—which will be released to Harvard students for free starting today—will be able to share their surroundings with Facebook friends in new ways. Any user can post a photo of their current location on Facebook, and friends will have the option to request a “visit,” which, if accepted, will direct them to a live streaming video from the host’s iPhone or Android phone camera.
“[I see] all of these pictures being posted in our feed, but I really want to engage with my friends, I want to experience it with them,” Nguyen said. “With ‘visits,’ all your friends are with you all the time.”
Nguyen’s Silicon Valley based company unveiled the new product at Facebook’s F8 developer’s conference in San Francisco on Thursday.
Color Labs originally considered releasing a test-version of the app to final club members only, according to Ashley M. Kang ’12, who was contacted by the company to see if her final club would be interested. But privacy issues prompted the company to instead open the product to the entire student body at the College.
“This could revolutionize how photos are used and how we approach social media,” Kang said. “[Color for Facebook] has the potential to do something much bigger than it did with its initial launch.”
In March, the company released a different photo-sharing app, branded Color. Despite a groundswell of buzz in the tech community leading up to the release, the product failed to maintain a sufficiently large user base, in part because the app attempted to create social network independent of existing platforms. As a result, Nguyen said the company shifted its focus to receiving continuous feedback from a small pool of users during the initial stages of the new app.
“Unless it works for [Harvard], we’re not going to let anyone ever get it,” Nguyen said. “We’re literally going to figure out everything at Harvard.”
The launch was one of several announcements made at Facebook’s F8 Developers Conference. Facebook bolstered its platform by moving beyond its signature “like” button, previewing the addition of new features called “verbs”—one of which will be “visit.”
Harvard students will receive an email with a link to download the app through various Harvard listservs starting on Friday. Students can also access the app by dialing **color, Nguyen said.
Peter A. Boyce II ’12-’13, who acted as a consultant for the company on the technology culture at Harvard, said he thinks the school is a good testing ground for the app due to its relatively small and concentrated student population.
“The one potential downside is that Harvard isn’t as smartphone-heavy ... there are a lot of Blackberry users,” Boyce said. “That said, if you look at the way other apps have spread around campus, things can go pretty viral in Harvard’s network, especially when something has a tight link to Facebook.”
Earlier this year, major venture capital firms Sequoia, Bain Capital, and Silicon Valley Bank invested around $41 million in Color Labs—a cash infusion that has given the company the financial security to develop the new Color for Facebook app.
But the lingering impressions from the bust of Color’s first launch have left some with reservations. Jason Kincaid, a writer for Techcruch—an online publication specializing in tech start-ups—said he previewed the app earlier this week and noted that the new product will need to prove its worth to users.
“The key question for me at this point—does Color provide the hook to get people interested in the first place?” Kincaid said. “Do we need a better way to see Facebook photos?”
Those questions may be answered as Harvard students test the new app in coming weeks. In the meantime, Nguyen and his co-workers will be constantly monitoring their new creation, keeping all eyes on Harvard’s social networks.
“Every once in a while we get an opportunity to change social norms,” Nguyen said. “If it works at Harvard, it will work everywhere.”

This coming week, the South Asia Initiative at Harvard will sponsor a visit from Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the eleventh president of India, in which the former head of state will speak about leadership, scientific advancement, and empowering the rural poor.
Kalam served as India’s leader between 2002 and 2007, and was popularly known as the “People’s President” and the “Missile Man” because he sought to support technological innovation in order to advance India’s weapons technology.
“The community is grateful that Dr. Kalam agreed to address us in his capacity as a leader of India with a scientific and modernist vision and as a motivator of today’s youth,” wrote Harvard Business School professor Tarun Khanna, the Director of the South Asia Initiative, in an emailed statement.
Khanna went on to say that under Kalam, India developed technical expertise in several areas, including engineering and health care treatments for the poor.
Kalam will address Harvard students in three separate talks during his time on campus.
On Tuesday, he will give the Harish C. Mahindra lecture, an annual speech sponsored by the South Asia Initiative in honor of the late Harish C. Mahindra ’46, who worked to shape India’s economic development as the founding chairman of Mahindra Ugine Steel Company.
In Kalam’s talk, entitled “Empowering Three Billion,” the former president will discuss his plans to empower the half of the world’s population currently living in rural areas, according to Amy K. Reese, the program outreach officer of SAI.
The following day, Kalam will give an additional two talks. The first will take place at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and will focus on the role of energy technology and nuclear power in India’s development.
The second talk, later that evening, will take place at Harvard Law School and will center on youth leadership and  engagement.
Reese wrote in an email that she is excited that students will be able to learn from Kalam’s insights about global development.
“SAI is hoping that students are inspired by Dr. Kalam’s ‘Vision for India 2020,’” Reese wrote, referring to the title of Kalam’s recent book, which focused on how India can become a developed nation by the year 2020.
“Known in India and globally for his passionate pursuit of education for all, this is a message that we are hoping resonates with Harvard’s students and community,” she wrote.

In past years, Harvard students looking to make quick money looked to coupons and research studies in need of subjects. But this year, students have another option for easy cash flow: school spirit.
Students who attend select Harvard sporting events can earn one dollar of Crimson Cash per game through the newly established Student Rewards Program. Participants can only earn a maximum yearly salary of approximately $30, but the marketing strategy represents a new initiative to draw students to games by paying them.
The program combines the marketing efforts of the Athletics Department and the Undergraduate Council to raise student attendance.
It will continue Friday night at the football team’s first night game of the season, which is consistently one of the best attended Harvard sporting events of the year. The Athletics Department is expecting slightly fewer than 3,000 students to attend the game, but the marketing office expects the night to be a major publicity push for the newly-conceived program.
Friday’s football game is the second sporting event of the year to be sponsored. The program launched at the men’s soccer game against Northeastern on Sept. 4 as part of the second annual “Fall Fiesta.”
Despite the initiative to increase student attendance, overall attendance decreased from 3,221 at last year’s Fall Fiesta to a total of 2,504 this year. Approximately 600 students swiped in this year.
Numbers likely fell because this year’s Sunday night time slot was less appealing to community fans than last year’s Saturday night time slot, Marketing Manager Taylor Shea said.
But she said she hopes the marketing campaign at some of the more popular events will create more attention for the rewards program and upcoming games.
“For an event that’s a really big deal, that’s a great opportunity to market the program or these other games that aren’t as popular,” said former marketing intern Emma M. Golen ’13, who initiated the program with Shea as part of her summer internship with the Athletics Department.
The Athletics Department chose to sponsor nine games this fall, and Shea hopes to sponsor a total of 30 games throughout the year.
These designated games will replace the traditional UC Game of the Week that the UC would advertise to the student body.
Instead, both the UC’s Student Relations Committee and the Athletics Department will focus on promoting and publicizing the same games.
“We thought this was the best way to increase school spirit and get students to games,” chair of the Student Relations Committee Daniel P. Bicknell ’13 said.
The marketing division of the Athletics Department will have “swipe tents” installed outside the stadium, likely next to the student section, where students can swipe their ID’s until the second half of the game.
“We’re encouraging everybody to get there early to swipe in and support [the football team],” Shea said.
The Crimson Cash giveaway is only one portion of the broader Student Rewards program. With every swipe, students will be automatically entered into a lottery for a larger grand prize to be rewarded at the end of each season.
“It’s great to have these raffles, but with these Crimson Cash pieces, everyone really gets a piece of the action,” Shea said.
She said she expects turnout to rise with as the program matures.
“Now, we’ve spent two or three weeks marketing it. Coming into our second game, I think it will catch fire.”

“Dean, Montgomerey, Alabama, 2010,” reads the caption on the side of the photograph. The man in the picture wears a green camouflage uniform and sits on a motel bed hugging his knees to his chest. He bows his head so the camera does not capture his face.
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” Jeff T. Sheng’s ’02 most recent photographic project, shot in 2009 and 2010, features gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender service members. Sheng said he could not show the faces of the people he photographed or any features that would reveal the identity of his subjects since the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy—which was officially repealed on Tuesday—did not allow them to disclose their sexual orientation.
“If their face was in it, they would get kicked out of the military,” Sheng said.
Thursday night, Visiting Lecturer on Visual and Environmental Studies Sheng presented some of his photographs at an exhibition in the Carpenter Center.
The photographs have attracted attention both in and outside the art world, including a mention during Congressional debates in March over whether “Dont Ask, Don’t Tell,” the law that forbade gays, lesbians, and bisexuals from openly serving in the military, should be repealed.
Last year, after Sheng published the first book of his “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” photographs and while working on a second he met with the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. They told him that they wanted to show images of service members affected by the military’s policy.
“I got insider information,” Sheng says. “They told me: there is a 50:50 shot that Obama is going to repeal ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’ If you could get this published, it would ease the process,” he said.
The second book of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” photographs was published two days before President Obama’s State of the Union Address in which he announced his plan to repeal the law.
“[My work] feels so historic all of a sudden,” he added, referring to the law’s recent repeal.
The idea for the books came from service members themselves.
After completing a series of photographs called “Fearless” in which Sheng took pictures of openly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender athletes, Sheng says service members—many of them former athletes—contacted him asking him to do a series on “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
“I felt really compelled,” Sheng said. “The service members just really wanted me to do something. It’s hard to say no when someone who is fighting for your country asks you to do something like this.”
Sheng says the next part of the series will focus on service members showing their faces as they can now serve openly.

Police are alerting Boston-area residents, especially college students new to the area, to a series of attacks along the Charles River between 2007 and 2009 and the man police say is behind them.
The Massachusetts State Police held a press conference on Wednesday at the Hatch Shell on the Esplanade, the area along the Charles, to encourage people to stay vigilant.
Police released a computer-assisted rendering of the suspect behind a string of assaults against young women. Authorities said the victims described him as a black man of medium to large build in his mid-20s to mid-30s.
“We do not yet know who attacked these women, but we will pledge to you today to never stop in our efforts,” State Police Col. Marian J. McGovern said at the press conference, according to video posted online. “All we ask is that you be careful.”
On Thursday afternoon, the Harvard University Police Department issued a community advisory to alert students, especially freshmen, to the attacks.
Authorities believe the suspect is responsible for three attacks on the Esplanade in June 2007, July 2007, and July 2009. He may also be linked to an attack at Joe Moakley Park in July 2006.
“We don’t want you to panic, and we don’t want you to live in fear,’” said Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley at the press conference, according to online video. “We want you to enjoy this beautiful city, but we want you to do it safely and keep an eye out for your friends and fellow citizens.”
The police have added extra patrols, and both the Massachusetts State Police and Boston Police urge students, especially new students in the area, to practice extra precaution while walking or running along the Charles and in the city after nightfall.

At this year’s iteration of The Game, Harvard students who have come to look forward to laxer tailgating regulations in New Haven will have to adjust to the reality of new rules put in place by Yale that seek to crack down on underage drinking.
Now, before they can be served alcohol, tailgate attendees will be required to show IDs and wear wristbands attesting to their legal drinking age. Additionally, tailgates will have to be registered ahead of time with the Yale Athletics Department. The new regulations also prohibit glass bottles and charcoal grills.
But the rules are still more lax than those at Harvard. Kegs will still be allowed, as well as hard alcohol. The tailgate can also extend to halftime; at Harvard, tailgates end at kickoff.
This year’s Harvard-Yale football game will take place on Nov. 19 and is the 128th edition of The Game.
The new rules, which will be in place for every game played in the Yale Bowl this fall, were decided by a committee of representatives from the residential colleges, the Yale Athletics Department, the Yale Police Department, and the Yale Office of Student Affairs. The committee typically reviews tailgate rules twice a year.
Committee head and Associate Athletic Director Natalie A. Gonzalez said that this year’s changes are the largest in recent memory.
According to Gonzalez, the committee focused on bringing the athletic tailgating rules “in line” with policies already in place for regular events held on the Yale campus, particularly the requirement that students register tailgates in advance.
“It wasn’t to cut back on fun at all,” Gonzalez said. “We just want to be more responsible.”
The changes, Gonzalez added, were not prompted by a specific incident involving alcohol but were rather part of an effort to be “proactive” about safety at tailgates. In making these changes, the committee looked at the policies of other schools around the country, including the rules in place when The Game was held in Boston last year.
The new Yale tailgate regulations follow nearly 10 years of increasing restrictions on tailgates in Boston. The differences in how tailgates are regulated at Harvard and at Yale have largely been attributed to the policies of the two cities, Boston and New Haven.
At the Harvard-hosted Game in 2002, then-Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 banned kegs, citing the hospitalization of four students in 2000. While the restrictions have been varied in the years since this decision, for the last two games held in Boston, kegs and hard alcohol have been forbidden.
Chairs of many House Committees, which each host tailgates at The Game, said that they do not expect these new regulations to significantly alter their own plans or Harvard students’ enjoyment of the tailgates, especially given the continuation of the more lenient keg policy and longer tailgating hours.
Lowell HoCo chair Michael K. Oberst ’12 said that after running the Lowell tailgate at Harvard last year, he does not think that the wristband requirement will create any major problems.
“The tailgates at Yale tend to be a lot more open. There’s often a perception that Yale tailgates are more fun,” Oberst said. “The impact shouldn’t be too bad.”

An aspiring educator, a passionate chef, and a genuine companion, Kolajo P. Afolabi will be remembered by his friends and family as a rising academic with a contagious smile.
Afolabi, a fifth year doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, died Wednesday morning after suffering an apparent head injury while on a morning run. He was 31.
A native of western Massachusetts, Afolabi grew up with humble beginnings.
His teachers cultivated his thirst for knowledge through grade school, and Afolabi was then accepted to Brown University, becoming the first in his family to attend an Ivy League college.
At Brown, Afolabi was hard to miss, said his best friend Annie K. Steele. Towering at 6 ft., 3 in., and bringing his charismatic flair wherever he went, Afolabi was in more ways than one “larger than life.”
It would be at Brown where Afolabi began to pursue his interest in helping students from low-income families gain access to a college education.
“He was a hard worker,” Steele said. “He was competent, but he recognized that it’d taken a lot of hard work to get him where he was.”
It soon became Afolabi’s dream to become an educator at a higher level institution.
In the fall of 2007, Afolabi started working toward his doctorate at the Ed School under the advising of Ed School professor Bridget T. Long.
“He had a strong commitment to improving the lives of students, particularly those who are traditionally disadvantaged,” Long said.
During his first four years in the program, Afolabi became editor of the Harvard Education Review and served on a three-person committee that advised current faculty members during a search to hire new faculty members fluent in the area of quantitative policy analysis in education.
Afolabi was also a teaching fellow for Ed School courses during that time.
Outside of his academic life, Afolabi was a fast runner.
He ran a 5-kilometer race in 18 minutes last weekend, said his partner Bobby J. van Druff.
Van Druff and Afolabi had just bought  an old house together in Providence where they lived with their two dogs Lou and Albey. They’d begun renovating their home, room by room, tearing down wallpaper, painting the walls, and putting in new tiles.
Van Druff said he would remember Afolabi practicing his lectures by playing his presentation slides on the living room television.
In the evenings, Afolabi would curl up to a few episodes of NBC’s “30 Rock” every now and then.
“He wasn’t just my partner,” van Druff said. “He was my best friend.”
The two would make gourmet dinners, homemade ice cream, and pastries from scratch. Kathleen Afolabi, his mother, said that her son was particularly talented with rolling dough. She remembers his popovers, biscuits, and cinnamon rolls.
Steele remembers Afolabi’s sweet potato gnocchi, and van Druff remembers that Afolabi would keep logs of homemade cookie dough frozen and slice a few for freshly baked cookies.
Of course, he was always humble about his cooking ability, just as he was with all his other accomplishments.
Afolabi was recently appointed adjunct lecturer at Brown, where he was teaching two classes this fall while continuing work on his doctorate at the Harvard Ed School. This had been his dream, van Druff said, getting the opportunity to be a lecturer and teaching his own class.
He was only a few weeks in when he died.
“He’s 31 years old,” Kathleen Afolabi said. “He’s got so much to live for, so much to contribute to life. He’s not going to have an opportunity to do that.”
Flipping through the family photos of her son when he was a kid, she focused on those memories that would remain with her—his hazel eyes and the close-up shot of his long, dark eyelashes. And then there was his unforgettable smile.
“He really just had this kind of brightness, this high energy about him,” Long said. “He was a character—this really warm, bright person with a really great laugh ... He was just a bright light.”
In addition to his mother, he is survived by his father Kolajo, sister Yea, brother Dele, and his partner, van Druff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard-educated biology professor Amy Bishop, accused of murdering three colleagues at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, pleaded not-guilty by reason of mental disease or defect on Thursday.
Bishop allegedly shot six people, killing three, at a faculty meeting in February 2010 after the university refused to grant her tenure. She faces charges of capital and attempted murder, and the prosecution is seeking the death penalty.
After entering her plea, Bishop was taken back to the Madison County Jail, where she will stay until her court date on March 19.
Bishop had also been indicted in the killing of her brother in 1984. Bishop, then 19 years old, shot her brother three times before attempting to escape in a stolen car.
After her involvement in the February shooting, authorities reopened the case of her brother’s death.
Bishop had originally told the police that she accidentally shot him, a claim upheld in the original investigation. The more recent investigation revealed no new information.
In 1993, police also linked Bishop to the attempted bombing of a Harvard medical professor. Although never charged, Bishop and her husband were questioned by authorities investigating the delivery of a package containing two unexploded pipe bombs to Paul A. Rosenberg, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.
Bishop received a PhD from Harvard that year.
Despite her ties to past criminal investigations, Robert L. Broussard, district attorney for Madison County, Alabama, said evidence from those investigations will not be submitted in the trial. But Bishop’s prior crimes may surface in discussions about her emotional and mental competency at the time of the shooting.
Now, Bishop faces the “burden of proving that she was insane at the time”, Broussard said.
Because the judge has imposed a gag-order on case details, Broussard declined to comment on the prosecution’s strategy moving forward with the case. Roy W. Miller, Bishop’s attorney, was not available to comment.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: SEPTEMBER 25, 2011
The Sept. 23 story "Harvard Ph.D. Amy Bishop Appears in Court for Allegedly Murdering Colleagues" incorrectly identified the original investigation into the death of Bishop's brother as a trial. The case was ruled an accident.

Harvard researchers have provided some of the most conclusive analysis to date indicating that depression can increase the risk of stroke.
Compiling data from 28 past studies involving more than 317,000 participants, researchers found that depression is associated with a 45 percent increase in the risk of stroke and a 55 percent increase in the risk of dying from a stroke.
“In previous literature, there was no conclusive evidence that depression could increase the risk of stroke,” said An Pan, lead author of the analysis and a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health.
The report was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Past studies have suggested an association between depression and the risk of stroke, but the results have not been consistent.
Pan’s team conducted a systematic review and analysis of the previous work.
“We thought that this study would be important for the community because depression is very common, and strokes are a leading cause of disability and death in this country,” Pan said.
In an earlier study, Pan found that antidepressant medication may be one factor to consider in the increased risk of stroke.
“There are a lot of inconsistencies and controversy regarding antidepressant medication,” he said. “Whether this medication has side effects that increase the risk of heart disease and stroke is unknown.”
Kathryn M. Rexrode, co-author of the analysis and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, cautioned against ending medical treatment for depression out of concern that drugs may increase the risk of stroke. She recommended a holistic approach to treating depression.
“Physicians should be sure that they help depressed patients engage in healthy lifestyles, comply with medications, and get other cardiovascular risk factors under control—such as smoking, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes,” Rexrode said.
Pan said he hopes that depression will be included as a risk for stroke in the medical community so that patients with depression will be aware of the possible risks and monitor their symptoms accordingly.
He said that depressed individuals should also consider that behavior associated with depression, such as smoking and drinking, are also factors that increase the risk of stroke.
According to Pan, smoking increases the risk of stroke by 50 percent.
The researchers believe that future trials are necessary to determine treatments, if they exist, for helping depressed individuals reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Friday home opener against Brown is one of two main Ivy attractions in the next few days. Last year, the Bears took the Ancient Eight opener against the Crimson, 29-14, on their home field. This year, Harvard does not want to repeat last season’s less-than-stellar start. As of now, the Crimson has never lost a night game at home. They hope to continue this streak on Friday.
Here's who to look out for during this week’s contests:
Brown: The Bears’ senior quarterback, Kyle Newhall-Caballaro, proved that individuals could make a comeback. After missing most of last season due to injury, Newhall-Caballero had an impressive return outing last week, as he went 22-37 for a total of 292 yards as well as three touchdowns. If his success continues this week agaisnt the Crimson, Brown’s season will definitely be on the rise.
Harvard: If the Crimson wants to handle the Bears, senior quarterback Collier Winters must have a big impact on the game. Against Holy Cross, Winters passed for 265 yards and two touchdowns, but deuces were wild and he also had two interceptions. This summer, Winters won the “Air it Out” competition at Peyton Manning’s Passing Academy, beating both collegiate and professional athletes. He is going to need to repeat that accuracy this weekend and connect with teammates in order to beat Newhall-Cabellaro head-to-head.
The other Ivy matchup of the weekend is Cornell at Yale. Both teams are coming off wins last week and both squads have something to prove heading into the season. After a 1-6 season last year, the Big Red needs a massive upset to boost their morale. This game could provide just that boost if they were to win (believe me, they will have all of Harvard pulling for them). The Bulldogs, on the other hand, need to stay consistent and beat the “easier” teams in the Ivy in order to keep level with their main competition: Harvard and Penn. As both teams gave up over 300 yards last weekend, look for this game to be battled on the offensive end. Yale is favored to win this game easily.
Who to look our for (Quarterback Edition, Part II):
Cornell: As mentioned earlier, long distance completions were vital for the Big Red in its game against Bucknell. Sophomore Jeff Mathews was behind those long throws, connecting on 15-28 passses, including two touchdowns. Against Yale though, he may need to gain even more consistency.
Yale: The Bulldogs have, perhaps, the strongest quarterback in the league in senior Patrick Witt. Already, Witt is on good pace to break every passing record that former Yalies have held—he is the only quarterback in school history to complete greater than 60% of his passes. Due to his success last weekend, he is now third all time for the Bulldogs in completions and sixth in touchdown passes (three of which he threw last Saturday).
This weekend will definitely decide a thing or two among the Ivies. The thousands of fans that are expected to attend Friday night’s game should look up to the sky for the action. And after last weekend’s game against Holy Cross, let’s face it, up is the only way to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a loss last week against Holy Cross, Harvard football looks to even its record under the lights.
The Crimson (0-1) plays its home opener tonight at 7 p.m. against Brown (1-0) in the first Ivy contest for both teams. But Harvard may have to do it without senior quarterback Collier Winters.
Winters appeared to suffer a minor hamstring injury towards the end of last week’s game, and whether he plays will be a game-time decision.
Junior Colton Chapple, the team’s second-string quarterback, has been taking snaps in practice all week and would start if Winters does not.
Though Brown won last year’s game in Providence, recent history favors Harvard against the Bears, as the Crimson has won six of the last eight meetings between the two squads.
Harvard will have to maintain consistency throughout the game—something it failed to do last week in its 30-22 loss. Brown came into the season as a dark-horse Ivy League favorite, and the team has gained ground in recent years, splitting second place with Harvard and Yale last season.
But Winters feels confident in the team’s ability to rebound from its recent disappointment.
“The Holy Cross loss was really tough,” Winters said. “I feel like when we came into that game, we were pretty confident we would come out with the victory. But one thing I’ve seen being at Harvard the last four or so years ... is that after a loss, we’ll come back next week and play at a very high level ... Two years ago, we lost to Holy Cross and came back and won this same game against Brown.”
Harvard football’s history of resurgence stretches beyond its rebound in 2009.
Since 2007, the Crimson has not lost two games in a row, and recorded a victory in eight consecutive games after a loss.
“Brown’s a good opponent,” said captain middle linebacker Alex Gedeon. “To win, we’ve got to play to our abilities ... play a physical game and make fewer errors.”
Fixing those errors—like allowing a 97-yard interception return for a touchdown or fumbling a punt in last week’s loss—is a critical step coming into tonight’s game. Several breakdowns in field coverage helped the Crusaders take the game away, by scoring 27 straight points last weekend.
“We need to limit the mistakes we’re killing ourselves with,” said junior running back Treavor Scales. “We gave that game to them ... offensively, ball security is something that’s echoed throughout the entire offensive unit.”
The team understands that Brown is an offensive threat. This year, the Bears started of their season last weekend with a tight opening win over Stony Brook, 21-20.
Brown quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero returned from an injury that lasted the better part of the 2010-2011 season, throwing for three touchdowns and 292 total yards to secure a win for the Bears in that contest.
The Crimson has spent this week refining fundamentals that proved costly last week and analyzing Brown’s game, both offensively and defensively.
But the recent loss has not weakened the team’s spirit, and the Crimson looks to come into tonight’s contest against the Bears with heightened confidence in both offensive and defensive lines.
“Getting the running game going is obviously always a primary [concern],” Scales said. “But we’ve got to make sure to have a balanced attack ... so [we’re] just making sure we’re maintaining that balance—firing on all cylinders offensively would be a very helpful thing for us.”
If Winters is injured and doesn’t start tonight’s game, Harvard will have to rely more on Scales and its running attack.
The squad is perfect under the lights at Harvard Stadium, winning every night home game since the lights were first installed in 2007.
Harvard also had success at home last season, boasting a 4-1 record in 2010, and the Crimson looks to continue its success on its own turf in order  to push its season in a new direction and get into the win column.
Based on Brown’s performance last weekend, it will be a tough but manageable contest for Harvard.
“We’re definitely making adjustments, but the adjustments are just about doing a better job with our assignments, our fundamentals, and our techniques,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “If you don’t improve those, specific scheme adjustments aren’t going to matter.”
Many of the schemes rely on Winters, and  although the starting quarterback’s status is day-to-day, he still hopes to make it into tonight’s game.
“It’s definitely a big game, so I’m going to try and do everything I can to play in it,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been an inconsistent start to the year for the Harvard men’s soccer team, which dropped a heartbreaking match to Vermont on a late-game header last Sunday, giving the squad its third loss of the year.
But despite a few early season slip-ups, the Crimson (2-3) has plenty of reason to like its chances moving forward, thanks in part to the play of an emerging freshmen class.
Midfielder Tim Schmoll, forward Michael Inoccenzi, and forward Hiroki Kobayashi have stepped into key roles in the team’s rotation during their rookie campaigns. All have seen significant game action thus far—Innoccenzi has seen time in all five games, while Schmoll and Kobayashi have each played in four and registered three starts between the two of them.
“I didn’t really expect to play just because I was a freshman,” said Schmoll. “But now that I have experience on the field, I feel really comfortable.”
This rising comfort level has been evident amongst all three freshmen. Schmoll assisted on Harvard’s lone goal against the University of Rhode Island and has had a solid presence in the midfield.
“[Schmoll] always influences the game one way or the other, with his pure physical presence and his ability to win a lot of headers,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said.
Inoccenzi is becoming a focal point of the Harvard offense after drawing two penalty kicks against UMass last week, the second of which resulted in an overtime victory for the squad. Kobayashi’s speed up front has also made him an ever-present threat.
The entire Crimson squad is trying to reverse a trend in which the team has only put home three goals in five games. But one may need to look no farther than the freshmen—who have been directly involved in two-thirds of the club’s scoring to this point—for some help.
The trio’s smooth adjustment to the fast-paced play of Division I soccer is all the more impressive considering how they got here. Schmoll, who grew up in Geneva, Switzerland, but whose parents are both American, has had to adjust to living on the other side of the Atlantic, while juggling a busy schedule of classes and soccer practices.
“There were a ton of nerves in the beginning,” Schmoll said about the transition. “I had no experience of what it would be like over here.”
Schmoll, who played in Switzerland’s National Academies League at the U18 level, saw Harvard as a natural fit.
“I always wanted to come to college here,” he said. “I just never thought I would actually be able to do it.”
Schmoll attended the same high school in Switzerland as Kwaku Nvamekye ’10, a former Crimson standout who was able to make an initial connection and get the ball rolling on the freshman’s recruitment.
Kobayashi was equally excited about his chance to come play for the Crimson.
“Harvard was always my first choice,” he explained. “But the first time I got an email from them, I thought, ‘There’s no way I could actually go there.’”
Born in Japan, Kobayashi moved to upstate New York at age 14 and went on to have a stellar high school and club career for FC Westchester, catching the attention of coaches nationwide, including Junot.
Along with Innocenzi, who had a similarly strong club career and success on the national level,  Kobayashi and Schmoll have faced some challenges in moving to the college game and transitioning to college life.
Kobayashi noted the rapid speed of the college game, as well as the raw strength of all the players.
“It feels like everybody’s bigger than me,” he said.
At 6’6”, Schmoll may not be able to empathize with such complaints, but he was surprised by how true Harvard’s scholarly reputation has held.
“The workload’s a lot harder than I thought,” he admitted. “I don’t really get much time to relax.”
But overall, it seems the transition to life at Harvard has been painless, largely thanks to a supportive group of coaches and teammates.
“It’s been great to have the upperclassmen as a source for advice on classes, scheduling, and everything else,” Kobayashi said.
“Everybody’s been really helpful and accommodating,” Schmoll agreed.
For their part, the freshmen plan to continue working hard in practice and solidify their roles as key contributors. Above all, they hope to reverse the recent fortunes of a team with high preseason expectations.
“We’re individually doing well in terms of getting playing time,” Kobayashi said. “But that’s not what it’s about. I play to win the game.”
The Crimson will be looking to get back on track Friday night in a decisive matchup at Stanford, where Junot will be looking for a strong performance from this freshmen rotation.
“All in all, I am happy with all of them,” Junot said. “They continue to contribute, and we feel confident putting them on the field.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to avenge a pair of heartbreaking losses, Harvard women’s soccer (3-4) opens Ivy League play with a primetime matchup against the defending league champions, the University of Pennsylvania  (5-1), at Soldiers Field tonight.
This will mark the fourth consecutive time the teams will have met to open their respective Ivy campaigns and the 20th time they have met since the Ivy League women’s soccer program gained varsity status in 1991. The Crimson has dominated the series, posting a record of 13-4-3.
At face value, these two teams appear to be headed in opposite directions entering the crucial part of the season. Harvard is riding a three-game losing streak, which includes nail-biters against the University of Rhode Island and Hofstra University. Meanwhile, the Quakers have won five of its last six matches. Fortunately, Crimson freshman midfielder Lauren Urke and her teammates say they have a short memory.
“We learn from our mistakes, take lessons, and move forward from there,” Urke said, emphasizing how the has team “clicked” on and off the field.
Harvard coach Ray Leone plans to use this game as a gauge of his team’s progress.
“We are still growing as a team, and starting the Ivy League season this week should give us an idea of where we are in many areas,” he said. “[Penn] is a very good team … We will have to play very well to be successful.”
It should be an entertaining contest if recent series history is any indication. The previous three matchups—which averaged five goals and a one-goal margin of victory per game­—have featured plenty of scoring and drama.
To add yet another dimension to tonight’s game, the Crimson has a chance to avenge more than its recent heartbreakers. Penn recaptured the Ivy League title from the Crimson last year, taking its second championship in the last four years, while Harvard claims the other two. A big performance tonight would send a message to the rest of the Ivy League that the Crimson means business.
In addition, both the Quakers and the Crimson have fresh faces that could make an impact. Penn is starting four new players this season after losing All-Ivy recipients Kaitlin Campbell and Sarah Friedman to graduation. Freshman midfielder Katilyn Moore has recently received praise for her performance.
Yet Harvard also has youth to help bolster its roster. Leone has already incorporated all 11 freshmen into his system, giving each playing time. Among the impact rookies are Meg Casscells-Hamby, who has scored two goals and notched three assists, Kate Makaroff, who has scored two goals, and Urke, who has a goal and two assists. Freshmen Bethany Kanten and Cheta Emba have also played a combined 311 minutes in goal, allowing only five scores.
This season Harvard and Penn are among the top three in the Ivy League in shots, points, and goals per game, although the Crimson ranks first in both shots and goals.
After a five-day layoff, Harvard should enter tonight’s match revitalized physically and strategically.
“We are really excited for [tonight’s] game … We’ve played a lot of games in a short period of time, which is good because we’ve been able to play a bunch of different people,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “Now it’s back to the drawing board to see what works and put it all together [tonight].”
Penn has decimated opponents in its previous six games, outscoring them 11-3.  During this streak, it outshot opponents 46 to 24 and had 44 corner kicks compared to their opponents’ 11. All five of the Quakers’ wins during this span were shutouts.
Senior forward Marin McDermott has led the way. She has scored four goals —good for first in the Ivy League—and has tallied an assist thus far. Her start this season is indicative of her play throughout her career; she has received honorable mention for the All-Ivy team each of the past three years.
This group of women has never played a home Ivy League contest under the big lights.
“It’s exciting,” Baskind said. “We usually play them at night at their place … We should definitely get some more fans and it should add some intensity to the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the most intriguing story lines of Friday’s football game against Brown has nothing to do with football.
For the fifth year in a row, men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker will welcome a number of highly-touted high schoolers to campus during the weekend of the football team’s home opener in an effort to persuade them to select Harvard and turn down offers from major schools in the process.
The former Michigan and Seton Hall coach will have his hands fuller than ever on Friday, as he hosts eight prospects from the high school classes of 2012 and 2013—six of whom are currently in the MaxPreps.com Top 100 rankings for their year.
Amaker has employed the football night game tactic recently with varying success. Neither of the two top targets that visited two years ago is currently on the Harvard roster, but exactly one year ago, current freshman Kenyatta Smith committed to joining the Crimson during his official visit.
But this time around, Amaker’s recruiting targets have set him apart from not only his peers in the Ivy League, but also his own track record.
“An Ivy League school staying in the mix with these guys is shocking,” Jeff Borzello, a college basketball writer at CBSSports.com, said. “There’s been high-major head coaches at mid-major schools before, and it doesn’t work like this. I think it’s really impressive.”
CLASS OF 2016?
The star-studded list of visitors begins with Harvard-Westlake School (Calif.) senior Zena Edosomwan, one of the premier big men on the West Coast.
“Very much a kid who plays hard in the lane, a finisher,” ESPN analyst Dave Telep said. “Kind of a blue-collar guy that has really erupted in the last year or so. A back-end top-100 player, just a very trustworthy power forward.”
The 6’8”, 230-lb Edosomwan, who carries a 3.0 GPA and will be taking the SAT next month, is considering a final list of five schools: the University of Southern California, University of Washington, UC Berkeley, University of Texas, and Harvard. He will decide in November after completing his official visits.
“[Assistant coach Yanni] Hufnagel is someone I really respect, and I met Coach Amaker some time during the spring,” said Edosomwan, who is ranked the No. 12 power forward in the nation by Scout.com. “They’ve recruited me very hard. I really understand and see where they’re trying to take this program.”
Fellow front-court presence Mike Hall, standing at 6’10”, 195 pounds, will be making his way to campus as well.
The Rivals.com three-star prospect is coming off of a trip to UPenn last weekend and has also made an official visit at George Mason. He said recently that Harvard rounds out his top three schools but that he also has offers from Northwestern and Memphis. A senior at Woodward Academy (Ga.), he has a 3.4 GPA and plans to retake the SAT soon.
“Hall is a long-term stock as a four- or a five-man,” Telep said. “Length and ability to change ends and run the floor are two of his calling cards. The next step for him is going from prospect to player.”
“In the Ivy League, he could dominate,” Borzello added. “By his junior year, people could be saying, ‘How did he get to Harvard?’”
Completing the trio of 2012 attendees is Siyani Chambers, a Hopkins High (Minn.) senior given three stars by both Rivals.com and Scout.com.
A friend of current Harvard freshman Jonah Travis, the 5’11”, 160-lb point guard said his top two choices are Harvard—which he said began recruiting him in eighth grade—and UC Davis, to which he has a trip scheduled. He is also speaking with UC Santa Barbara and Loyola Marymount.
“I think he’s a really solid point guard and he would be a good fit for Harvard,” said Borzello of Chambers, who possesses a 3.7 GPA and recently retook the ACT for the third time. “He could run the show for four years.”
THE BIG SHOTS OF 2017
Perhaps even more eye-opening is the fivesome of high school juniors also exploring Cambridge this weekend. Amaker and his staff are welcoming an impressive array of high school talent; all are consensus top-100 players, and several of them are among the best 50 in the country.
In short, they are unlike anything Harvard has ever seen before.
Because they are not seniors, the five are embarking upon self-financed unofficial visits.
“They could be going to Louisville, they could be going to Georgetown, and they’re paying their way out to Harvard,” Borzello said. “I think that shows something.”
“I would almost guarantee that 2013 group is unparalleled in terms of any campus [hosting players this weekend],” Borzello added.
The headline act of the show is likely 6’7”, 190-lb Brannen Greene, who along with his 4.0 GPA, boasts offers from Florida, Florida State, Georgia Tech, UConn, Louisville, and Kansas, among others.
Given a 97 by ESPN and ranked No. 16 in the U.S. by CBS, Greene visited Florida State last weekend and UConn yesterday. He’ll also be heading to Kansas for its Midnight Madness event.
“I love Coach Amaker, and I love Coach Hufnagel,” Greene said. “I’m looking forward to seeing what it’s like up there and taking it from there.”
“His stroke is fantastic, really deep range,” said Borzello of the Mary Persons High (Ga.) junior. “I think that would be an unbelievable get for Harvard.”
Greene said he will make a short list around November and a decision the month after.
Greene will be meeting up with his friend Stephen Domingo of St. Ignatius High (Calif.) in Cambridge. A 6’7”, 195-lb wing player with a 3.4 GPA, Domingo has visited Georgetown and UC Berkeley and plans to visit Arizona and Washington as well.
“The schools that are getting visits, I really want to see what they have to offer. There’s something about those schools,” said Domingo, dubbed the 28th-best player in the nation by ESPN and called one of the best prospects on the West Coast by Telep.
MORE TEAMMATES, MORE FRIENDS
Converging in Cambridge will be another a pair of AAU teammates, Davon Reed and Austin Colbert.
Reed, a consensus four-star guard standing at 6’5” and 190 pounds with a 6’10 wingspan, holds offers from Boston College, St. Joseph’s, Temple, and Xavier (among others) and will be visiting Virginia Commonwealth next weekend.
“The way he and Austin [Colbert] carry themselves—it’s rare today, especially rare for elite athletes, to be that humble, that well-spoken, and that level-headed,” said Paris McLean, Reed’s coach at Princeton Day School (N.J.).
“He’s a really good scorer, he can shoot the ball, can get to the rim well,” Borzello said. “I think he’s a top-50 guy in the class.”
According to Fred Benjamin, his coach at the Hotchkiss School (Conn.), the majority of Big East schools are showing interest in junior Austin Colbert, including North Carolina, Louisville, Villanova, and Xavier.
“Another four-man who has a tremendous amount of natural ability,” Telep said of Colbert, Scout’s No. 7 power forward in the country. “He is a face-up ‘4’ who can give you something on the defensive end as well.”
The final visitor will be 6’7, 215-lb Alex Foster, rated four stars and No. 82 in his class by MaxPreps.com.
Foster has visited Valparaiso and Tennessee—which he said are his only offers so far—and is interested in Wake Forest, DePaul, and Notre Dame.
“Me and [Coach Hufnagel] have been tight ever since [we met],” Foster said. “He calls me his ‘little brother.’ Me and Coach Amaker, we’ve only talked once, but I’m sure he’s a pretty cool guy just like Yanni is.”
“Butler’s heavy on him,” Borzello said of the De La Salle Institute (Ill.) junior. “He runs the floor well.”
It’s hard to imagine that the weekend could have had an additional blue-chipper. Junior guard Nigel Williams-Goss of Findlay Prep (Ariz.), rated 40th in the country by Rivals.com, said he would have liked to visit but could not, due to his school’s travel schedule.
‘A VERY, VERY BIG DEAL’
Regardless, the significance of this weekend for Harvard basketball cannot be understated.
“To score a single commitment from that package of players would be a very, very big deal for Harvard,” Telep said.
And it’s also a big deal for Amaker, who was tempted by a job offer from the University of Miami in April but chose to stay in Cambridge.
Add the fact that the league presidents voted this summer to raise the minimum Academic Index required for prospective athletes to enroll in an Ivy program, and it’s possible that if none of these high school students commit to Harvard for the long haul, Amaker might not either.
And so, the Harvard coaching staff will do its best to make this opportunity count.
“It all comes down to one thing,” Telep said. “How many of those kids do you get?”

Listed below are 15 reasons why you should come to the Harvard vs. Brown football game tonight.
 
1. It's Brown. Harvard clearly needs to prove its Ivy dominance against the school that insists on having a Pass or Fail option for every class. 
 
2. Show off your Harvard apparel. We know you have it. You, with the Harvard sweatshirt, mini running shorts, blazer, sunglasses, and matching shirts for Mom and Dad. You never wear them in case they led to a conversation involving the H-Bomb. The time to wear this stuff is now. 
 
3. Undefeated. Harvard football has never lost a night home game. A pretty much tangible piece of evidence of our school's perfection. What could be better than being a part of that?
 
4. Emma Watson. Let's be real. Emma Watson was at the Harvard vs. Brown game last year. This year, we're aiming for the big leagues. No one knows which Hogwartian will show up next. 
 
5. The Red Sox can't put two wins in a row in the midst of an incredibly close wildcard race and the NBA currently doesn't exist. If you're into the world of sports the game tonight might be the best you're gonna get for a while.
 
6. Everyone knows that the Yale game is "The Game." But say that there was more than one game per season. Say that one more game could decide who won the Ivy League title. Say, in fact, that this game was tonight. Would you go?
 
7. Freshman Dropouts. Chances are if you want to be a computer mogul and follow in the steps of Zuckerberg, you're going to drop out soon. Just in case this happens before The Game, the (other) game tonight is a good opportunity to make sure you see at least one athletic event in your time here.
 
8. Lamont closes at 10 p.m. on Fridays. If you were planning on being there on a Friday night anyway, you need to get out and smell the Crimson-colored roses. There is no risk of stepping out of the library, we promise. 
 
9. Crimson Dance Team. It's the CDT's first time performing at a football game. Not only will we get to see a potential battle between this new team and Harvard Cheer, but we'll also be able to judge firsthand whether it actually earns the tag of a club sport. 
 
10. Crimson Cash giveaway. $1 for laundry, bitches!
 
11. The Bulldogs have their first Ivy League game this weekend and are pitted against Cornell. It would be embarrassing if we let them outshine us on week one. So we need to come out in numbers.
 
12. Facebook. You wake up, turn on your computer, and log on to Facebook. Your newsfeed is filled with pictures of friends at various other schools (i.e. Michigan, Wisconsin, Syracuse) showing spirit. They're screaming, decked out in face paint, and yelling for their teams. You want that. A little bit of you, deep inside, is regretting not having their experiences. Well guess what? Come and get it.
 
13. Senior quarterback Collier W. Winters' '12 hair. 
 
14. Parties. If you're in your dorm all night, you definitely won't hear all of what is going down. If you’re at the game, you're automatically with 18,000 of your closest friends. Think about it.
 
15. The actual football team. According to preseason rankings, Harvard football is listed second in the Ivy League. We even got some first place votes. If you’re actually interested in Harvard athletics and seeing a good game, come.

What were you doing last Friday at 1:39 a.m.? If you live in Pforzheimer House, you probably wish you'd been at your computer like Bonnie Cao '12, who was up late working on a paper.
Early Friday morning, Cao saw an email from Pfoho Tutor Andrey Liscovich with the subject line "outing to Sears tower – yes, the one in Chicago – Sat, Sept 24." Before she'd finished reading the unusual email, she responded expressing interest in the outing.  Cao, who is from Los Angeles and hasn't visited the Midwest, said she had been hoping to travel to Chicago and that this seemed like the perfect opportunity to do so.
"Andrey had been my floor tutor my sophomore year so I knew he was a trustworthy guy," she said. "He tends to be really good at these things."
Other students who received the email were more skeptical of this bizarre offer—a day-long "outing" to a city 1,000 miles away free of charge. Regardless, Liscovich estimated that he received 100 responses in the hours after he sent the initial email. After asking each student who'd written back to provide his or her full name and date of birth, Liscovich selected the first eight Pfohosers to do so as his traveling companions for this weekend's "outing."
"I guess I got really lucky by being an insomniac," Cao said. By around 4 a.m., all eight students had been notified that they'd be on the excursion, and their round-trip tickets to Chicago had been booked.
But how on earth is this trip free when most normal House outings—a day of apple-picking or a trip to the movies—require participating students to cover half the cost?
"It's just how you manage the budget," Liscovich said.
"It's very mysterious, to be honest," said Jinyan Zang '13, who will be on Saturday's trip.
Liscovich wants to keep it that way.  He declined to give specific costs, but did say that the trip would be covered by the $300 outing budget that each tutor gets each semester, and that admission to the Sears Tower—which costs $17 for adults—is going to cost more than the plane tickets themselves.
Lunch at the University of Chicago will be free. For his part, Liscovich says he is looking forward to "free lunch in a place that doesn't believe in free lunches."
