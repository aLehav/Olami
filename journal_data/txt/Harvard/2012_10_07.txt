After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Did we create Disneyland, and fill it with plushies to prove that we are not plushies?” asks actor Mikéah Ernest Jennings in one the more poignant moments of “World of Wires.” “Wires,” a play directed by Jay Scheib that ran at the ICA until September 22 and was based on Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s science fiction telefilm “Welt am Draht,” puts themes such as agency and creation in a whole new light. Despite depending on an overused sci-fi plot device—that our lives are just computer creations—“World of Wires” is a haunting satire of society’s over-dependence on technology. Through his unconventional direction, Scheib examines the inherent artificiality of theater—the idea that in many productions, playwrights, and actors want to convince the audience that a choreographed, scripted piece of art is in fact real life.
You might say that “World of Wires” is a Pinocchio story gone wrong: Fred Stiller (Jon Morris), the co-inventor of “Simulacrum–3” (a machine that is capable of transferring the consciousness of an individual to a wholly human-mediated fictional universe) comes to the understanding that he has actually been conceived to operate in such a system. Stiller then seeks out a way of leaving his own simulated world in order to become a “real person.” However, he realizes that he is in danger when he discovers that people who have had the same revelation as him—such as Simulacrum–3 co-inventor Professor Fuller (Winsome Brown) and the Head of Internal Security Ivana Ng Ivanova (Ayesha Ngaujah)—have been “deleted” by their anonymous Gepettos. As the plot unfolds, Scheib captures it on a hand-held camera, and the resulting footage is projected on screens surrounding the action on stage.
The performance begins with a huge white screen, namely “the fourth wall.” Usually, the fourth wall is a concept that is meant to explain the division between the stage and real life, but in ”World of Wires” this separation is physical. The screen blocks the audience’s view of the stage, and on it is projected the live-stream video of the action on the other side of the wall. The screen consists of a few dozen storage boxes regularly arranged on top of each other as well as an actual projection screen reaching to the same height. The image is projected on both. At one point, one of the boxes is knocked out of position and the actors are able to see the “real world” beyond the fourth wall. Consequently, several actors gaze at the audience through the hole, now well aware of the fact that there is a world outside of their fake, scripted existence. Minutes later, the fourth wall gets demolished by the cast.
After this clever pun on the nature of theater, the artificiality of whatever is transpiring in the production is exposed. From two overhead plasma screens, the audience may continue to watch the live-stream footage or the actors onstage. Two walls of mirrors flank the action on either side, so most of the time Scheib is in his own movie, endlessly multiplied on both mirrors allowing his reflection to be caught on camera. The show plays with this notion of the hollowness of theater. For example, bags of a red liquid substance are conspicuously spread by a hand over a shot body under the watchful eye of the camera.
In this oddly eclectic play, romance is replaced by impulsive sexuality and characters engage in lengthy debates on potato chips. As a result, “World of Wires” amounts to one big freak-show with an onstage “auteur.” In a nod to “The Matrix,” Tanya Selvaratnam ’93 warns us about the pervasiveness of the artistic invention that we call reality when she says, “I wouldn’t eat the blue one if I were you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 10, 2012, at 5:58 p.m.
In an effort to break the silence on an often-stigmatized topic, members of the Harvard community gathered to share experiences with mental illness through spoken word, interpretive dance, and candid conversations at Friday night’s second-annual “Words on the Mind” open mic night.
Presented by campus groups Contact, Response, Room 13, Speak Out Loud, and the Student Mental Health Liaisons, the event aimed to spark conversations on a broad range of mental health issues.
Through artistic expression, students addressed a wide variety of painful losses—that of a friend to suicide, of a mother’s sanity to bipolar disorder, of a grandfather to Alzheimer’s disease, of a daughter’s relationship with her father following her decision to come out of the closet.
“We’re going to be talking about what people are actually going through in terms of mental health and what that actually means,” emcee Keerthi Reddy ’14 said as she welcomed a full Ticknor Lounge. “We’re going to be talking about actual experiences.”
Capturing her mother’s struggle to escape a cage constructed by “the bars of genetics,” Amy C. Robinson ’15 presented her original work “Poem for My Mother.”
“She called us from the mental hospital, words slurred, thoughts blurred. She told us a story—not a story like fairy tales, not a story like when she lay next to me and whispered magical words into my ears and we both fell asleep dreaming, holding each other,” Robinson read as audience members snapped their fingers and nodded in support.
“I just want to show this to obliterate the stigma, disintegrate the enigma because she is the world. She is all religions, all beliefs. She is a caged tiger, trapped,” she said as the poem drew to a close.
Ben G. Blumstein ’15 performed an original poem that featured snapshots from childhood and ended with the image of “teeming clouds.”
His poem concluded, “I can see ’em still, I can see ’em. But am I going to be the westward flock chasing the spine of the sinking sun or the bird who will taste the eastern dark hopeful for our new one?”
Bex H. Kwan ’14, who played music between each speaker as the DJ for the event, chose to use body and movement to convey a message. After getting the audience to their feet, Kwan led the group in a harmonized singing of the line, “We are community together.” With the crowd clapping and singing as one, Kwan jumped around the stage in an energetic mix of stomp and interpretative dance.
Between recitations, representatives from peer counseling groups presented the services offered by their organizations. Some groups said that they would remain open later than usual that night for students inspired by the program to reach out for help.
One student, who said she had never performed a poem in public before, was moved to write a tribute to Cote K. Laramie ’14 during intermission and read it during the second half of the program. Laramie committed suicide earlier this semester at his home in New Hampshire.
Maura D. Church '14, one of the event’s organizers, emphasized the importance of eliminating the stigma associated with mental health problems.
“No one bakes you a pie if you’re depressed or bipolar or just struggling,” said Church. “I think this is the most important conversation for us to have on campus.”
Reddy, who is also a Crimson arts chair, echoed Church’s sentiments and added that strength stems from community.
“It’s hard to find somewhere on campus to talk about mental health,” she said. “You’re not sure when you can break the divide. We should all look around and remember these faces. I know I feel comfortable talking to all of you.”

Spades in one hand and bulbs in the other, freshmen volunteers worked alongside Harvard Yard Operations, Landscape Services, and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 to beautify the Lionel and Mower courtyard on Friday afternoon.
All freshmen received an email encouraging them to participate in the program, which was geared not only toward making the secluded space behind the Yard more aesthetically pleasing, but also toward giving freshmen a chance to meet their dean in a low-key setting.
Dingman set the tone by digging daylilies side-by-side with students—all dressed in jeans, T-shirts, and sneakers—casually chatting about freshman life.
“We send out the email to offer opportunities for freshman to make a difference, as it is not always clear for students to know how to get involved,” Dingman said.
Mark C. Muniz, an arborist for Landscape Services, directed the location of each plant based on a careful calculation of sunlight and soil conditions. “I enjoy working with students who take an interest in this,” he said.
Some students attended because of a prior penchant for gardening. “I have done this kind of work before, so I already knew it was going to be fun,” said Harry W. Hild ’16.
But gardening experience was not a prerequisite to join in on the sunny day activity. Many students who did not respond to the email walked up to volunteer on the spot.
Some students living in Lionel and Mower saw the happenings outside their windows and came to help. Gillian L. Slee ’16, a resident of Lionel, said, “It’s important to keep our section of the Yard pretty, and it’s such a beautiful day to be out here.”
The attendees also learned about eco-friendly gardening from Paul Smith, an associate manager of Landscape Services who has worked for the last few years to eliminate chemicals in the Yard. He told the students that Harvard uses no pesticides in its gardening.
“The process starts from the top down, and the leadership has really supported us in our efforts to go green,” he said.
Hild said he hoped for more opportunities to help with Harvard’s gardening. “The program should be expanded,” he said. “It helps for us to identify with our own yard and leave a lasting touch.”

The Harvard China Fund hosted a group of 15 students from Peking University in Beijing on a 10-day trip which exposed them to the American education system and social entrepreneurship. The journey inspired some students to develop their own plans to reform Chinese education.
Associate Director of the Harvard China Fund Maggie Zong hoped that the trip would give the visitors the opportunity to compare the American education system with its Chinese counterpart.
“We all know that China is undergoing educational reform and it’s time to assess what is best for students to learn and for professors to teach,” Zong said. “China is more lecture and relying on memory. The Americans’ way is more encouraging creativity and encourage freedom of thinking.”
The number of students attending Chinese universities has quadrupled in the past ten years, according to Harvard China Fund Chairman William C. Kirby. “China’s education system is growing fast in quantity and quality and the American system is not,” he said. But Kirby said he still thought the Chinese students could learn from the American system.
For the students, that hope seemed to be realized.
“What amazed me a lot is that for U.S. education, there are so many ways of designing your own path,” said Peking University student Zie Gijia. “There’s this simple and uniform way of people’s way of thinking of success [in China].”
Zong said that initially Peking University wanted the trip to focus on lectures for the visitors, in line with Chinese educational methods. She suggested that they go on field trips too.
The students’ stay included visits to private secondary school Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. and public kindergarten-through-eighth-grade Mission Hill School in Jamaica Plain. Students also audited courses at Harvard.
“I like the atmosphere in the classes. Students are very active. They like to share their opinions, whether they are for or against the professor,” student Rebekah Zhang said.
Classmate Gu Yixin opined, “I love the sense of humor in the classroom.”
For many students, the highlight of the trip was a visit to the Cambridge Innovation Center, an office space that hosts more than 450 start-up companies.
“I learned about how even the simplest ideas with actualization could make a big difference and change the world,” Yixin said.
She said the visit inspired her to begin designing plans for a program that would improve Chinese teenagers’ sense of self so that they can develop their dreams through workshops during summer or winter vacations. “In China, most of the students spend most of their time in school and they don’t have time to even ask themselves, ‘Who am I and what do I want to be?’” she said.
The Harvard China Fund enables cross-cultural inspiration to travel in both directions. It funds faculty research about China, runs summer programs for Harvard students in Asia, and maintains the Harvard Shanghai Center, the university’s physical presence in China.
“I think it would be a very valuable thing for Harvard students to go to a Chinese or European or an entirely different type of university and see the variety of different ways in which people learn and think in different national and cultural settings,” Kirby said. He said the original intent of the College’s United States in the World general education requirement was to help Harvard students view America as the rest of the world sees it.
Peking University selected the students, the majority of whom are undergraduates, out of several hundred applicants. They departed from Boston on Sunday. Zong said the Harvard China Fund hopes to repeat this program with Peking University in the future.

Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress,” the class at the center of Harvard’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory, is no longer listed as a spring 2013 course in the course catalog.
Even after Harvard announced its sweeping plagiarism investigation at the start of this semester, the listing for Government 1310 in the my.harvard course planner tool indicated that Matthew B. Platt, who has taught the course each time it has been offered, would teach it again next semester.
But now, the course planner says that Government 1310 is next expected to be offered in the 2013-14 academic year by an “instructor to be determined.”
Harvard is currently investigating about 125 students for inappropriately plagiarizing or collaborating on the final take-home exam in the 279-person spring course. Students found guilty of academic dishonesty in Government 1310 could be required to withdraw from the College for a year, among other possible punishments.
The Government 1310 course website still indicates that the course will be offered in spring 2013 and lists Platt as its professor.
Platt had taught Government 1310 for the past three spring semesters. The course has seen declining overall student ratings on the Q Guide each year, dropping from 3.70 in spring 2010 to 3.57 in spring 2011, then dipping to 2.54 in spring 2012, the semester that the alleged cheating occurred.
Platt, who is not teaching a course this semester, is currently listed in the Harvard Web Directory as an assistant professor of government.
The only class he is slated to teach in the future in the current course catalog on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s website is Government 2356: “Agenda Setting and Representation in Congress,” a graduate seminar he previously taught in fall 2010. The catalog says that Platt is expected to teach it again in the 2013-14 academic year.
Platt, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal, government department chair Timothy J. Colton, and the government department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch did not respond to requests for comment Saturday on the changed listing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter staff sponsored a homeless voter registration drive last Friday night in anticipation of the rapidly approaching presidential election.
About 20 undergraduates participated in the initiative, walking around the Cambridge area in an effort to provide homeless individuals in the area with information on how to vote and fill out the Massachusetts voter registration form.
“The homeless have the most unheard yet important opinions to voice,” said Imeime A. Umana ’14. “Even a single registration. It’s one person that wouldn’t have been able to vote otherwise.”
Before the drive, Harvard Square Homeless shelter staff and inactive Crimson photography editor Pamela Jimenez Cardenas ’13 instructed students not to make any political reference while approaching individuals and to be both careful and respectful in their interactions.
“We’re going into their space, it’s like having someone coming into your room and waking you up at night,” she said.
Participants said that many individuals who were approached were unreceptive and reluctant to fill out a voter registration form.
“[One man that was approached] filled out half of it, but then he said that he didn’t want to do it anymore,” said a student after the drive.
When asked why they didn’t want to vote, many said that the entire process was fake, that they were already registered or that they did not have time.
“I don’t know enough about politics,” said a man who was approached by participants. “I’m trying to get more information, but it’s difficult.”
Another woman, while declining to fill out a voter registration form, thanked staff members for their efforts.
“I’m all set, but thanks so much for doing this,” she said.
Homeless shelter staff members said that they were disappointed with the lack of interest in registering and said that their votes could have a profound impact.
“The more civic participation we have, the more policymakers will be accountable for their actions,” said W. Powell Eddins ’16. “So it really breaks my heart to see people not registering.”
Overall however, participants were successful in registering 17 individuals. A man approached by homeless shelter staff expressed concern that he did not have an address to provide on the voter registration form.
“I’ll go vote,” he said, after using the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter address in order to complete the information.
The voter registration drive also attracted passersby who had not had the opportunity to register yet.
“[A man] was biking by and he just stopped to fill out the form,” said a student.
After the voter registration drive, participants assembled to discuss what had occurred during the initiative. Some suggested to change the day and time of the event, as well as expand into Boston as a way to collect more registrations. The students also agreed to conduct another drive next week.
Most reported having had positive experiences, despite the limited number of individuals that were registered to vote.
“Even if they didn’t register, it’s important that they felt they count,” said Mackenzie S. Hild ’14, who helped coordinate the drive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 8, 2012, at 3:54 p.m.
When Brandy A. L. Machado ’14 began her freshman year, she told herself she would never come out of the closet.
“I distanced myself from people. I thought that every person I got close to is another person who might find out,” she said.
Raised in Lompoc, Calif., where she felt the gay community was “nonexistent,” Machado was used to hiding that she was a lesbian. At Harvard, she was still hesitant to reveal her sexual orientation. It took Machado an entire semester to decide that she would finally share her secret. She attended her first BGLTQ event in February of her freshman year—and at that first event, she met all her blockmates.
“I had an epiphany all of a sudden and said to myself: ‘All right, I’m going to do this,’” Machado said. “I told myself that I could use one less stress in second semester.”
Machado’s freshman experience was characteristic of the BGLTQ student experience just two years ago. Current upperclassmen say that they had to actively seek opportunities to meet people and to access resources for BGLTQ students. Despite the existence of spaces on campus like the Women’s Center, Contact, and Room 13, many students were unaware of the counseling services that could be found there.
However, those upperclassmen as well as a new College-funded office have strived to change circumstances for the Class of 2016. Thanks to the recent opening of the BGLTQ Office for Student Life and the restructuring of Queer Students and Allies, freshmen say they feel more comfortable coming out than their recent predecessors did.
“There’s a good vibe on campus for BGLTQ students,” Javier F. Aranzales ’16 said. “I instantly felt comfortable and decided that I was going to be myself.”
STATUS UPDATES
Even before students started flocking to Harvard for the start of the school year, many of them had already met each other online. Aranzales and fellow freshman Thomas V. Earle ’16 started a Facebook group over the summer specifically for BGLTQ students in the Class of 2016, an idea that previous classes never tried.
“We want to make this a support group off the bat for everyone in our grade,” Earle wrote to welcome new members to the group. “Share experiences, tell stories, tell jokes, sing us a song, dance on a table, do whatever you want! It’s a free world, baby! But let’s start Harvard off right! Out and proud!”
On the Facebook group, students posted links to articles and scheduled video chats. One freshman from India wrote that he had never experienced a BGLTQ community. The post received 31 comments from peers expressing their support.
“We bonded through posting or sending articles, and it became apparent early on that this was a pretty accepting place,” said Garrett C. Allen ’16, who was a member of the Facebook group. “Even upperclassmen joined the group. They gave us advice and talked about how accepting the community was in general. It definitely made the transition easier.”
Students have also used their own Facebook pages as a means of publicly coming out. Jordan T. Weiers ‘16, who has his Facebook profile set to “Interested in: Men,” said that this very open display of sexual orientation helped to avoid uncomfortable conversations with roommates.
“There was never a moment when I had to say, ‘Hey guys, guess what: I’m gay!’” Weiers said. “It just wasn’t necessary. They knew and they understood.”
A 'LIBERAL HAVEN'
Several students who openly identify as BGLTQ said that they come from towns that are not as accepting of their sexual orientations as Harvard is, and the Class of 2016 is no different. They said that the environment on campus, however, is particularly conducive to coming out.
“I come from this place in Minnesota called Savage—I kid you not,” Weiers said. “There are a lot of evangelical Christians in the area, and there’s a lot of hatred when it comes to LGBTQ people.”
In comparison, Weiers and others refer to Boston—and particularly Harvard—as a “liberal haven.” Students said they find the campus to be generally very respectful.
“I got here and I suddenly felt very free,” said Indiana T. Seresin ’15, who grew up in London. “Acceptance just wasn’t there at my high school, but I’m comfortable now that I’m here.”
For Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, joining the First-Year Urban Program helped him realize how many BGLTQ students there were on campus.
“A large number of the FUP leaders in my year and this year were BGLTQ students,” said Bayard, who returned to FUP this year as a leader himself. “I remember going to a panel to talk about BGLTQ issues and at least half of the FUP leaders were leading the panel.”
Daniel, a current freshman whose name has been changed because his parents do not know that he is gay, said he felt that FUP made queer identity part of a larger conversation.
“Even students who were straight were sharing stories of how they discovered they were straight and came out,” he said. “It really made me feel like I was no different and that I was part of the larger community.”
HOT SPOTS
The Class of 2016 comes to Harvard at the same time as Harvard’s first-ever paid director of BGLTQ student life, who heads the office for BGLTQ students that opened in March.
“The creation of a centralized office is a big deal,” freshman proctor Joseph J. Vitti ’10 said. “It sends the message that there is a community here for you, even if there may be people who don’t accept you.”
Laura V. Herrera ’13, co-chair of Gay, Lesbians, Or, Whatever, said that the office can act as a unifying space for BGLTQ life on campus, something she had felt was missing.
“I never felt part of the BGLTQ community as understood by the QSA,” she said. “QSA membership was primarily made up of middle-class white males and never actively tried to reach out to queer students of color. I think we are divided.”
Some students like Herrera have left QSA for more specific BGLTQ groups like GLOW, for students of color; the Trans Task Force, for students who identify as transgender; and BAGELS, for queer students who are Jewish.
All those groups have stopped by the new office. Kenneth Mai ’15, the treasurer of QSA, said that he was glad to see the entire space filled at the open house held in the office in August.
Meanwhile, Mai said that the QSA is restructuring the way the organization works to make it more inclusive for the Class of 2016. Instead of being obligated to attend a certain number of events to be placed on the mailing list, all students have to do now is check a box on a form to indicate interest.
“Our goal is not to make all students come to QSA,” he said. “The goal is to make sure that everyone feels happy and safe and that those people who need help and who want a sense of community have somewhere to go.”
IT GETS BETTER
Students still point out concrete ways that Harvard can make new students more comfortable.
Sasanka N. Jinadasa ’15 mentioned the annual required instructive program Sex Signals for freshmen as an example of a heteronormative Harvard tradition.
“They offer an alternate Sex Signals for BGLTQ students, but I can’t imagine it’d be that difficult to create a general safe sex presentation for all sexualities,” Jinadasa said. “If this continues, not only are queer students made to go to a different event, they are publicly ostracized from a communal freshman experience.”
This year, freshman proctors were given copies of the book “It Gets Better” by Dan Savage and Terry Miller to help them become more sensitive to some of the problems students may be facing.
Vitti, who volunteered to specialize in BGLTQ freshman life as a proctor, said that he also acts as an extra resource for freshmen who are questioning their sexuality.
“I’m here to listen, above all else, and maybe give advice where I can,” he said.
Seresin, who is a Peer Advising Fellow for freshmen and is also a Crimson magazine writer, said that while proctors are more aware of issues of sexuality among students thanks to the book giveaway, there still are not enough BGLTQ PAFs.
“Nearly every single PAF is straight,” she said. “They should start asking about sexuality on the PAF application, because freshmen may need someone to talk to besides their proctor.”
But on the whole, even Bayard—who has critiqued many Harvard policies through the Occupy movement last fall and other protests—called Harvard a great place to be a BGLTQ-identifying student.
“I rarely give praise to Harvard, but it really doesn’t do a terrible job,” he said. “I think people are uncomfortable with feeling uncomfortable about different sexual orientations here, which is pretty rare.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tale of the Harvard men’s soccer season seems to be one of missed opportunities.
On a windy Saturday afternoon, No. 18 Cornell (10-0-0, 2-0-0 Ivy) came into Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium and extended its winning streak to 10 games as it defeated the Crimson (1-6-3, 0-1-1 Ivy), 3-1.
Harvard had most of the momentum on offense in the first half, recording eight shots to Cornell’s two. But the Crimson only capitalized on one of its chances and went into halftime knotted at one.
“That’s been the story of the season,” co-captain Scott Prozeller said. “We’ve been in games and we’ve had chances, [but] we haven’t finished them, and then we find ways to give up goals.”
The Big Red jumped out to an early lead, but the Crimson struck back to tie the score at one before the break. In the 43rd minute, junior defender Ross Friedman launched a long ball to freshman forward Jake Freeman, who collected it out of the air and took a touch towards the six-yard line.
Big Red goalkeeper Rick Pflasterer came up with a diving save, but the keeper was unable to corral the ball, and freshman forward Oliver White buried the rebound into the back of the net to score Harvard’s lone goal for the contest. The tally was White’s second of the season and the Crimson’s first Ivy League score.
“We knew they were coming in undefeated, definitely with a ton of confidence, but we thought they really hadn’t been tested at all,” Prozeller said. “I thought we dominated the first half and did really good, so it was just an unfortunate result.”
The momentum shifted away from the Crimson after halftime, as the Big Red outshot Harvard, 9-5, in the second half following tactical changes.
“Their tactics definitely changed [after the half],” Prozeller said. “They have a lot of team speed, and maybe we’re a little slower across the back, a bit more tactical. They put balls in behind us and squeezed us. We definitely struggled with that at times.”
Cornell took back the lead 63 minutes into the match when sophomore midfielder Conor Goepel sent a lofted pass across the box over freshman goaltender Joe Festa. Big Red defender Patrick Slogic then headed the ball from the far post into the net to put Cornell ahead for the rest of the contest.
The Big Red’s third tally came with 15 minutes left in the game off of a Crimson turnover to seal the victory for Cornell. Big Red forward Tyler Regan found Goepel open in the box, who then slotted the ball past Festa for the final goal of the contest.
In the first six minutes of the game, Harvard had three chances to take the lead, but failed to score on each attempt.
Senior forward Zack Wolfenzon dribbled the ball down the line and fired a shot from the right side of the field, but Pflasterer was there to push the ball to the side.  Junior forward Connor McCarthy grabbed the rebound off the block and drove the ball towards the net, but a Cornell defender cleared his attempt to give the Crimson a corner kick.
Off the corner, junior midfielder Kyle Henderson sent the ball into the box. Prozeller unleashed a header at the goal, but Big Red defender Peter Chodas blocked his shot.
Less than four minutes later, Cornell forward Stephen Reisert gave the Big Red the first goal of the game, firing the ball into the right side of the net off of a through pass from Cornell forward Nico Nissl that had split the Harvard defense.
Despite the bounty of shots created early on in the game, Harvard coach Carl Junot still thinks that the Crimson offense has room to improve.
“You try to create opportunities, and you try to finish opportunities,” Junot said. “The more opportunities you create, the more chances you have to score. I thought we could have been better at producing more offense.”
Harvard pressured the Big Red throughout the first half, but had to open up its defense as it went on the offensive in the second half following Cornell’s late goals. The Crimson held Big Red forward Daniel Haber, who leads the nation in points per game, scoreless for just the second time all season, but couldn’t maintain its defensive showing throughout the match.

It's never too early to begin planning for Halloween, and with this Monday freebie in your schedule, now is the perfect time to pop by the Garment District in Kendall Square, a thrift store that sells costumes by the pound. Walk away with a cheap costume and be prepared three weeks in advance.
Island Hopping
Past the edifices of Boston lie the Boston Harbor Islands, where over 30 islands await you. Filled with history, hiking, and beaches, the islands have something for everyone. To get there, take the Harbor Islands Ferry that departs from Long Wharf North in Boston to Georges Island, where you can then find shuttle ferries that will lead you to fantastic little places with names like Bumpkin Island and World's End.
Get Cultured
The Fenway Alliance brings to Boston the annual Opening Our Doors, where community organizations and cultural and academic institutions get together to provide a day full of free activities. Spend the day wandering the Fenway area munching on free cupcakes, trying your hand at glass blowing, building a kite, or embossing silver.
Christian Science Plaza, October 8 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
J.P. Lovin'
You've been in an urban environment for a while now, and while campus is gorgeous, it might be time to reconnect with your inner nature-loving hippie self. Brilliant oranges, reds and yellows are coloring the trees, and Jamaica Pond offers leaf peeping like no other. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the Pond hosts a 1.5 mile walking path and also offers rowboat, kayak, and sailboat rentals for the more nautically inclined.
Jamaica Pond Boat House, Monday-Sunday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., until sunset on Thursdays and Saturdays.
