After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to North Korea’s official country website, “Literature and art in the DPRK perform a mission as a textbook for life that educates the popular masses in a revolutionary way and inspire them for creative labor and as a weapon for struggle.” In this secretive country, creative endeavors are not outlets for authentic expression; they’re tools for entrenching government elites. Yet Adam Johnson chooses to ground his most recent work of fiction in this mysterious and foreboding country. In “The Orphan Master’s Son,” he masterfully portrays the difficulties of living in a society whose self-perception is in itself a work of fiction, where truth is ultimately as elusive as the fate of the protagonist Pak Jun Do’s kidnapped mother. In the harsh world of North Korea, however, Jun Do’s personal development often comes across as one-dimensional and emotionally unsatisfying; overall, though, Johnson includes a variety of other compelling characters and tells a fascinating story with a complex metafictional narrative.
Jun Do encounters a variety of unexpected situations—he is forced to kidnap people, to travel to Texas, and to go to prison camp—but through all these adventures, Johnson fails to develop depth and personality in this character. Jun Do incessantly bemoans his situation and lack of control in the first half of the book, yet Johnson shows no conviction in Jun Do. “And what choice did he have, about anything?” Johnson writes about Jun Do. Through all the miseries of his life, he fails to do more than list them—reflection is, apparently, not part of his personality. “He couldn’t help that he was from a town lacking in electricity and heat and fuel, where the factories were frozen in rust, where able-bodied men were either in labor camps or were listless with hunger,” Johnson writes dispassionately. His character is merely a placeholder for a general type. In a novel this narratively complex, however, this technique actually often allows Jun Do to act as foil to the complex and dynamic secondary characters, who provide the requisite emotional aspects to make this novel a success.
The two halves of the novel feature markedly different narrative structures. The first half is told as a straightforward third-person account of the early life and career of Jun Do. The plot moves quickly; Johnson wastes no time on emotional intricacies and focuses instead on the bizarre circumstances of Jun Do’s life. He grows up in an orphanage as the son of its director, becomes a kidnapper and fighter extraordinaire, and eventually steals the identity of one of the most powerful men in the country. A detached tone mirrors and enhances Jun Do’s own lack of control in certain aspects of his life—for in this world, the government determines the course of an individual’s life. While Johnson’s authorial technique is effective, it remains difficult and sometimes unsatisfying to have a protagonist so wholly removed from the typical self-reflection in most novels.
Yet Johnson chooses to break away from Jun Do’s account in the second half of the book, which injects an exciting layer of mystery and uncertainty into this otherwise straightforward plotline. The narration switches between three compelling voices: a state-employed interrogator, the propaganda-spewing loudspeakers found in every North Korean home, and the same third person account of Jun Do from the beginning of the novel. The action still centers about Jun Do, but the new variety of perspectives on his life forces the reader to piece together reality from disparate accounts. The change in technique brings the novel’s internal tension between truth and government-created fiction into the fabric of the narrative.
The setting of “The Orphan Master’s Son” resembles a traditional, fictional dystopian society—yet the fact that this is a real nation, not an invented horror world, makes it much creepier. The North Korea imagined by Johnson is a country controlled by uncertainty. The government seems to have utter disregard for the truth; no character is safe from its infinite output of propaganda, prison, and death. Yet there is something undeniably sympathetic and even pathetic about the state Johnson portrays, particularly of its all-powerful ruler Kim Jong-Il. At one point, for example, the dictator wants to outdo a visiting senator from Texas. Kim Jong-Il has heard about an American 45-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver, so he has his own revolver built. “It was constructed by our own engineers and is actually a forty-six caliber, a little bigger, a little more powerful than the American model—do you think it will embarrass them?” he wonders. He is so obviously misguided, taken in by his own propagandist lies about the “backwards” nation of America, that his reaction is more humorous than frightening. Despite this useful levity, there remains a dictator who places no value in truth in the lives of his subjects.
Amidst the backdrop of this bizarre country, Johnson’s secondary characters emerge as unique creations. One character in particular, the interrogator-biographer, is eminently more interesting than Jun Do, which may be because his story unfolds from his own perspective. “Our team discovers an entire life, with all its subtleties and motivations,” the interrogator says, “and then crafts it into a single, original volume that contains the person himself. When you have a subject’s biography, there is nothing between the citizen and the state. That’s harmony, that’s the idea our nation is founded upon.” Though he cannot help but be somewhat taken in by the lies of the government, he truly sees the importance of documenting the real stories of North Koreans. Through his eyes, Johnson gives the most painful sense of the utter intractability of truth in a society consumed by its own fictions.
In “The Orphan Master’s Son,” Johnson crafts an exquisite presentation of the tension between reality and propaganda. Even the work’s greatest flaw—its flat, underdeveloped protagonist—may be justified by this end, for perhaps his story is more important than the particulars of his personality. Johnson acknowledges the value of fiction as an important medium for creativity but warns of the perils of valuing fiction more than truth.

The much-maligned Millennial generation  has been accused of many things: laziness, ingratitude, and gluttony, to name a few. If these terms apply to any 20-something, they apply to Eli Schwartz, the perfectly depressing embodiment of modern America. He is overweight and jobless, lives in a basement, and uses copious amounts of drugs. As the product of divorced parents who spoiled him out of guilt, Eli has quite a repugnant personality. Yet in his poignant debut novel “Flatscreen,” author Adam Wilson introduces a pensive and sensitive side to a character that, based on first impressions alone, is easy to abhor. The book is an effective homage to a generation of Facebook-obsessed, thin-skinned internet nomads. This timely topic creates an allure to Wilson’s writing, and college readers may sense in the realist work a pang of self-recognition. Yet instead of veering into pretentious judgement of an emerging generation, he instead grounds his novel in sharp wit and satirical slant—an impressive and unexpected amalgamation of J.D. Salinger’s commentary on youth and South Park’s relentlessly crass yet astute observations.
Eli’s existence, which is usually spent in a tattered L.L. Bean robe, consists of nothing more than television, food, drugs, the internet, and daydreaming about futures he could never attain and girls he could never sleep with. He is dependent almost to the point of parody: he lives off the guilt-sodden checks from his unfaithful father, takes advantage of his helpless mother, and burdens his older brother. At the beginning of the novel, Eli’s mother’s house is sold to a paraplegic, drug-addled, lonely, and sex-addicted retired TV star named Seymour Kahn. His life runs parallel to Eli’s sense of purposelessness; the pair soon become close, and Kahn assumes a position of a father figure, albeit one with unlimited access to Oxycontin and prostitutes.
Eli is a typical burnout—high in synagogue, high in high school, high at Thanksgiving—and, having grown up comfortably middle-class, he cannot defend his drug habits with an excuse of life on the streets. His sheltered and spoiled life makes him the farthest thing from a pitiable character, at least judged from the advantageous circumstances in which he was born. However, through his narration of the story, the reader gains insight to his mind—and that mind is surprisingly relatable. After a drastic disappointment, he thinks, “I’d seen this movie. Obvious ending: outright betrayal, lesson learned, life is heartbreak, people who mean well still fuck you over, everyone’s sad, greedy, looking out for number one, no consideration for the fragile fat boy whose displayed cynicism only masks a deeper hope that everyone’s okay, will ultimately end up all right, that love exists, that happiness may not be stable but at least comes in bursts, that everything worthwhile wasn’t just a self-created illusion.” His self-awareness is compelling, and his ability to honestly voice his often meaningful and depressingly realistic opinions is a boon to the story.
As Eli drifts through life on a constant high, he replaces his familial and friendly relationships with the soft sigh of a hit of a joint, the swift excitement of a line of coke, and the numbing embrace of various pills, crack, and even a stint with Viagra. His dependence on these drugs for variety in his life catalyzes a series of events that lead to his being cut off from his father, becoming a YouTube sensation, sleeping with a married woman and then getting beat up for it, and getting shot. These moments of mindlessness, however, sometimes come off as trite moralizing on the part of the author, which distracts from the selfish and drifting nature of the protagonist’s worldview.
Unexpectedly, and to the book’s credit, there is ultimately no predictable eye-opening realization by Eli that his life would be better without an endless barrage of drugs. Wilson delves deeper into the psychological and societal underpinnings of Eli’s drug abuse and complete self-centeredness. He explores the result of growing up with unloving parents (“My existence underscored her failure,” says Eli of his mother), living with no perceptible drive for a successful future, and never needing to work for anything.
Complete with lists, short chapters, inconclusive tangents, citations of films, screenplay snippets, and subject-less verbs, the book is a literary reflection of society’s short attention span. “Ways In Which I am Like a Rapper,” Eli posits. “Absent father, bullet hole, verbal dexterity, limited education, love of butts.” Wilson writes for a modern audience with an insatiable appetite for constant fast news, and he employs various writing tools to help the reader remain interested. He masterfully couples deep musings with forceful droll to create the perfect oxymoron: a likable asshole. His writing—like the rapper list—is fresh and witty and drips with both pop culture references and philosophical morsels that create a reading experience that is enjoyable beyond a superficial level. The story seems too generally dark, however, for its marketed label of comedy; the lives of the various characters are reminiscent of the lives of countless suburban families depressingly hiding behind material possessions.
Wilson concludes the novel adroitly, given its focus on a genuinely mediocre character for whom a traditional happy ending seems implausible. He concocts 19 “Possible Endings,” from which the readers can claim their own desired conclusion. At first glance, this is perhaps a cowardly way to end a story, yet Wilson pulls it off and gives at least a glimmer of hope in Eli’s future.
This arresting and raunchy novel begs attention. Wilson’s practically flawless ability to meld a philosophizing monologue with a scene of someone drugged out on a high school football field with an enormous erection creates a balanced novel for both those who want to be entertained and those who want to be inspired.

“I have a story. It isn’t my story—I’ve never seen a ghost,” read Kelly Link from her short story “Two Houses” at the Brattle Theater on Thursday. Link, an author of short stories and winner of the World Fantasy Award, was joined at the event by Gregory Maguire, the acclaimed author of the “Wicked” series. The two authors represent two different facets of fantasy literature: while Link focuses on real-world horror and mystery, Maguire is famous for his revision of L. Frank Baum’s “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.” Both, however, were invited by the Harvard Book Store to speak on their respective collections of short stories—Maguire’s “Tales Told in Oz” and Link’s “Stone Animals.”
The talk featured readings from their earlier works, followed by a question-and-answer session and book signing. The discussion employed a similar format as a talk show; the two authors engaged in conversations and questions with each other as the audience looked on. “We tend to let the authors who are speaking decide for themselves the format for the evening, and I think that they had it work really smoothly,” said Bethy A. Atkins, the organizer of the talk. The tone of the event thus rested heavily on the dynamic between the two authors, as well as the differences in their literary styles and approaches to writing.
The audience had the opportunity to hear the personalities that lay behind the authors’ works. As Link read an excerpt from her short story “Two Houses,” her mellow voice worked well with her spooky take on magical realism and science fiction. Maguire especially admired her reading of “Two Houses,” which unfolds like an anecdote from friend to friend: “I was listening to the fluidity and the casualness of the delivery of your sentences,” he commented. “I work very fast and also very rococo, so that was interesting to hear you.”
As the two writers’ commentaries bounced off of each other, the differences in how they each translated their ideas into literature became clear. While Link’s writing, much like her stage presence, was very calm, Maguire’s excerpt was a performance full of energy, which reflected his animated personality. He read from “Out of Oz,” the fourth and final book of The Wicked Years series. “The roots and the fundament of my four-volume book series really rest in the work L. Frank Baum did in his original tales of Oz in bringing depth and balance and range to that original story,” said Maguire. In his new book “Tales Told in Oz,” which is his first foray into short stories, he elaborates upon various subplots mentioned during The Wicked Years series.
Link and Maguire also compared their approaches to writing, especially in their recent short stories publications. “I often think of writing anything really as being one of those terrible dreams in which you’re a circus performer, and you just start running up along the high wire, and once you start you can’t stop, because once you stop moving you’ll topple over and die,” Maguire said. “That’s what writing makes me feel like, and once I get the first sentence I start running and completely forget the nerve in the work that I have to do.”
Maguire’s reason for writing rests on his need for a mental break from daily life. “It was a way to escape my large family, find a voice that was my own, find a world that was my own,” he said. This inspiration is apparent in the fantastical universe of Oz that Maguire recreated. In the spirit of a true inventor, he manipulated Baum’s original world of Oz to create something that is uniquely his own.
Link, however, works in a very different way from Maguire. “I start in a little bit, and then I go back to the beginning, and then I go in a little bit further, and I do this the entire way through,” she said about her writing process. And her fascination with horror stems not from a personal outlet, but from her interest in readers’ reactions to the genre. “I asked a writer [why he read horror], and he said he read for the feeling of dread,” she said. “And it really struck a chord with me.”
Thus the casual tone of Link’s writing mirrors the telling of a ghost story. “Tell it as if you’re telling a story to a friend, not even think of it as writing, but like you’re trying to tell a friend something weird or depressing, and don’t worry about whether or not it has an ending or if it makes sense,” she said. “The trick is to try to keep somebody interested in what you’re saying.” By skewing aspects of reality, Link creates a distorted lens through which readers view her stories.
In this respect, Link and Maguire have different approaches to “worldbuilding,” or the process of developing the environment in which stories unfold. Both authors discussed the effect and repercussion of this literary technique in their own endeavors. While Maguire has built his writing around the world of Oz, Link never returns to the same world in her work. “I think that probably the way that I write short stories is that I rely less on worldbuilding, which I don’t trust myself to do,” she said. “It’s more sort of a way of seeing how can I convey differently something that already exists.”
Meanwhile, Maguire likes the idea of adding different facets to already existing material. “Worldbuilding is a lot like interior decoration,” he said. “It’s placing things in juxtaposition in such a way as to suggest the greatest amount of both value and mystery. And that’s what I aim for.”
Maguire and Link’s works highlight just how much creative space the fantasy genre leaves for experimentation. “[The authors] both are in the sort of fantastical realm that we thought have a nice counterpoint to each other,” Atkins said. “Their topics speak to each other in a way, because they’re both in these fantasy, science-fiction worlds.”
Ultimately, both authors agree that being a writer not only means creating something new, but also finding an identity through writing and disseminating a personal message through it. “You have to know your own voice,” Maguire said. “However foolish your job is, you have to go after it yourself.”

The film title “Intruders” concocts imagery of two bumbling robbers about to vandalize the house while a babysitter idly flips through talk shows and football games. However, the actual film features a welcome intrusion of psychological terror—a bizarre mash-up of “666” and “Inception”—that evades some common pitfalls of the horror genre. With a convincingly younger cast and a refreshing premise that still pays homage to films that came before, “Intruders” stands as an engaging re-interpretation of its genre.
The film splits its time between two seemingly-unrelated children, both of whom are haunted by a type of ghoul called Hollowface. This faceless ghost possesses only one goal in life: to tear the face off of a child to wear in an attempt to find love after losing his own face after 10 years in solitary confinement. One victim and his family live in a derelict abode in Spain; the other lives in an idyllic community in England. In a genre where directors might choose to reveal the villainous specter only at the very end, it is refreshing to know the hauntees and the haunter upfront.
Approximately two minutes into the film, Hollowface enters the room of Juan (Izán Corchero). The little British girl, Mia (Ella Purnell), sets up the suspense as she reads aloud—during a fairly comical scene that shows her terrified third grade class—a story about Hollowface. Shortly after, Mia is grabbed one night by the ghoul, yet is saved by her father (Clive Owen). After listening to the father’s harrowing account, the psychiatrist diagnoses both father and daughter as having the same disorder, one that causes two emotionally bonded people to share the same delusions. This pathologization raises the movie’s central question—is Mia’s dysphoria caused from the trauma of a normal intruder, as her psychiatrists claim, or is it real because Hollowface is succeeding in his attempts to strip away Mia’s sanity? In this way, the film’s strongest aspect is the doubt about whether Hollowface exists or stands merely as a product of Mia and her father’s imagination.
While Juan is repeatedly frightened by Hollowface, his mother claims not to believe him. Yet she too goes for help, but from the local priest, a nice homage to horror classic “The Exorcist.” The priest, believing both the mother and the son to be insane, still goes through tremendous effort to create an elaborate ritual to “save” the little boy. We are left to assume this is because of the vague sexual tension that exists between him and Juan’s mother, one of the sadly underdeveloped points in the film. In comparison to Mia’s storyline, “Intruders” focuses more on a strange type of mysticism in Juan’s family. With better acting ability and a tighter, better-explained plot on the other side of the Channel, it is a relief that the action switches back to Mia’s plight.
After Mia’s father is banned from seeing her, he desperately wanders the streets of London when he brilliantly connects the stories of Juan and Mia—the high point of the movie. However, the movie’s lowest point quickly follows as he reveals Hollowface’s identity in hopes he will set Mia free. The explanation of Hollowface’s identity is illogical and unbelievable, which deprives the movie from a tight, well-written conclusion.
The fault does not lie with the actors not being able to pull off a convincing reveal. Rather, Owen’s performance is nuanced and thus strong. For a movie focused more on fear than finesse, Owen brings a warmth and a strength to the screen in an attempt to convey a father’s imperative to protect his daughter—in this case against both the actual horror and the adult establishment’s disbelief—while still paying due attention to the other role of detective his character is forced to play.
“Intruders” features tight directing and convincingly dreary scenery. The camera work and the dialogue are fluid and compelling, despite a distracting tendency to overuse the soundtrack to create a jarring, melodramatic vibe. However, production values usually mean very little in psychological horror films. It is the characters that make “Intruders” an understated, interesting film. The actors did not overreact with slack jaws or buggy eyes and thus seemed as realistic as possible in an obviously unrealistic situation. It is a new type of horror story, creatively concocted and subtlely told, with a reliance on new myths and establishments to create fear, even if the ending reaches a somewhat convoluted conclusion.

The 1976 cartoon version of “The Lorax”—a simple message about the ramifications of environmental abuse—has been replayed in public high schools for nearly 30 years. Now, a hefty helping of left-wing, environmentalist propaganda blatantly misuses Dr. Seuss—who is rightly considered as more nonsensical children’s poet than radical warrior. Director Chris Renaud has transformed a memorable story into the spectacle that is the new eponymous 3D recreation. Based on Seuss’ 1971 children’s book, the film is an overbearing bastardization of the original, understated message to be kind to the environment.
“The Lorax” follows the 12 year-old protagonist Ted Wiggins (Zac Efron) as he attempts to win over Audrey (Taylor Swift), the girl of his dreams, by finding something which has not existed for years in their hometown, Thneedville: the Truffula tree. The counsel of his wacky Grammy Norma (Betty White) leads him outside of Thneedville to the home of a hermit called the Once-ler who explains that he came to the virgin land of Thneedville long ago to capitalize on an invention called the Thneed, a useless Snuggie-like piece of fabric that serves as a symbol of senseless consumerism that requires the fluffy leaves of Truffula trees.
The Once-ler ultimately destroys the Truffula forest despite long monologues by the Lorax (Danny DeVito), a furious, furry creature who magically appears whenever the Once-ler takes one more step towards creating an ecological hell. Now, a mean-to-the-bone villain, Aloysius O’Hare (Rob Riggle), rules over the terribly polluted Thneedville and sells residents fresh air, therefore holding a vested interest in thwarting Ted’s mission to replant the Truffula trees. Then, like any children’s movie, there is a chase scene, pretty colors, and some cringe-worthy tunes interspersed with some subtle adult-appeasing jokes. Halfway through the film, for example, a Budweiser-esque ad for O’Hare’s Air warns people to “please breathe responsibly.”
Not even the celebrity medley of Efron, Swfit, White, and DeVito is enough to distract from the cookie-cutter blandness of the film’s characters. For example, Swift’s character, Audrey, is a lot of a “desired object” than self-aware character. She has very little to say, hardly any hand in helping the story’s hero, and all of the superficialities of the archetypal distressed damsel. On the other side, main villain O’Hare, who embodies as the greedy nightmare of a white, male, corporate, capitalist requires a knowledge of the 2008 Wall Street crisis to appreciate.
Understandably, “The Lorax” would not be “The Lorax” without its moral imperative. Seuss did pen the book a year after the first Earth Day, and most of his stories are well known for sliding a moral or two between the lines—even if it’s only to stop being such a Grinch. But the original Seussian message was a simple one: be wary of the resources you use. The simplicity of this message is lost in the  film with a plethora of cute animals and endless barrage of colors and motion that the director most likely included to try and keep his elementary-aged audience’s attention.
When the message does shine through, the strength of it becomes  overwhelming. One of the film’s most representative songs, “How Bad Can I Be,” features the Once-ler at his corporate-coddling, Wall-Street-waltzing best. He drops a list of lines that refer back to concepts like Social Darwinism, which, for the average five year-old, are as accessible as Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason.
The end result is a film that falls far outside the book’s original scope. The slap-stick comedy, queasy 3D motion-inducing nausea, and hit-and-miss animation might be enough to appease children superficially. However, parents will have to amuse themselves with an inculcation of environmentalism that their children will miss altogether.

Scraped knees, a helmet askew, and the first tenuous wobbling of a bike whose training wheels have just been taken off—it is said that you never forget how to ride a bike. The French-language film “The Kid with a Bike” shows how one boy is forced to never forget the suffering at the hands of his negligent father. However, while the movie does not end happily, the development of young Cyril (Thomas Doret) and the relationship between Cyril and his father, Guy Cutul (Jérémie Renier), creates a film that the viewer will never be able to forget as well.
“The Kid With a Bike” won the Grand Prix at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, and it delivers a tale of a child whose derelict father abandons him to foster care. The film journeys into Cyril’s emotional breakdown as he navigates an Oliver Twist-esque survival story set in modern-day Belgium. Directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne create a formidable tension from the very first scene as young Cyril escapes from his foster home to desperately search for his father whom he refuses to believe has abandoned him. Guy lies to his son, saying he will return to the foster home, and when Cyril returns to his father’s old apartment, he finds that it has been indeed abandoned. In a sad show of denial, Cyril reasons that his prized possession, his bike, has been stolen, unable to grasp the reality that his father probably sold it. Through a twist of fate, Cyril has the good fortune of running into Samantha (Cécile de France) a good-hearted hair dresser who becomes his foster mother. The bike becomes a ubiquitious symbol, providing the means for Cyril to discover the agonizing truth that he will never again be able to depend on his father.
Doret’s portrayal of Cyril’s emotional turmoil goes beyond the boy’s years. Although the character can sometimes be a frustrating example of youth, his presence and believable interactions with supporting characters are what creates a gripping story. Doret’s superb gift of portraying tension with limited dialogue shows his ability to really embody the idea of “less is more.”  Long speeches are nonexistent, but his short, succinct answers do not prevent the audience to from feeling a lesser degree of angst. Halfway through the movie, it becomes apparent that what Cyril does not say helps to create a more developed character than what he does.
One scene that is crucial for setting up the film’s stakes and the boy’s tumultuous relationship with his father is when Cyril, on an obsessive journey to find his father, stops at a convenience store to find the advertisement for his own bike being sold by his father before he skips town. The expected reaction would be an outburst of anger, yet he simply asks the man behind the counter if he knows the address of his father. The man says he doesn’t, looks back at him, and coldly asks why he doesn’t know his own address. Cyril replies “I forgot.” Such a simple reply exemplifies his pent-up anger and sadness without needless extrapolation.
One of the film’s only weaknesses centers around Cyril’s relationship with auxiliary characters. Although Samantha struggles to connect with Cyril, her reasons for helping him remain a mystery and an explanation could have made her character more complex than the trite portrayal of a generic good Samaritan. For example, Samantha leaves her boyfriend after Cyril talks back to him despite there being no clear reason why Samantha would choose to stay with the boy. Similarly, his interactions with local gang leader, Wesker, could have created an interesting father-figure dynamic to serve as a foil.
The ending of the movie leaves the viewers wondering whether they should be impressed by the director’s boldness or disappointed by loose ends. However, the film’s contemplative ending creates a memorable whole.

Twelfth Night
April 5-7, 7:30 p.m.,
April 6 10:30 p.m.,  April 7 2:00 p.m.
The Loeb Ex
Directed by Susanna B. Wolk ’13
Produced by Andrew N. Shindi ’13, Janet J. Eom ’14, Joe G. Hodgkin ’12
Avid Shakespeare fans will be celebrating this year’s on-again, off-again winter with a topsy-turvy rendition of the Bard’s classic play “Twelfth Night.” The comedy, originally written for the end of the Christmas season, is getting a remix that plays up the silly fun found in this classic tale of swapped identities. Not only has the Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s production of the work been revamped for a modern-day audience, it also includes a brand new score for Shakespeare’s own lyrics.
According to Olivia L. Ball ’14, who plays Viola, this production is not just another “She’s the Man” spin-off of the gender-bending, couple-swapping tale. “I defy the Amanda Bynes inspiration. I think of Viola as wonderful and daring in so many ways,” she says. In fact, the whole show is an experiment in updating this popular text. “You constantly have to think of new motivations, new ways of looking at things, new ways of making it funny,” says Ball. So instead of spreading across the shipwrecked shores of Illyria, the action will take place at a riotous music festival, featuring live ukulele music written by musical directors Anise Molina ’14 and Kyra A. Atekwana ’14 and inspired by Regina Spektor, Ingrid Michaelson, and Ben Folds.
Despite these additions, the production retains all the satirical humor found in the original. First-time director Susanna B. Wolk ’14 decided to play up the raunchy jokes, cruel tricks, and secret crushes that would have made even Elizabethan theatergoers blush. The actors—most of them Hyperion veterans such as Ball, Josh G. Wilson ’13, Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14, and Amelia H. Ross ’14—have the skills to be silly in Shakespearean verse. However, Wolk feels that that her cast is entering new territory with this staging. “[This is] a crazy place where everything is not quite right, people’s passions and emotions ride high, and nobody holds back,” she says.
In “Twelfth Night” the Loeb Ex becomes a music hall for hippies, a fashion runway for American Apparel androgynes, and a battlefield for paintball fights. This new production is sure to be full of surprises and stimulants, just like the Bard’s wacky imagination.

Brooklyn-based indie rock band Bear in Heaven recently came off of a world tour to promote its highly acclaimed 2009 album, “Beast Rest Forth Mouth.” The album and tour featured the band at its peak, and Bear in Heaven’s latest album, “I Love You, It’s Cool,” is an attempt to build on its success. “It felt good when people would dance. We tried to turn that into a record,” guitarist Adam Wills recently commented in a press release. “But there’s still an absolute need to take the pop song and ruin it.” With “I Love You, It’s Cool,” Bear in Heaven ultimately achieves these two goals, but it fulfills the latter in a different way than Wills intended. The album’s icy synths and driving electronic beats make the record danceable at times. However, its overwhelming repetition and lack of musical innovation reveal that the band’s attempt at ruining the pop song results in, save for a few standout tracks, a tedious ruin.
“I Love You, It’s Cool” is significantly less poppy than previous releases like “Beast Rest Forth Mouth.” Whereas “Lovesick Teenagers,” a prominent single on that album, featured clever lyrics—“Lovesick teenagers don’t ever die / They will live forever / Even when you’re too old”—and crisp melodic lines, this album concentrates much more on contemplative, mellow soundscapes. Overall, the band’s songs feel like semi-conscious attempts made after waking up from amorphous nightmares. Single words, like “freakout,” are repeated over and over in a monotone, and layers of rhythmic synthesizers and guitars fade in and out with little room for the songs to breathe.
“World of Freakout” and “Space Remains” both display the stagnancy that characterizes the album. The ambient and droning synths seem to simply cover up for a lack of catchy melodies. In “Space Remains,” the steady energy of the drums is watered down by the incessant elongation of each syllable in the chorus. Moreover, embarrassingly angsty lyrics, although barely heard above the wash, do nothing to improve the blandness; on “Sweetness and Sickness,” frontman Jon Philpot mutters, “The dreams / sad beloved trains / Sadness / Never feels the same.”
However, Bear in Heaven shows glimpses of its former intelligent songwriting and arrangement, as shown by “The Reflection of You,” recently released as a single. With its shimmering keyboard riff, steady 16th-note drum pulse, and clear melody, the song is decidedly more upbeat than much of the rest of the album. The song builds synth upon synth up to the song’s climax, in which Philpot sings softly, “dance with me.” This tension and release demonstrates a movement that many other songs sorely lack. The atmosphere of hazy allure is well reflected in lines Philpot so relishingly murmurs. “My lips won’t kiss anything amazing / My lips won’t respond / I wanna know exactly what you are.” More than a half-hearted diatribe against one’s own romantic fate, “Reflection of You” is particularly soothing, especially when sandwiched between the darker and more aggressive songs “Idle Heart” and “Noon Moon.”
Another standout from the disturbingly homogenous crowd is the fourth track, “Sinful Nature.” Moderated by guitar notes that soar in ebbing and flowing waves, Sinful Nature advocates for spiritual and bodily liberation. “Let’s get loaded / And make some strange things come through.”
However, these two songs are the exception. With most songs barely distinguishable from one another, “I Love You, It’s Cool” flows easily from song to song but altogether makes for a tedious and forgettable listen. The album provides a set of intoxicating atmospheres, but consists of far too many fillers that lack substance. Hopefully, this album will simply be filler between “Beast Rest Forth Mouth” and a more innovative, ambitious work in the future.

“My musical journey thus far has been shaped by an intertwined love of classical and jazz music,” pianist Kirill Gerstein’s program notes began. On Friday night at the Berklee Performance Center, Gerstein proved his virtuosity as well as his ability to artfully conjoin the two genres. In a performance that was declared by many of the musicians to be a tribute to their alma mater, the Berklee College of Music, Gerstein, clarinetist Anat Cohen, and several Berklee faculty members put together an animated if incohesive program that included two world premieres and a stunning rendition of “Rhapsody in Blue.”
Gerstein opened the concert alone, playing four pieces by George Gershwin and György Ligeti attacca, as if each piece were a movement in a larger work. His decision to start with three slow pieces, two Ligeti Études and Gershwin’s “Somebody Loves Me,” resulted in an initial lethargy, but he ignited the audience with a fiery rendition of “I Got Rhythm,” ending the piece by pressing his entire forearm against the piano keys. This introductory segment gave Gerstein a chance to show off the full range of his abilities, from blossoming, jazzy melodies to flashy ostinato fingerwork.
The second star of the night was acclaimed jazz clarinetist Anat Cohen. In her set, she played three Afro-Latin tunes over a full jazz orchestra. As Cohen explained during the concert, the three pieces came from distinct cultures in Cape Verde, Brazil, and Cuba, and each gave her the opportunity to show off her versatility and verve. Her low register was sultry and captivating, but Cohen shone the most in her uppermost altissimo range. She was able to wail over the band while maintaining an rich tone as she soared through the climatic moments in Pixinguinha’s “Ingênuo.” Her glissandos and pitch bends showed taste instead of gaudiness.
Perhaps most impressive in Cohen’s playing was her stage presence. Her facial expressions were as expressive as the music itself, and even when she wasn’t playing, she danced along to the music, shuffling her feet in a rumba.
Equally captivating as Cohen’s command of the stage were the improvised solos that peppered the performance, during which even the usually serious Gerstein cracked a smile. Faculty member and jazz innovator Gary Burton took the stage for the premiere of Chick Corea’s “The Visitors,” and his vibraphone solo was astoundingly fast and showy. As he traded solos with Gerstein, the onstage chemistry reached a high point for the night.
By the time the performers got to the closing headliner piece, Gershwin’s ubiquitous “Rhapsody in Blue,” the audience was expecting something jaw-dropping—and Cohen’s opening clarinet wail immediately met expectations. As Gerstein ripped through famous riffs alongside Cohen’s captivating solos, “Rhapsody in Blue” was clearly the perfect piece to end the night. The strong and bright brass section provided a steady backdrop for Gerstein’s flourishes. The piece was also played at a faster tempo than usual, which was startling at first but eventually lent a sense of drive and excitement.
At times, however, the performance dragged. The show was 11 pieces and almost two-and-a-half hours long, and the set list certainly could have been condensed or more united under a common theme. Some of the selections veered too heavily into standard jazz or Latin to effectively set up “Rhapsody.” And Cohen’s section, though fun, was separate thematically and atmospherically from the rest of the concert.
However, these faults were more a sign of overambition than sloppy planning, and this collaboration between Berklee College of Music alumni, faculty, and students was ultimately a success. It’s hard to tell whether Gershwin, who was inspired to write “Rhapsody in Blue” on a train ride to Boston, was thinking about this city when he wrote what he deemed a “musical kaleidoscope of America.” Through his energetic performance, Gerstein not only paid tribute to the Berklee College of Music but to the pulsing city itself.

Some band names paint a grossly inaccurate description of the band’s musical style—Cute Is What We Aim For and Hoobastank immediately come to mind. Rocket Juice & the Moon, in contrast, provides a dead ringer for the band’s sound, which can best be described as a marriage of space rock and juicy rap overseen in the chapel of electronic funk. The band members—established legends Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz, bassist Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and drummer Tony Allen from Fela Kuti’s afrobeat band Africa ’70—each make use of their specific expertise to create a wholly new musical space. The eponymous debut—which features Erykah Badu as well as many African musicians who play in various genres—is an innovative and educational experience that takes the listener through a re-interpretation of rap, rock, funk, and afrobeat.
Listeners who expect the sharp rock melodies of Blur or the pounding anthems of the Red Hot Chili Peppers may be confused or disappointed. Afrobeat textures and percussive lines dominate the arrangement, and Albarn and Flea only seem to be providing tight accompaniment to the musical concept. In addition, Allen’s dense rhythmic patterns give the album a potentially jarring foreignness to mainstream listeners. However, Albarn’s and Flea’s rock origins are not entirely abandoned. Flea brings his trademark aggressive slapping style to form a steady rhythmic foundation for Albarn’s guitar melodies in songs like “There.” Moreover, electronic effects, like the heavily-distorted phone ringing and synthesized outbursts in “Extinguished,” add another stylistic dimension that makes the album much more than a mere afrobeat-heavy rock experiment.
While the band’s instrumentation alone—a drum kit, electronic synths, bass, electric guitar, horns, and vocals—is indicative of the musicians’ rock and funk backgrounds, the album is particularly refreshing due to its unorthodox rhythmic patterns. The album joins complex, stuttering rhythms with non-traditional melodies. “Chop Up,” for example, takes minimal primary and background vocals, 16th note syncopation à la afrobeat on a standard kit, and dancing melodic lines in the electric guitar to create a driving result entirely unexpected given its constituent parts. On “The Unfadable,” Allen lays down a simple shuffling beat that Albarn’s synths actively redefine by creating a conflicting rhythm of their own.
The vocals are as diverse as the album’s stylistic influences. The melodic lines on the album are not so interesting for their lyrics so much as their vocal techniques. These include melisma—when the voice changes tones on a single word—and syllabic percussion, which lends the songs much more sophistication than poetic delivery alone. Instrumentally-based songs like “There” use the latter technique in the back-up vocals to support its harmony and texture. However the voice is also used in a more familar manner: several songs, such as “Dam(n)” and “Poison,” feature rap that make use of lyricism in deliberate, imagery-filled poetry reminiscent of Common: “I painted the sky red, until the raindrops bled / Now Heaven whispers words I never said.” This intelligent use of the voice, as alternatively instrumental and lyrical, is but one factor that elevates Rocket Juice & the Moon’s stylistic experiment above categorization of simply a jazz or rock concept album.
Despite all of its wanderings and international influence, Rocket Juice & the Moon doesn’t sound overly foreign. Many Americans are more than familiar with the album’s different parts, including hip-hop, electronica, and funk, and Rocket Juice & the Moon provides a compositional learning experience in the blending of popular, though seldom crossed, styles. Two steps beyond Kid Cudi in creating a spacey, psychedelic rap/funk mix, Rocket Juice & the Moon uses heavily-distorted electronic pads and effects in conjunction with the more traditional instrumentation and does not simply depend on the novelty of space-age synths alone. The electronics are used not in a gimmicky sense, but rather to enhance and set apart already successful base material. There is often much rewarding about trying new things, especially when they prove not to be as foreign as first anticipated. Rocket Juice & the Moon serves as a perfect example.

College us just a place to escape your prospective husband, at least in the world of W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan 1884 operetta  “Princess Ida, or Castle Adamant.” The Victorian piece ridicules the importance of women’s education, so the Agassiz Theatre in Radcliffe Yard was a perfectly ironic choice of venue. The Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ production of “Princess Ida”—which ran from March 22 to April 1 and was directed by Eli E. Kahn ’13 and Michael R. Taylor ’14—played up the humor in the rather politically incorrect plot. The show took a look at the libretto’s uncomfortable theme by emphasizing the incongruity—through commendable acting and set design—between the characters’ outdated Victorian sentiments and the supposedly futuristic setting.
Princess Ida (Marit A. Medefind ’12) has been betrothed to Prince Hilarion (Joey Goodknight) since she was one. Before she comes of age, the princess forswears men and founds a women’s college at one of her father’s country houses, Castle Adamant. Hilarion attempts to woo Ida by disguising himself as a student at the college.
In this production, the Victorian drama was set on Mars. The excellently crafted stage was co-designed by Ethan R. Pierce ’14 and Lorin Gu ’15. Their interpretation of Castle Adamant consisted of a fortress-shaped geometric garden whose walls were covered with painted cubes. When the lights were dimmed the squares seemed to stand out of the façade as if they were three-dimentional objects as opposed to flat images. This effect enhanced the sci-fi aesthetic of the world the characters inhabited.
The ingenious decision to set the story on Mars evoked several cinematic images that complemented the themes of the show. The first is the aesthetic of 1950s sci-fi B movies, in which buxom actresses reprised the role of damsels in distress. This mid-century Hollywood trope is comparable to the social mores of the late Victorian era. Traditionalists in the 1880s were reacting to the newfangled women’s movement just like conservatives in the 1950s were trying to recreate traditional gender roles after Rosie the Riveter went to work during World War Two.
Gilbert and Sullivan’s controversial take on female education would no doubt displease most modern women, but much of the chauvinism in the show was satirical. The kooky setting added to the flippant character of the production and helped create a sense of over-the-top humor to mitigate the operetta’s offensive plot. Ida’s three bumbling and bellicose brothers (Luke D. Burkhart ’14, Jonathan N. Alvarez-Gutierrez ’14, and Mike A. Yashinsky ’11) were similar to the giant robots found in B movies from the 1950s. For example in the song “We Are Warriors Three,” the trio hilariously played up the juxtaposition between their futuristic armor and their clunky, awkward movements.
Fantastic life on other planets was a common trope in popular culture at the dawn of the 20th century. Depictions of the moon—such as the one found in Méliès’ silent film “A Trip to the Moon”—included over-the-top sets populated by strange creatures. The jerkily moving actors in this classic are wonderfully self-aware and even sheepish. The actors in “Ida” mimicked this visual style to great effect. Ben T. Morris ’09 shone as Ida’s father, the misanthropic and crippled King Gama, by combining Shakespearean wit with fantastically odd movements reminicient of the creatures found in Méliès’ classic. His actions were  rigid and awkward, but in so doing he provided a brilliant caricature of the sort of acting  representative of earlier films. This sense of visuality dovetailed well with the tongue-in-cheek camp of the operetta and helped mitigate the sexist themes with its humor.
Another image called to mind by the Mars setting was that of Charlton Heston’s classic 1968 film, “Planet of the Apes,” which was very fitting given the profusion of ape imagery in Gilbert’s libretto. In one of the most enjoyable numbers, “A Lady Fair of Lineage High,” the Princess condemned men for their baser instincts, saying, “Man, sprung from ape, is ape at heart.” Gilbert’s text uses this trope to poke fun at the entire male gender. “Darwinian man,” Ida sings, “though well-behaved / At best is only a monkey shaved.” Seeing Medefind’s excellently acted scorn while Goodknight tried to woo her in “Oh, Joy!—Our Chief Is Saved,” one almost expected to hear her speak Heston’s famous line from the his film: “Take your stinking paws off of me, you damn dirty ape!”
The ultimate moral of “Ida” was the outdated message that marriage brings harmony in the war of the sexes, but the playful approach of the G&S Players made the show too entertaining to condemn.

Nicki Minaj is sex. The diva-cum-rapper’s performances are routine—predictable beats, generally unimaginative lyrics, and trite themes of cockiness and sexuality—but she derives her success from the way in which she goes through the motions. With her incredible vocal-tone variation, sense of rhythm, and use of space, Minaj lends the ordinary a patent kinkiness.
In her sophomore album, “Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,” Minaj taps into this prowess. While her lyrics are generally predictable and underwhelming, the album succeeds when Minaj does what she does best—being weird. However, when she shies away from her persona and turns to mainstream formulas, Minaj loses her shock factor and unique vocal delivery. Moreover, her songs’ lack of substance becomes apparent. Unfortunately, Minaj is far too normal for too much of the album. “Roman Reloaded” gives us only a fading taste of Minaj’s powerful quirkiness while we are barraged with poorly sung and produced mainstream rap.
On the album, Minaj often combines singsong vocals with crass lyrics to hilarious, ironic effect. “I am your leader, yes I am your leader / You’re not a believer, suck a big dick,” sings Minaj on the album’s third track, “I Am Your Leader,” her voice mechanical and staccato, perfectly matched to her in-your-face message. While repeated lines like “Put my dick in yo face” from “Come on a Cone” could easily fall flat, they are an entertaining break when Minaj sings them in an R&B diva vibrato.
Minaj’s attention to the importance of tone comes across even more strongly on the album’s opener, “Roman Holiday.” “My flows is sick and I’m a lunatic / And this can’t be cured with no elixa,” she raps, sighing out the last syllable of each line of the verse with a definitive “ha.” Between these emphases and the ridiculous fake British accent Minaj puts on when singing the hook—a refrain about how her alter ego should take medication and fix himself—it’s hard to shake the feeling that she’s mocking the listener and the unhelpful, overbearing voice of society’s authorities.
Within just this song, Minaj slides through several vocal registers and tones, creating the feeling of multiple speakers to match her self-professed multiple personalities. She expertly creates variation without losing the precision of her tone. The fourth track, “Beez in the Trap,” affords Minaj ample space for her vocal play. It opens with echoing, rhythmic pitches backed by a stuttering kick, and snaps instead of snare hits. The synth sticks to low bass tones, leaving Minaj with the entire middle to fill. On the bridge, she draws out her words in a way that sharply contrasts with her crisp delivery on the hook and verses. She’s whispery, casual, and indifferent. “Damn, damn, what they say about me? / I don’t know man, fuck is on your biscuit? If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch / I don’t know man, I’m shittin’ on your whole life,” she sings, transforming an otherwise uninteresting, even nonsensical passage into one of the better moments of the album.
When the album tries for sentimentality and mainstream pop, however, it flops. Tracks like “Champion” hint at Minaj’s potential, with lines like “This is that run-and-get-a-dollar-for-the-ice-cream-cone / ‘cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas / But my memories only happy images / This is for the hood, this is for the kids.” However the chorus about being a champion is tired and formulaic. Similarly, songs like “Beautiful Sinner” and “Young Forever” fall outside Minaj’s skill set by leaning on sung lines that are blandly delivered. Such simplistic mistakes abound throughout the second half of the album.
Minaj redeems herself on the album’s closer. “Stupid hoes is my enemy / Stupid hoes is so whack / Stupid hoes shoulda befriended me / And she coulda probably came back,” sings Minaj in a twisted childish voice on the already released “Stupid Hoe.” While here Minaj returns to her strengths for a powerfully bizarre finish, she would have done well to heed her own advice—had she paid attention to herself throughout the album and focused on her own quirky vocal abilities rather than conforming to conventional production and lyrical themes, she would have come back on her sophomore album much more strong.

After NATO bombed Serbia in 1999 to end the bloody Kosovo conflict, filmmaker Jeff Silva, the first U.S. civilian to be allowed entry to the country after the bombings, travelled through the region to document the aftermath. Silva, formerly a teaching fellow in Visual and Environmental Studies, wove together his experiences in an ethnographic documentary called “Balkan Rhapsodies: 78 Measures of War,” a series of abstract vignettes exploring the war’s devastating repercussions and its inhabitants’ efforts to rebuild their lives.
At an expatriate-hub bar in Kosovo, he met a lifelong friend, Ivan, who became the subject of Silva’s latest documentary, “Ivan & Ivana.” The film documents Ivan and his wife Ivana’s life in America after they fled the war-torn Kosovo. The documentary screened Saturday at the Harvard Film Archive.
The Harvard Crimson: What are the main themes in your body of work?
JS: Well, I have a background in anthropology, so I’ve always been interested in culture…. I really took a keen interest in how to represent the lives of other people…. I’m really engaged as an artist in what’s happening in the world. Conflicts have been an area of interest for me. I spent more than a decade investigating the history and culture of the Balkan region, but I’m equally interested in conflict all around the world and also our government’s relationship to [such conflicts], so I’m pushing my role as an artist to critically assess my country’s actions as well.
THC: What was it that most struck you in your experiences in the Balkan region?
JS: Growing up in the United States prior to September 11, the thought of being involved in a conflict area and being involved a war zone and seeing human suffering on a large scale was something that you’re sheltered from…. Going [to the Balkans] as a citizen from a country that just engaged in the bombing of the other country was a scary prospect.... I didn’t have a plan; I didn’t know anyone. I knew I was going there to film and to bear witness…[to] talk to people and to try to add something to the dialogue of what was happening in Serbia at the time, during the Milosevic regime. I was touched by the generosity of the people that I met—by their intelligence, by how articulate they were, by how compassionate they were. I was saddened by how lucky I was in some ways and how I could just go there and leave, and they were imprisoned there.
THC: What was your relationship like with the people you filmed in the region? Would they come to you?
JS: It happened through a very organic, loose network. People heard that there was some crazy American in Belgrade, and a friend would say, “Hey, I’ve got this guy staying at my house, and he’d love to talk to you and meet you,” and people would just come over to my friend Zoran’s house and hang out until four in the morning, drink lots of šljivovica…. I branched out from there…. I would interview someone who I thought had some important role. I was interested in regular people, too, because everyone was affected.
THC: Do you want “Ivan & Ivana” to convey a social commentary, or is it more about telling an interesting narrative?
JS: I hope that it’s more than just a narrative, just entertainment. I want you to be engaged in the film in the sense that a film lures you in and you’re captivated by it, and so that’s important to me. There’s a lot of subtext in the film. It doesn’t overtly politicize a lot. It just captures time and things that happen, like the economic crisis, housing crisis, and the relationship of these people to America. It raises issues about immigration, it raises issues about the American dream…about our capitalist society hell-bent just on consuming and making money. But it’s not a social-issue documentary that has a voice-over and tells you what to think about these things. You have to make those decisions on your own.
THC: What was your best experience teaching film at Harvard?
JS: The best thing was seeing non-artists who were highly intelligent, academically driven Harvard students unable to figure out how to express themselves creatively at the beginning, and then by the end of the year they could. That was the highlight, because I think it doesn’t come naturally for Harvard students to deal with [the] ambiguities of creative work.

Ask most art aficionados about Lyonel Feininger, and they’ll tell you of his vibrant cubist paintings. But the German-American artist also left behind thousands of negatives and photographs, some of which are now being showcased in “Lyonel Feininger: Photographs, 1928-1939,” a new exhibit at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum that opened March 30 and runs until June 2. Drawn from Harvard’s large collection of Feininger’s work, this exhibit explores an artist’s experiments with an emerging medium of expression for which his love is often overlooked.
Although already in his 50s, Feininger became fascinated by the new medium of photography while working in the 1920s at Germany’s famous Bauhaus school, an institute dedicated to modern art. Though his paintings were already well known at the time, Feininger did not expect his photographs to be placed on display. “Feininger never had any intention for these photos to be seen on exhibition. This was purely for himself, his own private form of therapy that helped him deal with the changing world around him,” said Laura L. Muir, assistant curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum and the curator of this exhibit.
The photos in the exhibit reveal Feininger’s preoccupation with light and shadow. He found light more difficult to express in painting, but photography allowed him to better capture its shades and contrasts. He frequently photographed at night to accentuate the illumination coming from street lamps, small lights, or fires. The exhibit includes eerie, lamplit views of the Bauhaus building at night, which Muir said reflected Feininger’s feelings of estrangement from the activities of the school. “They convey the growing sense of discomfort he felt, like being a fish out of water,” Muir said.
Feininger also explored more avant-garde methods of photo manipulation. “He often used negatives to turn night into day and light into darkness,” Muir said. The exhibit includes his experiments with double exposure, a technique wherein two different images are superimposed in one photograph.
The exhibition features Feininger works from 1928 to 1939, during which time the artist lived in Germany until increasing Nazi scrutiny pressed him to resettle in New York in 1937. He produced a series of bizarre images of mannequins’ reflections in 1932 and 1933, after a Nazi majority voted to close the Bauhaus in its home city of Dessau, but he took lighter shots—some with his new 35mm Leica camera—of his travels in Europe. In 1931, he visited Parisian neighborhoods where he had lived 25 years earlier, and Muir says his photographs of Paris were influenced by a sense of revisiting his past. “Rather than photographing the Tuileries or the Eiffel Tower, Feininger chose to focus on narrow streets and alleys. He often focused on destroyed buildings and ruins.”
Apart from the museum’s selection, Muir explained, thousands of undisplayed negatives and slides sit in storage in archives at Harvard. “This is only the tip of the iceberg,” Muir said. “Hopefully a student will be inspired to do some digging around in Harvard’s archives.”
Harvard possesses the world’s largest collection of Feininger’s work—paintings as well as photographs and negatives— which is held in the Houghton Library and the Busch-Reisinger Museum’s Lyonel Feininger Archive. To construct this exhibit, Muir sifted through the thousands of negatives in Harvard’s possession and tried to organize the photographs to tell a particular story. “Being a curator is often like being a detective,” she said. “There are often 30 copies of a given photograph. Selecting which photographs to include and how to group them together to tell a story was very difficult but very rewarding.”
Muir explained that a large part of her process involved speaking to the artist’s late son, T. Lux Feininger, a world-renowned photographer in his own right. “The most amazing thing was getting to speak with T. Lux...[about] what it was like to live with his father as he was learning to take these photographs. His wife, Julia, was much less supportive of his photography. She thought it was a waste of time,” Muir said.
Leslie A. Morris, curator of modern books and manuscripts at the Houghton Library, hopes the exhibit will raise recognition of Feininger’s works and of the Houghton’s expansive collection. “I hope, in particular, that Harvard students and faculty will come to the exhibition and say, ‘Wow, I didn’t know anything like this was here,’” Morris said. “I hope it will inspire students to explore the library and museum catalogues and websites to discover other things they didn’t know about.”
Thomas W. Lentz, the Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums, explained that being connected to Harvard’s vast collection of Feininger’s work creates a responsibility both to the public and to Feininger of sharing that work with the world. “We sit on this enormous archive of his work, and we want people to know about that collection. We want people to understand why he was important,” Lentz said. The exhibit also features some of Feininger’s other experiments—works with watercolors, sketchings, and prints—from Harvard’s collection. “He was much more multi-dimensional than what people give him credit for,” Lentz said. “We have a responsibility to make people understand that.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 11
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that artist Lyonel Feininger produced a series of double-exposure works in 1932 and 1933. Although Feininger experimented with the technique of double exposure later in life, that series was in fact a set of images of mannequins’ reflections.

Brendan M. Cooney, the composer behind the film scoring project Not-So-Silent Cinema, peeked up at his audience at the beginning of his Friday show at Somerville’s Center for Arts at the Armory. “I’ll do more yakking after the film—let’s just get into things,” he said, seated behind his piano. “You can meet the band later.”
The screen hanging above Cooney and the rest of his band flickered into a black and white shot of Buster Keaton slouching across a road. The band, composed of Cooney on piano, Andy L. Bergman on clarinet, and Kyle Tuttle on banjo, burst into an original score written by Cooney to accompany the first of three Keaton short films. As Keaton unfolded a newspaper as large as a blanket, tripped over his own feet, wooed a large-eyed lady, and was hired by and then escaped from a murderous gang of ruffians, Cooney and his bandmates met him step for step with an up-tempo Americana score. Cooney said he intends his scores to play up the brilliance of these old films without overpowering them and to slide the audience back in time for a night of early cinema.
After a rehearsal in his Medford home, Cooney sat perched behind his piano, sipping whiskey with his bandmates as he explained how he became involved with silent films. He recently founded Not-So-Silent Cinema, he said, but his first project was several years back, in Philadelphia, when he decided to score Sergei Eisenstein’s 1925 silent film “Battleship Potemkin.” The audience’s reaction was a pleasant surprise for Cooney. “They fucking loved it,” he said.
He studied music at Oberlin College, where, he said, he always had an audience of music students who appreciated esoteric compositions. “I can play all this obscure, obtuse, hip shit… [but] audiences want something they can hold on to, something they can understand, something palatable,” he said.
For Cooney, films provide an anchor for his compositions and make them more accessible to audiences. “We live in such a visual culture. We’re always watching TV, we’re always on the internet—when there’s a moving image to latch onto, music is so much easier to understand,” he said. His scene-by-scene composition process relied on having the Keaton films on hand, he explained. “I set this computer on my piano, take out a big piece of manuscript paper, pour a glass of whiskey, and hit ‘play,’” he said. As part of Not-So-Silent Cinema, he has also composed scores for films such as “The Mark of Zorro” and the 1922 vampire classic “Nosferatu.”
Cooney strives to create a sound built from instruments and genres that are not usually paired with one another, a philosophy that led him to bring together his musicians for the Keaton scores. “The goal is to try and find people that would normally never play together, because that’s when you get the most interesting interactions. You know, bluegrass banjo, jazz piano—hardly ever happens. And then adding clarinet on top of that—totally hip,” he said. “These are my three favorite instruments in the world right now, and I was really hoping to find a film that made sense with them.”
Cooney felt the trio of instruments evoked America of the 1920s, which is why he chose the three Buster Keaton shorts— “One Week,” from 1920; “The High Sign,” from 1921; and “The Goat,” also from 1921. The dusty American West imagery of Keaton’s short works delight Cooney, and he and the band aim to draw out the spirit and landscape of Keaton’s films. “The focus is not really the music,” Tuttle said.
The three musicians agree that Buster Keaton is the true powerhouse in their performance. “You need to get your ego out of the way, let the film be the star,” Bergman said. “These movies had no original score, so the movie just had to be able to support itself with the humor…. I mean, you can add to it, but this movie is just like, ‘I’m funny—watch me!’”
As the three rehearsed before their performance, they marveled at Keaton’s skill. At one point, Cooney played a clip of Keaton sliding like a human Slinky over the top of a boxcar back and forth several times, crying, “See that? How does he do that?”
The band seemed just as relaxed onstage at the Armory as in its casual rehearsals at Cooney’s home. The musicians’ appreciation for the films they score was apparent as they grinned and chuckled throughout the performance. As the first short concluded and the audience burst into applause and hoots, Cooney leaned into the microphone and said simply, “Thank you, Buster Keaton.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first installment of this year’s Norton lecture series, South-African artist William Kentridge described the experience of an 8 year-old standing on a beach watching his shadow lengthen. “The shadows are a version of you,” said Kentridge to his audience in Sanders Theater. “You lift your arm, and the shadow lifts its arm. You step forward, and the shadow steps forward...I am its controller, but also delighted and amazed at the speed and dexterity I didn’t know I had. It’s an extension of me, and it’s more than an extension of me.”
Kentridge’s description of the child and its shadow in the lecture, which is titled, “Drawing Lesson One: In Praise of Shadows,” illustrates the complexity with which each individual inhabits his or her visual surroundings. It also serves as a point of departure for Kentridge’s larger project: to identify the strategies and discoveries of visual artists as a valuable form of knowledge that is applicable outside the sphere of art practice and art history. “It is in the very limitations and leanness of shadows that we learn,” Kentridge remarked. “We complete the illusion and, recognizing ourselves completing it, become aware of that activity.”
The artist’s choice to term his lectures “Drawing Lessons” serves to assert the primacy of non-linear, image-based thinking, both within his practice and the lectures themselves. “They’re called drawing lessons because they’re not drawing lessons,” Kentridge said in an interview. “They’re talking about all the ideas which are there before drawing happens.... They’re also called drawing lessons to state that I’m speaking as an artist, not as scholar.”
Kentridge’s desire to approach the scholarly feat of the Norton Lectures as an artist is in many ways not only the goal, but also the subject of each lecture. While he articulates his studio practice in terms that are broadly accessible, his primary concern is not to demystify artistic process, but instead to argue in support of its ambiguities.
CREATIVE CAUCUS
Kentridge is the 2011-2012 recipient of the Charles Eliot Norton Professorship of Poetry, an annual lectureship designed to honor innovation across artistic disciplines. C.C. Stillman, who endowed the chair in 1926, stipulated that, “in the administration of this gift, the term Poetry shall be interpreted in the broadest sense, including together with Verse, all poetic expression in Language, Music, or the Fine Arts.” In agreement with Stillman’s request, the task of nominating candidates cycles through Harvard’s departments, with committee members drawn from the music, art, and literature faculties in alternate years. This year’s selection panel consisted primarily of professors in the History of Art and Architecture and Visual & Environmental Studies departments.
Homi K. Bhabha, Anne F. Rothberg professor of the Humanities, Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, and a member of this year’s selection committee, says that the assembled members looked for candidates engaged in either art scholarship or art practice before considering those who bridged the two fields. “We looked at a category of practicing artists who were also interested in the history of art...artists who had careers as writers and thinkers, placing their artwork within more general intellectual problems,” Bhaba says. “And very quickly, William Kentridge came to the top.”
Maria Gough, Joseph Pulitzer professor of Modern Art and also a selection committee member, pointed to the rare combination of attributes and interests that the committee sought in its candidates. “Of the many reasons why the committee invited Kentridge, one of the most important is that he is an artist with a tremendous facility for communicating with a wide range of people in the Harvard community and beyond it,” Gough says. “[Kentridge’s] work is involved with the traditional medium of drawing, but always in tandem with moving image media and performance; it is also involved with fundamental problems like the history of colonialism, and it seriously engages with the history of art.”
While the broad political and intellectual scope of Kentridge’s art may initially have brought him to the committee’s attention, both Bhabha and Gough emphasize that wide-ranging appeal was a secondary consideration to the quality of the artist’s work. “We are thinking about somebody who responds to the world in his or her work,” Bhabha says. “The primary condition is really the interest of the work itself.”
MOVING PICTURES
Kentridge’s creative output spans a variety of media including drawing, animation, film, set-design, installation and performance. Yet, he terms his lectures “Drawing Lessons.”
“[Kentridge] is using the concept of drawing in an expanded sense. By the late 20th century, the very notion of drawing had been expanded almost beyond recognition,” says Gough. His past Norton lectures have made great use of his paper work; the first work discussed was “Shadow Procession,” a stop-motion animation of cut-paper silhouettes. In the second lecture, entitled “A Brief History of Colonialism,” Kentridge introduced a variety of paper maquettes—small-scale models—and puppet theaters constructed in connection with the production he directed of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute.”
In the third “Drawing Lesson,” entitled “Vertical Thinking: Johannesburg Biography,” Kentridge will introduce the work for which he is arguably best known, which he refers as “Drawings for Projection.” These works were created using his signature variation on stop-motion technique, which involves repeatedly altering and rephotographing a charcoal drawing so that the images, when sequenced, create the illusion of motion and time passing. In “9 Drawings for Projection,” a series of short films completed in 2003, Kentridge examines post-apartheid Johannesberg through the lens of three characters: Soho Eckstein, the merciless industrialist, Mrs. Eckstein, his neglected wife, and Felix Teitlebaum, the romantic soul who becomes Mrs. Eckstein’s lover.  These haunting, meticulously crafted narratives garnered Kentridge international acclaim for his innovative use of erasure as animation.
Kentridge’s decision to locate his work in between the genres of drawing and film has provoked its share of critical confusion. In her article “The Rock: William Kentridge’s Drawings for Projection,” art historian Rosalind E. Krauss explains that Kentridge sees his filmic process as a “derivative of drawing,” which for him necessitates that the animations be displayed alongside their constitutive drawings in museums and galleries, as opposed to conventional theaters. Krauss writes that this mode of presentation “has annoyed certain commentators who...otherwise admiring Kentridge’s work, don’t see why he shouldn’t just show them as animation films, entering them into the space of cinema.”\
Other viewers do not recognize any further need to articulate Kentridge’s unique method of production. “It may be helpful to ask in certain contexts, you know, what are you really? But in the moment of making something that seems like the least important question,” says Peter L. Galison, Joseph Pellegrino University professor and Kentridge’s long-term collaborator. “I think sometimes work functions in several registers, and that’s not something to apologize for, but something to aspire to.”Kentridge, maintaining that “the work must make it’s own way in the world,” does not consider the classification of his art to be of pressing importance. However, he suggests that the process of generating his charcoal-based animations more closely resembles drawing than filmmaking. “The strategies of making the work are the strategies of making a drawing more than they are the traditional strategies of making a film,” Kentridge said in an interview. “Film has always been a large social undertaking with a studio and many people involved, and the animated films are an attempt to make a film which you can make on your own time, with indecision, with uncertainty.”
LASTING TRACES
The uncertainty and indecision Kentridge describes may reflect the difficulty of representing his films’ grim subject-matter: the aftermath of apartheid, which he likens to an “immovable rock.” “The scale and weight with which this rock presents itself is inimical to that task [of representation,]” Kentridge wrote in 1990 of the apartheid. Despite the formidable task of depicting these atrocities, he maintains that the artist’s studio can serve as a retreat in which to represent and work through the memory of the past.
In his second lecture, Kentridge suggested a link between the challenge of representing tragedy and his concept of the universal archive. He proposed that the lingering images of every event to have occurred on earth are preserved and projected into space in the form of photons moving at the speed of light. Though the photons travel further away from earth, these images of human history may still be visible to a well-positioned observer. “The universe is a collection of images.... We are transmitting stations broadcasting ourselves the whole time,” Kentridge said. “Once launched, the image cannot be called back.”
The concept of projected images that are not fleeting but lingering in three-dimensional space relates to the technique behind Kentridge’s drawings for projection. The material build-up resulting from the artist’s repeated alteration and erasure of charcoal marks parallels the accumulation of events in the universal archive. Without explicitly engaging the specific political figures and events of post-apartheid South Africa, Kentridge’s suggestive layering of marks reflects the ever-present memory of “the rock,” even as it resists direct representation.
“NECESSARY STUPIDITY”
Kentridge has several times punctuated his lectures with variations on the phrase, “And now, we must return to the studio.” For Kentridge, the studio is the site of what he describes as a “full frontal assault” of multiple processes and ideas in which an artist may be engaged simultaneously. The non-verbal discoveries resulting from this multiform engagement can be difficult to translate from the workspace to the lecture hall. To illustrate this conflict, Kentridge projected four identically dressed images of himself which—as the real Kentridge paused in his delivery—continued to pace forward and backward on the screen overhead, reciting various thoughts and phrases from lecture notes to create an unintelligible, overlapping chorus.
According to Kentridge, an artist’s ability to operate on multiple fronts at once depends on his or her cultivation of ”necessary stupidity.” “The necessary stupidity refers to the activities which you can’t really explain in a rational way,” Kentridge said in an interview. “As soon as you start to explain them rationally, they are extremely foolish and don’t have a logical sense, but nonetheless are extremely important.” Though Kentridge does not elaborate on the exact nature of these activities, he associates them with an abandonment of linear thinking for an emphasis on observation and material exploration.
Kentridge’s commitment to asserting the primacy of this concept in the Norton lectures to an audience awaiting the display of brilliance is one of the drawing lessons’ greatest points of tension and interest. His promotion of this concept subtly critiques the privileged status of the more traditional, scholarly forms of knowledge in which much of Harvard’s community is engaged.
“His argument is that artistic practice is a form of knowledge production...and shouldn’t be viewed simply as a form of supplement or afterthought that takes place once the important work of, say, philosophy, or some other discipline has been done,” Gough says. “This was not a lecture solely for the art world or the art-history crowd....This was a lecture for a university with a complicated but potentially dynamic relationship to the advanced forms of experimental aesthetic practice.”
Bhabha suggests that though Kentridge may be critiquing the limitations of the lecture format, he works within it to present images on their own terms. “I would argue it was not only about art as knowledge production, but knowledge as art production at the same time,” Bhabha says of Kentridge’s first lecture. “He changed the lecture format because the visual materials he showed were not simply illustrations of something he had said. They had their own narrative which converged with the lecture.”
Kentridge suggests that privileging images over text naturally occurs in the delivery of an artist talk, but that it also reflects his conviction in the primacy of visual knowledge. “Argument and logic [are] something on top of the world, hovering over it, but not a part of it,” said Kentridge in his first lecture, describing his disillusionment early in life and the reason for turning to the “limitations and leanness of shadows” as legitimate sources of knowledge.
“If you’re artist and not a scholar then obviously your life has been not about words, but about images,” Kentridge said in an interview. “So to defend that activity of making meaning through practical activity, which is what artists do, is to show that there can’t always be a privilege of rational, word based thinking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a university with a reputation for vibrant academic discourse that is frequently host to a diverse array of events, it would seem to odd to single out Harvard as a violator of free speech. Nevertheless, perhaps because of Harvard’s renown, campus events that would not receive the same scrutiny elsewhere draw the media and the public eye. For example, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education recently included Harvard in its ranking of the twelve worst colleges and universities for freedom of speech. An article in the Huffington Post written by Greg Lukianoff, President of FIRE, elaborated on the ranking, in which Harvard was listed as the fourth worst campus for civil liberties. Quite how FIRE arrived at its ranking seems likely to remain obscure. In Lukianoff’s post, the “Freshman Pledge”, the Harvard faculty’s pressure on Subramanian Swamy, and Harvard’s alleged censoring of Yale students’ right to use images of Mark Zuckerberg and others were all listed as factors behind the University’s high place in this particular shame list. True, Harvard’s record of protecting free speech is not perfect, but admonishing Harvard’s administration for seriously violating this all-important principle is unwarranted. If a threat to freedom of speech exists on campus, it comes less from the strong arm of the President’s office, and more from the mentality, enthusiasm, and self-censorship of students themselves.
Upon quick inspection, the allegations levied by FIRE appear too insubstantial to make the claim that Harvard does not respect the rights and values of its students. Take, for example, the pressure to make freshmen sign the “Freshman Pledge,” a symbolic and largely insignificant, albeit irritating, addition to the first-year routine. The “effective dismissal” of summer school instructor Subramanian Swamy, meanwhile, was brought about by faculty members—not administration officials—and attempted to curtail what they thought was hate speech, including Swamy’s call for the destruction of mosques in India. Preventing Yale students at the Harvard-Yale football game from designing t-shirts with the names of well-known dropouts like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates also seems closer to a legal technicality than a violation of free speech that should merit the University a “worst colleges for free speech in 2012” badge.
For the most part, Harvard explicitly encourages vibrant, and diverse opinions on and off campus. To give just one just one recent example, Harvard withstood widespread criticism to allow the One-State Conference to go forward at the Kennedy School. While the conference served as a forum for controversial and unhelpful solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to have banned the conference or applied pressure for it to be cancelled would, as we argued, have been detrimental to freedom of speech on campus. Last semester, Harvard also notably allowed protesters to pitch a tent city in the Yard as part of the larger Occupy movement. While the administration did in some ways crack down on Occupy Harvard, it still allowed the overall free expression of a message and ideas that were in large part hostile to many recent Harvard policies. The treatment of both these events and countless others amounts to an attempt to permit and indeed foster open expression, not stifle freedom of thought.
Harvard’s student body, on the other hand, does not take full advantage of the opportunities afforded to it by this firm commitment to freedom of speech. Harvard, clearly, is far removed from the times of April 9, 1969, when 300 students stormed University Hall at a time that Crimson writers have since declared an “era marked by protest and student activism.” Even compared to other campuses today, Harvard’s culture simply does not lend itself to creating the levels of concerted protests seen recently at Berkeley and University of California Davis. Individuals who attempt to make the most out of their right to free expression are often met with the laconic and skeptical reservation of their peers. Sometimes, this reaction borders on opposition and even intrusion on the rights of others. For example, pro-life groups have had their posters torn down in the past. Many students reacted with hostility and resentment toward the Occupy movement, reportedly even going so far as to defile protesters’ tents. The inclinations and reactions of students therefore do far more to hinder the fullest expression of freedom of speech on campus than the actions taken by our administration.
Instead, most students express their opinions on a smaller scale, organizing and acting in small groups focused on specific issues. While a select few students devote much of their undergraduate lives to specific causes, popular large-scale movements are an exception. This may leave students with the impression that Harvard is not unified, but splintered among different interest groups. With a student body that appears as establishment and conformity-minded as contemporary Harvard’s, it is not hard to explain why more far-reaching campus discourse seems stunted. Harvard has not violated the intrinsic freedoms of its student body. Then again, with the self-censorship and relative disinterest that our administrators encounter, they have not had the opportunity. Even including Harvard in a freedom of speech ranking seems nearly irrelevant.

Here we go again. President Mahmoud Ahmadinijad, Iran’s stubborn and mercurial leader, is flaunting his country’s military might in the face of growing international resentment. This time around the threat of conflict is more palpable than ever. Although the Iranian government insists that its nuclear constructs are for purely civilian purposes, recent actions do not lend credibility to this assertion. Ahmadinejad says he wishes to cooperate with the west, but his gestures have seemed more hawkish than conciliatory. His supposed display of diplomacy becomes more farcical when the Iranian leader accuses the United States of trying to deter Iran’s nuclear program in order to “save the Zionist entity.” Issuing such assertions does little to advance the dialogue between the sides—after all, why would the “Zionist entity” need to be saved if the nuclear program had only peaceful intent. Iranian leadership must come to the realization that pursuing its nuclear ambitions will bring no gains to its global sense of authority. Rather, the quest for the bomb is both economically and geopolitically debilitating for Iran.
 Ahmadinijad’s rhetoric aside, what insights can one glean from Iran’s economic interests? As it turns out, there is really only one to thing to note here: the one-dimensional nature of Iran’s economy. Largely dependent on oil exports, it cannot expect to maintain its current economic trajectory without its most valuable resource. This is exactly why the sanctions imposed by the west carry so much weight. Obviously, a short term spike in oil prices is inevitable. Iran will do everything it can to inflict wallet shock on the western citizenry. This strategy, however, is unsustainable. In addition to the European oil embargo, the U.S. has frozen all central banking transactions with Iran. The west has effectively put the regime in a stranglehold, clenching the Iranian economy in a vice grip. Although the regime has considerable geopolitical leverage with its oil reserves, western economies can collectively take the hit from a blip in oil prices to force Tehran to yield. According to the U.S Energy Information Administration, Iran is not even among the United   States’ top five foreign sources of oil. Other options exist for the west in the short term. 
President Obama recently released a statement reassuring U.S. allies that world markets have enough crude oil to allow the U.S. to proceed with imposing more sanctions on Iran. Even in an election year, the Obama administration has been steadfast and resolute in issuing sanctions. There is clearly a high enough level of confidence in alternative sources of oil, since the last thing Obama would invite is a Republican campaign focused on exorbitant gas prices. Furthermore, the International Energy Agency projects that the embargo will slash Iran’s oil exports by 50 percent. The presence of energy alternatives gives the west the clear advantage in the game of chicken that Iran wants to play. So what economic incentives exist for Iran? To even the most jaded Iranian official, this all must be very clear. If Iran’s leadership recognizes the blatant economic peril of losing oil revenue, it should make concessions.
 Along with the direct consequences of its actions, Iran must also concern itself with the more subtle outcomes of its policies. Its clandestine pursuit of a nuclear weapon will rattle the cages of many neighbors. As history shows us, acquiring nuclear capability has consistently proved to be a shock for the surrounding countries of armed nations, typically leading to a reassessment of relations. Iran is already short on allies in the region—relying largly on the embattled Assad regime in Syria—and making others wary is not a smart thing to do. Countries in the Middle East may cut off diplomatic proceedings with the nation, and impose sanctions of their own. Such regional instability, in the long term, will be a great cost to Iran. It is up to Ahmadinejad’s discretion whether the benefit of annihilating its enemies on the basis of zealotry is worth this cost. 
 The international community understands that it has limited options to deter a country hell bent on acquiring nuclear weapons. Diplomacy can only go so far when dealing with fringe leaders like Ahmadinijad. If only Iranian leadership could acknowledge that there are very few long-term benefits to building a nuclear weapon, the entire global community would be better off. Ahmadinejad and company have taken the narrowest of perspectives on the welfare of the nation. The Iranian people, many of whom are fed up with the direction of the country, will be the ones who pay the price of poor decision-making. All we can do is hope that the current situation does not reach such a precipice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This has been a contentious year on campus, with students raising concerns on issues ranging from a library restructuring cloaked in secrecy to the ethical investment of Harvard’s endowment. Graduate and undergraduate activists have achieved important victories such as a fairer custodial contract and divestment from HEI Hotels & Resorts, but graduate students have been largely forced to work outside the established channels of student representation in voicing their concerns. While the Undergraduate Council proposal for a Harvard University Forum for Change gained widespread student group support, it was not embraced by the University, leaving the UC with a one-off meeting last semester at which graduate students were not included. We write as candidates for the Graduate Student Council Executive Committee, running along with others who share our vision, because graduate students deserve real democratic representation. The current executive board led by President Cammi Valdez has failed to provide the leadership and vision we want to bring to the GSC.
In our early years of graduate study in Psychology and History, we shared a common concern that the graduate student voice was missing. When each of us asked friends and classmates about the GSC and its open meetings, we were told that they were meaningless gatherings for the rubber-stamping of student group funding. Rather than join them in dismissing it, we decided, at different stages, to engage. While we entered with optimism, the current leadership has left us disillusioned.
After a year of service on the Executive Committee alongside seasoned incumbents, and repeated attempts to spur change from within, we are forced to conclude that a change in leadership is necessary. Three examples will illustrate why. Firstly, Summer Shafer put forward a resolution condemning violence against student protestors. The Undergraduate Council unanimously condemned the violence, but the GSC executive board, led by President Cammi Valdez, wanted to have nothing to do with this simple message of solidarity and support for free speech. The current leadership claimed that such statements were not the job of the GSC (though the GSC constitution clearly authorizes such resolutions), and attempted to limit debate by allowing only five minutes for representatives to debate the issue. Valdez refused opportunities to extend the open meeting at which it was discussed. Despite all the obstruction and opposition of the current executive board, the assembled GSC representatives passed the resolution condemning campus violence by a wide margin, indicating a broad consensus of graduate student opinion behind it.  Unsurprisingly, the Executive Board failed to properly publicize the resolution even after the GSC representatives had decisively overruled their opposition, and still refuse demands to publish the voting record of representatives.
Next came the issue of changes to the GSC constitution. Concerns have been highlighted by a past GSC parliamentarian, including the absence of an election of departmental representatives, a direct election of Officers, and a procedure for GSAS-wide voting on resolutions for issues of concern. Instead of tackling these challenges and making the GSC more democratic, the current leadership used a constitutional committee of which we were members to focus on correcting such minor issues as wording and numbering, leaving no time to consider governance reforms.  The only substantive amendments presented at open meetings have been aimed to constrict, not expand, democracy in the GSC—an unobtainable quorum for debates on future resolutions that could be used as a gag rule, a proposal to limit the right to speak at meetings to those who have paid their $25 membership fee, and a rule limiting eligibility for the office of President to those already on the Executive Committee, which risks institutionalizing a pattern of insider cronyism at the GSC.
Lastly, we are fed up with the absence of any effort to obtain more meaningful student input to GSC decision-making. Neither we as at-large representatives, nor the graduate students we represent, have once been asked for suggestions for agenda items at board, sub-committee or deans’ meetings, all of which we have been told are at the discretion of the President. Partly thanks to the insistence of one of us, an email channel to all GSAS students was finally opened, but it remains jealously guarded.
We believe that reform of the Graduate Student Council, the voice of the thousands of graduate students at Harvard, is possible and necessary. We know we can help it become a representative body that advocates on live issues of student concern, such as a health plan that meets the needs of all students, fair contracts for graduate student research assistants in the natural sciences, and a tax exemption for graduate student stipends—issues fought for by student governments in other top universities. In order to achieve these goals, graduate students, like all Harvard students, need leadership that is committed to democratic and inclusive principles. Without this, our achievements will remain limited by our struggle simply to be heard.
 
Jennifer A. Sheehy-Skeffington is a third year doctoral student in Psychology and the at-large representative for International Students at the Graduate Student Council. Summer A. Shafer is a third year doctoral student in History of American Civilizations, and the co-at-large representative for Interdisciplinary Studies at the Graduate Student Council.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The high and rising number of students in American schools who do not speak English as their first language creates an educational challenge that is too often addressed with politics rather than science. Many education advocates propose providing courses in a student’s native language until their English proficiency allows them to enter standard classes, often several years later. Others extol English immersion of some type, either assisted or free-fall. The social, cultural, and scientific reality is that a more nuanced approach is both possible and necessary in order to ensure that all American students can flourish in an English-mediated academic setting. I believe that elements of bilingual education ought to be more widely and openly embraced in light of overwhelming evidence supporting its advantages, which have been consistently shown to benefit all students regardless of linguistic and cultural background.
The impetus for reform is derived from the fact that a large proportion of immigrant students from under-privileged socioeconomic backgrounds who speak another language at home (especially Spanish) do not compare academically with their monolingual counterparts and drop out at a disproportionately high rate. None of the commonly advocated policies have yet remedied this problem, largely because they fail to acknowledge the main thing underlying these statistics—that these students struggle in the academic environment because they face unique linguistic and cultural challenges unknown to their monolingual counterparts, which are not properly addressed by educational policies. It is not bilingual education per se, but rather the inherent inequality that exists in both the common systems of bilingual education now, which perpetuate segregation within schools, and universal English immersion programs, which too often overlook the unique challenges and opportunities of young bilingual learners, that causes the problem.
Numerous studies have identified multiple advantages of bilingualism that are relevant to academic success, especially in the areas of language and general cognition. For instance, contrary to popular belief, educating students in their mother tongue has been shown to have a positive effect on English development, as well. This pertains especially to bilingual students speaking two historically related languages such as Spanish and English. Through the “cross language transfer” of phonological awareness, young bilinguals who gain reading proficiency in one language are able to make inferences about the other. Bilingualism also brings meta-linguistic awareness, or the conscious awareness of the fundamental functioning of language, which is immensely beneficial to both literacy development in young students and future language learning. With regard to general cognition, bilingualism has been shown to enable significantly better executive function, including mental control processes such as thought inhibition and the ability to disengage attention, both of which are robust indicators of academic success.
In other words, a strong theoretical case can be made for bilingual education for all students. With greater command of their native languages, young bilinguals in particular can develop language skills in both languages and reap the associated benefits, both in terms of cognition and of better understanding of academic content. On the other hand, young native English-speaking students who are provided with immersive foreign language instruction in a bilingual environment can also benefit from their own budding bilingualism. As these students undergo similar challenges to the ones bilingual students constantly face, they can help create a more egalitarian and accepting school environment where all students, regardless of linguistic and cultural background, can have a more equal opportunity for academic achievement.
Even with the cognitive and linguistic benefits of further developing proficiency in their native language, non-native English speakers must learn English quickly or risk academic isolation. This goal must be achieved through sheltered English instruction—academic subjects taught in patient English coupled with English as a Second Language instruction, all taught by bilingual teachers capable of providing full support to both students and parents. Schools should also foster the consistent development of educators who, even if not fluently bilingual, are aware of the linguistic and cultural challenges faced by some of their students and have reached proficiency in a second language. Implementing such a policy would be a tremendous challenge, but the positive learning outcomes that would result would be immensely worthwhile.
In order to realize any change in the U.S., the whole debate on bilingual education has to be decoupled from the often-vitriolic social and political discourse. In Sweden, for instance, strong support is given to programs that provide mother tongue language instruction, despite public political debates over immigration. With such support, immigrant students are empowered to learn fluent Swedish and enter mainstream academic and economic society, while Swedish students, who are themselves learning foreign languages including English, are also able to reap the benefits of bilingualism. As such, unlike in the U.S., the benefits conferred by bilingualism are embraced in the Swedish system in a manner that does not confound the role of Swedish as the official social and academic language. Given the proven linguistic, cognitive, social, and cultural advantages of bilingualism, there is serious need for the U.S. to look at the issue objectively and scientifically and to strive for an optimal policy of bilingual education that would allow all students to reach their potential in the mainstream academic setting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the United States Department of Education has repealed its December verdict that found Virginia Tech’s response to a 2007 campus shooting in violation of the Clery Act, emergency protocol at universities will likely remained unchanged.
The Clery Act requires universities to issue “timely warnings” to students following an incident that could pose a threat to their safety. It also mandates that university police departments maintain a public crime log and release annual security reports.
In April 2007, a shooter at Virginia Tech opened fire, killing 32 people and wounding 25 more before committing suicide.
In December 2011, the Department of Education required that Virginia Tech pay a fee of $55,000 for its alleged failure to issue warnings out to students in a timely manner.
On Friday an administrative law judge at the Department of Education ruled that the school’s actions did not violate the Clery Act.
The email warning was sent to students two hours after the first shots were fired at Viriginia Tech. Soon after the message was sent, the shooter opened fire again.
Though the original verdict was repealed, it had already had a significant impact on university policies across the country.
Discussion about emergency protocol is likely to continue in light of Monday’s fatal shooting at Oikos University in Oakland, Calif. that resulted in at least seven deaths.
Attorney Harvey A. Silverglate said he believes that despite the repeal, the original verdict will have a large effect on college administrations.
“One of the major principles of the governance of American institutions of higher learning is to limit liability,” said Silverglate, who specializes in criminal defense, civil liberties, and academic freedom. “The place is run by the lawyers. It’s no longer academic freedom; it’s ‘how do we avoid being sued?’”
Silverglate said that many times colleges overreact to legislation, such as the Clery Act, leading administrators to infringe upon the rights of students.
“Once liberty is taken away it is not given back, especially when it is in the name of safety,” he said.
Nonetheless, the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting changed the way that many colleges implement their emergency protocol systems.
College campuses across the nation reevaluated their policies in the wake of the Virginia Tech shooting and many implemented an emergency messaging system.
HUPD Spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email that “like all police departments across the country, the HUPD did examine its planning and training for handling life-threatening emergencies.”
At Harvard, Community Alerts and the MessageMe system are used to keep students informed about potential threats.
Harvard University Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin emphasized the importance of students’ safety and security to the administration in an emailed statement, adding that the administration is “continually reviewing and updating [its] emergency preparedness and procedures.”
He also wrote that the administration and the HUPD work closely together. “...if an alert needs to be sent, we will have several individuals who are able to act in a timely fashion,” he wrote.

With the new taco truck outside the Science Center, Mexican restaurant owners in Harvard Square now face more competition than ever before.
When Felipe’s Taqueria opened eight years ago, it was the only taqueria in Cambridge. Today, there are four burrito restaurants within a few blocks of the Square.
“We think competition is good. It keeps you sharp and keeps you honest,” said Thomas J. Brush, co-owner of Felipe’s Taqueria.
Similarly, Allison M. Doyle, Boloco’s strategic project manager, said, “It’s great to have an additional restaurant in the neighborhood.”
Nevertheless, Brush noted that restaurants must adapt to the intense competition in the Square to survive.
Some other Mexican restaurants have resorted to new marketing strategies to attract Harvard students to their restaurants.
Boloco has worked to develop an online presence on Facebook and Twitter, and uses a website that allows patrons to order online.
For example, Boloco used new media to popularize events like “free burrito day,” which celebrated the company’s fifteenth birthday two weeks ago.
According to Doyle, the restaurant served exactly 1,200 free burritos at their Harvard Square location.
Events like this hopefully introduce students to a menu that features “globally inspired” burritos with Indian, Thai, and BBQ themes, as well as a classic Mexican option, Doyle said.
She said that she hopes that their diverse range of options will differentiate Boloco’s food from that of its competitors.
Restaurants like Mexican grill Qdoba have pushed paper-marketing campaigns, including coupons that offered Harvard students a free entrée with any other purchase a few weeks ago.
But marketing strategies are “all just smoke and mirrors,” said Brush, who relies on word of mouth to attract customers.
According to Brush, his restaurant has enjoyed immense popularity since it opened despite the emergence of countless competing eateries. He attributes his success to the restaurant’s traditional Mexican fare, fresh ingredients, and satisfied customers.
“Whoever delivers the best food, they’ll survive,” Brush said.
When informed that the taco truck would accept both BoardPlus and Crimson Cash, Brush jokingly said, “Oh my god, I better start taking Crimson Cash.”
However, he immediately added that his restaurant draws customers with low prices for the best quality—something he can provide if only by avoiding the five percent charge paid by restaurants that accept Crimson Cash.

Google Ideas Director Jared Cohen discussed the way that changing technology has affected how governments handle social issues at the Harvard Kennedy School on Monday.
“In the last ten years we have seen an explosion of technological access,” Cohen said. “This means that tech will be part of every problem in the future.”
The event was part of the Center for Public Leadership’s “Leadership and Internet” lecture series.
Cohen “has a massive vision for change,” said Kate Krontiris, a graduate student at the Kennedy School who has worked with Cohen at Google Ideas, a technology-oriented think tank.
The first part of the event, which was moderated by Kennedy School adjunct lecturer Nicco Mele, focused on Cohen’s career and work for Google.
Cohen has worked as an advisor to both Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, helping to draft the State Department’s 21st Century Statecraft policy. After leaving the State Department in 2010, Cohen joined Google Ideas as its new director.
For Cohen, the transition from the public to private sector was natural. “I have been working on the same issue since 2004,” he said, referring to his commitment to encourage governments and other institutions to employ new technologies in their work.
When asked how he would describe Google Ideas, Cohen said “I don’t know exactly what you would call Google Ideas, but I like to think of it as a think/do tank.” The team at Google Ideas is a small team that works in a “democratic fashion” to try to solve issues facing the world, Cohen said.
Google Ideas is a small offshoot of Google that seeks to aid fragile states and counter violent extremism and illicit trafficking networks.
Cohen said that “working at Google Ideas is like working at a startup without having to work in a garage or take out the trash.”
Cohen specifically addressed the undergraduates present, saying that he is “envious of people in school right now, as they have an innate technological expertise.”
If students do not take advantage of this skill, Cohen added, “they’d be shooting themselves in the foot.”
Cohen said that he feels confident in our future because technology will continue to evolve and grow to meet society’s demands.
“There is no greater driver of innovation than necessity,” Cohen said.
As the discussion concluded, Cohen stressed the importance of using advanced technologies to tackle the major issues facing the world.
“The intersection of technology and geo-politics will have a profound impact on today’s world,” he said.

Harvard hopes to publicly launch its University-wide capital campaign in 2013. The campaign will likely aim to raise at least $6 billion, according to senior administrators and people with knowledge of the situation, which would likely make it the largest capital campaign ever run by an institution of higher education.
The campaign is currently in its quiet phase—a period when University fundraisers aim to raise a large portion of the final campaign goal through hushed solicitation of major contributions. Only once the quiet phase is complete will the University announce its official monetary target and priorities for spending the donations.
“While we are planning for an eventual University-wide capital campaign and are considering a late 2013 launch, decisions about the timing and the goal have not been finalized,” wrote Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 in a statement.
The University, tight-lipped about its plans for the upcoming campaign, has until recently declined to comment on the timeline.
The campaign will likely last about five years past its public launch, Steven Oliveira, dean for development and alumni relations at Harvard Law School, told The Crimson in 2011.
According to University President Drew G. Faust, Harvard has not yet set a final monetary goal. Stanford recently set the record for a university capital campaign. Between 2006 and 2011, Stanford raised $6.23 billion.
Peter L. Malkin ’55, a prominent donor to the University, did not offer an exact figure for the campaign goal. He said, however, that “the amount we’re talking about is incredible.”
Administrators have said that House renewal, one of the projects most likely to benefit from the campaign, will alone cost between $1 billion to $1.3 billion.
“The number one priority from my point of view is House renewal,” Malkin said. “There are a lot of alumni who have very fond memories of the House in which they [lived].”
Other likely priorities include University construction in Allston, expansion of Harvard’s financial aid program, and initiatives to promote “teaching and learning.”
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said that plans for Allston would likely “figure prominently” in the campaign.
“What I would like to see happen in Allston is for it to become a model for collaboration across disciplines for the University,” Garber said.
The University recently announced a $30 million gift from Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 and Katherine A. O’Donnell as a major quiet phase donation.
In 1999, Harvard wrapped up its last capital campaign, which totaled at $2.6 billion.
Discussions regarding the upcoming capital campaign have been in the works since just after the previous one concluded. The resignation of University President Lawrence H. Summers in 2005 and the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 forced administrators to delay the planning process until recently.
As the University moves closer to publicly announcing its current campaign, administrators say that the state of the economy continues to affect their decisions.
“We are operating in a world that’s a little more unpredictable in terms of where the economy is going,” Faust said. “We want to make sure that we understand the environment really well before we go public.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than 10 percent of Harvard’s female freshmen, sophomores, and juniors chose to rush sororities for the past two years, Harvard’s female Greek organizations plan to bring a fourth sorority to Cambridge.
The three present sororities are in the nascent stages of choosing which sorority will join their ranks at Harvard.
According to members of the sororities who have been informed of the news, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma have embarked on a multi-step process to identify a sorority that will improve Greek life. When Kappa Kappa Gamma, the most recent addition to Harvard’s Greek scene, came to campus in 2003, the two other sororities worked with the National Panhellenic Council—the coordinating body for 26 international women’s fraternities and sororities—to pick Kappa.
For the past year, chapter leaders entertained the idea of adding a fourth sorority due to the high number of women who have rushed over the past two seasons. In 2011, a record-high 268 girls rushed—the largest rush class in the College’s history. This season, about 250 women rushed. The slight drop did not deter Janet M. Yarboi ’12, president of the Panhellenic Council, from expressing hope for a fourth sorority.
“If interest still continues to be this high, we want to accommodate as many people as possible,” Yarboi told The Crimson at the conclusion of the 2012 rush process.
Carolina I. Ragolta '13, president of Delta Gamma, declined to comment on the formation of a fourth sorority but wrote in an email, “In an environment as demanding and stressful as Harvard, it doesn't surprise me that more women want to be part of such a phenomenal community.”
The presidents of Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma could not be reached for comment. Taylor A. Compton ’13, the current president of the Panhellenic Council, declined to comment.
Harvard is not alone in seeing increased interest in Greek life. Last year, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, and Cornell all voted to bring another sorority to their campuses.
Cabot House Master Stephanie R. Khurana—who served as president of Cornell’s Panhellenic Council as an undergraduate and as a member of Cornell’s Fraternity and Sorority Advisory Council as an alumna—said that Harvard’s House system creates a “unique community” that can serve as an alternative to Greek life. “I think it’s important to keep in mind some of the broader goals of fostering Harvard’s unique ability to create a strong undergraduate community through its residential house system,” Khurana wrote in an email.
Khurana, who has previously spoken out against adding a fourth sorority when the option was discussed, said she was unaware that it is now in the works.
As has been Harvard practice since the first sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, came to Harvard in 1993, Harvard will not recognize Greek organizations that “discriminate” and have off-campus parent organizations, according to Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson.
Nelson wrote in an email that the University will continue to meet with the groups’ leaders every semester to ensure that they comply with the Student Handbook.
Delta Gamma followed Theta to Harvard one year later. Two of Harvard’s three fraternities—Sigma Chi in 1989 and Alpha Epsilon Pi in 1998—are modern additions, but Sigma Alpha Epsilon has a longer history at Harvard, dating back to 1893.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team completed two regattas this past weekend—one minutes away at Boston University and the other, slightly further, at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. For both the Boston University Trophy and Ted Ferrarone Team Races, the Crimson battled the elements and a series of tough teams for its place in the ranks.
FERRARONE TEAM RACE
Harvard competed in one of its few team racing events of the year in the Ferrarone Team Race on Saturday and Sunday.
In team racing, as opposed to fleet racing, teams sail head-to-head against other three-boat teams, trying to finish with a lower cumulative score.
Like fleet racing, the low-point scoring system is used: a boat is given the number of points that match its place in the race. A team needs ten or fewer points to win.
This race pooled teams from a number of conferences: from the MAISA—the U.S. Naval Academy—from the NEISA—Roger Williams University, Brown University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dartmouth College—from the PCCSC—Stanford University—and finally from the SAISA—University of South Florida.
While Harvard frequently encounters NEISA schools, the Ferrarone races were a unique opportunity to sail against schools from the MAISA, PCCSC, and SAISA.
Bristol, R.I., where the races were held, was brisk with temperatures remaining under 50 degrees.
Saturday was a soggy sailing day but brought strong winds. In contrast, when the races were meant to start on Sunday, the sun was out and teams could hardly detect a breeze.
“There was initially no breeze,” senior Alexandra Jumper said. “But partway through the day we got a really nice southerly breeze that came in, which was great for racing.”
On the first day of the regatta, the Crimson beat out USF, Stanford, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Dartmouth. Harvard finished the day, 4-3, but faced a more difficult schedule the following day.
The next time out, Harvard went 2-5 on the water, beating Dartmouth for the second day in a row and also topping the home team, Roger Williams.
On Sunday, the final day of the regatta, Harvard recorded five wins and only one loss, the best record for the Rhode Island trip.
“Sunday we were sailing against teams some of which weren’t quite as competitive, so you have to take that into account,” Jumper said. “But it was nice that we could hold our own and execute team racing moves.”
The Crimson completed the regatta second in the silver fleet, and sixth overall, with an 11-9 total record. While this was not the ideal finish, the Harvard sailing team has much more team racing to look forward to.
“It was one of our first big team racing events this season,” Jumper said. “We’re just trying to get as much practice in leading up to our big qualifier race at the end of the month.”
BOSTON UNIVERSITY TROPHY
Saturday saw a couple obstacles for the sailors—it was raining and the report time was late—but Harvard still competed at the Boston University Sailing Pavillion. A total of eight races in division A and 6 in B were completed all on course 4s.
A shifty easterly, ranging from six to ten knots in long oscillations, made the Crimson boats work to stay in phase and finish well.
With Sunday came much needed warmth but a swirling wind that demanded constant course changes came along with it.
Harvard finished in thirteenth place out of 18 boats in this competitive regatta. Still, its place does not indicate the Crimson’s performance.
“We did have good showings against some of the more competitive teams,” Jumper said. “But we didn’t necessarily perform as well as we wanted to against some of the teams that we should have done better against.”
Sophomore Luke O’Connor and freshman Rebecca Frankel sailed in the A division. Their 93 points tied the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, resulting in a head-to-head tiebreaker.
Although O’Connor and Frankel lost the tiebreaker, they managed two top-10 finishes, even placing first in their first heat.
Overall, Harvard finished with 175 points—far behind the Terriers, the home team and the victors—but on the heels of Northeastern and Boston College.
“It’s an ongoing process of trying to put all our boat handling and tactical knowledge together and execute,” Jumper said.

Most years, Senior Night for the Harvard men’s volleyball team falls at the end of the season, after the playoff picture is settled and the celebration of the players takes the front seat over the scoreline.
But this season, the Crimson could  not afford to let anything come before the result on Saturday night, as the squad sits in second place in the EIVA rankings and still has a good playoff seeding to play for.
And in front of his friends and family, Matt Jones did what he has done for all four of his years at Harvard: score.
The co-captain tallied a team-high 14 kills in the Crimson’s 3-0 sweep over conference rival NJIT, as Harvard gained a two-game lead over third place St. Francis and kept pace with top-ranked No. 8 Penn State in the race towards the EIVA tournament.
And regardless of the Senior Night festivities, Jones said he always feeds off the Crimson crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center, believing the home fuels his performances.
“It’s always nice to have the crowd behind you, and on big points it really gets you going,” Jones said. “When you’re on the road, you have to build your momentum, and you know you’re doing well when the crowd is quiet. But that’s definitely not the same as when you’re at home…and the gym gets noisy and the other team gets rattled. It’s big.”
The outside hitter registered four service aces, six digs, and three blocks in Saturday’s win, building on his 15 kills and three service aces from the night before in Harvard’s 3-1 defeat of Rutgers-Newark.
It was during Jones’ service at the beginning of the fourth set against the Scarlet Raiders when Harvard jumped out to a large lead. The senior also delivered five kills in the final frame, preventing the Rutgers-Newark from ever denting the Crimson’s lead.
Jones has been a standout player for the team since his rookie season, when he played in all but one set. The La Jolla, Calif. native did one better his sophomore season, playing all 75 sets while leading the team with 4.50 kills per set.
“Matt will run down balls and overpower guys from an athletic standpoint,” said sophomore outside hitter Nick Madden. “He makes plays that a lot of volleyball players don’t expect.... Against good teams, you need guys like that, who are going to step up and make difficult plays happen when the game is close. He does that consistently.”
In his junior year, Jones and co-captain Dan Schreff took charge of a team filled with young talent. Under their leadership, the past two seasons have seen members of both 2014 and 2015, like Madden, take on major roles on the court.
“He’s very strategic in the way he thinks,” Madden said. “He’ll contemplate what he’s going to say before he says it, which is valuable in a captain because he doesn’t say things in a team context that he hasn’t put a lot of thought into. So when he talks, people listen.”
This season, Jones ranks third in the EIVA in both kills per set (3.74) and service aces per set (.47), keeping Harvard on pace for the second seed in the conference tournament, the winner of which will earn a berth to the NCAA Championship in May.
And as Jones ends his fourth year, so does Crimson coach Brian Baise, who began his career in the same 2009 season as Jones.
“The team is now the direct result of his recruiting,” Jones said of his coach. “This season is the culmination of all the work he has done, and I think he will continue to do those things in the future.”
Baise believes Jones has had a similar impact on today’s team.
“He’s been a great collaborator in building this program in the last four years,” Baise said. “He’s as competitive and committed athlete as I’ve ever coached.”
Baise believes Jones’ experience and poise will be crucial for the Crimson’s success down the final stretch of the season.
“Matt keeps us focused,” Baise said. “He makes sure that everyone is focused on the point we’re playing right at that moment…. I think his intensity and his focus are absolutely essential to these last four matches.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 12
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Jones had a record of .047 service aces per set during the season. In fact, Jones' record was .47 service aces per set.

On Monday night, the No. 9 Virginia women’s lacrosse team came out early and never looked back. The Cavaliers notched two goals in the first three minutes of their Monday night matchup with Harvard and proceeded to roll throughout the first half, building a 6-1 advantage.
The early deficit was too much for the Crimson (4-6, 1-2 Ivy) to overcome, falling to Virginia (9-4, 2-2 ACC), 12-6, at Klockner Stadium in Charlottesville, Va.
With the win, the Cavaliers improved to 6-0 all-time against the Crimson and 6-1 at home this season, while Harvard fell to 1-3 on the road. The loss also marked Harvard’s second-straight defeat at the hands of a top-10 team after Saturday’s 10-6 loss to No. 2 Syracuse.
Virginia took control of the game early and seemed to bury Harvard from the beginning.
“Going into the game, we knew they were a team that possessed the ball well,” said junior Danielle Tetreault, who led the Crimson with two goals. “We needed to take the opportunities we had and take care of the ball and put them away.”
But the Crimson struggled to hold onto the ball, committing 14 turnovers compared to the Cavaliers’ six. The turnover imbalance contributed to Virginia’s offensive effort—in the first half, it outshot the Crimson, 10-3.
The Cavaliers controlled the opening draw and sophomore Katie Slater scored 14 seconds into the contest off a pass from freshman Sloan Warren. Virginia stretched the lead two minutes later after senior Josie Owen found the net.
“They won that first draw control, and they are a transition team,” Tetreault said. “That’s something we knew we would have to take care of going into [the game], but they were able to put one away right in the beginning.”
Harvard responded when Jenn Leffew scored to pull the Crimson within one with a little under 18 minutes to go in the first half.
But the Cavaliers then took off on a 4-0 run to take a commanding 6-1 lead. The last two goals were scored in the final 17 seconds of the half, leaving Harvard with an uphill battle coming out of the break.
Virginia’s run continued in the opening minutes of the second half when Owen scored her third goal of the game, putting Virginia ahead, 7-1.
Harvard was able to get on the board again when co-captain Melanie Baskind scored an unassisted goal. But Owen was able to come right back and put one away off a free-position shot, which gave Virginia an 8-2 advantage.
The Crimson rallied with a 3-0 run featuring a Tetreault score that was followed by sophomore Kyleigh Keating’s first goal of the season. Tetreault was able to find the net again with a little under 11 minutes remaining, which pulled Harvard within three and gave the team a shot at a comeback.
But once again it was Owen who squashed the Crimson’s chances with two consecutive goals, giving her six on the game and 28 on the season. Owen’s final score extended the Cavaliers’ lead back to five with seven minutes remaining in the contest.
Harvard junior attack Jennifer VanderMeulen put away an unassisted score before Virginia senior Ainsley Baker and junior Caroline McTiernan were able to close out the game with consecutive goals, giving the Cavaliers the 12-6 victory.
Though the Crimson played Virginia tight in the second frame, outshooting the home squad, 11-9, in the half, the Cavaliers’ early lead proved to be insurmountable.
While Owen led the charge for Virginia, seven Cavaliers players scored in the win. Tetreault led Harvard with two goals, and Baskind recorded two points with a goal and an assist.
“We need to make sure we keep playing as a team,” Tetreault said. “We have a lot of skillful players, and we just need to take advantage of what we have and find a way to make it mesh all together.”

Remember the moment you got into Harvard? Of course you do. And, as jaded as you may be—or pretend to be—, it's always fun to relive the magic with the College's newest crop of admitted students. Flyby caught up with a couple of them to talk about exorbitant Facebook friending, awkward questions, and weeping puppies.
Sofia Gomez  (Miami, Fla.)
What did you do when you found out you had gotten in? 
I was at my dinner table with my best friend and my mom waiting for the email, and I didn't know how to react. I started screaming "I got into Harvard!"
Any enhanced Facebook activity? 
I made my status that I got in and I had like six friend requests after. People wrote on my wall, guys wrote on my wall saying congratulations. A bunch of random people I haven't talked to in a long time, random guys, texted me.
Have you been asked on any Harvard-related dates?
I don't know...None yet. It's only been a couple days, but hopefully!
Did you know that every time someone chooses Yale over Harvard a small, adorable puppy sobs?
Oh really? I didn't know that one. I'll definitely take that into account...I crossed Yale off my list earlier today.
Amna Hashmi (Baltimore, Md.)
Who was the first person you called?
My dad, actually, because he wasn't home at the time. So I was freaking out, running laps around my house—normal accepted mania. It was me and my mom and my sister. I really wanted to look at the email by myself, but they wouldn't let me.
Have you been getting more Facebook friend requests from randos?
Not a ton...I'd say about 10. But the Facebook group really exploded. I just couldn't handle the notifications.
Is Crimson your color?
Yeah, definitely. Always.
Did you know that every time someone chooses Yale over Harvard a small adorable puppy sobs?
I completely agree with that. I had to burn all my Yale clothing when I got into Harvard. Well, not burn it, but I did give it to my friend who was going to Yale.

If you're one of the many people who walk by J.P. Licks on a daily basis, you may have noticed something different these past few days: one of the store's windows, until Monday, was boarded up. The window was shattered when a scuffle between two unidentified groups on Mass. Ave. resulted in one male being pushed into the window and breaking it at approximately 12:45 a.m. on Saturday morning, according to the police report.
The J.P. Licks employee who filed the report with the police explained that the involved parties reportedly did not intend to break the window and fled the scene after causing the property damage.
As the report explains, "one male pushed another into the pane of glass at the store and broke it…They then fled down Mass. Ave. toward the square."
If broken windows ring a bell, you may be thinking of the debacle at Mr. Bartley's last year. Bartley was eager to point fingers at potential suspects, naming Joe Biden as a possibility as well as any unnamed drunk individual who may have "put a butt through it [the window]."
Where Bartley was willing to talk, however, those at J.P. Licks have declined to comment, leaving us to speculate on the identities of those involved in the scuffle. Having already replaced the broken window, we can only guess that J.P. Licks has decided to forgive and forget.
