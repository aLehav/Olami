After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid the current divisive atmosphere of United States politics, it’s easy to cast the Syrian Civil War as yet another issue on a long list of political problems. However, “Cries From Syria,” a HBO documentary directed by Oscar nominee Evgeny Afineevsky, brings Syria’s humanitarian crisis back to the forefront of the world’s attention. With its street-level view of a conflict that Western audiences typically only witness from a distance, this piece is a striking reminder of the suffering that the Syrian people have endured and the civilian death toll that continues to climb. The documentary may be difficult to watch, but the combination of real-time footage and testimonies demands empathy for the victims of the conflict.
To document this crisis, “Cries From Syria” compiles footage that citizens and journalists have collected over the past six years. From mass protests and speeches by peace activists to firefights and bombings, the film outlines the progression of the Syrian government’s oppressive actions and the people’s resistance. The film’s graphic footage of this treatment is extremely difficult to watch. This particular footage feels more authentic and emotionally vivid than would polished video from a professional film crew. Instead of the high definition pan-action that viewers typically expect, “Cries From Syria” makes use of grainy, unstable clips to successfully recreate the moment in which they were captured.
The film also collects interviews of Syrian people, including rebel leaders, activists, refugees, and the families and friends of victims of the Assad regime. Afineevsky chooses to omit  interviewers from the documentary completely, creating personal accounts that focus solely on the subjects. The result is coverage that reveals the people directly affected by the war, and emphasizes the loss of human life and liberty above anything else. The interviews with young children included in “Cries From Syria” are especially striking, revealing a generation of Syrians whose exposure to conflict has forced them to grow up too quickly. The combination of interviews and amateur footage elicits sympathy from an audience that might not otherwise grasp the severity of the war.
As the violence spreads across more cities, “Cries From Syria” shows a map of the country to track the war’s progress. Each new city is surrounded in red as Bashar al-Assad’s military bathes it in blood. Similar artistic qualities throughout the film—like its symbolic use of color—lend it a level of impressive sophistication.
Despite the fact that the film concludes with various Syrian residents and refugees talking about their dreams for the future, “Cries From Syria” does not aspire to be an uplifting work. It emphasizes the ongoing battle Syrians face, from fighting against tyranny in their home country to the obstacles they encounter when attempting to escape. It also succeeds in showing how the Syrian people are really engaged in self-defense through its collected footage and interviews, despite the regime’s effort to cast the civilians as terrorists.

“I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,” a duet between country-turned-pop star Taylor Swift and boyband-defector Zayn Malik, is the highest profile release from the soundtrack of the latest installment of the “Fifty Shades” trilogy. Although this reporter has never laid eyes on E.L. James’ critically acclaimed sexy trash fiction, one can only assume “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” is a video SparkNotes of sorts. Think of Zayn and Taylor as a pair of fun TFs leading a review section. Only this is no ordinary review section: it’s a scandalous review section.
We open with a shot of an expensive-looking car pulling up in the rain. A perfectly coiffed yet sad Zayn emerges. Cameras flash. A horde of aggressive paparazzi silently screams aggressive questions at him, which probably range from “Why do you sound American when you sing, even though you’re British?” to “Can one ever make sense of a non-reductionist view of theoretical entities?” to “Is it weird that you’re collaborating with your ex-bandmate’s ex-girlfriend, or does that double negative cancel itself out? Like, are you therefore on the same side now? How does that work?”
But Zayn, like most famous people, knows he’s too important for these trivialities. He passes right through the hotel lobby. A paparazzi ambushes him. (What the hell? How did he get in here? No. Focus, Zayn!) Nonchalant, he enters an elevator, illuminated alternately by red and green lights, and starts singing, impressively enunciating while barely moving his mouth. Taylor Swift won’t call him back, and he’s sad about that.
Lucky for Zayn, Taylor is in the same hotel. Even better, she’s in the same elevator, which seems to be some sort of infinite rotating room. But Taylor is having problems too: existential problems. “Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life, oh,” she sings uncertainly, as she stretches her neck, clearly suffering some kind of excruciatingly painful neck cramp. Unaware that dodging bullets and suffering romantic worries are not mutually exclusive, Taylor enters a hotel room.
Surprise: Zayn is also here. How did he get here from the elevator so quickly? (Answer/Certified Fun Zayn Fact: Zayn has a hidden talent for escaping both tight spaces and five-year boyband contracts.)
Zayn and Taylor start singing together about how much they detest immortality. This is the crux of the problem: they really, really don’t want to live forever. Sure, they may represent a collective net worth of $300 million, but their wants and needs transcend the crass materiality of luxury hotel rooms and the expensive champagne that Taylor Swift does not know when to stop pouring. They only want to keep calling each other’s names until they come back home.
But there are some obvious barriers to gratifying that goal, because both of them refuse to leave the hotel. This Catch-22 is so frustrating that they start taking it out on the hotel. Zayn violently destroys a place setting. Taylor tries to provoke a pillow fight with a wall. Zayn throws a bottle at what is hopefully a different wall. Taylor scratches a fabric headboard. Zayn overturns the table, because the place setting wasn’t enough. (Not pictured: Zayn pulling the concierge aside to explain that all the damages will go on Taylor’s tab, please. Not to be a jerk about this, but she does make up 83 percent of their collective net worth.)
In the climax (wink) of the sexy video, Zayn and Taylor finally lock eyes. There’s a brief flicker of recognition in their charged eye contact: maybe, just maybe, they actually won’t live forever.
This fleeting moment of hope at the sweet release of death is interrupted by the return of Taylor’s neck cramp. She turns around, ostensibly instructing Zayn to finally call her chiropractor. However, the pain is likely purely psychological: as Calvin Harris and Katy Perry might inform her, snakes don’t really have necks.

The last couple weeks of “Big Little Lies” have been all about interpersonal intricacy and emotional nuance. We’ve seen Celeste struggle to understand her status as an abused woman, Jane try to keep her rage under control, and Madeline grapple with her infidelity. This week, however, eases off the accelerator a little bit in terms of complexity. The emotional power remains, but “Burning Love” focuses more on the idea of building pressure than expanding internal landscapes.
After all, we’re rapidly approaching the final episode—the moment when somebody dies a violent death—and we need to really start believing that all of this emotion can spill over into brutal physical violence. Accordingly, this episode presents moments of escalated physicality, moments that certainly fall short of murder but nonetheless demonstrate the extent to which conflicts in Monterey can resolve themselves in bodily ways. After hearing that Renata has been petitioning for Ziggy’s suspension, Jane physically attacks her and ends up accidentally poking her in the eye. Bonnie, Nathan, and Abigail end up in a scuffle when Abigail reveals her plan to sell her virginity on the internet, and when Madeline finds out over dinner, she projectile vomits all over Bonnie’s table and then Bonnie herself. And then there’s Celeste and Perry. Perry tries to talk Celeste into sleeping with him, and when she continually pushes him away, he snaps and yanks her hair; she responds by swinging at him with a tennis racket, the result being a trip to the ER and a broken urethra.
The episode also practically overflows with uses of the word “kill.” Perry ironically tells Celeste, “You’re going to kill me. I have to go to Phoenix,” and Madeline offers a toast to her, Ed, Bonnie, and Nathan for “not killing each other.” A darker, less flip use of the word shows up when Perry—hobbling—growls at Celeste, “You’re lucky I didn’t kill you.” All of this near-slapstick violence and wordplay feels like appropriate escalation, but it also feels a little too hokey for a show that’s normally so mature.
Fortunately, the episode still contains a few moments of trademark sophistication and power. When Perry starts to manipulate Celeste, she stops him and says, “Look what you’re doing.” She points out his strategy in a flash of subtle empowerment. Jane and Ziggy (played by a particularly talented young actor) also share a lovely, tender moment as she tries to explain sex to him, and Madeline tremblingly reveals her infidelity to her daughter. Most movingly, though, Celeste rents an apartment on the advice of her therapist, and the last brief shot of the episode shows her kneeling on the floor, doubled over, bathed in blue light before a roaring sea. Taking the image as a metaphor, the show’s women are finding themselves increasingly prostrate before their subconscious fears and desires—and next week, at least someone’s going to drown.

This past weekend, the Harvard Student Art Show opened its ninth annual exhibition. On view through April 20 in the Crossings Gallery at the Harvard Ed Portal and Gallery 224 at the Ceramics Program, the show includes works in a variety of media by 38 student artists across six Harvard schools. Eloise A. Lynton ’17 and Diana M. Ingerman ’17 co-directed this year’s exhibition. Grappling with the inherent financial and space challenges of showcasing student art on Harvard’s campus, the pair collaborated with multiple sectors of the University and worked with the College to find the resources for this spring’s show.
According to Lynton and Ingerman, The Harvard Student Art Show is one of the few opportunities for Harvard students to showcase their work in a professional setting. Lynton said that growing the arts community was one of the key intentions of the show. “I think that realizing that people I talk to every day are creating art, and I had no idea, is really exciting and getting to support them is amazing,” she said.
Ingerman elaborated on the submission process. “We had an open call for submissions. Our goal was to sneak into every corner of campus to represent as many people and schools as possible, which was especially important to the Harvard Ed Portal and Ceramics Studio, who have sponsored our whole show and let us use their space,” Ingerman said. Submissions came not only from the College, but also the Graduate School of Design, Extension School, Law School, Business School, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Maia L. Suazo-Maler ’19, who attended the exhibition opening, said she appreciated the breadth of the show. “I thought it was a really cool balance, both of undergrad and grad work, and of static and moving art. They had performance art and also paintings, and photos, and sculptures, and other media,” she said.
Ingerman pointed out that artists at Harvard can have difficulty showcasing their talents for a variety of reasons. “It’s a space, time, money issue,” she said.
Lynton agreed that Harvard would benefit from offering more resources for showcasing student artwork on campus. “I would like to see more student-organized events on campus supporting the arts, because a big part of creating your own art on a college campus is feeling like you have a community that supports you,” she said.
This year, the Harvard Student Art Show collaborated with the Harvard Ed Portal, a community center offering educational opportunities to Allston-Brighton residents of all ages, and the Ceramics Program. This collaboration provided the show with its first professional gallery setting to exhibit works of all media.
Lynton explained how the show originally became involved with the Ed Portal. “They reached out to us asking to collaborate, and we couldn't turn down this amazing space. In the past we’ve been in a hodge podge of spaces like classrooms,” she said. She added that, in addition to the space, the Harvard Ed Portal and Ceramics Program proved to be helpful advisers to the directors and board.
Due to space limitations, not all submissions could be displayed. According to the directors, the board was overwhelmed by the number of submissions received, a total of 300 pieces. In the end, 50 works made the final cut. Instead of centering on a theme, the show endeavored to showcase the most creative of the submissions they received.
Suazo-Maler saw this mission manifest in the works on display. “I thought it was cool to see what people on campus are up to and what they can produce with their creativity,” she said.
Lynton spoke to the progression of the show over the years of its existence on campus. “The Harvard Student Art Show has evolved so much over the past nine years,” Lynton said. “It's grown and grown, and we've tried to take advantage of the trend in the administration of moving towards funding. I think this year legitimizes our organization, because until recently, we weren't officially recognized by the College.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten years after Jay Asher published his novel “13 Reasons Why,” Netflix created a miniseries adaptation of the story, starring Katherine Langford as Hannah Baker, a girl who commits suicide, and Dylan Minnette as Clay Jensen, the boy who finds the thirteen recordings she left behind. Hannah addresses each tape to an individual who pushed her toward her decision. The upsetting tapes have to be passed on to all thirteen people she claims are responsible, or their horrible actions will be exposed to the public by an unknown source. The viewer starts watching when it’s Clay’s turn to listen. With strong efforts by the actors and film editors, the Netflix adaptation succeeds in living up to its predecessor.
In the book, Clay is the protagonist, but in the miniseries, the actors excel in defining minor characters who weren’t as fleshed out in the book. For example, when Kate Walsh plays Hannah’s mother, she is a broken woman. Walsh brings to the screen a deflated posture, an exhausted facial expression, and hollow eyes. Jessica (Alisha Boe) is another reason for Hannah’s death and another recipient of the tapes. She decays throughout the story as she becomes traumatized by her role in Hannah’s suicide and she resorts to desperate means to cope with the truth. And though Minnette does not play a minor character, his performance still fits perfectly into the classic shy-and-awkward teenage boy character as he listens to each tape, trying to find the tape that he’s on, unaware of what he’s done to Hannah.
At first, an hour seems like a lot for each episode, but the show proves its worth by giving each tape enough time for the depth needed to send a message: After a suicide, some of the living affected may want to curl up and ignore reality, the show seems to say. But life has its way of reminding us of the facts and the world around us, as cruel as they may be. For example, in several scenes, Clay almost wants to give up on the recordings, given how emotionally distraught he is. But he keeps going and has to confront the reality of the situation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jean-Michel Billard, better known by his Frodo Baggins-inspired penname Jean-Michel Frodon, started his career as a journalist and film critic in France in the early ’80s. Between 2003 and 2009, he was the chief editor of “Cahiers du Cinema,” the oldest film magazine in publication and one of the most influential ones in the world. Currently a professor at Sciences Po Paris and a writer for slate.fr, Frodon collaborated with Harvard Film Archive to curate its ongoing series, “Contemporary French Alternative.” He talked to The Crimson about his perspective on current cinema.
The Harvard Crimson: The program you helped curate at Harvard Film Archive is called “Contemporary French Alternative,” which of course presumes a certain mainstream in France. What is this mainstream with which you are contrasting these films? How are they different?
Jean-Michel Frodon: There is first a French mainstream cinema, which hopefully you never see here. It’s like any country’s mainstream cinema: formula movies. Then there is what could be called mainstream French auteur films, which are generally speaking great. But the idea is to show more, to show newcomers, people who are not on a regular basis being shown abroad even at festivals. … All the films in the program were released in France between Jan. 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016. In French we have this expression that you extract a carrot from the ground to analyze the composition of the ground. We created this program to testify to the layers that compose the French art cinema of this day.
THC: France has a cultural exception policy in which film, as well as other arts, receives governmental subsidies. There has always been controversy over whether this model protects art from commercial intrusion or makes art more elitist and alienated from the audience. What’s your opinion?
JMF: First, films are not funded by the government. They are supported by money [that the government collects from the revenues of] cinema, television, and now internet companies. The government is active, but this is not taxpayer money. What is acknowledged by the government is that there needs to be a consistent support for an art form to give it opportunities that the market doesn’t.
Then there comes the question about to what extent filmmakers are paying attention to audiences. Art is not made according to the public demand. This is a market approach. Art is meant to create what has not been created, so it’s impossible to expect. If it’s expected, it’s not art. It is industry. It is reproduction of the same things, formula movies, the sequel of a sequel of a sequel, which is the contrary of art. This is not to say the audience doesn’t count. The audience does count. But it counts after.
THC: Do you think the purpose of film, and art in general, is to make a political or social impact, or should it focus on personal expression?
JMF: I think art should escape this binary approach. If something is an artistic work, it does have a political meaning even, or maybe better, when it does not have a political purpose. A work is artistic when it reaches something that echoes with the world we live in, and in this sense has a political stance, whether it’s a painting of flowers or it’s addressing the fight of the workers. It is not the explicit discourse or lack of discourse of the artist that matters. It is whether he or she through artistic endeavor reaches something real.
THC: What do you think of the relationship between film theory and film practice? Would you recommend filmmakers to familiarize themselves with theory?
JMF: I would neither recommend nor not recommend. As we know, some of the best filmmakers never read a book of film theory, and many did read a lot. There is no direct connection and no rule. If there is a rule, it is that filmmakers should learn from watching movies. For those who read film theory, the question is the ability to read and not turn reading into guidelines… to swallow it and make it your own. It is like being fed with intellectual content. Other filmmakers are fed by visual content like paintings and landscape, or listening to music, or falling in love, and it’s as fruitful.
THC: What’s your opinion on virtual reality?
JMF: Honestly I have nothing to say. I have very little experience with VR. I did watch it, but I wasn’t interested. I’ve been seeing technology that is said to revolutionize filmgoing and filmmaking for about 50 years now, and seeing a film in a theater still remains the central experience in the field of cinema. I remember that in the early ’80s there were theme parks where you watched films on moving armchairs, and we were told that of course everyone wanted to be shaken by the armchair according to what’s happening on the screen. But it never became the average way of watching a movie. ... We’ve been told for ages that video games are overcoming cinema, but where is that happening? Of course video games are very much there, but they did not dismiss the joy of sitting in the dark in the theatre. Both are acceptable. They cohabit.
THC: Latin American cinema has shown impressive vitality in the last few years, and some of the most original recent films come from that continent. Do you think Latin America represents the future of world cinema?
JMF: It’s very interesting what’s going on in Latin America, because it doesn’t fit with the usual pattern of the operation of a new film movement. Usually it comes from a country with a few leading filmmakers who embody this movement. This is what happened in Taiwan, in Iran, in mainland China, and it happened already in Argentina at the beginning of the 21st century. Now, what we see in Latin America is interesting films popping up all over the continent, from Mexico to the south of Chile. You have difficulty naming directors, because there’s no leading figure. Probably now the country that is the most creative is Colombia, but neither you nor me could name one great director. I don’t know what to say beyond that, because on one hand it can be a good thing not to rely on two or three leading figures, but on the other hand it can be more fragile.

“Prevenge” is not your average slasher film. Starring Alice Lowe, who is also the film’s writer and director, the British black comedy features a pregnant widow out to kill those who were involved in the accident that claimed her husband’s life. As if this concept weren’t unusual enough, there’s also a twist: Ruth, the protagonist, is being guided in her rampage by her unborn daughter. That’s right, the mastermind behind her killing spree is a surprisingly articulate fetus.
It’s hard to argue with the fetus when the world Ruth lives in is so full of truly awful human beings. At first, one could say that she is simply attempting to make the world a better place for her future child. She kills an absolute creep of a pet store owner, a disgusting dive bar DJ, and a corporate drone who refuses to hire her because she’s pregnant. As the movie continues, however, Ruth’s murders become less justifiable. The fetus, rather than coming across as a force of righteous vengeance, shows itself as a sort of primordial hatred—it even quotes Aeschylus’s “Eumenides” to drive this point home. Ruth and her child disagree at times, but it never lasts long. The fetus always gets its way. As Ruth says, “Children these days are really spoiled.”
“Prevenge” is filled with gems like the line above, making full use of the endless aphorisms around birth and motherhood to play with double meanings. The film is billed as a black comedy, but much of the humor is absurdist, more intended to make the audience uncomfortably reflective.
Still, there are some laugh-out-loud moments. In one scene, Ruth pretends to be going door-to-door for charity in an effort to get inside the home of one of her victims, a woman named Len (Gemma Whelan, better known for her role as Yara on “Game of Thrones”). While she threatens Len, the target protests that she already gives to charity. “What do you think this is, like some kind of new initiative?”
In addition to comedy, “Prevenge” stays true to its slasher roots. There is plenty of gore, from slit throats to bashed-in skulls to, memorably, castration. Most scenes occur at night, with harsh, artificial lighting that emphasizes Ruth’s alienation from everyone around her. All the day scenes are cloudy and oppressively grey. The soundtrack is synth-heavy and reminiscent of Nicolas Winding-Refn’s iconic backing tunes. Overall, the effect of the film’s visual and audio style is to isolate Ruth in her journey, even from the audience. Lowe wants her only partner to be her unborn child.

Spanish science-fiction director Nacho Vigalondo’s Hollywood debut “Colossal” bites off more than it can chew. The darkly comical Godzilla reimagination tries to be a movie about emotional abuse, and alcoholism, and imperialism, and elitism. It is at once a comedy, a thriller, and sci-fi, as well as a part-time romance. The problem is, when it tries to be good at everything, it falls short in mostly everything. The film relies on the sort of idiosyncratic, quirky fun that cannot sustain an entire movie. When it’s time to get serious, the fun energy peters out, leaving a film that tries to be bigger than it is.
"Colossal" tells the story of Gloria (Anne Hathaway, whose bangs get progressively frizzier), an alcoholic, thirty-something human tornado residing in her boyfriend’s apartment. Her life is as messy as it is glamorous: She has friends named “Oasis” and parties at the Loft until sunrise. But her hard-partying lifestyle grinds to a halt when Tim, her boyfriend (a very exasperated and very British Dan Stevens) finally evicts her. Gloria seeks refuge in her suburban hometown, where she reunites with Oscar (Jason Sudeikis), a childhood friend who now runs a local bar where Gloria becomes a waitress. Just as Gloria adjusts to her new life, the world is shaken by the catastrophic news that a giant monster has started appearing in downtown Seoul, South Korea, and terrorizing citizens every night at the same time. After watching news coverage and connecting a few dots, Gloria realizes that her behavior is directly tied to the appearance of the monster, and she commands remote-control power from thousands of miles away. The story grows even more complicated when she realizes someone else wields the same ability.
As Gloria, Anne Hathaway delivers a resonant portrayal of a millennial woman caught in the throes of alcoholism, grappling with the reality of her own personal setbacks, and confronted with the sudden pressure of having to play God. She can barely be responsible for herself, let alone an entire city’s population. Her storyline is like a Cinderella story, only instead of rags to riches, the film tracks her arc from chaotic neutral to lawful good. The crux of Hathaway’s dynamic performance lies in Gloria’s simmering frustration at the guys in her life. They try to play her like a puppet, making her do a million paradoxical things at once under the guise of wanting what’s best for her. They try to make her drink, then stop drinking. They encourage her to get control of her life, but then chastise her for achieving self-sufficiency.
The master puppeteer is Oscar, played by Sudeikis in an impressive departure from his normal comedic roles. Wearing the hats of both Jekyll and Hyde, Sudeikis’ Oscar is a multifaceted look into the frightening ethos of the Nice Guy. Having stayed in their Podunk hometown for his entire life, Oscar develops an inferiority complex toward Gloria and the urban fairy-tale life she seems to lead. “Somebody actually made it out of here and did something special,” he says to Gloria, smiling, but his eyes convey less admiration than jealousy and resentment.
In the wake of Oscar and Gloria’s personal woes, the world disaster feels like a footnote, marginalia scribbled in the negative space of Vigalondo’s screenplay. There’s something distinctly unsettling about the fact that the film focuses on Gloria’s personal issues when her drunken mishaps have a body count: the senseless, tragic death of hundreds of innocent Koreans. “That’s a shame,” Gloria observes as news anchors read the body counts. “If the monster’s only attacking Seoul, the rest of the world will stop caring.” Unsurprisingly, we already have.
Perhaps the imbalance is owing partially to the film’s lackluster visual effects and uninspiring screenplay. Though it has a higher budget than any of Vigalondo’s past films, the special effects—the monster appearing in Seoul, the ensuing action scenes—do not quite meet mainstream CGI standards. And with the exception of a few delightful one-liners, Vigalondo’s dialogue feels underwhelming and artificial, with punchlines verging on the predictable.
Despite compelling performances from Hathaway and Sudeikis, “Colossal” feels like a larger-than-life commentary unnecessarily embroiled in polemics. The film has its moments, but one wonders whether it ought to pick on something—well, its own size.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I don’t like being called biracial.
People are confused when I tell them that I’m black. They point to my mother and say “Isn’t this white woman your mother, as much as that black man is your father?” I respond, “She is. And yet, I am black, and I am not white.”
These interrogators (usually white people) are shocked. “How are you any less her? Don’t you love her? How can you throw her aside?” They see my rejection of whiteness as unnatural, and untrue. They think that in foregoing whiteness, I am denying myself.
What they don’t understand is that rejecting biracialism for blackness is the truest and most authentic thing I have ever done. After years of confusion and deep-seated existential angst, I feel that I have found myself.
Growing up, I was taught (by the individuals and institutions around me) that I was something different, that the fact that my mother was white and my father black changed some essential fact about who I was. I thought that I was neither fully my father nor fully my mother. Any child becomes conceptualized and formed as a fusion between two people, a “mix” of their parents. So I was taught that I had my father’s smile and my mother’s taste in music, his Jamaican aesthetics and her Italian palate. And I was taught that I had her whiteness, and his blackness.
This was never explicit, merely understood. I was pushed into a Twilight Zone. The two sides of the world both staked their claim on me. Kids at school asked me if I “could jump.”  I told teachers that I wasn’t black. Adults asked my mother if I was adopted. I thought hip hop was “for other people.” I would spend hours in Caribbean hair salons getting my locs retwisted.
In the wake of these divergent experiences, I embraced biracialism, thinking it was the only identity that could sum up my fragmented experience. I refused to call myself black because, I reasoned, my life simply wasn’t black—or at least, not just black.
But as I grew up and into the world, I realized that my “dual citizenship” was missing something. Boys at school would make fun of my locs—my high school made me cut them off because “they didn’t fit dress code.” I heard teachers mock Trayvon Martin, and remind me that “I’m one of the good ones.” I watched the inauguration of President Barack Obama, and heard the comments of white people scared of shifting tides. “America is falling, because they—the same they that plagues our cities, that murders our children, and spoils our pristine culture—are winning.”
Then someone called me a n***er for the first time.
I learned that being black meant being a n***er, and this was a conception of my body and my space that carried with it massive existential weight. It wasn’t something that could be “mixed.” One can’t be a “half n***er.” One either experiences the weight of the world, or one does not. And I learned that I did.
How, in this world, can one occupy white space and black space in the same body? If I claimed biracialism, if I claimed that I could be one and the other, it seemed that I was denying a fundamental fact of what it is to exist as one or the other. I wanted to be of my mother and my father, but I realized that I could not be both. To live as white is, fundamentally, to live as not-black, and vice versa.
My identity crumbled beneath me. Biracialism was a nonstarter—it rejected the truth of my existence. But I knew I had to take a stand. I knew I couldn’t reside in nothingness, in a vacuum of identity. So I moved forward, into blackness.
My decision to claim blackness was thus personal and political. It is a personal relation and reaction to the political reality of wearing a black skin in this country. But this is not a helpless acceptance, because with trauma and pain come hope and redemption. I embrace blackness, hungrily and without compromise. I understand now that I can only hope to build myself up by resting on solid ground. My blackness is more than my body. It is my glory, it is my embrace of all that makes my community what it is—the generational trauma and the cultural beauty. I embrace blackness because I am nothing without it, for better or worse.
I do not mean by this to command all people identifying as biracial to abandon their identity; I simply mean to outline my own unique experience. And I do not mean to deny my own personal history. I do not abandon my mother and her influence on me by embracing blackness. I am my mother’s son, and I am beyond proud to be so. But we both know that I will never be her, and she will never be me. I will not run from that. I will embrace it. And thus I will move forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many members of the Harvard community, the Gender Violence Legal Policy Workshop at the Law School was deeply disturbed by the 2015 American Association of Universities report disclosing the widespread sexual abuse that takes place at Harvard. While initially grateful that the College appeared to have taken affirmative steps to address this issue through its proposed sanctions on single-gender social organizations, we were dismayed to learn that sexual assault prevention is no longer the driving force behind the sanctions.
Though the administration may have initially had worthwhile motivations, we are discouraged that they appear to be shifting their views in order to make the policy more palatable to faculty. Further, asserting that the staggering sexual assault statistics were not the impetus for the sanctions minimizes the very real harms that 25.5 percent of women polled in the AAU survey have experienced. Finally, we are concerned that if the sanctions were not created to combat sexual assault, then what, if any, affirmative steps has Harvard taken since the AAU report was released?
As was previously reported by The Crimson, the implementation committee’s report mentioned “sexual assault” or “sexual violence” only four times in a 46 page document, and failed to mention “rape” at all. Similarly, the compliance agreements that students will be required to sign also fail to mention sexual assault. Students will be asked to affirm that they are not members of a social organization that discriminates on the basis of gender.
However, they will not be asked anything about whether their social organization promotes sexual respect and sexual safety or conducts sexual assault awareness trainings, nor will they be asked to affirm or abide by Harvard College’s rules on sexual assault.  Forcing organizations to become co-ed cannot alone protect women from the realities of campus sexual assault, particularly when the co-ed punch dynamic for final clubs is that of younger women trying to please older men in order to access the social capital enjoyed by these male-dominated institutions.
Harvard must take affirmative steps to ensure students’ safety beyond implementing sanctions and hoping this problem goes away. Effective sanctions must be tailored to the problem of sexual violence. We recommend that Harvard create an exception that allows for single-sex organizations to operate if they can show a sufficient commitment to gender equality, inclusion, respect, and prevention of sexual violence. Further, Harvard must impose similar sanctions on students found responsible for sexual misconduct but who are not part of a single-sex organization.
In addition, sexual assault training must be annual, formalized across the Houses, and made a priority on campus. Specific precautions should be taken to protect newly admitted female students to historically male organizations. The sanctions should be continuously evaluated to ensure that the desired deterrent effect occurs. But this is only the beginning of the fight against sexual assault. Harvard must take steps to encourage an atmosphere of sexual respect on campus. As privileged citizens of the Harvard community, we must consistently strive to build interpersonal relationships that are firmly rooted in principles of gender equality, bodily integrity, and sexual respect. Together we have the power to challenge, shape, and change our community in furtherance of these goals.
The administration has announced that there will be a three to five year bridge period in which all-female social organizations may operate without being sanctioned. The specificity of this time period leads us to suspect that the College is taking advantage of short institutional memory to slowly phase out female clubs without addressing the historic underrepresentation of female power in the Harvard social scene. We hope instead that this is the beginning of a recognition of the value of female-centered spaces and their importance in helping students feel safe and respected on campus.
Harvard must embrace student voices during this period, particularly those of women and sexual minorities who will be most affected by any broad-based gender exclusivity rules. Rather than waiting three years for dissenting voices to graduate, Harvard should have a robust conversation about the past, present, and future of gender inequality on campus, including, of course, sexual assault.  Sexual assault is gender inequality in its most extreme form, and Harvard will not make any real progress towards gender equality while continuing to turn a blind eye to the sexual assault crisis on campus. We urge the administration to engage with students and discuss what they think would be most effective in preventing sexual assault on campus.
Under Title IX, Harvard must ensure equal access to education for all of its students. Access to education cannot be equal when instances of gender-based violence occur in staggering numbers all over campus, and especially in male final clubs. Accordingly, Harvard must take further steps to address the pervasive issues of rape and sexual assault, well beyond the proposed sanctions. In deemphasizing Harvard’s sexual assault problem, the administration steers the campus further from its admirable goals of gender equity and equal opportunity.  If the College fails to take meaningful steps toward the prevention of rape and sexual assault on campus, the social hierarchies that perpetuate sexual violence will only grow further entrenched.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 23, 2016, the General Assembly of North Carolina passed the now-infamous House Bill 2 in response to a Charlotte ordinance extending various rights—in particular the right for individuals to use the public restroom that corresponds to their gender identity—to transgender persons. House Bill 2 overturned Charlotte’s ordinance by obligating North Carolinians to use the bathroom that corresponds to their birth certificate. It also forbade local governments from expanding upon state anti-discrimination laws and criteria. This appalling legislation was met with widespread condemnation from sports leagues and corporations, costing North Carolina approximately $3.76 billion.
This past week, in response to an NCAA ultimatum to repeal H.B. 2 or renounce hosting rights until 2022, the Republican-controlled state legislature finally decided to work with recently-elected Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, passing a compromise measure to repeal the core of H.B. 2. We are heartened to witness compromise in these hyper-partisan times, in regard to both the motivation behind the repeal as well as the repeal’s actual content, but we do not think this particular compromise is sufficient.
First, it was only with the external pressure of a potential economic loss and further damage  to North Carolina’s marred reputation that Republican legislators finally budged on the bill. Though we commend the NCAA and other businesses for seeking to place pressure on the state legislature,  we are generally wary of an inordinate corporate influence on state politics. We believe that state legislators should be motivated by the principles of equality and respect for the constituents who have elected them into office, rather than the petrifying fear of being left out of March Madness for a few years. It is demeaning and incensing that the rights of transgender persons have been treated merely as bartering chips in a corporate tango. We hope that the NCAA reacts in a way that is in line with the principles it has previously established for itself, rather than rewarding this shallow, calculating move.
Moreover, the repeal measure is only partial, and retains many of H.B. 2’s core tenets. For example, it still prohibits local governments from passing anti-discrimination measures, in effect maintaining a moratorium on civil rights for various identifications, and also reserves the right of regulating multi-stall public bathrooms for the state legislature, leaving North Carolinians at the whim of another Republican power-grab. Governor Roy Cooper has acknowledged as much, conceding that in an ideal world,  “[North Carolina] would have repealed House Bill 2 fully today and added full statewide protections for LGBT North Carolinians.” Though we acknowledge the difficulty of Cooper’s undertaking—previous attempts to fully repeal H.B. 2 have fallen flat—we believe that the repeal is so diluted as to hardly deserve celebration.
Indeed, the new legislation does not address the core issues surrounding H.B. 2. The policy was an egregious infringement on the rights of transgender people, and fully merited the denunciation it garnered. While the partial repeal has made it so H.B. 2 is no longer the law of North Carolina, this is not enough. The General Assembly of North Carolina has once again shown its general disregard for basic human rights of an at-risk population within the state, and North Carolina will be worse for it.

It was a battle to the death––two rivals, face-to-face, eternal fame and glory up for grabs. At this year’s Harvard Certamen, the pinnacle of Latin Quiz Bowl achievement, high school teams converged upon the Harvard Colosseum, known colloquially as “Sever Room 103.” Months of intense off-season training had honed these titans of trivia into mean, lean, quizzing machines. After a contested drachma toss, the games began.
The most shocking upset of the day came during the heavily anticipated matchup between the defending hometown champs, the Allston Spartans, and the underdogs, the East Bridgewater Minotaurs.
Despite an early-season thumb injury that had sidelined their MVP, the Spartans took a slight lead. Clinging to a 5-4 lead with seven minutes left in the round, they backed the Minotaurs against a wall, trapping them in a maze of unparalleled Latin quiz knowledge.
The game was over, right? Wrong!
Spectators held their breath as the Spartans delivered an answer containing the incorrect second-person plural imperfect passive conjugation of dūcēminī. With the Spartans on the ropes, the Minotaurs capitalized on this novice mistake and snagged a last minute comeback with the answer “pyrrhic victory.” The roaring crowd––three Latin instructors and James F. Nelson ’18’s seventh grade brother––went wild.
“The Minotaurs performed today like they do every day in practice,” East Bridgewater coach Janet Peterson said. “There’s no substitute for grit, mental willpower, and a vast knowledge of Ovid. We’re off to celebrate with some Felipe’s and a sacrifice to Cronus.”
In the end, the Latin knowledge gleaned and camaraderie built throughout the day’s festivities made every participant a winner. Except for the Allston Spartans. They were fed to the lions.

Mary Maples Dunn, who took the helm of Radcliffe during its 1999 merger with Harvard, died March 19. She was 85.
When Dunn took over as acting dean of what was then the brand-new Radcliffe Institute, she had to navigate a unique transition—shifting the all-female Radcliffe College, focused on educating undergraduate women, to an institute now dedicated to research and advanced study.
The Crimson reported at the time that many welcomed Dunn’s leadership. She had spent decades in academia focused on educating women, with leadership posts at Bryn Mawr and a decade spent as president of Smith College. She also served as the head of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.
Dunn told The Crimson that attending Bryn Mawr, a women’s college, for her graduate education opened her eyes to “an unreal kind of world.”
“I was in a place that was pretty much run by women and for women,” Dunn said.
Dunn was born in 1931 in Sturgeon Bay, Wis. The daughter of a homemaker and a haberdasher, Dunn went off to the College of William and Mary to study history at a time when many southern schools remained segregated.
Shortly before she became interim dean of Radcliffe at age 68, Dunn suffered a heart attack and underwent bypass surgery. But that was not enough to stop her from taking on a critical role in a decisive moment of Radcliffe history.
“She was so widely liked and respected that she was kind of an emollient in the midst of the controversy surrounding the transition,” University President Drew G. Faust told the Harvard Gazette.
Faust was a student of Dunn’s at Bryn Mawr, and told the Gazette that Dunn was one of her favorite teachers. Faust succeeded her as president of the Institute in 2001. That year, Dunn was awarded the Radcliffe Medal.
Lizabeth Cohen, the current dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, wrote in an email that she first met Dunn when she was director of the Schlesinger Library.
“I was impressed with the energy and vision Mary was bringing to the Library,” Cohen wrote, adding that she was “relieved” to hear Dunn would be heading the merger as acting dean.
Cohen wrote that Dunn led with “a sparkling personality and a twinkling eye.”
“She was a rare treasure,” Cohen added.
According to the New York Times, Dunn is survived by her husband, Richard S. Dunn—who is also a historian—two daughters, a brother, and three grandchildren.
The Radcliffe Institute will hold a memorial service for Dunn at the Knafel Center on April 8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A panel aimed at helping service providers to Allston and Brighton immigrants respond to President Donald Trump’s recent immigration policies convened last Thursday to inform immigrant advocates of correct information and resources.
The panel, staffed by attorneys and professionals involved in immigrant advocacy, featured presentations on understanding the deportation process, identifying scams and misinformation provided to immigrants, and directing constituents to appropriate immigration resources. Approximately 25 service providers—in industries like childcare, education, and health care—attended the event.
Jo-Ann Barbour, Executive Director of Charlesview Inc., a community housing nonprofit in Allston-Brighton, organized the event.
“We thought it was important to provide a forum for primarily service providers, people who are working with immigrants and their families, so that we could all get the same information and be on the same page,” she said.
Of the 22 neighborhoods in Boston, Allston comes eighth highest by foreign-born population at 25.4 percent, and Brighton comes eleventh highest at 23.8 percent, according to a 2015 survey by the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
Barbour said Charlesview residents often voice concerns about their extended family members to her.
“I’m hearing more and more about fear of traveling. Indeed, the folks at the forum said probably not a good idea to travel even in country, never mind going out of country,” Barbour said.
She added: “The fears are real.”
Barbour said immigrant families can be afraid to get health care, despite the fact that health clinics provide care regardless of immigration status.
“Allston and Brighton is a welcoming community and we’ll do everything that we can to assist families that need to get engaged with services and programs,” Barbour said.
Boston's Department of Immigration Advancement has reported an increase in the number of requests for their services since Trump has taken office. An J. Le, policy and communications advisor for the department, said he has been conducting an analysis of constituents’ requests to the Department of Immigrant Advancement.
“We tracked phone calls, walk-ins, emails, folks who came to our office directly, and to the mayor, which gets routed to our office,” Le said. “In the last three months, it’s gone up by 65 percent, compared to the calendar year of 2016.”
The department also holds bi-monthly immigration consultation clinics with volunteer lawyers, which Le said have also seen a significant growth in attendance.
Lifetime Brighton resident Charlie Vasiliades said one of the things he cherishes about his neighborhood is its “multi-ethnic home ownership.”
He added that immigrants have positively contributed to building a sense of community in Allston and Brighton.
“What people perceive as a threat, frankly, is absentee owners buying property and filling them with transient young people, students, who pass through,” he said.
Panel participants included Jessica Chicco, an attorney with the Post-Deportation Human Rights Project at Boston College Law School; Sarah Aller, the Immigration Services Coordinator at Allston Brighton Community Development; Carol Q. León from the Mayor's Office for Immigrant Advancement; Andrew P. Cohen from Health Law Advocates; and Marcony Almeida-Barros from the Attorney General’s Community Engagement Division.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An alumni coalition focused on increasing diversity at Harvard endorsed five candidates in this year’s Board of Overseers election and four alumni vying for an elected director position on the Board of the Harvard Alumni Association.
The alumni group—dubbed the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard—was formed last year in opposition to a controversial slate of candidates that ran under the two-pronged platform of abolishing tuition at the University and advocating more transparency in the undergraduate admissions process.
None of the members of the slate, which included former presidential candidate Ralph Nader and conservative provocateur Ron K. Unz ’83, won spots on the Board of Overseers.
Though this year’s election does not feature any outsider candidates, the Coalition still endorsed five of the eight individuals nominated by the Alumni Association for the Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body.
The 30-member Board of Overseers works with the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, to advise the University President on major institutional decisions. Its members serve for six-year terms, and Harvard degree holders vote every spring to elect five new members.
The Coalition threw its support behind the following candidates: Darienne B. Driver, Paul L. Choi ’86, Carla Harris ’84, Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar ’93, and Leslie P. Tolbert ’73. The group also endorsed four candidates for elected director of the Board of the Harvard Alumni Association: Nathaniel Q.  Belcher ’92, Paola A. Peacock Friedrich, Sangu J. Delle ’10, Sachin H. Jain ’02.
Tolbert, one of the nominees for an Overseers position and a professor at the University of Arizona, wrote that she was “delighted” to receive the endorsement.
“Throughout my academic career I have championed diversity among students and faculty and staff,” she wrote in an email. “Working with Harvard as a member of the Board of Overseers would give me a chance to help expand opportunities for success at Harvard, at the same time broadening the scope of the academic conversation.”
A candidate for an elected director position, Delle said he is committed to “playing [his] role to make sure that Harvard continues to be a welcoming place and an inclusive place.
Delle referenced Harvard’s admissions and financial aid program—one of the most expansive amongst higher education institutions in the nation—as a point of focus in his candidacy.
“I’ve been volunteering with the capital campaign for financial aid, and that’s one of the key things,” Delle said. “To try and make sure that when we talk about diversity, we’re including socioeconomic diversity, making sure that we have people from the most marginalized groups. I think it’s important.”
Ballots for the election were sent to Harvard degree holders at the start of the month, and must be returned to the Harvard Alumni Association by May 16 to be counted.

The Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to provide funds to subsidize peer counseling groups’ meals during Opening Days this year, fulfilling a campaign promise of UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18.
The UC will distribute a $2,000 grant across Room 13, Contact, Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors, Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, Response, and Indigo. Members of these student groups return from summer break during Opening Days in order to train before offering counseling for the full year, according to Sachee.
“Every year, these groups come back to campus early to go through training for a week before school starts. And they do this so that they can start all their programs the minute students get to campus, so they can service the students for the entire year,” she said.
Sachee said that last year, members of the groups that came back to campus received no funds for food during Opening Week.
“When they come back to campus in the first week last year, they did not have access to dining halls and they weren’t given any food [provided by the College],” Sachee said.
Sachee said discussions between herself and mental health groups began in the fall before she became UC President. During Sachee and Khansarinia’s campaign, the duo prioritized improving mental health services by working on “things we actually have control over.”
Khansarinia said he and Sachee began working with administrators from Harvard University Health Services in February to locate funding sources for the meals.
“It wasn't really important for us if it came from us or if it came from them,” he said.
The UC voted to fund the grant as part of the Grant for an Open Harvard College—a $30,000 student initiative fund. While the grant will go towards funding meals for members of the groups this year, Sachee and Khansarinia said they hope the College will pay for it in the future.
“We also have been talking with the College to see if there’s a way if they can foot the bill there, as well. What we have to remember is this is not something the college has funded in the past, this would be a new addition to their budget and so obviously there would have to be things that have to be worked out there,” Sachee said.

Cambridge City Councillors passed a resolution Monday urging the House of Representatives to begin an investigation into President Donald Trump’s potential violations of the Constitution and decide if grounds exist to impeach him.
The resolution asks the House of Representatives’ Judiciary Committee to determine whether or not Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by possibly profiting from his business empire while in the White House.
“There are numerous examples of Trump’s many businesses having dealings with foreign governments," Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern said. “This order was filed because we’re concerned President Donald Trump has violated the Constitution.”
Trump is unique among modern presidents for maintaining substantial business holdings while in office, and although he has signed them over to a blind trust run by his sons, critics say he has not fully divested from his companies.
Multiple Cambridge residents spoke in favor of the resolution, which was sponsored by local activist group Cambridge Area Stronger Together, McGovern, Councillor Leland Cheung, and Councillor Jan Devereux.
Some residents said they thought the resolution was outside of the Council's scope and that there were more pressing issues to be dealt with, but Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, who has spoken out against Trump’s actions in the past, disagreed. Instead, he said he thought the job of the Council to champion the voice of the people and urge action on a federal level.
“I think we’re doing it because we do think we can have an impact. And because the people of this city can go on to spread the message,” Mazen said. “It’s our way as a Council to say we will stand against you.”
At the meeting, Councillors also praised the work done by various city groups on a newly passed Inclusionary Housing Zoning Ordinance. The ordinance requires new housing developments to dedicate 15 to 20 percent of their housing floor space to affordable housing, depending on the type of permit.
Councillor Devereux said the ordinance was a positive step forward and should serve as a stepping stone towards continuing to address the City’s housing challenges by creating new affordable housing for low income residents.“I hope that we do as people have advised us, which is to take up the next challenges: help middle income families or people who are in the gaps,” Devereux said. “
Also at the meeting, Councillors discussed more than $5 million in renovations to a housing facility on Massachusetts Ave., regulations for adding traffic signage around the City, and a police substation in Central square. Cheung also presented a report on changing city ordinance to allow victims of last December’s 10 alarm fire to rebuild the original structures, even if they don’t conform to current code.

After months of negotiations, Harvard and a union representing Harvard University Police Department officers have agreed on a new contract that grants pay increases for union members and adds them to the University’s health care plans.
The new contract includes wage increases of 3 percent per year for Harvard University Police Association members, and a transition from the union health care plan to the University’s Active and Post Retiree health plans. The union’s old contract expired on November 30, 2016. The contract will last for four years.
“Harvard’s police officers play an important role in support of the University’s teaching and research mission, and we are pleased to have reached an agreement with Harvard University Police Association,” University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement. “We believe that this agreement serves the interests of both the represented employees as well as that of the University.”
HUPA members, too, said the new contract met their needs.
“It took a little time but both sides are, I think, happy with it,” Michael Allen, president of HUPA, said. “It took a little time but I think it’s a fair contract on both sides and our membership overwhelmingly approved it, so that makes me happy.”
HUPA and the University reached a contract agreement on March 10, and the union ratified the contract on March 21. At the ratification meeting, all 30 union members who voted approved the contract. HUPA needed a simple majority of its 59 members to vote for the contract in order to adopt it. Some members were unable to attend the meeting and cast a vote because of their work schedules.
HUPA’s contract comes after a series of contract negotiations between the University and its unions. In February, Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards Union also ratified a new contract. That contract granted guard union members a 3.14 percent increase in average annualized wages and acceptance of the University’s Active and Post Retiree health plans.
In November, Harvard University Dining Services workers, represented by UNITE HERE LOCAL 26, went on a historic strike for 22 days. Their new contract includes retroactive 2.5 percent wage increases and will transition members of the union to Harvard’s Active and Post Retiree health plans starting in 2019.
Weeks after the HUDS strike, Harvard’s custodial workers, represented by 32BJ SEIU, and the University reached an agreement guaranteeing union members a 12.5 percent pay increase over the course of their four-year contract.

Kevin Tian, a graduate student in applied physics, and Aric Flemming, a graduate student at the Divinity School, were elected President and Vice-President of the Harvard Graduate Council at the body’s Monday meeting.
Members of the Council elected Tian and Flemming along with five other students to the body’s executive board. They will begin their roles on April 17, and replace outgoing Council President Peter J. Dyrud and Vice-President Simeon Bochev.
Tian has served on the Council since 2014. During his candidacy speech, he emphasized the importance of outreach and student unity and his previous experience on the council.
“I vow to constantly listen for new opportunities to improve the student body, to improve upon engagement and getting everyone to know what HGC is,” said Tian, who gained 7 out of 11 votes cast by representatives to the Council. “I really believe in this vision, because being stuck in the engineering school, being stuck in lab, you don’t really see a lot of people with different viewpoints.”
Flemming, meanwhile, spoke of his background as a seminarian at Memorial Church and leading congregations as valuable experience for his position.
“My primary vocation before entering graduate school was serving as a pastor in one of the largest churches in Atlanta of a congregation of about 10,000 people,” Flemming said.  He added that his profession gave him experience in “working with a lot of different issues, and people from all over."
Tracie Gordon, Samuel Pun, Payum Noshiravan, Natalie Wang, and Akinwande Lalude were also elected to the executive board.
The Council’s representatives are chosen by each of the twelve graduate schools’ student bodies.  Each graduate school is permitted one vote on issues before the Council.
During the first half of the meeting, HGC also unanimously voted to approve changes to its bylaws and constitution that clarified its election procedures.
In particular, the Council adopted language to reflect that only students in a “degree program” could hold positions on the body, to distinguish from students participating in a certificate or non-degree program at the Extension School.
The body also adopted an amendment stating that candidates for an executive board position must win a majority of votes to be elected, even if they are running uncontested.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team was kept busy this weekend with four different regattas across New England. The team hosted the Central Series III, as well as sent sailors to the Lynne Marchiando Trophy Team Race hosted by MIT, the Dellenbaugh Women’s Trophy hosted by Brown, and the BU Trophy.
The Crimson struggled in the rough weather conditions on Saturday. The team ultimately finished in the bottom half of the teams in all their regattas.
“I think we all knew we didn't perform our best this weekend,” freshman Jessica Williams said.  “But we're taking it as a learning opportunity and a chance to pinpoint our weaknesses before the [NEISA] qualifiers.”
LYNNE MARCHIANDO TROPHY TEAM RACE
Harvard claimed tenth place out of the 16 teams racing in Fireflies and FJs on the Charles River at the Lynne Marchiando Regatta, going 9-5 in its Round Robin match ups. Dartmouth placed first, losing only two of its 12 match ups, for an 85.7 percent winning percentage. Yale University and Boston College came in 2nd and 3rd, respectively.
Racing started late on Saturday due to turbulent weather conditions, including wind, snow, rain, and, at times, hail. Three Harvard pairs braved the conditions: junior Kevin Coakley and sophomore Nick Karnovsky, junior Nick Sertl and senior Nomin Jagdagdorj, and sophomore Nick DiGiovanni and senior Priscilla Russo.
The teams started off strong, going 6-1 in the first round of the Round Robin, with the only loss coming at the hands of hosts MIT.
The second round presented more of a challenge for the Crimson, as it went 3-4, despite defeating Brown, Rhode Island, and Boston University.
CENTRAL SERIES III
After finishing 14th out of 18 teams at the Central Series II on March 25, Harvard came up with an eleventh place finish out of 16 teams competing in FJs on the Charles River. Races on Saturday were cancelled because of strong winds and cold temperatures, but conditions on Sunday made for a good afternoon of sailing, with lots of sun and a shifty N/NE breeze that dwindled by the end of the day.
In the A division, freshmen Sofia Mascia and Amalia Frohna held their own, finishing toward the middle of the pack in five of their six races, in addition to a third place finish in the last race for a total of 54 points and 10th place in the division. Sunday was Frohna’s third regatta in her sailing career, as she walked onto the sailing team in the fall.
“We had a really good weekend of development and getting used to racing together,” Mascia said. “We’re looking to race together in the future.”
Mascia and Frohna’s counterparts in the B division were junior Ben Zheng and freshman Juan Crestanello, who split time at skipper, with freshman Tancredi Castellano-Pucci at crew. The sailors finished 11th out of the 16 teams, failing to place in the top eight in all but the first of their six races, where they came in 6th.
Together, the two pairs collected a total of 116 points.
“Amalia and I are looking to improve on our starts and getting around the course more easily so that we can think more about tactics instead of boat handling” Mascia said. “I think the same goes for the sailors in Division B.”
The Central Series III was dominated by Boston College, whose A and B division teams combined for 45 points and nine first place finishes in twelve races.
DELLENBAUGH WOMEN’S TROPHY
Roughing rainy, bitterly cold conditions, including winds of up to 25 knots on Saturday, the Crimson managed to finish 12th out of the 18 teams competing at Edgewood Yacht Club in Providence for the Dellenbaugh Women’s Trophy.
The brutal weather forced racing to end early on Saturday, but teams were still able to get in a few races before continuing on Sunday, in much warmer and sunnier conditions. Sailing in Z420s, the two Crimson pairs combined for a score of 169 points, markedly behind the top score of 46 points from the hosts, Brown.
“In conditions like that where it's freezing cold and large gusts and it becomes hard to stay in control of the boat, it's easy to slip into a ‘survival mode,’” Williams said. “Everyone else on the course has to deal with the same conditions, so we just had to make the best of it.”
Williams and sophomore skipper Taylor Gavula battled the conditions in the first five races in the B division, after which senior Emma Wheeler took Williams’ place as crew for the remainder of the day. The Crimson placed 10th with 79 points and two top five finishes.
The A division team of juniors Taylor Ladd and Kristin Anderson finished in 11th place with 90 points after a mixed performance. The duo won one of their eight races outright, but did not finish their third race.
BU TROPHY
The Crimson’s best result of the weekend came at the BU Trophy, where it placed eighth out of the thirteen teams competing in the in-conference regatta. Tufts University came away with first place, with an especially dominant performance in the B division, where its pair of sailors finished in the top five in each of their six races.
Harvard, on the other hand, only had one top five finish in the B division, as the pair of freshman Catherine Kerner and sophomore Catherine Tang finished toward the bottom of pack in five of their six races for a total of 55 points. To put this in perspective, the Tufts A and B division teams scored a cumulative total 54 points to win the regatta.
The Crimson’s other duo of freshman Lucy Wilmot and sophomore Alejandra Resendiz fared much better, earning third place in a close A division competition. After crossing the finish line last in their first race, the pair bounced back to win the second race outright. They notched eighth, fourth, and eighth place finishes again in their next three races, then ended the day strong on a strong note with another first place finish.
The success of the A division pair could be attributed to the team’s hard work over Spring Break. “We’ve seen a lot of improvement since our Spring Break training trip [to California],” Mascia explained.
Over break, the Crimson sailed in the San Francisco Bay Area, at times even practicing with the Stanford University Sailing Team.
Wilmot and Resendiz’ 35 points, combined with the 55 from Kerner and Tang brought the Crimson to a total of 90 points and eighth place, a step up from last year when the team finished 9th in the same regatta.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering its second tournament of the spring season, the Harvard women’s golf team traveled down to Osprey, Fla. to participate in the Ivy-heavy Harvard Invitational. Hosted by the team on the 72-par, three round Heron Course at the Oaks Club, the tournament took place over the course of Saturday and Sunday.
In the field of eight, the Crimson took third place, behind only Princeton, who finished 30 above par, and Boston University, who finished two strokes behind. Over the course of the three rounds the five person Harvard women’s team finished with 905 strokes, 41 strokes over par and 11 above the first place Tigers.
Highlighting for the Crimson was sophomore Michelle Xie. Finishing third place in the Ivy League Championships last year, the sophomore was in a field of her own this weekend, not just leading Harvard but defeating the rest of the field by five strokes and finishing the course under par, the only competitor to complete the feat.
“As the season progresses, I hope to always keep improving,” Xie said. “This weekend was the first official tournament we've had this spring so it definitely pointed out some holes in my game that I hadn't noticed before.”
Xie, seeded number three for the Crimson, started off relatively slow. Finishing the first round at the front of the Harvard group but four above par, the eventual champion would begin the second set of golf in twelfth place. Xie would only get progressively better. A second round score of one below par allowed her to jump 10 spots to second place and a finish of four below in the final round earned the sophomore the gold medal.
“It feels really good to have played well after our long offseason,” Xie said. “With the recent snow, our team hasn't been able to get as much outdoor practice as we would like. This tournament was especially special because our team hosted, and our amazing coaches Kevin [Rhoads] and Naree [Song] helped put the tournament together, on top of coaching us.”
Starting slow wasn’t just a problem for Xie, but the entire top half of the Crimson squad. After the first round of play, Harvard was tied for fifth place. The team’s top golf was Xie—in 12th place—followed by captain Anne Cheng in 15th, and sophomore Anna Zhou in 20th. The second round would be the group’s cumulative best of the weekend with the group of three jumping a total of 30 spots forward.
Cheng leapt so far forward in the second round, up to second place, despite the fact she fell four spots in the third she finished with a solid sixth place performance. The captain completed the invitational with a total of 224, eight over par.
Seeded number one for the Crimson was Zhou who finished the invitation at 16th. She was followed by teammates, senior Nina Fairbank at 28th and freshman Ji Hae Lee at 43rd.
For ancient Eight teams, only Princeton fielded golfers that outdid sixth place finishing Cheng. The Tigers’ number five seed, Amber Wang, left Fla. with a silver medal while teammate and number one seed, Hana Ku took fifth.
With the bronze team medal, Harvard was followed in team rankings by Rollins College and then Pennsylvania, Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown, in that order. Of the four, only Pennsylvania fielded golfers that placed in the top 10, with one taking seventh and two more tying for tenth.
Disadvantaged by the long northern winter and cold temperatures, the team hasn’t had the advantage of a lot outdoor practice. These meets in the south represent an opportunity to get back under the sun and prepare in an environment that will be similar to that which they will be playing under in the Ivy League Championships in a few weeks. With only one more meet between the Crimson and the that event, the team will head to Bloomfield, Conn., next weekend to participate in the another invitational, this time hosted by the Hartford Hawks. The tournament will take place at the Tumble Brook Country Club.
“The tournament this weekend was a great start to our season,” Cheng said. “I'm very happy with where we are as a team, especially since we haven't been outdoors recently. We are always in the continuous process of improving our techniques and our mental game and from here on out, we'll try our best to get in the reps we need to perform the way we want to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before Sunday, the last time that the Harvard women’s tennis team had won its Ivy League opener sophomore Erica Oosterhout was a freshman in high school. Oosterhout played a major role in ending the streak as the Crimson topped No. 44 Dartmouth in a hotly contested showdown at the Murr Center on Sunday.
Harvard (13-6, 1-0 Ivy League) had waited nearly a full year since its last spring Ivy League contest—a 5-2 loss to the Big Green (12-3, 0-1) to end last season—before the contest got pushed back an additional day due to Saturday’s snowstorm.
“We were really excited to finally start our first Ivy League match of the season,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We had a lot of anticipation that was building up. We had a lot of nerves in the beginning during the doubles that contributed to our slower start, but I’m really proud of the way that we bounced back in singles and really showed our dominance.”
In a back-and-forth match, it was only fitting that the result would come down to the showdown between each team’s top singles player. Oosterhout, who was dominant at times during her team’s nonconference slate, took on Dartmouth co-captain Taylor Ng, a senior who has had her fair share of success against the Crimson.
The Haddonfield, N.J. native entered Sunday’s match carrying a perfect singles record against Harvard, with her team having won all three matchups during her time with the Big Green. Despite Ng’s experience and success against the Crimson, Oosterhout proved to have the upper hand.
A tightly contested first set went to Ng, 7-5, but her opponent did not appear flustered. Oosterhout had won five of her last six singles matches before Sunday, with the two most recent contests going to a third set. After losing seven games in the first frame, the Tampa native would go on to drop just six the whole rest of the afternoon, roaring back for a 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 victory that gave Harvard its first win over Dartmouth since 2013.
While the Crimson picked up the clincher from Oosterhout, the team’s captain and most experienced player also picked up a key win at No. 2, with the point coming in much more dominating fashion. Captain June Lee, who had lost in all three of her previous singles matches against the Big Green, broke through on Sunday against fellow senior and Dartmouth co-captain Jacqueline Crawford.
“Playing Dartmouth is always a battle,” Green said. “They’re always well-prepared and we knew going in that it was going to be tough. I’m just proud of the way June and Erica stayed composed. It’s very important for your top players to really remain composed throughout the match. It really helps the players down below when everybody thinks that the match is under control.”
Lee and Crawford squared off as freshmen, with the latter capturing the victory at the No. 3 spot with a 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 win in Hanover after Lee cramped up while leading 4-1 in the third. It was Lee, however, who got the last laugh in what was likely the final matchup between the seniors.
“I remember that freshman match very, very well,” Lee said. “I’ll never forget that. I’m definitely way fitter than I was when I played her my freshman year. I’ve been working on being more aggressive, coming up to the net more, stepping in on short balls, and going in for riskier shots that I used to be scared to go for. I think that made the big difference.”
After the first set went to a tiebreak—which Lee took, 7-5—the only senior on Harvard’s roster cleaned up in the second frame, sending Crawford back to the New Hampshire backwoods with a 6-1 defeat.
“June came out on fire today,” Green said. “I was quite excited to see her step on the gas, something we’ve been talking about at practice, how we should really close the door on our opponents.”
The two singles wins for Oosterhout and Lee were redemption for the pair, which teamed up as the Crimson’s top doubles duo. After struggling in doubles play early in the year, Harvard appeared to have bucked the trend just in time for the start of Ivy League play.
The Crimson had won eight of its last nine doubles points dating back to February. However, on Sunday, it was not to be. Ng and junior Kristina Mathis topped Lee and Oosterhout, 6-2, the duo’s worst loss since Feb. 12.
“They definitely came out a lot stronger in doubles, so we need to work on getting a stronger start and being more aggressive from the beginning,” Lee said. “We knew that singles would be a tough fight and everyone fought to the end and knew that we were somehow going to be able to come out with four singles points.”
The doubles point went to the Big Green after the Crimson’s freshman duo of Natasha Gonzalez and Irene Lu was ousted by Julia Schroeder and Racquel Lyn. Gonzalez and Lyn both graduated from Houston high schools last spring, with Gonzalez captaining the best St. John’s School team since 2009 and Lyn winning four consecutive state singles titles without dropping a set while at St. Agnes Academy.
Mathis and Lyn had the distinction of being the only two players on either team to win both their singles and doubles matches. Playing at third singles, Mathis topped Harvard freshman Lexi Milunovich, 6-2, 6-3. It was the first match for Milunovich since Jan. 28 as the New Canaan, Conn. native has been battling injuries.
Despite the loss, Milunovich being in the lineup was a step in the right direction for the Crimson. The freshman was the top-ranked member of Harvard’s 2016 recruiting class and was listed as the No. 20 prospect in the country, according to the Tennis Recruiting Network.
“As the rest of the season progresses, she’s just going to start getting more and more comfortable playing her game,” Lee said. “I think that’ll be good and it’s nice to have her back and playing. Hopefully, that just helps everyone on the rest of the lineup.”
Lyn edged junior Annika Ringblom in one of only two three-set singles matches on the day. The first-year sandwiched a 6-2 loss between 6-3 and 6-4 victories at the fourth singles spot. The win by Lyn was one three singles points won by freshmen.
Like Lee and Oosterhout, Lu and Gonzalez were both able to bounce back from their doubles loss earlier in the day. After falling to Schroeder in doubles, Lu took care of business at No. 4 singles, picking up a straight set victory over the junior. Gonzalez followed suit at No. 6, topping fellow Texas freshman Chuyang Guan, 6-4, 6-4.
“Something that I think our team is kind of known for is our resiliency and I think that idea has been instilled into the back of their heads, knowing that even if we lose the doubles point, there are still six singles matches to be played,” Lee said. “If we lose the doubles point, it’s ok, turn the page, and get ready for singles.”
The win was a big one for the Crimson not only because it was the first time that it had won its Ivy opener since 2012 but also because Harvard beat a Dartmouth team that tied for second in the conference a year ago and was the highest-ranked Ancient Eight team entering the weekend, according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s rankings.
“I’m obviously very, very happy since I’ve never experienced this since I’ve been at Harvard,” Lee said. “I think it’s really going to build our confidence. It’s really tough losing the opener because you know you’re still in it, but it’s tough knowing that you’re already starting from behind so we’re feeling really good about getting this first win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Peering up the stairs of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, Devin Tringale feasted his eyes upon a foreign spectacle. Readily equipped with cameras and microphones, every major news station from the Greater Boston Area awaited Tringale’s arrival upon the top step, eager to interview the captain from the last college hockey team still standing in the Commonwealth.
“Had to Snapchat it,” quipped senior forward Luke Esposito. “It’s just been pretty incredible all around.”
This flood of attention did not crash upon the Bright by accident on Wednesday. A spring spotlight has been cast in the direction of Cambridge because for the first time in decades, the Harvard men’s hockey team has a game to play in the month of April—perhaps even two.
After hanging on by a thread—alternatively known as goaltender Merrick Madsen’s left pad—in the East Regional final last Saturday against Air Force, the Crimson ensured that its 2016-17 campaign would continue into Chicago. With 3-0 and 3-2 victories over Providence and Air Force at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center, No. 2 Harvard (28-5-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) captured a spot in its first Frozen Four since 1994—a year that predates the creation of the “Frozen Four” label itself.
Making its 13th appearance in the national semifinals, the Crimson will play in the first of two contests Thursday evening (6 p.m. EST) at the United Center, the home of Chicago’s Blackhawks and Bulls. Harvard possesses a measly 3-9 record in the semifinals dating back to 1955, but this time around, the Crimson will enter the potential penultimate game of its season hotter than ever. Harvard is currently riding an 18-game unbeaten streak and a 16-game winning streak—both program-bests.
The Crimson’s dominance over the course of these streaks has not gone unnoticed. In the 18 games since Harvard’s last loss back on Jan. 17, the Crimson ranks first in the nation in scoring offense with 4.22 goals per game and third in scoring defense with 1.67 goals allowed. Harvard has also trailed only once during that span—and for less than seven minutes—to teams not from New Haven, Conn.
“Everything just started blending in,” said senior Tyler Moy, commenting on the evolution of the team’s attitude during the streak. “It became a culture of just winning, and it felt good. It was just like we expected to be winning. You walk a fine line between confidence and cockiness, and I think we’ve done a great job of that, maintaining a humble outlook on everything and recognizing the fact that...you can’t take an off night.”
“I think we’ve become well aware of how good we are and the opportunity that we have,” Moy added. “And I think all of the guys in the locker room don’t want to pass up an opportunity like this. Because who knows when it’s going to come around next.”
While there’s no denying that Harvard will enter the Frozen Four as the hottest team in the country, the Crimson’s first opponent at the United Center is right on Harvard’s tail. Minnesota-Duluth, ranked second in the PairWise and third in the polls, heads into Chicago having gone 15-1-3 over its last 19 contests.
Now winners of seven straight—good for the second-longest streak in Division I Hockey—the top-seeded Bulldogs (27-6-7, 15-5-4 NCHC) get set for the Frozen Four having survived the tournament’s most difficult regional by the skin of their teeth, edging Ohio State and Boston University out in Fargo, N.D., by identical 3-2 overtime score lines.
“We have a great amount of respect for Minnesota-Duluth,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They’re a team that’s year-in, year-out tremendously successful. They have a great balance. They’ve gotten great goaltending, they have a good mix of size and skill, and they just go about their business winning hockey games.”
Donato also acknowledged that he considers UMD head coach Scott Sandelin to be “amongst the best in the country.” With one national championship in 2011 already under his belt, Sandelin—now in his 17th season behind the Bulldog bench—will be looking to add another in his third trip with UMD to the Frozen Four.
This year’s Bulldog team is led by senior forward Alex Iafallo, who is currently riding a 13-game point streak and also leads UMD in both goals (19) and assists (30). In addition to the senior who has already doubled his point total from a year ago, the Bulldogs have three more skaters—all underclassmen—in 30-point territory: sophomore Adam Johnson (18 G, 19 A), freshman Joey Anderson (11 G, 23 A), and second-year d-man Neal Pionk (7 G, 26 A).
Meanwhile after winning a three-way goalie competition in the preseason, freshman netminder Hunter Miska ranks second in the country with 26 wins, behind only Madsen, who’s been named the Most Outstanding Player in two consecutive postseason tournaments—the ECAC playoffs and the East Regional. Yet, Miska has actually gone slightly longer than the Crimson’s veteran netminder since taking a loss—the rookie hasn’t received an L on the stat sheet since Jan. 13.
Nonetheless, while Miska’s numbers are certainly solid, he ranks only 17th in both save percentage (.919) and GAA (2.21). The freshman’s consistent presence in the win column can largely be explained by the Bulldogs around him that have helped UMD finish among the top 10 in both scoring offense (3.40) and scoring defense (2.27).
With perhaps Harvard’s toughest opponent on deck, Donato remains glued to his season-long approach. Rather than worry about Duluth, the 13th-year coach said that the Crimson intends to “focus on what [Harvard] brings to the table.” Esposito added that it’ll be important for the Crimson “not to be swallowed up by the moment,” but he doesn’t expect that to be a problem given Harvard’s already faced similarly high stakes in the Beanpot final.
If the Crimson does in fact come away victorious Thursday night, Harvard would earn a chance to play for a national championship Saturday night against either Denver, the tournament’s top overall seed, or fourth-seeded Notre Dame, the champion of the Northeast Regional.
“We don’t want this to be our last game,” Tringale said. “We think we have two more games and that we can do it all. We don’t want to get complacent right now.”
“I think all the guys in the locker room recognize the fact that this is something larger than ourselves and larger than our team,” Moy said. “It spans the entire institution and in a sense, even the city of Boston.”
“Once we get there, we’ll take it one game at a time,” Esposito said. “But...if we could get two wins this weekend, it’ll change the rest of our lives.”
