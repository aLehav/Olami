After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 98 brands of bottled water are sold in the U.S., a  country that has some of the most reliable, sanitary, and clean tap water in the world. Do we really need to be purchasing these bottles? A growing movement on college campuses nationwide claims we do not, arguing against the bottled water industry and calling on universities across the country to ban the product’s sale on campuses.  By replacing bottled water with public reusable-water-bottle filling stations, colleges are making it easier for students to quit their habit. We believe that Harvard should join the movement.
Those promoting the ban are correct to label disposable bottles as detrimental to the environment. They produce large quantities of unnecessary waste, and reports suggest that over 68 percent of recyclable bottles are not recycled properly. Despite appearances, bottled water is often merely normal tap water that has been filtered through a process called reverse osmosis, which can require almost 10 gallons of water to purify one gallon. Such waste is simply unnecessary.
Additionally, packaging and transportation produce carbon emissions that could easily be avoided. Considering that the tap water available in our faucets is already filtered and of high quality, buying a bottle provides negligible benefits while contributing to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. By banning the sale of bottled water on campus, Harvard could do its part to decrease these harmful emissions.
That is not to suggest, however, that merely installing water-bottle filling stations is the perfect answer. Nalgenes and other reusable water bottles cost more than disposable bottles, and universities like Harvard should provide discounted reusable water bottles to make sure all students have access to them.
Beyond the ban, colleges should continue to seek opportunities to be environmentally responsible, and, of equal importance, engage and educate students about the steps they are taking so as to change student behavior. While ideally measures like the ban would yield life-long habits, even reducing students’ waste for their four years on campus would be beneficial. We commend Harvard for its open dialogue about environmental initiatives and hope that the University continues to inform its students about the ways on campus that they can already make responsible choices. Moving forward, adopting the ban would serve as further evidence that green truly is the new crimson.

Maybe it’s just me, but the idea of flying in a “saddle-like” airplane seat with only 23 inches of leg room seems a bit ridiculous. Unfortunately, some airlines disagree. Aviointeriors, an Italian design firm, recently introduced the SkyRider, the latest in airline trends and concepts designed to increase revenue for airlines at the expense and comfort of already-disgruntled passengers.
It is easy to see why the SkyRider, a seat that compresses passengers by angling them downward, appeals to airline companies. Airlines would be able to fit more of these seats on an airplane and create new class of seating that would be cheaper than coach fares. Although some in the industry are skeptical about the SkyRider’s market potential, many are confident that the low prices would appeal to certain customers who are presently priced out of flying. Ideally, the seats would only be used for short flights, though manufacturers claim that they would also work for flights up to four hours. According to Avioninteriors, several airlines, including a few in the U.S. have expressed interest in the new seat designs. Ryanair, the notoriously low-budget Irish airline that was the first to charge for in-flight meals and considered charging for restroom use, has also expressed an interest in SkyRider seats.
On one hand, “saddle” seats would provide passengers with cheaper alternatives to flying. Some passengers would willingly forsake the comfort of 31 to 35 inches of leg-room for reduced fares, and the rest would still have the option of first-class or coach seats.
On the other hand, there are still various safety concerns that need to be dealt with before such a seat can be approved. Seating passengers together in such a crammed way would be disastrous if an evacuation were necessary.
But perhaps just as saliently, this new class of seats would increase stress and tension in-flight, thus making the overall state of flying even more difficult. Current airplane seats aren’t the epitome of comfort unless one chooses to pay more for first-class or extra leg room. At only 31 to 35 inches of leg-room, these seats are nonetheless decent. After rushing through long and hectic lines at the airport, I would prefer to sit down somewhere relatively decent than cram myself into a tiny, claustrophobic-looking seat that’s somehow supposed to resemble a saddle-seat. Anyone who says otherwise is deceiving themselves; SkyRider passengers will very likely be extremely uncomfortable throughout their flight.
Airline travel has increasingly become more stressful with numerous fees for checked luggage (in some cases, even carry-on luggage), in-flight food, and entertainment and some airlines have even gotten rid of their complementary beverages. Airport lines to check-in and pass through security tend to be long and only aggravate the stressful experience. What airlines need to understand is that combined, these minor annoyances become more than just an issue of comfort. Flying is a hazardous procedure that requires teamwork on the part of the crew and passengers, and overly agitated passengers make a flight less safe.
I acknowledge that the industry is struggling, but that is not an excuse to disregard the safety and comfort of passengers—which are perhaps linked. Passengers are already paying excessive amounts for these extra fees; they should at least be able to pay decent prices for decent seats.
The airline industry is desperate. It is pushing its customers’ patience and will likely continue to do so with outrageous fees and ridiculous ideas. Even if the SkyRider is not adopted by most airlines, its mere creation only indicates that things in the airline industry can only get worse.

We are Godot. That is, if we Americans still believe President Barack H. Obama’s promising words, then we have been waiting for guests as hard to find as Samuel Beckett’s eponymous character—ourselves. Obama’s rhetorical flourish “We are the ones we’ve been waiting for” was embedded in a mostly healthy message about the power of Americans to achieve their goals. But it seems that only citizens with progressive inclinations are these heralded newcomers.
To take one prominent case, 56 percent of Americans favor the repeal of the health care reform bill, including one in four Democrats. President Obama’s “we,” by this count, is less than half the country. A closer look at public support for Democratic reforms shows that these policymakers have been “waiting” only for the small percentage that relishes government intervention even more than liberal social goals. It would be better, both in terms of grammar and accuracy, for the president to admit to his implicit redundancy and say, “We progressives are the ones for which we progressives have been waiting.”
Many Americans, in fact, are dissatisfied by the persistent recession and unemployment that progressives included in Obama’s “we” helped cause. President Bill J. Clinton’s National Homeownership Strategy is often highlighted as one of the causes of the housing bubble that preceded the current crisis. Clinton’s plan to “increase ownership opportunities among populations and communities with lower than average homeownership rates” meant that individuals held assets that exceeded their credit worthiness. When housing prices fell, individuals who had bet that their houses wouldn’t lose value had nowhere to turn, since “those previously underserved” citizens couldn’t absorb any economic shocks to their household. Those who couldn’t afford to own homes in the first place were foolishly given homes under a policy in which misguided sympathy trumped economic necessity.
Considering President Obama’s 20-percentage-point drop in approval rating over his term, America’s attitude toward Obama’s confidence in his imagined populace is markedly different. We’re still waiting, and so far, we aren’t pleased with the results. Obama’s push for reforms that Americans decisively opposed at time of passage, and continue to oppose, indicates that he prioritizes the progressive “we” over the real “we,” the American public.
Democrats have faith in the public—but only when the public shares their confidence in government intervention. What’s worse, the implicit Democratic message is that if we’re not these mysterious “ones we’ve been waiting for”, then we just don’t know what’s good for us. As the passage of health care legislation without our consent exemplifies, if we’re not members of the much smaller progressively-inclined “we” that Obama must have been talking about in his inspirational remarks, our opinions are not of consequence.
Why do the President and progressive Democrats trust the state more than the people? This is probably so because popular will can hinder the progressive. The people can say no to government expansion. The power of the state, however, can be widened or limited as much as a policymaker desires according to ideology. The vox populi is a reality check to the abstract world of theory.
President Obama has told us that “we are the change we seek.” But what happens when we as a nation change our minds and reject the change we once sought, or, increasingly in the case of this administration, that others seek without our consent? Well, when we are not the “we” that Obama had in mind, our preferences are abandoned in the name of political doctrines. Citizens can protest, but credos can’t.
When the governed protest modern Democratic governance, it’s the former who are shown the door. And even when we’re ahead of the curve, we’re still wrong. A majority of citizens rejected the difficult-to-reconcile notion that Obamacare would expand coverage and cut costs, even before both the International Monetary Fund and the Congressional Budget Office released reports backtracking on their earlier forecasts that spending would be reduced. For those who have less faith in the efficacy of political machinations, there’s help. Conservatism offers alternatives in which social betterment can occur while preventing the state’s at times undue and unwelcome intrusion. Most types of political conservatism, even outside the type offered by Glenn Beck, eschew ideology, particularly one that restricts the “we” of the vox populi to a select group.
Current popular resistance to progressive Democrats’ reforms imparts an important lesson. If we as a public are not “the change we seek,” progressives’ expectations, rather than national sentiment, should change. Progressives have tried celebrating their own arrival into politics and applauding their own reforms. Based on the latest predictions, few others are joining in the excitement and will likely show their lack of enthusiasm at the ballot box.
It’s time for the people to be heard, even if the rest of us outside President Obama’s progressive “we” won’t be as self-congratulatory when our turn comes. We, all of us and not just supporters of the current administration, might be waiting for something else, and an administration responsive to the continued urging of the public would be a good place to start. Even without certificates commemorating the public’s reclamation of the feeling that we matter, I think that this movement might gain momentum, perhaps even this November. So far it seems we’re all actors in the Theater of the Absurd, and it’s a tired role. Let’s hope the public gets a better representation on the political stage after a different casting call next month.

As we enter the final weeks of the 2010 election season, we find ourselves awash in political rhetoric. The word “progressive” is used as both a rallying point and a slur, and politicians must make the strategic decision of whether to sell themselves as pragmatic moderates or staunch ideologues. Such a strong emphasis on labels and group identity has not been present in American politics since the McCarthy era, and its resurgence is nearly as toxic now as it was then. But let me focus on the influence of one label in particular.
Although its impact as a political branding tool has recently waned in comparison to that of its opposite, “conservative,” the term “liberal” still carries considerable heft in modern American political discourse. Whether it’s being used by the Democratic flock to mourn the passing of the great “liberal lion” Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 or by a conservative commentator to paint an opponent as a bloated Washington bureaucrat squandering the fruits of America’s labor, the label “liberal” can make or break a political career.
Tell someone from the United Kingdom, though, that a political candidate is too liberal because of her support for increased taxes, and you’ll likely be greeted with bemusement (provided that your acquaintance is not already familiar with the American political lexicon). Chances are that most citizens of countries other than the United States will share your interlocutor’s confusion.
The reason for this (as many already know) is that the definition of “liberal” is drastically different in the U.S. than it is in the rest of the world. Most other countries continue to adhere to the classical roots of the word: the Latin “liberalis,” or “of freedom.” Liberalism therefore refers in most of the world to a political philosophy espousing political, social, and economic freedom, whereas, in the United States, it tends to exclude economic freedom. An “economic liberal” in the U.S. would favor a higher level of government management of the economy, while an “economic liberal” in Europe would tend to favor freer enterprise.
The reason that this distinction rises above the level of mere linguistic pedantry is that, in our current two-party establishment, almost all debate in the U.S. that has an effect on political outcomes takes place between Democrats and Republicans. Economic liberals (U.S. definition) are therefore lumped together with social liberals (universal definition), while economic conservatives are grouped with social conservatives, despite the fact that there is no inherent epistemological connection within the components of either of these two groupings.
As a result, the level of ideological cross-pollination between these four basic factions is disappointingly low. Few mainstream candidates identify as both socially liberal and fiscally conservative—i.e., as classic liberals. Even the Tea Party, ostensibly a libertarian movement, finds itself taking conservative positions on most social issues due to its tendency to draw supporters from the Republican Party.
Many people who do identify as socially liberal and fiscally conservative (this columnist included) hesitate to call themselves “libertarian” due to that term’s association with the radical populism of the Tea Party. While the label “liberal” would suffice in most countries to indicate a non-radical preference for both social and economic freedoms, its use in the United   States would convey an entirely different concept.
Political discourse in the United States is poorer for this coincidence of the English language, and many sensible reforms that would find no trouble gaining support in countries with large liberal parties fail to accumulate enough of a base from either party in the U.S. Sadly, the reality is that the term “liberal” means but one thing to the vast majority of Americans. And although it doesn’t seem as though that will change at any point in the foreseeable future, I sincerely hope that “liberal” is a term that will one day come to be understood in all its nuances.

Hauling lumber up three miles of trail in Vermont in the pouring rain did not intimidate the seven freshmen members and two upperclassmen leaders of FOP 62, but it did impress the Green Mountain Club of Vermont, which awarded its Group of the Year Volunteer Award to the service trip last month.
The Green Mountain Club, a non-profit which maintains Vermont’s Long Trail, the oldest long-distance trail in the country, organizes group service trips.
However, it does not award the Group of the Year award every year, according to Membership and Volunteer Coordinator Mari Zagarins.
“We wait for a group that really deserves the award rather than just giving it out to anybody,” she said.  “Harvard did a really great job this year.”
FOP 62, one of five service trips organized by Harvard’s First-Year Outdoor Program, was responsible for carrying 12 foot-long pieces of lumber up three miles of the Skylight Pond Trail to the Skyline Lodge in order to build a handicap accessible outhouse on the site.  The trip was labeled C, the highest level of difficulty among FOP service trips.
An unexpected amount of lumber and pouring rain on the second day of hiking slowed progress and the absence of a building permit obstructed building plans. But the team members motivated each other to keep going and ultimately the group decided to give up their day of free hiking and finish the task, according to Michael L. Zamora ’14, one of the team members.
“We wanted to get the job done,” he said.
Zamora was “completely surprised” when he heard about winning the award.  “None of us had expected something like this,” he said.
The group drove to Vermont on September 25 for the award ceremony, where they received a special plaque and complimentary year-long memberships to the Green Mountain Club, said Rebecca J. Howe ’11, co-leader of the team.  The costs for the trip were covered by FOP.
“It’s great that FOP was able to make that possible for us.  Our FOPpers were really proud that they were able to contribute to the trail,” she said.
“FOP is delighted to be honored with this award,” said FOP Director Paul “Coz” R. Teplitz ’03.
FOP, Harvard’s oldest pre-orientation program, has been working to strengthen its service program for many years now because it wants to give back to the trails it uses so extensively, according to Teplitz.
Incoming freshmen “are asking questions that are central to their identity,” Teplitz said, “and we think that service is a worthy value to have in one’s life.”

The Akanksha Foundation’s chief executive Vandana Goyal stressed the importance of creativity and student participation in the classroom—teaching methods her nonprofit uses in educating children living in the slums of India—yesterday afternoon at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Speaking to a crowd of two dozen graduate students, Goyal, who joined the nonprofit in 2006, shared her experience expanding the organization and negotiating with government officials in India.
“She has a unique perspective on public-private partnerships, and that seems to be a trend that comes up a lot, especially in the [Graduate School of Education’s International Education Policy] program,” said Serenity D. Clerk, a master’s student who coordinated the event and worked for the foundation for two years starting in 2007.
Founded in 1990, the Akanksha Foundation began as an after-school program to supplement the education of 15 children living in low-income neighborhoods. The organization now serves 3,500 children in 58 after-school centers and six of its own schools.
About 180 teachers—many of whom were placed through Teach for India, which Akanksha’s founder Shaheen Mistri established in 2008—work with students to help them attend and stay in school, Goyal said. Goyal estimated that 80 percent of students who went to Akanksha centers are now attending college.
While very few of the teachers have professional degrees in education, Goyal said she believes the foundation’s staff has been effective in directing the energy of the children to continue their learning.
Jonathan P. Newton, a master’s student in the audience who volunteered for Akanksha for two months in 2008, agreed.
“They were wild,” Newton said. “But they really wanted to learn.”
Newton said he hopes the Akanksha method is adopted in other countries.
“It would be awesome if people modeled their own ideas after Akanksha,” he said.
Going forward, Goyal highlighted the need for education professionals and leaders coming from education schools like Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.
“Finding people in the leadership level of education is really hard, so if any of you want to come, that’s my pitch.”

The Office of Career Services plans to remain open and offer off-campus trips during the Optional Winter Activities Week this January, adding to the list of College-sponsored activities available during that time.
During Optional Winter Activities Week—the last week of January Term—OCS will offer workshops on topics such as grant applications and summer internships, as well as drop-in hours.
“We’re planning a full week of programming,” said Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities—an umbrella organization that includes OCS.
OCS will also sponsor three different trips during Optional Winter Activities Week—two to New York City and one to Washington, D.C.—to give students an opportunity to learn more about potential employers.
Though the details of the trips are still being finalized, each trip will help students explore different careers within a specific industry, according to Anthony J. Arcieri, an assistant director at OCS. Students may visit government agencies in Washington, D.C. or fashion industry giants in New York, Arcieri said.
“Fashion is big on our campus,” Mount said.
Each trip will accept up to 25 students, who will pay a program fee of approximately $20, according to Mount.
Mount said OCS would like to sponsor similar trips abroad in the future.
After last year’s inaugural J-Term, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds solicited feedback from administrative offices across the College, which resulted in the College’s decision to let students stay on campus the last week of January Term.
“We were a big part of reporting back to the dean and other administrators,” Mount said of OCS.
“We just said students need a little more time on campus before classes started to prepare for deadlines that were coming up,” she added later.
Mount said Optional Winter Activities Week will allow students to take advantage of resources at OCS before spring semester.
“It’s really hard [for students] once classes start to put all that energy into it,” Mount said.
Lucy M. Caplan ’12, who has only visited OCS once during her time at Harvard, said she thought it was “a smart idea” for OCS to be open during Optional Winter Activities Week.
“I think I’d be more inclined to go during a time when I didn’t have more academic commitments,” Caplan said.

Past and present Peace Corps directors celebrated the 50th anniversary of a speech given by Former President John F. Kennedy ’40 announcing his intention to form the Peace Corps in a forum yesterday evening.
The discussion, sponsored by the JFK Jr. Forum at the Harvard Kennedy School, focused on the Peace Corps’ past accomplishments and future goals.
The directors discussed the Peace Corps’ achievement in connecting Americans with the rest of the world, while making an impact on the everyday lives of the countries it has served.
“In this globalized economic world, it’s important we understand people outside our borders and they should understand us,” said Former Peace Corps Director Elaine L. Chao.
Current Director Aaron S. Williams spoke of his visit last week to Ghana, the first country to host Peace Corps volunteers, noting that the impact of the Peace Corps is still visible.
“The Peace Corps allows Americans to engage in different cultures, learn another language, and to promote world peace and friendship,” he said.
The event, titled “Answering Kennedy’s Call to Service”, included a recording of Kennedy’s original speech and news footage of NBC’s coverage of the anniversary. The directors praised Kennedy’s ability to motivate Americans to serve, but also recognized that today’s Peace Corps needs to adapt to a changing world.
“I think it may be time for those of us who care about the Peace Corps to cast an unflinching eye at the Peace Corps today, to contemporize it for the next fifty years,” said Former Peace Corps Director Mark D. Gearan ’78.
His suggestions focused on incorporating advancing technology in volunteer work, and increasing funding and scale, allowing for more volunteers.
Former Peace Corps Director Gaddi H. Vasquez added that the organization should encourage participation from a broader group of ethnic backgro]unds. “One of the aims of the Peace Corps is that it look more like the panel sitting here tonight,” he said, referring to the diversity of the speakers.
Over the past 50 years, approximately 1,200 Harvard alumni have volunteered in the Peace Corps, with 19 currently serving, according to Williams.

When Susan Burton’s five-year-old son was hit and killed by a car in 1981, she turned to cocaine.
Over the next 20 years, she was convicted for drug offenses six times before she checked herself into a rehabilitation program and promised herself she would not relapse again.
Burton—now a criminal justice system activist who founded a South Los Angeles-based nonprofit, A New Way of Life Reentry Project—was awarded the 2010 Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award for her efforts to fight social injustice by the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School yesterday.
“I am a dreamer, but never in my dreams had I thought I would be here at Harvard one day,” Burton said. She will receive $125,000 as part of the award, which is given every other year to community leaders nominated by their peers.
Founded in 1998, A New Way of Life has helped hundreds of female ex-convicts by providing them with housing, moral support, and legal advocacy.
Burton said she believed there were few resources available to help women in her situation pull their life together in Los Angeles.
After learning that the incarceration rates in her community had been increasing in the 1990s, she said she decided “something had to be done.”
Casey Otis-Cote, associate director of the center’s Gleitsman Program in Leadership for Social Change, said Burton was selected for her impact on her community and personal journey.
“There was something about Susan’s story that just fascinated the judges,” she said.
Gretchen L. Heidemann, A New Way of Life board member who nominated Burton, said Burton takes the time every day to speak with women who live in the organization’s housing.
“It reminds them that if Susan could do it, they can too,” she said, adding that she has worked with Burton for the past six years.
Past Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award winners include Teach For America founder Wendy Kopp.
Burton was also recognized earlier this year for her work as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2010.

A federal district court judge has issued an injunction against the enforcement of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, raising the possibility that University President Drew G. Faust might move to recognize the Reserve Officer Training Corps on campus.
Faust has said that the elimination of the policy, which prohibits gays from serving openly in the military, is a condition for University recognition of the program.
In yesterday’s ruling, U.S. District Judge Virginia A. Phillips ordered the military to stop enforcing the policy and to halt all investigations under the measure.
It is probable that the Justice Department will appeal the ruling, making it unlikely that the University will immediately move to recognize ROTC.
In recent weeks, the University’s policy on ROTC has drawn the ire of Mass. Sen. Scott P. Brown, who publicly blasted the University for not recognizing ROTC while lobbying for passage of the DREAM Act—a measure that would offer a path to citizenship for undocumented youths who attend college or serve in the military.
The University, through a spokesperson, declined to comment on the ruling yesterday.
The suit was brought by a Republican gay rights group, the Log Cabin Republicans, who joined with the larger gay community yesterday in cheering the ruling.
“The order represents a complete and total victory for Log Cabin Republicans and reaffirms the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians in the military who are fighting and dying for our country,” said Dan Woods, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, in a statement issued yesterday.
Proponents of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” decried yesterday’s ruling, which they say could threaten military morale.
“Judge Phillips is playing politics with our national defense. Once again, an activist federal judge is using the military to advance a liberal social agenda, disregarding the views of all four military service chiefs and the constitutional role of Congress,” said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, who opposes the law, in a statement.

A welcome addition for undergraduates already tired of eating in the dining halls, six new restaurants are scheduled to open in Harvard Square by the end of December—offering students options ranging from Belgian waffles to vegetarian fast food.
Addressing rumors surrounding the vacant space at 1380 Mass. Ave.—formerly Alpha Omega Jewelers–Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that both a Starbucks and a Pinkberry will open side by side in that location in the spring. However, according to Cambridge Commissioner of Inspectional Services Ranjit Singanayagam, Starbucks has yet to receive approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals; the company is scheduled to have a hearing before the BZA on Dec. 2. As for Pinkberry, “There’s talk of a frozen yogurt store opening up next door,” Singanayagam said.
Other establishments scheduled to debut in the near future include Bull BBQ—a Korean barbeque restaurant—which will occupy the space formerly home to Shilla Sushi at 57 JFK Street by the end of October or early November, according to Jillson.
Initially stymied by the scarcity of beer and wine licenses for sale, Bull BBQ has now obtained the proper permit and awaits approval by the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, Jillson said.
“We anticipate that the license will be approved and they will be opening hopefully by Head of the Charles weekend,” she added.
For students seeking healthier fare, Clover Food Lab—a permanent incarnation of the popular MIT food truck—will offer “local, just-cut” and, whenever possible, organic fast food in a restaurant setting, according to its website.  With their space at 7 Holyoke St. currently under construction, Clover has obtained a beer and wine license and is scheduled to open the first week of November, Jillson said.
Although the former site of Herrell’s Ice Cream has stood vacant since last fall, 13-15 Dunster St. will soon host the First Printer Restaurant, Bar and Grill.
While the restaurant’s sign formerly stated that First Printer would open in the spring of this year, Jillson stressed that the owners plan to begin serving by late fall, taking their time to attend to all the details.
“They want it to be very special because it’s a historic location,” she said.
Catering to anyone with a sweet tooth, Zinneken’s, set to open by the end of the year, will occupy the space at 95 Winthrop St. and offer made-to-order Belgian waffles with a variety of toppings, Jillson reported.
Rounding out the list are Enzo’s Pizzeria—taking over the former Finagle A Bagel space—and Al’s Harvard Square Cafe, a sandwich shop to open in the Holyoke Center across from Oggi, which are both scheduled to open in December, according to Jillson. Both establishments have obtained their building permits and are now under renovation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Queer Students and Allies who gathered yesterday in front of the science center for the “Speak Out” rally for LGBT youth did not do so alone. Leaders and representatives of many campus groups joined them to stand up in solidarity against acts of discrimination and fight for a more accepting future.
“Opening up channels of communication between groups shows that the onus is on the entire community to be supportive and vocal about welcoming students and enabling them to be open and honest,” said QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11. “Especially for people of color or from different faiths, they carry so many complexities that it becomes even more crucial to acknowledge that the LGBT members of whatever community we’re speaking about deserve to be recognized.”
Members of many communities on campus have committed to recognizing such intersections of identity by signing a petition affirming their support for an Allied Harvard.
Cultural, political, religious, and social groups on campus—including the Society of Arab Students, the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship, and the Harvard University African Students Association, among 21 others thus far—have signed the petition stating their support.
The petition states three linked goals: to recognize the harm of homophobia and transphobia and the violence perpetrated through discrimination; to challenge the assumptions leading to bias; and to speak up and out as visible allies of the LGBT community at Harvard and beyond.
Members of several of these groups—including the Harvard Republican Club, Harvard Democrats, Fuerza Latina, Black Men’s Forum, the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, and the Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance—stood up to speak at yesterday’s rally.
“This is not a political issue—this is a human issue,” said President of the Republican Club Mark A. Isaacson ’11. “We must end this hatred before one more youth kills himself because the people around him were too closed-minded to open their arms to him.”
James F.L. Croft, chair of the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s LGBT student group QueerEd, emphasized the importance of reaching out to people who face discrimination.
“We’ve all felt, even if just for a moment, that there is no one standing with us, no one on our side,” Croft said, issuing a call to action to everyone assembled.
“It isn’t enough to allow these things to happen and then to mourn them after—we need to catch these kids before they jump,” Croft added.
After the speeches ended, the QSA led participants and attendants from the Science Center into the yard to perform the symbolic act of “queering the John Harvard statue.” Students wrapped the bronze founder in rainbow flags as others gathered around his feet, uniting their voices with the cheer, “What do we want? Equal rights! When do we want ‘em? Now!”
QSA Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12 said she was thrilled with the turnout and with the pledges of solidarity from so many student groups.
“We are a community standing in solidarity,” she said. “People are getting involved and speaking out to make this an inclusive space and a queer-friendly space for all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School has eliminated its pathology department and moved two growing departments to other real estate on campus amid pressure to accommodate the space needs of expanding departments, according to a recent letter sent to faculty by Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier.
The Medical School had expected to move several of its departments into the Allston campus, but given the indefinite freeze on construction, Flier has had to find other options.
Researchers in the pathology department have been reassigned to other divisions within the schools and will continue their research under the auspices of their new departments.
Under the new arrangement, the department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics will be renamed the Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology and will include many of the pathology department researchers.
The new department will be housed in the $260 million New Research Building, which opened in 2003.
The change will expand what had been a fairly small department into a larger one, bringing researchers from different disciplines together under the same roof, which administrators hope will lead to innovative research and collaboration.
But the academic shuffle has raised fears that the bureaucratic reorganization could disrupt what had been a highly productive unit at the Medical School.
“What I will say is that Microbiology and Molecular Genetics is a tight-knit, close, and I think very productive department, and my hope is that the changes don’t disrupt that dynamic,” said Lee Gehrke, a professor in the department and Quincy House Master.
His colleague, Jonathan R. Beckwith ’57, said while his own research might benefit from the move, he thinks interdisciplinary innovation is not predicated on collapsing departments.
“I’m just not particularly certain that it’s going to be particularly productive between people in different disciplines any more than they interact now,” Beckwith said. “It’s going to make it a significantly bigger department, and we liked our relatively small intimate department—people are a bit disappointed with that.”
The departments of Neurobiology and Systems Biology, both of which need additional space to expand, will take over the space that the Microbiology and Molecular Genetics department will vacate.
That should relieve some of the pressure on the Neurobiology department, which had wanted to expand but was unable to in the face of fiscal and space constraints in recent years, according to department chair Michael E. Greenberg.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a continuation of an academic forum held two years ago to consider the origins of and possible solutions to the economic crisis, Harvard President Drew G. Faust moderated a discussion about prospects for the future of the global economy in Sanders Theater yesterday afternoon.
The five Harvard professors on the panel positively reviewed the Obama administration’s response to the crisis and praised both the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, but offered more cautious and gloomy predictions about the months and years ahead.
“For the average American, the recovery is going to take an extremely long period of time,” said Economics Professor Richard B. Freeman, a labor economist.
“I would say [that the recovery will last] until the end of this decade. We are headed for a very, very difficult period,” Freeman said.
Panelist Brigitte Madrian, a professor of public policy at Harvard Kennedy School, said that the nation’s Social Security and Medicare programs are predicted to run out of money by no later than 2040, according to a 2006 report from the Social Security Administration.
“Nobody wants to bite the bullet and try to solve these problems early” because of the political ramifications, said Madrian, who is also the director of the Social Science Program at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. “But if we wait, the problem just becomes worse and worse.”
The panelists also defended the work of economists in the years before and after the crisis, noting that the specialized nature of economic study limited academics’ ability to spot the problems beforehand.
“The economics profession did not do a good enough job of understanding what was happening quickly enough,” said Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell. “Academia is slow moving...we need to speed up.”
Campbell used the analogy, which was frequently revisited, of a bus driving down a winding mountain road. Other cars, or foreign economies, need to allow the American economy to turn around the curved road, or else the economy might crash again, panelists said.
Closing the event, Faust echoed that analogy, saying that the various components of the American economy are on an “uncharted road, we don’t have a very good map, and the skills [we’ve learned before] may not apply.”

The steps of Memorial Church shone with over 200 candles at last night’s Queer and Allied Candlelight Vigil, where members of the Harvard community gathered to reflect on anti-LGBT sentiment and inspire the people huddled on the steps to action.
The vigil was planned to coincide with the 12th anniversary of the murder of Matthew Shepard, a young gay man who was tortured to death in Laramie, Wyoming.
“Despite everything Matthew faced, he found a way to be exactly who he was,” said Susan B. Marine, Assistant Dean of Student Life and Director of the Harvard College Women’s Center.
Marine emphasized the importance of being able to “love ourselves” in the face of homophobia, but added that “it’s not enough to love ourselves—we have to love each other too.”
Other speakers included Ian K. Lekus, a lecturer in the History and Literature Department, Lowell House Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck, five BGLTS tutors and proctors, and several others.
“All the people gathered here are evidence of the fact that you are loved deeply by people you hardly know,” said Eliot House Tutor Michael C. McGaghie ’01, asking resident tutors, deans, and faculty to raise their hands. Sixty or more hands went into the air. “We value you, and don’t forget that,” he said.
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson added that while Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds was unable to attend last night’s vigil, she had expressed her deep care for the LGBT community.
“Our commitment to justice and nonviolence is a way to create better understanding,” Nelson said.
That sentiment was further conveyed by Matthew P. Cavedon ’11, vice president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Catholic Student Association.
“We disagree on many things,” he said, “but every one of you is my brother and my sister and I hope to give you the kind of love I wish those no longer with us could have known.”
Messages of hope were mixed with recollections of recent and past violence. Sara Kimmel, a psychologist at Harvard University Health Services, recalled a violent homophobic attack early in her Harvard career, and noted the recent incidents of bias on Harvard campus.
“Homophobia and heterosexism exist outside, but they’re here at Harvard too,” Kimmel said, adding that the entire Harvard community is responsible for creating a safe environment on campus.
“We urge anyone in this community who is at risk or contemplating suicide to reach out.
We are here for each other and stand together in total solidarity,” Austin said, leading the assembly in lifting their candles skyward.
As the candles burned down to their wicks, QSA Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12 called on faculty to increase resources for the LGBT community.
“We don’t want this to end with the end of this vigil,” she said. “This is a small space but the world is big, and we need to take our vigilance, our words, and our action beyond these steps and out into that world.”

Some coaches leave Harvard to work somewhere else. Others retire, while a few decide to spend more time with their family or pursue other interests.
And then there’s Shana Welch.
Welch left her post as the Crimson’s assistant men’s water polo coach to play professionally for the N.E. Patras Club in Greece in A1 Ethniki, the country’s most prestigious water polo league.
“All of us would jump at the opportunity to become a professional water polo player,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said.
Welch began playing on a big stage at Michigan, where she became a three-time All-American and broke the Michigan marks for goals in a game, a season, and a career.
After graduating in 2007, Welch played professionally in Australia before landing a job at Bucknell as a swimming coach.
The following year Welch relocated to Cambridge, taking up her former post as the assistant water polo coach.
“Shana was great for us,” junior Mike Katzer said. “She brought a ton of experience playing at very high levels.”
Welch’s impact was broader than just her instruction to players. After coach Erik Farrar left following the 2009-10 season, she helped first-year coach Minnis adjust to the existing program.
“[Shana] understood the Harvard culture; she understood the way the athletic department did things,” Minnis said. “I wanted to make sure that tradition and some of the stuff stayed the same…she was really helpful in that.”
The possibility of playing in Europe presented itself this past summer, when several European clubs began contacting Welch.
Finally, in the middle of this fall’s water polo season, N.E. Patras came calling—this time with a contract. Welch accepted, though the decision was anything but easy.
“I was excited but sad at the same time that I would have to leave,” Welch said. “I’m gone for 10 months, and with that comes leaving my family and leaving Harvard and leaving my dog and leaving everything else.”
During the entire process, no one was more supportive than Minnis.
“He seemed more excited than I was,” Welch joked.
A veteran of the sport, Minnis understood how precious Welch’s opportunity was.
“There’s not a lot of [playing] opportunities out there, and her window is closing…it was something she couldn’t pass up,” Minnis said.
The players added their support too.
“She gets to play professional water polo in Greece, and we all thought that was incredible,” Katzer said. “She made the right decision.”
Minnis and Welch informed the team of Welch’s impending departure shortly before the last game of the Princeton Invitational Sept. 12.
“We weren’t gonna let her at that point go out on an L,” Katzer said. “It definitely motivated us.”
Despite not having won a game yet at the tournament, an inspired and emotional water polo squad squeaked out a 9-8 victory over a strong George Washington team.
A few weeks later, Welch boarded a plane going halfway across the world, adding another chapter to her ever-developing water polo saga. Then it was back to the pool, back to the two-a-day practices, and back to the conditioning.
Welch’s work for the past few years has only heightened her understanding of the game.
“It’s fun for me to take my coaching experiences and bring that back into the water with me, which is something I didn’t have the last time I was playing,” Welch said.
Welch has made a 10-month commitment to N.E. Patras, but it’s anyone guess as to what she does after her contract expires. She might continue to play in Greece, though she said that all depends on how the season goes and the contract options available.
“I haven’t thought that far ahead yet,” Welch admitted. “[I’m] just taking it one day at a time.”
Currently, Welch is preparing for the team’s first game on Nov. 20 at home. The squad’s only foreign player, the former Wolverine will once more resume her post as driver.
“We have a couple national players from Greece and a few other strong players, so hopefully we’ll have a good team,” Welch said. “It’ll be fun and interesting to see how it all comes together Nov. 20.”
Another coach and team a continent away will be eagerly awaiting that day too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some players worry about a sophomore slump. But for Taylor Docter, a second year on the volleyball court has just made her that much more important to her team’s offense.
The Harvard sophomore outside hitter made quite an impression from the moment she arrived in Cambridge in 2009, earning a starting role last fall during her first collegiate semester.
“Coming in [Docter] just added a lot to our team, in terms of energy and skills as an outside hitter,” co-captain Miyoko Pettit said. “As a starter as a freshman, she was able to get experience in some big games last year.”
And if Docter was intimidated by these daunting matchups, she certainly didn’t show it on the court.
She racked up 214 kills in her rookie season—good for third on the team—and 20 service aces, as the Crimson improved from 5-9 to 8-6 in the Ivy League, including a final-weekend victory over then-undefeated Penn.
“[Taylor] handled the starting role so well last year,” said junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll. “I love having her on the court with me. It’s easy to gel with her, and she brings excitement and energy to the court, which is an invaluable asset to the team.”
With Ingersoll, Docter, and top offensive threat senior Mikaelle Comrie returning, Harvard appeared primed for an even better season this fall.
But early on, it appeared that the Crimson had instead taken a big step backwards, as it dropped 10 of its first 12 contests, including seven in a row.
Starting this weekend, Docter decided that enough was enough. After Harvard opened its contest against Columbia on Friday by dropping the first two sets, the Crimson sophomore went to work at net, sending kills all over the court.
Docter finished with a team-leading 17, to go along with a game-high five service aces, and Harvard roared back for its first conference win of the season.
“[Docter] trained a lot this summer trying to improve her game, and you could tell…especially this weekend,” Pettit said. “She came out with a bang and was very, very consistent.”
“Taylor has definitely become our go-to hitter,” Ingersoll added. “I have complete faith that when the setter sets the ball out to her, she’s going to get the job done. That’s the feeling you want to get with your teammate.”
And with sophomore Beth Kinsella dishing flawlessly to Docter, all of a sudden the Crimson looked like a different team.
The squad dropped its opening set on Saturday against Cornell as well, but with Docter once again taking control—leading all players with 13 kills—Harvard walked away with its second-straight conference victory and hopes of another winning Ivy season.
“This weekend was a turning point, because the preseason was difficult and we were struggling through some things,” junior libero Christine Wu said. “After falling behind and actually pushing through and finishing [a win], that really proved to our team how good we are and what great things are in store.”
But the weekend’s offensive explosion, while encouraging for the Crimson, was far from a revelation for Docter.
The sophomore has quietly put together another stellar season, even in the midst of her team’s early struggles.
With 122 kills on the year, Docter has evolved from being among her team’s best attackers to being the primary target on offense.
While the second-year player’s attack percentage is down—from .161 last year to .154 thus far in 2010—her team-leading kill total has come on a whopping 468 attempts, over 100 more than the next Crimson hitter. Clearly, the team feels that Docter has come into her own on the court.
“[Docter] has always had a lot of talent, but one big thing is that she’s grown up a lot in a sense and is a lot more mature,” Wu said. “She’s stepping up and taking on the role of a leader on the court.”
“She’s matured a lot as a player and as a person,” Pettit agreed. “She’s always been a confident player, but her experience from last year has really translated…I think her court awareness has improved a lot in terms of finding open holes. She’s a very smart player.”
Clearly, the sophomore hitter has done enough to impress her teammates. If Docter keeps up her strong play, she’ll continue to dazzle opponents as well.

It’s that time of year again. Halloween is coming. Whether you plan on trick-or-treating or attending Currier’s Heaven and Hell, you probably need to start looking for a costume soon. If you’re tired of being a nurse, and you don’t want to join the mob of Lady Gagas, then we have a few suggestions for you. 
 
Cigar Guy 
Many of you have probably seen the now-famous picture of Tiger Woods hitting a golf ball directly into the lens of a nearby cameraman. However, the best part about this picture might not be the golf ball. Standing in the crowd on the right-hand side of the photo is a man known on the Internet as “Cigar Guy.” Halloween costume, anyone? 
 
Mitochondria 
Okay, it sounds weird, but what Harvard student hasn’t dreamt of dressing as a “membrane-enclosed organelle found in most eukaryotic cells?” But seriously, Jack Black did it, and the profits from the costumes go to help kids with mitochondrial disorders. Plus, maybe you’ll get the attention of your cute TF.
 
Adam Wheeler 
Okay, so maybe nobody from outside of Harvard will get it, but dressing up as Adam Wheeler is an option. Wear a white t-shirt, hand out fake resumes, and make sure that your eyes are as wide as you can possibly make them. 
 
Tiger Woods 
If you don’t like Cigar Guy, dress up as Tiger Woods. Just wear a polo shirt, khakis, and a cap, and walk around with five or six blonde women. If you can’t find real women, barbies make good substitutes. 
 
The House from Disney Pixar’s UP
Who didn’t love this movie? Though you could always dress up as Buzz or Woody from this year’s Toy Story 3, this costume, made to look like The House from UP is a much more creative option. Just put together a cardboard house and tie on some helium-filled balloons, and you’ll be ready to go. 
 
If none of these costumes does it for you, you can always go with Snooki, Justin Bieber, a character from Mad Men, or the classic “nudist on strike” (just dress normally).
