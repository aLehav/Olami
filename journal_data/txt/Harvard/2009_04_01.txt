The economic downturn may have taken its toll on Harvard’s endowment, faculty, and janitorial staff, but it certainly hasn’t hurt admissions. This year the College accepted a record-low seven percent of applicants out of from 29,112 aspiring candidates. We congratulate the Class of 2013. Praise is also due to the admissions office for choosing such an extremely diverse group. The accepted class includes a record 10.9 percent Latinos, 10.8 percent African Americans, and 17.6 percent Asian Americans and comes from a record 82 different countries.  Almost a quarter of the class is eligible for free or reduced tuition under Harvard’s scholarship program for families making less than $180,000 a year.  We have high expectations for next year’s freshmen and are looking forward to seeing many excited new faces on campus.
At a time when greater numbers of students in the incoming class and throughout the school need financial aid, we are encouraged that, despite budget shortfalls and the difficult economy, the College will be growing its financial-aid program. The admissions office recently reported that the Class of 2013 will receive an unprecedented $147 million in financial aid next year.  Financial aid needs to continue to be a priority. The caliber and integrity of our educational experience depends on keeping Harvard a financial possibility for all qualified students, regardless of their background.
We hope that, across the board, colleges that are strapped for cash think before reducing financial-aid programs and that schools with need-blind admissions policies remain that way. Universities lose more than just individual students when they admit wealthy applicants above equally or more qualified, but less affluent, students. Higher education should not be a business—when schools start evaluating their core priorities in this regard, their intellectual integrity suffers. There is a fine line between keeping a school alive to educate another day and doing long-term damage to its commitment to meritocracy.
If they must reduce their financial-aid programs, universities should be proactive in guiding students toward alternative funding sources, such as private scholarships or government aid. Under the new administration’s budget, students will also be able to take out bigger federally sponsored Perkins loans. The number of colleges whose students are eligible for this loan will increase from 1,800 to 4,000.  Admittedly, these proposed benefits will not be available until July 2010, but they will still help.
Lastly, we hope that colleges remain transparent with their admissions process. If they must make financial status a bigger factor in their admissions decisions, then they should be clear about this with students. If they need more information about applicants, they should request it instead of trying to ascertain financial need using deceptive tactics such as evaluating zip codes or parent’s background.  These methods are underhanded and do not provide an accurate picture of a family’s financial situation or a student’s ability to afford school. As hard as it is to tell students that their backgrounds might hurt their applications, it is worse to let them think that their shortcomings are academic alone.

This year, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the world’s largest and most powerful military alliance, will celebrate its 60th birthday. Since 1949, NATO has provided for the collective defense of the United States, Canada, and their European partners. Today, NATO’s 26 member nations collectively contribute millions of troops, trillions of dollars of material and services, and entire libraries of intelligence information to a central command in Brussels, Belgium, while NATO military units are involved in regional security and peacekeeping developments in the Western Balkans, the Gulf of Aden, and Afghanistan.
While these developments—as well as the expansion of the alliance into the central European region in 1999 and 2004—are encouraging, the transatlantic partnership must return to its roots. If NATO is to remain relevant to European security, the organization must refocus its energies toward defending its newest and most vulnerable members against a Russian resurgence. At the same time, harebrained schemes for further expansion must be reconsidered. Toward that end, NATO must adopt a more comprehensive agenda—one that tackles larger issues like energy and information security, economic stability, and the details of military and security cooperation—in order to remain an effective guarantor of European peace and stability.
The regional divide in NATO must be overcome to make this reform a reality. Specifically, this means recognition across the continent that a resurgent Russia represents a very real and even existential threat to some members of the alliance. The recent history of Eastern and Central Europe helps to explain why the newer members of NATO—especially Poland and the Baltic states—are extremely concerned with a Russian military resurgence. The invasion of Georgia last year should serve as a chilling reminder of just how far Moscow is willing to go to preserve its national interest in the former Soviet sphere. 
While the Bush administration’s scheme to place missile interceptors in Poland and the Czech Republic was admittedly inflammatory, Polish and Czech agreement to the plan reflects a very real concern for the conventional military guarantees included in the pact. Even if the Obama administration does not go ahead with the plan to install defensive systems in these Central European nations, it should still make it clear that any sort of aggression against our allies in this region would be absolutely unacceptable. To that end, the Obama administration should implement a conventional defense treaty with Poland and the Czech Republic, maintain our already extant bilateral relationship with Bulgaria, and sign a comprehensive defense agreement with all three Baltic republics, including the continuation of the vital Baltic Air Policing program until at least 2018.
Meanwhile, America’s strongest allies in Western Europe—particularly Germany—have been reluctant to criticize the post-Soviet oligarchy (or “managed democracy”) that supplies them with vital natural gas. This divide has persisted even in spite of a recent announcement by President Dmitri Medvedev that Russia would embark on a massive new spending and modernization scheme for its outdated military. Therefore, a new energy security policy—one that effectively minimizes the risk of overt dependency on Russia while investing in alternative and renewable technologies—should be at the top of the agenda at the alliance’s annual meeting in Strasbourg, France, and Kehl, Germany, this weekend. 
Aside from the Bush missile plan, one of the most heavily debated and controversial issues in European security affairs is the continued expansion of NATO into geopolitically unstable regions of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus. Specifically, the issue of Ukrainian or Georgian membership has been of significant import to the future of the alliance. While Ukrainian aspirations to the alliance are particularly strong (and emotionally affective, given the tragic history of that country), NATO leaders should proceed cautiously and not be afraid to deny admission to these two countries. 
Unlike the Baltic republics, which enjoyed a relatively brief but politically significant interlude of political independence between the two World Wars, the idea of a Ukrainian or Georgian nation-state is one that did not become a reality until 1991. Since then, both nations have been paralyzed by economic crisis and political turmoil. Until the situation in these countries is stabilized—which, given the international financial crisis, may not occur for a few more years—NATO should be reluctant to grant them Membership Action Plans. The Partnership for Peace program—which encompasses a far larger group of countries with a distinct interest in maintaining political stability on the continent—should instead be used as a dialogue to mediate between these states and their former imperial master.
During his presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama made it clear that he wanted to support the new and emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. While there are many factors that may affect the emergence of stable democracies and market economies in the region, one thing that will positively affect the trajectories of all the countries on the continent is a continued American military presence on the European continent and a strong transatlantic dialogue. Toward that end, the Obama administration should spearhead the effort to build a better NATO.

This May, Barack Obama will deliver his first commencement address as president. He will not journey to West Point, as Bill Clinton did for his first such oration, to prove his patriotic gratitude for the men in uniform. Nor will he return, a devoted and loyal son, to one of his almae matres, either in the Ivy League or Occidental College. He will not even patronize with his presence an institution run by the states that his federal budget will bloat with generous stimulus disbursements.	
No, the president has chosen America’s iconic Catholic university, Notre Dame, for his inaugural commencement rostrum. Such a move, indeed, may seem fitting for the president’s political calculus. Both Indiana and Catholics swung from George W. Bush’s column in 2004 to support him last November, and this speech will no doubt continue the president’s much-ballyhooed outreach to “faith-based” voters. From the perspective of the White House, the setting in South Bend is impeccable.
Yet Notre Dame has come under fire—and for good reason. 
Catholics especially, including many prominent bishops, have questioned the judgment of the university administration to invite the president, whose policy positions and many recent enactments directly oppose the Church’s essential teachings. The president had signed executive orders releasing a ban on funding abortions abroad and reversing the Bush administration’s refusal to subsidize embryonic stem-cell research. These two questions of abortion and stem-cell research—on which the Church and the White House are in direct opposition—are the political issues that the American episcopacy had singled out, both before the election and after, as the most crucial for Catholic voters to consider. The Church teaches, as American bishops recently have affirmed and reaffirmed, that life begins at conception and that abortion and the harvesting of embryos is morally intolerable—positions that for Catholics of good faith are not susceptible to compromise.
For the country’s most prominent Catholic university to invite the president, especially in the wake of those recent pronouncements, proves how little esteemed the American bishops and Church teaching are in the ivied confines of South Bend. The incoming Archbishop of New York has criticized the invitation, the local prelate conspicuously has refused to attend the ceremony, and most Catholic intellectuals—at least those not in open doctrinal rebellion—have written unfavorably of the fiasco. Unsurprisingly, conservatives still miffed about November’s results, which include perhaps a majority of the practicing and churchgoing faithful, have been especially harsh on Notre Dame. 
The university administration has acted quickly in its own defense. The president, Fr. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C., has described Obama’s “visit as a basis for further positive engagement,” and not as “support [for] all of his positions.” And Douglas W. Kmiec, Obama’s most ostentatious Catholic booster during the election, panegyrized the President as a real “fightin’ Irish,” like Notre Dame, “when it comes to working for social justice.” American Catholic laymen on the right and left will continue to disagree, no doubt, on which political issues—abortion or immigration reform, stem-cell research or education—are most salient.
Yet this ought not to be a political issue, as many of the combatants in the media polemics have made it out to be. For Catholics, regardless of voting patterns, the stakes should be clear: Inviting Obama calls into question Notre Dame’s fidelity and submission to the teachings of the Church, as required of all the faithful, and especially Catholic schools. 
But from a secular perspective, as well, Notre Dame has failed ignominiously. The proper role of the university, in transmitting and elaborating on the collected wisdom of the ages, is to pursue and safeguard truth. Secular universities, enraptured by modish postmodernism and value-free social science, understandably have abandoned that creed. But for an institution sustained by the Catholic faith, which still, however unfashionably, purports to serve and honor the truth, such a mission ought not be discarded thoughtlessly. 
The Catholic Church teaches that abortion and stem-cell research is wrong and forbids its faithful from supporting such practices, whether directly in person or indirectly through the ballot box. In inviting a president whose recent agenda prominently has contradicted those tenets, Notre Dame intimates that the Catholic truth it purportedly upholds is malleable and appropriately sacrificed for the fleeting prestige that a presidential commencement address would confer. 
Notre Dame provided the site several years ago for New York Governor Mario Cuomo to offer his infamous rationalization that, as a Catholic, he was personally opposed to abortion, but, as a public figure, he should not necessarily refuse to support it. Such a defense, mounted by every progressive Catholic politician since, clearly indicates that “truth” imposes no obligation if public opinion and the machinations of well-funded lobbyists are not fortuitously aligned. That shameful episode, a source of scandal to faithful Catholics even today, threatens to repeat itself in May.

The importance of sacred traditions and thought within the modern world was the topic of discussion during a well-attended open forum and question and answer session with noted professors Charles Taylor, Michael J. Sandel, and Homi Bhabha last night.More than 120 people crowded into the Barker Center’s Thompson room to attend the event organized by the Harvard University Press’ Executive Editor for the Humanities Lindsay E. Waters and professors Bhabha and Steven Biel, who are also the directors of the Humanities center at Harvard.An Emeritus professor of political philosophy at McGill University in Canada and a visiting professor of government at Harvard, Taylor spoke about theories of spirituality propounded in his most recent publication, A Secular Age. The book, printed in 2007 by Harvard University Press, centered around his ideas relating to the place of spiritual traditions in the modern world.Sandel, a professor of government at Harvard  University, developed these ideas with abstract examples. He said that he thought that the book had raised awareness of the need to incorporate spiritual concepts into public discourse. “The discussion was meant to debate the meanings of the sacred traditions in a secularized modern world,” Sandel said. “We’re both trying to make room in public and civic discourse for these discussions.”Natalie A. Smolenski, a sales representative at HUP and an organizer of the event, said that an underlying purpose of the forum was to discuss the role of the humanities at the university level. “The Humanities center at Harvard is a pioneering force,” she said. “It raises the most important discussion being had in the culture today.”Waters, an editor at the HUP, said that the panel made certain concepts in the humanities more accessible. “The barriers between the humanities break down when you listen to these two guys speak,” he said.At the end of the discussion, Taylor said, “I felt that the event was important in showing the complexity of civilization and the sacred and secular worlds. In it, one is not replacing the other, but there is an interweaving of the two, met with violent opposition in the process.”

Despite lacking the latest equipment, Pforzheimer Dining Hall will soon join Annenberg and several other House dining halls in daily composting.Pforzheimer, one of five Houses that does not have a compacting machine, is starting a pilot program in the next few days that will test the efficacy of manual composting. Composting, in which dining hall food waste is reused as fertilizer, is one prong of the University’s efforts to be more environmentally friendly, according to the Harvard University Dining Services Web site.Crista Martin, HUDS director of marketing and communications, said that the Quad Houses are behind in their composting efforts because of outdated technology.“When the Quad was originally renovated, composting was in its infancy,” she said. “They were not able to incorporate composting in their dish rooms then, and they still have not been able because of structural reasons and space.”Eliot, Leverett and the Quad houses do not have Somat food waste pulpers, which grind excess food down automatically.  In order to start composting manually, Pforzheimer dining hall workers will set food waste aside in yellow composting barrels without having the waste grinded.Food waste to be composted—either made into pulp by machine or manually collected—is bagged and put into marked barrels, from which it is picked up by local waste management companies.Martin explained that Pforzheimer was chosen for the manual composting pilot program because it had a loading dock and showed interest in the project. “It’s a place where all the elements come together,” she said.Robert V. Fitzsimmons ’10, the Pforzheimer House Food Literacy Project representative, hosted a special brain break to spread composting awareness on March 20.“We’ve noticed in the past that people aren’t aware of what HUDS is doing as far as sustainability goes,” he said. “Pfoho has been behind, but we’re going to catch up.”Martin said that HUDS currently composts 26,500 pounds of food waste in an average week.Pforzheimer dining hall staff are awaiting the delivery of the composting barrels to start the pilot program.The success of Pforzheimer’s project will determine whether or not manual composting will be implemented in the other four houses that lack a pulping machine.Martin said she was unsure of when composting would be implemented in those Houses.“We want to do our homework right,” she said. “We’re constantly looking at equipment that is available.”—Staff writer Carola A.

Alo, a high-end women’s clothing boutique, is closing its doors permanently after nearly nine years in Harvard Square.Owner Marie Santa Maria, who along with her husband Hernando also owns and operates the boutique Via Vai across the street, said that rising rent and a mismatch between the store’s offerings and Harvard Square clientele precipitated the closure.“We’re going to be reinventing ourselves somewhere else,” she said. While Santa Maria declined to disclose the exact location of the new store she and her husband plan to open, she said it would also be in the Square.Alo opened in 2000 after Seven Stars Bookstore vacated the 58 JFK St. location above Shay’s Pub & Wine Bar. The space is owned by the trust of Geneviève McMillan, a former Cambridge resident and philanthropist who passed away last year.Like other Harvard Square owners who have been recently forced to close their stores due to their inability to pay rent, Santa Maria attributed Alo’s lackluster sales to the recession.“I mean, we’ve got an economy problem here,” she said. “All these shops everywhere are dropping like flies.”The Santa Marias’ first foray in Harvard Square was a leather goods store, which opened at Via Vai’s current location in 1985. According to Marie, the economic recession of the early ’90s prompted them to turn from leather to clothing.“We’ve gone through good periods and good times and we have loyal customers here at Via Vai,” she said. “Honestly, Alo’s merchandise might have been a little too sophisticated for the area, which is mostly college students.”The store had provided clothing for the Harvard fashion show Eleganza and several fashion shows sponsored by Harvard Business School. Alo will liquidate its merchandise at the Santa Marias’ new store location.Despite the difficult environment for high-end retail stores, Marie Santa Maria was sanguine on the outlook of their next business venture.“It’s just a process that we’ve been through,” she said. “We’ve seen it all.”—Staff writer Shan Wang can be reached at wang38@fas.harvard.edu.

A dramatic rise in applications for jobs at the Central Intelligence Agency—which traditionally recruits heavily from the College—has seen no such spike from Harvard undergraduates.The Agency has for many years been actively using Harvard, as well as other colleges and universities nationwide, as a recruitment base. The CIA received over 120,000 applications in 2008, but for 2009 this figure has soared by approximately 50 percent, said CIA spokesperson Marie E. Harf. According to Robin Mount, the interim director of Office of Career Services at Harvard, the response from Harvard students has not changed dramatically, although interest remains high. Harf said that although this nationwide increase may be because of the economic crisis, “it is difficult to quantify how much it affects our hiring.”The Office of Career Services Web site states that out of 61 percent of students entering the employment sector after graduating in 2008, 2 percent took jobs in government and 1 percent joined the military. In 2008, the CIA hosted five recruitment events at Harvard, including career fairs, conferences and job fairs. Only six events were held for the entire Boston area in the same year. In total, 1,000 CIA recruiting events were held across the country last year.Deb Carroll, assistant director of the Office of Career Services for employer relations, said that “the number of students who attend these events has been significant.” She added that the CIA was getting more attention at the Career Forum this fall than it did two to three years ago.“We are always received very warmly by Harvard,” said Harf.The CIA looks for people who are highly qualified, motivated to serve their country, and who have skills such as foreign language abilities and technical expertise, according to Harf. “The CIA comes to Harvard because we have one of the best language teachings in the whole country,” Mount said.Yet, more extensive efforts have been made by other colleges and universities to aid CIA recruitment. Some universities, such as Berkeley and USC, have been a part of the CIA’s collegiate marketing program for the past 5 years, a program that allows the Agency to use marketing classes to engage directly with students. Harvard remains unaffiliated with this program. “In other colleges and universities there are lots of employers who engage with the faculty and the curriculum but this does not happen very frequently at Harvard,” said Mount.

Much like the rest of its industry, Harvard University Press is feeling the strain of the national economic downturn.Mary Kate Maco, publicity director of HUP, said that although the Press does not have specific numbers yet, she expects that sales declined similarly to the national average of 10 percent calculated by the American Association of University Presses.The AAUP’s recently-published survey reported that its member presses’ sales in both units and dollars are down roughly 10 percent for July through December of 2008 from the same period in 2007.Maco said that HUP was not caught off-guard by the recession, and has not had to rethink their plans, as they were anticipating a shift in the publishing market.“With the rise in popularity of digital content, the publishing industry’s sales had been seeing drops even before the recession,” she said. “It’s disappointing, but we’re trying to focus on the positive and remember that at least it’s certainly not the death of the industry. The current economy just makes it all the more imperative to follow the new trends.”Brenna E. McLaughlin, electronic and strategic initiatives director for the AAUP, said that nearly all university presses are experiencing a decline in sales.“It’s provided both an impetus and another obstacle to experimenting with new ways of disseminating scholarship,” she said.Both Maco and McLaughlin emphasized the importance of expanding university presses’ digital presence.Maco said she was excited to see the Press’ first online legal journal as well as the availability of HUP books on Amazon’s  wireless reading device, Kindle. She also said that because many of HUP’s books are targeted at a specific subset of academia, the Press probably has not been missing out on reaching much of its audience due to a lack of digital availability.Harvard School of Education Professor Daniel M. Koretz, who recently published a book with HUP about standardized testing, said that he has experienced decreased sales of his book, but attributed the falloff to lower demand for books in general.“What has happened to book sales in the past few months is independent of Harvard University Press,” he said. “Nobody is sure what kind of business models will work for selling digital books yet.”

The public and political pressure that led to former General Motors Chief Executive G. Richard Wagoner’s resignation may have unfairly overshadowed his part in reinventing the company after its decades-long decline, said several of Wagoner’s Harvard Business School classmates.Wagoner, who graduated from the Business School in 1977, stepped down on Monday at the request of the Obama administration, which has sought to force more rapid changes within the three beleaguered American automobile manufacturers that have received assistance from the administration’s multi-billion dollar bailout fund.GM lost $30.9 billion last year, and its share price has fallen to as low as $1.27 from a high of $35 three years ago. The company has been criticized for failing to anticipate plummeting demand for gas-guzzling SUVs and neglecting to explore energy-efficient technology, causing it to cede U.S. market share to foreign competitors such as Toyota.In particular, analysts have recently attacked Wagoner for the restructuring plans he enacted during his eight-year term as CEO, which included dozens of plant closures and thousands of worker layoffs, describing them as too little, too late.Several of Wagoner’s classmates, however, called his forced departure a unjustified political sacrifice to appease growing public dissatisfaction with big business.They pointed to GM’s success in expanding global market share and negotiating contracts with the powerful United Auto Workers union as evidence of the progress the former CEO had achieved. The blame, they said, falls largely on the crippling worldwide economic decline that has hobbled GM’s plans to reinvent itself.“He was well on his way to being a folk hero,” said Desmond C. Wong, who was in the same section as Wagoner during his Business School years. “Unfortunately, the current political climate in Washington is such that whoever’s a public face gets fried to a crisp.”Wagoner was known for being “polite to a fault” and “self-effacing” both during and after his time at Harvard, according to sectionmate David G. Offensend.But in his attempts to reform GM, his proclivity for “understatement” may have hindered efforts to convince a doubtful public that the company was aggressively moving forward with quality improvements, Wong said.Despite his public pillorying, many of Wagoner’s classmates expressed their affection for the student whom “everybody wanted to be around.”“I have heard from a lot of our sectionmates in the last 48 hours,” Offensend said. “Everybody is somewhat angry and somewhat sad. There’s a lot of support and affection for Rick.”—Staff writer Athena Y. Jiang can be reached at ajiang@fas.harvard.edu.

Frequenters of admissions gossip sites like College Confidential just got one more source for admissions news—from The New York Times.The Times venture, called “The Choice: Demystifying College Admissions and Aid,” was launched Monday at the height of admissions frenzy.The project was headed by NYT education writer Jacques Steinberg, who is also the author of “The Gatekeepers: Inside the Admissions Process of a Premier College.” According to Steinberg, the blog is intended to be a resource for high school students and their parents as they navigate the college admissions process.“This is a very stressful, sort of bewildering moment in the life of a kid and the life of a family,” said Steinberg. “And if you could try to put yourself in an applicant’s shoes, it might give them comfort.”He added that the blog could provide a level of reassurance that raw data could not, especially with colleges around the country accepting fewer applicants than ever. This year, Harvard College turned away 93 of every 100 applicants.“Harvard is one of the few schools around the country that turns away more than it accepts, so now you have perspective,” explained Steinberg. The blog features six high school seniors who are currently receiving admissions decisions. The students discuss their reactions to acceptance, wait list, and rejection letters. The blog also aims to educate applicants and their families about the financial aid process. Several students on the blog discuss how the aid packages will have substantial influence on their ultimate choice of where to matriculate.“My impression of the mission of the blog is that it is trying to reassure people,” said Nicholas A. Geiser, one of the six student contributors. “Even though the economy is kind of sour and financial aid offers are down, it’s still possible to afford a college education.”Geiser, a San Francisco University High School senior who applied to 12 schools including Harvard, also said that the blog is a way of reclaiming the college admissions process.“The impression I’ve gotten from my friends is that they seem very resigned to the process. It’s not particularly enjoyable, but something that you have to get over with,” he said. “I try to reflect on the kind of person I want to be and the kind of values I have and how that plays out in terms of education. There’s potential for a lot of personal growth and reflection.”According to Steinberg, the Times staff has tried to refrain from substantially editing the student posts, as the blog is meant to communicate the students’ personal experiences with as much genuineness as possible.“We are trying very much to stay out of their way,” said Steinberg. “I think they’re writing beautifully and very honestly.”

Today Show co-anchor Matt Lauer will address the Class of 2009 on Class Day, the Senior Class Committee announced yesterday.Lauer joins a heterogeneous group of past speakers including Ben S. Bernanke ’75 last year, Bill Clinton in 2007, and Seth MacFarlane, the creator of the popular cartoon “Family Guy,” in 2006.The Class Day speaker typically delivers a more light-hearted address to the College’s graduating senior class than the Commencement Day speech, which is given to all University graduates the next day.Senior class First Marshal Lumumba B. Seegars ’09 said Lauer’s experiences as a journalist have provided him with an “inspiring” perspective to share with Harvard seniors.“I think the good thing about Matt Lauer is that we are in a very interesting time in the world right now, and Matt Lauer is right in the middle of all those things,” Seegars said.A graduate of Ohio University, Lauer joined NBC in 1994 and has anchored the Today Show—the network’s morning news and talk show—since 1997.Seegars said that Lauer’s experiences interviewing scores of different people and traveling the world for the Today Show’s segment “Where in the World is Matt Lauer?” will allow the television personality to speak to seniors about the world outside the Harvard bubble.Yet the choice of a television news personality for the June 3 student-focused celebration left some seniors less than thrilled.“I’m sure he will be more entertaining than Ben Bernanke, but I was hoping for someone who hadn’t interviewed Britney Spears,” Maxwell S. Mishkin ’09, said of Lauer’s selection.Though Mishkin said he thinks he will enjoy hearing Lauer speak, he said he had been hoping for a comedian to be selected.In past years, the subcommittee of the Senior Class Committee responsible for selecting a Class Day speaker had alternated between comedic personalities such as Conan O’Brien ’85 and Sacha Baron Cohen, and more serious figures like former Meet the Press host Tim Russert.“It’s a more lighthearted day, but that doesn’t mean just comedians,” Seegars said.After hearing of Lauer’s selection, one senior created a Google Document online where seniors could write the names of people who they would prefer as the Class Day speaker to Lauer.The names on the list ranged from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tiger Woods to “Ryan” from “The Office,” who is played by B.J. Novak ’01.But Seegars said that Lauer’s speech will be relevant to seniors as they prepare to depart college for the real world.“I think it will be a great bridge as we are deciding how we will approach the world,” Seegars said.—Staff writer Lauren D.

The Cambridge Public School Committee interviewed the city’s three final superintendent candidates during a public meeting at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School last night. 
The finalists—Mary C. Nash, Carolyn L. Turk, and Jeffrey M. Young—were each asked to address the same seven topics in separate, hour-long interviews. 
Although parents, school faculty, and community members were present at the meeting, only school committee members were allowed to pose questions. Unlike at Monday night’s town hall forum—during which the finalists introduced themselves directly to city residents—yesterday’s discussion covered subject areas that were selected by the school committee, rather than the public.
The meeting was the penultimate step in a superintendent search that began in December, a month after former Superintendent Thomas D. Fowler-Finn’s early departure. Although committee members will base their decision on a set of criteria derived from community input, the rest of the selection process will not be open to the public. 
In last night’s interviews, all of the candidates said they had collaborative leadership styles, emphasizing their intention to immerse themselves directly in school communities.
“This is not a central office position,” said Nash, who is currently the academic superintendent for Boston Public Schools. “This is not a job where you sit in your office and make telephone calls.”
The candidates also touched on the importance of improving special education, which they said could meet a wide spectrum of needs. 
“What’s good for special ed children is what’s good for all children,” said Turk, who is the deputy superintendent of Cambridge Public Schools.
In response to a question about how they would work to diminish the city’s achievement gap, both Turk and Young—who is the superintendent of Newton Public School—said they believed holding all students to rigorous standards, regardless of racial and socioeconomic differences, would result in progress in all subgroups.
“I really believe that it’s about high expectations, strong curriculum, and excellence in structure,” Young said.
The school committee also asked each candidate to state their opinions on the city’s K-8 school system.
Turk and Young said that they would determine an action plan based on the recommendations put forth in the 2007 Blue Ribbon Commission report on the state of the city’s middle school education.
“It’s very important that a report like that not get shelved or framed on a wall somewhere,” Young said.
Young, who also noted that he thought that teacher membership in the commission had been low, added that he would remedy this by reconvening the group this summer and inviting more teachers to participate.
Mayor E. Denise Simmons told the audience that committee is tentatively scheduled to make a final selection within the week.

With Earth Day just around the corner, The Charles Hotel is planting some green of its own by decreasing parking rates for compact cars in its garage.Starting April 22, The Charles Hotel will debut the nanoMAX small car detection system, which will gauge the size of vehicles and automatically encode the information onto the dispensed parking tickets.To reward drivers who choose environmentally-friendly vehicles, compact cars will receive a discounted rate. Normal and oversized cars will not see an increase in parking fees.“We’re constantly looking for ways to make contributions to the community and the environment,” said Alex Attia, the hotel’s general manager. Attia also said there were financial considerations to the decision. Because of how green-conscious Cambridge residents tend to be, Attia said he expected a positive response to the initiative and increased business for the garage, which he said would compensate for the loss of revenue from the parking discount.Currently, the garage charges $34 for overnight parking and offers a ten percent discount for hybrids. The discounted rate for compact cars has not yet been determined. “I’m all for it,” said Jeff Meraj, a first year Harvard Kennedy School student who said he frequently parks his Honda Civic at the garage. Though he said the rate reduction would probably not induce people to switch vehicles, he said that the initiative “definitely increases awareness of environmental issues.”Though Benjamin J. Muchler, a Boston resident who owns a Volvo SUV, will not benefit from the discount, he said he supported the hotel’s decision.In addition to parking discounts, The Charles is honoring Earth Day by opening a “juice bar” in the garage, where customers can charge their hybrid and electric cars for free. The hotel will also offer a complimentary bicycle program, allowing its guests to explore Boston without guzzling gas.The Charles is not the only Boston hotel with an environmental conscience. The Seaport Hotel near Logan International Airport is offering complimentary parking for hybrid cars during the entire month of April.“We’re strongly motivated by environmental concerns,” said Matthew V. Moore, the hotel’s director of rooms and environmental programs. “The complimentary parking is our way of giving back to those guests who share a similar environmental philosophy.”Across the river, The Hilton Boston Back Bay Hotel has implemented numerous energy conservation measures in place, such as room occupancy sensors that automatically modify thermostat settings and new energy-efficient heating and cooling equipment and laundry machines, according to General Manager Christian Coffin. Though it has a parking garage, the hotel has not considered altering parking rates to commemorate Earth Day, he said.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

Beloved (read: loveably crazy) strength coach Craig Fitzgerald moved on from the Crimson in January to join the old ball coach at University of South Carolina as head of strength and conditioning for the football program. The popular coach's departure disappointed many of Harvard's athletes, but the opportunity to work with a bigtime SEC football program was lost on no one. For those curious about what Fitz is up to now, it seems that the energetic trainer is already becoming infamous at his new school.  Details after the jump:
According to Post and Currier blogger Travis Haney, coach Fitz remains terrifying as ever, with all of his focus formerly devoted to 41 Harvard teams now channeled solely towards Gamecocks football. The title of the post ("Craig Fitzgerald Scares Me") says it all. Can we get a "Why am I not surprised?" from an athlete in the room?
