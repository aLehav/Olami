After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Los Angeles’s food trucks have transformed the industry’s once-generic menu of hot dogs and peanuts to trendy, gourmet treats like cupcakes on a stick. How else would we have gotten the Korean-Mexican fusion known as Korean barbeque tacos without the flexibility available within the food cart business?  Yet, while the variety of choices available in these once-modest carts is commendable,  their wide consumer base could be dangerously affected by partaking if the carts are not properly monitored. As a result, we support the L.A. County supervisors’ tentative decision in favor of a stricter food regulation policy that will grade thousands of food trucks based on a similar safety standard as restaurants.
Although we encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of L.A. food trucks, we also believe they should be held to the same requirements as other establishments when it comes to safety, since they are in the business of selling food to others. Making sure food trucks are sanitary is especially important now, because the industry is quickly growing and serving mass quantities of people. Additionally, Los Angeles should extend food quality requirements—such as regulations monitoring trans fats—to these trucks. Stricter standards are necessary to ensure the protection of the general public
Some dissenters focus on the cost of these inspections. They worry that any extra fees or inconveniences to food truck operators could squash incentives for future businesses and innovation. To this, Dr. Jonathan Fielding of L.A.’s Department of Public Health said that industries should not worry because there are currently no extra fees. If this changes, he will notify the Board of Supervisors and propose a new payment plan. In terms of inconvenience, the operators should already be following basic food-safety procedures, and so this extra rating system should not be unduly difficult for them to follow.
Yet, there are certain aspects of the current ordinance that should be changed before it goes into effect. For example, the requirement that they report their routes is unnecessary. This would restrict the basic business model of food trucks, many of which try to enhance their allure by not having set routes, sometimes even tweeting their next location. In addition, the county must make sure to narrowly define what constitutes a food truck—perhaps based on revenue—to avoid including the innocent lemonade stand of your local neighbor within the category.
Regardless of these specific issues, the ordinance as a whole is a necessary step for the safety of L.A. residents and visitors. Consumers should face a choice between trying the banana cupcake lollipop or the strawberry, not between risking a foodborne illness or playing it safe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oct. 13, 2010 was a joyous day for the 33 miners who were finally rescued from a collapsed mine shaft in northern Chile and reunited with their families. What could have ended as a tragic disaster has instead become a symbol of human resiliency and resourcefulness and has catapulted the tiny Latin American country into the international spotlight.
By harnessing the expertise and technology from both Chilean and non-Chilean sources and allowing international media outlets to set up camp at the collapsed mine to provide round-the-clock coverage of the events there, the Chilean government, headed by President Sebastián Piñera, has successfully projected to the world an image of a modern, dynamic nation. Chileans have every right to be proud of the rescue operation’s impeccable execution, but once the euphoria subsides, they must be prepared for the tough questions that may soon follow.
To be sure, the sheer amount of planning and consideration that went into the rescue effort was extraordinary. While engineers went to work figuring out how to get the miners out, National Aeronautics and Space Administration personnel and Chilean submarine experts were called in to assess the psychological impact of the miners’ isolation. Once a food pipeline was installed, nutritionists worked with a special food-preparation company to ensure that the miners got healthy and appetizing meals every day. And in the final days of the rescue preparations, as the Phoenix capsule was readied for descent, special trainers worked with the miners remotely to ensure that they would be slim enough to fit into it.
Perhaps even more impressive than the nuts and bolts of the rescue was the way in which the world was able to follow every step of the process, access videos and photos of the miners in their captivity, and watch the miners finally emerge from the earth—in real time. Through social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook, people shared their joy and excitement for individuals half a world away.
The Chile mine rescue has been a called a made-for-TV drama, both in the sense that it was a story with naturally universal human-interest appeal and as a more critical commentary on Piñera’s handling of the crisis. The media-savvy politician has been accused of using the mine rescue to his political advantage and to prop up Chile’s national image, and his own—and if this was his aim, he succeeded.
Still, it is important to understand the glamorous rescue both as a national triumph and as a political attempt to smooth over possible criticism of Chile’s mining industry and its management.
After all, this—unlike the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Chile last February—was a manmade disaster. Several bloggers have already pointed out, quite rightly, that the amazing rescue should not obscure serious issues such as lax enforcement of mine-safety regulations, labor rights, and the wisdom of Chile’s heavy dependence on mineral extraction.
They should not be unduly concerned. Piñera may have focused attention on his country in order to make the both of them look good, but it’s not a light that can be automatically switched on and off. Although the miners emerged healthier and in better spirits than expected, spending two months buried deep underground is still an ordeal. As it becomes clearer whether or not the accident itself could have been prevented, the warm glow of international opinion could turn harsh. How Chile deals with that type of scrutiny may be a painful and complicated challenge even greater than that posed by the mine rescue itself.

In the wake of the deaths of over 12 queer students in the last few weeks—one as young as 13 years old—I was struck by how these tragedies could possibly be called deaths. A teenage suicide is not a death—it is a catastrophe. Too many teenagers committing suicide because of their sexual-orientation extends beyond the world of catastrophe into a dystopic nightmare that entraps us all, queer, straight, and asexual alike.
It is a nightmare that we are actively enabling by continuing to let students feel unsafe. We justify this because we offer no alternatives. Our daily vernacular is so predominantly heteronormative that we make “queer” mean, well, queer. Our resources are so limited that we do not reach those who see every moment as a struggle. Our public spaces are so unsafe that we are hyper-aware of the gender non-conforming individual in our bathroom. In “Female Masculinity” J. Halberstam writes about a “bathroom problem” where gender non-conforming individuals are policed in the bathrooms because their gender is not immediately decipherable. That is, gender non-conforming people are punished “as a result of having violated a cardinal rule of gender: one must be readable at a glance.” We have taken this “bathroom problem” that Halberstam writes about and dragged it into each facet of life where gender and sexuality policing happens in every public arena, measuring people up by their gender/sexual identifications.
And we are surprised that youth and teens cannot bear the immense weight of waking up each day and living through the horror of peers’ ostracization, the unbearable loneliness of being even a little bit different, the devastation of being called a “faggot” or a “dyke” or an “it.” There is something fundamentally wrong with a society that ignores the pain of queer youth and is subsequently troubled by devastating yet causal outcomes.
Dan Savage’s “Things Will Get Better” Campaign only makes me sadder. While I appreciate the value in queer people and straight allies affirming the value of life—that yes, for them, things did get better—things just won’t get better unless we take action. We cannot remain stagnant, our fingers in our ears and our eyes clenched shut thinking that tomorrow, someone else will fix constructs of homophobia, transphobia, and hate. This message implies that it is simply time that alleviates bullying and torment. Yet the root of this—hate—is not something that simply ceases after high school graduation. Nine arrests have been made in connection with the anti-queer sodomizing and torture of two gay teens and a  30-year-old man in New York. Hate is not simply locker room banter—and anyone who tells you that it gets better is far too optimistic.
While we can and ought mourn Raymond Chase, Tyler Clementi, Seth Walsh, Asher Brown, Justin Aaberg, Billy Lucas, Felix Sacco, Harrison Chase Brown, Caleb Nolt, Zach Harrington—we must ask ourselves how we can protect and celebrate those living: How we can create secure spaces for students of all ages, races, gender expressions, sexual identities, and religions? Addressing this epidemic of imposing normativity on those too fabulous to conform ought to be at the forefront of our concerns.
Maybe the tragedy of recent events is that they can happen anywhere, at any time. Harvard is not so uniquely cast off in our ivory tower that we are immune to similar disaster. Recently, hate crimes on campus have drawn attention to the problem of a lack of queer advocacy. The slow and inadequate response of Harvard as an institution suggests that this type of behavior is to be tolerated. For many on campus, this reaffirms a collective fear and alienation, a suggestion that Harvard is not as welcoming as we thought. On Tuesday night a vigil in front of Memorial Church brought out many queer students, professors, tutors, proctors, and allies. People shared messages of pain, hope, struggle, and optimism. While seeing this response from students and tutors was wonderful—I could not help but wonder why President Faust, Dean Hammonds, or Dean Dingman, were not speaking out to show their support.
In the wake of horrible tragedies, there remain stable pockets of hope. There are resources on campus that do so much good—Contact Peer Counseling, The Bureau of Study Council, and Mental Health Services. But resources are of no use unless they are actively partnered with the community to assure the safety of all members, promising to advocate and protect.
Students should be actively encouraged to seek out these resources—but we must also mobilize to bring these resources to them, fortifying their efficacy and our resolve as a community. Not only do we need to remove stigma associated with seeking help—but we must also raise awareness that no one should have to struggle silently or alone. Because ultimately, a Facebook group made post-catastrophe is a terrible elegy for something so intrinsically beautiful as a life.

I believe in freedom of speech and the power of documentary film. If any film festival delayed or suppressed one of its entries due to political reasons, I would condemn such an action. So when a film festival gives in to pressure to “spare the feelings” of the president of Iran, I feel obliged to point out a couple reasons why such thoughtfulness is absurdly misplaced.
The Beirut International Film Festival canceled, or at least delayed, the screening of a docudrama—“Green Days”—that provides a close-up look at the protests and government brutality that accompanied Iran’s 2009 presidential election. In other words, the same election that proved a dubious confirmation of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s power. Hana Makhmalbaf’s “Green Days” already aired at well-known film festivals in Toronto, Copenhagen, and Venice, where the film won “The Bravery Prize.” The reason the film has won this prize and others stems from its willingness to stand up to the Iranian government, even including amateur film of the public demonstrations during the elections.
Then President Ahmadinejad decided to visit Lebanon, and such a screening became inconvenient. According to the festival’s director, censorship authorities pressured the festival to postpone its screening. Such a move represents the sort of kindness and personal touch one seldom sees these days. How thoughtful of the Lebanese government: Ahmadinejad decides to take two precious days out of his busy schedule of oppression in Iran for a visit; the least Lebanon could do would be to censor anything that might trouble such a devoted, hardworking leader.
After all, Ahmadinejad always demonstrates such respect during his visits. Consider his last trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly in September. While visiting that city, he accused the United States of masterminding the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York. Perhaps this was the fault of my hometown for not doing a better job of paving the way for his visit—maybe “Green Days” or another film was airing, and this upset Ahmadinejad to the degree that he felt justified in so insulting his host city.
Lebanon learned that lesson and realized it had to smooth the way for Ahmadinejad’s visit. Makhmalbaf’s film would trouble the Iranian president and perhaps even remind him of his government’s brutality as it beat and murdered protestors during the election and its aftermath. Lebanon’s move to make Ahmadinejad more at home was noted by the filmmaker in an open letter she wrote on her family’s website (her father is also a famous Iranian filmmaker), addressed to the “Cinema Lovers of Lebanon”: “Ahmadinejad in my land is the symbol of censorship. Look how he brings censorship to your country before even arriving there.”
Establishing Iranian-style censorship must have ingratiated the Lebanese government to Iran, right? Depends on which government you mean. In Lebanon, there is the government, and then there is Hezbollah. The militant group—considered by many states a terrorist group—received Ahmadinejad with much fanfare, and the Iranian president met with its Secretary General, Hassan Nasrallah, at the end of his visit. Hezbollah is part of a unity government that seems to have tenuous control of Lebanon, and based on Ahmadinejad’s visit, you would assume Hezbollah was the only recognized group.
On a geopolitical level, Ahmadinejad’s meet-and-greets with Hezbollah officials are not surprising. It is well known that Iran functions as the group’s major backer, and Ahmadinejad has obvious ambitions to exercise increasing control over regional, and specifically Lebanese, politics. Iran would love to see Lebanon become even more closely bound and entrenched as a pro-Iran, anti-Israel regional player. It’s no coincidence that Iran has similar ambitions in Iraq—where Iran has reportedly schemed a pro-Iran coalition government that will be much less friendly to the United States.
What is disturbing, however, is that the coalition government—not just Hezbollah—decided it couldn’t show an already scheduled screening of “Green Days” as Ahmadinejad visited. This might be waving the white flag; it might simply be one instance of over-sensitivity. But it’s a remarkable one given that the visitor is Ahmadinejad and that many have understood his visit as a clear provocation against the unity government.
Perhaps Iran just operates in an alternate reality where every state should be nice to it and then graciously accept its punishment for doing so. That’s the only explanation for halting such a legitimate film screening in order to be considerate to a world leader coming to insult you.
In Iran, if you rob a candy shop, you get your hand cut off. In Lebanon, Ahmadinejad is sticking his hand in a cookie jar he has no right to touch—and the Lebanese government cuts off its own hand.

Researchers from Harvard and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory have engineered a mouse that can “smell” light, which offers a novel approach to studying the science of olfaction.
Published this week in the journal Nature Neuroscience, the study involved transgenic mice whose olfactory neurons are light-sensitive due to a protein called channelrhodoopsin-2.
Though the technique of using light-sensitive proteins to study the brain has existed for a few years, this is the first time that it was studied in the olfactory bulb, the part of the forebrain that detects smells, according to Venkatesh Murthy, a co-author of the paper and a professor of molecular and cellular biology.
“Most people can recognize that lemons, limes, and oranges smell differently, but at the same time they all belong to the citrus family,” Murthy said. “We want to understand how the brain discriminates between particular odors since...there isn’t a way to predict how a molecule smells just by its structure.”
Normally, only neurons that are connected to the retinas respond to light, but the mice were specially made so that the neurons in their olfactory bulbs would also respond when scientists shone light directly on them. This allowed the scientists to bypass the nose in order to study the behavior of the olfactory neurons.
Because smell, compared to sight and hearing, is a relatively slow sense, delivering the odor to the nose in a precise and timely fashion has always remained a challenge for neurobiologists.
The transgenic mice, Murthy said, solve that problem, since the scientists can deliver light in precisely timed bursts and intensities onto the neurons in the olfactory bulb.
The paper also highlights the usefulness of these special mice in studying how neurons code for information.
Neighboring neurons often carry redundant information as a safety net: in case one neuron is damaged, the message can still be relayed. The optimal neural system is one that allows for a balance between redundancy and maximal capacity to hold information, Murthy said.
According to Dinu F. Albeanu, a co-author of the paper and a CSHL fellow, the study examined whether neural outputs believed to be redundant actually serve distinct functions. From the firing patterns, the scientists determined that neurons use both spatial and temporal cues to transmit different information.
“For a particular smell, [neurons] can actually fire at different time points, and the split differences in timing can be used by the [brain] circuit to encode vital information as well,” Albeanu said.

Over 30 undergraduates discussed the role and practices of final clubs, from the punch process to safety at parties, at the first publicized meeting of an initiative that opposes the current state of the clubs held on Friday afternoon.
The campaign—which characterizes final clubs as unsafe, exclusive, and lacking in transparency—seeks to make on-campus social space more inclusive by asking students to steer clear of the clubs, calling on the College to make more space available for open student use, and demanding that the final clubs promote safer practices, including alcohol distribution.
“I think Harvard needs to take responsibility for the fact that its underage students are drinking,” said campaign co-organizer Seth A. Pearce ’12. “Do they want them to be drinking in spaces that they can control, or in spaces that they don’t have any control over?”
Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12, who attended the meeting and chairs a separate Undergraduate Council task force that is looking into social life at Harvard, echoed Pearce’s sentiment, saying the College should focus on making on-campus space like the Lowell Grille available for parties.
“The best thing we can do is to create new social spaces,” Coe-Odess said.
Over the course of the hour-long discussion in the Dunster House Junior Common Room, the conversation often returned to the topic of exclusivity, especially within the male final clubs.
“I think it should be more open, and there shouldn’t be enforcement of a gender ratio” at final club parties, said discussion attendee Alexandra L. L. Almore ’12.
College to include information on final clubs at freshman and sophomore orientations and, according to its statement of purpose, “make a public statement with an official position on final clubs.”
“In conversations you have with administrators, they may highlight some problematic aspects about final clubs, but they don’t publicly make statements about it,” initiative co-organizer Sabrina G. Lee ’12 said.
In an interview, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said that she supports all student groups and the students who participate in them—including both final clubs and groups that oppose them.
“If there is criticism among students about a group or organization, they should raise it,” Nelson said. “That’s what a college community is supposed to be about.”
The Office of Student Life does meet with the leaders of unrecognized student groups, including final clubs, fraternities, and sororities, just as they meet with leaders of recognized groups, according to Nelson.
“Our goal with the unrecognized groups is to give them information so that they can reduce harm to their own members and their guests around issues of substance abuse, hazing, and safe sexual health,” Nelson said.
All groups—including final clubs—are also required to sign and distribute state anti-hazing policies, she added.

Student activists from the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition elicited a response from President Barack Obama by staging a protest during the president’s speech at a rally for Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 in Boston this past Saturday.
The group used Obama’s appearance at this event in the Hynes Convention Center, which was explicitly held to support Patrick, as an opportunity to draw attention to the president’s promises to increase AIDS funding, made in his 2008 presidential campaign.
Marguerite Thorp ’11, one of the organizers of the protest, expressed concern that Obama had stated he would fund the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief with $50 billion over five years, but had only increased funding by a fraction of this target.
“The goal was really to take Obama off of [the speech’s intended] message to focus just for a second on an issue that is extremely important,” said HAC member Scott T. Gregg ’12.
The students waited until the president got on stage to uncover white t-shirts and hold up banners and posters that stated “Keep the Promise” and “$50 Billion for Global AIDS.”
When the president paused during his speech, the students chanted “Broken Promises Kill! Fund global AIDS!” and “You Promised More: $50 Billion!”
Obama tried to play off these interruptions by commenting that “One of the great things about being a Democrat is we like arguing with each other,” before telling protesters “Take a look at the what the Republican leadership has to say about that, because we increased AIDS funding.”
Harvard students from both the College and the Medical School—who were joined by a group of undergraduates from Dartmouth College—were escorted from the private event by security during Obama’s speech.
They resumed their protest outside the convention center, where the event was being held.
Abigail E. Schiff ’11 said that “although it was exciting because Obama did actually respond,” the funding increases the president referred to were “hardly at all what he had committed to.”
Members of the public who had waited in line for hours to get into the rally were generally unappreciative of the student demonstration.
The audience booed during the protesters’ chants. and attempted to drown them out with shouts of “Yes We Can” and “Four More Years.”
But some attendees reacted differently.
“They were expressing their rights as Americans,” rally attendee John Barruci said of the student protesters and demonstrations.

Harvard Medical School will expand and reorganize its immunology program with a new multifaceted initiative, according to a letter released by Dean of Faculty Jeffrey S. Flier to the Medical School community.
The effort aims to further implement the objectives of Flier’s Strategic Plan, which intends to focus cross-departmental research on modern science’s most pressing questions.
Flier said that the reorganization and expansion seeks to “augment interactions and collaboration among investigators with the ultimate goal of preventing and treating human illness.”
Flier’s letter details a new three-part program that will be based around the Harvard Committee on Immunology.
The Committee comprises about 100 faculty members who oversee Harvard’s graduate immunology department.
This committee will be accompanied by the newly-created Division of Immunology within the restructured Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology.
The final tier of the initiative is the Harvard Institute of Translational Immunology (HITI), which will take a multidisciplinary approach to the field of immunology and “train the next generation of translational and clinical immunologists.”
Additionally, the Helmsley Trust has funded a new pilot grant program—based out of HITI—that will devote its initial research to type 1 diabetes and Crohn’s disease.
In his letter, Flier wrote that the new initiatives will “enhance our understanding of fundamental immunologic mechanisms and help us translate basic science discoveries into clinical therapies, spurring progress in our mission to ease human suffering and eradicate disease.”

Speaking to a crowd of more than 15,000 people at the “Moving Massachusetts Forward” rally last Saturday, President Barack Obama urged voters to flock to the polls to reelect Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Lieutenant Governor Tim P. Murray on November 2.
The rally, which was held at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston, was sponsored by the Massachusetts Democratic Party and the Patrick-Murray campaign and featured a lineup of Democrats speaking in support of the incumbents.
With a little more than two weeks before the election, the rally sought to close the gap in enthusiasm between Democratic and Republican voters.
“This will be the largest get-out-the-vote operation in the history of this state, but only if you do your part,” Obama said.
According to Obama, Republicans have exploited the electorate’s frustration.
Republicans thought that if they “said no to policies that they have historically said yes to, they could ride peoples’ frustration and anger to the ballots,” Obama said.
The president added that “Deval Patrick chose to lead in the toughest of times.”
The rally reeled in 7,500 new volunteers who will “ensure that voters get out and vote for Deval Patrick and Tim Murray on election day,” according to a press release.
Obama said that a Democratic win would prevent the country from reverting to “backward” Republican ideas on jobs, education, and health care—areas where the Patrick-Murray administration has made significant strides, the president added.
“The biggest mistake we can make right now is, out of hurt and confusion, to go back to the past,” Obama said.
According to 10th-district congressional candidate James Kennedy—who also spoke at the rally—although Massachusetts ranked 48th nationally in manufacturing jobs four years ago, “[Patrick] led the state to the number-one recovering economy in the U.S.”
Steve Grossman, the Democratic candidate for state treasurer, said at the rally that the Patrick-Murray administration has been able to add 65,000 more jobs in the past seven months and that the state is now ranked as the fifth-best for business.
“We’re the ones who have the best ideas to create jobs. We stand for jobs. We stand for small businesses,” Grossman said.
According to Patrick, his state’s economy has been growing at twice the rate as the rest of the country since the recession.
“For the first time in 20 years, families are moving in the Commonwealth faster than they are moving out,” the governor said.
Applauding the Patrick-Murray administration for creating more jobs, Obama said that if Patrick’s Republican opponent Charlie Baker is elected, he will implement Republican ideas that are “not just a threat to our Democrats,” but “a threat to our democracy,” including tax schemes that favor the wealthiest of Americans.
According to a Suffolk University/7 News survey released last week, 46 percent of likely voters in Massachusetts back Patrick, and 39 percent support Baker in the traditionally Democratic state.
Noting that Republican candidates were planning to cut education funding by 20 percent, Obama also lauded the Patrick-Murray administration for leading Massachusetts to rank first nationally in education achievement and health care.
In the state, 97.5 percent of citizens have health insurance.
“We believe the government should do for the people what they cannot do better for themselves,” Obama said.
For Patrick, it was important that he and Murray “finish the job that [they] started,” since there is work to be done in education, job creation, and health care—particularly for senior citizens and veterans.
Looking back to the 16 years that Republicans occupied the governorship, Patrick added that “four years ago, we worked hard to change the guard.”
“Now we need to work hard to guard the change,” he continued.
Although not all Democrats have agreed with Patrick’s policy changes over the past four years, the governor defended his record, saying that these “times demand more than making each other comfortable.”
Echoing this sentiment, Murray said “we’ve made tough choices, and we’ve made the right choices,” adding that Massachusetts is the only state in the country to have added jobs since the recession.
“I don’t want to re-litigate the past; I don’t want to relive it,” Obama said, adding that “all of us together will rebuild the middle class and restore the American dream.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ’87 asked audience members to join in the fight for education reform at the Phillips Brooks House Association’s annual Robert Coles “Call of Service” Lecture and Award Friday night.
Duncan discussed racial inequalities in education, the need for education reform, as well as the importance of public service during his talk.
“If you can ride on the front of the bus, but you cannot read, you are not truly free,” he said.
Duncan lamented that many students who graduate from high school are not ready for college because they have been “socially promoted,” a term which refers to placing a student in the next grade despite their not being ready. A disproportionate number of these students are African American or Hispanic, said Duncan.
To address these inequalities, Duncan said that he and President Barack Obama are “making an unprecedented federal commitment to these areas.” The federal government’s $5 billion Race to the Top program funds efforts to accurately measure students’ progress in 44 states in order to ensure that students are on track for graduation and college.
“Our children have one chance, one chance to get a quality education, and they cannot wait,” Duncan said. “We remain too complacent about education reform.”
Duncan also discussed the importance of initiatives directed at college students who are committed to public service. To help these students, Obama and Duncan started the Income Based Repayment program in July 2009, which pays a student’s loans after they have completed 10 years of public service.
“It’s an opportunity to learn from others and enrich your own life while enriching the lives of others,” Duncan said.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds presented Duncan with the Robert Coles “Call of Service” Award and thanked him for his commitment to education.
Governor of Massachusetts Deval L. Patrick ’78 was also at the ceremony and introduced the honored guest, referencing Duncan’s time at Harvard and his co-captaincy of the basketball team.
The Robert Coles “Call of Service” Lecture and Award was established in 2007 to honor a leader in public service and bring him or her to the College to inspire students to become more involved in service at Harvard and in the community. Past recipients have included Al Gore in 2008 and Geoffrey Canada in 2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A petition from Cambridge citizens’ group Save Our Skyline has collected enough signatures to force the Cambridge City Council to reconsider a recent decision allowing an increase in the height limit of building signs in Cambridge.
The disputed regulation, which passed 6-3 in a Council meeting on Sept. 27, also repealed the “variance process”—a procedure that grants exemptions to sign limits.
Save Our Skyline alleges that the new regulation will lead to “a proliferation of unwanted corporate signs,” wrote spokeswoman Karen Schwartzman in an e-mail.
Last Friday, the coalition turned in 15,581 signatures to the City Council, double the number required for a petition to be considered. Save Our Skyline said that it would continue gathering signatures “to enable all registered voters in Cambridge who wish to express their opinion on this issue to do so,” Schwartzman wrote.
If the signatures are validated and certified, the Council will either repeal the amendment or put the issue on the ballot for voters to decide.
Although only registered voters were allowed to sign the petition, the canvassers had registration materials in case they came across “anyone who is unregistered and wants to sign the petition,” Schwartzman wrote.
Despite its popularity, Save Our Skyline faces accusations of misinformation from city officials.
In its campaign against the new regulation, Save Our Skyline has criticized the City Council for allowing signs that have “natural or external illumination.” However, externally lit signs were allowed in Cambridge before the new regulation, according to City Councilor Leland Cheung.
Contrary to Save Our Skyline’s charge, the Council’s decision actually strengthened sign regulation by no longer allowing internal illumination, according to James J. Rafferty, an attorney who has dealt with zoning issues for two decades.
Before the Council passed the regulation, Rafferty presented the Council with a letter citing a 50-square foot sign along the Charles River with internal illumination, suggesting that the contested regulation is actually more stringent than the old one.
Under the new regulation, “they would not be allowed...as only external illumination is permitted,” Rafferty said in his letter.

A high-profile Harvard stem cell study published earlier this year was recently retracted from the journal Nature due to “serious concerns with some of the reported data,” according to the retraction.
The official statement, issued Oct. 13, was signed by three of the four authors including Amy J. Wagers, the study’s principle investigator and associate professor of stem cell and regenerative biology at Harvard Medical School.
By connecting the circulatory systems of old and young mice, the study claimed that the younger mice’s blood contained compounds that could rejuvenate blood stem cells in the older mice, a discovery which suggested that the process of aging could be slowed or even reversed with environmental changes.
Wagers and two of the other authors wrote last week that “concerns have undermined the authors’ confidence in the support for the scientific conclusions reported, specifically the role of osteopontin-positive niche cells in the rejuvenation of haematopoietic stem cells in aged mice.”
The retraction added that the investigation into the results is still ongoing. The original paper, published on January 28, has already been cited 13 times, according to the Web of Science online citation index.
Shane R. Mayack, the lead author and a former post-doctoral fellow in the Wagers Lab, was the sole author not to sign the retraction, maintaining that the results are accurate, according to the statement. Mayack left the Medical School-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center, where the Wagers Lab is located, on Oct. 1, according to its website.
Last Friday, editors of the journal Blood posted a “notice of concern” on its website regarding an older paper published by Mayack and Wagers. This paper, published in 2008 about the role of bone cells in stem cell rejuvenation, included a flow cytometry plot that appeared to be identical to the one in the retracted paper. Blood’s website states that an internal review into the reported data of this paper is underway.
“Any concerns brought to our attention are thoroughly reviewed in accordance with institutional policies and applicable regulations,” wrote the HMS Dean of Research Integrity Gretchen Brodnicki in an email.
The paper’s authors did not respond to requests for comment.

Kettle corn, kale chips, and live music abounded at the Harvard Community Garden’s Harvest Festival, organized to celebrate the end of the garden’s first successful growing season since it was first opened last April.
The three-hour festival was hosted Saturday by the Harvard Community Garden staff and in the garden located on Mt. Auburn Street near Lowell House.
Community members attended the festival, bringing along with them their diverse musical talents and a variety of organic food.
Louisa C. Denison ’11, one of the co-heads of the Harvard Community Garden, put on a performance with her quartet, “Plump Concord,” and a food truck from a soon-to-be-opened restaurant near Harvard Square, Clover Food, sold organic foods made by the Clover Food team.
The festival featured produce from both the garden and local farms, including baked kale chips from the garden and apple cider made on site with apples from Lanni Orchards. Visitors also had a chance to learn about the foods grown in the garden and had a chance to explore the garden beds full of radishes, eggplants, serrano peppers, and other vegetables.
Garden staff members were available to tell visitors about the group’s plans for the garden’s produce and to make them aware of opportunities to volunteer.
Francisco J. Maldonado ’14, one of the volunteers, said that the staff  has not “structured a really efficient way of managing produce so far.”
There are plans to donate some of the food to the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and open a community shop next year that would make organic food accessible and affordable, Maldonado said.
The majority of food grown in the garden is sold to Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services and featured at Faculty Club, according to Kathleen Frith, acting director of the garden.
Cohen said that the committee overseeing the garden hoped to double its size in the near future, taking of advantage of existing land next to the garden.
The all-volunteer staff has been tending to the garden since last spring.
The raised-bed garden was conceived as a collaborative between several University groups, including the Environmental Action Committee, Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, Office for Sustainability, and Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services’ Food Literacy Project. The garden aims to create community awareness about the role of food in the environment and its effect on people’s health.
Since last spring, the garden has seen some setbacks, such as the vandalism of several of the plant beds and the theft of the garden’s banner.
According to Rebecca J. Cohen ’12, the setbacks have been relatively minor.
“Overall it’s been an overwhelming success,” Cohen said “The response from the community has been so positive.”

CORRECTION: October 19, 2010
An earlier version of the Oct. 18 news article "Garden Celebrates First Fall Harvest" incorrectly stated that the community garden was conceived as an effort led by the Food  Literacy Project. In fact, it was a  collaborative effort between several University groups, including the  Environmental Action Committee, Center for Health and the  Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, Office for Sustainability, and FLP.

While research has highlighted the correlation between tanning and skin cancer, a Harvard study published last week describes a way to stimulate a natural tanning process that reduces the risk of skin cancer, or melanoma.
The study points to the possibility of creating a drug that increases the production of melanin—a natural substance that causes pigmentation in hair and skin—in fair-skinned individuals, inducing these people to tan as a cancer prevention strategy.
Melanin naturally blocks ultraviolet radiation, which is known to cause melanoma.
Harvard Medical School Professor David E. Fisher—who was the lead researcher of the study—identified the regulator of melanin production as the enzyme PDE-4D3.
“When we studied how PDE worked, it became immediately clear to us exactly that it was the mechanism blocking pigmentation,” said Fisher, who also directs the Massachusetts General Hospital’s Department of Dermatology.
“If you were designing a way to auto-regulate an enzyme, it would make perfect sense to limit the pigmentation response to go out of control,” he added.
Studying a group of genetically-altered mice with fair skin and red hair, the researchers identified PDE-4D3 as a “molecular switch” that inhibits the protein—cyclic AMP (cAMP)—that causes pigmentation. The researchers discovered that a drug may be able to induce pigmentation by obstructing PDE-4D3’s inhibition of cAMP.
“By coincidence, this is something that can be druggable,” Fisher said.
According to Fisher, the ideal drug would be directly applied to the skin. Compared to oral medications, topical drugs have relatively minor side effects and avoid potential damage to vital organs.
He added that such a drug should be seen “not [as] a cosmetic one, but a skin cancer protection strategy,” and that the target population of the drug would primarily comprise people with fair skin who have difficulty tanning or who sunburn easily.
Researchers said they hope the potential drug will deter people from engaging in behaviors that increase the possibility of skin cancer, including artificial tanning.
“Melanoma is undergoing an increase greater than any other cancer in America,” Fisher said, calling the trend “an extremely frustrating statistic” in light of readily available knowledge about UV exposure’s correlation with skin cancer.
Fisher added that the drug could be developed within the next five to 10 years.

Students from the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR), the peer support hotline RESPONSE, and other peer counseling groups knocked on the doors of upperclassmen Houses yesterday to ask residents to hang a purple ribbon in observance of Domestic Violence Awareness Month.
The initiative, dubbed the “Purple Door Campaign,” aims to educate students on domestic and dating violence, and to motivate them to promote healthy relationships, according to the campaign’s organizers.
“The idea is to make a very visible united statement on campus,” Director of OSAPR Sarah A. Rankin said.
In addition to hanging up ribbons, volunteers talked to students and distributed information about safe relationships that included resources for dealing with and helping others face domestic or dating violence.
“People who answered their doors were really supportive,” said Genevieve A. Lim ’12, an OSAPR volunteer and co-coordinator of the Purple Door Campaign. “A bunch of guys even said, ‘Who would say no to that?’”
Rankin said that students were similarly receptive when the initiative first began last year, adding that they appreciated the time-intensive task of bringing information to their doors.
“When students are doing the knocking and talking, that’s very powerful—much more than if it were OSAPR staff,” Rankin said. She added that students don’t always think of domestic and relationship violence as falling in the same realm as sexual assault, and that OSAPR faces a challenge with the words “sexual assault” in its title.
“Because that’s what we’re called, sexual assault is the majority of what we see,” she said. “But it’s also a place for students who have concerns about abusive relationships or being harassed or stalked by a person after a breakup, which are not uncommon on college campuses, including Harvard.”
Shannon E. Cleary ’12, a member of the OSAPR Alliance and the Purple Door Campaign’s other co-coordinator, echoed the idea that students often think of domestic violence as something irrelevant to life in college.
“When people hear the words ‘domestic violence,’ they often think of adults or people outside of college,” she said, adding that domestic violence encompasses dating violence as well as emotional and physical forms of harassment.
“It does happen on our campus, and it’s something people should be aware of for themselves and for their friends to make sure people are healthy and happy,” Cleary said.
Students are also recognizing Domestic Violence Awareness Month with a display in front of the Science Center this week, which will include a large canvas painted with the words, “These Hands are Not for Hurting,” as well as space for passersby to trace their hands and write positive messages.
“The slogan seems like it should be something really simple, like you learned in kindergarten,” Cleary said. “But that lesson of ‘don’t hit’ is so simple that seeing it spelled out really makes you stop and think.”

A freshman urgently called his mother to inform her of a failed midterm, igniting her fears that he would need to drop out of Harvard.
After the audience’s laughter subsided, representatives from the Bureau of Study Counsel and the Freshman Dean’s Office offered parents advice on how to deal with such a situation—which was part of a skit performed by The Immediate Gratification Players during the opening ceremony of Freshman Parents Weekend.
This weekend provided hundreds of parents, proudly wearing their crimson Harvard parent pins, an opportunity to sit in on their children’s classes, cheer for Harvard during the Harvard vs. Lehigh University football game, and hear from U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ’87 on the importance of community service.
Harvard President Drew G. Faust and  College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds welcomed parents in speeches that highlighted the importance of finding one’s passion during the college years, even if that passion differs from parents’ expectations or notions developed in high school.
Following the remarks, IGP presented the sketches that showcased common interactions between students and parents and were subject to advice and analysis by representatives of several University and College offices that provide resources to students.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 then led a question-and-answer session, during which parents voiced their concerns over the recent Memorial Church suicide and the disparity between resources available to students with and without financial aid.
Nevertheless, most parents said they appreciated the broad scope of Harvard’s resources.
“I now realize how amazing the resources available to students really are,” Denis N. Houser said. “Have you heard of the libraries’ scan-and-deliver service? That’s amazing!”
“The events really go to the core of the Harvard experience,” added his wife, Linda L. Houser.
Dennis M. Lindeborg said he appreciated the work of the FDO and reminisced about his college days.
“You put yourself back into the shoes of your 18-year-old self and think, ‘I’d love to do this’. You end up living vicariously through your children,” he said.
Dingman said that many parents echoed Lindeborg’s sentiments.
“Many parents I spoke to were very envious of their children,” he said. “Parents wanted to know if there were opportunities for them to enroll as well.”
The weekend has existed for at least 35 years, Dingman added.
Many parents’ feedback was markedly positive. Carla Castillo succinctly summarized her opinions of the weekend.
“Of course Harvard does something like this right,” she said. “It’s Harvard.”

Business professionals from several countries and a wide variety of fields spent two days last week discussing integrated reporting—a means of conveying companies’ non-financial performance, in addition to traditional financial information—at Harvard Business School last week during a conference organized by Business School Professor Robert G. Eccles,
Eccles, an advocate for the adoption of integrated reporting, has co-written a book on the topic, and is a founding member of the International Integrated Reporting Committee, which promotes the practice.
Corporations that adopt this method of reporting combine financial, environmental, and other performance information into one annual report intended to allow stakeholders to judge a company by more than its profitability.
Delivering the conference’s welcome address, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria expressed his frustration that the public’s perception of business leaders has become less favorable over the past few years, but said that integrated reporting would be one way to help restore that confidence.
Eccles said that the practice also had the potential to change how companies perceive themselves.
“Once you make the commitment to sustainable reporting, it starts to change the way you see yourselves as a company,” he said. “This gets at the fundamental question: are companies here just to serve shareholders?”
Beiting Cheng ’09, a Business School doctoral candidate who helped plan the event, said she was pleased at the conference’s ability to foster collaboration on this issue among business leaders who would not ordinarily interact. The conference included representatives from accounting firms, consulting firms, investment houses, and other corporations.
Over 100 attendees had the opportunity to discuss the challenges of implementing integrated reporting and to look at case studies of companies that have already adopted the practice.
The practice has been institutionalized in South African companies, where companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange are required to publish integrated reports.
Marilee McInnis, public relations manager for Southwest Airlines—one of the few  American companies to have already created an integrated annual report—said the airline did so as part of its philosophy that puts employees first, customers second, and shareholders third. Still, she said, an integrated report is important for investors.

If this were any other football program, the Crimson would have been written off a few weeks ago. When a team is embarrassingly upset in its Ivy opener and then proceeds to lose starter after starter to injury in the days that follow, that’s often enough for the naysayers’ voices to rise up and herald the early end of a promising season.
But this isn’t any football program. This is Harvard, and despite the team’s personnel struggles and 3-2 record, the Crimson is still coming out every week with a target on its back.
“I have so much respect for [Harvard coach] Tim Murphy and this football program here,” Lehigh coach Andy Coen said. “I think it’s become a neat little rivalry for us, and we’d love to get back to playing Harvard down the road. So it means a lot to me that we were able to beat Harvard.”
It seems that every week in the postgame press conference, everyone’s got a lot of respect for the Crimson. And it’s a respect that’s well-earned, since Harvard had the second-best winning percentage in the FCS in the last decade (.768), second only to the University of Montana.
But right now, that respect is coming back to bite the Crimson a little bit, because dinged up as Harvard may be, no opponent will overlook it.
Just 12 of the 22 positional starters in the season-opening win against Holy Cross were in the starting lineup on Saturday. The Crimson has been without seniors quarterback Andrew Hatch and wideout Chris Lorditch for three games, senior receiver Marco Iannuzzi, junior linebacker Blaise Deal, and sophomore cornerback D.J. Monroe for two games, and junior corner Matt Hanson joined the street-clothes crew on Saturday. Throw in the preseason loss of incumbent starting quarterback Collier Winters, and it’s impressive that Harvard is 3-2—and arguably should be 4-1—today.
The one unit on defense that hasn’t been affected by injury is the line, which still has the same starting four as it did against Holy Cross. But in the third quarter, the defensive line couldn’t get to Lehigh signal callers Chris Lum and Mike Colvin, making the job of the depleted linebackers and secondary much more difficult.
“We were undisciplined, and...we can’t relinquish a 17-point lead like that in the third quarter,” senior tackle Chuks Obi said. “We gave up three touchdowns in the third quarter, and that’s unacceptable. And that’s because of a combination of penalties and also not getting to the quarterback on the pass rush.”
As Murphy has said, the lines both on offense and defense have been the anchor of the team through the turmoil of injuries, and they will have to continue to do the same as the season goes on if Harvard is to find success. The offensive line did its job well on Saturday, and for three out of four quarters, so did the defense. But with a short bench, the Crimson no longer has the luxury of taking any quarters off.
“Personnel-wise, we’re not exactly the same team we were at the beginning of the year,” Murphy said. “And we can still beat anyone, but the margin for error is much less.”
While the Crimson is far from the only Ivy team to be battered by injuries, that doesn’t make it easier to look ahead to a November schedule that includes home games with Columbia (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) and Yale (4-1, 2-0) and a road trip to face defending champion Penn (4-1, 2-0). The Quakers have been just as good as they were last season, when they went undefeated in the Ancient Eight to win the crown.
Harvard is a team with plenty of depth, and on any given Saturday, it has the potential to beat whichever team it runs up against on the gridiron. The Crimson should still be in the title hunt when it heads to Philadelphia, particularly if Hatch and some of his supporting cast are able to make an effective return to form. But if it makes a habit of coughing up big halftime leads, you can kiss that chance at an Ivy title goodbye.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Football is a team sport, but once in a while, one player steps up to provide that extra push for his team to overcome its opponents and grab the win. Saturday afternoon at Harvard Stadium, Lehigh sophomore wide receiver Ryan Spadola managed to do just that with his performance, propelling the visiting Mountain Hawks to a victory over the Crimson.
Spadola, Lehigh’s leading receiver, scored his first career touchdown in his previous game against Fordham but was held to just 33 yards on three catches in the first half against Harvard. It was a completely different story for the sophomore in the second half.
“When you get three, four, five wide receivers out there, it’s very difficult to double or triple a guy,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said, “especially when we had kept them relatively bottled up in the first half.”
The Mountain Hawks’ first drive of the third quarter featured Spadola almost exclusively, ending with his four-yard touchdown catch in the back of the endzone. Spadola also had a hand in the visitors’ next drive, hauling in a short pass and running 22 yards to the one-yard line, setting up his team’s second touchdown of the afternoon.
Lehigh’s third drive after halftime would prove no different, but this time, it was all Spadola’s doing. On second and 10, the sophomore ran a near-perfect post route and, upon finding a hole in the Harvard secondary, sprinted 51 yards to the endzone virtually untouched.
“I saw it was man coverage on one of their second-string [corners],” Spadola said, “so I just had to beat him. I made sure I had time to get open, and me and [quarterback Chris Lum] were just on the same page.”
Spadola had 159 yards on nine catches in the third quarter alone and finished the day with 206 yards on 14 catches and two touchdowns, more than doubling his career total.
“This was certainly a breakout day for him,” said Mountain Hawk coach Andy Coen. “He’ll be the first to tell you he’s got to keep working. But...we’re obviously thrilled to have him on our football team.”
WINDY WEATHER
Football is played with 22 players on the field at a time—11 per team—and having any more than that on the field is always penalized. But on Saturday, there was an extra man on the field who definitely had a profound effect on the game: the wind.
“The wind is a factor,” Coen said, “and it could be a factor in every ballgame, so you have to be ready to account for it.”
Special teams took a huge hit in their effectiveness due to the weather. The day was best represented by a play in the third quarter, when Crimson punter Jake Dombrowski’s kick into the wind was caught by the gusts and spiraled out of control. The result: a net gain of zero yards.
But the wind also provided an opportunity for both offenses. Unfortunately for Harvard, only the visitors were able to capitalize on their chances.
With the wind at their backs in the third quarter, the Mountain Hawks gained a total of 195 yards in the air, a big difference from their 94 passing yards from the first half. With the help of this offensive explosion from its passing game, Lehigh was able to score on three consecutive drives, mounting a comeback that would prove to be just enough to knock off the Crimson.
“They maxed out the third-quarter wind advantage,” Murphy said. “They threw the ball extremely well, and we just couldn’t come up with the play to keep them out of the endzone.”
CALL OF THE DAY
With only a couple of minutes to go in the fourth quarter and Harvard down by four, the home team needed to score a touchdown in order to have a chance at winning the game.
After converting on fourth down, Crimson sophomore quarterback Colton Chapple threw a 28-yard strike to senior wide receiver Mike Cook, who appeared to land with both feet in the endzone. But the referee saw otherwise and ruled Cook out of bounds, resulting in an incomplete pass.
“[The ref] ruled it out of bounds,” Murphy said. “We won’t know until we see the film. I looked on the replay, and it looked like he was in. But again, that’s one play in a game. We had a lot of other opportunities. That was a big play, but we had a lot of other opportunities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than two minutes left on the clock, sophomore quarterback Colton Chapple stepped right and lofted a pass deep down the field. The ball rode the 25-mile per hour winds all the way to the endzone, where senior Mike Cook hauled in the pass. The receiver planted his feet by the sideline and launched into celebration after the apparent touchdown catch had vaulted Harvard into the lead.
But the referee saw it differently, and a minute after Cook was ruled out of bounds, Lehigh quarterback Chris Lum was taking a knee, icing the game and cementing a number of what-ifs on a day that the Crimson came up just short.
Harvard football fell to Lehigh, 21-19, at Harvard Stadium on Saturday after a pair of 30-minute halves that didn’t resemble each other at all. The Crimson rode a 17-0 lead into the locker room at the break behind solid defensive play and a few big runs from senior Gino Gordon. But the second half was a different story, as the Mountain Hawks emerged the more prepared squad.
“Our first half of football...was not a very pretty one,” Lehigh coach Andy Coen said. “We didn’t tackle very well, we didn’t execute the offense the way we’re capable of, and we had to pick ourselves up at halftime. And we came out in the third quarter and obviously responded very, very well.”
Behind Lum, Lehigh carved up the injury-riddled Crimson secondary with 195 yards passing in the third quarter—finishing the day with more than 300 yards in the air.
And suddenly Harvard was in danger of relinquishing a 17-point lead for the first time since 2000.
“With regards to [passing], they did some things that worked pretty well against what we were doing,” said captain and safety Collin Zych. “But give [Lehigh] credit, they made plays when they needed to.”
Early on, it was the Crimson that made all the plays. After opening the game with a defensive three-and-out, Harvard drove 49 yards before rookie David Mothander booted home a 38-yard field goal for the 3-0 advantage. The Crimson followed up with a forced fumble, as senior Chuks Obi knocked the ball loose from Mountain Hawk running back Jay Campbell, and, two plays later, the offensive line had such a good seal on the left side that Gordon scampered 18 yards untouched into the endzone.
“We gave up some big plays in the run game, largely due to missed tackles,” Coen said. “Gino Gordon I think is a fabulous back...he’s proved that here.”
But Gordon, who finished with 118 yards on 22 carries, was far from the only weapon working for Harvard.
Chapple found a rhythm with two of his emerging favorite targets, sophomore tight end Kyle Juszczyk and junior wideout Adam Chrissis. The pair finished with 58 and 55 yards receiving, respectively, to lead the Crimson, and Juszczyk’s 17-yard reception off a playaction pass from Chapple staked Harvard to a 17-0 lead.
After the Crimson defense stifled Lehigh for the remainder of the half—adding a missed field goal and another forced fumble to preserve the shutout—the home team appeared to head to the locker room on cruise control.
“Obviously [the game was] a tale of two halves,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I was not unhappy with our effort, but in the end we just did not make enough plays.”
Indeed, from the very beginning of the third quarter, momentum seemed to shift in the Mountain Hawks’ favor.
“I think it first started with the opening kickoff,” Lehigh receiver Ryan Spadola said. “[Linebacker] Jerard Gordon had a huge hit on the returner, and I think that sparked everybody.”
Certainly, Spadola got the message. The sophomore receiver exploded in the third quarter, hauling in nine passes for 159 yards and a pair of scores on just three drives. Spadola grabbed the Mountain Hawks’ first touchdown of the day on a four-yard reception before capping off the quarter with a 51-yard catch-and-run on a post route that put Lehigh ahead, 21-17. Spadola finished the day with a career-high 206 receiving yards.
“We just came out in the second half, and we just wanted this game,” Spadola said. “We took advantage of every opportunity, and when our numbers were called...we took advantage and made plays.”
The sudden 21-point turnaround left the Crimson sputtering. Harvard got the strong wind at its back for the final period and hoped to take advantage, but the squad could not muster a promising drive until just over three minutes remained.
Following a failed fake punt by the Mountain Hawks, the Crimson took over at its own 37 and moved to the Lehigh 28 after a big fourth-down reception from Chrissis. On the next play, Chapple appeared to hit Cook for the game-winning score, but instead, Harvard just faced second and 10.
“[The referee] ruled it out of bounds,” Murphy said. “We won’t know until we see the film.”
Two plays later, Chapple’s fourth-down desperation throw found the arms of a Lehigh defender, and Harvard was left with a difficult loss.  An intentional safety from the Mountain Hawks brought the final score to 21-19, but the Crimson was already looking ahead to the rest of its Ivy slate.
“I’m not in the least bit concerned about [bouncing back],” Murphy said, “I’m really not.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than two weeks to go before the cross country Heptagonal Championships, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams headed out to Terre Haute, Ind., on Saturday to face some of the nation’s best competition at the Indiana State Pre-Nationals Meet.
Both the men and women posted strong results, placing 17th out of 36 teams, and 16th out of 40 teams, respectively.
“I was really pleased with how both teams did overall,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “The meet was a good step for us in the right direction, and we feel really confident about where we’re at heading into Heps, Regionals, and Nationals.”
A day earlier, several members of men’s and women’s teams participated in the Brown Invitational in East Greenwich, R.I.
The meet provided a good opportunity for Harvard to face some talented local competition. The men finished right behind the host Bears to claim second place while the women finished fifth.
PRE-NATIONALS
Facing 35 other teams in the “white” division—including 10 teams in the top 30 of the nation—a young men’s squad took on some stiff competition in its attempt to top last year’s 23rd-place finish.
Leading the way for the men was captain Dan Chenoweth, who finished the 8k course in third place with a time of 23:32.7. The senior finished just one second behind runner-up Ryan Hill of North Carolina State.
“Dan is a great competitor,” Saretsky said. “He knows how to put himself in a position where it matters. It’s a long five miles, and he does a great job spreading out his energy so he’s ready to go when the race really starts to heat up.”
The next Crimson runner to cross the finish line was Michael Hoffman. The sophomore’s time of 24.59.3 was good enough for a 97th-place finish. Rounding out the top five Harvard runners in the meet were rookies Maksim Korolev, Aaron Watanabe, and Kurt Ruegg. The three young runners placed 99th, 134th, and 135th, respectively.
“I thought that the freshmen were doing a great job,” Saretsky said. “We’re a very young team, so we’ve had growing pains, but they’re really starting to round into form, and some great things will happen here if they continue to work hard and stay focused.”
Coming off of a sixth-place finish at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational, the women’s team rode a wave of momentum and its newly-acquired No. 31 national ranking into the Pre-Nationals meet. The Crimson did not disappoint, finishing a respectable 16th place out of the 40 teams it faced in the “white” division—eight of which are currently in the nation’s top-30 teams.
“It was another strong performance for the women,” Saretsky said. “They faced ranked teams in Florida, and some powerhouses in Georgia and Kansas. I was particularly pleased with how much [juniors] Jeanne [Mack] and Nicole [Cochran] improved from last year.”
“We didn’t run our typical top seven, so I thought that we competed pretty well for what we were given,” Cochran said.
Mack led all Harvard runners with a 36th-place overall finish in the 6K race, crossing the line with a time of 21:06.9. Sophomore Sammy Silva and Cochran also fared well, with their times of 21:06.9 and 21:25.4 good enough for 55th and 59th place overall, respectively.
“I think we’re in a good position,” Cochran said. “We’re running a lot better than we have in the past few years. We’re setting aside our individual goals to run for the team. Everybody’s excited to go for a run and work out.”
BROWN INVITATIONAL
While many members of the men’s and women’s cross country squads jumped on a plane to Indiana, Saretsky kept the rest of his runners fairly close to home to compete in the Brown Invitational last Friday. The meet brought several teams together from all over New England, including Brown, Rhode Island, Bryant University, UMass, and UConn.
“A good portion of our runners in this meet were middle-distance runners,” Saretsky said. “Cross country isn’t necessarily their focus, so the fast, flat course at Brown was really conducive to them going out and taking a step forward in their cross country training.”
Freshman Paul Koullick led the Crimson men with an eighth-place finish overall, clocking in at 26:06.10, while sophomore Jakob Lindaas followed right behind him, taking ninth place with a time of 26:12.60.
The two runners’ solid times helped Harvard take second in a field of four teams.
On the women’s side, junior Kristen Jorgensen set the pace for the Crimson, crossing the finish line in 18:18.20 to take 13th overall.
Captain Eliza Ives and freshman Morgan Kelly weren’t far behind, as their times of 18:26.70 and 18:36.40 garnered them 15th- and 22nd-place finishes, respectively, out of a field of 92 runners.
“Going to Brown, where you’re in the top 10 and top 20, is always a great opportunity to get a boost in confidence as you get ready for Heps,” Saretsky said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the leaves are still browning into their autumnal hue, the fall season is already over for the men’s golf team. Harvard traveled to Charlestown, R.I., this weekend for its final event of the season, the Northeast Invitational at the Shelter Harbor Golf Club.
Billed as a preview to the Ivy Championships in the spring, the tournament featured 16 teams, including all of the Ancient Eight.
Due to consistent play, the Crimson took second place in the event, topped only by three-time defending conference champion Columbia.
“We were happy with how we played,” junior captain Tony Grillo said.
After a 12th-place finish at the Big 5 Invitational last week and seventh-place finishes in the MacDonald Cup and the McLaughlin earlier this season, Harvard came into the tournament looking to finally showcase its depth. It got what it wanted as Grillo and freshmen Seiji Liu and Theo Lederhausen finished in the top 20 individually.
“[Liu and Lederhausen] have been playing fairly solid all year,” Grillo said. “As far as myself, I just started hitting the shots I was trying to hit.”
Liu shot a +8 on the tournament, bouncing back from a 77 in the opening round to fire a 73 yesterday and tie for 19th place. Lederhausen finished +4—good enough to tie for seventh place—thanks to a 74 on Saturday and a team-low 72 to close out the tournament.
“We have the experience [of playing difficult courses in tough conditions],” Liu said of himself and Lederhausen. “We know how to grind it out and put up a number. It might not be pretty, but we can still put up a good number.”
But Grillo outshined the freshmen. The captain shot even par to open the tournament, with 16 pars, a birdie, and a bogey on Saturday. He finished the day one stroke behind URI’s Taylor Fontaine at the top of the leader board—a performance all the more impressive because it took place in horrible conditions.
“In the first round, [the temperature] was low 40s, and the wind was blowing 35 miles an hour,” Liu said. “It was a test of survival.”
Yesterday, Grillo picked up right where he left off, and, had it not been for a triple bogey on the 10th hole, he might have won the tournament. Nonetheless, the junior finished the afternoon with a 73 for a two-day total of 144, tied with Fontaine and Navy’s Ben Hayes and one stroke behind Dartmouth’s James Pleat and Hartford’s Matt Smith, who tied for first place.
Grillo’s classmates Connor Wentzell and Mark Pollak struggled in the conditions, carding a 157 and 163, respectively.
“It was mostly because of the extremely crazy weather,” Liu said of his teammates’ difficulties.
Regardless of the weather, Shelter Harbor itself proved to be a challenge.
“You had to be conservative on almost every shot,” Liu said. “One wayward shot could destroy your round because there were a lot of stone walls, boulders, fescue, long rough. You name it—there were a lot of things the designers put up there to minimize your chance of doing well.”
As a team, Harvard came in second with 597 strokes, nine shots behind the first-place Lions. Penn finished in third with a 598, and the Midshipmen (601), Big Green (603), and Hawks (603) rounded out the top five.
“It takes a fourth or fifth guy playing well to win a tournament,” Grillo said. “That’s what kept us from winning this week, even though three of us played fairly well.”
Out of the remaining Ivies, Princeton tied for eighth, Cornell finished in 10th, Yale tied for 11th, and Brown came in 13th. The event provided a glimpse into the spring when the Ancient Eight will come together to determine a league champion.
“This is a very big way for us to end the season,” Liu said. “We’re a lot more confident of ourselves now and know that, if everyone plays well, we can win almost any tournament.”
“We know that we’re good enough to win Ivies this year,” Grillo said. “Columbia was on [this weekend]. They’ve won [the Ivy Championship] the past three years, so we definitely know they’re the one we have to get.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference a couple of hours can make.
The Harvard men’s water polo team traveled to Brooklyn Heights, N.Y. and New London, Conn. this weekend, facing tough competition but coming out of the battles with two wins.
The Crimson (8-13, 2-4 CWPA North) suffered its worst defeat of the season, going down, 23-7, to the No. 15 St. Francis Terriers, but then turned the momentum around to pull off victories against Queens a few hours later that day and Connecticut College yesterday.
It was the second time this season the Crimson has won back-to-back games, the first time being a quadruple-overtime win against MIT and a 12-8 triumph over Occidental.
“I think overall it was a good team performance this weekend,” co-captain Bret Voith said. “The loss against St. Francis was one of our worst losses of the season, but I think we had a strong team performance against the other two teams.”
HARVARD 20, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 10
Harvard continued its turnaround from the first loss of the weekend by dominating Connecticut College (2-8, 0-7) by a score of 20-10 yesterday in New London.
The offense led the team in the match, posting its second-biggest scoring output of the season. Junior Kevin DiSilvestro led the team with six goals, followed by senior Jeff Lee and senior Alex Thompson with three scores apiece. Junior Alex Popp had nine saves for the game.
HARVARD 15, QUEENS 11
After a tough loss earlier Saturday, the Crimson regrouped to edge out the win, 15-11, over Queens (6-8, 2-4). The defense was key in stopping the Knights’ offense from taking the match. Freshman Jimmy Field made 10 saves and Popp had six saves for the game.
Junior co-captain Luka Babic stepped up for the team in a major way. He fired five shots past the Queens goalie to lead his team in scoring. Junior Evan Zepfel, who is also a Crimson sports editor, and Thompson were also impressive for the squad, scoring three and two goals, respectively.
“We had a team meeting and had to stress the importance of focusing on the here and now despite the loss,” co-captain Bret Voith said. “Those games were must-wins to get us into contention for standing purposes.”
NO. 15 ST. FRANCIS 23, HARVARD 7
The Crimson opened the weekend with a loss to St. Francis (17-3, 6-0). The Terriers broke free early in the game, leaving Harvard behind, 9-3, at the half. Harvard had the opportunity to come back after the break, but St. Francis completely dominated the third quarter. The Terriers scored eight goals to the Crimson’s zero and gained a 17-3 advantage heading into the fourth quarter.
“I think we weren’t doing what we were coached to do,” Popp said. “[The Terriers] let off a lot of shots in that quarter, and we weren’t pressing up enough.”
Harvard managed to put up a few more points, but ultimately fell, 23-7. It was the team’s fourth loss in a row and third loss in a row on the road. Junior Mike Katzer led the team with two goals and Popp had 13 saves, his high for the weekend.
Next up on the Harvard schedule is a familiar and nearby opponent. The Crimson travels to play at MIT this Friday.
“We need to play team defense against MIT,” Popp said. “If we come out and play four quarters and all have each others’ backs, then I’m confident we can pull out the win.”
But Harvard does not have much time. After taking on MIT, the squad then heads to Princeton, N.J. for the Ivy Championships before rounding out the season with the CWPA Northern Division Championships and CWPA Eastern Championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a busy Saturday night for the Harvard men’s soccer team as a strong Brown contingent gave the Crimson a handful of troubles.
Harvard (4-3-5, 1-0-2 Ivy) escaped Providence, R.I. with a 0-0 draw despite being outshot by the No. 15 Bears (7-1-3, 1-1-1 Ivy), 25-6. Junior goalkeeper Austin Harms was forced to bail out the Crimson six times throughout the night while rival goalie Paul Grandstand had a relatively effortless outing, having only one save in the game.
“I thought the first 15 minutes we were very dangerous, and we could have gone ahead one- or two-nothing,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “But there was nearly a 60-minute stretch where if one of the teams was going to score, it was going to be Brown.”
The hosts came out running, testing Harms right away in the first 23 minutes of the game. The Bears clawed at the goal with seven shots, two of which were on net, but Harms denied Brown to keep his team in the game. Bears forward Sean Rosa had a great look with 22:26 already played when he let out a rocket towards the bottom right corner of the goal, but Harms dove to keep it out.
Rosa and Brown midfielders Thomas McNamara and Taylor Gorman each had five shots on the night, with one shot on target apiece.
“I do remember one or two shots from Brown that did attack our goal, but I thought that we were able to possess the ball in our defensive half of the field,” Junot said. “We also had some very dangerous opportunities, and out of the dangerous opportunities that could have been goals, they were much more clearly in our favor in the first 15-20 minutes of the game.”
The Bears kept the pressure on the Crimson with a flurry of shots in the first half—Brown had 11 shots to Harvard’s three. The second half was even more ineffective, as the Crimson attack only got off one shot while the Bears had 10 times as many.
Before the half ended, Harvard took one of its five corner kicks for the game that freshman midfielder Obiajulu Agha almost converted, but his header sailed away from the goal.
On the game, Brown had seven corner kicks, keeping the Harvard back line alert at all times.
The second half started slowly for both teams, with the first shot on goal coming 15 minutes into the period. Once again it was Rosa who threatened the Crimson goal, but Harms was there, ready to keep the ball from entering the net.
At the 69:23 mark, another shot on goal forced Harms to make a save, and six minutes later, the junior easily collected another ball.
This time around, Harms was instrumental in creating Harvard’s lone on-target shot of the game, as the ball he sent up the field found the foot of junior Jamie Rees, who shot the ball at Grandstand. Grandstand had very little trouble stopping the shot with 15 minutes left to play.
After 90 minutes of play and no goals, the game went into two overtime periods that were held scoreless. It was actually the Crimson that came out this time with the intention of finishing off the game, creating two opportunities that scared the Bears.
Two defenders were important in the cause. At 93:38, junior Tim Linden had a shot that flew over the crossbar and six minutes later, sophomore Richard Smith had a header off a corner taken by sophomore Scott Prozeller that missed wide.
Brown put an end to its lapse in the second overtime period, dominating Harvard with four shots, the last of which was saved by Harms with two minutes remaining.
“We played well defensively, and Brown is a tough place to play,” said sophomore Brian Rogers in his first game back from injury. “We would like to get a win at some point. We need to start getting wins if we want to win the Ivy League, but this doesn’t kill us.”

On a pink-accented Jordan Field, Harvard field hockey suffered a tough loss to Cornell on Saturday, falling to the Big Red, 2-0.
For National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the crimson that normally dominates uniforms and apparel in the stands was overshadowed by pink hair dye, pink tape on sticks, and pink hats and scarves to fight the excessively windy weather. Halftime involved breast cancer trivia, a raffle, and breast cancer awareness bracelets.
The game was unusual not only because of the change in color scheme, but also because it represented a landmark victory for the Big Red (9-3, 3-1 Ivy). The win was Cornell’s second-ever victory at Jordan field, and its fourth victory in a row—the most consecutive victories in Big Red field hockey history.
Cornell began the game aggressively, taking the first shot in the fourth minute of the game. This shot set the pace for the rest of the first half, and the ball remained on the Crimson’s (3-10, 1-3) side of the field for the majority of the half.
Cornell had the advantage in penalty corners over the first 35 minutes, taking three to Harvard’s zero. The Big Red also outshot the Crimson, 5-1. Throughout the game, sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos made eight saves but allowed a 15th-minute unassisted goal to Catie De Stio. De Stio also added the game-clincher with two minutes left in the contest, finishing with both of Cornell’s scores on the day.
De Stio accounted for over half of the Big Red’s shots on goal as well. Of her nine shots, eight were on target, matching Harvard’s shot total for the entire contest. Three of the Crimson’s shots were on goal.
But even with these offensive discrepancies, the Crimson came out with a stronger attack in the second half. Harvard better controlled possession and was able to create some offensive opportunities. The squad took seven of its eight shots in the second frame, challenging Cornell a bit more.
“[Crimson coach Sue Caples] kind of just got our spirits back in it and told us that we do need to attack more and start pressuring Cornell and to work on our core skills,” said Tassopoulos of the coach’s words at halftime. “I think that’s something that we ended up improving on a lot in the second half.”
Harvard gained the advantage in penalty corners in the second half with six to the Big Red’s four. Of these six corners, four came in the last five minutes of the game when Harvard had a chance to force overtime.
“When you’re down by one goal and you get opportunities like that, it’s a very good sign. It shows that your attack is going in the right direction,” Tassopoulos said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t convert them today. But having four corners like that is very optimistic.”
On one penalty corner, the Cornell goalie fell to the ground—leaving Harvard a chance at a shot on the open net—but the team was unable to convert on the chance.
“In practice, we’ve been having really good corner success,” junior co-captain Carly Dickson said. “We were really disappointed that we didn’t finish any of them. They played a different defense than we had expected, so we needed to adjust.”
The Crimson’s opportunities on penalty corners were promptly followed by the Big Red’s second and final goal. De Stio carried the ball on a breakaway and scored off of a hard and well-placed shot. This goal cemented Cornell’s lead and led the visitors to victory.
“We still have three big games left, so we’re definitely not by any means giving up,” Dickson said. “It’s just that we really wanted to show that we can be really competitive in the Ivy League, so it’s just giving us a little bit more pressure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team entered the 2010 season with the goal of becoming just the second squad in program history to win three straight Ivy League championships.
That goal will likely go unrealized after the Crimson (5-5-1, 2-2 Ivy) dropped a 2-1 decision to Brown (7-4-3, 1-2-1) at Stevenson Field Saturday afternoon, picking up its second conference loss of the season.
The Bears, meanwhile, earned their first conference win of the year, relying on a late strike from freshman Louisa Pitney to take the 2-1 advantage—its first lead of the game—in the 84th minute.
“It was disappointing,” sophomore goalie AJ Millet said. “We came out strong but then kind of lost it. I feel like they kind of outplayed us.”
Harvard came up with two scoring opportunities late in the contest, but Brown managed to preserve its lead for the final six minutes of play, sending the Crimson home empty handed.
Harvard senior midfielder Kerry Kartsonis had the first of the Crimson’s final two chances, taking a shot in the 85th minute that was deflected by Bear goalkeeper M.C. Barrett. Co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh followed with a try of her own less than 30 seconds later, but her attempt was blocked.
“We kept fighting,” said Millet, who finished with four saves in her first game back since she suffered an injury four games into the season. “We definitely had some chances.”
But Harvard was unable to capitalize on those chances, resulting in its first loss since late September.
The way the game began, though, few could have predicted that the Crimson would finish on the losing end of the contest.
The visitors set the tone in the early going, taking the game’s first three shot attempts and eventually netting the first score.
Brown withstood Harvard’s initial attacks, as Bear starting keeper Amber Bledsoe rejected shots from Sheeleigh and sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro in the first 17 minutes of play.
But in the 28th minute, Conigliaro and Sheeleigh teamed up to get one past Bledsoe, connecting on a deep cross. Sheeleigh sent the pass to the far post, and Conigliaro finished with a one-time volley into the corner of the net, giving the Crimson the 1-0 lead.
“[Sheeleigh] just had this beautiful cross to the back post and [Conigliaro] was right there to finish it,” sophomore Taryn Kurcz said.
But momentum soon shifted to the home team after Brown answered with a score of its own just over 10 minutes later.
Brown Sophomore Diana Ohrt evened the score at 1-1 after she received a pass from Pitney off a corner kick and deflected the ball past Millet
“We didn’t mark up,” Kurcz said. “We just lost our marks.”
The Crimson hustled to regain the lead before the break but was whistled for going offside in the 39th minute and then had a shot blocked in the 45th minute.
The teams traded shot attempts throughout the second half, but Millet and Barrett—who replaced Bledsoe in goal for the Bears—kept their opponents off the scoreboard, making three saves apiece before the 80th minute.
Brown finally broke the deadlock in the 84th when Pitney headed a high cross into the cage past Millet.
The Bears managed to halt Harvard’s final attempts to send the game to overtime, preserving the 2-1 victory.
“We started off really well—fired up and ready to play,” Kurcz said. “Our problem this game was that we didn’t keep that intensity for the whole game, and Brown did. You can’t let down for one second or the other team’s going to capitalize on it.”
With the defeat, the Crimson drops to fourth place in the conference standings, trailing first-place Columbia by two games in the loss column with only three Ivy League games left to play.
“The biggest problem now is that we’re not in control of our own destiny,” Kurcz said. “What we have to do now is win out and hope for the best. It’s always a tough spot to have to rely on other people, but that’s we got ourselves into, and we’re going to make the most of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night in their game against Princeton, the ladies of Harvard women’s volleyball certainly learned how to put it all on the line.
The Crimson (5-13, 2-4 Ivy) fell to the Tigers (10-6, 5-0) in overtime of the fifth set Friday night, pushing through multiple injuries to its starting lineup only to be swept in three games against Penn (8-9, 4-1) the following afternoon.
“This weekend is kind of a mixed bag for our team,” co-captain Miyoko Pettit said. “Against Princeton...we played possibly the best volleyball we’ve played this season. It was a heartbreaking loss, but we could see how much potential we had. And then in our match against Penn, we just didn’t show up in the same way.”
PENN 3, HARVARD 0
Coming off a close loss to the Ivy League leaders in New Jersey, Harvard predicted its Saturday night matchup against the Quakers in Philadelphia to be more within reach. But they were soon proven wrong after the Crimson dropped three straight sets to Penn, 25-9, 25-12, 25-20.
“They had a really quick offense,” senior Mikaelle Comrie said. “We couldn’t get a good block up, and because of it, our passing system really broke down. We didn’t really have the opportunity to run a lot of plays.”
Harvard managed to tie it at 1-1 in the first set, but it was the closest the Crimson got to a lead, as Penn did not trail the entire night.
The Quakers decided the fate of the first two sets early on, powering to a 9-2 advantage in the opening game and then an errorless 13-0 lead in the second.
The closing stanza proved to be the tightest matchup, despite Penn’s 11-3 lead to start.
According to Pettit, Harvard went into the third set with the attitude that it had been lacking, but it was too little, too late. The Crimson fell to the Quakers, 25-20, the tightest finish of the series.
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 2
Harvard’s two-game Ivy League winning streak, encompassing victories over Cornell and Columbia, was brought to an end on Friday after a close match against Princeton was decided in the final two points of the fifth set.
“Our system was in place and our passing and defense were really good,” Pettit said. “Our middles had amazing games, so many blocks, which was huge. Everyone was playing really well compared to [Saturday].”
The Crimson came out with the lead in the first three sets, pulling ahead, 2-1. Both teams tied the first set at 19 and then again at 24, but the final two points went to Harvard, along with the set.
In the second stanza, the Tigers began with the lead and maintained it throughout, easily capturing the win, 25-16. It appeared, at the beginning the third, that Princeton would pull off a similar victory. But after the Tigers extended their lead to 19-13, the Crimson rallied for the win, tying up the set at 22 and 24 points.
Once again, Harvard pulled out a victory in the final two points of the set with help from one of junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll’s 16 kills and a second one by sophomore Taylor Docter to capture the set.
The fourth set followed a similar pattern to the second, in which the Tigers captured the lead early and maintained it throughout. Princeton took the game, 25-21.
The deciding game was point-for-point to start until the Tigers took a 14-11 lead. With service from junior Sandra Lynne Fryhofer, the Crimson successfully knotted up the score at 14.
Despite its underdog performance, Harvard gave away the final two points on an error and a kill, culminating in its first overtime loss of the weekend.
Although its record for the weekend may have been disappointing for the Crimson, Comrie views it as a possible opportunity to improve.
“We’re really going to have to come together as a team this week,” Comrie said. “We’re going have to work more on executing each part of our game together.”
“[This weekend] was a good thing moving into the season because it’s really going to require us to work on each aspect of the game in this next week of preparation,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The final tournament of the fall provided a bittersweet end to an up-and-down season for the Harvard women’s golf team, which placed second in the Harvard Invitational this weekend.
Following the first round of play Saturday, the host Crimson held a slim lead over the rest of the field—composed of the seven Ivy competitors—but rival Yale overcame a three-stroke deficit during yesterday’s final round to take home the tournament’s top prize.
“We still feel pretty good about what we did this weekend,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It was probably the best we played for a complete tournament this fall and in pretty tough conditions.”
Freshman Bonnie Hu once again led the way for the Crimson, contributing a two-day score of 148 (+4), good for second place overall.
“My ball-striking was decent, and my putting was pretty good,” Hu said. “I didn’t really make too many mistakes.”
Captain Mia Kabasakalis, who turned in a 154, was the team’s next-best finisher.
“I definitely played a little bit better this week, especially the first day—given the conditions,” Kabasakalis said.
Rookie Fritzi Reuter (156), sophomore Katie Sylvan (158), and junior Christine Cho (160) rounded out the scoring for Harvard.
The squad battled through rough conditions on the first day to grab the tournament lead with a 303.
“[Saturday] it was really, really, really super windy, and it was really hard, because the wind kept changing directions,” Hu said. “It was hard to choose which club to hit, because one minute the wind would be in your face, and the other minute it would be downwind...you’re standing there and you don’t feel stable at all, even when you’re putting.”
But the squad could not sustain its momentum through the final day, shooting five strokes worse and opening the door for Yale to capture its third victory of the fall.
“We just sort of struggled [yesterday], but it’s just one of our little dips,” Hu said.
Led by standout freshman See Heo Moon, the Bulldogs shot a team score of 303 in their second look at the par-72 International Golf Course in Bolton, Mass., giving them a total of 609—two strokes better than the Crimson’s final total.
Already the individual leader after turning in a two-over 74 Saturday, Moon bettered it with a scorching career-low 66—a round that included her first-ever hole-in-one.
“Today she just played really amazing,” said Hu, who has known Moon since junior golf. “She didn’t make any mistakes. She pretty much hit every single fairway, every single green, and made a lot of putts. It was fun watching her, because she played really well.”
Penn came in a distant third at 625, 14 strokes behind the hosts.
While it appears that Harvard and Yale are currently neck-and-neck—the Crimson bested its archrival by just one stroke at the Nittany Lion Invitational two weeks ago—the tournament gave a glimpse of how the league leaders compare to the rest of the Ancient Eight.
“From what it’s looking like, Yale is about as strong as anyone; we’re about as strong as anyone,” Rhoads said. “Yale and us may be bunched kind of close together, and Princeton, Penn are not very far behind.”
Harvard now heads into the winter offseason having collected zero wins this season—a clear departure from last fall’s two first-place and one runner-up finishes.
“Last year we were where we wanted to be throughout the fall,” Rhoads said. “This year we know that we’re not where we want to be.”
Despite the stinging second-place finish, the squad emphasized the strides it has made during the fall season after coming out of the gate slowly last month.
“We were definitely disappointed [with the weekend],” Hu said, “but I think so far this whole season we’ve been steadily improving, so I feel good going into the spring season.”
It is clear, though, that the Crimson has its work cut out for it before it resumes competitive play in March.
“We need to work very hard in the offseason, probably harder than we’ve ever worked in the offseason, if we want to be at the top of the league by the end of the year,” Rhoads said.

In case you didn't get a chance to read The Crimson this morning, one study co-authored by a Harvard professor showed that mice engineered with a certain protein have a peculiar power: the ability to "smell" light.
By using a specific kind of protein, researchers created mice whose olfactory bulbs—the part of the brain involved in sensing odors—had neurons that responded when scientists shone light on them.
To read more about this pretty cool development, check out the article about it in today's Crimson.

Piggybacking on the coincidence that a footwear company’s acronym is also the first two letters of its name, Pforzheimer House is organizing a group order of PF Flyers, which it's billing as the "the official Pfoho shoe."
The shoes, which are half-off for Pfoho residents, are essentially regular high-top Converses—except, instead of the Converse star, there’s a label that says, “PF Flyers.”
The shoe, which is available in black and red, even has a nice green “PF” label on the lower back of the shoe.
Popular through the 1960s and 1970s and previously owned by Converse and New Balance, PF Flyers were featured in the movie “The Sandlot," when Benny puts on the shoe to “run faster and jump higher” to avoid a neighborhood dog that has his Babe Ruth-autographed baseball.
So will the PF Flyers help Pfoho residents run more quickly from the Quad to that class in Sever? Only time will tell.

Eight students in Human Evolutionary Biology 1418: “Endocrinology and Behavior” are practically drooling over the possibility of you giving them your saliva.
Over the next two weeks, HEB 1418 aims to explore the relationships between hormones and the prevalence of certain traits in men and women, according to Susan F. Lipson ’75, an HEB lecturer. Results of the study go towards the students’ individual research projects, which could make headway in identifying factors associated with disease prevalence.
But to get that data, the researchers need you. More specifically, they want you to drool in front of a mirror, filling up two tubes with your precious saliva. From there, your finger size will be evaluated in addition to your shoulder span and hip and waist measurements.
It’s a painless process and comes with free gum and treats. Their doors are open between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays on the fifth floor of the Peabody Museum, so if you’re interested in donating your slobber for science, the researchers would be more than happy if you dropped by.
