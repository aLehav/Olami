After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How did a Republican from Poughkeepsie by the name of Stephen M. Saland become one of the greatest forces for gay rights this side of Lady Gaga?
In late June, when a bill to legalize gay marriage was floundering in the New York state Senate, Saland stepped up to make a majority, asserting that everyone deserves equal treatment under the law—marriage included. Incidentally I was visiting friends in town and saw, after the Senate passed the bill, New York streets overflowed with jubilatory crowds during what was perhaps not coincidentally the weekend of the city’s Gay Pride Parade.
Gay marriage is the newest front in the civil rights movement that has passed through Seneca Falls and Selma, Alabama. Denying two committed people to the social benefits of marriage is inherently unfair and oppressive. Though I fail to see how opposing gay marriage is an ethically defensible position, I can understand where the social conservative contingent is coming from. Marriage as an institution derives from religious sacrament, and, in the Judeo-Christian tradition, marriage is a procreative and holy rite between a man and a woman. But why is something as intimate and personal as marriage the purview of government at all?
If you don’t agree with a religion, you don’t have to pay attention to it. The same does not go for your country’s government and laws. Because it can’t be avoided, government must provide equal protection under the law to its citizens. It also has a responsibility to avoid meddling in religion. Instead of making the issue the latest skirmish in the so-called culture wars, we should circumvent the entire issue by dissolving the very concept of government-recognized marriage.
The concept of marriage as a legally binding contract is antiquated and causes much suffering. If two people, regardless of gender, decide to commit themselves to one another, they should be free to do so. However, they should be just as free to dissolve the bond if they decide the partnership can no longer work. Legally dissolving a marriage is monumentally traumatic, costly, and time-consuming. And yet one of every two married couples must endure it.
Government-protected marriage comes from an era when women were socially and economically subjugated to men. The contract served to protect women from abandonment, philandering and the like. Today this is less of a factor. Yes, a woman who commits to marriage and child-rearing oftentimes sacrifices some independent livelihood and career development, though that’s no longer a steadfast rule. Responsible adults should be expected to act as such without painful governmental restrictions that can force people to choose between going through the hell of a divorce and the hell of being legally bound to someone who you can no longer endure.
Don’t interpret my position as being “anti-love.” In fact, I believe love and love alone should be enough to make two people want to share everything—time, money, life—with one another. Government is an inherently unsexy entity, and should stay outside the domestic castle whenever possible.
The only time in which government should step in to enforce a contract is to protect an innocent third-party: a child. When a couple decides to conceive and raise a kid, they should be required to sign a legally-binding and enforceable contract with each other to rear the child, valid until the offspring turns 18. A child is harmed deeply if one parent decides to bail. The parent who makes career sacrifices to make a home also deserves protection. As the government avoids regulating business unless there is an externality involved—air quality, endangered species—so should it only intervene in a social situation fraught if an innocent is endangered.
After the kid grows up and leaves, why do the parents have to stay together? They’ve probably established a good relationship built on years of shared experiences, but the decision should revert to the two of them instead of being underwritten by the government.
All other benefits of legal marriage can be preserved by making civil unions, the secular half-measure currently offered to gays in lieu of full marriage, the norm. If you want to file taxes jointly, do so; government shouldn’t be subsidizing heterosexuality anyway. Medical decisions on behalf of your partner? Power of attorney is a serious declaration and should be separate from the amorous aspects of marriage. Shared benefits and health insurance can be based off of civil unions, joint marriages, or other measures of commitment.
The entire gay marriage debate reminds us of why the separation of church and state thing is so important. The state can treat everyone equally, and religions can discriminate against whoever they’d like. Let the New York legislature worry about more important issues, like whether it can get Lady Gaga to fill the budget gap.

The woes of the U.S. Postal Service are in the news again, with the organization headed for default once more. The New York Times has urged modernizing reforms, while the Direct Marketing Association called for outright privatization. Both of these proposals are misguided. They ignore the fundamental reasons to have a post office at all, and thus reach erroneous conclusions about how to best break the cycle of default scares and steer the USPS into the future. We should follow the example of nearly two hundred years of American history and re-nationalize the Post Office.
The Post Office makes no sense as an independent business. Instead it first and foremost serves as the internal communications infrastructure of the government. Next, it is a public service. Both of these goals directly contradict the suggestion that the Post Office can be independent of government.
Consider the government of the United States of America—easier said than done, for such a massive operation. Faithful, exact copies of laws passed in Congress must be available to any federal or state official, anywhere, for the law cannot be enforced if it is not known. Taxes must be collected from every citizen and business in the nation; funds must be disbursed widely and securely. Summonses and legal orders must arrive promptly at their destination. In general, all parts of the government must be in prompt, constant communication with each other, as well as with the citizenry, or we do not have much of a state at all.
It is easy to ignore this vast machinery of communication, largely because in our modern age it works so well. Few people, upon receiving, say, summons for an audit, will pause to marvel at how promptly it arrived. Nevertheless, such machinery is vital to the functioning of the government, and it is provided by the Post Office. Making the Post Office external or independent is generally unwise. It renders core government functions beholden to the health and interests of an independent body.
In order to meet this primary need for governmental communications, the Post Office requires a substantial infrastructure—“Post Offices and Post Roads,” in the words of the Constitution—across the entire nation. Mail sent every day requires a delivery every day. At this point, the infrastructure has vast, unused capacity. Every single citizen needs to be attached to the great postal network, but an ordinary person may only correspond with the government once or twice a year. Thus, it makes sense to employ this excess capacity to turn the Post Office not merely into a government function, but also a public service.
As a public service, the Post Office does charge the citizenry, much like mass transit systems. However, the Post Office’s goal is not to make a profit. Rather, the introduction of some nominal cost of carriage simply serves to discourage frivolous use while defraying cost; it is not meant to generate revenue. Instead, the cost of the Post Office should be met by taxation, the general fund of society. In this, the Post Office is like any other branch of the government. Police forces may make money with traffic tickets, but they do not rely on such revenues. To do so would create terribly perverse incentives.
So, as both as an internal government operation, and as a public service, the Post Office is properly an agency of government. And the history of the U.S. confirms this insight. From when Ben Franklin was appointed Postmaster General by the Continental Congress until 1982, the USPS was an arm of the U.S. government. It was only recently that we entered the current bizarre semi-private structure, where the USPS operates as an unfunded monopoly on first class mail.
Not only is nationalization in accord with the proper role of the Post Office and its history, it would also immediately resolve the so-called deficit of the USPS. A government agency, of course, cannot have an independent deficit. The military does not have a “deficit” because it costs more than it extracts in tribute. NASA does not have a “deficit” because it failed to discover gold on the moon. The Post Office, when properly constituted as a government agency, does not have a deficit. It adds to the federal expense, yes, but when considered as part of that whole, its costs are small indeed.
Furthermore, nationalization could remove the anti-competitive tendencies underlying the Post Office’s current monopoly on first class mail. As a government service, the USPS would need no monopoly to protect its revenues. With nationalization, we can remove unnecessary restrictions on first class mail and let private companies compete as well.
Some critics will maintain that putting the Post Office back on the taxpayer dime will allow us to delay and undermine the fundamental reforms necessary to bring the institution into the 21st Century. But this is the same misguided argument that gave us the debt ceiling crisis—that an artificial crisis, sparked by misguided bean-counting, should compel us to make haphazard, self-destructive cuts rather than the gradual and thoughtful reforms that are actually needed.
Others will argue that the Post Office is ultimately an anachronism in the days of digital communication. But it is only an anachronism if we let it become one. The Post Office should expand its offerings to include some form of digital communication, so that government offices may communicate literally at light speed without filling the coffers of telecom providers, so that American citizens are not beholden to the prices of oligopolistic companies when they wish to connect with one another. But it can do so as a government body.
When we consider the Post Office’s reason for existing, the way forward is clear. We must give up on the short-sighted semi-private model of the past decades, and return the USPS to its proper position as a part of the United States government.

This school year saw the addition of a new class to the course catalog: Freshman Seminar 27e: “Big Ideas.” Headed by Professors Douglas A. Melton and Nicholas A. Christakis, the course is offered concurrently at Harvard, Yale, and Bard College. Taught through a combination of video lectures, essays, readings, and class discussions, “Big Ideas” takes a nontraditional approach, with the lectures conducted by academics exploring a range of specialized topics.
From statistics to the classics, the course is meant to introduce students to a spectrum of academic fields and prompt them to see connections between varying disciplines in an engaging fashion. The enrolled freshmen are exposed to many topics, introducing them to potential future fields of study which they may not have before had the opportunity to consider and explore. This seminar is a good way to make a diversity of information available to students in a palatable way. It is an interesting experiment and we applaud the initiative of these professors in starting it.
Freshman seminars are a great setting for pedagogical experimentation, making this format an ideal setting for the exploration aspects of both teaching and learning found in “Big Ideas.” The combination of utilizing technology through video lectures and engaging in more conventional avenues like readings and discussion sections sets the course’s teaching style apart. The same is true for the tactic of drawing from a selection of lecturers from the Harvard community and beyond, making “Big Ideas” distinct from the typical Harvard course taught solely by only one or two lecturers.
How students are learning is also unique in this seminar. Rather than focusing on a single overarching topic, the course’s main function is to introduce students to a wide variety of subjects from across academic disciplines within the context of a single course. Students also have the benefit of learning about topics from lecturers who know the subjects particularly well, like Professor Steven A. Pinker on linguistics and brain function. While this structure has its benefits, the “Big Ideas” model should be limited to freshman seminars, as it doesn’t allow students to go into any material in an in-depth manner. The course is best geared toward first-year students still in the process of determining a course of study.
Most importantly, however, we appreciate that the College is experimenting with new ways of teaching material in a time when students are bombarded with information in innumerable ways.

Hundreds of Somalis are dying everyday. 750,000 will die over the next few months if the international community does not take dramatic action to help ease the suffering due to the East African famine. Thirteen million people throughout East Africa are in need of emergency help, and four million are living through the worst famine in 20 years.
More people are at risk of death than in the combination of the Japanese Earthquake, the Libyan Civil War, and catastrophic American weather events of 2011, but the international community has not done nearly enough to help. East Africa is experiencing a famine of epic proportions, and the global community can do much more.
The crisis is a long time in the making, and has been spurred on by a variety of environmental and political factors. It was induced by a drought that is the worst in 60 years and has been exacerbated by the political situation in Somalia, perhaps the world’s most dysfunctional failed state. The nominally democratic government in the north of the country is extremely weak, and though it lets in foreign aid it also loots and steals the food aid. The extremist al-Shabab government in the south refuses to let foreign aid into its regions, leaving its residents with few options other than to flee to overloaded refugee camps in Kenya.
The failed state exists in a large part because of a lack of attention from the international community. For years, foreigners have been more interested in the East Africans’ tenuous relationship with terrorists than the geopolitical and human consequences of a failed state in the region. Thus, we have spent a sizable sum on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations in Somalia while failing to invest in creating sustainable institutions in the region. As Nicholas D. Kristof recently wrote, it is no coincidence that the famine is hitting Somalia, a country with no functioning institutions, much harder than it is hitting countries like Kenya and Ethiopia, where sophisticated famine warning systems and strong agricultural institutions have cushioned them against the worst of the famine.
We can learn a useful long-term lesson from this famine about the necessity of working with the global community to help build functional states in chaos-torn areas, but right now there is little time to dwell on long-term foreign policy goals. Every day hundreds of Somalis are dying, and this issue must become an urgent, front-page priority for wealthy governments and societies throughout the world.
According to USAID, more people are at risk than the combined populations of New York City and Los   Angeles. In Somalia, one child dies every six minutes. The U.N. has estimated that $2.5 billion is needed in aid to fight the immediate crisis; until now the international community has donated $1.7 billion, with $600 billion coming from the United States.
The aid needs become more dire every day, but even ordinary students can help in meaningful ways. Donating $10 to the consortium of charities linked at usaid.gov/fwd can feed a family of six for two days. Writing your Congressmen and Senators and urging businesses to give is also vitally important; $800 million is a large gap to fill for individuals, but it is a drop in the bucket of cumulative corporate profits and the annual federal budget and would be a small investment to save an enormous number of lives.
Given the fact that the Al-Shabab are not even allowing foreign aid workers into south Somalia, some might see donating further to efforts as futile. However, much of the care goes to fleeing Somalis in Kenyan refugee camps, as well as to families fleeing into Mogadishu, and is undertaken by foreign aid groups.
It might also seem that $600 million is more than enough aid from the U.S., and other countries should step up to do their part. It is true that new powers such as China have done a pitiful job of stepping in to help, but with the famine in an urgent crisis, it is not enough to point fingers when aid is literally needed at this moment. As a country, we have both the compassion and the power to make an even greater difference in this famine, and regardless of whether others do, we should.
The world is facing its most urgent humanitarian crisis in decades, and there is a great amount to do to help out. Donate to feed a family right now; tell all your friends about the issue, and encourage politicians to appropriate more funds to USAID’s efforts. Whether in the Japanese Earthquake, the earthquake in Haiti, or the tsunami in Indonesia, the American people and their government have been leaders in foreign disaster response. In a crisis where hundreds of children and their families are starving everyday, there is an urgent need for Americans to much more aggressively lead the response.

New York University History Professor Ada Ferrer spoke Tuesday on the significance of the Haitian Revolution, both on its impact on the independence movements in the region and on Haiti’s policy that all black, former slaves were free upon setting foot on Haitian soil.
Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Chair of the Department of African and African American Studies, introduced the talk and noted that students in the United States are rarely taught about Haiti’s influence on the independence movements in Latin and North America.
Ferrer cited the little known story of several Jamaican slaves who managed to escape from slavery to Haiti. When their previous owner came to Haiti in January of 1817 intending to reclaim his slaves, Haitian President Alexandre Pétion refused him and defended the freedom of the black men using the newly created Haitian Constitution which declared Haiti legally free soil. Haiti was the first country that provided a safe haven for all former slaves, she said.
To African and African American Studies Professor Doris Sommer, the tale of the escaped slaves is often overlooked, but is highly significant in the study of Haiti as a precursor to other Latin American independence movements and anti-slavery laws.
“The Haitian Constitution took free land as the space for encouraging slave peoples to become free peoples,” said Sommer, also a Romance Languages and Literatures professor.
Ferrer’s talk was the second in a five-part series called “Interrogating the Afro-Latin American Experience,” a series which Higginbotham said is intended to address the way current scholars learn about the African and Latin tradition in the Americas.
Many audience members—including graduate students, undergraduates, and visiting professors—said that the most striking aspect of the event was Ferrer’s redefinition of citizenship in early Haiti.
“I wasn’t aware that all Haitian citizens were considered black,” Elliot A. Wilson ’15 said of an idea that Ferrer discussed. “That changes our conception of race.”
Wilson added that race can no longer be considered as solely biological, an idea seconded by Fernando Gomez-Herrero, visiting scholar in Romance Languages and Literatures.
Gomez-Herrero also raised the question of whether Haiti intended total black liberty to expand beyond its borders.
Ferrer answered that Haiti engaged and addressed the world via its monumental anti-slavery laws, which would later influence other independence movements.
The content of Ferrer’s talk will be published in The American Historical Review in 2012 and in her upcoming book on the impact of the Haitian Revolution on Cuba and the Atlantic World.

Three Harvard professors are among the 22 scholars selected to received a MacArthur Fellowship “genius grant,” the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation announced Tuesday.
The foundation awarded the five-year grants worth half a million dollars to Harvard Professors Markus Greiner, associate professor of physics, Roland G. Fryer Jr., professor of economics, and Matthew K. Nock, professor of psychology, as well as 19 other scholars, writers, musicians, and thinkers.
Greiner’s work on the spatial organization of ultra-cold atoms and its applications, Fryer’s investigation of the causes and consequences of racial disparities in the United States, and Nock’s study of self-injury and suicidal behavior all caught the attention of the committee.
Greiner recalled his excitement upon receiving the call that he won the award, but added that he was sworn to secrecy until the Foundation made an official announcement.
“It was a great surprise,” Greiner said. “It’s a great honor.”
Fryer described his reaction to receiving the news as “shocked” and “grateful.”
“You get a call out of the blue and someone says, ‘Are you alone?’” Fryer said. “I’m still in a little bit of shock.”
The Foundation’s selection committee, whose members’ identities are entirely confidential, chooses “individuals who show exceptional creativity in their work and the prospect for still more in the future,” according to the group’s website.
The MacArthur Fellowship is “designed to provide seed money for intellectual, social, and artistic endeavors.” In the spirit of intellectual and artistic freedom, the grant, which is distributed in quarterly installments over five years, carries a “no strings attached policy.” That means recipients are not asked to report how they spend the money and are free to spend the money how they choose.
Although he is still deciding exactly how he will put the grant to use, Greiner is thinking about installing an exploration lab that would give physics students the chance to try out new things and retain what he described as their “play spirit.”
“That’s how innovation in the long run comes along,” Greiner said.
Fryer said he hasn’t had time to give spending the money much consideration, but says he’ll likely use it to better understand the racial achievement gap in American schools.
Harvard-affiliated names appear frequently among the 850 Fellows that the MacArthur Foundation has named since it began giving out the grant in 1981. Most recently, one year ago, Annette Gordon-Reed, professor of law and history, received the Fellowship.

Dissident Chinese poet Liao Yiwu spoke about his escape this year from Chinese persecution and performed on Chinese flute Tuesday afternoon at a lecture hosted by Harvard’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.
At the event, entitled “A Poet in Exile: A Dialogue with Liao Yiwu,” Liao recited his poem “Massacre,” the work for which he was imprisoned and tortured for over four years.
“I think it was really courageous of him to perform a chant that brings out haunting emotions for him—it was the piece that put him in jail,” said attendee Heejoon Choi ’15.
Liao’s reading of the piece, entitled “Massacre” and performed in howls and ritualistic Chinese chants, was notable given the contentious history of the poem. Communist authorities had detained Liao in China largely because he refused their demands that he not recite “Massacre” abroad, as the poem was inspired by the brutal government crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989. After applying for more than 15 exit visas, the former political prisoner finally left China, fleeing through Vietnam and eventually reaching Germany in July of this year.
“[Liao] was actually taken by the police in the middle of our phone conversation,” said moderator Rowena X. He of the department of East Asian Studies, describing communications with the poet earlier this year that culminated in yesterday’s dialogue. “He was told that there was no way he would be able to speak at Harvard.”
Liao made his precipitous escape to the West within the last few months and began a tour promoting his book “God is Red,” which tells the stories of persecuted Chinese Christians.
Even as Liao discussed Chinese repression, Tuesday’s dialogue was also punctuated by laughter, as the audience applauded his jokes at the expense of the Chinese government.
“I think I would rather be ruled by a pig than a Chinese leader like Mao [Zedong] or Deng [Xiaoping],” Liao said. “At least a pig makes a sound when it’s eating.”
The event itself focused on the work of Liao since 1989. A prominent state-sponsored poet in the 1980s, Liao fell from grace after an audio recording of “Massacre” came to light. He was arrested, along with his pregnant wife, and imprisoned for four years. Twice he attempted suicide.
But he survived and began to memorize the stories of his fellow prisoners.
“My head would be exploding from their stories, so I turned my head into a tape recorder,” Liao said. He added that these narratives became the foundation for his recent books, now banned in China, that recount the stories of everyday people.
“I’m not a writer, not a murderer,” he said. “I’m just a tape recorder of my era.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1974, Boston Public Schools were ordered by the US District Court to racially integrate the schools that had majority of white students, leading to a mass resistance movement and public violence.
Tuesday evening, the Graduate School of Education’s Askwith Forum featured a new documentary, “Can We Talk? Learning from Boston’s Busing Desegregation Crisis” that catalogs the individual experiences of former Boston students, including some who were physically assaulted by protesters throwing rocks.
Donna Bivens, the coordinator of the Boston Busing/Desegregation Project, which produced the film, said that her purpose was to screen a portion of the documentary in order to receive feedback for the future, as well as “invite [viewers] into a process of having Boston look again at this era that was so critical and has shaped Boston into what it is today.”
The film featured individuals who were bused to South Boston High School, which was in a poor, predominantly white community that opposed the busing of blacks to its school and the busing of its own students to Roxbury High School in a predominantly black neighborhood.
During the first few weeks of school, hundreds of community members lined the streets of buses carrying black students throwing rocks at the children.
“They must have had buckets of rocks,” one woman said in the film. “You had to get low in the seats so you wouldn’t get hurt.”
Another was struck on her hand, and as she crouched down, a rock hit her friend in the eye.
The panelists and audience agreed that though these events happened decades ago, the residual trauma and racism still linger.
“Feelings don’t go away, reality doesn’t go away,” Ed School professor John Diamond said. “The reputation of the city is tied to this moment historically.”
Diamond, who was in kindergarten in 1974, still remembers the racial slurs that were thrown at him when he was bused to school in another neighborhood.
Audience member John E. Barbour, Jr., a longtime resident of Roxbury, said that while the individual testimonies were powerful, he would have appreciated more emphasis on the institutional problems with Boston Public Schools.
“I could see in the urban schools where my friends and family went, that [Boston Public Schools] weren’t even able to attract teachers that were good at educating,” he said, stressing that the school system should focus on universal quality education rather than on racial integration.
Though Barbour said his family had a long history of advocating for civil rights—he attended the March on Washington as a child—he said that he and his siblings were sent to suburban private schools.
Several audience members said they would have liked to hear the thoughts of those who were in the streets in September of 1974, a side of the story not portrayed in the film.
“Why were they seeing blacks as the problem?” Diamond asked.

UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union which represents Harvard dining hall workers, canceled their scheduled vote on the new, tentatively agreed upon contract with Harvard on Monday, and instead had an informational meeting for its members.
Union leaders said that the vote was cancelled because there was confusion among the members on a separate benefits issue regarding dining hall workers at Harvard Business School. The union says that those workers, who are employed by the private contractor Restaurant Associates, are not receiving appropriate benefits.
Local 26 President Brian Lang said that he canceled the vote because he was worried that the negative emotions surrounding the Business School employees’ situation would cause union members at HUHDS to vote down what the union and the University both feel is a very good contract.
“They’re separate issues” Lang said before the meeting with workers. “But we’re worried workers aren’t going to vote for the contract until the issue is resolved.”
According to Lang, the nine workers at the Business School were previously Harvard employees who, in 1983, were transferred to Restaurant Associates on the condition that they retain Harvard benefits. However, Lang said that while Harvard employees’ benefits have continued to improve, the benefit packages of the Restaurants Associates employees have lagged behind.
“I’ve worked for the University for 30 years and over that time the University has affected us by stripping our benefits.” said George Sabatino, one of the nine affected workers. “The only thing we’re asking is to be treated like every other Harvard [dining hall] employee.”
Sabatino also confirmed Lang’s original fear about voting on the contract.
“I’m choosing to vote down the contract until that issue is resolved,” Sabatino said.
Local 26 has taken an active step towards changing the working conditions for Sabatino and his peers. Yesterday, the union sent over 60 dining hall workers to the office of HBS Associate Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi.
“We alerted her to the issues,” Lang said. “She was very receptive.”
Crispi and the Business School could not be reached for comment. The University declined to comment.
Adams House Chief Steward Edward B. Childs, a member of the Local 26 bargaining committee, said that he does not think members will vote for the new contract as long as they don’t believe in Harvard as an employer, even after the clarification meeting.
“There’s mistrust of Harvard,” Childs said, “And I can’t give them the word that there’s anything to trust.”
However, Childs said that despite member unrest, he still supports the contract.
“I haven’t changed my mind on the contract,” he said. “But it’s not just about me, it’s about all the members.”
However, after the informational meeting, Lang said he was more confident about the vote.
“I think that our meeting yesterday went a long way to explaining to people what’s going on,” Lang said. “People are saying, ‘Well fine, let’s go forward with the vote on the contract but we’re not gonna stop fighting until the dining hall workers at the business school are taken’.”

Inside the Stuff Sale tent earlier this year, members of Harvard Habitat for Humanity used iPhones and iPods to accept payments for everything from fans to furniture. Instead of withdrawing money, students wishing to purchase items for their dorm room were able to use credit cards, and sellers no longer needed to keep track of wads of cash.
Responsible for this transition? An inch-wide device named Square, which—when plugged into the headphone jack of a smartphone—allows any individual or business to accept credit card payments via a free mobile application.
Square, whose board of directors includes Former University President Lawrence H. Summers, has quickly gained prominence in the Harvard community as it allows students, organizations and local businesses to accept credit cards more easily.
SPREADING ACROSS CAMPUS
From House Committees to student-run businesses, several groups on campus have latched onto Square to increase their sales.
Alisandrea A. Waldron ’13 serves as the Harvard campus representative for Square through the company’s SquareU program, which promotes use on college campuses. Waldron is one of 55 representatives at selected schools throughout the country.
Waldron has been promoting the device to students and organizations, including Habitat for Humanity and Harvard Student Agencies
As a SquareU rep, Waldron can provide interested users with the free product.
“It doesn’t cost anything to get a card reader, so if you need to take a payment and the person doesn’t have cash, Square enables you to do that,” Waldron said.
“I think all student organizations at Harvard could use Square to take payments for merchandise or dues. It is a great resource for students that can simplify the lives of financial directors in student organizations,” Waldron noted.
Indeed, the Mather HoCo is planning on using Square for House clothing orders this year. The product will coordinate all credit card sales to one bank account instead of having various members of the board collect cash.
“We had issues last year with our clothing orders, so we’re using Square to try to make it easier for the House,” said Mather House Committee Co-Chair Andrew F. Iannone ’12.
HSA used the product at Commencement last year during their tent sales, which sell logo apparel to the visiting throngs. HSA President Ethan A. Waxman ’12 said the tents had been a growing part of their business, but they found more of their customers wanted to use credit cards.
Before Square, HSA members would use carbon paper to record credit card information. The organization lost sales, however, since some credit cards would get declined.
Waxman said the HSA will not use the device in the Harvard Shop year-round due to the lack of an inventory management system that they have built into their current system.
“We’re not going to replace our systems, but it’s been fantastic for our tent sales. It’s hard to quantify [compared to previous years], but our tent sales have been easier and faster,” Waxman said.
COMPLETELY WIRELESS
Created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey in 2009, Square began as a start-up in Silicon Valley and has since spread across the country. Any individual can request a free device at squareup.com and download the free application on a iOS or Android device.
The device requires a cellular network or a wireless connection and can make a transaction in about three seconds, according to Katie R. Baynes, public relations manager at Square.
The company charges 2.75 percent of the transaction cost per credit card swipe. The same fee applies to all accepted credit cards.
After swiping the credit card, customers can sign on the screen and receive an email or text message receipt.
Square insures security by complying with Payment Card Industry standards and encrypting all of its data. The application does not store any information, and users must go through a short security check before opening an account.
But some still find the mechanism a bit disconcerting.
“It’s almost concerning how easy it is. You could take someone’s credit card and give yourself a lot of money,” said Waxman.
MOBILE BUSINESSES
Not all local businesses have had glowing experiences with Square.
Clover Food Lab, a vegetarian restaurant on Holyoke St., began using Square in October 2010 but has since switched to using it only as a back-up if their current system goes down.
Ayr M. Muir, owner and founder of Clover, noted that at the restaurant the system had tended to be slow and unreliable.
The benefit, Ayr said, is that the system does work with an iPhone, which they use to take orders onboard every food truck. As a result, if the primary system goes down inside the truck, they can still accept credit cards.
Even with the monthly fee, transaction fee and percentage transaction fee of Clover’s current system, Muir said it is cheaper than using the Square due to the number of transactions Clover does per day.
“It’s similar to a cell phone plan. Depending on your use, if you pay for a bigger plan, it costs you more. If you use Square, there’s no monthly plan cost but the per transaction fee is much higher,” Muir said.
Square can therefore be more compatible with small businesses who do not have many transactions per day.
Several tents at the Harvard Farmers Market now use Square to provide the convenience of cards to customers at their stands.
“People are convinced that you don’t need to carry cash anymore, but that doesn’t work in a farmers’ market,” Brian Quinn, co-owner of Q’s Nuts, said at his stall outside the Science Center Tuesday.
Quinn looked into purchasing a credit card system but did not want to make a long commitment or pay a monthly fee when his business is seasonal.
“All I had to do was get a smartphone,” Quinn said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As State Senator Steven Tolman seeks the presidency of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, local politicos have begun eyeing his seat.
State Representative William N. Brownsberger ’78 of Belmont, has already announced his intention to run.
Meanwhile, State Representative Jonathan Hecht of Watertown, says he is considering entering the race should Tolman step down.
Tolman, Hecht, and Brownsberger are all Democrats.
Brownsberger—who has represented Belmont in the House since 2006—said in an interview Tuesday that he expects other candidates to enter the race.
“Nobody is in it. Everybody’s thinking about it,” Brownsberger said.
But, Brownsberger said, even if other candidates join the race, he is ready to take on any challengers.
“I like Representative Hecht very much, but I think my record of public service is longer,” Brownsberger said.
For his part, Hecht has not officially thrown his hat in the race.
“Senator Tolman is still our senator and will be until he resigns,” Hecht said. But, he added, “I am looking very closely at the race. I am interested in running.”
Each candidate would bring different life experiences to the seat. Hecht, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988, first gained elected office in 2005 as a member of the Watertown Town Council. Before that he worked for a number of years researching East Asia and China. He co-founded the China Law Center at Yale Law School.
Brownsberger, a resident in Currier House during his time at the College, also graduated from the Law School in 1983.
“I’ve been involved in local politics for about 15 or 16 years,” Brownsberger said.
His resume includes coaching soccer and chairing the Belmont Democratic Town Committee.
Brownsberger considers himself a “social liberal, but fiscally responsible.”
He said his campaign will focus on the idea that every American should enjoy a good quality of life.
He said he hopes that one day “everybody has the opportunity to enter and remain in the middle class.”
He said he is passionate about representing his constituents and said he decided to run after “lots of people encouraged me to take an office where I can do more good. It’s a very natural step for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The return of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps to campus after nearly 40 years has some hopeful that—although many logistical kinks are still to be worked out—current cadets may soon have more peers in the program.
The recognition of the program and increased ease of participation could help motivate previously hesitant students to join, according to attendees at an event Tuesday commemorating the opening of an NROTC office in the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
Sgt. Taylor B. Evans ’14, who served in the Marine Corps for five years before enrolling at Harvard, said that some applicants might have been deterred by Harvard’s refusal to recognize ROTC.
Evans said he hopes that Harvard’s recognition of the program will allow applicants to say, “Harvard is for it, my parents are for it, I’m for it. I believe in this, I believe in the country, I want to serve. Let’s do it.”
Although NROTC is officially recognized and Harvard will now be contributing funding and administrative support, a unit will not be established on campus and Harvard cadets will continue to train at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Harvard has agreed to provide the office for the program, transportation to MIT, and use of Harvard athletic fields for training exercises.
According to the University’s agreement with the Navy, Harvard will contribute funding to the operation of the office and to the creation of a new NROTC director, who will provide mentoring and advice to cadets in the program.
Catherine A. Brown ’14, a current cadet, said she previously had to travel to Boston University or MIT for these counseling services, and in the past, cadets have had to find rides on their own or travel by public transportation.
Brown said that the University is still working out the logistics of transportation, but that the talks are “very encouraging so far.”
Capt. Paul E. Mawn ’63 USNR (Ret.), chairman of Advocates for Harvard ROTC, said that he hopes that eventually Harvard will be able to provide a full array of ROTC services on campus for both the Navy and other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, which do not currently have official relations with Harvard.
While Mawn said he is very pleased with the opening of the NROTC office, he added integrating ROTC into Harvard’s campus remains “a mission far from accomplished as far as Advocates for Harvard ROTC go.”
Brown added that, even though her decision to attend Harvard was not significantly impacted by the University’s previous lack of recognition, she was pleased with the steps that the University has taken.
“Even if the concrete details aren’t worked out, it’s a good feeling,” Brown said. “We have a home at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hours after President Drew G. Faust led a ribbon cutting ceremony celebrating the repeal of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy and the return of the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps to Harvard, Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 and a number of students spoke out against the University’s decision.
In an unusual twist, College administrators sponsored the rally and Faust delivered the opening remarks.
“The University is in a bit of pickle or queer situation where they have to mark both [NROTC’s return and students’ dissent],” McCarthy said.
Unlike many of the speakers that would follow—who criticized the University’s decision—Faust did not mention many of the most controversial issues, including the military’s exclusion of transgender people, that drew attendees to the rally.
“She did not talk about trans issues at all today, but I do appreciate her being a part of this event,” Jia Hui Lee ’12, the student head of the Trans Task Force.
Faust left the rally after she delivered her brief remarks—which highlighted the historic importance of the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” for gay, lesbian, and bisexual servicemen and women.
The speeches that followed criticized the University and expressed mixed emotions—joy that the repeal signifies a step toward greater equality and disappointment that it does not do more to advance queer rights.
The rally was one of several events organized to recognize the December repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the military policy that banned gays, lesbians, and bisexuals from serving openly in the military. In March, Faust announced that the University would begin officially recognizing NROTC. Tuesday, the repeal took effect.
But some Harvard community members have continued to voice opposition to the decision, arguing that the military violates Harvard’s non-discrimination policy since it does not allow people who are transgender to serve.
“Today marks a milestone in the long struggle for human rights,” McCarthy said. “But today is only a partial victory.”
“Incomplete justice is still injustice,” he added.
Some in attendance noted the unusual nature of the rally. Protests at Harvard have historically been student-led and anti-administration; however, this event was sponsored by the Office of Student Life.
“We didn’t want people protesting on the outside, on the periphery of this day,” said new Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life Emelyn A. dela Pena. “We wanted them to be a part of this day.”
Some student activists questioned the College’s motives for organizing the rally.
“As the leader of a student organization with members that identify as gender queer or gender non-conforming, to ask students not to protest the ribbon cutting to me is deeply disturbing,” Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Samuel Bakkila ’12 said. “We were never explicitly asked not to by the administration, but the undercurrent was there.”
The Office of Student Life paid for the travel expenses of keynote speaker Autumn Sandeen, who lives in San Diego.
Sandeen, a trans woman who served in the Navy for 20 years, said that the repeal did not go far enough.
“On this day when LGB people will serve openly, transgender people will still serve in silence,” Sandeen said, subsequently holding a moment of silence in support of trans service members. “The solution of one problem brings us face to face with another.”
Sandeen and other speakers also said that the repeal of DADT would not mean total equality for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in the military. Several said that married gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in the military would not receive the same benefits their straight peers do because gay marriage is not recognized on a national level.
Audience members—which totaled approximately 30, though numbers petered out as the ceremony progressed—echoed these sentiments.
“This was a big test for the non-discrimination policy, and it failed,” said James R. Sares ’12, who is gay and handed out pamphlets in protest at the ribbon cutting ceremony. “The policy should not be flexible for political opportunism. As a member of a marginalized minority, I hope that I won’t be thrown under the bus if it’s opportune for Harvard to do so.”
Still, others expressed a general opposition to the military and militarism.
“I would oppose ROTC's return to campus even if the military were an entirely inclusive institution,” said Lucy C. O’Leary ’12, who spoke at the event.
Several students said they wished that the administration was more transparent and consulted students when it was considering welcoming the military back on campus.
Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’11 said that the rally was an improvement over a protest in March, which featured students chanting from a distance while University officials signed a document welcoming NROTC back to Harvard.
“It’s better to have President Faust in dialogue—although it’s more like two parallel monologues than a true conversation—than yelling at her from across the lawn,” Wang said.

CORRECTION: SEPT. 21, 2011
The Sept. 21 article "On Day Hailed as Civil Rights Victory, Activists Say Trans Community Was Forgotten" misquoted Lucy C. O'Leary '12 as saying that she "would oppose the military returning to campus even if ROTC was an entirely inclusive institution." In fact, she said that she "would oppose ROTC's return to campus even if the military were an entirely inclusive institution." Additionally, the article misstated where Autumn Sandeen resides. She lives in San Diego, not San Francisco.

Christine Wu stands out on the volleyball court—but not because of her height. In a sport that is synonymous with long legs, Wu’s short stature could have proven to be a detriment. Instead, her passion for the game and relentless work ethic have proven to be more important than a couple of inches.
The team’s co-captain, Wu plays the position of libero, which is volleyball jargon for defensive specialist. The role of the libero is to control the back of the court and initiate passes to the setters, and Wu has excelled at this throughout her career with Harvard.
“She makes our defense and offense systems work well in terms of her ball control in the backcourt,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said.
On the court, Wu utilizes her quickness and her keen ability to read the play of her opponents to transform herself into a kind of human wall—rarely allowing balls to get past her.  Wu credits her vast volleyball experience at all levels of competition in giving her a seemingly intrinsic sense of the court.
Despite wearing kneepads, Wu still gets a fair share of scrapes and bruises on the court because she is constantly sacrificing her body, diving for the balls, and always striving to make a dig.
“I take pride in my position and playing for Harvard,” Wu said. “I love hitting the floor, making those great saving plays.”
Wu—who is generously listed at 5’4, and is the shortest on the team by a considerable margin—has begun her senior campaign with gusto.  The libero’s incredible defensive skills have manifested early this season—amassing 205 digs in the first 10 games of the preseason—which currently puts her number two in the Ivy League in this category.
The senior from Naperville, Ill., has had a very illustrious volleyball career for the Crimson.  Wu has been named All-Ivy honorable mention twice, and took second team All-Ivy honors her sophomore year.
As one of the most experienced players on the team, Wu has had some very memorable moments on the court representing Harvard.  Especially poignant in the defensive player’s mind was her squad’s tightly contested, five-set wins over Ivy League rival Princeton in home matches during the 2009 and 2010 seasons.
“When you play a great team like [the Tigers] and you play up to your potential, that just makes the victory more satisfying,” said Wu.
Princeton seems to be a favorite victim of the Adams resident. Wu recorded 40 digs against the Tigers in another home matchup.
The mark remains her career high for digs in a match.
Wu’s hard work has been evident thus far this season. On the team’s Sept. 9 match-up against Bryant University, Wu’s 26 digs were enough to etch her name in the Harvard women’s volleyball record books for third-most digs in a career.
“[Wu has] definitely matured over the years and is stepping right into the captain role,” Weiss said.  “She works hard, so I think that it rubs off on others around her ... she is leading by example.”
The Harvard women’s volleyball squad has started the season with a solid record of 7-3 in its first three tournaments of the season.  In those tournaments there has been one constant: Wu.
At each of the three tournaments in which the Crimson competed, she has been named to the All-Tournament team.
Off the court, Wu is a standout student. A Human Evolutionary Biology concentrator, Wu spent the past summer working at a Harvard Neurobiology Laboratory.  While spending time in the lab this summer, Wu still found time to train for her fall season by frequenting the Crimson’s weight-lifting center, Palmer Dixon, for early morning workouts.
Medical school is in Wu’s future, but she hopes to first take an unconventional detour: professional volleyball in Europe. In January she will go on an exposure tour in Europe to showcase her abilities to foreign scouts.
But Wu still has a job to get done in Cambridge. The women’s volleyball team hasn’t won an Ivy title since 2004, and Harvard opens its conference slate this weekend with a home match against Dartmouth, a team that denied the Crimson twice last year.
If Harvard is to break through this year, it will need its smallest player to step up and deliver another big performance.

Stepping up to the 13th tee on the first day of her first tournament as a collegiate athlete, freshman Tiffany Lim could feel the pressure.
“Everyone in my group had been playing well the whole day,” Lim said. “On that hole, the girls in my group all hit it really close.”
Unfazed, the freshman phenom lined up her five-wood. Prior the shot, Lim remembered thinking, “OK, now it’s my turn. I need to step it up.” Step up she did, driving the ball like an arrow along the line suggested by her coach to within two feet of the hole, setting up an easy birdie opportunity.
Lim continued her strong play through the first round of the Yale Intercollegiate Tournament en route to an impressive score of 70, two under par and one stroke back of the lead. After establishing herself near the top of the leaderboard, she posted back-to-back 74s in rounds two and three.
By the final hole, Lim had put herself in position to win the tournament with a 12-foot putt that strayed just wide, putting her into a tie with Yale sophomore Seo Hee Moon. But Lim didn’t know about the tie and only found out after she had finished that there might be a playoff. After finding her spikes in the car and putting them back on while mentally preparing herself for a playoff round, it was announced that the winner would be decided by a scorecard playoff, meaning that the player with the higher score in the first round, Moon, would be awarded the victory.
“I was disappointed because I didn’t get a chance to prove myself,” Lim said of the anticlimactic finish. “But I was also really happy with the way I played and the way that the team played. I think the joy that I had of being part of the team that came together that weekend outweighed all of the disappointment surrounding the lack of a playoff.”
“You never know if someone is going to hit the ground running so while I’m not surprised at all by what she did, she exceeded expectations because I don’t expect that to happen on the first time out,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said.
This was hardly Lim’s first time playing under pressure. Last summer, she successfully qualified for the U.S. Women’s Open and went on to make the cut, finishing in 68th place.
“Playing in the U.S. Open was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she explained. “It was the peak of my golf game. It was everything I’ve been working for.”
Lim also has learned to perform under pressure in practice, where she and her team put stakes on routine drills.
“I like putting something on the line. Sometimes we’ll play for pushups, sometimes we’ll play for food after practice. It just puts a little bit of pressure on you, and it’s fun,” she said.
Lim started this tradition of adding competition to practice with current teammate sophomore Bonnie Hu, a member of the Crimson business board, back when they were in high school in Northern California.
“It’s something we’ve always done,” Hu said. “It prepares us for tournaments because there is actually something on the line.”
The two women first met while playing tournaments early in their high school careers and became friends.
“She was one of my best friends,” Lim said. “We basically grew up playing golf together. It’s really nice having her as kind of a mentor or older sister here that I can look to for questions.”
Lim first picked up a golf club at the age of eight. Early on, she played because she liked riding in the golf cart and because she enjoyed spending time with her father, Andy Lim. When she began playing tournaments at age 11, her father attended every tournament he could and often caddied for her.
Early on, he could see the elegance in the young player’s swing. “It had power and beauty,” he said in an email. Still, the process of growth was not straightforward or simple.
The Rolex Junior All-American put it bluntly: “When I first started, I was really bad. I was shooting high 90s, really bad.”
The Yale Intercollegiate Tournament was only the second tournament Lim had played in without her father watching. While Lim was thriving under pressure, her father was having trouble handling the anxiety.
“I did struggle to go to bed at the conclusion of the second round when I found out online that Tiffany was one stroke behind the leader,” he wrote.
Going into the tournament though, the accomplished golfer had some butterflies in her stomach.
“I was nervous because I knew I had a lot of expectations going into the tournament,” she said. “[But] I knew I was prepared,” she said. “And if I just played my own game everything would turn out fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I boarded the bus around 4 p.m. on Sunday with the other members of the Harvard women’s soccer team, a single image was stuck in my mind: an improbable shot and the ball hitting net as the clock wound down in double overtime.
Rhode Island 3, Harvard 2. Final score.
The game was just one of many disappointing results for the Crimson this past weekend. Football dropped its first contest of the season to Holy Cross, men’s soccer lost 1-0 to Vermont after taking down UMass by the same margin, and Quinnipiac scored with less than ten minutes to play to secure a 4-3 win over the field hockey team.
Even mighty Auburn—to migrate away from the Ivy League for a minute—fell this weekend, as the defending national championship football team suffered its first loss in the last 18 games at Clemson.
And yet, as the end of September approaches, I can’t help but get excited.
It’ll still be at least a month or so until cool gives way to cold, forcing us all into hibernation mode and daring students to test the hypothesis that you can survive for at least a week in your respective House without physically stepping outside.
For now, a light sweater is all you need to brave the couple minute walk to class. And there’s something about the sting of cold air as it assails your nostrils that seems to signal the official end of summer and the beginning of something new.
September is a month of possibilities.
Although it may already feel like school is in full swing (calm down, it’s only week four), the arrival of October leaves fall sports teams here at Harvard with over a month still to play, including all—or most—of their respective Ivy League games. Each Ancient Eight soccer and football team begins this week with the same record: 0-0 in league play.
As much as it pains me to say it, this time of year reminds me of a storyline that unfolded during Super Bowl XLII (pardon the NFL reference; I’m more than a little preoccupied with fantasy football), as the Giants pulled off an upset over the undefeated Pats.
Before that game began, each team was asked to choose a word that defined them as a whole, and two quick, pre-recorded videos aired the results of this seemingly innocuous task.
First up, the Giants—who started the 2008 season with two losses and entered the Super Bowl on the tail of three playoff wins on the road—picked ‘resiliency.’
As I waited to see which word the Pats had come up with to counter it, I anticipated talk of a ‘dynasty,’ because, well, what word could better describe what was about to be the only team ever go 19-0 in an NFL season than the word TV announcers had been throwing around since week one? Records had already been broken; all that remained was to capture the ring.
Interestingly, what flashed across the screen instead was ‘teamwork.’ Important, sure, but is that the best you could come up with? A sports cliché? It seemed a little too similar to ‘resiliency,’ but without the bite, the tenacity, the edge.
My disappointment subsided momentarily as the game began. That is, until Resiliency began to metaphorically take down Teamwork, resulting in the most tragic pro sports loss I’ve ever watched in real time.
It occurred to me a few weeks after the game, when I finally became accustomed to those annoying t-shirts that splashed our almost-perfect record across too many of my friends’ chests (New Yorkers, of course), that it’s resiliency that characterizes a great team—or at least makes the best stories.
Maybe that’s why the end of September is my favorite time of the year and such an integral part of the fall athletic season.
At Harvard and virtually every college across the country, teams have suffered tough losses, captured thrilling last-second victories, come out too flat, and thoroughly dismantled their competition. But what remains to be seen is which teams will become stronger, better for these experiences.
Starting now, in September, we get to watch hundreds of seasons unfold. And although no one knows for sure who will come out on top after the next month or so—will it be the football team from Cambridge or Providence that notches its first win of the season this coming weekend?—I’m confident it will be gritty, resilient teams that win tough matchups when others falter.
October, like September, is just a part of their story.

At a three-way intersection five minutes down the road from the Quad, there's a gated park. With a patch of grass, a towering flag pole, a stone bench, and the occasional memorial flower, it looks much like any other public park—in miniature.
Taylor Square Park is the smallest public park in Cambridge. At 57 square feet, it's about half the size of a typical Winthrop House bedroom. And perhaps befitting its petite size, access to Taylor Square is granted only to an elite cadre.
Or maybe not. When the park first opened at the intersection of Garden, Sherman, and Huron Streets in 2009—the result of a city program called Percent for Art which mandates that 1 percent of funds spent on improvements go to public art—its creator, Paul Ramirez Jonas, made 5,000 keys to the square's iron gate and distributed them to local residents.
"I received the key in the mail. I do live in the neighborhood," said Stephen Prina, a Harvard professor of Visual and Environmental Studies. Along with the key was a letter encouraging recipients to make more copies to share. Prina gives a copy to every student in his "Loitering" course.
Lillian Hsu, director of public art and exhibitions at the Cambridge Art Council, said that the key concept is integral to the project. "The idea was to look at public space: who owns public space?" Hsu said.
But despite the business this might be bringing to Cambridge's keysmiths, the park has a little secret: the keys don't actually matter.
In fact, anyone can unlock the gate simply by reaching over the waist-high fence.
Key or no, those who come to Taylor Square enjoy the park, which rests on a concrete island in front of a fire station. "It’s very nice. It shows our patriotism and is seen by the neighborhood," Deputy Fire Chief James F. Burns said. "You could have a bit of peace and quiet in the middle of all the hubbub."

Last week, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced that Annenberg Dining Hall will remain open until midnight on weeknights, one of several steps she has taken lately to address students’ perennial complaints about lack of social spaces on campus. The extended hours allow freshmen to hang out in Annenberg from the time dinner begins at 4:30 p.m. until midnight, more than an hour after Brain Break food is cleared away.
 
In its first week, a few students took advantage of the new study space. "I come here if I don't want to be in Lamont," Sarah E. Coughlon '15 said as she and Audrey D. Zhang '15 worked on their computers in the nearly empty dining hall around 8:30 p.m.
 
"It's chill, relaxing," Zhang said. "I come when friends are here."
 
After Brain Break food came out at 9:15 p.m., the traffic picked up a bit. Students gathered in groups to talk and eat, though many said that a desire for a snack, not the new social hours, drew them to Annenberg. "I was hungry," said Alexander V. Moore '15. 
 
When Brain Break drew to a close, some lingered at tables as late as 11:30 p.m. even without muffins and fruit. Studying as midnight approached, Crystal K. Stowell '15 said that she enjoyed the openness of the space and bigger tables. "I want it to be open twenty-four/seven," she said.
