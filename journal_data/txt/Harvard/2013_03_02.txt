After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, “Jack the Giant Slayer” appears to be yet another blockbuster reimagining of a fairy tale, the product of Hollywood’s recent obsession with adapting children’s stories and adding an adult twist. From January’s “Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters” to last summer’s “Snow White and the Huntsman,” fairy tale adaptations have proved disappointing for the most part. The general formula of combining attractive stars with “grit” does not guarantee successful films, or even enjoyable ones. But “Jack the Giant Slayer” knows that it is a fairy tale, and this self-awareness saves it from many of the same pitfalls. 
Director Bryan Singer, best known for “The Usual Suspects” and several of the X-Men films, places a strong emphasis on impressive visuals and stunning special effects. At the film’s opening, we’re treated to a faithfully executed medieval setting with lavish costumes and sets. However, our later foray into the land of the giants reveals a truly extraordinary world, more expansive and colorful than our five-year-old imaginations could ever have conceived. The film is shot in 3D, which serves to accentuate specific visuals such as the beanstalk, a massive and intimidating being that seems capable of independent thought and action. 
Out to conquer this beanstalk is dashing farm boy Jack (Nicholas Hoult, 10 years after his work in “About a Boy”). In an opening true to the original fairy tale, Jack misguidedly trades his family’s horse to a monk for a sack of beans. The twist, thankfully not gritty, is that while he is in the market, Jack encounters Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), the princess of the kingdom of Cloister. Set to marry a man she doesn’t love, Isabelle is finally rebelling against the insularity and restrictiveness of her life. One plot contrivance later, and the two finally interact—until one of the aforementioned beans erupts into a beanstalk that carries the princess away to the land of giants, towards the sort of adventure she’s been seeking. 
Although Hoult and Tomlinson gradually develop a good chemistry with each other, the movie’s stand- out performance comes from Ewan McGregor in his portrayal of Elmont, leader of the king’s guard. It’s refreshing to see McGregor in a lighter role after serious films such as “The Impossible” and “Beginners,” and his balance between Elmont’s moments of comic relief and regal seriousness make for some of the best scenes in the film. 
In contrast, Stanley Tucci’s Roderick, the traitorous adviser and husband-to-be of Isabelle, comes off as buffoonish and caricaturish—fitting for a fairy tale villain, perhaps. The true standout antagonists are Bill Nighy and John Kassir as the re- spective big and little heads of Fallon, leader of the giants. Fallon shines as a vicious and vindictive villain with no mercy for humans. However, for the most part, the giants are merely fearsome and grotesque creatures born of CGI, crude and bumbling if only to help convince the audience that Jack can plausibly slay them. 
“Jack the Giant Slayer” consistently hits the right chord with its wry, almost tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. Especially in dialogue, we’re treated to what nearly qualifies as witty banter but perhaps is just clever wordplay (Roderick saying “spill the beans,” for instance). Moreover, the writing remains very faithful to the source material—elements from both the classic “Jack and the Beanstalk” tale and lesser-known Cornish story “Jack the Giant Killer” are deftly integrated without the spirit of either being compromised. Still, at some moments, the film seems to assume a young audience and deliberately walks viewers through certain plot points. Add this on top of several plot contrivances and a deus ex machina in the film’s latter half, and the predictability soon becomes tiresome. 
Nonetheless, “Jack and the Giant Slayer” is an enjoyable film—if taken as a fairy tale adaptation. The audience can’t expect innovative plot devices or new dimensions for the characters when most viewers have been familiar with the basic premise of the film since childhood. What do shine are the stunning visuals and the often clever writing, which transform what could have been a stilted premise into an exciting revisit of our childhood fantasies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—After a layup by sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi brought the score to a tie for the first time on Friday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team had a chance to break its 24-year losing streak at Jadwin Gymnasium.
And after senior forward Ian Hummer and Moundou-Missi traded free throws, Moundou-Missi came down with a rebound and drew the foul on the other end, converting the three-point play and giving the Crimson its first lead of the night.
But the Tigers (16-9, 9-2 Ivy) would not go down without a fight, and fouls down the stretch doomed Harvard (17-9, 9-3) to another road loss, 58-53, tying the two teams in the defeat column.
“Our focus was to see if we could play well enough to come here and win, and we came close again,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “The big stat for me is just five assists for us as a team and the rebounding margin that they put up. It’s not a big mystery that we came up short after that.”
After junior forward Will Barrett went to the line and hit two with 2:30 left to play, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers—looking to find senior guard Christian Webster—threw the ball away on a long cross-court pass, and a Hummer put-back handed Princeton a one-point lead.
Following the next timeout, Chambers rolled in a reverse layup to put the Crimson up again, 53-52. After Hummer knocked down two more free throws—part of a 7-for-7 effort from the stripe on the night—the Moundou-Missi missed a layup on the other end and failed to convert off his offensive board, handing the ball back to the Tigers.
Harvard would not score again, as Moundou-Missi grabbed the ball after a Crimson miss but came down out of bounds in the ensuing scramble, resulting in a turnover. The Tigers added their final six points from the charity stripe.
Down by three with 2.7 seconds to play, sophomore forward Jonah Travis inbounded the ball as the Crimson looked to tie the game. But the pass was knocked away by Hummer into Tigers guard TJ Bray’s hands, and he was fouled by junior co-captain Laurent Rivard—his fifth of the night—and made two free throws, securing the Tigers’ win.
“Certainly a tough loss for us,” Amaker said. “Both teams really gave incredible effort.... We were not very good offensively or efficiently, making shots and doing what we normally do. That was because of how hard they play and how tough they played [Friday night].”
In the first half, Princeton jumped out to a quick lead after Harvard failed to score on its first four possessions, but sophomore Wesley Saunders put the Crimson on the board with a short jumper two minutes in.
The Tigers opened up an eight-point lead—their biggest of the half—after five minutes. Princeton relied on a strong half-court press to limit the Crimson to 28.6 percent shooting in the first half and finished the period up by six.
“All week in practice we just focused on closing out on the guys,” Bray said. “Rivard got fouled on two threes, but we did a good job in making sure nobody got a lead.”
Princeton continued its hot streak in the second half, going up by 10 when senior forward Mack Darrow hit the first three of the night after Hummer came down with an offensive board. Hummer led the Tigers with 23 points and 14 rebounds, including nine in the first half, and jumped into second place on Princeton’s all-time scoring list.
“It means nothing if we didn’t get the win,” Hummer said. “It’s icing on the cake. First and foremost, we are competing for an Ivy League playoff, and we came to win.”
Bray’s three—the only shot made from deep on the night—came halfway through the second period. The Crimson went 0-for-8 from behind the arc, with half of its shots coming from Webster.
Coming off the bench with 31 minutes of playing time, Moundou-Missi led Harvard with 15 points and eight rebounds. The sophomore relied on efficient shooting, going 7-for-7 from the line and 4-for-6 from the field.
Saunders added 11 points—but only four in the second half—and Chambers chipped in 10. The Crimson was out-rebounded, 37-24.
“I thought Saunders did a decent job,” Amaker said. “His shooting percentage was low, but we need other guys to step forward. Saunders and Chambers, they are our playmakers and the focus of the other team’s scouting report.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 1 Quinnipiac men’s hockey had not lost a single away game (10-0-2) all year. The Bobcats (24-5-5, 17-2-3 ECAC) were undefeated  in 18 games after leading after two periods (16-0-2) and had not dropped an ECAC contest since October.
That all changed off a tip from Alex Fallstrom.
The senior forward’s overtime goal with 18.6 seconds left in the extra frame lifted Harvard to a 2-1 upset at the Bright Hockey Center Friday evening. In its penultimate game of the season, the last-place Crimson (9-17-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) found a way to knock off a top-ranked team for the first time since 2004.
“We’ve been facing a lot of adversity. We haven’t been winning as much as we’d like [with] a lot of injuries,” Fallstrom said. “But the one thing that’s really cool is that we never stop believing in ourselves. We just kept working, came down to the rink every day, battling, and today that pays off, so it feels really good.”
With less than 30 seconds left in overtime, it appeared that Harvard would leave the ice with a moral victory. For the Crimson, which entered the game poised to become the first squad in program history to finish at the bottom of the ECAC, a 1-1 tie against the No. 1 team in the county wouldn’t have been too shabby.
But Greg Gozzo had other plans. The freshman forward forced a turnover at the Quinnipiac blueline knocking the puck onto the stick of classmate Jimmy Vesey. With just under 20 ticks left, Vesey connected with Fallstrom on a tape-to-tape, backdoor feed for the game winner.
“Vesey made a beautiful pass to Fallstrom, and I think the unsung hero there was Gozzo,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Our guys, they battled to the last second, and I’m happy for the guys because we’ve worked real hard. We’ve been close to making some plays at key times in the game, and tonight we were able to make them.”
After a scoreless opening frame, Bobcat senior foreward Ben Arnt emerged from a scramble in front of the net to push a rebound past junior Harvard goaltender Raphael Girard with just over five minutes left in the second period. Quinnipiac continued to challenge Girard, who finished the night with 33 saves, in the final minutes of the second frame but settled for a 1-0 lead after 40 minutes.
The tide turned in the third period as the Crimson outshot the Bobcats, 12-5, in the final frame of regulation. Quinnipiac had outshot Harvard, 26-18, in the first two frames.
Less than six minutes into the third, senior forward Marshall Everson found freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo open along the left wing. The freshman forward threatened a cross-ice pass to classmate Brian Hart before launching a wrister from within the faceoff circle. The shot sailed past the glove Quinnipiac goaltender Eric Hartzell (33 saves) for Criscuolo’s sixth of the season and third in the last two games.
“I knew that [Hartzell] would be thinking I might pass it, so I pulled the puck back, made sure that he knew that I would have the opportunity to pass it if I wanted to, and went short-side,” Criscuolo said.
The final minutes saw close calls on both sides. Hartzell poke-checked away a point-blank attempt by Criscuolo midway through the third. In overtime, Girard was forced to make a couple of close leg saves to keep the Crimson in the game. Fallstrom provided the highlight of the night with his seventh goal of the season.
Quinnipiac entered Saturday’s game with a 12-point lead in the ECAC standings and a first-place conference tournament seed locked up. But Bobcats coach Rand Pecknold felt that his team’s comfortable position in the rankings did not affect its play.
“Our guys, they played hard tonight,” Pecknold said. “I don’t think it’s a motivational thing; I think our guys competed their tails off tonight. We just didn’t play smart. We made a lot of small, little mistakes, and we’ve got to clean up some errors.”
The Crimson had last defeated a team ranked No.1 in a 3-1 home win over Boston College on Nov. 17, 2004. Quinnipiac’s last in-conference loss was a 5-1 defeat to Colgate on Oct. 27 at a neutral rink in Hyannis, Mass.
After an eight-game losing streak consumed most of January and the beginning of February, the Crimson has posted a 4-1-2 record in its last seven games.  Harvard’s chronically depleted roster has recently shown flashes of the squad that made a run to last year’s ECAC final, gaining strength and confidence along the way.
“After the BU game, the seniors really stepped up, and I think they’ve really been leading the way as of late,” Criscuolo said. “It continues to boost our confidence going into the playoffs.”
“You could argue that there wasn’t a lot to gain from the standings perspective, but I think there is a lot of pride in our locker room,” Donato added.
The overtime win allowed the Crimson to draw within a point of 11-th place Colgate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a 33-game Ivy League winning streak on the line and down by one with 2:11 remaining, Princeton guard Niveen Rasheed stepped up to the free-throw line. After going 7-of-8 from the charity stripe on the day, Rasheed tossed up the first, which clanked off the backboard. Her second attempt rimmed in and—just like many Tigers’ attempts Friday night—rimmed out.
Although a well-placed inbounds pass allowed Princeton to cut the lead to one with 22 seconds remaining, a clutch performance by senior forward Victoria Lippert and a strong defensive stand ensured that the Tigers wouldn’t find its 34th straight win on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
Behind Lippert, who has now put up double figures in each of her last seven games, the Harvard women’s basketball team (16-8, 7-3 Ivy) withstood a late Princeton surge to remain undefeated at home and beat the Tigers (18-6, 9-1) for the first time in over two years, 58-55.
“I think that throughout the year, we’ve been in a lot of close games,” junior guard Christine Clark said. “That actually played to our favor tonight because we’ve been in this situation before, so we knew that we could pull out the win. I think we had them running scared a little bit.”
After coming out of the half with a four-point lead over Princeton—a situation that the Tigers haven’t found themselves in during Ivy League play since its 2011 matchup against the Crimson—coach Kathy Delaney-Smith was cautious of becoming too confident too quickly against a dangerous Princeton team.
“We’ve had an early 12-point lead on them down at Princeton,” Delaney-Smith said. “That doesn’t even bother them. They have kids that catch and shoot threes and hit big shots, they have great rebounding in Niveen and others, and they are really, really good in the open court.”
Neither team seemed to be able to find any offensive momentum to begin the second half until sophomore guard Ali Curtis netted the first bucket of the half on either side, a triple, after over four minutes had elapsed. In the first 10 minutes of the half, eight of the Tigers’ 10 points came from behind the charity stripe, a sign of Harvard’s early foul trouble.
“I think we should have gotten to the line,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re a very physical team, I think we have to do a better job of getting ourselves to the line… In the second half, their offense wasn’t doing anything. It was the free-throw line and rebounds.”
The Crimson built a lead as big as seven in the second half with 9:45 remaining, but then the Princeton offense came to life. Fueled by a flurry of offensive rebounds, the Tigers went on a 7-2 run to tie the game for the first time. The teams traded buckets until junior guard Missy Mullins fouled Rasheed as she pulled down her fifth offensive rebound of the game. With Harvard over the limit, the senior went to the line and knocked both down, giving Princeton its first lead since 14:25 in the first half.
“They are a very good offensive team, and I really do think that Niveen is the motor behind it,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re a very good rebounding team, and Niveen is probably the best rebounder in the league, in every regard. Her second, third, fourth jumps are so quick, so athletic, so when all else fails, she went to town in rebounds.”
But the Crimson had an answer to every run by the Tigers, and Lippert, the Ivy League’s top free-throw shooter, sunk four in succession to give Harvard the lead with 20 seconds left. Princeton inbounded and missed two treys in a row before the buzzer rang.
“She has done that all four years,” Delaney-Smith said. “She is and always has been ice.”
Although Harvard only converted 37.5 percent of its field goals, the Crimson held the Tigers to just 25.8 percent shooting, its lowest of the season. Even while out-rebounding Harvard 47-39, Princeton had tough looks all night and only converted on 16 of 62 attempts.
“We were really wanting to focus on transition defense for this game, because we know that’s where they primarily like to score in their offense,” Lippert said. “They’re not as comfortable in half-court sets.”
Rasheed led the Tigers’ offensive campaign with her 12th double-double of the year, tallying 13 points and 11 boards, while Lippert led the Crimson with 21. Clark also joined the senior in double figures, racking up 14 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—Princeton senior Ian Hummer sat for just three minutes in Friday night’s contest against Harvard.
“[What] else can you say about the kid?” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said about Hummer. “He made every big play down the stretch for that team, whether it was a tip-in, free throws, intercepting the last pass, whatever he had to do. He was a monster.”
On the defensive end, Hummer’s main assignment was Harvard co-captain Christian Webster, who was held scoreless for only the second time this season. Hummer finished with numbers above his season averages, scoring 23 points and grabbing 14 rebounds.
With the night’s performance, Hummer moved into second all-time on the Tigers’ scoring charts—a feat that he says would not have mattered to him if Princeton had lost the game. The only Princeton player currently ahead of him is William Bradley, who ended his Tiger career with 2,503 points 48 years ago.
“[It’s] fun to watch him play,” Princeton coach Mitch Henderson said. “I’m proud that he wears the orange and black. He does everything for us. He’s really worked hard, especially at free throw shooting. He’s constantly improving.”
EARNING HIS [CHARITY] STRIPES
Three possessions after a long-distance shot extended Princeton’s lead to a game-high 10 points, the Tigers squad did exactly what almost any other team does when sophomore forward Steve Mondou-Missi receives a pass on the low block. They intentionally fouled him, choosing to give the traditionally shaky free-throw shooter a chance to prove himself at the line rather than score two easy-points. Mondou-Missi, who shoots just 66.7 percent from the charity stripe on the season, sunk each shot, avoiding the rim for a perfect swish on each.
After he grabbed three consecutive defensive rebounds and put in a layup at the 7:29 mark of the second period, Moundou-Missi caught the ball at the left elbow, hesitated, took several dribbles to reach the baseline, and splashed in a short-corner baby-hook. The game, for the first time since the opening tip, was tied with 4:02 remaining.
A number of Moundou-Missi’s openings were made possible by his screen-and-roll play with freshman Siyani Chambers, which Amaker said the two ran well late in the game.
“[The pick-and-rolls] pushed us and got us in the lead” Amaker added.
After Hummer made two free throws on the other end to regain the Princeton advantage, Mondou-Missi did his best impression of the Tiger senior as he sank both of his ensuing free throw attempts. And, after Tigers senior center Brendan Connolly missed a jumper on one side of the court, Moundou-Missi received the ball once again at the left short-corner position, drove hard to the basket, and knocked in the layup while drawing a foul. With the score and the foul shot, his seventh free throw of the day, the Crimson gained a three-point lead—its first advantage on the night.
While turnovers would go on to doom Harvard’s chances to win the contest, Mondou-Missi finished the game with team-highs in points, 15, and rebounds, eight.
“Steve did a terrific job,” Amaker said. “[With] his numbers, being seven-for-seven from the foul line, and [leading] us in rebounds…We are having him to do a heck of a lot there.”
THREES [DRAW] A CROWD
In a contest billed as a matchup between two sharp-shooting three-point teams who average a combined 39.15 percent from beyond the arc, misses were abundant, closeouts were consistent, and swishes were close to nil on Friday night. Harvard and Princeton, who lead the Ivy League in three-point percentage, went a combined 1-for-18 from downtown, forcing the already-close contest to be played close to the basket.
When the squads last faced off, the Crimson shot treys at a clip of 38.9 percent. On Friday, after a poor shooting first half, a shot from deep with seconds remaining on the clock was ironically exactly what Harvard needed to extend the game into overtime. But an interception prevented any last-chance attempt, and the contest was officially marked as the first of the season in which Harvard did not make a single three-pointer.
As the scouting reports on both teams coming into the game emphasized long-range shooting, each side’s defensive scheme relied heavily on closing-out around the arc, increasing the difficulty of each attempt.
Perhaps as a result of the augmented pressure outside, a majority of the Tigers’ offense was shifted inside, and the squad attempted 19 layups for the game—seven more than the Crimson put up. While Harvard made a total of nine lay-ins, Princeton converted on 12—a difference of six points in a game with a final spread of only five.
The only made three of the night was one converted by 6’9” Tiger senior Mack Darrow at the 9:57 mark of the second period. With the shot, Princeton continued its streak of making at least one three-pointer in every game since the three-point line was brought to collegiate play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—The Harvard men’s basketball team left Cambridge on Thursday as a heavy favorite to three-peat as Ivy League champion, boasting a 1.5-game lead over Princeton in the conference standings.
The Crimson returns to Cambridge needing a prayer to extend its season.
Following Friday night’s loss at Princeton, Harvard couldn’t keep up with Penn, falling, 75-72, at the Palestra.
The Quakers’ relentless defensive pressure stalled Harvard’s offense in the opening frame, as the Crimson was held to 26.1 percent shooting and went into halftime trailing, 38-26.
Harvard found an offensive rhythm in the second frame, but the Crimson was unable to pull even with the Quakers (8-20, 5-6 Ivy), who grabbed timely offensive rebounds and hit eight of 12 free throws in the final two minutes.
“We got [the win] because we are a relatively young team and the effort and intensity and attention to detail on the defensive end tonight was fantastic,” said Penn coach Jerome Allen, whose team forced 16 turnovers and held the Crimson to 40.4 percent shooting on the night.
Despite trailing throughout the second half, the Crimson had a chance to send the game into overtime at the buzzer. With 2.4 seconds remaining, sophomore Jonah Travis sent a full-court pass to classmate Wesley Saunders, who tapped it out to co-captain Christian Webster on the perimeter. But Webster’s attempt fell short, and the Crimson walked off the court with its Ivy title hopes greatly diminished.
Coupled with the Tigers’ victory over Dartmouth on Saturday night, Harvard (17-9, 9-3) now trails by a game in the loss column with two contests remaining.
For the Crimson to extend its season, Harvard will need to sweep next weekend’s contests against Cornell and Columbia, and the Tigers (19-9, 9-2) will need to drop one of their three remaining road contests at Brown, Yale, or Penn.
“As I mentioned to our kids, we have seen a lot of interesting things happen in our league already,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We have two games to play, and we are going home. No matter what happened here [Saturday night] or [Friday] night, it’s the same: We are going home to finish out our regular-season schedule.”
The Quakers received stellar performances from two of its rookies—freshmen Tony Hicks and Darien Nelson-Henry—who combined for 42 points, 15 rebounds, and six steals.
Coming off a 23-point effort in the Quakers’ 69-64 loss to Dartmouth on Friday night, Hicks continued to fill the basket on Saturday. The guard posted a game-high 24 points on 9-of-17 shooting and added five assists and three steals.
“I thought he was the difference,” Amaker said.
In the post, the Crimson couldn’t find an answer for the 6’11” Nelson-Henry who posted a double-double with 18 points (8-of-13 shooting) and 11 rebounds.
Harvard center Kenyatta Smith—whose near triple-double was critical to the Crimson’s victory over the Quakers earlier this season—was neutralized on the offensive end, posting seven points on just two-of-seven shooting.
Sophomore Wesley Saunders finished with a team-high 20 points on 10 shots. The wing was the Crimson’s primary source of offense in the opening half—contributing 15 of Harvard’s 26 points—but was held to just five in the second.
After going two of 10 from beyond the arc in the first half, the Crimson received a boost from Webster and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard in the second, who combined for seven of the team’s eight second-half three-pointers.
But it was not enough to make up for the Crimson’s slow start.
Hicks sparked the Quakers offense early, scoring nine of Penn’s first 15 points to help the hosts jump out to an early 15-8 lead.
Midway through the period, the rookie gave the Quakers their first double-digit lead of the contest, rattling home a three-pointer off a kick-back from Miles Cartwright in transition to make it 22-12.
Cartwright—who entered the contest as Penn’s leading scorer—scored just four points in the opening frame but gave the Quakers their biggest lead of the period, 38-22, off a jumper with 41 seconds remaining.
“That was one of the keys to the game. They really disrupted us and got us on our heels,” Amaker said. “Transition wise they had it up our throats and had us backpedaling a lot…. Next thing you know we are down early and we are down big.”
The Crimson made use of the charity stripe in the final seconds of the first, pulling within 12 off four straight free throws heading into the break.
Coming out of the break, the Crimson began chipping away at the Quakers’ lead, pulling within seven, 44-37, off a deep Webster triple from the top of the key with 12:00 to play.
But Hicks answered with a turnaround jumper and then capitalized on a Harvard turnover with a transition layup to put Penn back up by 11. Following a Webster miss, the Quakers’ Greg Louis stuck a jumper to give Penn its largest lead of the period.
But the Crimson made another push. Fueled by eight points from Rivard and four from sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi, Harvard went on a 14-6 run to cut Penn’s deficit to five with 6:15 to play.
Thirty-four seconds later, Wesbter drilled a three-pointer in front of the Crimson’s bench to make it a four-point game.
Harvard forced a Hicks miss on the other end, but Nelson-Henry was there for the tip-in to put Penn back up by six.
Rivard answered with a triple to make it a three-point game, but the Crimson once again surrendered an offensive rebound on the other end that turned into two more Penn points.
The Crimson cut Penn’s lead to four points three times over the next 3:25, but each time the Quakers didn’t let it get closer than that.
With 13 seconds left, the Crimson finally made it a one-possession game when Chambers connected on his first field goal of the game, a running three-pointer off the glass to make it 72-69.
Penn successfully inbounded the ball to Cartwright, who was sent to the line and hit both free throws with 11 ticks left.
The Crimson pushed the ball up the court and found Webster for three to make it a two-point game with four seconds to play.
Harvard sent Hicks to the line with 2.4 seconds on the clock, and the rookie went one of two, setting up the Crimson’s unsuccessful final play.
Harvard will get a chance to rebound from its pair of weekend losses when it hosts Columbia on Friday and Cornell on Saturday to close out the regular season.
“We are disappointed,” Amaker said. “We have not played particularly well this weekend; we give all the credit to Princeton and Penn, and they did what they needed to in order to win the basketball game, but we know we can play better and we are confident that once we get home we will.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—Heading into its key Ivy matchup Saturday night against Penn, the Harvard men’s basketball team was in possession of the largest winning streak at the Palestra of any Ivy team.
But for the first time in four years, the Quakers (8-20, 5-6 Ivy) emerged from their home contest against the Crimson (17-9, 9-3) on top, 75-72, narrowly avoiding being swept on the weekend at home and handing Harvard its second loss in as many days.
“Congratulate Penn on a terrific effort,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “The opening of the game and their intensity and defensive pressure was terrific, and I’m sure [Quakers’ coach Jerome Allen] is really excited and proud of his kids.”
The last time the Crimson dropped both of its games at the Killer P’s was during the 2007-08 campaign—a season in which Harvard tallied just three wins in league play.
But though the contest closed out an especially tough weekend for the Crimson—Harvard lost to Princeton by a slim margin Friday night—it was not the first time in recent memory that Penn spoiled a Crimson streak. In the two teams’ contest at Lavietes Pavilion last season, Penn walked away with a one-point victory, ending what was then the second-longest home winning streak in the country (27 games).
THREES COMPANY
After going 0 of 8 from deep against Princeton, the Crimson—a team that averaged a .401 three-point percentage entering the weekend—appeared to be destined for another ineffective night from beyond the arc.
“Our numbers have not been what we need them to be to win the last few games,” Amaker said.
In the first half of its contest against the Quakers, Harvard made just two of its 10 attempts from three, as co-captain Christian Webster knocked down a pair of shots with 15:18 and 9:44 remaining in the half, respectively.
But in the second frame, clutch three-pointers were largely responsible for keeping the Crimson in the game. Co-captain Laurent Rivard, who was kept off the scoreboard in the first despite attempting four shots from deep, made four three-pointers in the final 9:39, including a bomb from NBA range that narrowed the score to four with 1:38 left to play.
Webster added three more treys in the second half on the way to a 5-for-10 effort, as the co-captains combined for 30 points on the night.
Chambers also contributed a make from deep in the waning minutes of the contest, as the Crimson shot an impressive 72.7 percent from long range while also contributing a 13-for-24 (54.2 percent) effort from the field in the period.
But despite increased shooting prowess in the latter frame of Saturday evening’s contest, Webster’s final attempt from three—a rushed shot from the corner in the final seconds of play that would have sent the game into overtime—missed the basket entirely, and the Crimson ended up suffering its second defeat of the weekend.
NOBODY FRESH-ER
While Harvard’s eldest players—Webster and Rivard—led a late offensive surge that nearly evened the contest, consistent play from two Penn freshman helped secure a win for the home team.
After scoring 23 in the Quakers’ loss to Dartmouth Friday night, rookie Tony Hicks did one better against the Crimson. Hicks tallied a game-high 24 points on 9-of-17 shooting, including the game’s final point—a free throw with two seconds left on the clock.
At the onset of the first half, Hicks carried the Quakers’ offense, contributing seven of his team’s first nine points, as Penn amassed a 9-3 lead it would maintain for the entirety of the game. The rookie had 16 points in that frame, including two straight layups to bolster his team’s lead to 14 with 3:02 to playing in the opening period.
Penn’s Darien Nelson-Henry also had an impressive night for the Quakers, posting 18 points and a game-best 11 rebounds. His presence in the paint—the rookie notched 16 points inside and two more from the charity stripe—helped push his team to a 34-14 advantage down low. The Quakers also bested Harvard in second-chance points by a key five-point margin.
“I take my hat off to them,” Allen said of the duo. “It is their first rodeo, and tonight they played like it mattered to them and they were seasoned veterans. We wish we had seniors to show them the way, but it is what it is. There is no better type of experience than being on the floor.”
For the second time this season, the Quakers held Harvard’s top rookie—freshman point guard Siyani Chambers—to just five points on the game. Chambers has averaged 12.9 points per game so far this year.

Issa Rae is the creator of the beloved and critically acclaimed YouTube Series "The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl," in which she stars as J, a hilariously honest—and, yes, awkward—young woman dealing with the trials and tribulations of everyday life. On campus this weekend for a conference at Harvard Law School, she chatted with Flyby about the importance of embracing the awkward, from stop signs to higher education.
Flyby: How much of J's experiences [on the show] come from your own personal experience?
Issa Rae: A lot of J's experiences haven't happened to me except the poor awkward moments like the stop sign… all the awkward moments have happened to at some point in my life. But her life is not my life. She handles things in a way that I wouldn't.
Flyby: Do you think you're similar to J?
IR: Yeah… I'm nicer than she is. She has the worst thoughts in life, but she's an extension of me. She thinks things that sometimes I think, but out loud. She's 30 to 40 percent me, it varies. It depends on the day.
 
Flyby: What's the most awkward thing that's ever happened to you?
IR: It's everyday in life. I think sixth grade defines my awkwardness. We moved from Maryland to LA, and in Maryland I had all these interracial friends and we were all black girls and I was used to that. Then I moved to a predominantly black neighborhood in LA, and they hated me because I wore my hair naturally and I had this weird sense of humour to them, and I was just super goofy. Everything I did was like, "I want to be black, too! I'm black, guys!" Looking back on it, it's very embarrassing.
 
Flyby: There are a lot of awkward people at Harvard. Do you have any advice for them?
IR: I would say embrace it. At Stanford there were definitely like, hella awkward people but if you just embrace it and know who you are… the worst thing you can do is try to hide it. I would say get comfortable with your awkwardness.
 
Flyby: Why do you think Awkward Black Girl has been so popular? What do you think it takes to make a YouTube video go viral?
IR: I think it was good timing. I think specifically because there's a lead female of color, and at the time on television there wasn't. She's relatable, she goes through things that everybody goes through; everybody's been uncomfortable, everybody's been awkward at some point. I think that's the reason it's become so popular. I think to go viral you have to tap into something that's universal and that people can look at and go, "That's so me!" or, "That's so my friend!" People want to see themselves depicted in the characters. Or it has to be a cat video.
 
Flyby: We know you left Stanford [where Rae received a B.A.] for a time to go to the New York Film Academy. How did you find your time at college helpful to your craft? Do you have advice for college students who have a similar passion for the arts but aren't really finding the outlets for it at their current colleges, or aren’t fitting it in with their studies?
IR: There's two options. If you feel like you can't get out of your current college because your parents are paying for it, then I would strongly suggest taking advantage of your school's resources. That's what I did for the latter half of my time at college. There are so many grants at schools, so many free materials, free equipment at your disposal, and in real life that never happens. Like, outside of college it's like, "No one's going to give me things for free anymore? This is it?!" Take advantage. I got grants to put on plays, and that way I was able to experiment with directing and writing and just putting on shows. That's a great outlet, but just do the research. And because I went to a school where it wasn't about the arts, no one was taking advantage of those. 
The other option is if you do get the chance to leave school, really just use that time wisely to network and to figure out what it is you want to do. I think that I'm having second thoughts about my college experience now because I didn't learn anything. It was great for meting people, and I'm working with everyone that I met there, and it was great for honing my craft, but I didn't learn anything in college. I would go back and take it seriously if I could.
 
Flyby: What projects do you have coming up?
IR: I'm working on being an executive producer, bringing out other artists. I started because I wanted to see more representation of people of color in the media, and I'm seeing there are a lot more webseries coming out now. There are a lot more writers putting out their work. Now I'm like, "My voice has been heard, and I want to help their voices be heard." Iim also working on a television show with Shonda Rhimes called "I Hate LA Dudes," and working on Awkward Black Girl's movie.
 
Flyby: What is the advantage of having a web series as opposed to a TV show?
IR: You can literally write something, and it's flawed, but you can put it out there and people will either love it or they'll hate it or they just don't care. With TV there are so many voices that are involved; there's the studio, then the network, then there's the producers. The first joke that comes to your mind is filtered down. But then I'm no one on television, so if I were someone like Louis CK I could put my own stuff out there and write and direct and literally give it to a channel to air. If you can turn television into a web series, that's ideal, but with TV there's just a lot of input.
 
Flyby: Could you give us any insights as to what's in store for Awkward Black Girl in Season Three?
IR: Wow, I honestly have no idea. I haven't said I'll do a Season Three. I always planned on doing one season, so the second season was already like, "Ok, people are asking for this, great," so a third season is like, "Really?" If I did do a third season I would solely want to do awkward moments. I wouldn't even want to do a story line.

Ever since students signed Yuqi Hou '15's petition rallying for a space to nap in Harvard Yard, numerous media outlets have chimed in to opine on the idea. While some applaud the concept, others find it further proof of Harvard students' snobbery.
Is a cozy room for a quick snooze a brilliant idea or an awkward encounter waiting to happen? Here's what some have to say on the matter.
Lauren Landry, BostInno: "What I think, however, is that Harvard students are complaining about merely being college students."
This article drips with sarcasm, mocking "the woes of a Harvard student" and arguing that we need to let go of our preschool days, suck it up, and drink another "grande soy caramel macchiato with whipped cream." What it doesn't take into account is Harvard's punishing geography for weary Quad residents, who are faced with a 15-minute commute by foot to get to class in the Yard. It is often not feasible for these students to return to their dorms for a nap, when the two-way trip will take 30 minutes.
Though we don't appreciate the condescending tone, we do enjoy the photo gallery of "unflattering faces you might make in a communal nap room" that accompanies the article.
Red Politics: "In case Harvard University needed another reason to be superior, a nap room for students to snooze in between classes might be in the works."
Despite the predictably snarky lede, this article is a bit more reasonable, focusing on the benefits of napping during the day. Naps can increase productivity and enhance problem solving, while minimizing the sleep deficit that many overbooked Harvard students confront. And yes, we agree, a nap space could be the clincher over Yale (especially now that football is no longer a competition).
Huffington Post: "We can't say we disagree with Hou's idea. We have nap rooms here at the Huffington Post, and they're often overbooked."
As proud supporters of their own office nap space, the Huffington Post has an experienced take on the controversy. Citing Harvard Medical School professor Robert Stickgold, the article emphasizes the importance of an ideal spot to nap, with reduced light, little noise, and cool temperatures. Maybe a nap space is a practical solution for fatigued upperclassmen schlepping their lives on their backs through the Yard after all.
