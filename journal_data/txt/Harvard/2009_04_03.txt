After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once upon a time, a young physics concentrator with a penchant for cakes and a talented artist with a smile as big as his tower of hair flew to Paris on a mission to unveil inhalable chocolate to the world. By day they scoured the finest boutiques in Paris for chocolate to use in their product. Money was no object. By night they stayed in a beautiful hotel near the Louvre. When they had all their supplies, the artist and the scientist hand-ground chocolate in preparation for their invention’s big reveal. The day finally came. In the corner of the dark, smoky gallery, the artist and the scientist unleashed “Le Whif” onto the world. “Orange or Gingerbread?” they asked. Which is more fantastical: the existence of inhalable chocolate or the implausible story behind it?It all started in the fall of 2007 when my former roommate Larissa H. Zhou ’10, the physics concentrator, and Trevor J. Martin ’10, the artist, signed up for Professor David Edwards’ class Engineering Sciences 147: “Idea Translation: Effecting Change through the Arts and Sciences.” Edwards, who made his name and fortune by inventing an inhalable tuberculosis vaccine, began teaching this course to inspire students to think outside the boundaries of academic disciplines, with the goal of demonstrating how a specific idea might be transformed into reality, taking social, cultural, and economic concerns into account. Students need not actually follow through on these development plans, although many do. Lebônê, the project to bring sustainable lighting solutions to Africa that recently won a $200,000 World Bank grant, was born in Edwards’ class. Students are free to choose from a variety of group projects, which are based on the work of experts that visit the class every week. The year that Zhou and Martin took ES 147, Inhalable Food was one of the options. Zhou jumped at the topic because of her culinary passions, and Martin, because his graphic design experience would be invaluable for marketing. Travis May ’09, an economics concentrator, and Jonathan Kamler ’07, a physics concentrator who had taken Edwards’ class the year before and stayed to do post-grad work in the Idea Translation Lab, also joined the team. Their brainstorming sessions in the Lowell dining hall were straight out of Willy Wonka. “We imagined neurocircuitry that would bypass the mouth altogether and target different parts of the brain for different smell and taste sensations,” Zhou said. “People would wear a helmet. There could be a pole attached to the ceiling. It would be like bumper cars.”They envisioned a room full of bubbles in which people could simply open their mouths and taste everything from rhubarb pie to artichokes as the bubbles popped. But the bubbles’ lipid membranes were too weak to support imbedded particles. They tried tea. They tried mint. They tried a chocolate hookah—but the flour-filled prototype left May coated in white and wheezing. By November, the group had still failed to come up with a viable product. Martin suggested using pipettes as a temporary solution: “We could stuff them and people could squeeze them.”  Suddenly Kamler jumped.  “My God, we have those inhalers!” he realized, referring to those that Edwards had developed for the TB vaccine. “Why didn’t I think that before?” The group moved quickly to produce inhalable chocolate, which they called Le Whif. Martin and May were in charge of marketing and packaging while Zhou and Kamler handled the science. The team ground chocolate endlessly using a mortar and pestle Martin happened to have for an art project. (Eventually they’d graduate to dining hall knives.) By December they had the prototype for their inhaler (“Guard it with your life!” Zhou remembers Kamler warning.).Le Whif, simply put, is an inhaler that contains about a gram’s worth of extremely tiny particles of chocolate. The holder is about the size and shape of a cigar, with colored tips that indicate the specific flavor inside. At one end of the plastic tube is a compartment that contains thousands of chocolate bits—small enough to aerosolize, large enough to linger in your mouth and not in your lungs. To use it, take a light drag—like a kiss, they say. The particles will pass through the filter and a fine cloud will coat the tongue and the roof of the mouth. Allow two to three seconds for the flavor to develop: subtly, but unmistakably, chocolate.By January, Martin, Zhou, and Kamler had decided to stick with the project into the next semester. They were working towards a grand exposition of molecular gastronomy in the basement gallery of Le Laboratoire, Edwards’ playground and brain station. The expo, to be held on March 28, 2008, would star the chef Thierry Marx, famous for his ventures into molecular gastronomy with the chemist Jerome Bibbett; it would also feature the Harvard team’s inhalable chocolate. The exposition, held in that dark, smoky gallery, treated the trendy French crowd to three-tiered bento boxes starring a suckling pear dipped in chocolate with a surprise mound of vanilla caviar nestled inside. A colloidal masterpiece. Sharing the stage was the Le Whif exhibition, which had paired with Nespresso, Nestle’s coffee line. The concept was to drink the coffee and take a puff. Pretty French girls draped themselves over the Nespresso deluxe machines. The clientele took light drags on the Whif. Zhou and Martin entertained frequent how-did-I-end-up-here thoughts. “People were arguing over how much orange they could taste,” Zhou said. “I mean, if it weren’t in a minimalist, dimly-lit gallery where guests sipped champagne and savored macaroons, it would have been ridiculous. But ridiculous in a laughable and fantastical kind of way.”Zhou paused, considering this statement. “It was eye-opening actually to see people take it that seriously. It’s about how powerful belief is, I guess. Whether it’s inhalable chocolate, or lighting Africa, it doesn’t matter how ridiculous or ambitious it seems. If you believe it, I think your passion can draw other people to it.” Over the next few months, Kamler continued researching and refining Le Whif. The group’s whimsical story was immortalized in a manga comic, Whiff. Finally, a year after its unveiling, Le Whif is ready to hit stores. It will be available in four flavors—mango, raspberry, mint, and original—and will go on sale in Paris starting April 7 at both Le Laboratoire and Colette, a trendy shop in the 1. This product of divine inspiration, surreal no longer, will go on a world tour later this year.—Staff writer Rebecca A. Cooper can be reached at cooper3@fas.harvard.edu.

Love, heartbreak, and moving have become popular clichés in movies, TV dramas, and novels. However, present these themes during the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic and make angels crash out of the sky, and you’ve got an epic theatrical production that explores everything from politics to romance to meteors; you’ve got “Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes.” Tony Kushner’s two-play work is the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Company’s first spring Loeb Mainstage production. While the first play, “Millennium Approaches,” debuted at Harvard more than a decade ago in 1997, Harvard has never performed the second play, “Perestroika.” Co-directed by Sara L. Wright ’09 and Laura S. Hirschenberg ’09 and produced by Elizabeth  J. Krane ’11 and Brittany L. Turner ’09, “Millennium Approaches” opens on April 3, 2009, followed by “Perestroika” on April 4, 2009. “Angels in America” was originally two plays written within two years of each other in 1991 and 1992, both winning Tony Awards for Best Play in 1993 and 1994, respectively, as well as a Pulitzer Prize. Over a total of six hours, the work follows the shifts, declines, and evolution of the relationships of two couples, one gay and one straight, in New York City in the 1980s.Despite the difficulty of undertaking such an epic production, both Wright and Hirschenberg knew that they wanted to see both parts on stage.“The two parts are two self-sufficient plays that are made into one continuous play,” Hirschenberg said. “It’s such a large undertaking, but it’s sort of a ‘sum is greater than the parts’ thing.”Wright agreed that the production is worth the challenge. “This play has never been done in its entirety before at Harvard, and we both considered that it’s one of our favorite plays of all time,” Wright said. “Laura and I knew that it would be a daunting task, but we wanted to do something that would be a challenge and also fulfilling for our senior spring.”A key element of the play is its meshing of reality and fantasy. One of the challenges both the cast and crew faced was how to interconnect these two realms together effectively to produce a moving play about the characters’ journeys to both physical and emotional wellness.“These fantastical scenes blend in effortlessly, so you have to be paying attention,” costume designer Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’11 said, who plays Belize, an ex-ex drag queen and nurse. “You slide from Brooklyn to Antarctica in one scene, for example.” In order to fully represent the fantastical elements of the plot, the sets were designed to be changed quickly. “Every scene is in a different place. We needed to decide what parts of the scene we were going to abstract at the set, what is it about the show we want to bring out and physicalize,” set-designer Beth G. Shields ’10 said. “There’s order and chaos working in the same space with the idea that things are spinning out of control in people’s lives. We have these roller moving set pieces that represent the fantastical and the physical furniture that helps us recognize the real world.”The stage will be set between the rows of the audience, like a runway, so that the two sections of the audience will be facing each other. “It makes the show more of an experience,” Shields says. “It makes the characters more realistic, because you see them with the audience and the audience’s reactions to everything that’s going on.”The plot uses issues of a specific time and place, such as homosexuality and the AIDS crisis, to make the cliché themes moving and realistic. “The play puts forth a lot of political ideas, but there are themes of love, about how can you be forgiven for doing something terrible,” Gus T. Hickey ’11, who plays Louis Ironson, a gay Jewish man who leaves his AIDS-infected lover. “The main lesson that the directors are trying to push is that you have to struggle with whatever life throws at you, that you can’t stand by and let life just pass you. You have to work with both the bad and good in life.” Because of the balance between tragedy and the supernatural, the show becomes touching without being melodramatic. The characters are passionate and have specific personalities, but the cast and crew strive to make their audiences relate with their stories.  “These characters, they’re not quite like you, but the things they go through are so relevant,” Hirschenberg said. “The play makes you see your own experiences in a different light. My personal experiences do not include homosexuality, and so it’s phenomenal for me to see that there’s not that much that divides people.” Sometimes a cliché just has to be looked at in a new light, presented with characters dramatically different from audience members and moments of magical fantasy, in order to become pertinent and moving.

Harvard is not the only institution in Cambridge that has clashed with city residents over the particulars of expanding its real estate holdings.At a meeting of the Cambridge Historical Commission last night, board members and Cambridge residents debated whether North Prospect Congregational Church would be given historical landmark status—a designation that may prevent Lesley University from expanding the structure to house an art library. The church, which is located near Porter Square, is one of only seven pre-Civil War structures still standing in the city.The university bought the building in 2006 to house the Art Institute of Boston, which it acquired in 1998.The Commission voted to designate the structure as a historical landmark according to the recommendations of a report commissioned 16 months ago. But William B. King, the chair of the commission, said that they did not fully adopt all of the report’s findings—which include strict bans on any changes to the outside facade of the building—because they were too “prescriptive and restrictive.”The tentative plans to adapt the building for use by Lesley involve lowering the structure to ground level, removing the steeple, and transporting it to the opposite side of the lot on which it currently stands. In addition, one three-story structure and another five-story building would be constructed on the lot and a glass “art commons” would be placed in the center of the newly-created quadrangle.Representatives of Lesley University, including its president, Joseph B. Moore, said that they agreed that the church should be granted the status, but maintained that the proposed alterations should not be written off due to the building’s designation as a landmark.Many of the Cambridge residents who spoke against the proposition said that they were opposed to the school’s suggested alterations to the church, not the plan to bring the Art Institute of Boston to Cambridge. “We are absolutely supporting AIB coming to our neighborhood, but we want it to be an addition,” said Dr. Peter Lang, Harvard Medical School professor and longtime resident of the Porter Square neighborhood. “We don’t want it to destroy some of the things that we have.”Andrea Wilder, another Cantebridgian, characterized the proposed renovations as akin to “punching out a person’s front teeth.”“The term being used is restoration,” she said. “The restoration of a building includes respect for its social and physical context, and that is not evident here.”—Staff writer Sofia E.

The Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA) will make $300 million in fixed-interest loans available to families with undergraduate and graduate students residing in or attending school in Massachusetts, Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 announced on Wednesday.MEFA, a non-profit, self-financed state authority, will provide loans for the 2009-2010 academic year for undergraduate students at a fixed 7.75 percent interest rate. The graduate student loans interest rate is higher at 8.89 percent.According to MEFA spokeswoman Jessica L. Belt, the authority was unable to provide student loans last year because it could not raise enough money until September of 2008, when it was too late for the 2008-2009 academic year.Belt said that while MEFA had previously provided other funding resources in addition to parent loans, current economic conditions forced the authority to focus only on sustaining its traditional loans program.“With everything that’s happened in the capital market, we’re now just working on funding our fixed interest loans,” she said.The loans are not widely used by Harvard undergraduates, in part because of the relatively large financial aid packages provided by the University, according to Harvard Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue, who estimates that 30 undergraduate families took out loans through MEFA the last time they were offered.According to Belt, applications for MEFA loans from students attending Mass. schools have increased significantly over the past five years.“It’s great news,” Donahue said. “We’ve had parents borrowing from [MEFA] for many years, and obviously it’s been a difficult year for loans nationwide.”She added that since Harvard does not incorporate student and parent loans into its overall financial aid packages, the University does not take a cut of the loans. “We are so fortunate to have the program we do, where parents don’t have to borrow as much as they did in the past,” Donahue said.MEFA undergraduate loans had a fixed interest rate of 6.39 percent for the 2007-2008 academic year.—Staff writer Shan Wang can be reached at wang38@fas.harvard.edu.

University President Drew G. Faust and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Allan M. Brandt fielded student questions and concerns at a town hall-style meeting in the Dudley House common room yesterday.  During the meeting sponsored by the Graduate Student Council, the administrators spoke about the past, present, and future of graduate education.“This is a critical time for the graduate school, the University, how we think about education, and the role it plays in our society and the larger global economy and world,” Brandt said. Faust acknowledged, however, that the expected 30 percent decrease in the University’s endowment would be difficult to accommodate and that administrators have not established a time frame for working toward fulfilling certain commitments, such as financial assistance for parents.“We’re just trying to figure out how to sustain the core parts of our programs,” Faust said. “I’m delighted that we were able to increase stipends for graduate students, but we’re going to have to monitor very closely the changes we have to make.”In addition, Faust touched upon the University’s year-old Common Space Initiative, which aims to increase the number of venues where both formal and informal gatherings can take place.She noted that the group had been meeting regularly and had come up with “many very exciting ideas,” such as revamping the Holyoke Center, which she said is “very underused.”She also assured the GSAS student audience that Dudley House could only be positively affected by the initiative.Brandt also spoke about the need to improve the culture of mentoring within GSAS. “We really need to talk as a community of students about how to get what you need,” Brandt said, adding that students who come to Harvard to pursue graduate studies should not feel obligated to work towards a Ph.D. GSAS students said they were glad to have the chance to hear from Faust directly and are optimistic about GSAS’s relationship with University-level administrators.“I think it was a very good opportunity and is the beginning of a bigger conversation between GSAS and President Faust,” said Zsuzsanna B. Magyar, a second-year regional studies in East Asia student.  Faust briefly touched upon the presence of international students at GSAS, emphasizing that the “value of international students at GSAS to GSAS and the University is enormous.”—Staff writer Marianna N.

Last weekend, two thousand speakers from 50 countries, including Kyrgyzstan and Singapore, gathered at Harvard for the 2009 American Comparative Literature Association annual meeting, “Global Languages, Local Cultures.”And while such an international crowd may not be foreign to Harvard, it was once to this field.Comparative literature was for decades a conservative discipline that focused mostly on Western Europe, but it has recently expanded to include the study of world literatures. Conference co-organizer and Visiting Professor David N. Damrosch, who knows twelve languages, ranging from Nahuatl to Egyptian Hieroglyphics, has been at the vanguard of the transformation, and has served as the general editor of the six-volume Longman Anthology of World Literature.This fall, he will leave Columbia, where he as taught for almost three decades, to take over as chair of Harvard’s Department of Literature and Comparative Literature. He says he hopes to encourage concentrators to study world languages and to increase the offerings of world literature courses to undergraduates.Comparative Literature and University Professor Stephen Owen praised his new colleague.“He brings expertise and fame, and he’s a very good teacher,” Owen said, adding that Damrosch holds a leadership position in the field of world literature at a time when it is flourishing.‘A DECISIVE NEW JUNCTURE’Damrosch says he decided to move to Harvard, where he joins his English professor brother Leo Damrosch, in part because of “the exciting opportunity to help remake the department at a decisive new juncture.” According to Owen, the graduate program in comparative literature merged with the undergraduate concentration in literature three years ago, while he was still chair. Prior to the merger, the two programs had no tenure-track faculty of their own. In the fall, there will be four.As Damrosch assumes control, he says he hopes to expose Harvard students to world literature from the beginning of their undergraduate education, through courses such as Literature 10 and 11, the two-semester introduction to world literature he taught this year, and will continue to teach in 2009-2010.Pelin Kivrak ’11, a literature concentrator in Damrosch’s class this semester, praised the professor’s teaching style. “He acts out every part of the plays he teaches,” she says. “When we read British texts, he speaks with a British accent, and with Russian texts, a Russian accent.” Kivrak, a native of Turkey, said that she hopes that more classes in world literatures will be offered to undergraduates.In addition to teaching, Damrosch says he plans to listen to the concerns of students and faculty as he considers possible changes in the undergraduate curriculum. “Right now the emphasis has been more on literary theory, not so much on language study,” he says. Damrosch says he believes theory can be studied together with works of literature, and favors more departmental encouragement of language study.Damrosch says he loves to find unexpected connections between distant writers. The Buried Book: The Loss and Rediscovery of the Great Epic of Gilgamesh, a recent publication that was his first book for a popular audience, called on the examination of cultural linkages as a response to the Iraq War. “I was impatient with the loose talk about a clash of civilizations,” he says. “I show that if you go back far enough, there is one civilization.”Damrosch has also written frequently about teaching world literature. “I have a very evangelical feeling about this literature,” he says. “It is a creative area to work in, where rhetoric hits the road.”­—Staff writer Alex McLeese can be reached at amcleese@fas.harvard.edu.

U.S. Secretary of Energy and Nobel laureate Steven Chu will be Harvard’s headline speaker at Commencement this year, University officials announced yesterday morning.
The announcement—which highlighted Chu’s role in promoting renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions both as a policymaker and as an academic—reinforced Harvard’s recent focus on sustainability and other environmental issues, which were identified as some of University President Drew G. Faust’s top commitments.
“Steven Chu is a brilliant scientist and an eloquent exponent of thoughtful, creative approaches to meeting the challenge of global climate change,” Faust said, adding that it would be a “pleasure” to hear Chu speak at the afternoon exercises on June 4.
The news was met with mixed reactions from the student body, as House e-mail lists erupted with conflicting opinions. Defenders of the speaker selection chastised those who grumbled that other universities managed to snag high-profile public figures, such as Hillary Clinton, who will be speaking at New York University’s Commencement.
“Compared to Commencement speakers in the past, the name recognition just isn’t there,” said Jumin Lee, a senior in Leverett House who described the pick as “kind of underwhelming.”
Lee and many students pointed to past Commencement notables, such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 2007.  
“Energy is an important issue,” Lee said, “but I feel that a lot of students just aren’t excited about it.”
The lack of celebrity status aside, many students and faculty warmly welcomed the prospect of Chu’s appearance on campus this June.
“Choosing our current Energy Secretary as our Commencement speaker is a testament of how important energy and climate issues are in society today,” said Daniel P. Schrag, an environmental science and engineering professor who also heads the University’s Center for the Environment. “I think hearing his perspective on how [the nation’s] efforts are progressing will be fantastically important.”
The soft-spoken member of President Barack Obama’s team graduated from the University of Rochester in 1970 before receiving a Ph.D from the University of California at Berkeley. Chu would later go on to head the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and serve as a professor at Stanford and Berkeley.
Chu, who won a Nobel prize in 1997 for his work on cooling atoms with laser lights, comes from a family of academic high achievers—both parents attended M.I.T. and his brothers hold degrees from Princeton and Harvard Law School.
But an Ivy League education seemed to elude the once self-described academic black sheep of the family. Citing his “relatively lackluster A-average” grades as a reason for the rejection letters received in his senior year of high school, Chu later wrote, “I consoled myself that I would be an anonymous student, out of the shadow of my illustrious family.”
Several decades and a Nobel prize later, Chu will finally receive a Harvard degree—all Commencement speakers who are chosen by a four-member and tight-lipped committee recieve an honorary degree  from the University at the ceremony.

When staff worker Richard E. Kaufman learned in February that he would be eligible for the early retirement incentive package, he knew that it would be too early for him to leave­—especially for the financial instability that awaited him outside of Harvard.But with the 45-day period for accepting or rejecting the package drawing to a close on Monday, many staff workers in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences said in interviews with The Crimson that they have been buckling under the mounting pressure of possible layoffs­.“You really don’t know what will happen because there isn’t likely to be any warning,” said Kaufman, a librarian in the psychology department. “If you don’t accept the package, you could be laid off—and the uncertainty tends to prod one towards taking what is possible.”FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has firmly dismissed the notion that the administration has pinpointed specific individuals for layoffs—but he conceded that job cuts are “certainly on the table.”Despite administrative silence, staff circles have been simmering with anxious talk about the possibility of future layoffs, which many of them view as inevitable.In February meetings with department administrators, FAS finance officials said the University would review budgets after the 45-day window and then consider the need for layoffs with the Office of the General Counsel and human resources officials.According to a guidebook for FAS departments that details planning procedures for next fiscal year’s budget, the administration expects to notify all laid-off employees within a short time frame in the spring. Departments will devise provisional lists of workers who might be laid off, and final decisions will be made by top FAS administrators. Employees will be given at least 60 days notice.“They can’t make [budget deficits] go away by cutting out cookies and coffees. They do need to get rid of personnel,” said Beth Baiter, a 69-year-old staff assistant at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. “Given my age, I would probably be one of the early ones to be laid off.”Despite the stated voluntary nature of the retirement program, Kaufman said he would have felt subtly threatened by the possibility of layoffs had he not accepted the package.“I have more years ahead of me to work,” Kaufman said. “Obviously, I wouldn’t choose to retire if I knew my position is secure.”Baiter and Kaufman handed in their forms indicating their decisions to take the package—their last day of work will be June 30. Baiter hopes to tutor, and Kaufman—eight years shy of retirement age and much too young to stop working, he said—wants to work at a gourmet food or liquor store.“I’m not going to be a bag lady yet,” Baiter said. “I absolutely am not going to bleed until the train hits me.”All the staff workers have been approaching the decision-making process of the past month and a half in light of their respective financial statuses, legal dependents, and work situations—and the sums of these factors are leading to different decisions.Otto F. Coontz—assistant to the resident dean in Adams House—said he feels secure enough about his job to risk turning down early retirement. Houses are not feeling as much pressure to downsize as academic departments, and Coontz said that if he worked in an office with more staff and felt more expendable, the package would have presented a greater dilemma.“I don’t think anyone will be feeling very confident saying that in this environment, but...I simply and honestly can’t imagine how the office would function,” Coontz said.But fears of the harsh economic reality of joblessness have convinced some staffers that they may be better off taking their chances and staying where they are—for now, at least.“I’m not taking it,” said an eligible administrator in the department of molecular and cellular biology. “I would really love to retire—would really, really love to retire—but it’s not a good time to retire in this financial atmosphere.”The individual, who requested not to be named for fear that speaking out would increase the chance of a layoff, is clinging to the hope that the University will discover that cutting her job would not generate the greatest savings—two-thirds of her salary is paid by grants earmarked for certain types of research.“I think about it every day. I think, oh God, why don’t I just take the early retirement? But the fact is I can’t take $3000 a month for the rest of my life,” the individual said. “I have to take a chance.”In February, the University announced its early retirement incentive program for staffers at least 55 years of age and who have worked at Harvard for a minimum of 10 years as of June 30 of this year. Those who take the package will receive one-time pension benefits equal to their annual salaries, reduced by any severance packages they had been entitled to receive.—Staff writer Esther I.

Harvard is considering reducing capital spending and projected new debt issuance by as much as 50 percent due to recent endowment losses, according to a credit rating report issued by Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday.The University has already slowed construction of its Allston expansion, which combined with other campus capital projects would have cost roughly $1 billion a year in capital spending and required Harvard to issue $3 billion in new debt over the next three to four years, according to the report.Planned spending could revert to higher levels “if fundraising results or the economy’s growth is substantially better than expected,” said Moody’s, which expressed confidence in the University’s liquidity position and reaffirmed its top “Aaa” rating. Moody’s does not anticipate that Harvard’s long-term competitiveness will be affected by the capital reductions since peer institutions also taking hits.Harvard spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to comment on the spending reductions further than what was stated in the report. But he noted that a letter to the community from University President Drew G. Faust dated Feb. 18 stated that the Harvard was conducting an “intensive, ongoing review” of capital projects in order to avoid “overextending the University’s near-term financial commitments,” while keeping in mind academic and community commitments.Harvard’s endowment, totaling nearly $37 billion last June, lost at least an estimated 22 percent of its value in the four months ending Oct. 31, according University officials. Harvard planners have said they are anticipating a 30 percent decline for the full fiscal year, although some reports have speculated that losses could be even greater.While Harvard has “robust credit strengths” and maintains a $2 billion line of credit from a consortium of banks, Moody’s said the University’s liquidity position has suffered recently due to endowment losses and stress in the debt and swap markets. In December and January, Harvard completed $2.5 billion in bond sales to guarantee cash flexibility and refinance risky variable rate debt.According to the report, disruptions in the tax-exempt variable rate debt markets last fall “increased the perceived risk that Harvard could experience a failed remarketing of its debt.” While no such failure occurred, the disruptions hampered the University’s liquidity position by forcing it to keep cash on hand to meet possible calls on its variable rate and commercial debt obligations.Harvard is reported to have also invested heavily in interest rate swaps, a type of derivative that allowed the University to control for possible increases in interest rates on its debt. But instead of rising, the report said rates fell “rapidly,” forcing Harvard to meet large collateral requirements.The report added that since the decline came in the fair value of the portfolio, or the amount that Harvard would gain by terminating the swaps (or lose, in the case of a negative value), the liquidity drain could be reversed if rates rise again in the future. As of October, the University would have had to pay $571 million to terminate its interest rate swap portfolio, according to a December report from Standard & Poor’s rating services.The report also cited concerns that the University would be forced to use its cash reserves to meet certain capital calls, such as those from private equity and venture capital clients, that have traditionally been funded using returns from the University’s other private holdings. While the University had over $11 billion in staggered commitments to such firms through 2018 at the end of the last fiscal year, the report said that even under extreme circumstances, no more than half of this would be called in the next year, and that the University’s substantial but less liquid investments could also be used as a source of cash over the few years.Regardless of these concerns, the report said that Harvard’s current liquidity position has significantly improved and should remain healthy, despite possible strains from “self-liquidity debt, swap collateral posting, endowment spending requirements, private investment capital calls, and the general operating needs of the University.”According to the report, the University’s policies require it to be able to produce approximately $1.1 billion in cash on a weekly basis. As of Feb. 28, the University held over $5 billion in easily convertible assets, such as money market funds and Treasuries that exclude funds on-loan or pledged as collateral. Harvard also estimates that more than $9 billion of its general investment pool could be liquidated within a year, providing additional cash reserves.—Staff writer Peter F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and the Boston Redevelopment Authority launched the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund on Monday, which will provide $500,000 in grants over the next five years for community improvement proposals submitted by neighborhood non-profit groups.The Fund, which aims to foster neighborhood improvement, cultural enrichment, and educational programs in Allston, is part of the Allston Science Complex Cooperation Agreement. The agreement, signed in April of last year, stipulated that Harvard provide $25 million worth of community benefits to the neighborhood in order to proceed with construction of the complex. Kevin A. McCluskey ’76, Harvard’s director of community relations for Boston, said that the University looks forward to adding “this very positive element of our relationship to the work that we do with the neighborhood and the city.” He said he hopes the Fund will “seed some very good ideas” while strengthening existing community projects. According to Michael F. Glavin, the BRA’s deputy director for institutional development, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino appointed a seven-member advisory committee to review and recommend proposals for BRA approval. The committee, which includes three members of the Harvard Allston Task Force, will be accepting grant proposals for the upcoming year through April 30. “The mayor wanted to have other faces, other names, and other perspectives,” Glavin said, explaining why the fund is not simply governed by the Task Force.The program aims to distribute $100,000 each year for the next five years in grants ranging in size from $100 to $25,000. Unused money from each year will be remain in the Fund for distribution in subsequent years.“I’m hoping the partnership fund will reach down into levels where people don’t have that much organization, but still provide valuable services to the community and are in need of some funding help,” said Paul Berkeley, a member of both the committee and Task Force. The Fund’s inauguration may help to reassure community members that Harvard is following through on neighborhood obligations attached to the Science Complex project, despite Harvard’s announcement in February that it would be slowing construction of the complex due to the unprecedented decline in the school’s endowment.But Jake Carman, founder of the Allston Brighton Neighborhood Assembly, which aims to support low-income and working class interests in Allston, emphasized that his group is “opposed to community benefits as an appeasement and a replacement of having direct neighborhood participation [in the planning process].” Glavin said he is open to the idea of petitioning Harvard to extend funding beyond the current five-year period, depending on whether the program is “responding well [to] local needs.”—Staff writer Vidya B.

Wednesday, April 1, commonly known as April Fools Day, is a phenomenon to which even the illustrious (and sometimes all-too-serious) Harvard is not immune.  FlyBy has chosen some of the most prominent campus pranks this year to highlight, with details after the jump.
THE MOST CONFUSING JOKE was an email addressed to Weld residents from "Yard Ops." The e-mail claimed that a cockroach infestation had sprung up in Weld, and that budget cuts would force Yard Ops--as opposed to a legit extermination service--to handle the situation. The kicker? Residents were told that they should "please remove any used kitchen equipment, snack foods, dirty laundry, or other potential insect attractors from [their] room." Namely, staples of any college room had become an instant no-no. Or so some residents thought.
"I was pissed off for about 20 minutes before I realized it was April 1st," said Brian P. Eggert '12, an inhabitant of Weld. Some others indicated that the email was sent from what appeared to be a legitimate address, making the joke more believable than it might otherwise be.
But Jeremy Patashnik '12 said he was not fooled. "[The e-mail] made a reference to "'you have to clear out your dirty laundry from your room,'" the astute lad noted. "I figured a serious maintenance request would not ask that."
Yard Ops could not be reached for comment, so the actual source of the e-mail remains a mystery.
MANKIW MAKES A FUNNY: Ec10 czar Gregory Mankiw also got in spirit of April Fools, posting a fake entry on his personal blog. People would have to pay to read his online musings, he said, citing the economic downturn. Oh, and apparently the professor who served proudly under the Republican Bush administration is also joining his more liberal colleagues from Harvard Ec in DC on the Obama team.
JOVIAL GMAIL: And finally, Gmail (not a Harvard affiliated entity, but a crucial part of student life nonetheless)  attempted an April Fools joke that left us all unimpressed. For those of you who didn't notice the bright red link at the upper right hand corner of your inbox, Gmail created a page for a new "Autopilot" feature that would create automated replies to receive email based on the user's own personal writing style. FlyBy is disappointed by the relative obviousness of the joke. Better luck next year.

Flybyblog has one prediction for next year: student groups on campus will proliferate--this, judging by the fact that the Class of 2013 currently has six functioning(ish) Facebook groups. Since those 13ers just can’t choose, Flyby sees it as our duty to help the Class of 2013 choose the one, true, official Class of 2013 group. Here are our four favorites ranked in order from If-you-join-this-group-your-a-newb to very-respectable-Facebook-showing.
Group 4 
Creator: Wayne Crosby
1 member
Description: “ HOLY BATMAN!
Awesomest (sic) group EVER!! PICS & INTRODUCTIONS of ALL the NEW
FRESHMEN students! Class of 2013! Come see!”
There’s one picture. Is that you Wayne??
Enough said.
Group 3
Creator: Glen Maganzini
54 Members
Who is Glen?
“I'm a senior from Wakefield Massachusetts planning on going to
Northeastern next year. In addition to there not being any other
Harvard 2013 groups at the time, I felt that some really really
intelligent kids (Harvard applicants) would search for such a group;
this potential demand made me create it, a process that took less than
two minutes out of my day. Since then I've received quite a few
private messages on Facebook from people asking me if I am going to
Harvard. I don't blame them -- it would make sense since I'm the
creator of the group. I do end up explaining the paradox every time.
It gives me a laugh,” he told Flybyblog.
Hmm, okay.
Group 2
32 Members
Creators: Andrew Crowder Douglas, Andreas Weber
Claim to be the original group
Flyby was intrigued by these international creators and decided to
conduct a little interview:
Flyby: You're from Germany, right? Do you think being an international
student will hurt your chances of winning the battle of the facebook
groups?
Doug: I think that being bilingual and well-versed in world cultures
can assist me in many areas, but when people see the two Facebook
groups, I'm certain they're going to flood to the one with more
people.
(Touché, Doug).
Flyby: So on Facebook it says you're married, is that serious?
Doug: My friend from the UK and I toured Niagara Falls and Canada. We
had such a good time, that we decided to become Facebook spouses.
Yeah.  We're weird like that.
(Girls of 2013—sounds like this one is still available!!)
Flyby:  Name one thing you love about Harvard.
Doug: Harvard contains some of the most fascinating people one will
ever meet.  I look forward to becoming immersed in Harvard's rich and
diverse culture.
Aw, shucks, flyby’s ego granted Doug’s group points for this response.
Group 1- OUR CHOICE FOR THE CLASS OF 2013 FACEBOOK BLOG
600 members
Creator: Colin Zwaziger
Also claims originality.
In the midst of trying to judge the quality of membership in each
group,  Flyby threw up a little wall-post asking members to tell us
why their group should win the Battle of the 2013 Facebook Groups as
well as what they love about Harvard, in exchange for eternal blog
glory
Adam Butensky said his group was the best for one simple reason:
“Tt was the first one, started by about 50 of us who were accepted
last spring but took a gap year. [Flybyblog thinks gap year kids are
cool] …Why we love Harvard... I saw a Harvard shirt in Israel at this
touristy shop, nothing Yale or Penn or anything. It's got the name
recognition that makes people's mouths just go wide open if they
happen to ask where you're going. And it's more than just a name, it's
got the sh*t to back it up.”
Well put Butensky, well put.
So Flyby was about ready to award this group our official kiss of
approval when we decided to take one last look at the wall and saw
this:
“i guess harvard is an alright school it was just my backup”
Not cool. 93% of applicants now hate you.

In response to the encroaching reality of adult life, the class of 2009 will be letting loose tonight with a “When I Grow Up” party that promises to answer all the questions of the anxious senior heart -- or conjure up shattered dreams.
Not sure what to wear? Why, whatever the professional you of 2020 would, of course. Still no dice? With some help from the Pussycat Dolls, we’ve compiled some general aspirations held by Harvard grads and five-year-olds alike, along with the respective role models/potential wardrobe solutions. 
Tips after the jump!
“When I grow up,
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies…”
ROLE MODEL: Paris Hilton. Duh. You don’t even need to do anything. This one’s perfect for that small yet obscenely wealthy percentage of Harvard students who can simply use their parents to jump start their success.
“When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies…”
ROLE MODEL: The Pope. He drives his own glass-encased vehicle, sick real estate, is constantly on the road, and has 1.131 billion followers…what more could you ask for? Bonuses include a cool hat and infallibility. Warning: you may lose some Catholic friends over this one.
“When I grow up
Be on TV
People know me
Be on magazines…”
ROLE MODEL: Members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. That’s right. What better way to plaster yourself all over national media than bigamy and über-vintage outfits? And with costumes like these, you’ll be instantly recognizable.
“When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick
When I step out on the scene…”
ROLE MODEL: Drew Gilpin Faust. Seriously. This lady commands serious respect regardless of where she chooses to “step out.”
How to get this look: head to Goodwill, purchase pantsuit, change, go to party. That’s it. No makeup or bling necessary. Optional: shoulder padding.
