After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students looking forward to running and lifting their way into shape this summer will not be doing so at the Malkin Athletic Center. Staffers at the athletic department have hinted that the MAC will be closed this summer due to budget cuts.  The MAC is the primary undergraduate exercise facility, offering everything from treadmills and Stairmasters to salsa lessons and spinning classes. But, while it will be sad to lose these resources, this particular budget cut is understandable and will allow students to take advantage of ample other recreational opportunities in Cambridge.
Given the university’s fiscal shortfall, it needs to be constantly seeking ways to cut the budget while preserving vital programs. At a point when core academic facets such as faculty hiring are being sacrificed, it seems reasonable to limit features more tangential to the academic experience. Indoor athletic facilities during the summer certainly fit this description. The ready availability of Stairmasters and treadmills was undoubtedly not the first thing on students’ minds when they decided to come to Harvard. Their temporary loss may be lamented as an inconvenience, but it will not harm the caliber of their education. 
Additionally, given that the city of Cambridge has plenty of other recreation options for students in the summer, the MAC seems like an appropriate place to cut. Cambridge has a host of public athletic facilities open for use around Harvard, boasting 84 public parks and playgrounds.  These include basketball courts outside of Mather House, tennis courts outside of Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School, and softball fields in the Cambridge Common. With a little curiosity and investigation, students can find and take advantage of these opportunities.
Indeed, we hope that students here in the summer might use the closure of the MAC as an opportunity to go outside and see more of Cambridge and Boston. Summer is a rare, welcome gap of time in which exploration off familiar paths is possible. It seems a waste of this opportunity to seclude oneself in a building with other Harvard students during free time. During winter, students have no choice other than to batten down the hatches and stay indoors at all times. Summer is a season to be outside and now, perhaps, to become better acquainted with the Cambridge community. It may seem unimaginable to stay at Harvard without usual Harvard lifestyle resources, but it is possible and could lead to a more enlightening, enjoyable summer.

Ever since U.S. health officials declared a public health emergency over the H1N1 strain of the influenza virus—commonly known as “swine flu”—worry has arguably spread faster than the disease itself. Some countries have imposed bans on travel to Mexico, and some international flights carrying passengers who complained of flu symptoms have even made emergency landings at the nearby major cities. Yet, in the midst of the panic surrounding the outbreak of the disease, which has appeared in several probable cases on the campus of the School of Dental Health, Harvard’s reaction to swine flu addresses what is surely a major concern in a calm and rational way.
While it is a fundamentally good thing that the Harvard community has been notified via e-mail of the disease’s potential to spread and of its presence on campus, perhaps the best thing about Harvard’s reaction is its commitment to informing the community instead of inspiring panic. We certainly echo the recommendations of University Health Services officials who have suggested taking small precautions such as frequent hand-washing, but we hope that students do not allow a fear of contracting this new flu strain to inhibit their daily routines and activities. In cases like this one, caution—rather than chaos—is key. 
Of course, we hope that the swine flu “pandemic” never materializes and that the current situation does not worsen. Current information suggests that the outbreak may be less severe than was originally suspected and that swine flu might not, after all, be nearly as deadly as the infamous 1918 flu strain. Still, caution and vigilance are more than warranted. We hope that UHS will be ready to confront the problem if and as it develops any further. All steps should be taken to ensure that Harvard is prepared to handle a major outbreak on campus, even if an outbreak never actually appears. 
But Harvard should not merely allocate its medical resources to protect its own people. Honoring a long-standing commitment to serve the community as a whole, the university should consider dedicating resources to fighting a swine flu outbreak, especially among the elderly and the poor, two demographics which may be underresourced and in greater danger for having the disease. Thus far, the university’s rational internal reaction to the swine flu scare has been perfectly appropriate. By reaching out beyond Harvard’s walls, if the situation warrants it, Harvard’s response could become even more of a paragon.

A germinating meme among what is left of the American right at the conclusion of President Obama’s first 100 days in office is that the new president has been uniquely polarizing. The seeds for this notion were planted by a Pew Research Center poll released Apr. 2 attesting to an unprecedented 61 percentage-point gap between the levels of approval of the president expressed by Democrats and Republicans. Since then, a veritable rogues’ gallery of former Bush administration staffers, including former Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson, and former Deputy Assistant to the President Peter Wehner—an ironic crowd to be maligning others for partisanship—have been on the attack.
In an Apr. 8 column for the Wall Street Journal, Rove claimed that “no president in the past 40 years has done more to polarize America so much, so quickly.” This indictment was seconded by Gerson, who declared Obama to be more polarizing than Presidents Nixon, Reagan, or Bush in an Apr. 8 column for the Washington Post, and Wehner, who, in a blog post Apr. 6 for Commentary Magazine, asked, “Is a record-setting divide among Democrats and Republicans at such an early point in his presidency really the change we were told we could believe in?”
These once and current partisans would have made a convincing case that the current commander-in-chief is a Clintonesque sower of partisan discord had their contentions not neglected certain inconvenient details.
The most egregious of these omissions is the fact that today’s GOP is but a phantom of its former self. According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Apr. 26, while 35 percent of Americans identify themselves as Democratic and 38 percent as independent, only 21 percent of Americans currently identify themselves as Republican. Like some grotesque Russian-nested doll, the Republican coalition has been losing constituencies one by one, so that now only the most virulently reactionary elements of its base remain.
It implies something entirely different to garner support from an opposition that consists of a significant and diverse sliver of the electorate than one that consists of nothing more than its uncompromising base. Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and Bush failed to win over the most hardline Democrats, so one cannot fault Obama for failing to penetrate the bowels of the Republican camp. 
However, those whom he did have a chance of convincing—the Republican moderates—have largely abandoned their party to become independents or Democrats. Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter is the latest of these converts. In order to gauge the breadth of Obama’s popularity fairly, therefore, one must turn to his support among independents. 
According to Pew, Obama’s national approval and approval among independents is virtually identical, with 59 percent approving nationally and 57 percent of independents concurring.
Granted, Obama has hardly been more bipartisan than the average president despite his pledge to be so. His courtship of congressional Republicans has been largely symbolic, failing to adopt any of their ideas despite spending more time with House Republicans than President Bush did. His stimulus bill garnered only three GOP votes out of 219 in both houses of Congress, and that was more than his budget received.
However, Obama appointed three Republicans to his cabinet, pursued centrist policies in Iraq and Afghanistan that Senator John McCain has praised, included in his stimulus package one of the largest tax cuts in history despite calls from the left for fewer tax cuts and more spending, and resisted calls for nationalizing major banks. To claim that Obama has been the most partisan president ever, therefore, is both disingenuous and more than a little partisan itself.

Israel’s David Duke, Avigdor Lieberman, took center stage last month as foreign minister. Americans—on the whole—rejected Duke’s rank racism. But Lieberman was frighteningly successful in February’s national election, indicating a bigoted viewpoint in Israeli society that chooses Jewish supremacy rather than equal rights for all citizens.
U.S. special envoy George Mitchell was apt to come face to face with the recalcitrance and bigotry of the new Israeli government during his trip to the region. But will he denounce the headlong plunge into extremism and rejectionism pursued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his foreign minister?  Unfortunately, this is unlikely, though the day may be drawing nearer.
Lieberman has long espoused the notion that Israel’s Palestinian citizens are a demographic and strategic threat. We are the ones who remained on our land when roughly 700,000 Palestinians were expelled by the new state of Israel in 1948. We comprise nearly 20 percent of Israel’s population. Yet Lieberman—an immigrant from Moldova—would have us stripped of our second-class citizenship in a land swap with a future Palestinian state—a state whose very existence Netanyahu has yet to accept.
Imagine the uproar if an American politician called for loyalty tests and the expelling of the country’s remaining indigenous population. This is precisely what Lieberman has proposed. Will he really be welcomed in Washington at the White House or State Department?
However, Lieberman’s views are not controversial among the major parties and political elites in Israel. The Obama administration will make a crucial error in judgment if it thinks of the rise of Lieberman and his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, as a new development. Focusing on Lieberman distracts attention from the real issues to one disagreeable politician. Such logic wrongly suggests that, without Lieberman, peace between Palestinians and Israelis would be easier to achieve.
Lieberman only exacerbates an already existing problem, and he cannot be easily dismissed as a marginal case of excess or as an abnormality of the Israeli political system. Among Yisrael Beiteinu’s elected members of the Knesset are a former ambassador to the U.S. and a former senior commander in the police force. Theirs is not simply a right-wing political insurgency, but an outlook deeply rooted in Israeli politics.
Dismayingly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, Labor’s Ehud Barak rejected calls from some of his senior party members not to join a coalition that included Lieberman. Worse, prior to the vote, he sought to outflank Lieberman in belligerence by claiming that Lieberman talks the talk but does not walk the walk. “Lieberman,” he said, “is strong in words and not in deeds.  I do not know how many times, if ever, he held a rifle and shot anyone.” Barak believes that he—and not Lieberman—is the tough leader able to make life miserable for Palestinians.
The question of Palestinian citizenship in a Jewish state started long before Lieberman used incitement against Palestinian citizens to gain votes. Many prominent Israeli academics and politicians have expressed support for ideas repugnant to Americans. Barak claimed in June 2002 that Arab citizens will serve as the “spear point” of the Palestinian struggle and that this would require changes in the rules of the “democratic game” to guarantee the “Jewishness” of the state. He also expressed support for a land swap that would strip Palestinians inside Israel of their citizenship because it makes “demographic sense.”
Tzipi Livni, another so-called centrist, holds similar discriminatory views. On January 23, 2002, she urged members of the Knesset to reject an equal-protection clause according to which equality is the right of every citizen in the state regardless of his or her nationality, religion, or views. The proposed bill was rejected, and formal equality remains outside the Israeli book of laws. Livni also supported bills in the Knesset that would grant settlement and allocation of land for Jews only, such as the one submitted by MK Rabbi Haim Druckman on February 18, 2002. Finally, she repeatedly argued that Israel will never be the national home for its Palestinian citizens and averred that, if they have a collective aspiration, they should look for it elsewhere. 
MK Effie Eitam of the National Religious Party is another proponent of expulsion. He derided Palestinian citizens of Israel as a “fifth column,” “ticking bomb,” and “cancer.” Nevertheless, these views did not prevent the former general from being appointed as a minister of national infrastructure in 2002 and of housing from 2003 to 2004.
Such bigoted vitriol typically ends political careers in the U.S. George Allen’s bid for the U.S. Senate derailed when he referred to one of his opponent’s campaign workers, an American of Indian descent, as a “macaca,” or monkey. In the 2006 and 2008 U.S. congressional and presidential elections, American voters signaled a desire to transcend a history of Jim Crow discrimination. In Israel, however, the country is on an opposite track with careers buoyed by bigotry directed at the country’s Palestinian minority.

Relax. Odds are you won’t die of swine flu, and neither will anyone you know. Ongoing research on the virus suggests that it isn’t very deadly, and ordinary Americans who have not recently been to Mexico have little reason to be concerned.
Yet, if you’ve only been watching news networks like CNN for the past week, you’d think we’re all doomed. It’s not just the media: The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert to the second-highest level last week. Even my mother, a practicing doctor, called me on Monday to tell me to avoid riding the subway. While it’s clear we’ll survive the swine flu, who knows if we can handle the mass hysteria?
Panic, of course, has risks of its own. One big danger is wasted time, which can cost businesses revenue if workers stay home out of fear. Waste can also come in the form of purchasing unnecessary antiviral drugs or face masks, which are basically ineffective against something as small as a virus, anyway (though they may keep out globs of mucus where viruses tend to be concentrated).
Another concern about panic is declining sales in industries associated with the outbreak. For instance, U.S. hog markets have been hurt recently as consumers scared about the flu are avoiding pig products. This behavior is irrational: Unlike mad cow disease, which involves prions that can stick around after death, viruses need their host to be alive and cannot survive cooking, so there’s no danger in eating cooked meat of a pig that was sick before it died.  The Feds have tried to explain this to Americans and have even started calling the virus “H1N1” (after the scientific name for its strain) to protect industry, but the damage has already been done.
Fears of a pandemic can also create enmity between once-cooperative countries over who was to blame for the contagion, which could touch off a powder keg in sensitive areas like the Taiwan Strait or Palestine. In addition, the blame for the disease may take on an ethnic or racial component. In the U.S., swine flu has already encouraged latent racism against Latinos to bubble to the surface.  For organizations where keeping calm is a daily struggle, like prisons, pandemic panic can lead to riots or even murders. 
I’m not advocating that information about potential epidemics be hidden in order to keep the public docile. We should still warn the population at large and try to quarantine diseases before they spread, because, even though swine flu will likely turn out to be mild, our species remains highly vulnerable to rapidly communicable diseases. 
In fact, we likely face a bigger threat from viruses today than ever before.  For nearly all of human history, the fastest way to travel was by horseback, and contagious diseases could only spread from town to town by piggybacking on migratory animals or unlucky travelers. Despite these difficulties, the Black Death in Europe was still able to kill between 30 and 60 percent of Europe’s population. The forward march of science around the globe has helped keep disease at bay through vaccinations, good hygiene, and quarantines, but international air travel gives upstart pathogens hoping to hit the big time an advantage their ancestors never had. Should the Black Death return, it could crisscross the globe in a matter of hours.
With stakes this high, no agency, from the WHO to Harvard’s administration, wants to understate a hazard or withhold any information that could potentially save lives. And, after the intelligence failure surrounding 9/11, there is added pressure to ensure that every threat, no matter how obscure, is identified and contained.
There is some prudence in this approach. Any warning system that only responded to true emergencies would clearly be too conservative. But media messages about a potential threat must be put in context, and authorities must take pains to be specific. 
For instance, a recent letter sent via email to the entire university from the provost and the director of University Health Services said there were two cases of the flu reported in Lowell, unnecessarily causing many students to worry that there was an outbreak in the undergraduate house, rather than the implied cases in Lowell, Mass. Similarly, the vice president mentioned at a news conference last week that he would advise his family to avoid going “anywhere in confined places now” like airplanes. His comments aren’t only unfairly damaging to the airline industry, but, given his position in the government, they also suggest that he has inside information about the flu’s dangers that aren’t being shared with the general public. Similarly, mainstream media outlets should resist the temptation to sensationalize coverage with terms like “vicious virus” (used by CNN).
In a true pandemic situation, the state of panic would be unavoidable and probably much more severe. But, for swine flu, we truly have nothing to fear but fear itself.

Responding to fears that Harvard may reinstate its licensing contract with Russell Athletic—a sportswear company accused by labor groups of mistreating its workers—Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement brought a former garment worker to campus last Thursday in order to speak about the company’s violations of worker rights.Harvard ended its licensing agreement with Russell Athletics last December, as the company faced allegations that it shut down a Honduran factory because of workers’ attempts to unionize. Yet Rick Calixto, director of the Harvard University Trademark Program, wrote in an e-mail in February that Harvard would consider renewing its contract with Russell if the company followed recommendations of the Fair Labor Association (FLA), a global workers’ rights group of which Harvard is a member. Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09, a SLAM member, said that SLAM is concerned that the investigation leading to the FLA’s recommendations were flawed. In response, SLAM brought Salma Mirza, a member of the national staff of the United Students Against Sweatshops, and Mirna Chavarría Lopez, a 37-year-old former worker in Russell’s Honduran factory, to campus in order to talk to administrators.  “We’re very concerned that Harvard said they were going to wait for the FLA recommendations,” Mirza said. “The FLA has really mishandled this case in terms of their investigation.”Mirza and Chavarría Lopez have sent a letter to Harvard President Drew G. Faust, and they spoke to students outside the Science Center early in the afternoon on Thursday, although they have been unable to set up a meeting with Calixto.Following this talk with students, Chavarría Lopez sat down to discuss her experience as a worker in the Honduras factory. As Mirza translated, Chavarría Lopez described working eleven hour days for minimum wage, without benefits. She said that when the workers tried to form a union, their factory was closed and they were blacklisted.“We want our jobs back, and if the company doesn’t give our jobs back then they have stolen from us,” Chavarría Lopez said. She also criticized the FLA investigation, saying that the group failed to take testimonies from factory workers or from the Honduran Ministry of Labor.Both Mirza and Chavarría Lopez called for Harvard to wait for the recommendations from the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC)—another labor rights group—before it decided whether or not to renew its contract with Russell. According to Mirza, the WRC investigation was more exhaustive and its recommendations would likely be more stringent. “We’re not trying to condemn Harvard,” Mirza said. “We’re just trying to get them to listen to these facts.”—Staff writer Evan T. R. Rosenman can be reached at erosenm@fas.harvard.edu.

Lowell House’s newly molded Russian bells rang in their inaugural performance of Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture—a piece that explicitly called for Russian bells—on Sunday.The Danilov bells—which preceded the current set—were donated to Harvard by an American industrialist Charles R. Crane in 1930. They narrowly escaped the fate of most other Russian bells that were, at the time, being destroyed by Stalin’s regime. They were returned in 2008 to their original home, the Danilov Monastery in Moscow, after many years of negotiations, in exchange for the new set of 17 bells that now hang in Lowell’s Bell Tower.Channing Yu ’93, who has been conducting the performance for the last few years, turned to the audience in a crowded Lowell Dining Hall to introduce the piece. “This is an annual tradition dating back to the first decade of the House,” Yu said. “[But] this is a very special year, as it will be the first performance with our new bells.”The show—complete with hydrogen balloons to simulate cannons—brought together students, faculty, and Cambridge residents alike.Noam D. Elkies, professor of Mathematics, was among the makeshift orchestra, playing the electric keyboard and blowing into a kazoo.The orchestra relocated to the dining hall from the courtyard, which usually houses the performance, due to weather conditions. But the bells still made an appearance in the performance when Yu cued the bell ringers—more properly called the Klappermeisters—with a call from his cell phone.Elif I. Batuman ’99, a freelance writer and former Lowell resident, wrote an extended article in the April 27 issue of The New Yorker about the storied history of Lowell’s bells.Like many undergraduates at Harvard, Batuman said she was not very interested in the bells during her time as a student. “I just had no idea what was up with them other than that they were rung every Sunday,” she said. “I remember it being early in the morning, although now I realize it was at 1:00 in the afternoon.”According to Batuman, the bells are a symbol of spirituality as well as political freedom in Russia.“A lot of people were crying,” she said of the moment when the bells were returned to the Danilov Monastery. “They all feel like they are some part of their history that they were alienated from for a long time.”Nonetheless, Harvard was at first reluctant to return the bells that had been as much a part of the school’s history.“The house tradition isn’t actually depleted by the bells going back; it’s enriched,” said Batuman. “These bells have even more of a weird story than the previous ones did.”—Staff writer Susie Y. Kim can be reached at yedenkim@fas.harvard.edu.

Students crowded into Science Center C on Friday night, but instead of picking up syllabi, they grabbed free condoms and cupcakes frosted with images of vaginas.The lecture hall was packed for the fifth annual Female Orgasm Seminar, organized by the Radcliffe Union of Students and led by speaker and sex educator Sari Locker.Locker mainly focused on the importance of knowing one’s own sexuality rather than relying on what the media, pornography, or others say should feel pleasurable.“It takes three things to know your own sexuality,” Locker said. “It takes knowing yourself, it takes knowing others, and it takes knowing about sex.”Despite this serious-sounding message, Locker’s presentation was interactive and interspersed with sexual jokes and innuendoes, drawing plenty of laughs from the attentive audience.Early in the seminar, Locker called to the front three female volunteers, who she positioned to model the female anatomy. Two of the women represented the labia while one represented the clitoris.“Now how does an orgasm happen?” Locker asked the audience. She answered by patting the head of the girl playing the clitoris, who then jumped up and down to symbolize an orgasm.Locker advised women seeking orgasms to explore their body and to masturbate.Event organizer Eva B. Rosenberg ’10 said she was pleased with the turnout and the audience participation, but was disappointed with Locker’s focus on heterosexual sex and the lack of information for gay, transgender, and other queer individuals.“I thought it was a little heteronormative,” Rosenberg said. Locker did bring up gender identity, advising students who felt uncomfortable with their gender to explore while in college.Attendees of both genders were well represented in the audience, and Locker directly addressed the men as well, giving them advice on how to last longer during sex.“I think it’s good to get a dialogue going about sex on campus,” Daniel F. Selgrade ’12 said after the seminar. “Women don’t get what they want.”Locker also mentioned the importance of safe sex. With a volunteer holding a rubber penis prop, Locker gave a descriptive step-by-step demonstration of how to use a condom.As she displayed rubber penises of various sizes, Locker took the opportunity to discuss penis size, arguing that size is less important for good sex than the compatibility of the partners.“There are millions of men who are incredible lovers at any size, so I don’t want men having size anxiety,” Locker said.After her presentation, RUS gave away vibrators, sex books, and sex toys in a raffle, and Locker answered audience questions submitted on anonymous cards.“I hope everyone took away the important message that they should be looking inward to discover what you enjoy,” Locker said after the seminar.—Staff writer Danielle J.

Eight new cases of influenza linked to the Harvard Dental School have been deemed by local and state health officials “probable” infections of H1N1 “swine flu,” according to an announcement made by the Boston Public Health Commission at a press conference Friday afternoon. The announcement raises the total number of possible cases in the Boston area to nine, adding to the original diagnosis of a Dental School student that was announced last week. Of those nine, two cases tested as Type A influenza accompanied by “acute febrile respiratory illness,” meeting the criteria for swine flu diagnosis published by the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Final confirmation of a swine flu diagnosis is pending additional test results from the CDC, said David S. Rosenthal ’59, director of Harvard University Health Services. Rosenthal also noted that no additional cases had been identified over the weekend, a finding that seems to indicate that the possible epidemic may have been contained.Following recommendations from the Public Health Commission, the Dental School—along with the Harvard Dental Center—will remain closed until May 6, when the transmissibility period for the current patients will have passed.“This is a unique situation because the [infected] students see patients and, in this group of nine students, there was contact with patients,” said Barbara Ferrer, the executive director of the Commission. Ferrer added that her office also recommended that the Harvard Medical School suspend its clinical rotations until May 6 due to its close relationship with the Dental School.Rosenthal said that the Medical School has complied with Ferrer’s recommendations on clinical rotations. At the press conference, Anita Barry, director of the Infectious Disease Bureau at the Boston Public Health Commission, said she believed that only a small number of patients could have been exposed to the infected students, explaining that the hygienic masks used during treatment as well as the low-volume caseloads typical of dental rotations would have minimized risk. The Dental School has faced a precautionary closure since last Thursday, after one of the School’s students was diagnosed with a case of influenza symptomatically similar to previously observed swine flu cases. According to Ferrer, that student had been in close contact with an unidentified individual not living in Boston who fell ill after recent travel to Mexico. Both Ferrer and Rosenthal stated that all nine of the diagnosed students are making full recoveries from within their homes, where they have been asked to remain until their period of transmissibility passes. Additionally, Rosenthal emphasized that despite the low overall severity of the recent case-cluster, the Harvard health community will remain vigilant. “We just have to continue good hygiene and advise people who are sick to contact their doctor,” he reiterated. Rosenthal said that a reevaluation of the schools’ closures will be made on Wednesday after further clinical review. —Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.

Administrators in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences did little to allay students’ fears about impending cuts at yesterday’s town hall meeting hosted by the Undergraduate Council. The meeting came two weeks after FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced that a broad restructuring would be necessary to close a $220 million deficit over the next two years.
Though the meeting was billed as an open forum for students to “join the dialogue” on the College’s future plans, Smith, joined only by College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, revealed no specifics about changes to come—except that students should expect further notice about the remaining $143 million of cost-cutting measures come May 11. University President Drew G. Faust, who was slated to complete the night’s trifecta of administrators, pulled out due to illness, according to UC president Andrea R. Flores ’10.
Throughout the night, Smith and Hammonds declined to provide details, stating repeatedly that it is too soon to expect answers from the administration.
“It may seem like an eternity [of waiting] for you guys,” Smith said. “But this organization is so big, and getting it to move fast takes a bit of effort.”
The May 11 announcement is expected to outline imminent budget reductions in a carefully presented manner.
“We’ve reached a point where we need to talk about the big ideas,” Hammonds said from her perch atop the table to roughly 50 students in attendance, emphasizing that the six working groups Smith charged with proposing possible cuts would strive to be as transparent as possible.
And Hammonds said figuring out how to achieve this level of transparency would be the “very first thing” on the agenda.
But it remains unclear what form restructuring efforts would take.
“We’ve been looking for efficiencies at this point,” Smith said, adding in response to a question that eliminating or merging academic departments has not yet been discussed.
In response to a series of questions about ongoing cuts—such as the 25 percent reduction in House budgets—Smith and Hammonds pointed to various instances where the administration had elected to keep certain commitments.
Smith insisted that the reductions in faculty hiring still left Harvard in an “aggressive” position relative to its peers and that FAS will go ahead with 19 junior faculty searches next year.
But with no senior faculty searches on the horizon, this figure—about half the average over the last 10 years—marks a dramatic shift from what Faust termed in a recent interview as the Faculty’s “very fast” growth.
“I think we’ve done a fairly good job of making as minimal an impact on those areas as possible,” Smith said.
A significant number of the night’s questions from members of the Student Labor Action Movement raised concerns that staff would bear the brunt of budget cuts in the form of mass layoffs, but both Smith and Hammonds rejected the notion that the upper echelons at Harvard were not shouldering a fair part of the burden. Smith refused to admit that cuts were targeted at “low-pay workers,” insisting that savings from administrators pay cuts would be negligible relative to the gaping deficit.
Hammonds also said that she hopes the Ad Board Review Committee’s report—which she received March 6—will be presented before the Faculty in the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Women’s Center was transformed into a boutique clothing store yesterday for the Center’s annual “Naked Ladies Brunch.”Hundreds of articles of clothing were swapped at the brunch, where women could bring in their used clothing and receive new items in exchange. After the event, the Center donated the leftover clothing to the Big Brother Big Sister Foundation in Boston. Every year, the Women’s Center donates the remaining clothing to a different charity, according to Susan B. Marine, director of the Women’s Center.“We wanted to do something where we could do a public service contribution,” she said.Although the event was called the “Naked Ladies Brunch,” no women were completely naked yesterday. However, many stripped down in the makeshift dressing room to try on new tops and dresses. Attendees also nibbled on fruit salad, bagels, and eggs cooked by Marine and other Women’s Center staffers as they browsed through the piles of clothing.The clothing selection was diverse, ranging from conventional jeans, tops, and shoes to more unusual wares, like bras and even a long ballroom gown. Some attendees were impressed with the quality of the available merchandise, much of it bearing brand names such as Chinese Laundry, J. Crew, and American Eagle.“I found a pair of Hollister capris that fit me perfectly that would be upwards of $100 in the store,” Anne E. P. Stone ’10 said.The main organizer of this year’s event, Gena M. Haugen ’09, said the brunch was open only to the Harvard community, a restriction that Chava E. Kenny ’12 said she favors.Kenny said that she has always wanted to do a clothing swap, and she felt more comfortable knowing most of the used clothing was from fellow students.The brunch is one of the Women’s Center’s most popular events every year, according to Marine. “It gives you a chance to bring in all of your stuff before you move out so you don’t have to pack it,” Olga Tkachenko ’12 said.—Staff writer Danielle J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A piece of a railing fell off a Claverly Hall balcony on Saturday night, injuring two students sitting on the front steps below.
According to  witnesses, pieces of dirt and debris began falling from Claverly Hall around 8:30 p.m., and a piece of railing from the top balcony fell off moments later.
Baris C. Ercal ’10 and Parker A. Lawrence ’12 were struck by the broken railing after it ricocheted off the ground. The students were sitting on the front steps of Claverly, watching a celebration outside the Harvard Lampoon.
Ercal said he remembers hearing a crash and seeing a metal rod lying on the ground before realizing that he was bleeding and had been injured.
“I stepped on my left foot and felt pain,” said Ercal, who sat down after realizing there was a one-inch gash in his left knee. “I was really worried that it would be much more serious.”
A few minutes after the incident, an ambulance arrived and took Ercal to Mount Auburn Hospital. Ercal said he was released around 11:30 p.m.
Lawrence—who estimated the metal railing to be about two feet long and three inches wide—said he was also hit by the object. Besides a bruise on his right calf, Lawrence said he was fine and left the scene after speaking with Harvard University Police Department officers.
No one else at the scene of the incident was injured.
Immediately afterward, police roped off the area to prevent anyone from entering or exiting the building, and directed residents to the back entrance.
A HUPD officer at the scene said he did not know how long the building would be taped off, but that a building inspector was coming.
Ercal said he had heard that a girl in Claverly had been standing and leaning on the balcony, possibly causing it to break off.
“Some girl ran down immediately after it happened, apologizing,” said Ercal.
According to Lawrence, the impact of the object’s fall left a crack on the stone steps.
“I think it would have killed me if it hit me directly,” said Lawrence.
Melissa Y. Caminneci ’09 said she was walking past Claverly moments before the balcony broke off.
She said that she heard a trickling sound from above, followed by a larger cracking noise moments later. 
“It’s a really unfortunate coincidence that someone just happened to be sitting there when it fell,” said Caminneci.
Sharon L. Howell, Resident Dean of Adams House, said that the building manager was inspecting Claverly Hall yesterday.

Talk about making a statement at exactly the right time. In its last home dual race before the crucial Eastern Sprints next weekend, the No. 5 men’s heavyweight varsity eight thrashed No. 7 Northeastern Saturday morning, dominating its Charles River rival with a 10.5 second victory.“Northeastern’s obviously a very strong opponent, and we anticipated that,” said captain and second-varsity six seat Teddy Schreck. “I think today was really just a good opportunity for us to go out there and exercise the things we worked on all week.”The Crimson completed the sweep of the Huskies in the varsity and freshman contests, winning all five of its races for the second weekend in a row. It was a thorough performance reminiscent of last year’s showdown with Northeastern, albeit with one important difference.Back then, the Harvard varsity eight managed to grab the lead over the Huskies with 20 strokes to go and held on for a 0.7 second margin of victory. This year’s marquee matchup of two of the nation’s top-ranked teams was far less dramatic—not that the Crimson was complaining.“We do know that they like to come out and have an opportunity to take us off, and last year they did race us down to the line,” Schreck said. “This year we knew they were going to do the same thing…we were lucky enough to come out and have the race we did.”Harvard’s undefeated first varsity boat staved off a quick start by the Huskies and pulled away in the opening minutes to a two-seat lead at the 250 meter mark. By the time the crews reached the Massachusetts Avenue Bridge, the Crimson had a clear advantage and used the remaining time to expand its lead, finishing the 2,000-meter race in 6:10.7, while the Huskies came in at 6:21.2.“It was a pretty stiff headwind today,” said varsity eight stroke Simon Gawlik. “Coming off the line, Northeastern hung with us for a good bit, but we were able to get up on them and continuously increase our margin. It seemed like we handled the conditions a little bit better.”The convincing win, the 12th in a row over Northeastern in the varsity eight, gave Harvard the 21st Charlie Smith Cup and its sixth win of the season.The Harvard second and third varsity eight got in on the fun as well, finishing 1-2 in the second varsity race. The Crimson 2V got off to a great start and extended its advantage throughout the race, while the third varsity eight trailed the Huskies most of the race.The crew then found an extra gear as it passed the MIT boathouse, pulling even with Northeastern and eventually ahead into the second spot. The Crimson 2V finished in 6:17.4 for its second win of the year, while the 3V followed at 6:24.5 and Northeastern clocked in at 6:26.8.“It’s nice to have that sort of depth,” Schreck said. “The third varsity boat was fortunate enough to come out and top their JV, and I think that shows how deep our program actually is. It’s good to see that all the work from top to bottom is really paying off.”The EARC top-ranked freshman eight maintained its perfect record by pulling away from Dartmouth in the second half of its race, while both boats finished ahead of Northeastern. Harvard completed the course in 6:20.5, while Dartmouth finished in 6:26.9 and Northeastern clocked in at 6:34.0.In the varsity four race, both Crimson boats finished ahead of the Husky crew. Harvard’s A entry held at least a boat-length lead the entire way, while the second Crimson four tussled with Northeastern early on before coming out on top in the final 750 meters.Harvard’s second freshman eight, ranked second in the EARC, defeated seventh-ranked Boston University in the day’s first race, coming out strong and finding open water the rest of the way in a 22-second win.Now the Crimson must gear up for the EARC Sprints May 10 in Worcester, Mass, one of its biggest races of the season.“To have the results we did today was pretty encouraging,” Schreck said. “We know there is some speed to pick up, and there is also some momentum to carry us into Sprints, which is a race we put a lot of attention on throughout the year.”“We’re not ranked first going into Eastern Sprints,” Gawlik added. “There’s a lot of crews up there with us, and we’re not going to underestimate anybody.”—Staff writer Dennis J.

They may be pretty in pink, but the Radcliffe women’s lightweight and heavyweight crews proved their power Saturday morning on the Charles River at the annual Beanpot Championships. With every rower sporting a pink shirt to support breast cancer awareness, both teams swept their local rivals to finish the cup season and prepare for the upcoming national championships.On the heavyweight team, all four varsity boats pulled out solid wins, with each crew beating its competition by over 11 seconds to keep possession of the Beanpot trophy and team banner for the third consecutive year. In the last home race of the season, the No. 16 varsity eight started the day off, jumping to an early lead against Northeastern, Boston University, Columbia, Boston College and MIT. The boats would finish in that order, with Radcliffe claiming an 11.5-second lead over second place Northeastern, easily winning the Rowlands Cup for the 11th straight year.“I think it was a really good race for all of the boats,” said senior Esther Lofgren, who rowed four-seat in the varsity eight. “Even though the conditions were rough again, we really had a strong start and were able to build off of it. There are still things we are working on, but for us seniors this was our last race on the Charles for Radcliffe and it was a good race to end on going into Eastern Sprints.”The second varsity eight crushed its competition, crossing the finish line 15 seconds before second-place BU. In the fours events, the Radcliffe A four placed first with a time of 7:58, while the B and C fours took first and second in the next race. The only loss for Radcliffe came in the novice eight event, where the crew came in second place, four seconds behind Columbia. Radcliffe’s lightweight team had similar success on the Charles Saturday, soundly beating MIT in the varsity and second varsity events to claim the first-ever Linda Muri Cup.  The cup, named after Harvard freshman lightweight men’s coach Linda Murri, who herself has won three world championships and 18 national championships, honored the MIT and Harvard grad for her contribution to the rowing community. “I think she’s the most decorated lightweight rower in the US, so it’s an incredible honor to be racing for a cup after her name,” said Rebekah Kharrazi, senior captain of the Radcliffe lightweight team. “She’s been such a force in rowing, I think it’s definitely something that should have been awarded to her a long time ago.” Coming off a win against then-No. 2 Princeton, the No. 2 varsity eight took the lead from No. 7 MIT from the start, and continued to dominate the event as they passed the halfway mark. Beating MIT by a little over 21 seconds, Radcliffe cruised to the line with a time of 7:27.71. In the second varsity eight race Radcliffe crushed MIT by 37 seconds, while in the novice four event, Radcliffe placed second to the Boston College heavyweights. Columbia’s heavyweight four came in third.On Sunday, the Radcliffe lightweights took the opportunity to scrimmage against visiting lightweight crews from Western Ontario and Queens in Toronto. In remarkable fashion, the first eight again went on to win every race while the second varsity pulled off solid performances against the two Canadian crews. “I think the racing went really well,” Kharrazi said. “Again, [we’re] using every race opportunity to get faster.”With these wins, both the lightweight and heavyweight squads find themselves in a good position going into the EAWRC Sprints May 17.“Obviously it was a great day for the team, a big confidence boost to know that we are the fastest team on the Charles,” said heavyweight varsity eight coxswain Jill Carlson. “The size of the margins are really telling, so that’s another confidence booster for us going into Sprints.”—Staff writer Alex Sopko can be reached at sopko@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team ended its regular season on Saturday the way it started its campaign over two months ago in its 9-6 upset of then-No. 7 Duke—with a bang.
Coming back from a first-half deficit, the Crimson battled to a decisive 8-5 victory over Dartmouth on the Big Green’s Scully-Fahey Field. With the win, Harvard improved its record to 8-5, 3-3 Ivy, while moving Dartmouth’s standing back to 4-11, 1-5 Ivy.
But the victory was bittersweet. As the clock ticked down the seconds, sounding off a triumphant blare signaling a Crimson victory, it also marked what may be the end of several lacrosse careers.
But this did not stop Harvard’s senior class, which propelled its  team to one last Ivy League win.
“We had some great senior efforts,” tri-captain Nick Smith said. “That’s what really turned us around and got us the win.”
Smith led the team in ground balls, recording five on the day. Tri-captain Sam Slaughter upheld this defensive effort, while goalkeeper Joe Pike made 11 saves to bring his season total up to 110.
Tri-captain Max Motschwiller led offensively as he opened up scoring for the Crimson late in the first quarter. With Harvard suffering an early two-goal deficit, Motschwiller made his presence known at 1:36 with an unassisted score.
After another minute of play, the freshman power duo of Jeff Cohen and Terry White followed up on Motschwiller’s tally, as Cohen found the net off of a White ball with 0:31 remaining in the quarter.
Dartmouth fired back at the beginning of the second quarter, scoring two successive goals at 13:26 and 11:48. Cohen answered back at 7:54, again off a White assist, sending Harvard into the locker room down 4-3.
“The first half was not one of our better halves,” Motschwiller said. “But we hung in there and the second half was one of the best halves we’ve played all year.”
Luckily for the Crimson, that second-half surge was just enough to power them over the Big Green and end the regular season with a win. Harvard scored four consecutive, unanswered goals during the third period, leaving Dartmouth trailing 4-7 as the quarter-ending whistle blew.
Junior Travis Burr began the Crimson’s scoring spree, finding the net at 14:13 with a pass from Motschwiller. Cohen followed suit at 11:41 as he registered his third goal for the matchup at 11:41.
Sophomore Dean Gibbons finished up the third quarter for Harvard, recording two tallies at 9:18 and 1:23 with balls from freshman Kevin Vaughan and Burr, respectively.
This offensive effort sealed the Big Green’s fate. Dartmouth recorded one final goal at 6:47 that was quickly followed by an unassisted Motschwiller tally at 4:52, bringing up the final score of 8-5.
With the victory, the Crimson was able to finish its regular season with a three-game streak, while registering the program’s highest win total since 2002.
“Its been a really important year for the program,” said Smith. “We set the bar really high for years to come and I think all the seniors are proud to be leaving the legacy that we have left.”
The Crimson will find out tonight whether it will earn a bid into the NCAA tournament.—Staff writer Alexandra J. Mihalek can be reached at amihalek@fas.harvard.edu.

"This is the Concert for Dogs."
So began a set contribution to Arts First this afternoon from Charles F. Gillespie '10. Clad in a breezy plaid shirt with red suspenders, 'Chas' played the keyboard and alternated between tooting on a harmonica or belting out puzzling lyrics,  never once giving his poor diaphragm a break.
"Listen close, you might learn something or not," Gillespie said, before singing his opening "love" song, which involved something about an "X-rated picture."
The bearded crooner favored lyrics that—how shall we say it—evoked images of another world, perhaps one where the sober weight of existentialism meets the dainty lift of nonsensical observations.
"All my songs are dance songs, and you can dance to them like this," the wiry cross-country runner said, jabbing his arms into the air as he jiggled his fingers and awkwardly shifted in his seat. "We love you, Chas!" one fan yelled from the sides (without doing the dance, but that's a small matter).
No dogs were in attendance.

It has always been against Harvard policy to stand on fire escapes, but perhaps it’s time to amend the rule so that it’s illegal to stand underneath them, as well.
On Saturday evening, Baris C. Ercal ’10 and Parker A. Lawrence ’12 were sitting on the front steps of Claverly Hall and watching the 100th anniversary celebration at the Lampoon when pieces of dirt and rust started raining down from above. A few seconds later, a piece of a railing from the top balcony of Claverly came crashing down. The blunt object ricocheted off the ground, cracked the steps, and gashed Ercal in the leg and bruised Lawrence on the calf.
Though the students—who are both fine now—didn’t have a groundbreaking (no pun intended) revelation à la Isaac Newton, they did seem to gain a newfound appreciation for life and a deprecatory attitude towards Harvard’s historic (read: dilapidated) buildings.  
“It’s pretty terrifying,” said Lawrence. “I stared death in the face last night.”
And in true Lampoon fashion, the party raged on at the castle even as HUPD cars and ambulances swarmed the scene.
