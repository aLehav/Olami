“I’m an American because I eat spaghetti and Chinese because I eat chow mein.”
Forty years after the editors of “Aiiieeeee!” extracted and pushed back against this basic formula from early Asian-American literature, “Fresh Off the Boat” finds 11-year-old protagonist Eddie Huang eating the proverbial spaghetti.
Of course, he’s 11, and any 11-year-old in a new school is going to do—or eat—what he must to fit in. But as “Aiiieeeee!,” one of the first anthologies of Asian American literature, showed in 1974, there is a history behind the Asian American character that needs to be addressed; essentially, we divide our lives into the Asian and the American, slipping in and out of separate identities, unwilling or unable to reconcile the two. Even as the first television show featuring an Asian-American cast in 20 years, “Fresh Off the Boat” is rehashing an old, troubled story of duality, one characterized by the strange, mixed taste of offense and catharsis.
The real-life Eddie Huang, whose memoir inspired the new ABC sitcom, is ambivalent about the show’s material. Network television demands that it tiptoe the line between Chinese-American relatability and white sensibility (its heralding as “Asian-American” television disregards the fact that it cannot profess to speak to the Korean- or Japanese- or Indian- or Filipino-American experience) and it does so with a wide grin that often obscures the real anxiety of growing up yellow in a white society.
Take, for instance, Eddie’s parents: Taiwanese immigrants who move to Orlando to run a Western-themed family restaurant. Both speak perfectly fluent English, but the exaggerated accents they adopt make any pithy encouragements they give their three sons mere caricaturized fortune cookie slips. It doesn’t help that both fit into the character molds that every white teenager imagines for their Asian friend’s parents: the mother is rigid, obsessed with money, and insists that her children do not stand out, while the father is hapless, goofy, and constantly under the derision of his stern wife. It’s exceedingly recognizable and almost insultingly reductive.
Still, it’s a funny show—the pilot episode alone reckons with situations that all non-white viewers have encountered (“You speak English so well! Where are you from? No, where are you really from? How do you pronounce your name?”), but without any untangling of the pain of those moments. Rather, we see Eddie trading his Chinese noodles for Lunchables, and we never learn what his real name is after he cuts off his teacher’s introduction to call himself simply “Eddie.”
And in the most disturbing scene of the episode, a black student shoves Eddie in the cafeteria, then tells him, “Get used to it. You’re the one at the bottom now. It’s my turn, chink!” After Eddie beats him up, he earns the respect of his white classmates, supposedly ascending one rank in the racial hierarchy of his elementary school. What the hell?
I can’t profess to know what the remainder of the show will entail—perhaps Eddie will reconcile with his bully and they will go on to overthrow the blonde boys who relentlessly mocked Eddie’s homemade, Chinese lunches. Perhaps the simple fact that the show is being produced is a step in the right direction. But I can’t help but feel that it’s not a very big one—Eddie and his comically lovable, pudgy face already seem quite attached to the “white people food” packaged so conveniently in a small re-heatable box.

It seems Kanye West shares his wife’s penchant for breaking the internet. Just weeks ago, the Kardashian Klan’s latest addition unexpectedly collaborated with music deity Paul McCartney on “Only One,” an introspective, heavily auto-tuned tribute to his daughter North. Perplexing? Yes. Polarizing? Oh, yes. Quintessential Kanye? Absolutely. And now music’s most exciting odd couple has struck again, teaming up with Rihanna on “FourFiveSeconds,” the catchy, folk-tinged lead single from the reigning princess of pop’s yet-to-be-titled eighth studio album.
On this effort, Rihanna and West ruminate on their drunken mistakes of the previous night before acknowledging that they’ll continue to make said mistakes so long as their “kindness / Is taken for weakness.” Thematically, the song resembles those which display Rihanna’s flashes of youthful regret and vulnerability (“Russian Roulette,” “Stay”). Instrumentally, however, “FourFiveSeconds” marks a radical change to her signature sound. The singer eschews her trademark pulsing beats, Caribbean flourishes, and dessert-themed sexual innuendos for simple acoustic guitar and organ, creating a minimalist, almost campfire sing-a-along feel.
To her credit, Rihanna’s vocals have never sounded better. In sacrificing dance-happy production for a more organic arrangement, she allows her imperfect but refreshingly soulful voice to shine. The same can’t be said for the men, however—West and McCartney’s presences feel gratuitous. The rapper provides a verse and a half of lackluster rap-singing, while the former Beatle contributes nothing but steady guitar strumming. Disappointingly, their appearances seem to be based less on artistic integrity and more on generating buzz.
As the stripped-back, country and gospel-influenced ballad of a Barbadian party queen, a British rock icon, and America’s flashiest rapper, “FourFiveSeconds” is a conceptually baffling mélange of disparate sounds.. Despite the high-concept combination, however, Rihanna makes the song somehow work. West and McCartney may not help much, but the latter’s simple accompaniment does propel Rihanna’s rawness into the spotlight. While the single suggests a drastic shift in Rihanna’s aural aesthetic, it stands as a testament to her talent both for crafting a killer hook and for surprising her audience.

Of all the things you might expect the Central Intelligence Agency to tweet, Cyrillic would not be one of them. Yet, there it was, one January morning—a quote from Russian author Boris Pasternak, that when translated in English, says, “I wrote the novel so that it would be published and read, and that remains my only desire.”
Unlike the Twitter account of the United States Central Command, which was seized around the same time by hackers proclaiming allegiance to the Islamic State, this was no hack. Later tweets explained the cryptic message: “Our book program arranged to publish the 1st Russian-language edition of Pasternak’s Doctor #Zhivago – a book banned in the USSR.”
It had been long suspected that the CIA had played a role in smuggling Pasternak’s famous novel, rejected by the censors for its unrosy depiction of Soviet life. But the agency remained quiet until a Freedom of Information Act request revealed a trove of documents in April 2013, detailing its intimate, often bumbling, involvement in arranging the book’s publication and smuggling in the USSR.
Why go to all this trouble for a simple book? After all, it’s hard to imagine a single book propelling the American populace one way or the other, but then again, a Russian’s relationship with their literature was and remains much deeper than ours. Rare is the Russian who has not read Tolstoy’s weighty masterpieces, and common are nine year olds who would cite Dostoyevsky as their favorite author.
Books are “the most important and most powerful weapons in socialist culture,” in the words of Maxim Gorky.
“Only in Russia poetry is respected—it gets people killed. Is there anywhere else where poetry is so common a motive for murder?” the poet Osip Mandelstam said. In one of irony’s sick twists, he himself would die in a Siberian camp after writing an anti-Stalin poem.
It is said that Pasternak, who was most known for his poetry and not his novels within the USSR, was taken off an execution list by Stalin himself, who remarked: “Leave him. He’s a cloud dweller.”
Writers were one of the few holdouts of resistance to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which desperately wanted to inculcate partiinost, or “party mindedness,” and engender a new literature that extolled socialist virtues and glorified Soviet life.
The politburo wanted literature to be returned to its “traditional position as the handmaiden of politics,” as a CIA Soviet Staff study put it. “In the Soviet context…the artist is viewed as a ‘transmission belt,’ an ‘engineer of the human soul,’ whose function is to popularize official directives.”
Addressing the 1959 Writers’ Congress, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev put it this way: “Listen, dear friends. If there is anyone who discloses and lays bare deficiencies and vices…it is the party and the central committee.
To be a writer in the USSR, one had to be a member of the Soviet Union of Writers, which sought to supervise literature in that most soul-deadening and creativity-crushing  mechanism known to man: committees.
Naturally, this all made for very shitty literature. The people knew it, and the party knew it too.
“I’ve heard that Shakespeare didn’t belong to any union, and he didn’t write badly,” Vladimir Pomerantsev wrote in his influential 1953 essay decrying the artificiality of Soviet literature that inaugurated what is known as “The Thaw,” a brief respite from stiff censorship and control.
But there was a limit. When Pasternak handed over his manuscript to the Italian journalist Sergio d’Angelo for publication in Italy, he declared, “You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.”
Where some saw literary promise, the CIA saw valuable propaganda: publication of the novel would be a “possible blow to those who have insisted that Soviets enjoy internal freedom for expression and enjoyment of arts,” a cable to the agency’s director claimed.
The suppression, the cable went on to say, could galvanize public intellectuals like “Picasso[,] Roberson[,] Chaplin[,] Beauvoir[,] et al.” to denounce the USSR. And if they didn’t, “their refusals might…repudiate their fast and future pronouncements.” Win-win.
So, a Dutch publication house was found, the first run of 1,000 novels was rushed for distribution at the 1958 Brussels world’s fair, and a later 9,000 miniature Russian copies were designed and published. “The book was designed so that it could be easily concealed and fits inside a man’s suit or trouser pocket,” a 1959 CIA cable wrote.
The book was an international bestseller. Khrushchev and the communist party were furious—ever more so when Pasternak was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature, which he was forced to decline.
Fellow writers were pressured to repudiate him. Vladimir Semichastny, the future KGB leader who was then head of the Komsomol, the youth division of the communist party, declared Pasternak unworthy of comparison with even a pig, for “a pig never defiles the place where it eats, never defiles the place where it sleeps” in a speech that was said to have been written by Khrushchev himself.
Pasternak was mortified, and would succumb to lung cancer months later in 1960. His family later accepted the Nobel Prize on his behalf in 1989.
And that’s the story behind those 100 Cyrillic characters.

President Obama has received quite a bit of criticism recently over his handling of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the terrorist group that has taken over broad swathes of Syria and Iraq since the middle of last year. Most recently, he has seemingly compared the actions of ISIS to the Crusades. Further, a former national security official has declared that the President lacks a clear strategy for dealing with ISIS, though the administration earlier this month released its 2015 National Security Strategy.
Despite their frequency and volume, these criticisms are largely baseless. Though the Obama administration was slow in taking up the fight against ISIS, it has since correctly determined that that battle is a vital one for the future of a strategically important region. Moreover, the administration’s decision to make broad attempts at cautiously building a coalition is wise.
In particular, the administration has consistently pursued a strategy of lending air power and logistical aid in support of regional partners ranging from the Iraqi government and Kurdish forces to states like Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. As some analysts have pointed out, ensuring that local partners take the lead is the only way of winning a sustainable victory against ISIS and countering extremism in the region more generally. Only regional governments can forge the political solutions that will prevent the emergence of groups like ISIS in the future.
While the strategy of supporting regional partners has already seen success, it is not without flaws. One concern has been the reliance of the Iraqi government on Shiite militias—the same kind of sectarian favoritism that produced ISIS. Former CIA Director and commander of U.S. forces in Iraq David Petraeus has warned against “the United States being the air force for Shia militias.”
Another strategic issue is that of Syria. The United States has largely given up on trying to oust the regime of Bashar al-Assad, but needs to pursue a clearer strategy geared towards ending the humanitarian disaster of that country’s civil war. Moreover, the U.S. must have a clear idea of its preferred endgame regarding the presence of ISIS in Syria.
In short, though the Obama administration’s efforts to build coalitions are worthwhile, it cannot rely solely on vague goals. All these areas of murkiness mean that the U.S. must develop a more comprehensive strategic framework, one which clearly communicates its expectations to its allies and which backs up those expectations with tangible actions.
Beyond developing a coherent plan in Syria, the administration must not allow the Iraqi government to see U.S. support as endless and must incentivize Baghdad towards reigning in Shiite militias and continuing to build a stronger relationship with the Kurds.
The Obama administration is moving in the right direction in some of these areas. Perhaps most significantly, the President’s recent request for a three-year Congressional authorization for the campaign against ISIS could signal to American allies its unwillingness to provide endless military support in that region. On all fronts, however, the administration must take clearer stances and more decisive action. Anything less would risk further confusion in a region that has long needed less of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With singles-awareness day approaching, I’ve heard many of my friends and acquaintances express their concerns about spending the day “alone.” While I consider their preoccupation to be valid, I would like to offer a solution to their problem: change the holiday. I read somewhere that if one has an issue with something, there are three possible ways to react: accepting it, changing it, and ignoring it. While ignoring Valentine’s Day wouldn’t be a feasible alternative, and accepting it would mean that there is no inconvenience to begin with, I see some potential in changing the meaning of this particular holiday.
People have been celebrating Valentine’s Day for centuries, but not everyone knows that the story of the day comes from Saint Valentine of Rome—among other Valentines—and the clandestine marriages he performed. This man was literally imprisoned in the name of love, and even in his prison cell, he kept spreading love. As corny as it sounds, Valentine’s Day is my favorite holiday. I love love. There is something special about a day that encourages people to express their love to one another. It is a day of brave-hearted love declarations and overpriced tokens of appreciation to show your loved one how much you care about them.
I have to admit that being a part of all this comes as a cultural shock to me. As an international student, I knew about Valentine’s Day from chick flicks, and it looked like a lot of fun, but that was it. However, seeing how people torture themselves by considering this joyful celebration a reminder of their singleness instead of an encouragement to express affection, I thought I might initiate some cultural exchange. To reciprocate the cultural enrichment I have had while living in the States, I have a suggestion for Valentine’s Day. Instead of conceiving it as a day for lovers, celebrating exclusively couples, why not think about it as a Día del Amor y la Amistad—a day of love and of friendship?
I’ve grown up thinking of February 14th as a day that allows me to tell the people I love that I love them. And I am a very loving individual: I love my family, my friends, and my romantic interests. Sometimes even my acquaintances get heart-shaped candy, because I consider that day to be all about spreading positive energy. In some parts of Latin America, we view Valentine’s Day as a celebration of different types of love, not just romantic love. You can love others besides the person you are in a relationship with—it’s a different type of love, but that doesn’t mean that it is any less valid.
The way I see it, adopting this Valentine’s Day system could bring several benefits to the general public. First, it would allow people who are single to celebrate the fact that they have friends By making this holiday less exclusive, more people could rejoice in their friendships without taking anything away from those who decide to commemorate their romantic relationships—saying that it does would be the same as saying that your birthday is less yours because you share it with others.
Furthermore, it would increase both the holiday sales and the general feeling of well-being. That general feeling of well-being is extremely important, as are demonstrations of affection. In “The Four Loves,” C.S. Lewis wrote that affection was responsible for nine-tenths of whatever meaningful happiness there was in one’s life, and, on a more scientific note, a researcher at Arizona State University has found that demonstrations of affection have beneficial effects on human health, including lowering stress levels—a non-pharmaceutical stress reducer that Harvard could really use.
Thinking of Valentine’s Day as a Day of Love and Friendship wouldn’t equal adopting a different holiday or destroying a tradition. On the contrary, it would represent being more open and considerate to the people we spend time with, and would encourage us to demonstrate our affection to those we love, which is the whole point of Valentine’s Day in the first place. It’s not modifying the meaning of a holiday; it’s just broadening it so that it can be enjoyed by a greater number of people. No one needs to feel lonely on Valentine’s Day, and almost everyone is grateful after hearing that they are loved, in some way, by someone else. Spread love. It’s one of the few things that have worked well for us in Mexico, so why not give it a try?

My eyes are tearing up as I make my way up to the balcony seats in Sanders Theater. Not because I’m overly excited by the prospect of Harvard Thinks Big VI, but because it is cold as hell, and my eyes haven’t stopped watering since I stepped outside.


Sponsored by the College Events Board, Harvard Thinks Big is a TED-esque symposium during which several Harvard professors or students talk about a “big idea” for 10 minutes. I think I’m in the right place at the right time (Sanders on a Thursday at 7:50 p.m.)—there’s a big screen at the front with the logo—but there aren’t a ton of people here, like I was expecting. At least my fingers are beginning to thaw, and it’s entertaining if not a bit idiosyncratic that Ariana Grande is blasting from the speakers.
Soon, two student emcees take to the stage. They tell us that we are, in fact, here for the sixth Harvard Thinks Big—not Harvard Thinks Dirty. I let out a chuckle, put my phone on silent, and sit back, anticipating five scintillating, groundbreaking, mind-blowing big ideas (there were originally supposed to be seven speakers, but English professor Jamaica Kincaid has a sinus infection and music professor Ingrid Monson is helping Robin Thicke and Pharrell out with a lawsuit). For those too lame to brave the cold, here’s a condensed version of those five pearls of wisdom.
Interim Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Harry R. Lewis ’68: “Engineering and Harvard’s Future: A Few Big Ideas” 
Lewis talks about the role of practical learning at Harvard: where we’ve been, where we are, where we’re going. He shows us a few SEAS faculty members’ current projects, like  self-building robots and “material so slippery germs won’t stick to it.” The audience lets out a “woah” when a Robobee lands itself. It makes me feel more inadequate than ever.
Then, Lewis asserts that an applied science education is both formative and rewarding—you know, in equipping students for the real world. He shows us plans for the SEAS center in Allston, which looks like Northwest Labs on steroids. All of this makes it clear that applied science really is what we should be studying nowadays. Awesome that I declared English two months ago.
Applied Mathematics Professor Michael P. Brenner: “What is the difference between computer graphics and computer simulation?"
Unlike the other professors dressed in dark suits and shiny shoes, Brenner wears a cotton sweater and pants tucked into clunky snow boots, tongues both folded down. His casual approach becomes endearing early on, and he confides that he doesn’t really have a big idea; he just wants to complain to us about mathematical models for 10 minutes.
He shows us two videos: one of real fire, and one of animated fire, and the animation does look pretty legitimate. He explains that there’s a mathematical theory of fire, throws up some lengthy equations on the projector, and I mentally check out. Shortly afterwards he says, “I don’t know how long I’ve been going, but it feels like long enough,” thanks us, and leaves the stage.
SEAS lecturer Beth Altringer: “Making Entrepreneurship Ubiquitous” 
Altringer doesn’t follow the 10 minute guideline; instead, she spends 20 minutes talking about herself. At one point, she flashes a bunch of her journal entries; she also talks about IDEO, a design and innovation consulting firm, a lot, which to her credit is the coolest company ever. What Altringer explains is that she’s used her disparate interests to create a new model of business. Being able to flex different networks, she says, is the future of entrepreneurship. What I really learn is that boldface, capitalized type in pretty colors such as lime or cerulean make any presentation 10 times more professional.
Astronomy Professor David Charbonneau: "The Last Generation of Lonely Earthlings”
This is my favorite presentation by far, mostly because I really am curious about extraterrestrial life, even if I don’t openly admit that. Charbonneau, who’s famous for his research on exoplanets, begins as if he’s  really giving a presentation in 2045. He tells the audience that by May 2015, we will find a planet similar to our own. Yes, that’s right: Charbonneau claims that we’re just months away from finding Earth-like planets out there in the great expanse. A pretty hefty claim to be making, but I like it. This is the kind of big idea I was looking for.
Computer science professor David J. Malan: “CS50 Cult(ure)” 


Malan’s big idea is, basically, take CS50. I mean, his underlying idea is that we should be creating “class cultures,” and that this pedagogy is the key to future learning. As a result, the presentation feels like a condensed version of a shopping week class. At the very end, there’s a music video (high production value, of course) of students dancing and singing to a CS50 version of “Uptown Funk.” Enough said.

Following the historic announcement on Dec. 17 that diplomatic relations would be restored between the U.S. and Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, chief of mission of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba, recently sat down with Fifteen Minutes for a conversation about U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba.


Fifteen Minutes: Take me through a day in the life of the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba. What has been unique about your duties when compared to your previous diplomatic positions?
Jeffrey DeLaurentis: Sure, well because we don’t have formal diplomatic relations yet, I’m not the American Ambassador to Cuba. I’m chief of mission of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba, which is technically part of the Swiss Embassy. I have ambassadorial rank in the State Department because my prior position at the U.N. was a Senate-confirmed ambassadorial position. So that’s very important because one of the things we will be doing when we reestablish diplomatic relations down the line is that the president will be nominating a new American ambassador to Cuba. In terms of the day in the life [of an American diplomat to Cuba,] what’s probably different is of course we don’t have diplomatic relations with Cuba, so it’s a very unique set of circumstances, a very unique experience. We have geographical restrictions to the boundaries of the province of the City of Havana. My Cuban diplomatic counterparts in Washington have the same restrictions. It’s reciprocal. So we have to be a little more creative in the way we conduct our diplomacy. We don’t have access to the entire Cuban government. We are restricted to one
point of contact in the ministry, so the relationship with the government of Cuba is very unique. In most other countries, where we have embassies, where we have formal diplomatic relations, it’s a much broader, expansive relationship.
FM: Can you walk me through the process that led to December’s announcement that full diplomatic relations would be restored with Cuba? Was it something that was years in the making, or was it a relatively short development?
JD: Right, well when President Obama came into office, he said that one of the things he was interested in doing was reexamining our policy toward Cuba. He talked about how [the U.S. having] a policy that was put in place prior to when he was born would suggest that it required a look. So he took some steps in the first term of his administration in 2009 and again in 2011 with travel and remittances, relaxation of some of the ways Americans could engage with the Cuban people, [and] expanding the People to People programs. These kinds of things were part of his effort to reexamine the policy. And then of course the incarceration of Alan Gross, I think stopped that process. That needed to be resolved, and so negotiations began April/May of 2013 as he indicated in his December 17 speech.
FM: With the current state of Congress and some of the conflicts that we’ve seen, what is your outlook for the next two years? Will we see any congressional action that will rollback some of the laws passed during the Clinton years? Do you see Congress being able to move along with where the president is trying to go?
JD: I would probably leave it to members of Congress to explain what they think is going to happen. I would say that there hasn’t been a vote on Cuba in a very long time in Congress, so I think a number of the members of Congress will start to revisit the issue, look at it, and reach their own conclusions. Now we have seen some activity in the last few days on both sides of Congress with the introduction of new pieces of legislation but again, it would be difficult for me to speculate how successful they’ll be.
FM: What would you say to the human rights activists and dissidents that disapprove of where the U.S.’s policy toward Cuba has gone in the last couple of months?
JD: I would say that I respect and value their opinions. I frankly think that it’s a positive thing that there are different points of view with respect to what the president has done, but I believe that in the short term, medium term, and long term, what the president has done will help their efforts, not hurt it.
FM: Is there anything you can say about the fate of Guantanamo Bay? I know this is [a policy] that the president has said that he is committed to changing. Can he order executive action on it? Is it something that requires congressional action?
JD: The only thing I would say about Guantanamo is that it’s based upon a treaty and agreements between both countries. For it to change, both countries have to agree to that change. And on our side, there’s no interest in changing it.
FM: Cuba, with the exception of Venezuela, was really the last country in our hemisphere that the U.S. has had continued conflict with. Since enemies of the U.S. have been known to travel through Cuba and other countries that the U.S. is in conflict with, how will this affect the larger political landscape?
JD: The history of U.S-Cuban relations is a difficult and colorful one. In a way, for many years we’ve been family and foe at the same time. And certainly the President wanted to change that dynamic. He thought it was really important to extend a hand to the Cuban people and to focus on the Cuban people rather than on punishing the government. I think there are a growing number of areas where we’ll be able to cooperate. And even in the areas where we don’t cooperate, we’ll have a new opportunity to talk to them about these disagreements and hopefully influence their point of view.
FM: In addition to the historic announcement in December, can you point to one thing that you are still working on with Cuba that you would like to one day look back on and say that you helped make happen while in this post?
JD: The most important thing for me on a daily basis is to begin to prepare and position the Interest Section to become the first U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 55 years as we move forward with the process to negotiate the reestablishment of diplomatic relations. I think that’s, for me, going to be my most important mission on the ground in addition to continuing to promote the universal values that we hold dear.

Driving through the streets of Cambridge in an unmarked truck filled with gadgets ranging from Hershey’s chocolate spread to copper mesh, Matt J. Kreimeyer could very well be a secret agent. Given the fact that Matt has keys to Harvard’s dorms and an unfathomably vast knowledge of the intricacies of our campus, part of me genuinely believes he might be Harvard’s Dark Knight. And in some ways, he is.
Somewhere between James Bond and Paul Blart, Kreimeyer serves the needs of Harvard students every day. As the owner of Best Pest, a company his father, Rod, founded just over 30 years ago, Kreimeyer works tirelessly to fight off mice, roaches, bed bugs, and basically any other creature hypochondriacal students like myself worry about. “The only thing we don’t handle is wildlife,” Kreimeyer tells me. “Things like squirrels and raccoons.”
As for the aforementioned weaponry Kreimeyer carries around on the job, pest protection isn’t exactly what the cartoons make it out to be. “If you watch Tom and Jerry, you think 'Oh, let's put some cheese in there,’” Kreimeyer says, sympathizing with the average, dare I say ignorant, pest-infested Harvard stu- dent. But in reality, “mice like wet, greasy products,” he tells me, which explains the chocolate and peanut butter his technicians carry around.


In the so-called Harvard bubble, where students are fixated on startups and extracurricu- lars, sometimes, it’s hard to remember the way the world operates outside of these hallowed grounds. But speaking from personal experience, few things bring Harvard students back to earth like a mouse sighting. As Kreimeyer puts it, “it’s like having a stranger in your house.”
So, when Kreimeyer or one of his seven other technicians comes into a student’s room—big sense of humor, Boston accent, and mouse traps in tow—Harvard students are almost forced to (gasp!) show some humility.
And according to Kreimeyer, “Harvard students, as a whole, are very polite [and] very friendly” when Best Pest shows up.
“We feel like a big part of the community,” Kreimeyer explains. “We take a lot of pride in servicing Harvard.”
This pride shows in their work, as Richard Pollack, a Harvard professor and senior environmental public health officer who oversees Integrated Pest Management, can attest. “Best Pest, particularly Kreimeyer and his father, Rod, seem to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the structure of buildings,” he tells me. “They know what's in our walls better than our architects."
In short, “there’s a lot of institutional memory,” as Pollack puts it, that Kreimeyer gained through osmosis from following his father around on the job as a kid.


“When I was in high-school, it was just [my dad],” Kreimeyer remembers. “So I got to go on a lot of jobs with him... doing grunt work.” At the time, Kreimeyer tells me, he “had no desire to be in pest control.” But now, as the owner of Best Pest, Kreimeyer is doing what he loves.
“Everything’s new, you’re meeting a lot of interesting people, [and] here at Harvard you’re seeing a lot of interesting things—I’ve seen the original Moby Dick manuscript, which is something I'd’ve never seen in my entire life,” Kreimeyer says.
The benefits of working in pest control at Harvard don’t stop there. “What's nice about being a pest control guy is, for the most part, people are happy to see you,” Kreimeyer explains, as his bright blue eyes light up. "They're excited to see me ‘cause I'm gonna solve their problem.”

“I want you to feel this liver.”
Few ordinary students have appreciated the spongy qualities of a healthy liver on Dr. Oz’s TV show, but Elana P. Simon ’18 is anything but ordinary. Diagnosed at age 12 with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma, a rare form of cancer, she has since gone on to beat the disease and, later, conduct research pinpointing the genetic mutation responsible for the affliction. While Simon has been the subject of multiple media frenzies, she describes her time on Dr. Oz’s show as “the most absurd experience I’ve had because of this whole thing.”
Slight of frame, with shoulder-length brown hair falling onto her flannel shirt, Simon provides a polished and well-rehearsed summary of her experience as cancer survivor, research pioneer, and community leader. Though she says her title of “the teenage girl who cured her own cancer” is “a bit generous,” the real story is just as incredible.
Simon’s own cancer was caught in its early stages, and was removed before it could metastasize. Years later, in high school, after soliciting sample donations over YouTube, Simon worked with her surgeon’s team in her father’s lab to determine the genetic abnormality—dubbed a “chimera gene”—responsible for her cancer. The team published its findings in Science Magazine; Simon is listed as the first co-editor.
This paper instigated the first media frenzy in Simon’s life. She was the subject of articles in The Wall Street Journal and The New Yorker, and the guest on several TV talk shows. She was even asked for her autograph (but only once, she promises). More importantly, she learned that hospitals around the world were checking their own findings against the paper and confirming the presence of the chimera gene in their patients as well.
Simon remains humble about her fame. “I feel like I don’t take it all that seriously. It comes, it goes. It’s fun...I feel like it actually doesn’t amount to that much,” she says. In Simon’s mind, the most valuable part of the exposure was the ability to connect with incredible scientists from around the globe and to use the publicity to further research towards a cure.
Also, selfies with Bill Nye. “He was all about the selfies. He was going up to all the kids like: ‘Shall we take a selfie?’” Simon says.
If media attention is a series of peaks and troughs, it’s hard to deny that, at least at Harvard, Simon has reached a new peak. On Feb. 1, Simon introduced President Barack Obama at the launch of his Precision Medicine Initiative. Two days before the event, she received a call from her mother relaying a vague invitation to fly out to the White House. Amused by her celebrity status, Simon’s roommates filled their Snapchat stories with pictures of Simon protesting: “Mom, I can’t to go to the White House on Friday. I have class!”
Nonetheless, on Thursday, en route to a CS51 lecture, Simon’s phone rang with a call from the White House, requesting that she write a speech to introduce Obama. When Simon explained that she had class and then tickets to Hasty Pudding Theatrical’s Woman of the Year roast, the aide begged: “Can’t you just write it during lecture?” Brashly ignoring the oratory stylings of Professor Greg Morrisett, Simon did just that.
The next day, after chatting with the president, whom she had previously met at the White House Sci- ence Fair, Simon introduced him at the event and even received a Presidential hug (“He’s a pretty good hugger,” she says).
Simon managed to jet back to Cambridge just in time for dinner at Annenberg. Still outfitted in a dress and heels, she told curious friends that she had been “at a business attire event.”
The ruse didn’t last long. “My roommates had found all the pictures online and proceeded to make a lot of fun of me,” says Simon. Any hope of keeping a low profile was forever ruined when the White House took snippets from her previous speeches and penned an email in her name, sending it to all who had opted in to receive such missives from the Capitol. Even her ex-boyfriend received the email and texted her in confusion.
Although press coverage can make it sound as if cancer research is Simon’s entire life, she also harbors a longstanding love for the performing arts. Having appeared in two “really depressing German shows” last semester, she is performing in Öğk, an experimental production, this spring. She is also a member of the Harvard Radcliffe Modern Dance Company and is proficient in circus silks and aerial acrobatics.
Before college, Simon expressed concern that her work in cancer would force her into the field for life, and brand her as “Cancer Research Girl.” At Harvard, however, she primarily studies computer science, and has yet to decide if she wants to add working in a lab to her busy schedule.
Despite her exploration this year, Simon remains a public figure for the disease.
When she first Googled fibrola- mellar after diagnosis, she was met with sparse information, mostly emphasizing the low survival rate. Simon’s research and her family’s advocacy efforts (“Fibrolamellar has become sort of a pet project for my family,” she says) now offer more optimistic prospects for patients.
“A lot of people will reach out to me when they get diagnosed,” said Simon. “Cancer is something that’s just part of my life... so there’s a very good chance that I’ll spend my life trying to research it.”

John Huth, esteemed experimental particle physicist, member of the ATLAS Collaboration at the European Center for Nuclear Physics, and professor of Science of the Physical Universe 26: “Primitive Navigation,” has an office that’s really hard to find. After climbing three flights of stairs, walking down several long corridors, and making three rights and then a couple of lefts, I arrive at Huth’s office considerably winded. The noonday light streaming from his window casts a long shadow on the sun compass arranged at his desk. He stands and gives me a cheery handshake. “I got pretty lost on the way here,” I admit. “Maybe I should be taking your class.” He responds, laughing, that I probably should.
Fifteen Minutes: So, how did a dedicated particle physicist like you get mixed up in primitive navigation?
John Huth: Well, it was an accident. In 2003, I went kayaking off the beach by my house in Cape Cod. I didn’t have a map or compass, but I paid attention to the wind direction going out. It was a sunny day, but 30 minutes into the paddle, fog closed in. Somehow, I had the presence of mind to use the wind as a way of orienting myself and navigating back to the beach. The next day I was stopped by the harbor master, who asked me about two young women who had gone kayaking the day before recreationally, about a half a mile from my house. They had been out around the same time as me. They told their boyfriends they would be back in 10 minutes, but when 45 minutes passed a search party was sent out. A day later, they found the body of one woman, but not the other, who was presumed dead. They had gotten lost in the fog.
FM: That experience must have rattled you.
JH: It’s hard to describe survivor’s guilt. You ask, “Why me? Why did I survive and these women didn’t?” I got a little bit obsessed at that point with natural ways of finding my position. Eventually I found that I was doing something very similar to what other cultures had done, like the Polynesians and the Norse, memorizing star positions and using the wind as a natural compass. I built up a stockpile of tricks.
FM: Did you develop those tricks yourself or did you go back to history?
JH: Both. I would try things that I read the Polynesians did. Here’s a perfect example. [He points at the sun compass.] There’s a stick called a noman in the middle that casts a shadow, and the path of the shadow can help you orient yourself out at sea. So I have done orienteering races with a homemade sun compass, and it turns out I did pretty well.
FM: Have you ever had a bad experience with any of these ancient navigation tricks?
JH: They’re more reliable than a compass! They’re more intuitive. But one time I got a little turned around. I was on the Charles River and I thought I could navigate by the sun, but it was too high in the sky and I didn’t recognize where I was or which way the water was flowing. So I panicked, but then I looked at the reeds through the water, saw which way they were bending, and figured out which way the water was flowing. It’s like a puzzle. Every so often something is going to throw you, and then the game is to try and correct yourself.
FM: Today there are a plethora of apps, from Waze to Google Maps, to help people who are lost. What’s your pitch for primitive navigation?
JH: People who use nature to find their way are actually much more attuned to what’s going on around them. That’s what happened to me: All of a sudden, I began to notice the sun in the sky, the clouds to the west, and Venus setting, and it’s very enriching. It forces you to think in a different way; people tend to be more analytic as a result. Too often we are presented with information in a predigested format. The question becomes: Can you figure it out for yourself? And after a few experiences getting lost and then getting un-lost, you start to develop a certain mentality. Certain research shows that parts of the brain involved in navigation are also involved in imagining scenarios. This is just speculation on my part, but I believe navigating can help us plan for the future.
FM: But you’ll still deign to use a map now and then?
JH: Oh, yeah, but sometimes the map is wrong! And then where will you be?
FM: Have you had any students take “Primitive Navigation” and then go on to have adventures?
JH: Of course! I just heard from one student who got lost in St. Louis, saw the moon rising, and realized that he was facing East. My wife and kids even do it now.


FM: You’ve indoctrinated them?
JH: Well, pretty much [laughing]. Live with someone like me long enough, and pretty soon you catch on.
FM: Are there any other aspects of your life that are
primitive? Like your house, your diet? Your clothes?
JH: Well, I do a lot of stuff out in the woods. I’ve made a cloud chamber in my basement. I cook in the woods and can actually identify many types of edible mushrooms. I like to say that the apocalypse is my hobby.
FM: But you still take showers?
JH: [Laughing] Yes, I still take showers and buy my food at the grocery store. Mostly.

Hyper-extroverted and exceedingly interesting, charmingly awkward and theatrical to a fault, Chase was a veritable bundle of energy who thrived on captivating an audience.
You knew he was in his element when he was in the midst of telling his outlandish tales. He jumped from topic to topic with a polymath’s expertise—I heard stories ranging from the elitism of final club culture to the dark underbelly of investment banking, from the hilarity of stereotyping to the rave-worthy summer he spent abroad, and from the obscurity of old Harvard traditions to (let’s not forget) his personal experiences as a socially adjusted white male in high society. In fact, he was so good at storytelling that you never really knew if he was fabricating realities or living out his fantasies. Chances were, you were too fascinated to care.
Did I mention that he was cute?
His haircut looked expensive—he'd gotten this edgy close shave in the back and longer, windswept bangs up front, bangs he’d habitually run his fingers through whenever too much blonde fell into his eyes. And his eyes—light blue and electric with energy—danced when he smiled. He was a good dresser, too. He wore his privilege and vanity and egotism with a sense of humor, much in the same way he wore his fitted seersucker buttondown or his fancy leather manbag. He also spoke multiple languages and was resident expert of imitating accents, probably because he had one himself.
I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t captivated from the start. I felt myself drawn to him to the point where he was the focus of my attention whenever both of us were in the same room. Sometimes I caught myself staring—at his profile, his jawline, the tuck of his shirt. Whenever he looked in my direction I lowered my eyes, heart pounding, skin tingling from the idea of accidental eye contact. I admit it: I was a schoolgirl with a crush. It was at once exhilarating and familiar, like falling in a dream.
But I couldn't afford to fall for someone like Chase. He took a walk with me one day, explaining that he while was technically in an “open" long-distance relationship, he preferred to keep a steady stream of girls in his life because he didn’t really like being “tied down” to any one person. And I didn’t understand why he was telling me this. I couldn’t figure out if was trying to impress me or sleep with me, brag to me, or incite my jealousy.
All I knew was that after he left I caught myself staring aimlessly at the sidewalk, my breath catching in my throat. It was like my picture of him had been stripped of its glossy veneer, like any semblance of a pedestal had been kicked from beneath his feet. Like reality had finally set in.
They say not to judge a book by its cover because without reading it, how would you know what’s really underneath? And the more books I've picked up, the more I've realized how true this is. As intriguing as Chase seemed on the surface, he was foreign to the concept of loyalty. He was so bent on keeping his “options” open that he’d effectively reduced every girl to an option, sending the clear message that he was too full of himself to make anyone a priority in his life.
It was sad to see intrigue fade into incompatibility, but a part of me whispered that it was time to move on. Because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that no self-respecting girl deserves to be just another option in somebody else’s life.

Midway through February 14th, you happen to open Facebook and make the unpleasant discovery that, once again, it is Valentine’s Day. This is bad news. Everything you do for the rest of the day will now inevitably be pathetic, as you are single on Valentine’s Day.
Never fear, though—you’re bulletproof. “It’s all just a federally created plug for the greeting card companies,” you quip in reply to your roommate’s attempts at sympathy. What you lack in companionship you make up for in snark. “Anyway, I’ve got work to do tonight.”
Widener LibraryBig mistake. Every third aisle is occupied by another pair of giggling, sticky freshmen. All you wanted was to get that copy of Rousseau you reserved; is that too much to ask? Yet the longer you spend walking through the stacks, the more uncomfortably aware you become that you have only one Harvard Challenge left to tick off the list, and no way of doing so in the near future. The air is pallid, and smells like wasted time.
Au Bon PainYou need to make a quick exit from Widener’s depths. Hopping across the street, you find the biggest booth at Au Bon Pain and claim it, glowering at the elderly couple who’d been on the approach.
The whole place is colored bright mustard yellow, in a vain attempt at optimism. Ordering coffee, you suddenly remember that scene in “Good Will Hunting” where Matt Damon and Minnie Driver go on a date outside this exact same café, although Matt dumps Minnie a few scenes later. Staring into the inky swirl of your $4 Americano, you wonder if you will ever have the same luxury.
Flat PattiesScooting out of ABP, the smug specter of Matt Damon’s face close behind, you feel a powerful urge to drown your sorrows in copious amounts of starch and meat.
As soon as you open the door to Flat Patties, you realize your mistake. The place feels empty and lovelorn, like an apartment post-divorce: your beloved Felipe’s has officially moved out. For a moment, you feel tempted to bail and run three doors down: having never actually gotten a burger here, doing so feels like infidelity. But you’re already at the front of the line. The girl behind the counter gives you a desperate stare; you reluctantly place an order. For a moment, you consider asking when she gets off work.
Never mind. The burger tastes like cardboard.
Crema CafeWhat were you thinking? All you wanted was a simple dessert, to keep eating your feelings away. But Crema? The nearby coffee shop has shed its hipster cuteness for a vibe more closely resembling that of a New Delhi train station. Adorable couples pack every cubic foot of this place, with one pair rocking matching Harvard “H” sweaters. If they end up conceiving tonight, will the baby be born wearing a lower-case “h” cardigan?
The guy serving pastries clearly didn’t sign on for this. You try and give him a sympathetic wave, but he’s too busy packing up 13 boxes of cardioid cupcakes. Instead, you sit meekly behind the counter and eat two éclairs by yourself.
LA Burdick Artisanal ChocolatesGlutted with coffee, burgers, pastry, and the sickly weight of your own sexual frustration, you stumble out of Crema and into the night. Your phone rings: one of your blockmates got caught up and needs you to pick up his girlfriend’s present. On to the dark and unholy temple of Valentine’s Day: LA Burdick.
The walls are lined with rows upon rows of delicate morsels. One of their specialties appears to be chocolate mice, which are cute individually but bring up unpleasant memories of your freshman year laundry room when presented in groups. As you wait, you can’t help but overhear the phone conversation nearby: “So I was going to buy the Signature Heart Assortment, but do you think that’d seem cheap? Maybe I should get the Valentine’s Crate, instead?”
You check the price tag on aforementioned Crate: $88.00 plus tax. Maybe the single life isn’t so bad, after all. How much for that delicious-looking white chocolate penguin? No, just one, thanks.

With Valentine’s Day right around the corner, those of us (i.e. not me) in relationships might be curious as to what to give their special someone. Well, luckily, I am an expert gift giver. Just ask my mom, who’s received the exact same Mother’s Day card for going on 10 years. Many Harvard students are tied, nay, married to their student clubs and organizations, so take a cue from what they’re spending one to five to 20 hours a week doing when considering what to bequeath your bae.
ELEGANZAI’ve only been to Eleganza once, and it really gave me a headache. Still, I’ll never forget how shimmery and shiny and tanned all of the dancers/models appeared just weeks after Cambridge had thawed. If your Eleganza babe is anything like me right now, their skin is drier than the Sahara, so take a cue from middle-school-me and spring for some body glitter and a nice moisturizer.
ANSCOMBE SOCIETYI would suggest not getting your abstinence-minded significant other condoms or birth control or a pregnancy test, unless you’re looking to send someone to Mt. Auburn with a stroke, or end a relationship. Instead, try a festive chastity belt, and leave room for Jesus!
HARVARD COLLEGE CONSULTING GROUPIt’s been a rough few weeks for your significant other, trying to sell him or herself to [Bain/McKinsey/BCG] and wade through case interviews in search of a summer internship. Give your lady a foot massage, because nothing sucks more than Cambridge winter in tasteful high heels, or get your man yet another conservative, but fashionable red tie.
HARVARD PRE-MEDICAL SOCIETYDid anyone else watch the premiere of “The Bachelor” this most recent season? Reegan, a contestant whose Mike Fleiss-endowed profession is “donated tissue specialist,” shows up to give Bachelor Chris a cooler with an incredibly realistic fake human heart. So yeah, that’s what I imagine any future doctor might want. But hey, I barely passed my SLS Gen Ed.
HARVARD UNDERGRADUATE BEEKEEPERSWhile I’m no expert in apiary culture or merchandising, you can bee sure that these beekeepers are taking full advantage of all the puns at their disposal this Valentine’s Day. You can bet that there will be no shortage of “Bee Mine” cards on Feb. 14, around the hives. Give your honey the bee’s knees.
MUNCHToo easy. Moving on.
FIFTEEN MINUTES MAGAZINEYour paramour is on the Crimson’s weekly student life magazine? She’s one of its chairs?! It’s me. If you’re looking to buy me a Valentine’s Day gift, here are some things I like to receive: dry Riesling, white peonies, Felipe’s, giant scarves, little chocolate penguins from Burdick’s. You can find me in the newsroom.

Is Valentine’s Day a tool of biopolitical social control? Is the Pope Catholic? Valentine’s Day was originally a pagan holiday appropriated, as so many of them were, by the Catholic Church for nefarious keep-the-people-in-line purposes. (I can say this because I was raised Catholic.) The holiday has since been co-opted by global capitalism, which has defanged the radical potential of free erotic communion by commodifying it in the figures of post-Burning Man Mary Kate and Ashley.
THE OPIATE OF THE MASSES
As Valentine’s Day approaches, I feel steadily uglier—oh global capitalism, up to your antics again! Keep women feeling sad, and we’ll buy all the gym passes and Maybelline foundation you’ve got. Because if we weren’t fixated on being perfect decorative objects, we’d spend less energy buying shit, and more energy reaching the upper echelons of politics, business, and journalism. Also, staging violent revolution.
But let’s be real. If I only felt sexually desired enough, I would shut up about the violent undoing of male domination and lean in to Valentine’s Day. And then it occurs to me: I have an endless source of positive affirmation from random men–OkayCupid! So now, a word from our sponsors:
Hello, nice pic. I would like to get to know you.
Did you hear that, mom? He wants to get to know me—in the biblical sense!
Hi beautiful. How are you doing today?
Okay, whoah. He called me beautiful. Then asked how I’m doing. Normally when men call me beautiful the next question is “So can I put it in?”
Original size?
I don’t know what that refers to. But sure!
Do you think you could help me study for my oral exam?
Okay, alright, not great, not terrible. Pretty terrible. At least he wants to go down.
You look all peachy in those pics <3
I’m also juicy, curvaceous, and covered in fuzzy hair!
I wanna do you good hun.
Oh my! What a proposition. That’s so funny, because I totally want to be done.
Indian ??
No ??
AMORTENTIA
Okay, alright, alright, guys, maybe this Valentine’s thing isn’t going to be so bad. There are 10-15 actual human men (and one Quincy turkey) who would totally engage me in sexual intercourse, filling my womb with seed and my life with purpose.
Or maybe we ladies should forget this whole sex thing. Maybe we should use Valentine’s day as an opportunity to connect with ourselves. That’s right: Rather than devote our thoughts to M-E-N, this Valentine’s day will be sponsored by the letters S-W-U-G. Ladies, listen up: Here are four swuggin’ steps to a V Day all about self love:
1) Take a lux bubble bath: Just you, the bath salts, a bottle of wine, and your sexual anxiety. Tinder from the bathtub.
2) Spa day! Unwind with some pore-clearing masks, a few girlfriends, and a cucumber. For eye-cooling/beverage-making purposes.
3) Dance alone in your room to your favorite song. Throw glances in the mirror every so often to make sure you look like Beyoncé. Know that you do not look like Beyoncé.
4) Have a slumber party with your lady friends! Talk about crushes, your feelings about male authority figures, and how you’re actually a lesbian. Maybe you’ll even make out!
PEACH ANDRÉ
I’m trying to think of a Valentine’s Day that has not felt as anxious as a fitting room, as tense with judgement as a bathroom scale.
February 14, 2014: Breakup argument in my bedroom.
February 14, 2013: Breakup argument at the Kong.
February 14, 2012: Yes, this was a good one. Valentine’s Day my freshman year. I was just beginning my first relationship. We made out on my bed. I had long hair and I think I was still a C cup, and after we macked I went to belly dance practice.
Oh, yes–I can feel it again. The kind of silly you feel the first time you’re in love with some- one who loves you back. You wait by the door and your cheeks are getting red, sort of high on the cheekbones. Your breath starts coming fast. God it feels good. You shower, you wash your hair in a kind of ecstasy, you want to be no one else in the world. God it feels so feverishly good to be you then. Like all the selves you’ve ever been are lined up to meet you. For a second it doesn’t matter how you goddamn look. Because you’re waiting for them. Your heart beating, your blood rising, your heart beating. So you wait. The sound of their footsteps. The knock at the door.

When I hit my roommate with a boomerang, he usually lets out a dispassionate “ow.” I don’t do it too often, but when I do, I enjoy it. Roommate Number Two laughs at Num- ber One’s misfortunes, but it’s okay because we contain our sadomasochism to the com- mon room. When Number Three walks in—arguably the most civilized member of our four-person enterprise—he judges us.
He always judges us. Then, sometimes, he joins.
We’re playing Super Smash Bros. It’s a game, so the boomerang that smacks Number One isn’t real. We play at night, after we’ve been working. Sitting on the black futon that we bought freshman fall, and on the sea-green colossus that we (read: not me) lugged down from the Eliot Cockpit, we relax.
We shed blood for that sea-green couch, on its broken wooden frame and against the doorways too narrow for its glory.
The sea-green couch has come to mean a lot of things to me. Sometimes it’s the semester when I left campus a bit earlier than my roommates, forcing them to carry it alone. This fall, it was moving in for our last year at Harvard, almost breaking it in half to fit it into our corner-infested suite. In every mental image that the couch invokes, my roommates are with it. It is them—the couch’s busted back is Number Two’s sore calf, its deceiving comfortability is Number Three’s hidden, deep sensitivity.
The sea-green couch has now gained a new function: It is the thing that holds me, in the most honest way, when I play Smash in a way that I haven’t in almost 10 years.
Smash has always been around: In elementary and middle school, I played, but in high school I stopped. In hindsight I notice the unsettling correlation between the exit of Smash from my life, and the entrance of the thesis statement into it. Life became a bit realer, a bit less fantastical. I couldn’t cite Wikipedia anymore.
After high school came college. When would I play video games? Didn’t I have to start-up, learn economics, and fix things? The thesis statement that killed Smash became a Thesis, my much-whispered about baby that I nurture in a Dropbox womb.
While my thesis is, in fact, about video games, it’s different. It’s about art and politics and America. It’s not about sitting on a couch with friends and Mario and Pikachu. I love it, but it’s work. Recently, though, I realized that work has the strange potential to consume things. Sleeping became a thing that existed between work and other work; eating was occasionally-yummy work; working at my job turned into a twisted break from work.
To stem the tide of chapters and footnotes, I bought the new Super Smash Bros. I brought it to my beautiful appropriately- sized room on the first floor, and asked my roommates to play. We loved it, of course, and now we play it all the time. Yes, things have changed—we may have a beer or two when we play, and now we have to write theses and find jobs and do things that too rapidly signal the incoming reality that we’re flying into with abandon. But still, we find time to play.
I don’t want to sink myself into a life that doesn’t seek out and enjoy the important things. Money is good, and having nice things is good too. But forgetting about the hunt, the chase that we’ve been on since someone told us that junior year of high school was super important—that’s really good. Seeing that my dear friends can still have fun like they did after practicing mul- tiplication tables? That’s excellent.
And, the truth is, I don’t know when I’ll see them again after these next few months. The couch that I sit on is on a rapid journey to the trash, and my roommates to places they probably haven’t even imagined. So I’ll keep the sight of them on the black futon and me on the sea-green couch, cursing and laughing and huddled around a TV and a table covered with empty cans.

On Friday, Dec. 12, as the temperature dipped into freezing range, a voice rang out. It was rich and clear and cut through the night in waves.
“Hold on, just a little while longer. Everything will be alright,” the voice promised.
A chorus of low hums supported the melody. The voices belonged to the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, a choir created in 1970 as a safe space for black students on campus. The setting was the March on Harvard, which blocked Cambridge streets in protest of the separate non-indictments of white police officers who killed black men last year.
Organizers had invited Kuumba to perform a standard from their set list, “Hold On,” to kick off the protest. After Kuumba finished, applause scattered sparsely through the audience, but most listeners chose to take in the moments after the song in silence.
“The piece is not easy to listen to,” says Haven M. Jones ’15, Kuumba president.“It’s heavy, but it set the mood for the rest of the march—that what we’re doing now will help someone down the line.”
The March on Harvard, which brought together students from schools across Harvard, was a visual manifestation of surging momentum in activism concerned with black identity and rights. Some have termed this recent mobilization the #blacklivesmatter movement. Others, such as Mary F. Brown ’17, call it the second civil rights movement. Still others, such as Sarah F. Cole ’16, see it as a continuation of the struggle for freedom that first began against slavery.
In the past year, students have participated and organized initiatives from the “I, Too, Am Harvard” theater production and photo campaign to a “die-in” on the steps of Memorial Church to a controversial protest at Primal Scream. 
Such highly visible demonstrations have forcefully confronted citizens of Harvard and beyond with what it’s like to be young and black in America, while confirming the experiences of those who do know, according to History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93. But the purpose of the movement is not only to raise awareness, organizers say. Behind the scenes, aided by the quiet of reflection during summer and winter breaks, supported by newfound activist connections, and encouraged by older mentors, students have transformed how they contribute to the movement.
“A lot of the activism that has existed up to this point has been a values-based fight. What is justice? What is fairness? What is morality?” says Cole, president of the Black Students Association. “But for this movement to be sustainable and productive, we’ll also have to say what it is that we want, tangibly.”
And so that solemn but hopeful performance of “Hold On” by Kuumba not only set the mood for the March on Harvard, but may also predict the mood for the rest of this activist revival. Students involved recognize their unique access to the Harvard name and resources for making substantive change, and they aren’t simply sitting on such a privilege. As activists transition the movement from one of dialogue to policy change, they have also expanded their vision to include communities outside the Yard.
Performing at the March on Harvard is only one of the many ways Kuumba regularly shows support for black student activism. Every year while on tour, Kuumba sets time aside for a tradition, a “tour conversation” in which its members openly discuss issues of race, Kuumba’s mission, and black creativity. It is shocking. It is uncomfortable. There is laughing. There is crying.
In the spring of 2013, a group of freshman friends went to lunch at a diner, preparing themselves for the intense personal discussion of the “conversation.”
“Why are we so shocked to hear the sound of our own voices?” Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16 recalls asking herself throughout the “conversation.”
Paige R. Woods ’16 chaired Kuumba’s Black Arts Festival the next year and suggested that Matsuda-Lawrence create something for the festival. Its theme reminded Woods of Langston Hughes and his poem “I, Too.” Over the summer, Woods excitedly called Matsuda-Lawrence with the news that she had thought of a title for the project: “I, Too, Am Harvard.” And so was born the project that would draw national media attention to black students at Harvard.
Before long, Matsuda-Lawrence would begin the labor-intensive effort to interview 60 students about their experiences as people of color at Harvard. She reached out to other peers for help.
“We were all either roommates or friends, we practically lived with each other, spending all our time planning the play and the publicity and the kick-off,” Matsuda-Lawrence says.
The team expected only Kuumba friends to show up to the play. It was sold out. A photo campaign leading up to the production’s theatrical debut inspired dozens of imitation campaigns around the world, on campuses ranging from Wellesley to Oxford, and instigated national dialogue on what activists have deemed racial micro-aggressions. “I, Too, Am Harvard,” while first conceptualized and made concrete in an arts environment, had become a vehicle for protest.
Months later, a grand jury in Staten Island, N.Y., decided not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, a white New York police officer who had killed Eric Garner, who was black. The non-indictment in Garner’s case followed a similar incident halfway across the country in Ferguson, Mo., where a grand jury chose not to indict Darren Wilson, who had shot and killed the teenage Michael Brown.
Hours after the Staten Island decision, two freshmen at Harvard texted each other about their anger over the decision and desire to react to such anger with something constructive. They wanted to buy surgical masks and hand them out to symbolize what Garner felt as he was held in a chokehold before his death.
In spontaneity, they trekked to Harvard University Health Services in search of the masks; they went to the stock room in the basement. An employee there was so sympathetic to their intentions that he gave the two students the rest of the surgical mask supply, according to one of the students, Robert Rush ’18.
They pair enlisted two more friends for help, one for her artistic background and another for her previous activism experience. They wrote “I Can’t Breathe” on the masks and wore them at a demonstration in Boston the next night. The four students—Rush, Ellery C. Jones ’18, Caroline N. Goldfarb ’18, and Sammy H. Koppelman ’18, an active Crimson magazine editor— continued buying, writing on, and handing out masks for various events throughout the semester. They disseminated more than 700 in total.
“Voice can be very loud and evocative, but there’s unique power in silence,” Rush says of the masks’ symbolism.
This purposeful silencing, this addition to the movement, was not coordinated by a formal organization cemented in activism, but rather by four freshmen who were acquaintances.
“We’re all just friends, the fact that we all cooperated on this was just the luck of fate,” Rush muses.
The “I Can’t Breathe” masks are not the only example of campus activism fostered by a group of friends. Even though affinity groups and other student organizations carve out niches on campus, they do not function in a vacuum. The networks of social ties between students lead to collaboration, not only between students of different groups on campus, but also between students from schools nationwide.
Brown recalls the most personally moving protest she has participated in. The protest ended in front of a local jail, where Brown says she could see all the inmates standing at the windows holding up signs of support.
Transportation to the protest was not organized by a formal organization such as the Association of Black Harvard Women, of which Brown is a member, but rather by Sydney K. Jenkins ’16, Brown’s friend. Jenkins emailed various lists, offering Phillips Brooks House Association vans to bus people into Boston for the protest.
Although official groups provide students formal mechanisms for organizing and publicizing, paneling and protesting, students don’t always choose to use them, partially because organizers say they can be limiting. Cole, BSA president, says it is difficult to broadly represent a group when its membership is so diverse.
“You have to be careful with what you endorse as an organization, because what you endorse reflects on all the individuals of the organization,” Cole says.
And so forgoing the model of traditional top-down organizing from the board of a student group, individual activists on campus formed loose, overlapping networks of friends and resources. Social group by social group, the spirit of activism took hold.
Such social connections have enabled student activists to take action that extends beyond Harvard’s campus. This past October, the team behind “I, Too, Am Harvard” and a coalition of students from various black affinity groups worked together to host Harvard’s inaugural “Blacktivism” conference, a workshop-filled event that brought hundreds of other college students to Harvard’s campus. Programming included talks on how to negotiate for policy change and how to apply social media skills to activism.
At the conference, Harvard students made connections with activists from other campuses. Woods, who co-chaired the conference, exclaims at the Facebook activist network that arose from the conference.
“We all comment on each other’s posts and discussions, and so many projects have sprung up just because of the friends we made during the conference,” she says.
Woods recounts stories of activists who didn’t know they were working on the same projects in different locations before meeting at Harvard.
Earlier this month, Woods also attended Smith College’s Young, Gifted, and Black conference with several other Harvard students. At the summit, Woods reunited with students she first met at the Blacktivism conference last year. She also expanded her own network, meeting activist artists she will bring to Harvard later this month for the Black Arts Festival.
And on Feb. 19, 15 Harvard students will travel to Yale for the 20th Annual Black Solidarity Conference, which will newly implement “ujima groups” this year. An ujima group is a discussion group of random conference attendees, “deliberately designed to give students the opportunity to make cross-school connections,” according to Nia Froome, a senior at Yale and president of the conference.
These conferences build upon already existent and strong ties between students at elite institutions. Colin H. Marts ’16, president of the Harvard Black Men’s Forum, chuckles as he names his contacts on other campuses. He regularly texts the president of the Black Men’s Union at Yale. He’s close friends with the former president of Brown’s Black Students Union.
“The competitive school network is much more connected than people imagine. It’s just a matter of exploring those options, and we are currently exploring them,” Marts says. Marts is also a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the first black, intercollegiate fraternity in the nation. APA boasts luminaries such as Martin Luther King, Jr., and Thurgood Marshall amongst its alumni. He cites APA as a foundational resource in developing his activist network.
Back in Cambridge, student action has not been restricted to the College. One night in late November of last year, Victoria White-Mason, a third-year student at Harvard Law School, hosted over 50 activists from across the schools of the University in her living room. The goal was to organize the University-wide March on Harvard. The room buzzed with energy.
“Everyone was from different schools and had different goals, different challenges, different perspectives. It was amazing to see all that power harnessed in one room,” White-Mason recalls.
The idea for the March on Harvard first came to White-Mason while she worked in Ferguson with the coordinators of the national “Black Lives Matter” movement for two weeks. She wanted to bring their tactics back to Harvard.
When she did bring those tactics back to Cambridge, a number of schools joined her. Activists from the Graduate School of Design helped out on creative projects while activists from the Graduate School of Education worked on education policy.
“The idea is that every school, every student has something to bring to the movement,” White-Mason says.
Those first inter-school meetings led to the formation of the Harvard Ferguson Action Coalition, which seeks to link up activists across Harvard’s schools. HFAC is still in its early planning stages, but has already served as a platform for making connections between schools. A few Law School students from the coalition attended Primal Scream last semester to support the protesters in case of legal challenge.
Despite moving to collaborate with groups outside Harvard, student activists at the College have not diverted their attention away from Harvard-specific issues, often including demands on the administration.
Last spring, a group of students founded the Diversity Report, which functions as a report card on administrative action, grading administrators on various “assignments” ranging from “The Harvard Foundation Budget” to “Race Relations Tutors Preparation.” The students who founded the Diversity Report, including Cole, said they did so because they felt that although the College admits a diverse class of students every year, it does not invest enough in students of color to help them thrive.
One area that the Diversity Report targeted was Community Conversations, the programming that welcomes freshmen into discussions of differences in background during Opening Days. After students complained that it had been poorly facilitated, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 assembled a student committee to garner feedback.
“From the feedback, we realized that Community Conversations would be better further in the term, when people feel greater comfort in considering who they are and whether they travel with particular challenges or privileges,” Dingman says.
This semester, faculty will lead a new group of students in rewriting the structure of Community Conversations, according to Dingman.
The Institute of Politics, too, has reformed the structure of its programming to include more dialogue on diversity issues. In spring 2014, a group of students founded the Politics of Race and Ethnicity Initiative, the only program within the IOP that specifically focuses on topics of inclusion and race.
“We had a lot of conversations about how race is portrayed in the IOP, about the lack of diversity at the IOP, and we wanted to make sure we always had a place and home for such conversations,” says Osaremen F. Okolo ’17, who co-chairs the program.
Also at the IOP, the inklings of a policy paper came together when students, including Fadhal A. Moore ’15, Amanda D. Bradley ’15, and Temitope A. Agabalogun ’15, sought to focus on the potential benefits of body cameras and how such cameras could deter police misconduct in light of the recent incidents in Ferguson and Staten Island. They finished the paper three weeks ago and will proliferate it to different policymaking institutions at the local, state, and national level.
“We just wanted to contribute to the conversation in a meaningful way,” Moore says.
Some student activists see their connection to Harvard not as an opportunity, but rather as an obligation, to make a difference in the world. The Harvard name alone can call national media attention to an event or issue, according to ABHW president Cary A. Williams ’16. Williams sees that name and the access it provides as the primary advantages Harvard students can lend to the broader black activist movement.
“We’re not smarter than anyone else. We shouldn’t be the voice of black youth just because we go to Harvard,” Williams says. “We realize community activists have been doing this work for years. What we offer is the connections to help them move more quickly.”
Activists will also continue to reach out to the broader Cambridge and Boston communities. Three weeks ago, Marts was a speaker on a community panel in Roxbury, Mass., on police brutality and sustainable race dialogue.
“We’re looking to collaborate with more community organizers, to contribute in a way that isn’t solely Harvard-focused,” Marts says.
If the spike in recent activism on campus is indicative of anything of the student body, it is that Harvard students can be more and can do more than they have led on. Many of the contributors to the rise in activism, however, are seniors graduating in less than a semester, leaving behind them a campus accustomed to their leadership. Some of these seniors will pursue a career in advocacy themselves.
“I’ll be teaching next year, and I believe teaching is activism,” Moore says, leaning forward. “I’ll be helping students think critically about their implicit biases.”
For the underclassmen that remain, the departing seniors represent years of close friendship, mentorship, and guidance. After a “tumultuous” year as BMF president, Rodriguez S. Roberts ’15 has the perspective to reflect on leadership sustainability in an organization, calmly laying out his recommendations. Roberts suggests that minority affinity groups continue these patterns of mentorship and reach out to high school students the second they get on campus.
“Mentorship of the younger generations is important,” Roberts says. “In a couple years, the students that were here won’t be. We must pass off the torch onto freshmen, and instruct them to do the same.”
Such a freshman is Nuha Saho ’18, an intern at the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations. Saho first connected with Harvard student activism when “I, Too, Am Harvard” launched its photo campaign the spring of his senior year in high school. When he stepped onto campus for Visitas, he had one wish: to meet the founders of “I, Too, Am Harvard.”
“Honestly, they convinced me to come to Harvard,” Saho says. “I knew then that it was my time to step up and come here and continue what they’re doing.”
In the coming years, each incoming class may bring a new group of activists as the student movement here grows its national presence.
In alternative spaces of protest such as the arts, Kuumba’s Black Arts Festival, a weeklong celebration of blackness and creativity, expects more than 500 people in attendance this year. The festival begins in late February.
The festival will be unlike any of its past iterations. It will span an entire week instead of just a weekend and spotlight activism with art that presents a social or political message. Woods, who chaired the festival last year, mentored current chair Cherline Bazile ’17 in planning and preparing for this year. Woods connected Bazile with artist activists, including a man who has been going to protests around the nation and documenting them. They will both participate in the festival.
In an effort to reach out to Cambridge at large, Bazile moved the community showcase off-campus to Central Square, so that Cambridge residents “feel more comfortable attending.”
“This semester will be one in which a lot will happen,” Bazile said. “We want to make sure BAF is a part of that, especially in validating art as a means of activism, as something that can cause change.”
Other upcoming opportunities for engagement include the Kennedy School of Government’s Black Policy Conference in April and an activism conference at the Law School that White-Mason says is in the works for April as well.
“We’ve been doing a lot of thinking. And we’ll be acting on those thoughts, soon,” Cole says.
Cole mentioned a new #blacklivesmatter photo campaign. Okolo intimated that “I, Too, Am Harvard” is planning something again. Marts hinted at BMF plans that aren’t yet ready to go public.
It’s said that the eye of the storm is calm. It would be a mistake to interpret relatively quiet winds in the past month as a sign of incoming blue skies. Students are merely regrouping, revising, rethinking how to transform their activism.
“It’s like a death in the family; the grief level is like nothing else you’ve ever experienced, but you can’t let yourself fall apart,” White-Mason says. “To honor the lives of the people we lost, we must press on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 11, 2015, at 11:53 p.m.
Harvard will construct a five-story addition to Gore Hall, one of two buildings that currently comprise Winthrop House, when the residence is renovated in 2016-2017 as part of Harvard's more than $1 billion House renewal project, according to plans released Wednesday.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Assistant Dean for Physical Resources Merle Bicknell, current space limitations in Winthrop prompted plans for the addition. Originally constructed not as an upperclassman House but as two freshman dormitories for 291 students, Winthrop currently houses 355 undergraduates, according to Bicknell. An additional 56 Winthrop students currently live in “overflow” housing in DeWolfe.
The new addition, which will be named “Winthrop East,” would eliminate the need for overflow housing for Winthrop, Bicknell said. A garage used by Winthrop’s House masters and other Harvard affiliates currently sits on the corner of Mill and Plympton Streets, where Winthrop East will ultimately be constructed.
In addition to more student housing, Harvard also plans to construct a first floor lobby in Winthrop East, although ideas and other amenities will be discussed in student feedback sessions. Other major changes to the House, according to Bicknell, include an expanded dining hall and the relocation of the Winthrop masters' residence to a stand-alone house connected to Winthrop East by a terrace.
Winthrop’s Gore and Standish Halls will remain separated because connecting them was ultimately unfeasible due to utility and historical features, Bicknell said.
Administrators are also currently considering including study nooks, more social spaces, and horizontal connections between the House’s vertical entryways, which are all features of the three previous or ongoing House renewal projects—Quincy House’s Stone Hall, Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall, and Dunster House, which is currently under renovation and slated to re-open to students next fall.
Regardless of the details of the final plan, Bicknell said the renovated House will include “a lot” of additional space for House programming because of the new addition, and at least two-thirds of student housing will be suite-style. The renewed buildings in Quincy and Leverett include a mix of suites and single and double bedrooms off hallways.
Administrators held one student feedback session on the plans on Tuesday evening and have more planned on Feb. 17 and Feb. 24. During the planned one-year break in House renewal construction in 2015-2016 leading up to Winthrop’s renovation, administrators will further evaluate the renewal projects in Quincy, Leverett, and Dunster, and the results may inform plans for Winthrop, Bicknell said.
While construction on Winthrop will not officially start until summer 2016, Harvard will start replacing Winthrop windows and chimneys, and making other minor alterations starting this June, Bicknell said.
While their House is under construction, Dunster students currently live in swing spaces in Harvard Square, including the building near Harvard Yard that once housed the Inn at Harvard. Bicknell said administrators will decide in the coming weeks how they will utilize those swing spaces during the construction break next academic year.
Administrators will also soon decide which House to renew after Winthrop, though primary candidates remain the River Houses Kirkland, Eliot, and Lowell, she said.
FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven sat in on The Crimson’s interview with Bicknell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority will host a series of public hearings in March to help decide the future of the pilot program that keeps the T open late on the weekends. One of the four potential options presented in the MBTA’s Interim Review is to discontinue the program altogether.
The late-night T, which began in part as an effort to make Greater Boston more compatible with the lifestyles of young professionals, keeps MBTA services open until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights.
The pilot period program began last March and is set to expire in June. The five public hearings, one of which will be in Cambridge at the Sheraton Commander Hotel on March 9, will take place between March 2 and March 11.  In addition, a Twitter town hall will be held on March 2, under the hashtag #latenightservice.
After the hearings, the MBTA will make a final recommendation to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation board of directors on April 15.
College students represent a large portion of the users of the late night service, with the heaviest usage of the late-night stations occurring in neighborhoods with large student populations, according to the report. Harvard Station represented the 4th busiest late-night station.
Boston City Councilwoman Michelle Wu ’07 said last week that the program would help keep students in the Greater Boston region post-graduation. Yesterday, at a Council meeting, she and Councilman Josh Zakim filed an order for a hearing regarding the program’s continuation.
“Many students after they graduate college immediately think about going to [other cities], so what we need to do as a city is do a better job of retaining the talent that comes here,” she said. “Part of that is that Boston needs to be more welcoming place for young people, and having an exciting, accessible nightlife, is a big part of that.”
Former Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said he strongly supports the continuation of the service extension.
“I highly encourage Harvard students to go out, go to as many meetings as they can,” he said. “This time more than ever it is critical that young people like Harvard students get engaged in community matters [that] mean a lot to them.”
In its report, the MBTA listed four options for the future of the program: elimination, cost reduction through service adjustments, fare changes, and sponsorships.
With a state budget deficit of approximately $765 million, some officials say whether or not to continue the program, which would cost $12.9 million, will be a difficult call.
“I think it’s too early to say it’s on the chopping block,” then-acting MassDOT secretary Frank Depaola told a State House News Service reporter last month. “But in the light of our current state budgetary issues, we do have to be fiscally prudent.”
The MBTA presented its report on the program at a board meeting Wednesday, after a highly-anticipated discussion of the MBTA’s closures in the recent snow season.
At that meeting, speakers and MBTA board members defended MBTA General Manager Beverly Scott, who had come under fire for MBTA suspensions of services in the past week. Dr. Scott publicly announced her resignation in a letter to MBTA board members later that afternoon.

At a meeting of the Graduate Student Council on Wednesday, students of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences lamented an unusually high level of uncertainty in their teaching plans for sections as a result of two consecutive snow days this week.
The closure of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s office on Monday and Tuesday, and the extension of the deadline for add/drop forms, complicated the finalization of class rosters, said John Gee, a GSAS student and teaching fellow in the History department. Without this information, he said, it is very hard to ensure that everyone has been placed in a section.
“This is another week that students are not meeting with their TFs,” Gee said. “I am still finalizing what sections my students are in and, in fact, how many students are enrolled in the course,” he said. “There are still students dribbling in, people dropping, people adding.”
The combination of these factors, GSC President Summer A. Shafer said, have caused professors to seek out teaching fellows for their courses unusually late in the semester.
“In my department, the administrators sent out emails saying ‘TFs needed in this class. TFs needed in that class.’ There have been more of those than I have ever seen before,” she said. “I think the classes [that] enrolled more than expected are struggling to find people.”
As a result, some teaching fellows have been asked to teach sections much larger than the suggested 18-person cap, while courses struggle to find more teaching fellows.
“Someone was basically teaching a 30-person section,” said Caley C. Smith, a doctoral student in South Asian Studies and the representative-at-large for the Humanities. “But I just heard recently that they had added a few more sections. But in the interim, they just had TFs teaching 30-person sections.”
Shafer said she believes the solution to the uncertainty surrounding course enrollments and teaching fellow allotments ultimately rests in instituting a course enrollment system that begins before students arrive back on campus.
“We need pre-enrollment and pre-sectioning so people decide their sectioning ahead of time,” Shafer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reflecting on his “twenty-first century” rise from unemployed bond trader to viral blogger, Brandon Stanton—founder of the popular online photo series “Humans of New York”—spoke to a packed audience at the Institute of Politics on Wednesday.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event came a day after HONY ended its Indiegogo fundraising campaign, which received national attention and raised more than $1.4 million. The campaign aimed to enable sixth graders from Mott Hall Bridges Academy, a middle school located in Brownsville, Brooklyn, to visit Harvard every year. About half of the funds raised will establish a scholarship fund.
Producing a blog that features photos and brief interviews of strangers that he meets on the streets of New York City, Stanton has amassed more than 12 million likes on Facebook. Stanton’s last high-profile visit to campus was in 2013, taking HONY-style photographs in the wake of the Boston marathon bombings.
“Humans of New York is a quintessence of America’s great city, but it is also of course about our world at large, a celebration of [our] diversity, our common humanity, and a joyful declaration that whatever this life is, we’re all in it together,” IOP Director Margaret A. “Maggie” Williams, who moderated the event, said.
Stanton said his recent interview with President Barack H. Obama and his 2014 world tour with the United Nations underscored the power and “intrinsic value of [the] stories and individuals” he has shared over the past four years.
Although HONY’s mass popularity has affected his work in that interviewees familiar with the project can self-censor or embellish their stories, Stanton said his experience helps him to guide the conversation in a more meaningful and authentic direction.
“A lot of times people who know the blog are worried about saying the correct thing instead of the honest thing,” he said. “All I can say is that my goal in all of this is a moment of authenticity.”
In an interview before the event, Stanton emphasized that students debating whether to follow their creative ambitions or pursue a more lucrative and stable job should not wait for a “silver bullet” idea but should instead take a risk and commit themselves to something they love.
“The Humans of New York that was self-sustaining financially and that’s successful today looks nothing like the Humans of New York that I decided to commit my life to,” he reflected. “And if I had sat around and waited until I had an idea to be a successful photographer, I would still be in finance.”
Stanton noted that the modern level playing field and access to tools was what made his story possible.
“The Harvard degree you guys are going to get is going to be less valuable than it has ever been before,” he said. “However, the work ethic and the smarts that got you into this school will be more valuable than ever.”

A three-alarm fire broke out at about 7 p.m. Wednesday inside the housing complex at 1610 Massachusetts Ave., according to Cambridge Fire Department Assistant Chief James Burns.
The housing complex is located across the street from a Harvard Law School building and close to the Radcliffe Quad. The apartment building had to be fully evacuated, Burns said.
According to Burns, there were about 12 to 15 fire trucks present from multiple departments, including Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville.
“The fire was contained to a small area…[and we] kept damage to a minimum,” Burns said. “Everyone is safe, nobody got hurt.”
Burns said he believed that the fire began underneath a bathroom on the first floor of the building, although he declined to speculate as to the cause.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 attended a meeting of the Faculty Council—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ highest elected body—Wednesday to discuss administrative transparency with faculty, pledging to meet with the body once a semester.
The meeting comes on the heels of faculty criticisms of changes to the health benefits policy for Harvard’s non-union employees and the University’s approach to announcing and devising the changes.
Throughout last semester, faculty lamented their lack of representation on the University Benefits Committee, which included only one tenured FAS member—Government professor Daniel Carpenter.
Garber’s meeting with the Faculty Council comes after the release of a detailed fact sheet of the University’s health benefits expenditures on Friday. Though Faculty members said that they appreciate the efforts by University administrators to be more transparent about the health benefits policy and its implications, some said that the overall burden of cost to individuals affected by the policy was greater than costs to the University.
Following fierce opposition to the changes, the Faculty Council sent Garber a letter at the end of last semester inviting him to one of the group’s meetings to discuss the role of the faculty in future administrative decisions, according to Council members.
Garber wrote in an email that Wednesday’s meeting dealt with “consultation and communication for major policy changes,” and that he found the discussion at the meeting helpful. He also wrote that he met with the body last semester, and in previous academic years.
In a similar attempt to communicate with administrators, a group of Faculty members met with University President Drew G. Faust last semester to discuss the changed policy. This came after members of FAS unanimously voted to request that Faust and the Harvard Corporation reverse the policy at their November meeting.
The meeting with Faust, in part, was an effort to learn more about the University’s health benefits expenditures.
Related data were released in the fact sheet sent out earlier this week, stating that Harvard will save an estimated $6.4 million in Fiscal Year 2015 as a result of the policy changes. Additionally, the document estimated that costs will rise an average of $230.31 per affected non-union employee and that these employees will take on $2.5 million collectively.
“It’s a much higher percentage of the household budget for an employee,” History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96 said.
History professor Mary D. Lewis, for her part, said that although the fact sheet reported that less than 1 percent of affected families would reach the out-of-pocket maximum of $4,500, many people would barely come under threshold.
“How many people will reach $4,000, $3,500?” she said. “That’s still a lot of money for many people.”
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, who along with Lewis and nine other faculty members co-wrote an op-ed in The Crimson criticizing the changes, agreed, noting that families could still pay a significant amount of money out-of-pocket.
“Couples with kids may not reach full amounts, but they may get pretty close,” Thomas said.

Visitors to Mather House face translucent gauze, string, and wooden bows suspended from the building’s columns from the moment they enter the foyer. This art exhibit, a part of a project called “Mather Build,” was celebrated in conjunction with the student photo campaign “In The Making” at a reception in Mather House’s Three Columns Gallery on Wednesday evening.
Mather Gallery curator Matthew R. Terry said “Mather Build” was meant to be “experimental and playful,” so that both artists and non-artists could participate.
Kevin Hong ’15, a Mather resident and assistant curator who assisted Terry in executing the project, described the project as “fun” because of its unique participatory creation process. Mather residents collectively created the displays directly onto the column walls within a span of several hours.
Hong also noted that the project attracts viewers to focus on distinct features of Mather’s architecture, such as its columns, adding that “the results change because of the daylight and conditions.”
According to Mather House Masters Christie A. McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten, “Mather Build” is a continuation of earlier efforts to display Mather students’ collective work in the gallery, such as the previously exhibited student-created murals.
For Curtis L. Lahaie ’15 and Kyle J. McFadden ’18, creators of “In The Making,” the display in Mather is the culmination of their photo project to raise awareness on LGBTQ issues. On the walls of the gallery upstairs are five out of the 62 total portraits they took of Harvard students holding a blackboard, emblazoned with hand-written phrases including “I shouldn’t have to prove my bisexuality” and “No student should feel unsafe.”
The campaign, which kicked off in early November and included a sixty-day fundraiser, raised over $6,400 for organizations working on queer issues and spurred participation from various campuses nationwide, including the College of William & Mary, according to Lahaie. Neither Lahaie nor McFadden are Mather residents.
Both “Mather Build” and “In the Making” will be displayed in Mather’s art gallery until at least the end of February, Terry said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 13, 2015, at 2:14 a.m.
Roughly 20 students remained in Massachusetts Hall, home to the office of University President Drew G. Faust, late Thursday night after a group of more than 30 stormed and occupied the building that morning, demanding that Harvard divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels.
Though the group, Divest Harvard, detailed plans on Thursday night for a Friday afternoon rally outside of Mass. Hall, co-coordinator Talia K. Rothstein '17 said that the remaining protesters had no immediate plans to leave the building.
The occupation began Thursday morning at about 10 a.m. when more than 30 members of Divest, many dressed in orange, entered the building and followed an administrator through a door that would otherwise have been locked. Once inside Mass. Hall’s first floor hallway, which contains the offices of Faust, Provost Alan. M. Garber ’76, and others, the protesters quickly hoisted a banner calling on Harvard to divest.
By 10:10 a.m., a receptionist had called the Harvard University Police and officers had arrived at Mass. Hall.
After the protesters settled in, chronicling their entrance on social media along the way, Faust offered to meet with protesters at a location outside of the building, but only on the condition that the protesters leave, according to Jeff Neal, her spokesperson.
The group refused. Instead they offered counterproposals, including meeting with Faust inside Mass. Hall or sending two delegates to another location for the meeting and leaving the rest of the group inside the hallway.
Divest Harvard member Canyon S. Woodward ’15 said the occupation plan had been in the works since last fall, but he would not say how long the protesters, who were accompanied by a filmmaker, planned to stay.
“We’re trying to put as much pressure on them as possible,” Woodward said Thursday morning. “We are going to reiterate our call for divestment—we’re no longer settling for a meeting—we have to take action now.”
Officials have not made the extended stay comfortable. Sometime in the early afternoon, HUPD officers blocked the only bathroom the protesters had access to and encouraged the Divest Harvard group to use one elsewhere, according to Rothstein. Rothstein said some protesters had brought diapers.
As the sit-in wore on, Divest’s continued presence brought reactions from the administration. In an emailed statement Thursday afternoon, Neal wrote that while administrators respect the activists’ views, they are “deeply disappointed” in the protestors’ decision to occupy Mass. Hall, which he called “disrespectful and coercive interference.”
“Today and in the future, our students will be treated with the respect they have chosen not to accord those who work in the building,” Neal added.
Divest Harvard responded with a group statement in the late afternoon, writing that the group was “saddened by [Faust’s] characterization of our action when we are continuing a legacy of civil disobedience that has brought real change to our university.”
When the protesters had not left late Thursday night, Neal released another statement after he was asked for an update on the administration’s response.
“While we are disappointed that student-activists have chosen to adopt these disruptive and disrespectful tactics,” he wrote, “Harvard remains committed to the teaching, learning and research that will bring real solutions to climate change.”
Earlier in the evening, the group of protesters became slightly smaller when HUPD officers said non-Harvard affiliates could face criminal charges for trespassing, according to Rothstein. Officers also photographed the protesters and their Harvard identification cards. According to Kelsey C. Skaggs, a Harvard Law School student who left the sit-in around 5 p.m., the protesters were told that their schools would be notified of their participation.
Thursday’s sit-in fell on the eve of Global Divestment Day, planned by activists to push for divestment from fossil fuels. It is not the first major protest that the Divest Harvard campaign, which has been active for more than two years, has executed at Mass. Hall—last spring, several members blocked the front entrance of the administrative building. One of its members was arrested, but Harvard did not press charges.
Faust has repeatedly argued against divestment, characterizing it as neither “warranted or wise” in an October 2013 open letter.
In 2001, a group of protesters occupied Mass. Hall for 21 days, forcing then-President Neil L. Rudenstine to work elsewhere. That group was campaigning for higher wages for Harvard employees. After the occupation, many Harvard workers did receive wage hikes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With three losses last week, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team is officially on the bubble.
After dropping games to No. 15/- Yale and Brown, the No. 14/13 Crimson sits 16th in the PairWise rankings, an objective metric that predicts selection to the 16-team NCAA tournament. The weekend sweep followed a 3-2 double-overtime defeat against No. 3/2 Boston University in the first round of the Beanpot on Tuesday.
Conference rival No. 13/14 Quinnipiac now leads Harvard in the PairWise at 13th, while St. Lawrence and Yale lurk just behind at 17th and 18th, respectively.
Harvard also dropped from No. 6 to No. 14 in the USCHO.com poll and from No. 6 to No. 13 in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll.  The team is 2-7-0 in 2015 after finishing the 2014 half of its season 10-1-2.
Coach Ted Donato ’91 and his team will look to halt their season-worst losing streak this weekend, when they host Colgate (T-21, PairWise) on Friday and Cornell (T-27) on Saturday.
No. 1/1 Minnesota State heads the PairWise rankings, followed by No. 2/3 North Dakota and BU.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Basketball coaches worry. Concern might as well be in the job description, right between recruiting and game planning. It’s no different for Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker. And over the last week, he has had plenty to worry about.
For one, there was the back-and-forth battle with bottom-dwelling Brown Friday. Amaker needed a herculean effort—and then a herculean second effort—from his best player to even get that game into overtime. The Crimson eventually pulled a win out, 76-74. But that wasn’t the game everybody was fretting over.
The next night, Harvard traveled to face Ivy-leading Yale. Amaker had to worry about his team’s energy and composure, an Ivy League Player of the Year candidate dressed in blue, and plenty more as the Crimson hung on for a 52-50 win.
All his worrying paid off with a huge weekend for Harvard—one that vaulted it back into first place in the league.
But causes for concern keep coming.  Soon after the team got back to Cambridge, the Crimson coaches scheduled extended activities for Sunday. Players got medical treatment and had a team lift and a team stretch. There was also film study—a Sunday rarity—as Mother Nature threatened Monday’s schedule.
“Thank goodness,” Amaker said Wednesday, recalling the prescient decision to autopsy the Brown and Yale games before the ensuing snowstorm canceled Monday’s practice.
What Amaker and his team saw on tape only brought more things to worry about. This weekend, Harvard will face the best offense and the best defense it will see in league play, Amaker said Wednesday.
Such is life in the Ancient Eight.
Friday, Columbia (11-9, 3-3) comes to the Lavietes Pavilion. The Lions are third in the standings with the third-highest margin of victory and the fourth-best KenPom score. Paper says they are the toughest test for Harvard outside of Yale. History agrees.
Columbia pushed the Crimson to double overtime in New York last season and beat them by 15 the year before that.
“They have played exceptionally well against us—beaten us—and we have played some incredibly hard-fought, entertaining games against them,” Amaker said. “We’ve been in those kinds of situations where you have to be a little fortunate to come out on top.”
This year, Maodo Lo, the league’s fourth most prolific three-point maker and second highest scorer, leads the Lions. The team as a whole is second in the conference in three-pointers made, thanks largely to Lo, Steve Frankoski, and Kyle Castlin. Those three will try to stretch Harvard’s defense to limit the Crimson’s advantage down low.
“It’s never fun playing against them,” senior forward Jonah Travis said. “They are always going to give you their best punch and you know it’s always going to be a dogfight.”
Saturday, Cornell (11-11, 3-3) brings another set of concerns to Cambridge. The Big Red leads the league in field goal defense and is third in points allowed per game. Cornell has posted those numbers thanks to a pressing defense that has forced 13 turnovers per game and a back line that leads the Ivies in blocks per game.
“That’s what we are worried about,” Amaker said of the Big Red press. “Some people have taken some chances [pressing us] and we haven’t handled it as well as we would have liked.”
Early in the year, for instance, Harvard turned the ball over 24 times and lost to a pressing Holy Cross squad. Still, Amaker said, he’d be glad to see Cornell stretch its defense and get aggressive.
“For a [Harvard] team that has struggled to score a little bit,” he said, breaking the press can lead to easy buckets.
Instead, one of Amaker’s biggest concerns is that his team isn’t worrying enough.
After the team’s loss to Dartmouth, the seniors rallied the group, the Crimson showed its toughness, and the players ran off four straight road victories.
Now they return home and find themselves fully healthy for the first time all year. That might seem like a good position to be in, but for a basketball coach, it’s just the cause of another worry.
“One of my biggest fears it that because we are coming home after being on the road for two weekends, are you ready to ‘phew?’—to have that kind of attitude and think because you’re home it’s supposed to happen for you,” Amaker said. “That’s not the way it works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another year, another hoisting up of the annual Beanpot trophy for the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams. With three wide-margin victories over, MIT, Boston College, and host Brandeis, the women cruised to their eighth consecutive Beanpot berth, while the men battled through injuries to finish 3-0 against the same schools for the same honor as their female counterparts.
The wins came a little more than 48 hours after competing at the Ivy Round Robins, at which the men walked away with a share of the Ivy title while the women finished tied for second. Despite injuries to fencers of varying severity, both Crimson squads took the short ride to the home of the Owls for yet another cycle of competition on Wednesday evening.
“We definitely worked together as a team even though we were all exhausted from competing in the past weekend,” sophomore foilist Liana Yamin said. “And then we came out for a successful day.”
HARVARD WOMEN’S FENCING
Given that the Crimson women never allowed anyone in the rest of the field close with three wins of at least 11 bouts, ignorant bystanders might not have known that the team was coming off a full tournament weekend just days before.
“We’re all still pretty tired from [this past weekend],” Yamin said. “We definitely expelled our energy at Ivies, [with] people coming off injuries. So coming into this, we had to psyche ourselves up and get ready for a third day of competition in such a short time.”
The Eagles came the closest to threatening, tallying eight bout victories against Harvard fencers. Even then, the Crimson had 19 wins of its own for the 19-8 triumph after trumping Boston College by a 24-3 score the previous year.
Though Harvard failed to beat last year’s performance by purely numerical standards—the Crimson had a total bout score of 66-15 in 2014 and went 62-19 this season—any other negatives from the day were much tougher to spot.
“We talked about not underestimating anyone we see out there because anything can happen,” Yamin said. “Out entire motivation at Ivies was that anything can happen in five-touch bouts, so we definitely carried that with us [to the Beanpot].”
HARVARD MEN’S FENCING
Though the seventh edition of the fencing Beanpot ended with the Crimson hoisting the trophy again, the going was much tougher for Harvard this time around.
With co-captain Duncan O’Brien out with a leg injury sustained in the Crimson’s Ivy League Round Robins victory, the group looked to others on the team for support.
“Once we warmed up, things really started to get going,” junior épéeist Peregrine Badger said. “We ramped the adrenaline back up [from the weekend].... I think in the circumstance we did a very good job today.”
After drubbing Boston College 26-1 in the 2014 edition of the Beanpot, Harvard faced a tougher Eagles squad in 2015. However, the Crimson was consistent in its three matches, dropping Brandeis, the Engineers, and Boston College by scores of 18-9, 19-8, and 19-8, respectively.
The effects of the draining Ivy Round Robins tournament manifested itself in a unique way Wednesday evening—with O’Brien out, junior foilist Michael Woo fenced with the sabré in his stead. Woo also was fighting a hand injury of his own, which prevented him from competing with his usual weapon.
“Watching our guys fence sabré with a foilist’s style was really fun to watch, and [Michael] did very well too.” Badger said.
With Woo fencing with a different weapon, the other three men’s foilists stepped up with solid performances of their own. While many fencing programs carry only three fencers of each weapon, having the fourth foilist has proven to be handy in recent weeks due to the injuries.
“I think our men’s foil program is exceedingly talented...we have more than the three that we absolutely need, and I think that’s paid off a ton, especially given the fact that Michael can’t fence foil right now,” Badger said. “[The other foilists] really picked up the slack and did a great job.”

After three snow days in less than three weeks, Harvard students are experts. And at this point, it seems like the university has given up on the “we’re exceptional enough to go hold class during a blizzard” attitude it had for most of its history, so who knows how many more snow days we’ll have this year? That being said, it’s still important to make the most of every precious day off. Here are some of our favorite ways:
Sledding on the steps of Widener A classic snow day pass time. Steal a tray from the d-hall and make your way over to the Yard. It’s snowed so much that this is a surprisingly safe option. As long as you’re willing to accept the chance that you’ll end up with snow in places you’ve never wanted it, sledding is probably a good option for you.
Never Leave Your RoomThe power hasn’t gone out, so the options are endless. Binge watch on Netflix, binge watch on Hulu, binge watch on HBO Go… something we already do, but snow days take away the guilt you (might) feel about skipping lecture to watch "one last" episode.
Snow-Night OutSnow days are announced early enough to give you plenty of time to bundle up and go out for the night, if you so choose. If you can make it through the snow drifts that are already taller than most of us, the snow days are really just an extension of the weekend. Celebrate having the next day off with your favorite frat or final club.
Catching up on your reading/psets/etc.What we all told ourselves we would do when they announced the first snow day, but is never going to happen. It’s probably best that you just accept that snow days and classwork are mutually exclusive. You can always catch up on reading during reading period, right?
