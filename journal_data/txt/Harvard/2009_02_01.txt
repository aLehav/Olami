After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a report issued last week by US News and World Report that ranked schools according to popularity, Harvard topped the list, defeating all other schools in the top 50 percentile of colleges nationwide. The ranking was based on the percentage of students accepting a school’s offer of admission—otherwise known as a school’s yield—and Harvard’s figure of 76.2 percent set the mark last year. This ranking list is the latest in a series published by US News. Harvard was also recently ranked first in the “National Universities” category of US News’s Best Colleges 2009. Despite the favorable recognition these distinctions are meant to convey, they provide distorted information to prospective students and potentially influence admissions office decisions at colleges trying to game the rankings. For this reason, Harvard should remove itself from the publication’s annual rankings and use its reputation to encourage high school students to rely more on their own research and less on standardized rankings.In the current era of college admissions, with applications rising and acceptance rates plummeting at schools across the country, US News rankings provide an inaccurate representation of school quality that influences far too many students. As admissions get more competitive, prospective applicants apply to an increasing number of schools, and as a result have relied more and more on these rankings. The central role that these rankings play, however, can lead students to make their college decision based on a superficial ranking rather than by determining which school is the best match. This is especially true in the case of the yield statistic, which Dean Fitzsimmons commented was a “slippery figure in many ways,” and is not a good indicator of a school’s popularity or whether it is a good fit for students. Instead of referring to these rankings, students should do their own research and take into consideration available statistics such as acceptance rates, in addition to other factors such as campus visits, when making college decisions.The influential role of US News and World Report’s rankings stems from the nearly universal participation of schools in the United States, as only a handful of institutions choose to remove themselves from ranking consideration each year. Despite an increase in the number of schools opting out of the publication’s annual rankings, the majority of these are less well-known institutions than Harvard, and as a result the authority of US News has not been called into question on a national scale. Harvard should use its name and influence to diminish the importance of these rankings by removing itself from them, an action that would certainly have an effect on the way in which potential applicants view these rankings nationwide. Moreover, Harvard’s position as one of the nation’s preeminent universities would inspire other schools to follow suit, in the same way that Harvard’s financial aid initiative last year inspired Yale and Stanford, among others, to implement similar policies.The world of higher education is so diverse that ranking schools according to a standardized system fails to provide an accurate representation of many schools. These rankings have become increasingly important in many applicants’ decisions, and likely lead to students to make decisions that are not in their best academic interests. While Harvard should remove itself from these rankings, it should continue to provide applicants with information to make them informed about the college application process. In the end, all students are going to rely upon statistics in some capacity when making the college decisions—Harvard should ensure that this information is available and accurate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past few weeks, Slumdog Millionaire has become nothing short of a worldwide sensation, earning a jaw-dropping 10 Oscar nominations and grossing far more than anyone imagined the movie would. The film has been honored by the Screen Actors Guild, the Golden Globes, and the Producers Guild. On Friday, its director, Danny Boyle, received a prize from the Directors Guild, an honor that usually foreshadows an Oscar for best director.
The adulation for the movie is much deserved. It reminded me more than a bit of the 2005 film Crash—heartfelt and vivid, if contrived at times. But these minor flaws are overshadowed by the unfair and worrisome criticism that has been aimed at it by many Indians. Most of the disapproval focuses not on what makes the movie weak (the farcical plot and mediocre character development) but on what makes it strong (the gritty emphasis on the desperately poor country that is still modern India).
A number of Indians, led by prominent Bollywood figures, have condemned the movie for depicting India as a poor, dirty, lawless, and backward nation. Amitabh Bachchan, perhaps Bollywood’s most successful living actor, said that the movie “causes pain and disgust among nationalists and patriots” because of its unwarranted portrayal of India as a “Third World dirty underbelly developing nation.”
First, it must be said that most of those objecting to Slumdog, the immensely wealthy who have shown little concern for India’s poor, have virtually no credibility on this issue. Poverty may be far removed from their Indian experiences, but a different world exists not far from their pampered villas. Indeed, Bombay’s own Dharavi slum, home to one million people, is just miles from the Bollywood studios that so regularly exclude any mention of those who have been left behind. Second, it’s clear that Bachchan and his ilk have thought little about what it means to actually produce art, a self-evident fact given the state of most Bollywood films. While there is hardly agreement about the “purpose” of art—if art has a “purpose” at all—the raging debate for the past half century has been about whether art should serve as a medium of protest or simply a psychologically-credible reflection of society. The writer James Baldwin famously upbraided some novelists for producing work that he considered too long on protest and too short on narrative.
If I had a criticism of Slumdog, that would be it. It leans too heavily on this time-honored protest model, one summed up by Crash’s director, Paul Haggis, when he said in his 2005 Oscar acceptance speech that, “Art is not a mirror to hold up to society, but a hammer with which to shape it.” 
While Slumdog does succumb to this weakness, it compares favorably to the average Bollywood flick, which lacks both narrative credibility and discernible substance. The result is that a nation with so many challenges and so vibrant a film culture produces so many movies that feature meaningless plots punctuated only by feel-good song-and-dance routines. Indeed, it’s not that the movies fail to penetrate the surface—it’s that they don’t even capture it. And so it has fallen to talented British producers to make movies that actually bring India to life, as the estimable Richard Attenborough did in 1982 when he made Gandhi.
Apart from the renewed focus on India’s struggling underclasses, I hope that the lasting legacy of Slumdog is that it inspires a new generation of Bollywood producers to produce films that are at once psychologically credible and socially substantive. Decades ago, this happened regularly. The legendary Indian director Raj Kapoor reached his pinnacle by traversing the forbidden lines of religion, class, and sexuality in a movie about the romance between a wealthy Hindu boy and a poor Christian girl.
For Bachchan, perhaps a more constructive activity than trying to discredit Slumdog is to make a movie like it himself. As it stands, those who think that “pain and disgust” are the appropriate reactions for India’s “nationalists and patriots” are simply abrogating their responsibilities, then complaining when others pick them up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In December 2008, Judge Keith Rollins’ arrest of Lisa (Miedah) Valentine at the Douglasville Municipal Court for wearing her hijab, a religious covering, sparked national debate over whether or not Muslim women and others should be allowed to wear their symbols of faith in the courtroom. As absurd as it is that this kind of debate even occurs in the United States—a country supposedly founded on the principle of religious freedom—the real issue at hand is not one of mere “tolerance.” Valentine and others’ right to wear religious head coverings in public should not even be a point of contestation. 
First and foremost, the Valentine case is especially disturbing from a Constitutional standpoint. The free exercise of one’s religion is guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, and the First and 14th Amendments have governed the state’s ability to interfere with religious practice since at least the middle of the 19th century. There is more than just a textual significance to these amendments. Some historians have argued that the pursuit of religious freedom by persecuted minorities—including but not limited to the Protestant denominations that dominate our national headlines today—was the impetus for widespread emigration from Western Europe during the 17th and  18th centuries. 
Judge Rollins’ conduct is especially inexcusable given the local statutes in question. Canon 3, Section B5 of the Georgia Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judges from being religiously biased, and a Georgia’s Council of Municipal Court Judges brochure mandates that even hats should not be taken off if worn for religious purposes.   As Marc D. Stern wrote on behalf of the American Jewish Congress about this incident, “I have appeared at counsel’s table in the U.S. Supreme Court several times wearing a religious head-covering…I am reasonably confident that wearing such symbols does not disrupt the processes of justice.”
This is not Judge Rollins’ first attempt to curb the free exercise of religious practice in the courtroom. In 2007, he prevented another Muslim woman from entering the courtroom with her hijab. And last year, Halimah Abdullah spent a day in jail for not removing her head covering in Rollin’s courtroom. Nor is the discriminatory treatment limited to women or even the Muslim population as a whole. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) addressed another such case of a Muslim woman in Valdosta last year, and Jasmeen Nanda, a Sikh man wearing a turban, and Rabbi Friedman, a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke, were also told to remove their religious headgear in the courtroom.  
Aside from the abstract and Constitutional issues underlying the case, there is a simple lack of evidence at hand for Valentine’s arrest. Considering her reason for appearing in front of the court—a minor traffic violation—it is mystifying why the bailiff and other law enforcement officials would treat her like a criminal and drag her in front of a judge. More disturbing than this arrest is the ex post facto change in the charges brought against Valentine—somehow, a procedural violation (no headgear in the courtroom) became a real criminal charge (fighting with an officer). This charge was not only proven false by later investigation, but was totally unwarranted in the first place. Nor was Valentine’s sentence—a ten-day jail sentence and a mandate to remove her headscarf outside of the courtroom—appropriate. Asking a Muslim woman or an Orthodox Jewess to remove her headscarf in public is like asking her to disrobe or to expose herself. In an appalling misuse of the judicial system’s power, Valentine was asked to do so by a judge and police officers who have sworn to uphold the law to the best of their abilities.
Official reaction has been swift but relatively benign. Judge Rollins and city court workers will now undergo sensitivity training to prevent such incidents from occurring again. While this is a good measure to prevent future incidents, more needs to be done in the specific incident. Judge Rollins and the law enforcement officers in question should be charged with real disciplinary violations, not simply coddled and warned. 
There is hope that this issue will someday be addressed in its entirety. Georgia Attorney General Thurbert E. Baker has already written a letter to CAIR supporting the principle of religious accommodation in our courtrooms; he should follow up on his support for First Amendment rights by sanctioning or censuring Judge Rollins. The Department of Justice has also stated that it will look into this case; hopefully, its response will be unequivocal in its support for Valentine. 
As the United States attempts to repair its image with Muslims around the world, it is imperative that our deeds match up to our lofty aspirations. Our society’s respect for religious freedom should be beyond reproach; the Valentine case has simply demonstrated that there is still much work left to be done.

The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team suffered its first loss of the season, falling to archrival Princeton, 193-160, in the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet.  With the Crimson’s 251-102 victory over Yale, Harvard finished its dual-meet season registering an 8-1 overall, 6-1 Ivy record.The Crimson’s main focus for the two-day double dual meet was the Tigers, with whom they remained neck and neck for the entire weekend. Harvard led Princeton 96-90 at the end of Saturday’s competition at Blodgett pool, with both teams swapping the lead throughout the course of Sunday.“The effort was definitely there,” junior distance swimmer Alex Meyer said.  “We stayed positive the whole way through, but we’ve just got to work on some skills over the next month.”Meyer claimed two of Harvard’s seven first-place finishes, winning the 500-yard and 1650-yard freestyle with times of 4:22.83 and 15:00.13, respectively. These times were good enough to earn Meyer NCAA “B” cut in both events.Sophomore Blake Lewkowitz and senior co-captain Eric Lynch also posted NCAA “B” times in the 1650 freestyle.  Lynch recorded two additional NCAA “B” times throughout the two-day contest, finishing second in the 200-yard freestyle and fourth in the 500-yard freestyle.Senior co-captain David Guernsey also helped boost Harvard’s score, capturing himself a NCAA “B” cut in the 200-yard freestyle with a first-place time of 1:36.16.The Crimson’s medley relay teams picked up two victories for Harvard, with both recording NCAA “B” times. In the 200-yard medley relay, sophomore Jordan Diekema, junior Simone Melillo, senior Bill Jones and Guernsey touched the wall in 1:28.52. The foursome also competed together in the 400 yard medley relay, emerging victorious with a 3:14.18 time.Diekema shone in the individual events as well. Battling sickness all week, Diekema overcame this obstacle to finish first in the 200-yard backstroke in 1:45.16.  The sophomore also placed second in the 100-yard backstroke, falling only to Yale senior standout Alex Righi.On the board, sophomore Zac Ranta blew away the competition in the one-meter dive, finishing with a score of 288.05 points.  Ranta also came in third in the three-meter dive, barely passed by Yale’s Drew Teer and Princeton’s Daniel Dickerson.“Overall at this meet we showed a lot of improvement and we showed where we can be in the next four weeks,” Guernsey said.  “As a team I think we really came together and accomplished something.”But the Crimson has many more improvements to make.  The team will look for revenge as it faces its rivals once again in early March for the Ivy League championship meet in the Tigers’ home pool.“We just need to train a lot during the next few weeks and focus on becoming a better team over the next month,” Lynch said.  “We lost some races in a few key spots, which is okay because we have four weeks until the conference meet and we can make a lot of improvements and win those races.”Junior freestyle swimmer Tyler Holland, who competed in five of the contest’s events, is also optimistic.“Princeton should be terrified that that was even a close meet,” Holland said.Harvard will begin its championship meet season at home, when it hosts the ECAC championships at the end of the month.—Staff writer Alexandra J.

It was an all-for-one mentality at Blodgett Pool this weekend for the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team, but in the end, the team effort fell just short.Powered by a few individual stars, Princeton (6-0, 6-0 Ivy) held off the Crimson (6-1, 6-1), 170.5-148.5, in head-to-head competition at the annual HYP double-dual meet. Harvard handily beat Yale (5-4, 3-3), 232-87.“We swam absolutely the best that we could swim,” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said. “We had a game plan and we executed it. You can’t control what the other team does.”Harvard got individual wins from sophomores Kate Mills and Katy Hinkle and freshman Meghan Leddy, and despite often getting three or four swimmers to the wall before the Tigers’ second finisher, the sheer volume of Princeton wins was too much to overcome.“Anyone who was watching the meet saw…that we were a team,” Morawski said. “Swimming as fast as we did and staying that close to Princeton without getting the wins—that was the group effort.”The Crimson’s distance freestylers exemplified that group effort. Though Tiger Alicia Aemisegger, who earned All-American honors in three events at NCAAs last year, easily won both the 500-yard and 1000-yard freestyle events, Harvard took the next four spots in each event.Junior co-captain Alexandra Clarke, sophomore Christine Kaufmann, junior Katie Faulkner, and freshman Catherine Zagroba made up the Crimson’s distance corps. “In my four years [at HYP] I’ve never seen a team come together and have so much energy,” co-captain Kelly Mooney said. “It was fun to see the middle-distance and distance swimmers feeding off of each other and doing what it takes to get best times and score for our team.”Mills had another typically outstanding meet, setting a new school record in the 200-yard freestyle on Friday night. Her time of 1:47.42 put her in second place behind Princeton freshman Jillian Altenburger and earned her an NCAA “B” cut. Mills won the 100-yard butterfly in 55.52, made another “B” cut in the 200-yard butterfly (1:58.57), and anchored Harvard’s winning 400-yard freestyle relay team.Hinkle led an all-sophomore sweep of the 50-yard freestyle, winning the race in 23.45. Ali Slack (23.74) and Laura Murray (24.15) followed, with classmate Holly Furman (24.29) placing fifth.Leddy and fellow freshman Margaret Fish went 1-2 in the 200-yard backstroke, touching the wall in 2:01.58 and 2:03.41, respectively. Junior Kay Foley was fourth in 2:05.86. Harvard’s final win came in the meet’s last event, the 400-yard freestyle relay, and was another top-two sweep for the Crimson. Hinkle, Murray, freshman Ali Lightbourne, and Mills finished in 3:24.89, and the team of Slack, Furman, freshman Monica Burgos, and Fish placed second with a time of 3:28.74.“I think we ended on a great note, winning the last relay,” Mills said. “They only gained two points on us in one day—we’re not going to give up just because we’re 20 points behind. We’re ready to see them again at Ivies.”Junior Sophie Morgan also put up some impressive performances, coming out of the third heat to take second (55.57) in the 100-yard butterfly. She was third in the 200-yard butterfly and fourth in the 200-yard individual medley. “She went out there and raced everything and just decided that she was going to do it,” Morawski said. “It was just really nice to see her swim so fast right now.”Though this weekend’s loss brought an end to the Crimson’s campaign for an undefeated dual-meet season, the team’s focus is now squarely on the Ivy League Championships at the end of this month. With the different scoring format of a championship meet, Harvard’s deep pool of talent just may be enough to overtake the Tigers’ superstars.“We’re more confident because if the meet was scored the way the Ivy meet is scored, we would have won,” Mooney said. “The Ivy meet favors depth, so we’re going into Ivies knowing that we can win and [we’re] very comfortable as the underdogs, ready to chase.”“We have unbelievable depth and as such it would have been nice to win today, but you pick and choose what your focus is,” Morawski said. “They want to be Ivy League champions, and that’s what we’re going for.”The Crimson will be back in the pool on Feb. 13 for a final tune-up against cross-town rival Northeastern.—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kdleist@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard fencing team closed out its warm-up to the Ivy season with wins over Haverford, Yeshiva, and Duke yesterday at MIT. In the last meet before the two-week Ivy Championships,  the women (14-1) put in a dominant performance, defeating the Fords 21-6, the Maccabees 25-2, and the Blue Devils 18-9. The men got back on track with victories of 25-2 over Yeshiva, 16-11 over Haverford, and 15-12 over Duke.“It’s nice to have this meet to make sure we’re tuned up and ready to go,” co-captain Emily Cross said. “The guys fenced really well, it was a good confidence booster. So we’re definitely looking forward to next weekend, and we’re right in the place that we need to be.”The foil led the way yet again for a women’s squad that has yet to disappoint. Cross, junior co-captain Arielle Pensler, freshman Shelby MacLeod, and junior Anna Podolsky lost just one bout on the day, and the four will need to continue to shine if the Crimson hopes to have any success against powerhouses like Columbia next weekend.“Our team is definitely one of the stronger teams out there,” Cross said. “[Harvard coach Peter Brand has] been doing a great job recruiting. It’s good that we’re able to help out the team as much as we have been. Certainly we’re looking forward to a good Ivy match for the foil squad.”“Our women’s foil squad is probably the overall best in the country,” Brand said. “We’ve defeated every top school except Notre Dame, but based on the record, I think we have the best foil squad in the country.”The foil got some help from three other outstanding performances. The épée set the tone, with rookie Noam Mills and senior Maria Larsson posting undefeated afternoons. But no one was more exciting to watch than freshman Caroline Vloka. The heart of the sabre team, the rookie lost only one bout—to Rebecca Ward of Duke, the number one ranked fencer in the world, who won a bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics. Vloka had been up 4-2 in the bout before succumbing to a questionable final touch to lose 5-4.The men got quite a bit of help from their ever-steady walk-ons against the Maccabees, including sophomores Wes Talcott and Nick Culbertson.“My philosophy is that I strongly believe that the walk-ons and the ones that stick with us should have an opportunity to fence,” Brand said. “This is one of those days I thought we could afford to do that, and they presented themselves extremely well.”Against the Blue Devils, and even against Haverford, things didn’t go quite so smoothly—it came down to the final two épée bouts against the Fords.“We’ve been struggling, there’s no doubt about it,” Brand said. “We’re not as good as we were two, three years ago.”Co-captain and épée fencer Benji Ungar continued his strong comeback from injury losing just once on the day, and co-captain and foil fencer Kai Itameri-Kinter posted the same mark.“Kai is very resilient, very durable, and extremely dependable,” Brand said. “It’s his senior year, it’s going to be tough to lose him.”Freshman Valentin Staller continued to shine for the sabre, but also got some unexpected help from senior Scott DiGiulio.“The other starter that I think is coming out of his funk is Scott DiGiulio, who came on very strong,” Brand said. “He’s been struggling all year, and today was one of those days where it looks like he’s coming out of it and fencing as well as he can.” —Staff writer Madeleine I.

Home sweet home.Under the leadership of first year head coach Brian Baise, the Harvard men’s volleyball team landed its first victory of the season over the Stevens Institute in its home opener at the Malkin Athletic Center on Saturday. After dropping its first contest to the fourth-ranked Ducks, the Crimson came out ahead in the next three games for a 3-1 win overall (23-30, 32-30, 30-27, 30-27).“Once we had a game under our belt we felt a lot more comfortable,” junior co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “We have a home crowd and we use it to our advantage. Once we started rolling, the Crimson in motion stays in motion.”In the first game, Stevens dominated both sides of the court, posting a .600 attacking percentage and jumping up for seven blocks. After nabbing an early lead, the Ducks kept up its momentum to shut down the Crimson, 30-23.“Despite the statistics, they play a very different tempo than we’re used to,” senior co-captain Brady Weissbourd said. “They hit 600, but a lot of it was sort of tips and off-tempo stuff. They did catch us off our guard. It took us a game to adapt and be on our toes.  [But] the next three games were great.”Harvard rallied in the second contest, starting off with an 8-5 lead over Stevens. But the Crimson couldn’t break away, and both teams remained neck and neck, keeping within two points of each other for most of the set. With the game tied at 22, Harvard finally shot ahead, capitalizing on Stevens’s errors to secure the lead, 27-22. The Ducks managed to narrow the scoring gap to 28-26, but Weissbourd slammed down a kill to take the Crimson to game point, 29-26.“[Brady]’s our anchor,” Weintraub said. “He uses his height and his skill to his advantage. He’s pretty much unstoppable.”But Stevens wouldn’t give up without a fight and tied the score at 29, sending the game into extra points. Another pair of Duck errors doomed Stevens’s offensive efforts, and Harvard nailed the win, 32-30. In addition to Weissbourd’s five kills, freshman Nikola Ivica slammed down five of his own to lead Harvard in the second set.“Nikola is a big dude…he’s about 6’6 on the outside,” Weintraub said. “As long as I do my job right there’s nothing stopping him. He’s got all the shots.”The Crimson’s offensive momentum carried into the third set, as it seized an early 6-3 lead over the Ducks. Stevens trimmed the margin to one point, 8-7, but Harvard kept up the fight and battled to a 30-27 victory.The Crimson continued its dominance in the fourth set, opening the contest with a 4-0 run. Both teams traded points until the Ducks pulled ahead to 10-9, but Stevens’s scoring advantage didn’t last long, as Harvard reclaimed the momentum, 13-12. The lead changed hands again when the Ducks slipped ahead to a 19-18 advantage. But the Crimson took control of the lead one last time and held on for the win, 30-27.Although the Ducks managed to outblock Harvard, 13.5-10 overall, and recorded higher hitting percentages in three out of four games, Stevens’s 18 service errors hindered its performance and assisted the Crimson in its offensive onslaught. Harvard, on the other hand, slammed down seven service aces and only had 13 service errors overall.Ivica led the team with 22 kills and 10 digs overall, while Weissbourd tallied 19 kills and seven digs. Freshman Matt Jones recorded 12 kills and six digs, and junior Erik Kuld notched 10 kills and seven digs. Junior co-captain Gil Weintraub anchored the offense with 63 assists.Harvard returns to the Malkin Athletic Center to face NYU on Friday and East Stroudsburg on Saturday in its first conference events.“[This win] bodes well for us because Stevens took down NYU twice already fairly easily,” Weintraub said. “I think the fact that we matched up well against Stevens bodes well that we’ll match up against NYU as well.”—Staff writer Courtney D.

Although Cornell won on the women’s side and Connecticut captured the men’s crown, the Harvard co-ed track and field team posted impressive individual performances at Saturday’s Harvard Select Meet at Gordon Track.“We had some really good performances,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “The team scores are a little misleading because our lineup was a little different. Our approach this year is really about building. I’m just really pleased with where we’re at.”Never failing to impress, women’s co-captain Becky Christensen topped her personal best in the high jump with a 1.86-meter leap—improving from 1.85, which she set earlier this year at the Harvard Open. Christensen’s jump cleared the NCAA automatic qualifier, which guarantees that she will be competing on the national level in mid-March in College Station, Tex.“I was really happy that I was able to jump really well,” Christensen said. “I had my good mark from our second meet in December, but it makes me feel really confident that I didn’t lose anything over the break and that I’m getting better.” Sophomore Hilary May, fresh off her victory in the 3K at the NYU Metro Coaches Invitational three weeks ago, picked up another win—this time in the one-mile run—with a time of 4:58.44. The finish put her a full two seconds ahead of the next runner and qualifies May for the ECAC Championships in March.Rookie Kailyn Kuzmuk edged out the Big Red’s Fiona Cundy in the 3K with a time of 9:55.14 for first place and an ECAC qualifier, while senior Shannon Flahive picked up a win in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.71—another ECAC qualifying time. Flahive was beat out by Cornell’s Jeomi Maduka for first in the long jump and finished back-to-back with freshman Lauren Leon in the 200-meter dash. Flahive came in sixth with a time of 25.86, while Leon followed in seventh with a 26.64 finish.Newcomer Magda Robak took a fifth-place finish in the 400-meter dash at 59.00, while sophomore Katrina Drayton placed ninth at 1:00.21 and junior Kathryn Orchowski finished 13th at 1:01.18.In the 800-meter run, women’s co-captain Aishlinn O’Callaghan finished 10th, clocking in at 2:21.42.The distance medley team captured the win with a time of 12:01.75, while the 4x400-meter relay squad finished second to Cornell with a time of 4:01.53. Freshman Stacey Jung and sophomore Paige Martin finished second and third in the pole vault, matching each other with 3.05-meter bounds—Martin did so using more attempts, placing her at the three spot.Senior Dara Wilson was the Crimson’s sole competitor in the triple jump, finishing 10th with a jump of 9.91 meters, and freshman Lauren Barber provided the lone Harvard showing in the weight throw competition, launching the weight 12.55 meters to place eighth.On the men’s side, freshman Nico Weiler, who wasted no time proving himself by winning the pole vault event in December’s Husky Invitational, cleared the 4.80-meter bar on Saturday to capture first place in the event and earn himself an IC4A qualifier.“Nico is obviously a pretty special talent,” Saretsky said of Weiler, who came to Harvard having already competed on the international stage. “His work ethic and his intensity to this sport are a testament to his success.”Fellow rookie Steven Geloneck took sixth in the 60-meter dash, with a time of 7.03, while senior Derek Jones and freshman Chukwuma Ogunwole placed eighth and 13th in the 200-meter dash, finishing at 23.19 and 23.59, respectively.In the 400-meter dash, junior Justin Grinstead finished fifth, with a time of 49.98, while newcomer Brian Paison took 10th in the 800-meter run at 1:55.85.Freshman Dan Stiles, junior Vito Cannavo, and sophomores Mark Hirschboeck and Alex Brenner all competed in the one-mile run. Stiles finished ninth at 4:23.17, Cannavo was 11th with 4:24.93, Hirschboeck was 12th with 4:25.25, and Brenner was 14th with 4:29.79.A trio of Harvard runners placed in the men’s 3K, with newcomer Michael Hoffman coming in fifth at 8:38.46, sophomore Ryan Neely placing seventh at 8:40.80, and junior Stephen Chester crossing the line ninth at 8:57.10.Freshmen Phil Ngo and Jacques Barjon finished back-to-back in the long jump with respective 6.53- and 6.52-meter bounds to place sixth and seventh.Junior Jack Brady launched the shot 15.36 meters to earn sixth, while senior Neville Irani and sophomores Ablorde Ashigbi and Eric Clayman all finished  top-10 in the weight throw, with throws of 16.90 meters (fourth place), 15.99 meters (seventh), and 15.85 meters (eighth), respectively.The Crimson now heads into its final two meets before Heptagonals—with one of those meets being the always-exciting Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, taking place at Gordon Track in two weeks.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard skiing team headed north in search of fresh powder this weekend, racing to a 10th place finish at the University of New Hampshire Winter Carnival in Jackson, N.H.. Both the Nordic and Alpine teams had their share of struggles and success in the teams’ second event of the season. Powerhouse Dartmouth maintained its dominance, finishing 67 points ahead of runner-up New Hampshire.“A couple of us weren’t happy [with our results], but at the same time, we were definitely glad to get some good skiing in,” junior Aubrey Mangan said.Junior captain Christopher Kinner placed 30th in the men’s Giant Slalom event, posting times of 1:11.16 in his first attempt and 1:10.96 in his second. Behind him was freshman Kevin McNamara, who placed 46th, with a total time of 2:25.74. Rounding out the field of competitors were sophomores Brad Alvarez and Alec Boardman, finishing in 2:36.17 and 2:39.82, respectively. Kinner and McNamara both improved their standings in the Slalom event. Kinner finished a respectable 22nd with his best-ever time of 1:32.76. In fact, Kinner was only half a second behind the leader in his second run. McNamara also competed well, finishing with a time of 1:35.37 and a 36th place finish. “Kevin McNamara has outstanding potential,” sophomore Alec Boardman said. “He’s definitely going have a good four years ahead of him.”With the women’s alpine team captain out due to injury, the team struggled against other competition in both the Giant Slalom and Slalom events. In the Giant Slalom, freshman Caroline McHugh fell in her second run after posting a time of 1:23:33, earning no points for the team. In the Slalom, McHugh managed to complete her two runs, but finished 49th with an overall time of 2:00.11. The men’s Classic Sprints event featured junior Trevor Petatch, who paved the way for the Crimson with a time of 3:49.20. Right behind Petatch was senior Dave McCahill, clocking in just four seconds later. The men’s Nordic team also competed in the 10K Free event. As in the classic sprints, Petatch and McCahill struggled once again to finish in the top half of the pack. They finished 60th and 71st respectively. Similarly, the women’s Nordic team had its share of struggles on the slopes in both the Classic Sprints and the 10K Free. Sophomore Cara Sprague had arguably the best showing this weekend for Harvard, completing the classic sprints with an impressive time of 4:30.27, garnering a 34th place finish out of a total of 84 competitors. Just ten places behind her was Mangan, with a time of 4:35.48. Also representing the Crimson women’s Nordic team were sophomore Alyssa Devlin (4:35.52), senior captain Anna Schultz (4:44.47), freshman Shannon Mulshine (4:46.56) and sophomore Meri Burruss (5:12.42).“We all skied really fast, some of us faster than last year, but the women’s field has gotten a lot faster this year,” Mangan said. Wrapping up this weekend’s carnival was the women’s 10K Free. Devlin finished in the middle of the pack with a time of 33:45.41, while Mangan, Sprague, Mulshine, Shultz, and Burruss finished in 56th, 57th, 65th, 70th, and 77th place, respectively. Harvard won’t have much time to rest, as it prepares to gear up for the Vermont Carnival next weekend. “We just have to get some more training under our belts, build on what we’ve done so far, and just go from there,” Boardman said.“Hopefully, we’ll have a good race next week.”—Staff writer Kevin T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early struggles have made the Harvard women’s hockey team’s quest for dominance within its conference and high standing in the national rankings an uphill battle this season.But the Crimson’s frustrating bouts with inconsistency have come to an end, and Harvard appears to be back on the rise.The Crimson (10-7-3, 10-4-2 ECAC) completed a two-game sweep on the road this weekend, routing Union (2-23-3, 0-15-1), 5-1, on Friday before holding on against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) (12-12-3, 7-7-2) for a 5-4 victory on Saturday.Despite not having its leading scorer in tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, Harvard’s offensive attack was irrepressible against the Dutchwomen, overwhelming Union with a 48-shot barrage.The following day against the Engineers, the Crimson seemed to be heading for yet another blowout, but RPI made things interesting in the third period, nearly climbing back from a 5-2 deficit before eventually falling.On the whole, Harvard coach Katey Stone was pleased with her team’s efforts, especially since the Crimson had not played in nearly three weeks because of final exams.“We’re coming together,” Stone said. “Everybody got some great opportunities. “We’re ready to come out of the gate with a lot of energy.”HARVARD 5, RPI 4Harvard’s contest against RPI on Saturday had all the makings of a blowout. The Crimson scored the first four goals of the game and built a 5-2 lead three minutes into the third period, putting the game seemingly out of reach.But the Engineers refused to go down easily, clawing their way back into the game by catching Harvard off guard with two late goals.“[The Engineers] never give up,” Stone said. “They play hard and smart and their goaltender did well. You have to learn to bury teams like that.”The Crimson did learn, in fact, and just in time. After RPI’s Melissa Boik brought her team within one with her goal 18 minutes into the third period, Harvard finally clamped down on defense for the game’s final two minutes, keeping the Engineers at bay and preventing them from pulling their goalie.“I think we just settled in,” Crimson tri-captain Jenny Brine said. “We started really focusing on our defensive zone.”Brine contributed two assists in the game, both to Vaillancourt, who returned to the Harvard squad from the Team Canada’s week-long training camp in Calgary, Alta.Vaillancourt’s time with her country’s national team seemed to pay off. The senior scored two goals against RPI while adding an assist.“She’s one of the leaders of our team,” Stone said. “She can ignite a lot of energy and make a lot of good things.”But while Vaillancourt led the scoring for the Crimson, it was sophomore Liza Ryabkina’s third period tally—which gave the team a seemingly comfortable 5-2 lead—that turned out to be the most essential in Harvard’s victory effort.“In retrospect it was huge for us,” Brine said.HARVARD 5, UNION 1Despite not having Vaillancourt, the Crimson had no problem disposing of the last-place Dutchwomen on Friday.Harvard unleashed 48 shots on Union, while allowing only six on its own goal.Brine led the Crimson, kicking off her stellar weekend with a one-goal, three-assist effort.“She’s great,” Stone said. “Every day she’s getting stronger.”Sophomore Katharine Chute also came up big for Harvard, scoring twice—both times off Brine assists—while adding a helper of her own.Chute benefited from a promotion up to the Crimson’s top line, where she hasn’t seen action since last season. Pairing Chute and Brine paid off, as the two collaborated on three of Harvard’s five goals.“She’s taken a step forward,” Stone said of Chute. “We’re able to utilize her strengths—her speed and shot”Harvard has lit the lamp five times in three of its last four games, indicating that the offensive woes the Crimson experienced earlier in the season are all but over.“I think we’ve always known that it’s been there,” Brine said. “We have the ability to score five goals a game, and it was nice to have people stepping up and putting the puck away.”This recent run of success bodes well for Harvard, which is just three points out of first place in the ECAC but faces some of the toughest teams in the nation in the coming weeks.“I think we’ve made great strides, especially over exam period,” Brine said. “As we head into this last stretch we have everything to gain.”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 47 Harvard men’s tennis team opened its regular season with a mixed performance this weekend, losing, 7-0, to No. 8 Tennessee on Saturday but bouncing back to beat No. 52 Drake, 4-3, yesterday at the ITA Regional Team Tournament in Knoxville, TN.
Given that the Crimson was slowed by injuries at the top of its lineup, with No. 53 co-captain Chris Clayton—who typically plays at No. 1—and sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien out because of injuries, the weekend’s mixed result is one the team can be proud of.
“We held our own with a depleted lineup,” sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans said. “That’s a great testament to the depth of our lineup.”
HARVARD 4, DRAKE 3
Just a day after being shut out by a top-ten team, the Harvard’s hope to redeem its first weekend of play rested on the back of its least experienced player, freshman Alistair Felton. 
Up 3-2 overall in the match, Felton and co-captain Mike Kalfayan were the last two Crimson singles players on the court. Playing at No. 5, Felton capitalized on his opportunity to bring home the victory and clinch Harvard’s first dual match win, breaking his opponent at 2-2 in the first set and never looking back.
“I had to keep being aggressive without giving him cheap points,” Felton said of his eventual 6-2, 6-3 win. “I was trying to attack his backhand—which was his weakest shot—and use that to open up the court.”
Kalfayan could not pull through a victory in his match, losing 6-1, 6-4 after the overall match had been clinched.
Harvard brought the match score to 3-2 on the strength of singles wins from No. 2 Chijoff-Evans (7-6(5), 6-2) and No. 3 junior Michael Hayes (6-2, 7-6(5)). Hayes and Chijoff-Evans’ 8-5 win in doubles also helped the Crimson seal the singles point.
“[Hayes] has really raised his game to another level,” assistant coach Andy Rueb ’95 said.
If Felton clinched the match and Chijoff-Evans and Hayes kept the ball rolling forward for the Crimson, then the No. 1 doubles duo of senior Sasha Ermakov and freshman Davis Mangham put Harvard back on the right course after Saturday’s loss to Tennessee with an easy 8-4 victory. 
“Sasha has played at the top level,” Rueb said. “He did a great job taking control, helping Davis make the right moves at the right time.”
NO. 8 TENNESSEE 7, HARVARD 0
A top-ten team proved too much for Harvard to handle in its first dual match since the NCAA’s in May. Better conditioned and better accustomed to playing, the Volunteers (3-0) systematically dismantled the Crimson.
“They were just a little more polished than we were,” Rueb said. “They were a little sharper. ”
Except for Chijoff-Evans’ three-setter (4-6, 6-3, 6-0), all of Harvard’s losses came in straight sets.
“With the way he played against Tennessee, Alexei proved he can play with anyone in the country,” Rueb said. “If he gets his conditioning a little bit better, he’ll be a national force this spring.”
Indeed, conditioning—rather than raw skill—proved the determining factor in Harvard’s loss. 
“Against Tennessee, we proved that we have the shot making abilities,” Chijoff-Evans said. “It’s just a matter about being able to physically sustain that type of play for hours.”

Harvard wrestling isn’t looking for excuses, just wins.The Crimson grapplers dropped a frustrating match against crosstown rival Boston Univesity at Case Gymnasium Saturday night, falling 40-8 in their fifth straight dual loss.Harvard (1-8, 0-2 EIWA) has continued to struggle in the absence of junior co-captain Louis Caputo (184 lbs.) and sophomore Corey Jantzen (141), but head coach Jay Weiss has no interest in self-pity.“I don’t care who’s in or out, the occasion has to be met,” Weiss said. “I’m not one to look at the score, I’m more concerned with the effort, but we didn’t compete hard.”Junior co-captain J.P. O’Connor echoed his coach’s assessment, making a note of the need for improvement.“It was tough outing,” he said. “Everything that could have gone wrong did, and we just wrestled poorly. We’re going to try to put [the BU match] behind us very quickly.”The Crimson did pick up two wins, but suffered four falls and a major decision in a lopsided defeat to a Terrier team that tied Harvard 21-21 a year ago. Although numerous pins undermined the short-handed squad, senior Tommy Picarsic (133) and O’Connor (157) continued their strong leadership efforts, earning all eight Harvard points with a 6-5 decision and a technical fall respectively.While Picarsic (4-2) has now recorded back-to-back victories twice this season, No. 4 O’Connor has enjoyed sustained brilliance, posting a 16-1 drubbing of Ben Mandelbraut for his 19th win of the year and eighth in a row.“J.P is wrestling really well right now,” Weiss explained. “He’s been strong and he’s making adjustments to the adjustments [opponents] are making on him.”Rather than dwell on his stellar performance, though, O’Connor quickly deflected praise to Picarsic, who has been a rare fixture in the lineup this year.“Tommy has been plagued by injuries himself in the past, but he’s really stepped up [this season],” O’Connor explained. “He’s wrestled very well against a lot of good opponents. He’s come in and given us a bit of a spark at the bottom of the lineup, especially with the forfeit at 125 lbs.”Despite these standout performances–particularly O’Connor’s use of only 4:49 to invoke the technical fall rule–the two grapplers made little impact in a lopsided defeat. After bringing the score to 16-8, the Crimson watched the next five bouts slip away, conceding the match without much drama to an energized home squad.While the coaching staff and players try to focus on the performance of available grapplers, the reality of replacing Caputo and Jantzen has taken its toll, depleting a roster that had received top-25 votes early on in the season during healthier times.Senior Patrick Ziemnik (174), sophomore Michael Sadler (165), and freshman Johnny Motley (133) all shifted up a weight class against the Terriers, creating mismatches throughout the lineup. While Sadler and Motley endured falls against heavier opponents, Ziemnik (0-4) earned accolades from his coach with a strong showing at 184. The veteran grappler matched BU’s Dan Kennedy point-for-point, trailing by a single score with moments remaining in the third period. The Harvard senior allowed his opponent to escape, hoping for a takedown in the final seconds, but he could not upend the redshirt freshman. Nonetheless, the 6-4 decision marked the best effort made by a losing Crimson wrestler and brought much-needed intensity to a lackluster match.“Patrick has been one of our top leaders, not as much in wins as in what he brings to the table,” Weiss said. “It’s not about the record, but about how he competes.”For a team that has lacked its characteristic intensity for consecutive weeks, such performances from veterans suggest Harvard’s potential, but they cannot carry the squad. Weiss expressed a need for some of the younger grapplers to embrace an increased role.“Some younger guys are getting valuable experience and I think they’re ready,” he said. “[Everyone] is doing a great job in training, but it needs to translate to the mat. “We’ll see who steps up after this [loss].”With Ivy League play opening against Princeton and Penn next weekend, the Crimson will look to those returning from injury and those in their first year to turn in more encouraging results.—Staff writer Max N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friday night’s match-up pitting the Penn Quakers against the Harvard Crimson seemed like it might evolve into a classic one-on-one duel.
Junior Jeremy Lin was riding a hot hand, and is on pace to challenge for Ivy League Player of the Year. Penn sophomore Tyler Bernardini is the returning Ivy Rookie of the Year, and he has led the Quakers in scoring this year as well.
The two were matched up on each other defensively for most of the game, and the rivalry had all the potential.
The only problem: both players failed to show up.
Lin had the upper hand, going 5-of-10 from the field to post 13 points to go along with his six assists, but the junior standout failed to convert on multiple attempts at the line, going 2-of-5 from the stripe when it counted most.
Bernardini was even worse, however, tallying only six points and four assists on the night. The sophomore could not even muster a field goal in the second half.
Instead, the Crimson was beat by a guard of lesser stature but maybe more skill—freshman Zach Rosen posted a near double-double with a 15-point, nine assist performance. 
Although he leads the team in assists, his 7.4 points per game average is nothing to write home about. But the team followed his lead on Friday night, and he delivered, getting inside and getting to the line frequently to frustrate the Crimson defense.
“Rosen was tremendous, and he made some critical passes when they needed it,” coach Tommy Amaker said.
His outstanding play was none the more obvious when it counted most. Rosen was able to get to the hoop, draw contact, and make two free throws with the score tied 56-56 with less than two minutes to play. He then sealed the game with two more clutch free throws with 34 second left.
Penn executed at the end, and the Crimson just could not.
“I’m disappointed we didn’t play a little better in the moments we need to gut out a game like this,” Amaker said. “Give credit to Penn, they played very well in stretches.”
BIG MEN ON CAMPUS
With just under nine minutes to play in the game, Amaker decided to go big. He substituted in junior Doug Miller, but left freshman big man Keith Wright in to give the Crimson a lethal one-two combination.
And the big men did not disappoint. After Wright tallied six straight points of his own beginning at the 14 minute mark, the two combined for 14 of the team’s 16 points over the next eight minutes. The two led the Crimson to a lead at 51-50, and after Lin broke their streak with a big three to put Harvard up four, the team looked poised to win.
“Keith and I were able to set some screens and we benefited from the quickness of [Lin and McNally] to score,” Miller said. “It would be great if we could work up there together, and it would definitely improve our effort on the boards.”
But it was not to be, as the squad lapsed in the end game, missing free throws, failing to get back on transition defense, and even allowing a couple of thunder dunks that led Penn to seal the victory.
“Our energy went down a lot in the second half,” Miller said. “[We], as the veterans, have to make sure we keep going as a team.
NOT HOME, SWEET HOME
Last season, the Crimson failed to tally one road win, posting an abysmal 0-12 mark away from Lavietes.
This season, with some tough road wins at UNH, Dartmouth, and of course, over then-No. 24 Boston College, the road monkey is off the team’s proverbial back.
“I think we’re a better basketball team than last year,” Amaker said. “We’ve won some close games, and that’s encouraging, especially on the road.”
But at home—it’s been a different story. The squad has lost two tough overtime contests, against Dartmouth last weekend and Northeastern earlier in the year. The close loss Friday night to Ivy rival Penn stings all the more in light of this trend.
The team will have to find a way to break this home curse, or the season’s high hopes could come crashing down.
“The little last bit, we need to get it done,” Miller said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As he has done for most of the season, junior guard Jeremy Lin led the team offensively in its 76-70 loss at home to Princeton Saturday, this time with a game-high 27 points, the most he has scored in an Ivy League game. During a seven-minute stretch in the second half, he truly left his mark on the game as he scored 14 straight points for Harvard.
Down 41-40 with 15 minutes to play, he hit a floater in the lane to give his team the lead. Several possessions later, he dribbled around and hit a jumper from the key. Then it was a pull-up just inside the arc. Then two free throws, followed by a bank-shot. He followed that with another jumper, then hit both ends of a one-and-one. When his one-man run ended, he had kept the team close, as it led 54-52 with eight-and-a-half minutes left.
“I was trying to stay aggressive and take what the defense gave me,” Lin said. “They had to respect [junior forward] Doug [Miller] down low and had to respect our shooters so the mid-range was wide open and I was able to find a rhythm and take advantage.”
BACK AT IT
In his penultimate game against the Tigers, senior guard Drew Housman turned back the clock to his sophomore season as he put in another solid offensive performance against Princeton.  Back in 2007, he lit them up for 33 points in Jadwin Gym in a crushing double-overtime loss, then scored 20 in a winning effort in the return game at home.
After two nondescript performances last season against the Tigers in which he had just seven points combined, he was back to his best Saturday, scoring 15 points—11 in the second half on perfect 5-of-5 shooting from the floor—in 27 minutes. He also dished out a season-high six assists against just one turnover.
In his games sophomore year, he constantly beat his defenders to the basket for lay-ups and there was more of the same this time, twice beating speedy opponent Doug Davis to the hoop and laying it in. 
“I don’t think Princeton’s guards have ever been able to stay in front of Drew,” Lin said.
His other three baskets came in the last three minutes as he tried to keep it close. He answered Tiger guard Dan Mavraides’ three that put the visitors up six with his own big three, making it 66-63 with 2:13 left. He drove for hoops with 23 and 13 seconds left and his team down six both times, though on the second, he missed the and-one attempt. 
He made just 2-of-5 free throw attempts in the final four-and-a-half minutes of the game, the only blemish on a fine night.
“Drew did a tremendous job breaking their team down, getting into the heart of their defense, making plays, making lay-ups, finding people,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m sure he’ll be the first to tell you he should have shot better from the foul line, but he played a very solid game.”
FOUL TIDINGS
After two miserable foul shooting performances in losses to Dartmouth and Princeton, the Crimson put forth an improved effort from the line Saturday, though it still left something to be desired.
Harvard made 20 of 27 free throws, good for 74.1 percent, an improvement on the 17-of-27 performance last Saturday against the Big Green and much better than the 7-of-16 stinker the previous night against the Quakers. Unlike those two games, the team was perfect in 1-and-1 opportunities, making both shots in all four of those trips.
But not all was well from the stripe as in addition to Housman’s late misses, the team blew four shots in the first half, including a pair by Lin in the final minute that could have ensured the Crimson went into the locker room with a lead.
“We did a better job tonight, but there were misses during key stretches, including when we could have built up our lead,” Amaker said. 
Harvard got many chances to redeem itself at the line as the game was filled with fouls on both teams. Princeton committed 25 fouls, with 12 in the first half and 13 in the second, while the Crimson had eight in the opening frame and 10 more after the break.
“It was definitely physical,” Housman said. “Much different than the out of conference stuff.  It’s something we need to get used to.”
The Tigers went to the line 24 times and hit 19 of them, including all six in the final four minutes. Their junior center Zach Finley was the only player to foul out, though not until he had driven from near halfcourt and threw down a slam over freshman forward Peter Boehm.

At this time last year, the storyline looked just the same for the Harvard men’s hockey team. The Crimson (5-11-4, 5-6-4 ECAC) is starting to rebound after a lengthy winless streak and looks toward the thrill and fanfare of playing in a venerable Boston-sports institution—the 57th Annual Beanpot Tournament—to jumpstart the momentum. In this tournament, featuring the four elite teams of Boston men’s college hockey, a win always carries special significance. The Crimson played two of the most exciting games of its season at last year’s Beanpot, and at this evening’s game against the No. 2 Boston University Terriers, everyone will discover whether Harvard will be able to return to the championship game one week from tonight.“The Beanpot’s importance comes from the fact that it’s the best college hockey tournament in season in the entire country,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “There’s great tradition.  It’s a great venue and there’s such great history with the four programs. “For us, the playing at the Banknorth against the No.2 ranked team in the country, it’s a great opportunity for our guys.”Harvard faces one of the nation’s top teams after snapping a losing streak that had frustrated the Crimson for the past two months and seen the team go thirteen games without a win.Friday night’s 3-1 victory over the Union Dutchmen at the Bright Hockey Center allows the team to generate favorable momentum before it faces the Terriers—the most decorated team in Beanpot history, with 28 championship trophies. The win also allows freshman goalie Matt Hoyle to build confidence before tonight’s game, in which Hoyle will face an opponent who averages 3.7 goals per game.BU has put together a five-game winning streak, including a 3-1 victory over Merrimack on Friday night that saw the Terrier’s long-time coach, Jack Parker, earn his 800th career win.As the second-best team in the country, the Terriers bring all the usual attributes of a top-ranked squad to both ends of the ice.  The Terriers bring a stingy defense led by senior Matt Gilroy, a two-time All-American whose name has already been mentioned as a natural choice for first-team All-America honors again this year. BU’s defense has allowed just 47 goals in 25 games.Finding the back of the net will also require getting the puck past the Terriers’ freshman netminder, Kieran Millan—no easy task against a goalie who boasts a 1.47 goals-against-average and a 15-1-1 record in his first season.Also, thanks to leading scorers Chris Higgens, Jason Lawrence, and Brandon Yip—each of whom have recorded 11 goals so far this season—BU has managed to outscore opponents by nearly a two-to-one margin. Harvard players know how special it is to skate in the Beanpot, but they realize that the keys to victory in the Garden are same as those in the Bright, even if more of the Boston sports world is watching.“A lot of people make the Beanpot out to be something bigger than it is but it’s an unbelievable experience playing in the Beanpot,” junior Alex Biega said. “But we try to focus and do the same thing we do every day.  Just coming to practice focused.”For the Crimson players, discipline will be critical to prevent the Terriers from forcing Harvard to play their style of hockey.But between now and 5 p.m. this evening, the Crimson is eagerly awaiting the Beanpot as another chance to correct unfinished business from last year and provide a momentum boost when the team returns to ECAC play.“I think our guys are excited and last year, making it to the championship game,” Donato said. “I think our guys really got a taste of what potential opportunity the Beanpot could present.” —Staff writer Robert T.

In a gut-wrenching, back-and-forth game at Lavietes Pavilion Friday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team came out on the short end, as the University of Pennsylvania made the clutch plays down the stretch and got the bounces it needed to win 66-60.Tight throughout a second half that saw three ties and six lead changes, the Quakers (5-10, 1-0 Ivy) took the lead in the final two minutes and held on to it to give the Crimson (9-7, 1-2 Ivy) its second-straight home Ivy loss. Harvard got 14 points and six boards from junior forward Doug Miller and 13 points from junior guard Jeremy Lin, but the team was killed by abysmal free throw shooting, hitting just 7-of-16 attempts—including missing the front ends of four one-and-one chances. Friday’s loss came on the heels of a poor game from the foul line in an overtime loss last Saturday to Dartmouth in which the team made just 17-of-27 free throws—including the front ends of several one-and-ones near the end of regulation.“We just didn’t make foul shots,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “We’ve been one and two in our conference in free throw shooting as a team throughout the season and for whatever reason, things can become very contagious.”Sophomore forward Jack Eggleston had a game-high 19 points for the visitors and freshman guard Zach Rosen had 15 and nine assists for Penn as the Quakers took a huge game between teams hoping for the Ivy League crown.With the game knotted up 56-56, Rosen faked and drove to the hoop to draw a foul from Lin. Rosen hit both shots and his Harvard counterpart, Oliver McNally, had a tough jumper barely rim out, which Penn forward Cameron Lewis tied up for a jump-ball with the possession arrow in his team’s favor.After a time out, the Quakers ran a perfect play as soon as the ball was passed in, with Rosen finding a wide-open Eggleston for an easy dunk and a 60-56 lead with 1:07. Tough defense on the other end gave the Crimson no chance to score until Lin found Miller for a layup with 38.4 seconds to play.Rosen was fouled with 34 ticks left and knocked down both ends of his one-and-one. Shooting one-and-one again, the freshman missed the front end, but the ball bounced into the corner near the Penn bench and Eggleston beat Miller to it and called time. Quakers guard Tyler Bernardini caught the inbounds pass but was corralled and forced to use his team’s last timeout with 22 seconds left.“We group it all together in toughness—finishing free throws, getting loose balls, blocking out at the free throw line,” Miller said. “For us, it’s all the same. We feel like they were tougher than us today.”The game began with a wild and sloppy first half. Penn jumped out to a 12-6 lead five minutes in as it constantly beat the Crimson up the floor for baskets. Harvard answered that with a 12-0 run in which it forced four turnovers and watched Eggleston blow an easy two-hand dunk attempt. But the Quakers stayed strong and after Lin missed a layup with his team up 27-21 and under three minutes left, they closed out with a 10-0 run, despite another missed dunk, this time by Lewis.McNally and captain guard Andrew Pusar each missed the front-ends of one-and ones in that stretch as the team made just 1-of-6 attempts in the first half. It also turned the ball over 13 times, which would look worse if the visitors hadn’t gone one further, committing 14 turnovers in the first 20 minutes. In the second half, however, Penn turned it over only twice, compared to six for Harvard, helping the visitors overcome their 44.4 shooting percentage in the game.“We had a lot of energy in the first half and the turnovers forced were from the energy we brought,” Miller said. “Our energy went down a lot in the second half. That’s something the veterans have to keep going with the team so we can make sure we can win this Ivy League.” —Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Princeton rivalry has seen its fair share of drama over the past four years at Lavietes Pavilion. In 2006, the Tigers came back from a 59-53 deficit over the final 1:17 of play to win on a last second jumper, 60-59. Last year, the Crimson used a 20-8 run in the last seven minutes to force overtime and steal a victory.Suffice it to say, the Harvard faithful have seen their team’s greatest highs and lowest lows when Princeton comes to town.After a devastating 77-71 loss Saturday night, the Crimson (9-9, 1-3 Ivy) is as close as it’s ever been to being down and out.Expectations were high coming into the weekend, as Harvard was poised to vault itself into the upper echelons of the Ivy standings. After two crippling defeats, the team is left guessing what to do next.“It’s almost like we need to [re-]learn how to win,” senior guard Drew Housman said. “We’re always expecting a close game. We need to play hard for [the full] forty minutes and let the rest follow.”The story of the game was defense—or lack thereof. Coming into Saturday, Princeton had only mustered sixty points in five of its 14 matchups. In scoring 77, the squad easily eclipsed its season average.Yet the game was still undecided with seven minutes to play, as Harvard took its last lead at 56-54 with two free throws by freshman Keith Wright.From that point on, Harvard couldn’t buy a stop. With the exception of a ten-second violation forced by Housman and two missed free throws, Princeton scored on every trip down court to close out the contest. It posted a 23-15 run to finish the game.“They hit some tough shots, it wasn’t a lack of effort,” Housman said. “We need to improve on our communication. They confused us.”It was disappointing for the Crimson, which lost despite correcting its major flaws from the night before. Against Penn, Harvard struggled with turnovers, transition defense, and, of course, free throw shooting, going an abysmal 7-of-16 from the stripe and missing four front ends of one-and-ones.Saturday night was different. The Crimson cut down its turnovers, shot well from the line, going 20-for-27, and played efficiently on offense.But when it counted most, Harvard couldn’t get a hand in the Princeton guards’ faces on three point attempts, and the big men failed to body up on the Tiger’s inside giants.With just over two minutes to play, Harvard had cut the Princeton lead down to three, at 63-60. But on the ensuing possession, Princeton sophomore guard Dan Mavraides sunk a wide-open three after Harvard failed to switch on to him. Again, Harvard rebounded on a clutch three from Housman on the next possession, but needing a stop just a minute later, it happened again. With the Crimson down just 68-65, Mavraides nailed another wide-open trifecta after Princeton had broken down the Harvard trap with 30 seconds to play. A stop would have given the Crimson a shot, but Mavraides sealed Harvard’s fate, finishing the game with a team-high 22 points.“Every team goes through stretches where they struggled to win…unfortunately, we seem like we’re going through one of those moments,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “Hopefully we can crack that losing streak.”To break its current three-game slide, relying on junior Jeremy Lin may not be enough. Lin solidified his candidacy as a frontrunner for Ivy Player of the Year with another astounding 27 point, six rebound, four-assist performance, but the team still fell.To give Lin some help, Amaker may have found the solution in playing freshman point guard Oliver McNally with Housman more often in the rotation. The two had success playing together on Saturday, before McNally suffered a mild ankle sprain with five minutes to play and failed to return until the final minute.In his absence, Housman dominated, as he always does against the Tigers. Just two years ago, he posted one of the best performances in Crimson history, scoring 33 points, including 18 of the team’s final 20 to end regulation and in overtime, in a tough defeat in Princeton, N.J.Last night, it was more of the same, as Housman broke down the Tiger defense again and again for layups and threes to keep the team in the game.“I don’t think Princeton’s guards have ever been able to stay in front of Drew,” Lin said.But the 80-percent free throw shooter missed three big free throws in the final five minutes, which could have brought the home team closer. The shots all went in the bucket, and somehow bounced out, leaving the senior to scratch his head.“He was tremendous tonight, breaking the team down, making plays, making layups,” Amaker said. “I’m sure he’d be the first to tell you that he wishes he had made some of those free throws.”—Staff writer Walter E.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t pretty at times, but the Harvard men’s hockey team (5-11-4, 5-6-4 ECAC) got the job done on Friday night at the Bright Hockey center with a 3-1 win over visiting Union (12-12-1, 5-8-0 ECAC).  The win was the Crimson’s first in over two months and effectively ended a 13-game winless streak.“I told the guys after [the game] that it wasn’t exactly a pretty win and we didn’t do all the things that we wanted to do,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “But at this point, we’ll take it and hopefully we’ll use it as confidence and continue to improve. I think our guys are excited and quite honestly a little relieved to finally get in the win column.”Junior forward Doug Rogers got the scoring action going at 13:10 in the first, seconds after Harvard’s first power-play opportunity ended.  Assistant captain Alex Biega stole the puck from a Union defenseman before passing it to Rogers, waiting on the left post.  Though Rogers missed his first attempt at goal, clumsy goaltending by Dutchmen netminder Corey Milan allowed Rogers to bury it on the rebound. “[Biega] gave me a great pass right on my stick,” Rogers said.  “I’m not going to lie; I kinda fanned on the first one, but [the puck] luckily came back to me and I was able to slide it in.” Co-captain Jimmy Fraser almost doubled the lead minutes after the first goal when his shot from the blue line hit the crossbar.  The Crimson continued to dominate play during the first period, attempting a total of 20 shots as compared with Union’s 11 efforts.The second period, however, proved to be a different story.  While the first period was characterized by clean play and fast-moving hockey, penalties in the second period cluttered play and slowed the game’s speed, swinging the momentum in the Dutchmen’s favor.Union looked to even the score at 1:30 in the second when the Dutchmen unleashed a two-on-one attack on Harvard goaltender freshman Matt Hoyle, who deflected the wide-open attempt off his stick at the last moment.“I think sometimes penalties can have an effect on the game and I think the neutral zone was pretty well tied up,” Donato said. Amidst the Union onslaught, the Crimson managed to score on a power-play opportunity when sophomore forward Pier-Olivier Michaud tipped Biega’s shot on goal past Milan and into the net for a 2-0 lead. The Dutchmen quickly responded less than two minutes later with a power-play goal of their own.Union continued to look for the goal throughout the second and third, holding a 43-27 total shot advantage over Harvard during the two periods.  Despite its offensive blitz, the Dutchmen just couldn’t find the back of the net.“This is a good Union team,” Donato said.  “They’re well coached, they come at you and their first line is very good.”Harvard added an insurance goal with just 43 seconds remaining on the clock.  Union coach Nate Learman had pulled Milan with just under a minute left to give the Dutchmen an extra skater on the ice.  But the move ultimately failed, as senior forward Nick Coskren dove past a Dutchmen defender to give the puck a final push into the net. Coskren’s empty-netter made the final score 3-1 in favor of the Crimson, giving the team its first win since Nov. 15.  “We did the simple things well [Friday night],” Biega said.  “We established our forecheck, we got our lines going—that’s something we’ve done well, getting shots on the net.  We had to simplify our game and just do the simple things first.  I think as a team we’re starting to up our game and play the way we should be playing.”—Staff writer Lucy D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To earn its first victory in over two months, the Harvard men’s hockey team had to do it the hard way.
Rather than relying on pretty goals and offensive firepower, the Crimson worked from the defense up and kept a level head in a close, back-and-forth game.
Despite being outshot, 30-25, for the game, Harvard held on for the win behind the impressive performance of freshman goaltender Matt Hoyle.
After being benched in favor of junior backup John Riley in last Sunday’s game at Dartmouth, Hoyle made the most of his latest chance in net.
The rookie made 29 saves on the night, allowing just one goal on a well-executed power play from the Union offense.
“The one time they did beat [Hoyle], he really had no chance,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “The kid made a great shot, and he didn’t miss it by much.”
Goaltending as been a bit of a question mark for Harvard throughout the season, as the inexperienced tandem of Hoyle and Riley has tried to fill the skates of Kyle Richter, the top goalie in the ECAC last season.
Richter is taking a year-long leave of absence from the College.
Hoyle’s confidence and comfort level on the ice will be crucial to Harvard as it moves into an important stretch of league games that will decide home-ice advantage for the conference playoffs.
“He looked comfortable, and I thought we gave him a chance early to not be under the gun like he’s been in the last few games,” Donato said. “As he settled into the game, I thought he looked like it was going to take a very good scoring opportunity to get something by him.”
But Hoyle couldn’t have done it without some help from the Crimson defensive corps. 
“I thought overall our defense did a good job of eliminating the real quality scoring chances,” Donato said. “I thought [Union] generated some good shots, but I thought we did a pretty good job of not allowing second or third shots from tough areas.”
BOXED IN
Harvard players found themselves in the penalty box for all sorts of reasons on Friday night.
Late in the second period, just 20 seconds after the Crimson started a power play, junior defenseman Alex Biega was sprawled across the ice in front of a Dutchman skater. Although it appeared that Biega had simply tripped, the referees called an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for diving.
And on one of the more interesting plays of the night, sophomore Pier-Olivier Michaud was called for holding in the third period after wrapping both arms around a streaking Union player in an attempt to slow him down.
However, despite the wide range of penalties called, the Crimson’s penalty kill had a strong showing, limiting the Dutchmen to just one goal on six chances.
“I think it’s always the case when we kill off some penalties—we kind of take [the] momentum of the game,” Biega said. “Our special teams have been tremendous in the past two games and hopefully we can keep that going.”
SPARK PLUG
Harvard’s offensive breakout—the team has put up eight goals in its last two games—is long overdue. Prior to this week, the Crimson mustered just nine goals in its previous six contests. 
The team’s newfound offensive energy stems from the outstanding play of junior forward Doug Rogers, who has come alive over the past week.
Rogers had a hand in two of the Harvard goals on Friday, scoring the first and notching an assist on the second. 
That performance comes on the heels of Rogers’ four-point showing at Dartmouth last Sunday, where he tallied a hat trick and tacked on an assist in the 5-5 tie. Rogers is now second on the team with 13 points, trailing only Biega.
“I thought some of the key characters that we need…going forward stepped up for us and did a good job,” Donato said. “Whether you’re talking about Doug Rogers or Jimmy Fraser or Matt Hoyle, I thought we had a lot of guys who played well tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball program reached its 500th win with a hard fought 72-63 victory at Penn on Friday. The game, which was marked by back-and-forth play, saw three Crimson players post double figures.  Despite dominance from the charity stripe and precision outside shooting, the persistent Quakers (3-14, 0-3 Ivy) would not back down and stayed with Harvard (10-7, 2-1 Ivy) until the last minutes.“I’ll take it, coming out of exams because Penn is a better team than their record,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “You get a false sense from their record, but they are a very physical team.”Co-captain Emily Tay led the offensive attack with a 22-point performance. Sophomore Christine Matera wasn’t far behind, celebrating her 20th birthday with a career-high 17 points. Matera put the icing on the cake with a 5-for-5 effort from three-point land. Freshman Brogan Berry posted 19 points, while senior co-captain Niki Finelli led the Crimson with 7 rebounds.“I thought we played really well as a team,” Tay said. “We had different sparks from so many different players.”The game reached a climactic finish in the last five minutes, with crucial shots from Matera. With the score tied at 47, she hit a long range three pointer that was punctuated by a tip-in from sophomore Emma Markley, putting the Crimson up 52-47. Penn responded by scoring six of the next eight points to make it 54-53. Markley quashed the Quaker’s hopes of a game winning rally by tallying eight straight to extend Harvard’s lead to 62-53 with five minutes left in the game. “I thought we had really crucial plays that helped us break away in the end,” Tay said. “Markley sparked some momentum in the last minutes of the second half which we were able to finish with.” Tay hit two from the free-throw line to further the lead to 64-53. Penn responded by draining a pair of three pointers to pull within six, but perfection from the charity stripe carried Harvard to the win. In the final minute, the Crimson shot 6-for-6 from the free-throw line.In the first half, The Quakers opened up play with two consecutive shots to take a 4-0 lead. Harvard responded with a jumper from Tay to get on the board. The Quakers extended their lead with four straight points, bringing the score to 8-2. Tay tallied two more baskets and Berry hit a shot from behind the arc to put Harvard within one. The Crimson earned its first lead of the game off of a pair of Claire Wheeler free throws, making it 11-10. A layup from Berry and a three-pointer from Matera brought Harvard from 17-16 to a 22-16 advantage. “We just remained calm,” Delaney-Smith said. “Teams are always going to have runs; it’s how you react that dictates the outcome of the game.”Penn went on an 8-4 run over the next three minutes to pull within 26-24. The Crimson responded by finishing the half with a 6-0 run to take a 34-26 lead going into the second stanza. After the first half, both teams were evenly matched on the stat sheet, but the Crimson outshot the Quakers 50 to 20 percent from beyond the arc and 78-40 percent from the free throw line.“We weathered their scoring runs well,” Delaney-Smith said. “Christine hit some big shots, so did Brogran, Tay and Markley, while everyone stepped up on defense.”The Crimson carried its precision shooting into the second half and finished the game with a 46.9-percent rate from the field, 71.4 percent from beyond the arc, and 84 percent from the charity stripe. Penn shot 42.1 percent from the field and 37 percent from three point land.“A win like this definitely helps us get our game legs back,”Delaney-Smith said. “It’s always the case with the schedule we have.”—Staff writer Evan Kendall can be reached at kendall@fas.harvard.edu.
