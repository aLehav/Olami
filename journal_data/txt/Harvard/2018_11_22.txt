After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alien attacks, dystopian governments, and teenage girls with heroic dreams are not individually original subjects, but Brandon Sanderson manages to create a refreshing conglomeration of these elements in “Skyward,” the first installment in his ambitious new young adult series. As Sanderson’s novel is firmly planted in the sci-fi and fantasy genres, it has no shortage of fantastical world-building and engaging battle scenes. However, the book also grapples with competing definitions of cowardice and bravery in a surprisingly thorough fashion, considering the tendency of epic fiction, especially the kind meant for younger audiences, to simply paint courage as a positive attribute without fully exploring its nuances and implications. Despite its merits, “Skyward” has some significant flaws, namely repetitive plot structure consisting of battle after battle and its bland supporting cast of characters.
In the distant future of “Skyward,” Earth is merely a name in old lore. People have fled to the planet of Detritus, which is surrounded by a thick layer of orbiting debris. However, this new planet is in no way safe: People hide away in underground cities, in constant fear of an attack from the Krell, a mysterious, aggressive alien race whose only goal seems to be destroying human civilization. Pilots, trained to fly armed spacecrafts called “starfighters” and engage the Krell in aerial battle, are the people’s primary defense. Spensa Nightshade is the daughter of a pilot who is infamous for deserting his teammates in the midst of a crucial battle and being shot down for his cowardice, so she seeks to become a brilliant pilot herself to clear her family’s name and find out what happened during that fateful fight.
The strength of Sanderson’s work is his ability to create a palpable mood within each scene, especially those involving battle, whether it’s a sense of simultaneous wonderment and peril when “a sudden shower of hundreds of pieces of debris rained down, a blazing hail” or Spensa’s desperation as “my Poco [a starfighter model] rattled, nose trailing smoke, my console basically just a huge expanse of red lights.” However, the novel is so focused on inserting action into the plot that it becomes formulaic and almost predictable: Spensa enters a dangerous aerial battle, another supporting character inevitably is killed off, Spensa undergoes an emotional crisis, and the cycle repeats.
The dependence of the plot on action and battles limits the number of scenarios in which Spensa can interact directly with other characters and build meaningful interpersonal relationships. Although numerous characters are introduced and many deaths occur over the course of the novel, few of them are emotionally impactful or memorable because the depth of supporting cast members is rarely explored beyond what is necessary for them to either serve as a plot device to develop Spensa’s character, resolve a difficult conflict, or illustrate the devastation of war.
Since the novel focuses so deeply on Spensa’s journey, both mentally and physically, the crafting of the protagonist heavily impacts the story overall. For the first fourth of the book, Spensa’s dialogue mainly consists of melodramatic threats: “I will hold your tarnished and melted pin up as my trophy as your smoldering ship marks your pyre, and the final resting place of your crushed and broken corpse!” She seems comically cartoonish at best and is only portrayed as powerful and brave when acting masculine, an un-feminist representation of who is supposed to be a strong, female lead.
However, Spensa is soon forced to reconsider what truly constitutes bravery and cowardice by the commentary of other characters on her behavior: “You seem like you really want to defy the admiral… Maybe you should consider not allowing them to define victory or failure for you.” Such dialogue makes it clear that Spensa is not meant to be taken as a true ideal of heroism, but an example of the consequences of society’s worship of foolish, unnecessary violence as proof of courage. Sanderson cleverly uses Spensa’s character to satirize heroic protagonists in general, turning the “special snowflake” and teen rebel tropes on their heads: Heroes are often only deemed heroic because they abide by their society’s definition of success and in that sense, they are not unique at all, but sharing the common dream of acceptance by their peers.
“Skyward” doesn’t have a strictly upward trajectory — it has brilliantly fleshed-out action scenes balanced with relatively shallow supporting characters. It has a rather unlikeable protagonist, yet makes commentary on the broader theme of what it means to be a hero using that same protagonist. Still, despite its flaws, “Skyward” is worth reading — it’s more than merely a promise of cheap thrills and space battles, hooking its audience first with its immersive atmosphere and later with its thought-provoking questions about the very nature of heroism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When painter Susan E. Miller-Havens opened the first ever artist-operated gallery in Harvard Square earlier this fall, the development and rising rents of the Square had long been on her mind. Miller-Havens, who has two works displayed in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, has lived in Cambridge since 1968. Two years ago, she came face to face with a redevelopment project that made her plans for the near future inextricable from the state of the Square. Strolling among dozens of her paintings arranged salon-style at 9 JFK Street, Miller-Havens spoke to The Harvard Crimson about her gallery’s role in the Square and the challenges of her profession.
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve said the title of this exhibit, “Now You See It Now You Don’t,” refers to businesses closing in Harvard Square. Why is it important to send this message?
Susan E. Miller-Havens: Harvard Square is a wonderful, wonderful place full of eclectic, family-run businesses. Regency Centers purchased this block, including Curious George, Tess, and Urban Outfitters about two and a half years ago for 84 million dollars. Every day we come to work, there’s another business that’s gone because of the rent.
THC: How have you and the Harvard Square community responded to the development?
SEMH: I belong to the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association and Harvard Square Business Association, and we have been at Regency about their empty storefronts and the fact that there’s no art in the Square because it’s not affordable. It’s not something any artist would think they would ever do, unless they were extraordinarily wealthy. Regency has listened to the community and did scale back a lot of what they were going to do. It is still an enormous project which is supposed to begin in February.
THC: Why did you open this gallery at 9 JFK Street?
SEMH: My present studio is at 18 Brattle Street, where I’ve been for seven or eight years. I felt I needed to start packing up and figuring out where I’m going in February. I had a problem with putting my inventory in storage for however long it takes them to finish this, and we don’t even know if we can afford to come back. The property manager suggested I look at this storefront. I said that was very nice, but I couldn’t afford it, and she said I could pay the rent that I’m paying and be here for four months.
You could sit here all day long and watch the people walk by. It’s just fascinating. A lot of people that come in are surprised because they think the sneaker store is here and because there aren’t any art galleries in the Square. They’ve never had anything like it.
THC: What plans do you have for your time here?
SEMH: This was a sneaker store, and it’s absolutely perfect for a gallery. The lighting is perfect. All we had to do was paint the walls. I’d really like this gallery to be a place where people enjoy coming in. I’m planning to have some events here, some music. I wish Regency would understand that to have a space like that in Harvard Square would really be important, but it’s not their priority. For the next four months, we’ll just make use of it and, hopefully, be able to sell some of my inventory so that I’m not in dire straits in February.
THC: What is your favorite memory of Harvard Square?
SEMH: What I remember most of all is walking down the Palmer Street alley and down the stairs to Club 47 to hear Paul Butterfield. I could not believe we were going do that in this very small place, sitting right up front. In those days, you didn’t have to go to the Orpheum Theatre or Boston Garden or some huge venue to hear a musician.
THC: Another Cambridge location that houses your art is Cambridge City Hall. How was your experience painting former Mayor Alice K. Wolf for that space?
SEMH: The mayor didn’t want to have her portrait painted at all to begin with. Part of the problem was that some of the paintings done of former mayors that hang down in City Hall. [sic] There are some really beautiful paintings down there, but some are just very uninspiring. It’s all men in there, and almost everybody has a red tie on. I think she thought I would be able to do something different, and she wanted a local woman to paint her portrait.
She loved to wear scarves, so I had her bring a whole box of scarves so I could find something that didn’t look like the wallpaper. We had a wonderful time. In Alice’s portrait she is gesturing, which is what she did constantly. When I told her that, she didn’t quite believe it until I showed her the photographs.
THC: You received your Doctorate in Human Development from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. How did your psychology background inform your pieces here?
SEMH: When you try to get to know someone — I was a therapist in the past — it’s often helpful to not stare at them and to give them space. In the “Women’s Best Friends” I wanted to capture that if that if you know the person, you will know her by simply the way that she’s sitting, and, by her relation to the dog, the loyalty the dog has to her. The other psychological part is the absence of background. I want you to be drawn into the person and not into the space behind.
THC: What is the most difficult part of the painting process?
SEMH: People say, “Painting, it must be so much fun!” Well, actually, it’s not fun at all. It’s only fun if it works. When the painting doesn’t speak to you at all, when it doesn’t move you at all, there’s something wrong with it. It has to sing somehow. And it’s also physically hard work.
THC: What are you working on next?
SEMH: At this point in my life, I don’t have the energy to paint big pieces anymore. I’m looking for some more inspiration, and I got a little inkling of it a couple of weeks ago. When you’re putting on something like this and have to be an administrator, it doesn’t lend itself to painting. I have to go back to my studio and close the door and make myself do something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Common Threads: Weaving Stories Across Time,” which runs through Jan. 13 at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, features a diverse collection of textile-inspired artworks of different mediums, created by contemporary artists from around the world. The exhibit strives to “explore the ways in which the art of the past continues to inspire artists now” and executes this goal perfectly. Each piece is distinctive from the others, and ties together both old and new elements of textile art in a novel way.
The exhibit is split into two components: the Cyrus Tapestries, a set of five 16th century tapestries depicting the rise and fall of Cyrus the Great, and the collection of various contemporary pieces in the Hostetter Gallery on the second floor. Though the museum has been in possession of the Cyrus Tapestries for awhile, composer David Lang’s new opera “true pearl: an opera in five tapestries” puts a contemporary twist on the exhibit. The minimalist-style opera features five tracks corresponding to the five main tapestries in the collection, which visitors listen to through provided headsets as they view each tapestry at their own pace. Strange, repetitive lyrics sung by a chorus of voices describe the scene depicted on the corresponding tapestry. For the tapestry in which a secret messenger from Harpagos, the king’s general, delivers a note concealed inside the body of a dead rabbit to Cyrus, the voices sing “We’ll never forget this rabbit. Hare of the steppes / The papers in its gut, concealed.” The opera offers an unusual but refreshingly inventive complement to the exhibit, allowing the visitor to experience art across time periods and mediums through visual and auditory stimulation. The ambient and experimental feel of the music enable the visitor to view the historical tapestries from a new perspective, effectively fitting the theme of connecting “stories across time.”
The other part of the exhibit features a variety of works which integrate different materials, methods, and mediums. Pieces in this collection are created by artists from around the world. “The Great Bare Mat” by the Raqs Media Collective is a carpet inspired by a pun, which comes from two Chinese Han Dynasty bronze mat-weights shaped like bears. One remarkable feature of this carpet, tying together the past and the present, is the seemingly random pattern of white lines spanning across the carpet — the pattern was actually generated by a computer algorithm belonging to members of the Raqs Media Collective. Examples of other works in the exhibit include Lee Mingwei’s “The Mending Project,”  a dynamic and interactive piece which invites visitors to bring a broken item to be repaired by a volunteer, intended to spark conversation and “small moments of connection and repair,” according to a description at the exhibit, and Nevet Yitzhak’s “Warcraft,” a digital animated projection of Afghan prayer rugs depicting the mechanical destruction of war, complete with explosive sound effects. Although every work in the room is unique and vastly distinct from any other piece, they are all connected by the same theme of integrating the old and the new to tell powerful stories of the human experience across time.
Even for non-contemporary art enthusiasts, this exhibit is a must-see. Though the exhibit itself is not large, it leaves a powerful impression on the viewer that will last well beyond the walls of the museum. “Common Threads: Weaving Stories Across Time” truly lives up to its name, beautifully demonstrating how art can break barriers and connect people across time and across cultures.

In “WET: A DACAmented Journey,” directed by Kevin Comartin and produced by Liz Ross, Anner Cividanis (Alex Alpharoah) is “an American in every sense of the word” — except on paper. The play’s title alludes to his journey from home in Los Angeles to Guatemala to see a terminally ill grandfather of whom he has no memory, but also to have an underlying emotional and psychological journey. As Cividanis explains, being undocumented means planning life in two-year increments: always being in a period of transition and never quite attaining a sense of assuredness or stability. An amalgam of performance elements like spoken word poetry, acting, narration, and rapping culminates in an arresting anecdote that also functions as a documentary.
The play has an uncontrived setting and conversational tone, one in which theater was not trying to reproduce a series of events, but to retell it. It lends itself to being evaluated in terms of its storytelling, rather than in terms of the many elements that typically construe theater. In the Emerson Paramount Center Jackie Liebergott Black Box Theater, the play’s sparse set includes a bench with a rod to hang a hat and jacket and three stools, in front of a backdrop of outlined silhouettes standing before abstract skylines of Guatemala and Los Angeles. At most, Cividanis moves from one stool to another, making no more motion than hand gestures or quick strides, his eye contact and positioning putting him in conversation with the audience. On stage, he bashes a review of the very same play that misidentified him as a “black man” (he is Central American), expressing rage at the phenomenon of the “caravan that is a national emergency,” and saying “bless you” when an audience member sneezes. Interwoven in Anner’s story are the recent dates of passed immigration legislation and trips he has made. Like politics and the state of immigration from hour to hour under the Trump administration, the play evolves and aims to root itself in the present.
Alpharoah begins with spoken word, wearing the baseball cap that would come to signify, throughout the play, his performance of poetry. He discusses a heritage of which he is proud, citing the Mayan pyramids of Guatemala before continuing the story, imploring the audience to see him in the fullness of his humanity. He pulses his arms, looks to the heavens, and chants rhythmically as though to signify the heavy beating of his heart in moments of distress. He unexpectedly morphs from his own monologue into the dialogue of the school children who mocked him for not having immigration papers growing up, calling him a “dirty mojado.” Although Alpharoah cannot effectively play the part of a child, his presence as the only actor on stage — which by no means comes at the expense of the play — contributes to the anecdotal aspect, and it is clear when he slides left on the bench and changes the pitch of his voice that he’s playing another character.
Alpharoah’s writing and acting additionally brings authenticity to the work, whether in the form of the endearing “mijo” he adds as he plays his grandfather, the imitated accents of people he encounters in prison, or the anxious trembling of his hands while passing through Customs and Border Control as he re-enters the country using advanced parole. He elicits attention not only through the typical showiness of theater, but through a voice and a story that comes from any effective orator. The only moment that seems out of place is when he mimics a disabled elderly man from the nursing home — this is somewhat problematic, a scene in which “telling” rather than “showing” would have sufficed.
The show includes few theatrical elements. The lights and sound hinted at the play’s greater, but missed, potential. Sound bites of Obama’s speech announcing DACA comes on over the speaker while an expectant, enthusiastic Anner listens, and later coverage of Trump’s Muslim ban follows, hitting Anner with vertigo. There were moments when bright white lights shone, representing a lighter spirit as Anner emerges from a stressful ordeal or receives DACA. Pink lights flash to emphasize Alpharoah’s transition to depicting his daughter Aileen, and flashing red and blue lights signify the headlights of a police car. These elements were so effective that they underlined the lack of similar elements that, done right, could have enhanced the play.
At the end of the play, Alpharoah cited statistics to reinforce the performance’s relevance with an emotional appeal that was already convincing: The prison-industrial complex makes billions annually, and among over 14 million undocumented migrants, only 800,000 have been granted DACA. Once again, a spoken word poet wearing a cap and artful white bomber jacket, makes a sociopolitical appeal — “What I am not, is your enemy.” “WET: A DACAmented Journey” portrays a common immigrant experience from which many Americans are too far removed to develop a well-informed opinion, showing that sometimes, the facts need to be paired with story. When Alpharoah becomes his daughter, crying about not knowing whether her father will travel safely to Guatemala and back, or Anner’s mother screaming “Ayúdame!” when her starving baby has a seizure as she tries to cross the border to America, his inspired acting makes an emotional argument beyond the scope of any political debate.

Ian A. Askew ’19 is a senior in Quincy House seeking a joint concentration in Theater, Dance, & Media and History & Literature. In 2017, he founded and directed the first edition of the Harvard Black Playwrights Festival. On Nov. 10, he premiered his thesis, “: A Story Project.” He has also worked on “The Black Clown” at the American Repertory Theater and “Clairvoyance,” a yearlong residency at the ART by Diana Oh. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Askew to chat about his thesis, his artistic work, and work at the ART.
The Harvard Crimson: What made you interested in the arts growing up and how did that influence your decision to come to Harvard?
Ian A. Askew: I wasn’t raised in a family of artists. They’re absolutely creative people, but I wasn’t playing instruments or anything. I grew up in Takoma Park in Maryland, which has a pretty nice community arts scene, so I was encouraged pretty early on to pick up percussion by friends and family. So I was playing drums and playing in bands my whole childhood, and I still do. I started doing theater in high school and always found it to be a useful way of getting my energy out and expressing myself.
THC: Could you talk about your previous artistic work on campus?
IAA: Before this year, when I came to Harvard initially, most of my artistic happening was with the Renegade collective, which was a group founded by Jennifer A. Gathright ’16 and Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16 the year before I came to Harvard. Through that, I got an introduction to art as a kind of advocacy on campus. I was asked to help write the show called “Black Magic,” which is very much in the vein of Renegade. I really didn’t expect to be doing music and theater on campus as much as I did when I got to college. I kept doing things with BlackC.A.S.T. I did a show called “love conjure/blues,” I sound designed a show called “Bootycandy,” and by that time I realized I wanted to be studying performance, so I added TDM to my concentration at the end of my sophomore year.
THC: Your thesis, “: A Story Project,” went up this weekend. What was that process like?
IAA: Instead of focusing on a final project, I was interested in focusing on the actual process. So what that ended up looking like in the final iteration, which was really influenced by some advice from professors, was essentially getting a group of people together once — and then twice — a week to share stories with each other and try and generate something. The first few sessions we just kind of did writing exercises and shared stories with each other. The next sessions we tried movement. We tried devising some dance, and then we started talking about what kind of performance we want to put up with these ideas we’ve generated. And that then rolled into formulating what was “: A Story Project,” the performance, which was a series of parties and get-togethers in which people entered a room, were offered food or invited to bring food and share it with each other, and for the most part were asked to share stories, some based on prompts, but mostly based on each other’s reactions.
THC: It sounds somewhat similar to what Diana Oh was trying to do with her “Clairvoyance” residency. What has that been like?
IAA: Working with Diana has been really incredible. I think her ethic of audience experiences was really influential to this project. A small detail, but something that’s emblematic of Diana’s relationship with her audiences, was that for the culminating performance for “{my lingerie play},” the bathroom was behind the stage, and she had marked out a path on the stage for the audience to go to the bathroom whenever they needed. Just the idea of prioritizing audience’s comfort and being able to be a whole person in this space was super influential for what “: A Story Project” ended up being.
THC: I’d also love to talk about the Harvard Black Playwrights Festival, which you founded and directed last year. What was the inspiration behind that project?
IAA: That was founded and directed by myself as well as Madison E. Johnson ’18, who graduated last year. The two of us were in Sam Marks’ playwriting class. Sam Marks ended up being an enormous asset and the faculty advisor to the festival. I think both of us had a similar ethic coming into my thesis, and this Black Playwrights Festival was kind of related to “love conjure/blues” and related to my thesis in that it’s a reaction to how student theater was happening, is happening, and the ways in which that didn’t feel right for myself and Madison. I think we saw that there was so much creative energy and so much creative content coming out of black theater-makers on campus, but because students felt a responsibility to take everything to the final stage — meaning from writing the script to putting it up on stage with lights and choreography and everything — and oftentimes it can feel like that’s making things more difficult than they need to be, and you cut off the amount of creative energy. We figured that the format of the reading allows you to bring something to life in a way that’s not intensive, but that is collective and generative and helps you improve something and build a sense of community.
THC: Were there any challenges to running the festival in that format, or in the formation of the festival itself?
IAA: Off the top of my head, I think that the main challenge was expectations. It was trying to wrap our minds around — and trying to encourage other people working on it to wrap their minds around — the idea that the intention of something to be unfinished was only to be very simple and expressive, and that you didn’t need to try and control every piece of the reading because it was a demonstration. It was a bringing-to-life, and it’s not intended to be the polished presentational product that more intensive or elaborative theater focuses on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard (22-8, 10-2 NWPC) capped off yet another successful season with a deep run in conference tournament play. Ultimately, the run concluded with a defeat to Princeton 12-10 in the NWPC championship game.
The Crimson met the Tigers (19-10) for the second straight year in the NWPC championship game. Last season, Harvard came out on top 12-11 to clinch its berth in the Ivy League tournament. The Crimson squad then found relative success in NCAAs, getting past George Washington University in the first round before suffering a disappointing loss against top-ranked University of Southern California.
This year however, Harvard faced a different fate. The conference championship bout began as a tightly-contested match, as the Crimson and the Tigers were separated by a single goal at the end of the first half.
The second half saw Princeton emerge as a dominant force in the game. Scoring spurts by the Tigers dug a deep hole for Harvard to recover from.
The Crimson had every reason to give up, yet it didn’t. Harvard answered every one of Princeton’s runs with one of its own. However, Princeton’s second-half dominance was unmatched, as it avenged their second-place finish from last year with a conference title.
The resilience shown by the Crimson in its final game of the season, although not enough to top a scorching-hot Princeton squad, was a metaphor for the team’s entire season.
“It was the story of the year: we fell behind early and kept battling,” junior captain Austin Sechrest said. “Unfortunately that one game we came up short but I think throughout the season no matter what happened we were going to keep battling for each other.”
That rollercoaster story began with a devastating loss to No. 5 Pacific University, a game which Harvard suffered a 20-10 defeat after beating Austin College in the same day.
The loss to Pacific set the Crimson back to a record of 2-4 and a demanding schedule ahead with the likes of No. 18 George Washington, No. 8 UC Davis, and No. 3 UC Berkeley in Harvard’s way.
However, the sense of resilience that kept the Crimson within reach at the end of the conference championship game also kept its nationally-ranked status alive. The squad went on to win nine out of their next 10 games, topping the third ranked team in the country, UC Berkeley, in the process.
The shocking upset over Cal brought Harvard into the discussion of the best teams in the nation. After a sub-par beginning to the season, the Crimson was able to assert themselves as a dominant force capable of competing with the nation’s best. Yet this massive feat — although giving Harvard the confidence to face off against any opponent — paradoxically became a limiting factor in its growth as a unit.
“After we beat Cal it was tough to refocus because it was the very beginning of the season and we still had so much to accomplish,” junior captain Bennie Seybold said. “After that win we kind of went a little stagnant: we had this period where we had to search within ourselves and say ‘Are we going to let this one game define our season or are we going to bounce back and make a statement as conference champions?’”
Following its 9-1 run, the Crimson posted a much less-impressive .500 effort over the next eight games. Harvard, who was then ranked seventh in the nation, suffered losses to No. 18 Brown, No. 15 Bucknell, Santa Clara University, and No. 19 San Jose State during the eight game stretch.
Yet again, however, the Crimson’s resilience kept its season alive. The squad ended the regular season on a commanding six game win streak, tied for its longest of the season.
The rollercoaster ride endured by the squad ended on a high note, bringing Harvard into the NWPC tournament as a dominant force.
Suffering a loss to Brown earlier in the season, the Crimson looked to avenge its regular season defeat in the semifinals of the tournament, which was hosted in Providence.
The contest was yet another test of Harvard’s will, as the team itself in a two-goal deficit at the end of the first half. However, the team kept battling and held Brown scoreless in the third quarter of the game, ultimately setting up sophomore attacker Dennis Blyashov to cut the lead and help the Crimson edge the Bears 11-10.
Although the final against Princeton did not end in Harvard’s favor, the Crimson left the tournament with an extremely successful record, battling through a demanding schedule. Blyashov and Sechrest earned first-team All-Tournament honors while Freshman goalie Noah Hodge earned second-team All-Tournament recognition.
“One thing that our team lives by is ‘you learn more from a loss than you do a win’ and I think that it would've been great to win that conference championship, but we all learned a ton from losing that game,” Seybold said. “So hopefully we can take that and translate that energy into next season.”
The test against Princeton gave the squad a lesson to remember for the next season, where thirteen people are expected to return for another deep run into the postseason.

Seeking a win after two weekends off, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (2-3-1) delivered a 7-3 blowout over Holy Cross (0-13-2) in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center Tuesday night.  The Crimson finished the night with strong performances across the board, with nine players scoring an assist or goal on the night and the top line clocking in 10 points total.
After an evenly matched opening to the game, Harvard took its lead quickly late in the first period, scoring twice, first off a goal from senior Bradley Fusco at 15:09, assisted by freshman Kate Glover and junior Kate Hallett and then from a shot from junior Kate Hughes with assists from senior Lexie Laing and freshman Kristi Della Rovere 1:30 later at 16:39.  The pair of goals marked Hughes and Della Rovere’s first goals of the season.
“On the goal that I scored, we had possession in the offensive zone for [about] twenty seconds,” Hughes said. “We were just moving it around between [Della Rovere, Laing, and me] and Kristen [Della Rovere] made a really good pass to Lexie Laing, who shot it, hit the goalie, and I was just there for the rebound, coming in with speed.”
That critical chemistry, especially on the first line, carried the Crimson to four more goals in the first seven minutes of the second period, one apiece for freshmen Kaitlin Tse, freshman Keely Moy, sophomore Becca Gilmore, and Della Rovere.
“We’d especially been working on scoring in practice and getting pucks to the net, and tonight was a really good example of all the hard work we’ve put in,” Hughes noted. “Being back in a game setting, everyone was really excited, and things were just working our way.”
Holy Cross clawed back with two more goals, one halfway through the second period and the next early in the third period, but its efforts weren’t enough to give the Crimson a legitimate challenge.  A Lexie Laing goal at 10:32 in the third period all but put away the game for the Crimson, with Holy Cross finding the back of the net once more late in the game.
“Overall, as a team, we used our systems and stuck to the game plan really well,” Della Rovere said. “We battled really hard from start to finish, and everyone gave it a hundred and ten percent.  It just came down to passion, everyone wanted this win so bad, and we have a rivalry with Holy Cross.”
The final box score told the story of the night for the Crimson.  Six players (Della Rovere, Laing, Hughes, Tse, Moy, and Gilmore) finished with two or more points on the night and three more recorded a point (Glover, Hallett, and Fusco).  Harvard converted on one of its four power play opportunities, finished with 39 shots on goal, 18 more than Holy Cross, and won faceoffs by a 34-15 margin.
Up next for Harvard is a pair of matchups over Thanksgiving weekend against No. 1 Wisconsin, but the team noted that the dominant victory over Holy Cross helped the team gather its poise for this upcoming challenge.
“Wisconsin is a top team and tonight we were able to gain our confidence back,” Della Rovere said. “We have to go into Wisconsin knowing that we’re not an underdog, that we’ve got that confidence and we’ll make them respond to us.”

On Saturday, the storied clash between the Harvard men’s hockey team and archrival No. 15 Cornell will add a new chapter to its book — and a new stage. In its first date with the Big Red (5-3-0, 3-1-0 ECAC) and fourth matchup against a ranked team this season, the Crimson (2-3-2, 1-2-2) will skate at Madison Square Garden, the National Hockey League’s oldest arena.
MSG is far from a foreign setting for Harvard’s coaching staff, as the team has played there thrice since the appointment of current head coach Ted Donato ’91 in 2004; neither is it a new venue for Cornell. But this weekend will be the first time the Garden plays host to this particular college hockey rivalry.
“What do they refer to MSG as, the ‘world’s most famous arena’?” said coach Donato with a smile. “In the broadest sense, college is about having great experiences, and exposing yourself to different challenges, and opening your mind to different things. For our guys to have an opportunity to play at Madison Square Garden in [front of] what would most likely be an excellent crowd, I think, is a great life experience.”
Experience aside, the Crimson has a significant challenge ahead in its opponent, and will no doubt be looking for revenge. Last season, the Big Red won both contests between the teams, including a thriller in Ithaca, N.Y., that was decided by a Cornell goal 2.6 seconds before the buzzer. This season’s schedule will allow Harvard three chances at payback, as Saturday’s MSG game is a neutral, non-conference one. And whatever its outcome, both squads get a second go the very next week, when the Big Red visits Bright-Landry.
“We don’t really get to do that that often, where you’re playing a team one weekend and then you see them the next,” said co-captain and forward Michael Floodstrand. “It’ll be nice to get them Saturday night and then have a chance to look at the video, then kind of be acclimated where there’s ECAC and Ivy League points on the board.”
Cornell currently sits at third in the ECAC, having just bested No. 18 Princeton, 5-1, in a clash of the conference titans. While the players that put the daggers in last year’s series sweep have graduated, the Big Red still returns several skaters who have made their mark against the Crimson, like junior defenseman Yanni Kaldis and senior forward Mitch Vanderlaan.
Leading scoring for Cornell is Kaldis (4–5—9) himself; pacing the team in goals is sophomore forward Morgan Barron (5–2—7). The biggest threat is in net: sophomore goaltender Matt Galajda, who shut out Harvard in its rink and was the country’s best net-minder last year (21-5-2, 1.51 GAA, .939 SV%).
“They obviously have a really good goalie, and team defense in general is pretty strong,” sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh said. “I think they play us very hard, as most teams do, but just especially ’cause it’s Harvard-Cornell…. But obviously they’re beatable. I think we’re pretty fired up because of what happened last year, not beating them at all.”
A source of optimism for the Crimson heading into Saturday could be that Galajda’s formidable numbers have fallen (2.52 GAA, .885 SV%). The Big Red’s team goals-against per game has risen (2.62) since last season’s NCAA-best 1.58. In contrast Harvard’s goals-for per game is on the up, and at 3.86 is good for fifth in the nation. Still, the Crimson will need to bring all its speed and scoring skill if it hopes to crack Cornell’s solid defense.
Key to that speed and skill are junior defenseman Adam Fox (3–12—15), who leads the team in scoring and whose 2.14 points per game pace the NCAA, and co-captain and forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage, whose five goals pace the team. His recent four-point weekend earned Zerter-Gossage ECAC Player of the Week accolades; carrying that hot streak forward could prove a short- and long-term reward for Harvard. The Crimson also has a potent offensive weapon in the most efficient power play unit in the country (36.4%). But the team hasn’t had the best record when it comes to striking first this season.
“We just have to play our game for a full 60,” Walsh said. “If we play a full 60 I think not a lot of teams in this league can play with us when we’re consistent…. It’s going to be a huge first period on Saturday, to get the first goal and get the lead, and I think with [the Big Red], once they get a lead they rarely give it up.”
Despite its success in team scoring thus far, Harvard is also a bottom-10 squad in terms of goals against. Senior net-minder Michael Lackey has now started five straight games; while his season numbers are less than ideal for the squad (2-2-2, 3.23 GAA, .880 SV%), that stretch did contain strong performances, including a 4-1 win against No. 18 Arizona State (1.01 GAA, .968 SV%). Saturday also won’t be Lackey’s first time lacing ’em up at MSG, as he and some other members of the senior class played in 2016’s Rivalry on Ice clash against Quinnipiac, skating to a 5-4 overtime loss.
In tightening up team defense the Crimson will also look to prepare for the high intensity of a Cornell clash and the big stage of an NHL arena. On Wednesday, the team practiced at Warrior Ice Arena, the practice facility of the Boston Bruins, and will continue its regular practice schedule over Thanksgiving break. After an afternoon off for time with family — for out-of-town students, a meal at a local teammate’s house — the players will get ready to head to New York City on Friday morning.
The bottom line for Harvard, though, is maintaining an upward trajectory heading into December. Floodstrand believes the team is on its way there already.
“We might have had a rough start numbers-wise, but it’s a long season,” Floodstrand said. “We’re going to be one of those teams, I think, [that] in December, January, February really takes stride and gets hot going into playoffs. I’m happy with the progress we’ve made; we’ve definitely had a few tough games that we wish we could take back but that stuff’s behind you.”
For coach Donato, who spent a season with the New York Rangers towards the end of his professional career, visiting Madison Square Garden is also a bit of a homecoming. In his three trips there as a coach, though, the Crimson has come away with three losses. The Big Red, on the other hand, have been undefeated in its five contests at MSG since 2013. Starting at 8 p.m. on Saturday, Harvard will aim to break both those streaks at once.
