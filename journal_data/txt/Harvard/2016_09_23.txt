After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A genius of geniuses, a computer hacker, and a defiant government rebel. An unexpected romantic, an epileptic, and a moral human being. The former list is perhaps the perception of Edward Snowden as viewers have seen in media until now; Oliver Stone’s “Snowden” presents the latter image and attempts to bridge the gap between the two seemingly exclusive personas. Based on the books “The Snowden Files” by Luke Harding and “Time of the Octopus” by Anatoly Kucherena, “Snowden” touches the fine line between propaganda and biography in a series of politically-charged thriller scenes that switch from his pre-leak personal life to the final moments before the release of his article in “The Guardian.”
However, “Snowden” is not explicit propaganda for its eponymous protagonist’s heroism or traitorship. A master of balancing cinematic discretion and controversy (as shown in his films “JFK” and “Platoon”), Oliver Stone takes many strides to provide the truth behind government surveillance and in doing so, also fills in the blanks of Snowden’s personal life so as to garner support for his ethical dilemma and subsequent decisions. The less-than-optimal portrayals of key government figures, Snowden's unwavering commitment to a morality based on constitutionality, and the interwoven romance and heartache are factual, but whether the inclusion of such information serves as relevant context or media-catered distraction from the central issue is less clear. Despite some information that arguably can be classified more as fluff than as substance, “Snowden” succeeds in telling a compelling story that risks being repetitive.
As this generation’s most famous (and perhaps the country’s most revered) whistleblower, Edward Snowden has become a household name—and Mr. Stone is well aware of our familiarity. Even before seeing the movie, we know the ending: the leak, the exodus, the controversy. This knowledge taints a substantial portion of the movie with dramatic irony. Following Snowden’s injury at Fort Benning in 2004 that precludes his active duty in the Special Forces, the doctor’s comforting words that “there are plenty of other ways to serve your country” seem like a set-up for the next decade of unwanted discoveries and moral quandaries. Snowden’s initial loyalty to his country—complete with CIA inspection and many utterances confirming that USA is indeed the best nation in the world—and simultaneous donning of a “I Support Online Rights” sticker on his laptop intentionally set a tone of tension and the context for future debate.
In efforts to appease his moral sensibilities after witnessing a CIA employee force a drunk Swiss banker to drive, Snowden resigns from his first position at the CIA in Geneva. Soon after, he leaves both the opulence of his life and his girlfriend for a hotel in Hong Kong—his refuge and embarking point for leaking classified information. And amid the tension and suspense, romance is Stone’s chosen mechanism for humanizing Snowden’s story. These interwoven scenes are not a novel technique, but they serve as a refreshing telling of Snowden’s story that keeps interest and a steady source of drama.
Playing the titular character, Joseph Gordon-Levitt adopts a deeper, slower voice and composed disposition that actually mimic Snowden’s own mannerisms (at least from what audiences have seen from limited interviews) quite well—he wears no trace of his usual quirky and hopelessly romantic persona. Still, Stone made a strategic move in capitalizing on Gordon-Levitt’s ability to deliver a convincing romance, but so much so that it arguably distracts from the core story. Shailene Woodley, removed from her usual teen romance or dystopian hero role, comes to screen as Snowden’s famed partner, Lindsay Mills, an eccentric, liberal artist who playfully challenges his staunch loyalty to his country. What their relationship does bring to the movie, however, is a refreshing sense of trust that is almost absent in the world of clandestine technological spying. Their differences in ideology lighten the film’s otherwise heavy political climate—their first kiss, according to Snowden, “tastes like a liberal.” The duo’s tear-jerking love story of separation and blind trust weaves in an empathetic connection to Snowden’s case, so by the time he releases the information to “The Guardian,” viewers see the life he has left behind to serve his part in justice and honesty.
At the film’s conclusion, Edward Snowden emerges content and without remorse from the Hawaiian headquarters of the CIA into a sea of blindingly bright light and clips of international rallies on Snowden’s behalf, with President Obama struggling to articulate an adequate response. These elements combined nudge the movie into the propaganda realm, but organically so—Stone’s purpose is to reveal the truth, and aside from some attention-grabbing diversions, “Snowden” does just that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the confetti—and balloons—settled on the stages of the Democratic and Republican charades, our majestic democracy presented us with two leaders—both of whom have raised flags of belligerence. Hillary Clinton’s history in Congress and in the Obama administration might as well be prefaced with “H is for Hawk,” while Trump has made open promises to authorize “something beyond waterboarding.” 
People on both side of our wisely-carved political spectrum are wary of the foreign policy consequences of either a Clinton or Trump presidency. It seems that things would be a heck of a lot more reassuring if the presidency held no consequential power at all. A titular presidency, that would compare in powerlessness and extravagance with the British monarch, would possibly quench Clinton’s thirst of the iron throne, and it would most certainly bestow enough publicity on Trump to compensate for his other insecurities. The hawks would be hearty and the wars could be prevented.
Such a powerless presidency is a far cry from where we stand now, but a discussion on reining the executive power of the American president does merit some attention.
The American presidency has been gradually becoming more unilateral in waging wars. The second World War, the Cold War and the more recent War on Terrorism have greatly empowered the American president to commit the nation to war-path without any authorization from Congress.
President Harry Truman’s didn’t think that he needed the authorization of Congress to commit American troops to war in Korea. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush didn’t wait for congressional approval to commit troops in the Gulf Kuwait. Similarly, President Bill Clinton chose not to listen to Congress regarding the intervention in Kosovo. In recent years, President Obama felt that he did not need any authorization from Congress in either the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011 or our action in Syria.
Furthermore, Obama himself was found to be making final decisions on unilaterally authorized drone strikes and targeted killings—all under the shadow of the war on terrorism.
The simple truth is that the American presidency has accumulated an enormous amount of raw firepower in it. The ability to authorize drone strikes, launch nuclear missiles, or commit troops is all vested in the presidency, and over the years, the checks on this power by Congress have eroded and been loosened. In his speech on drone policy, President Obama himself acknowledged the potential executive misuse of targeted killings and has called for a greater congressional oversight on drone operations.
It has long been taken for granted that the American president would be morally prudent. Given the choices we have, and Donald Trump in particular, that conventional wisdom has to be let go. At some point in summer, Donald J. Trump commandeered the vote of a plurality of the American population. If the election were held that day, Trump could have possibly won. And the presidency, with all its power, would belong to him to fool around.
It has, therefore, become imperative that we revisit the question: how do we prevent or at least minimize the damage done by a potentially reckless, belligerent, and hawkish president?
Democracy has never been free from the threat of demagogues. And this is certainly not the first time—nor the last—that demagogues have held power or have come close to holding it. However, the salient feature of democratic systems is that they prevent unconstitutional usage of power, or dramatic deviations from acceptable policy norms. A robust democracy acknowledges the demagogic threat to the democracy and tries to limit, with constitutional balances and checks, the damage a demagogue could possibly do.
Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers, “If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.” Men and women—even the best—are vulnerable to impulses, to biases, to greed and to recklessness. Robust constitutional checks and balances are required to make democratic systems impervious to someone like Donald J. Trump. The reason the prospect of a Trump presidency is frightening is the kind of potentially devastating things he could do with the power vested in the current executive.
The task at hand is to reassert the weakened checks to the power of presidency. A democratic society cannot put its trust in the good faith and moral prudence of its leaders and elected representatives. Democratic systems have to be designed to be impervious from the threats of belligerent demagogues. Though we can never get rid of demagoguery, we can, however, reinforce our state structure to restrain such a demagogue from coming to power or to minimize the potential damage such a demagogue could breed—the first step of which will be to rethink the amount of power vested in the commander-in-chief. As it stands now, I don’t think anyone should have that amount of power. Not Trump, not even Clinton.Pradeep Niroula ’18, is a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Quincy House.

Anyone who has taken a walk around Harvard Square recently understands the severity of its homelessness problem. Dozens of homeless people live and sleep on the streets in the shadow of the world’s wealthiest university. It is an issue that plagues not only the immediate surroundings of our University, but also much of the city of Cambridge. While there are a number of homeless shelters in the area—including the student-run Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y Harvard Square—the magnitude of the problem goes beyond their means, especially given the surge in homelessness in the Boston area in recent years. In mid-June of 2015, Boston mayor Marty Walsh released a plan for tackling homelessness in the city, with goals of ending veteran homelessness by the end of 2015, and chronic homelessness in 2018. Despite substantial progress, the former goal has not been met; the latter appears infeasible.
It is clear that homelessness is a persistent and pervasive problem in the Boston and Cambridge areas; it is also clear that the phenomenon is extraordinarily difficult and complex. There exists no panacea—instead, programs aimed at providing housing, increasing employment, and improving dignity for the homeless must be implemented in parallel to address the myriad factors that contribute to homelessness.
For example, the installation and opening of a public toilet last winter in Harvard Square directly addressed the need for bathrooms which had arisen from Christ Church’s decision to close its restrooms to public use. Similarly, the groundbreaking “There’s a Better Way” program, which seeks to provide panhandlers with employment and is currently under consideration by the Cambridge City Council, has proven to be an effective means of reaching out to those who are homeless and seeking employment. The dignity provided by both the Harvard Square bathroom and gainful employment is vital.
The best approaches are oftentimes multidimensional: The most crucial component of the "There's a Better Way" program for instance, is the fact that it seeks to use these work opportunities to connect the homeless with social services.
While innovative solutions such as these are important, we also must recognize that homelessness is a multifaceted problem.There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some chronically homeless people struggle to find work, and a program targeted at providing them daily work could be effective. Many others, however, have found employment and would benefit most from a housing-first approach.
After all, the best way to help the homeless is to end homelessness. Studies have shown that a housing-first approach is both cheaper and more effective in the long run. While we do not have access to Cambridge-specific data arguing that a housing-first approach to homelessness would be cheaper here as well, the data about its effectiveness almost certainly translates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last summer, I came up with an idea for The Great Chinese-American Novel.
To be honest, this is something that I have been mulling over for quite some time. I’ve always wanted to write The Great Chinese-American Novel, which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been done before. Chang-Rae Lee’s “Native Speaker” might be considered a close winner, if you can overlook the fact that most of the characters are Korean.
I first learned about the concept of the Great American Novel in my ninth grade language arts class. The “Great American Novel,” Mrs. Johnson explained—and there were many that different people considered to be equally “Great American”—was a work of fiction that captured the essence of American culture and, in doing so, dignified the unique American historical experience. Great, I thought—Totally on board with that definition. Then she gave us the laundry list of nominees—“Moby Dick,” “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” “The Great Gatsby,” “The Grapes of Wrath”—and I remember feeling a little disappointed that there were no Chinese characters in any of these works. Maybe, I thought, we should get our own Great Novel. That would only be fair, right?
Looking back, the real reason why I wished for a Great Chinese-American Novel was because I wanted someone else to do the work of figuring out what it meant to be Chinese-American for me. Upper middle-class Chinese America, and especially the immigrant version, is a pretty unglamorous place. It’s mostly a lot of potlucks, piano lessons, and mild corporal punishment—a culture so steeped in humility, frugality, and Confucian virtue that it simply cannot accommodate the concept of a “mid-life crisis.” For the longest time, I struggled to put all the pieces together, until I had the good fortune of being sent off to boarding school in New England, where I promptly forgot I was yellow.
That is, until embarrassingly recently, at Harvard, when I took a class called “Asian-American Literature.” As a result of my schooling, I often feel like an Asian guy pretending to be a white guy pretending to be an Asian guy. Now if only there was an authoritative Great Chinese American Novel I could use as a mirror or crystal ball, to point to and say Aha! That is me, and I am that.
Anyway, here is my prospectus for anyone who does want to write the thing. Feel free to use part or all of this. My protagonist’s name is Michael Wang, and he is an unremarkable and somewhat repressed 26-year-old software engineer at a huge tech company in San Francisco. Michael lives in Chinatown because the rent is too high anywhere else. But the thing is, he feels out of place amongst all the other immigrants running their restaurants and laundry services, who, for some reason, all seem way more Chinese than he does.
Michael never gets promoted above the bamboo ceiling, so his days are filled with ennui. And then one day, this woman (named Vivian, of course) from a rival Chinese company shows up from Beijing and tricks Michael into falling in love with her. Her plan is to recruit him to work as a double agent, stealing his company’s intellectual property. She pays Michael a lot of money, and he gets to work. He experiences a jarring mix of emotions: self-loathing and disgust, alongside spite and excitement. He starts flying to Beijing a lot, with Vivian, who takes him on wild and crazy adventures through the city. Inevitably, these trips leave a paper trail, and before long the theft is exposed. Vivian disappears, abandoning Michael, who changes his name and retires into obscurity in Chengdu, where he meets a foreign tourist and tells this story.
Maybe to you this prospectus, this skeleton of a story, feels somewhat confused or arbitrary. Why Michael, why Vivian? Why Chengdu (reason: because it’s where I was born, and because nowhere else in China feels more remote to me)? In keeping with the theme of the tale I should admit that its central idea—that espionage is the metaphor for the Asian-American experience—was stolen from no other than Chang Rae Lee himself. But anyone who hasn’t read him probably isn’t ready to write this story yet.
From what I can tell so far, this plot line is missing at least a few things: for example, the Gold Rush, railroads, and Triad violence. So the challenge will be how to incorporate all of it in a plausible way. I’m thinking time travel is probably your best bet, but please make sure the inventor went to UC Berkeley.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 23, 2016, at 2:15 a.m.
Harvard Management Company lost almost $2 billion in endowment value during a “disappointing” fiscal year 2016, posting its worst endowment returns since the nadir of the financial crisis and marking the latest in a string of underwhelming investment results for the world’s largest university endowment.
The negative 2 percent returns, which HMC announced Thursday evening, bring the endowment’s total value to $35.7 billion, down from its $37.6 billion value at the end of fiscal year 2015. Beyond the poor investment returns, several financial flows affect the endowment's value, including the $1.7 billion HMC distributed to fund Harvard's over a third of the Harvard's annual budget.
Repeatedly characterized as “disappointing” in interim CEO Robert A. Ettl’s annual endowment report, the returns come during a difficult year for large institutional investors, particularly universities, amid volatile global markets. Still, the University’s investment arm fell short of its internal benchmark of returning 1 percent on its endowment—equivalent to hundreds of millions of dollars—during the turbulent fiscal year, which ended on June 30.
In his report, Ettl attributed the loss in part to the “low interest rate environment and market volatility of the past fiscal year,” but he also acknowledged that HMC’s internal performance was also to blame.
“[W]e recognize that execution was also a key factor in this year’s disappointing results,” he wrote.
Ettl became the interim CEO of HMC in late May when Stephen Blyth took a then-temporary medical leave of absence; Blyth eventually resigned as CEO in July after only 18 months in the position. The University continues to search for Blyth’s permanent replacement and is considering at least two higher education investment professionals to next lead HMC. 
This year’s returns represent the largest dollar loss on the endowment since fiscal year 2009 when the financial crisis drained almost $11 billion from Harvard’s coffers. Fiscal year 2016 marks the first time Harvard has lost money on its investments since fiscal year 2012, when it returned a negative 0.05 percent.
The negative returns—and failure to reach many internal benchmarks—follow several difficult years for HMC. Last year, Harvard earned 5.8 percent on its investments, meeting many internal goals but falling short of the returns at several peer institutions and drawing the concern of University President Drew G. Faust. It was Blyth’s first, and only, full fiscal year leading HMC.
In fiscal year 2016, several asset classes fell short of internal investment benchmarks. The public equity and natural resources asset classes performed particularly poorly, and the fixed income and absolute return classes failed to meet HMC’s expectations.
HMC’s natural resources portfolio—which composes 10 percent of Harvard’s total investments and has been a strong performer for the firm in recent years—posted losses of 10.2 percent, falling short of their 1.4 percent goal by a full 11.6 percentage points. In the report, Ettl cited “unfavorable market and business conditions across two assets in South America” as cause for the poor performance. The University owns a number of  timber plantations in Argentina, among other investments.
Public equity assets, which make up 29 percent of the total endowment, also fell 10.2 percent in value, failing to meet a negative 6.1 percent benchmark. One of the fastest growing asset classes last year, public equities returns are now prompting HMC to reconsider how it conducts investments in that area.
“We have repositioned our public equity strategy to rely more heavily on external managers,” Ettl wrote in the report.
HMC is unique in the endowment world for splitting its investments between both internal staff members and external management firms in what it calls a “hybrid model”—the Yale Investment Office, in comparison, relies much more heavily on outside managers. According to the report, though, HMC is transitioning away from the model it pioneered, reducing the size of its internal team and focusing on a “core group of top managers.”
The 2016 financial report is half the length of last year’s, which included a letter from then-CEO Blyth detailing his plans to “reinvigorate” HMC. Some of Blyth’s proposals, like tying manager compensation to overall fund performance, are now in the works; others will be left to the firm’s next CEO to implement or not.
HMC lost billions in investments as the University aims to raise billions in donations durings its capital campaign. Earlier this month, Harvard announced that it had raised more than $7 billion during its capital campaign, breaking a higher education record and far surpassing the University’s $6.5 billion goal. Many of the donations Harvard receives are invested into the endowment. 
Some of Harvard’s peer institutions have so far outpaced the University but posted weak results of their own, with MIT’s endowment returning 0.8 percent and the University of Pennsylvania taking a 1.4 percent loss. Other peer institutions have not yet posted  their returns for the 2016 fiscal year.
While “disappointing,” the endowment results were not unexpected: University President Drew G. Faust warned of the possibility of poor returns in an interview with the University-run Harvard Gazette last week, and a number of other large university endowments have posted losses this year.
Looking forward, Ettl wrote that he felt “confident about the moves we have made to reposition the portfolio,” but tempered expectations for high returns in coming years.
“As we enter fiscal year 2017, the investment landscape continues to be full of uncertainty,” Ettl wrote. “With a backdrop of slowing growth and rich valuations, endowment returns could be muted for some time to come.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: September 23, 2016
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated  that HMC's natural resources portfolio fell short of its benchmark by 11.6 percent. In fact, it fell short by 11.6 percentage points.

The Cambridge Queen’s Head, a student-operated pub, is hosting parties for students from each class year in an effort to create more College-sanctioned social events for undergraduates.
The events mark the first time the Queens Head, the Annenberg-basement venue, has organized events specifically for sophomores and juniors. The pub has hosted parties for freshmen during Opening Days and events for seniors, such as senior bar.
Though targeted to certain graduating classes, the events are open to all undergraduates.
Queen’s Head manager Shelby L. Raglan ’13 is spearheading the initiative, which emerged from conversations she had this summer with the Office of Student Life and the Undergraduate Council.
“We really badly wanted to give opportunities for students to come back and have a social event, or a place to hang out, that was... pretty easy to program, but would also help build community among some of our students,” Raglan said.
She said she thought the sophomore and junior events were worthwhile, though their turnouts were low.
“For me, any time I get students in the space it’s successful,” Raglan said.
Sophia M. Kaufman ’18, a junior who attended her class party, said despite the low attendance, she appreciated the pub’s effort to bring students together.
“I think that the premise of having something to bring our class together is really amazing and really nice, and there’s not a lot of time that we get to all spend together,” she said.
UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, whose election platform last year emphasized promoting inclusivity on campus, said he is excited to see the Queen’s Head develop broad programming.
“The Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub is one factor in a larger College discussion on how do we open social space,” he said. “And I think that the pub can be instrumental in creating inclusive events for the student body.”
He credited Raglan and the pub’s student managers with doing “an incredible job of coordinating with the Office of Student Life and the Undergraduate Council to get as many students in there as possible.”
Assistant of Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller wrote in a statement that the Office of Student Life, which oversees the pub, “is excited to partner with students in creating opportunities where students can celebrate their affinity to their class year.”
The Queens Head parties are the latest effort on the part of the College to take greater control over undergraduate social life and where it takes place, all the while hoping to curb the influence of off-campus social organizations such as final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. A group of women's organizations at the College are organizing the second iteration of the [BLANK] party this week, with the help of University president Drew G. Faust.
The next Pub event, the senior class party begins Saturday at 6 p.m. with an educational beer school and tasting, pub games, and karaoke, Raglan said.
Banks encouraged students to attend, in the hope of making the events occur on a more frequent basis.
“It’ll depend on how many people show up. So, I guess, vote with your feet,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten laptops, together worth thousands of dollars, were stolen from dorm rooms across campus last weekend, and the Harvard University Police Department continues its investigation.
The laptops were stolen last weekend in Canaday Hall and Stoughton Hall in Harvard Yard as well as in Adams House, Mather House and Leverett House, according to the HUPD crime log. The laptops were valued between $800 and $3,500 each. Nine of the 10 thefts occurred the night of Sept. 16.
Leverett resident Alec C. McNiff ’18 learned that his iPad was stolen Friday evening, while his roommates had lost their laptops.
“It was this past Friday, which was the day of the Harvard versus [the University of Rhode Island] football game. Myself and all my roommates went to the tailgates,” McNiff said. “None of us really returned to the room until around midnight.”
McNiff said that the door to his room had been propped open by a hanger and that the next morning his roommates could not find their laptops. They immediately began searching the room—but to no avail.
“Once we ransacked our room and found nothing we contacted HUPD and they said they’d get on it,” McNiff said.
Adam L. Chiavacci ’18, another Leverett resident and one of McNiff’s roommates, woke up on Saturday morning to find his laptop missing and soon realized his roommates had lost their electronics as well. They filed a report with HUPD soon after.
McNiff said he and his roommates have not heard anything from HUPD since they filed their report. According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, the investigation into the multiple thefts is still ongoing.
Chiavacci said the lack of computer was an inconvenience, but he was not afraid that someone had entered his room.
“I don’t feel like I would be in any danger, but it’s rough all together that they stole my computer,” he said.
River Houses have in recent years had high rates of electronics theft. HUPD officials have often advised students not to prop open doors and to monitor who follows them into their dormitories.
Paul J. Hegarty, Leverett’s building manager, wrote in an emailed statement that thefts like these are frightening but preventable.
“No one ever thinks they are going to get robbed, so they prop their door open or they hide their key in an obvious location near the door.” Hegarty wrote. “In a rush, people do not pay attention and even hold the door open for robbers trying to get in.”
“It’s been a hassle,” Chiavacci said. “I guess that I’ve got to start locking my doors now.”
Hegarty stressed that the convenience of propping doors is not worth the potential for theft and trespassing.
“I care about their property but property can always be replaced. I care more about the people in my buildings,” Hegarty wrote. “If you lock your doors then you greatly reduce the chance you will be robbed.”

Harvard lost almost $2 billion dollars in endowment value this year. Here’s what that means, why it matters, and an analysis of why it may have happened.
Harvard’s endowment is the $35.8 billion sum of money the University invests in a variety of financial markets; it’s the largest university endowment in the world. With the proceeds of those investments, Harvard uses the endowment to fund a number of operating costs and programs and ensure that Harvard will have that source of funding for the foreseeable future. No, it’s not one giant bank account that can be spent however Harvard pleases: The endowment is actually around 13,000 individual funds, the overwhelming majority of which are restricted in some way, that are invested collectively in a variety of assets.
The University takes a percentage of the money from these thousands of invested funds—about 5 percent of it every year—and uses it to fund Harvard programs. It’s Harvard Management Company’s job to oversee these funds and grow the endowment—in effect, to put more money in Harvard’s pocket through returns on investment.
Any first semester Economics concentrator can tell you about the beauty of financial growth; as Harvard’s endowment grows bigger, that 5 percent that it gives to University operations every year becomes an increasingly large sum. As the endowment grows, so does Harvard’s capacity to fund research, financial aid, House renewal, and the like.
About a third of Harvard’s annual operating budget comes from the endowment; this year, it contributed around $1.7 billion to Harvard, or over a third of the University’s entire operating budget. That spending supports all the vital functions of the University, from professorships to the library collection to financial aid. Harvard’s 12 schools are funded by the endowment to different extents: The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, for example, received about 50 percent of its funding from the endowment last year, while the School of Public Health—many of its expenses provided for by a $350 million gift from 2014—only took 15 percent of its budget from the endowment.
While $35.8 billion may seem like a whole lot of money—and it is—endowment losses can still make an impact on the day-to-day operations of the University. For instance, after the world economy crumbled in 2008, Harvard’s endowment took an $11 billion plunge, losing over a quarter of its value. The University was forced to make sharp cuts to its budget, laying off hundreds of employees and cutting student services. For example, hot breakfast still hasn’t returned to the Houses.
In short: donations. Earlier this month, the University announced it had raised over $7 billion so far in its current capital campaign, passing its goal years ahead of schedule and breaking a higher education record.
When someone gives money to Harvard, they’ll often target it to a certain program or initiative, like a new professorship. Because both Harvard and the donor want these new programs or research efforts to exist for more than a single year, Harvard invests the donor’s money. The idea is that the University can grow the sum the donor gave Harvard and use that earned money to fund the program or effort forever—in perpetuity. (Not that every donation goes into the endowment, though: some donors choose to fund more specific short-term projects.)
Of course, the returns on these donations can soon begin to overshadow the donations themselves, so the endowment is a mix of recent gifts and decades-old money earned by investing donations. In her September 2014 financial report, Jane Mendillo, the then-CEO of HMC, wrote: “the value of $1,000 invested alongside the Harvard endowment in 1994 would have been more than $10,000 at the end of fiscal year 2014.”
Because the endowment is heavily supported by donors, per Massachusetts law, Harvard has to follow the rules and conditions that those donors place on their gifts. And many of those gifts have strings attached; last year, 84 percent of the endowment—about $31 billion—had restrictions on how it could be used. That still leaves 16 percent of a multi-billion dollar endowment unrestricted, but oftentimes, donors specify the school they want their gifts to fund. Discretionary funds do exist, though, allowing University President Drew G. Faust to fund projects like [BLANK] Party and the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration.
This point is debatable. In recent years, Harvard’s returns have trailed peer institutions, and HMC’s investment practices are falling under increasing scrutiny. HMC employs a unique “hybrid” investment model, which means that it employs both in-house and external money managers. Yale, by contrast, employs mostly outside managers, and some financial experts say it can be easier to shift investment strategies when not tied to an internal team. Plus, Harvard has to pay its finance executives competitively with leading hedge firms, and those salaries add up quickly.
Others have pinned poor returns on HMC’s recent revolving door. The University’s investment arm is looking for its fourth CEO in 10 years, and every new chief executive brings his or her own ideas to the job. That kind of strategic whiplash can be dangerous when endowment investments rely on a consistent, steady hand, some experts say.
To be sure, fiscal year 2016 was a bad one for the global economy and the university endowments it affects; about a dozen public universities with large endowments have posted losses so far this year, and the University of Pennsylvania reported negative 1.4 percent returns today. Even MIT, a rising star in the higher education investment world, posted 0.8 percent returns and was outpaced by the S&P 500 Index this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the undergraduate group Student Labor Action Movement and several Harvard University Dining Services employees made speeches and held informational sessions in three College dining halls Thursday night to gather support for HUDS’ recent vote to authorize a strike.
Last week, HUDS workers voted 591-18 to authorize a strike should the University not comply with their demands for increased minimum salaries and different health care benefits.
SLAM members set up tables in Hillel, Quincy, and Mather dining halls to discuss the potential HUDS strike and to encourage student involvement, asking diners to remain quiet momentarily while they spoke. Students also passed out fliers and small buttons reading "Support the strike."
In each of the dining halls, a HUDS worker stood up and gave a personal testimonial to dining students.
Robert A. James, a cook in Quincy dining hall, spoke on behalf of HUDS workers during the teach-in at Quincy to express concern about proposed changes to HUDS insurance benefits.
“I’m a father with a beautiful five-and-a-half-year-old girl,” he said. “But when we gave birth to our daughter, there were some complications. It ended up being an ordeal that lasted for five days.”
He added that, because of his previous health coverage through HUDS, he was able to afford the procedures his wife and daughter needed. He claimed the proposed health care package from the University may increase what he would need to pay for such procedures.
According to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga, the average HUDS employee would likely see an increase in cost “of less than $11/month under the plan Harvard has proposed.”
Connecting his personal anecdote to the HUDS strike authorization, James said that most HUDS workers are “only two paychecks away from abject poverty.”
“With housing rents as expensive as they are in Boston, you’ll definitely feel that pinch,” he said. “It’s just not fair.”
In a statement, deLuzuriaga wrote that “Harvard’s dining workers currently receive highly competitive wages that lead the local and national workforce for comparable positions in the foodservice industry.”
In each dining hall, SLAM organizers stressed the importance of the student body’s involvement in supporting strike efforts.
Grace F. Evans ’19, who helped organize the Mather tables, said it was not a coincidence the teach-ins were held on Thursday, which is community dinner night at the College. “It’s a great time to talk about our community and those who are vulnerable in it,” she said.
Echoing Evans, Anastacia M. Valdespino ’18 said hosting the teach-ins during community dinner “really offers the chance for the House system to be a built-in organization that is supporting [HUDS strike].”
According to Valdespino, SLAM had been collaborating with UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents HUDS, in organizing the teach-ins.
“We’ve had a union rep who has been giving us a lot of information,” she said, noting that the group's handouts for the sessions were made by a former SLAM member who has since joined Local 26.
According to Valdespino, SLAM intends to host teach-ins in each of the remaining undergraduate dining halls over the next couple of weeks.

Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard Kennedy School’s Middle East Initiative celebrated Palestinian schoolteacher Hanan Al Hroub as the second recipient of the Global Teacher Prize in a discussion Thursday night.
The prize, which is funded through the Varkey Foundation, provides Al Hroub with $1 million that she plans to invest in providing teachers with resources to nurture students in at-risk areas.
The event, which was held in both English and Arabic as part of the Education School's  Askwith forum seminars, explored Al Hroub’s work in using creative teaching methods to combat emotional trauma and violence. Fernando M. Reimers, a professor at the GSE, moderated the discussion with Al Hroub.
Al Hroub’s efforts to support traumatized children in areas prone to violence began with the recovery of her own two children after they witnessed a shooting in which their father was injured.
"The main factor was that I became the instructor, or teacher, of my own children because I could not find assistance from academia or my own government… I put myself in the shoes of other people in similar circumstances and I wanted to help,” Al Hroub said through a translator.
Both Al Hroub and Reimers agreed that a quality education extends beyond the classroom to help students develop self-awareness and social skills.
“My methodology is not just to combat violence, but to remedy creativity,” Al Hroub said, explaining her use of creative games in the classroom.
Varkey Foundation chief executive and visiting practitioner at the GSE Vikas Pota described the Global Teacher Prize as “a way of galvanizing conversation and… showing the magic [teachers] perform in their classrooms to lots and lots of people.”
Al Hroub was chosen by an international panel of 177 educational leaders.
Following the event, Al Hroub gave advice for students seeking to create positive change in society.
“Each one of us, whatever we are, whatever we do, has a role to play in international peace,” she said. “Regardless of your role, your position, regardless of your profession, start today.”

Last week, Harvard’s dining hall workers voted overwhelmingly in favor of a strike after more than three months of stagnant contract talks. But this is not the first time UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that represents HUDS employees, has brandished the threat of a strike in the face of static negotiations.
Harvard’s dining workers have threatened to strike at least seven times since the 1930s, when the University first began negotiations with bargaining units across campus. Of those, they have only executed three strikes. The last walkout occurred in 1983 when Harvard announced it intended to hire outside contractors in the dining halls.
According to Brian Lang, the current president of Local 26, if HUDS does strike, it will mark the first time the union does so during the academic year. In the past, the strikes occurred during Harvard’s recesses, only minimally affecting the daily operations of the University.
HUDS has been bargaining with the Harvard for the past three months, and its contract was extended in mid-June. The contract included a no-strike clause that expired, when the contract did, on Sept 17.  Members of Local 26 voted 591-18 in favor of striking if the talks have not progressed by the next scheduled bargaining session on Sept. 27.
All of Harvard’s nine unions have often employed different negotiation tactics with the University. While in the past, Local 26 has shown an inclination towards threatening strike, Harvard’s largest union, Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical, has not generally done so.
Though their most recent talks with the University were lengthy, HUCTW members did not put forth a strike vote. In an interview last winter, Donene M. Williams, a member of the negotiation team for HUCTW, credited this to the bargaining units’ willingness to collaborate.
“It wasn’t just a simple conversation of the University saying ‘Here, we’d like to take this’ and us saying ‘no thanks,’” Williams said. “It was a lot more nuanced than that. There was a lot of discussion about why the University believed it would be a great idea for everyone to be on the same plan, and we didn’t disagree with that—we just didn’t believe that it was the right plan.”
Lang said he thinks a similar tone of mutual respect is missing from Local 26’s current discussions with the University.
“It’s been our experience that when we sit down with employers who are willing to take a genuinely collaborative approach, and are willing to treat each other as equals, we’ve been able to come up with solutions,” Lang said, adding that a strike could be averted if the union feels Harvard “genuinely” approaches the remainder of the negotiations as a collaborative effort.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement that Harvard is “committed to bargaining in good faith towards an agreement that recognizes our colleagues’ important contributions while supporting the University’s core mission of research, teaching and learning.”

Offering accounts of unethical clinical trials, University of Minnesota professor Carl Elliott warned students and faculty at Harvard Medical School Thursday night about the dangers of mixing healthcare and business.
Elliott, a bioethicist and doctor at the University of Minnesota, spoke about his recent book “White Coat, Black Hat: Adventures on the Dark Side of Medicine,” which critiques the increasing role that big businesses play in medicine.
“What happens when you turn medicine into a business?” Dr. Elliott said. “Well, what happens is that you get a lot of scams and swindles and con artists.”
Elliott said he was motivated to pursue his research after reading a 2005 industry-funded drug study that raised bioethics concerns. He argues that in the study, the University of Minnesota coerced a 26-year-old psychiatric patient, Dan Markingson, into participating in a clinical trial despite repeated objections from his mother, who said that her son would commit suicide because of the medication. Markingson died by suicide a few months later.
The University of Minnesota has continued to defend its research, claiming that no evidence has been found that Markingson was coerced into the study. Still, Elliott has demanded that the school acknowledge that it was responsible for Markingson’s death.
After Elliott’s speech, Robert D. Truog, a professor at Harvard Medical School, also acknowledged flaws in many clinical trials. He claimed that many scientists involved in pharmaceutical-funded trials manipulate data analysis for outcomes that they want to see.
“Those involved have lost the principles of scientific ethics, which is a real dedication to scientific integrity,” he said.
In an interview, Jon W. Boyd, an organizer of the event and a professor at Harvard Medical School, commended Elliott for his research.
“The public service that I see [Elliott] doing is to educate the public about medical issues,” he said.
Boyd also said he hoped that, through the presentation, audience members would be exposed to the relationship between medicine and business “so that they can try to help effect change for the better.”
Adil Menon, a graduate student in bioethics who attended the event, felt that Elliott’s work has changed his perspective on bioethics.
“[Reading Elliott’s book] forced me to start questioning things that I had taken for granted before and to realize that medicine is great but it does have issues that need to be exposed, that need to be addressed,” he said.

By next year, Harvard will likely complete the renovation of Grays Hall basement into a dedicated space for the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity and the BGLTQ Office.
According to Director of Diversity and Inclusion Programs Loc Truong, the timeframe for the renovations is “still being assessed.” Truong added that the College has yet to allocate a budget for the project.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life and Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion are currently located on in temporary offices at 7 Linden St.
The Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and BGLTQ Offices held its first town hall Thursday to solicit feedback from undergraduates about the renovations. Truong said the town hall will be one of many. Approximately two dozen College administrators, undergraduates, and recent alumni attended the meeting.
“I think that our students’ needs are changing,” Truong said. “We need to listen to what their needs are to create a kind of space that not only BGLTQ students are looking for, but all students.”
The project’s architects, Kennedy and Violich Architecture, were also present at the meeting to take note of suggestions for the new space. The firm is responsible for a handful of recent Harvard architecture projects, including the Women’s Center, the Tozzer anthropology building, and Holworthy basement.
Multiple students suggested that the College and the project’s architects ensure that the new space is welcoming to students. Some suggested that the basement room be open 24/7, and others discussed decorating the space with queer imagery and feminist quotes.
These proposed changes come at a time of transition for the Office of Student Life, the umbrella organization that oversees the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and BGLTQ Offices. Since the beginning of the year, the Office of Student Life has dealt with high-level of turnover.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair recently took over as the head of the Office of Student Life, replacing Stephen Lassonde, who left his post last spring. Former Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life Van Bailey left the post over the summer, and Assistant Dean of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña will depart in October. While the College begins a search for Bailey’s replacement, freshman proctor Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 is serving as the office’s interim director. O’Dair will temporarily take over dela Peña’s duties.
The changes in leadership also come at a time when the College is working to implement a series of reforms released by a diversity working group last November, which emphasized creating open spaces for students with diverse backgrounds and identities. A University-wide task force on sexual assault re-emphasized this concern and drew attention to the high rates of sexual assault in the BGLTQ community.
“As you know, space is really hard to come by,” Truong said. “But we want to make sure that the space we have for these two offices are centrally located and accessible to all students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­For the past few weeks, little pressure has been on the backs of the Harvard women’s volleyball team. Over the course of its non-conference schedule, Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss experimented with different lineups and positional alignments, veterans had an opportunity to shake off the summer rust, and new players had precious time to try to integrate into the existing team, all with little consequences on a macro level.
When it comes to gaining a bid to the NCAA Tournament, its chances of doing so at-large are slim. So, in the broad scheme of things, the results of those games did not matter.
That all changes on Friday.
Harvard (2-7) travels to Hanover on Friday to start its conference slate against Dartmouth (6-4), officially marking the beginning of the Crimson’s quest for an Ivy League three-peat.
“We all are super excited,” sophomore Christina Cornelius said. “We’ve practiced so hard this whole preseason and we’ve had a lot of games that have prepared us for our season.”
When Harvard takes the floor in New Hampshire at this week’s end, the same team that stole a set from the eventual national champion Nebraska in the NCAA Tournament last December will not be taking the court.
“We have a lot of raw talent,” co-captain Corie Bain said. “But it’s not like filling in the blanks with erasing a whiteboard and rewriting it.”
Most notably, instead of trotting out four experienced seniors, the team is defined by its youth. Now, four freshmen will see significant playing time.
After nine games, two of the top three players in kills per set were freshmen: Grace Roberts Burbank and Maclaine Fields.
Freshman Isabelle Tashima has ownership of the libero position entering the Big Green contest. A lone senior in Bain leads the Crimson into Ivy League play.
“The learning curve thus far is incredibly large,” Bain said. “I think [the freshmen] have handled it really well.”
Only one year removed from notching four conference wins, Dartmouth found itself only one win outside of the top of Ivy League when last season came to a close.
The Big Green’s resurgence was led by now-senior co-captain Emily Astarita, who nabbed All-Ivy First Team honors in her junior year. The Setauket, N.Y., native led the league in kills per set, averaging 3.92 per frame over the course of last year’s campaign.
The team was also buoyed by Paige Caridi, whose kills per set also put her in the top ten in the Ancient Eight at season’s end. But, the outside hitter graduated in June, leaving Dartmouth with a significant amount of offensive output to replace. The Big Green does still have its leading blocker in co-captain Kaira Lujan.
Harvard also returns its top blocker in Cornelius, who also happened to be the Ivy League top blocker per set, finishing her rookie campaign with 1.55 en route to being named Ivy League Rookie of the Year and being voted onto the All-Ivy First Team. But this year, she’s adopted a heavier role off the court as well.
“She leads by example,” Bain said. “She’s very good at knowing what to say…. She goes into it very confidently, and I think confidence is the number one determinant of leadership.”
Junior Paige Kebe has also returned to an increased workload, leading the team in attacks thus far.
While Dartmouth’s record is floating above .500 as Harvard only boasts two wins, there was no common opponent between the two teams.
The Crimson’s poor record to this point was in large part a function of the level of talent that the Crimson went up against early in the season.
Harvard has dropped its last two season openers, both to Dartmouth. The Crimson did go on to sweep the Big Green on the road in a crucial midseason matchup to keep pace with Princeton.
“We always have a pretty good game against [Dartmouth],” Cornelius said. “The two games that we played against them last year were really good games…. We’re focusing on us, our strengths and our weaknesses, and just trying to improve on everything we can before we go into the game on Friday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard men’s soccer team looks to rebound from a turbulent California road trip this Saturday as it concludes its away portion of pre-Ivy League play, visiting Iona. The Crimson (2-3-1) squares off against the Gaels (1-6-0) for the first time since being shutout in its 2013 home opener.
“We’re looking to be confident going in,” Harvard senior forward Jake Freeman remarked. “After last weekend, we want to get back to our winning ways… and start peaking at the right time going into the Ivy League season.”
The Crimson is still in search of its first road victory of the year. Iona is in a similar position on the heels of four consecutive losses, and will look to make a statement against an opponent that it rarely sees in Harvard.
Both teams seek to rectify their less-than-impressive defensive showings in recent games. The Crimson ‘s back line, anchored by junior goalkeeper Kyle Parks, will turn its focus to locking down Iona’s forward ensemble after conceding a combined nine goals across two matches last weekend.
Likewise, the Gaels, allowing over two goals per game in 2016, have been outscored 9-3 by opponents during their four-game losing streak.
“After that kind of performance, you just want to get back to the fundamentals and try to get back to our identity of a team who is just going to battle and compete no matter what the score is,” Freeman said. “We’re trying to buckle down defensively.”
Parks, despite Harvard’s latest defensive struggles, boasts two clean sheets on the season, having posted a 1.77 goals-against average and .738 save percentage. Crimson opponents over that span, however, have put up an impressive 0.96 GAA. Iona’s rather permeable defense manifests itself more directly in its goaltender’s numbers: sophomore Kellar Sirstins surely hopes to remedy his middling 2.14 GAA and .583 SV%.
Gaels junior forward Marcos Nunez, reigning MAAC Offensive Player of the Year, will certainly look to break down Harvard’s defensive efforts. The speedster has already registered two goals and two assists on the season and accounts for roughly one-third of Iona’s total shot attempts with 27.
On the other side of the pitch, Freeman has six points of his own, including a game-winning goal against Pac-12 foe Washington. Harvard has also received offensive contributions thus far in the form of two goals from freshman midfielder Matthew Glass, a goal and assist from sophomore forward Cesar Farias and co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu.
“It’s been a good diversity in terms of point-getting so far this year,” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “You prefer to see that rather than just depending on one person every single game.”
As the Gaels have mustered just a single goal in all first halves combined this season, the Crimson will look to capitalize early in the first half.
“We obviously want to see if we can come out with a fast start and try to play with a lead,” Freeman said. “When we have [played with a lead], we’ve won….We just need to focus on playing out the full 90 minutes.”
Despite Harvard’s apparent offensive advantage, Iona still trumps Harvard in multiple statistical signs of scoring success: the Gaels lead the Crimson in shot-on-goal percentage (.477 to .356) and shots per game (12.3 to 9.8).
These may be indicators that despite its struggles early in matches, Iona comes on strong in the latter half of games.
The Crimson can expect to see this pattern unfold on Saturday, so discipline and stamina become even more crucial to a Harvard victory.
The Crimson edges the Gaels in the disciplinary aspect of the game, amassing 12 total bookings this season—including no red cards—compared to Iona’s 19. Furthermore, look for Harvard to utilize its bench to ensure fresh legs to counter the anticipated late-match push from the Gaels.
“In regards to staying disciplined, we just need to continue to do what we do in terms of preparing,” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “And whenever anybody steps onto the field, we have complete confidence in their ability to perform…. Players one through 22 on our team are always ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heavy rests the crown for the 2016 Harvard football team.
After two decades of steady success and three especially acute years of dominance, the Crimson confronts a question common to all victors: What next?
Having won its last 15 road games, what land remains to be conquered? Having hoisted three straight league titles, what opponents remain to be vanquished?
No longer do Harvard players need to grab top-dog status; that happened in 2013, with the first Ivy League title.
Nor do they need to thwart criticisms of being a fluke success; that happened in 2014, with the second Ivy League title.
Nor do they need to buck odds and establish a dynasty; that happened in 2015, with the third Ivy League title.
Under the guidance of coach Tim Murphy, the Crimson has skipped from victory to victory, scoring at least 10 points in the last 62 games. Again in 2016 media pundits picked Harvard to top the Ancient Eight. But in its wake, the Crimson has left a trail of embittered opponents, all of them salivating at a chance for revenge.
Heavy rests the crown.
“We’re everybody’s rival,” Murphy said. “Everybody hates our guts. Because of that, you can never, ever, ever take anyone for granted.”
The crown weighs especially on senior Joe Viviano, anointed quarterback of Harvard’s offense.
He’s a large guy—6’5”, 220 pounds—but for three years, his stat line could fit into a fortune cookie. One pass thrown. No completions. No starts.
Last Friday rejiggered those numbers, as Viviano got the nod against Rhode Island and went 24-for-32 and 290 yards. Most noticeably, he scrambled for 51 yards—an upgrade over his solid but physically unexceptional predecessor, Scott Hosch.
Still, one battle doesn’t win a war. As a freshman, Viviano entered campus as the 51st quarterback in the nation according to ESPN. He carried heavy expectations, and four years later, those expectations linger.
A season ago, Viviano nearly won the first-string job in training camp before breaking his foot. Now the undisputed starter, he will try to exhibit the playmaking ability and cannon arm that attracted Murphy and other scouts.
It is a case of ability without experience, power without comfort. And there are no dry runs.
“I believe 100 percent in him,” captain Sean Ahern said. “He’s definitely ready.”
Similarly crucial is Ahern, a defensive back. He’s a fifth-year senior who plays like a fifth-year senior—calmly, quickly, and with physical dominance.
In the last two seasons, he has matched up against some of toughest opposing receivers and emerged both times as a member of the All-Ivy first team. Also a key special-teamer (he co-led the Ancient Eight with two blocked kicks last year), Ahern sets the temperament of the defense. He is the anchor, connecting Harvard to past seasons of defensive excellence.
“Sean’s a potential All-American,” Murphy said. “He’s one of the best corners we’ve ever had.”
Viviano and Ahern comprise two small parts of a larger team, one in which all players shoulder the duty of defending the Crimson’s dominion.
As a program, Harvard preaches a next-man-up philosophy—that no personnel loss is absolute because replacements always wait in the wings. Following the graduation of 15 starters and fourteen All-Ivy players, 2016 marks a test of this philosophy. The next man truly is up.
“Whatever our talent level is, that’s something we have no control over,” Murphy said. “But we can control what our character is. That’s what we hang our hat on.”
Last year, running back Paul Stanton Jr. capped off a historic career with an 809-yard season; this year rushers Semar Smith (junior), Charlie Booker (sophomore), and possibly others will share snaps. The by-committee approach worked against the Rams, as Harvard churned out 244 yards on the ground. But the deceptively physical Stanton will be missed when competing against Ivy League defensive lines.
Last year, the Crimson handled such defensive lines by trotting out senior offensive linemen Anthony Fabiano, Adam Redmond, and Cole Toner, all of whom signed NFL contracts at the end of the season; this year Harvard features less muscle and more youth upfront. While senior Max Rich and junior Larry Allen, Jr. provide some consistency, growing pains are inevitable.
A trio of seniors also staffed the linebacker unit during last year’s campaign, leading a defense that allowed a nation-low 84.4 rushing yards per contest; this year a number of fresh faces—especially juniors Luke Hutton and Chase Guillory—man the position. And the unit only got younger a week-and-a-half ago when senior Eric Ryan tore his meniscus, forcing the stalwart out of the lineup for the foreseeable future.
“We had a ton of huge parts of our defense graduate,” Ryan said. “A lot of young guys [are] filling the voids…. It’s been a huge preseason. We’ve been all in as a team.”
Amidst this roster transformation, it’s easy to overlook what remains the same. Two names stand out in particular: senior tight end Anthony Firkser and sophomore wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley.
Three of the Crimson’s last four tight ends have caught on as professional players, and Firkser has the potential to continue this trend. He’s a 230-pound race car with leather-soft hands.
Meanwhile, Shelton-Mosley is fast, period. Harvard freshmen rarely see significant game action, but last year the Sacramento, Ca. native totaled 1,140 yards and returned punts, including one for a score. Against Rhode Island, the game plan targeted Shelton-Mosley early and often, resulting in nine catches.
Both receiving threats eclipsed 100 yards that Friday night, perhaps prefiguring a season of a two-pronged aerial attack.
More than players, what remains the same are the fundamentals of the program. Wake up early and work hard. Exhibit character. And never, under any circumstances, let go of the ball.
That final commandment lays at the center of Harvard’s success. Murphy told the story of the 2003 Crimson, a potent offense that averaged 462 yards a game but finished 7-3 thanks to 19 turnovers. The next season, the coach abandoned all other metrics besides turnovers—and ended up finishing undefeated.
“Really the only benchmark we talk about as an offensive staff is ball security,” Murphy said. “If we have zero turnovers in every game, we will win every single game.”
These days, at the start of every season, all players receive a laminated sheet with personalized instructions for ball security. And since 2000, the team is 32-0 when not committing a turnover.
In 2016, the irony of this turnover emphasis is striking: A program that has nightmares about bad snaps and interceptions must face the greatest turnover of all—the loss of arguably the most dominant senior class of all time.
In the game of football, turnovers hurt because the ball changes possession; in the game of life, turnovers hurt because change challenges consistency.
The central question for the 2016 Crimson is whether the program can weather such a sea-shift. And there is only way to find out: by accompanying Harvard down the eight-game journey that starts at Brown on Friday, in the Ivy League season opener.
“We get everybody’s best shot,” Murphy said. “We’re going to be the team that plays the hardest every week. We’re going to be the team that is the grittiest…. It’s all about our identity as a program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati may be a Jesuit school, but on Friday nights, football reigns supreme.
Depending on the opponent, depending on the weather, up to 6,000 spectators pack into Ballaban Field—so named after a long-time coach—to watch their Bombers play. Blue-and-white battalions flash prepaid tickets, browse the in-stadium souvenir shop, juggle hot concessions, and finally settle in to root for a program that has captured two state titles in the last 11 years.
On the field, illuminated by enormous stadium lights, nearly 400 kids from St. Xavier shiver and sweat. They shoulder an enormous legacy, one that has produced at least 13 NFL players, including three-time Pro Bowler Luke Kuechly of the Carolina Panthers.
Here in southwest Ohio, football isn’t life-or-death. But it can be your life.
Sean Ahern, the 143rd captain of Harvard football, understands this fact. Put more simply: “Football is a big deal where I come from.”
Over the last two years, however, the converse has proven equally true—that where Sean Ahern comes from is a big deal for football. After all, it was Ballaban Field that shaped Ahern into who he is today, meaning a shutdown cornerback, a first-team All-Ivy selection for two straight years, and the bedrock of the Crimson’s defense.
“[I want to be] a high-energy guy,” Ahern said. “Someone who brings it every day. Someone who, once game day rolls around, is super-focused and locked in.”
Many of those ambitions took root at St. Xavier, a 184-year-old private school whose football program has enjoyed national prominence since the mid-2000s. In 2005, when the program claimed its first state championship, the city of Cincinnati established “St. Xavier High School Day.”
Part of St. Xavier’s success on the gridiron relates to pure size. Roughly a quarter of the 1,600-person, all-male student body joins the football team. About 120 players stick around as upperclassmen, making the high school squad one of the largest in the country.
Even before Ahern reached ninth grade, odds were that he’d join this army. His father played defensive back at Brown, coincidentally joining the Bears around the same time as Tim Murphy. Back then Murphy worked as a part-time assistant; now he’s the Harvard head coach.
College football left a real impact on Ahern’s father and, in turn, shaped his son.
“We bonded through [the sport] for many years,” Ahern said. “Still do. He’s definitely my number one fan.”
Despite his athletic lineage, however, Ahern didn’t think seriously about college football until recruiters started to call. The Crimson entered the fray during his junior year.
At that point, Ahern’s father adopted a new role. Previously a third-grade coach, constantly an enthusiastic supporter, he then evolved into a chief consultant.
“He’s been there throughout the whole process,” Ahern said. “He made me realize that there was a door out there to play football and get a good education.”
This, in short, was how Ahern ended up in a Harvard uniform. In 2012, he opened preseason at 175 pounds—20 pounds lighter than he is now.
College competition soon jolted to a stop, however. After appearing in the season opener, Ahern tore his pectoral muscle. Season over.
“It was definitely a challenging time being a freshman,” Ahern said. “The level of the game was just so much different, something I did not anticipate. And being hurt, I kind of felt separated from the team.”
Rehab relieved that sentiment. So did on-field success.
As a junior, Ahern started for the Crimson, leading the team with six pass break-ups as Harvard battled to an undefeated campaign. In the 2014 Game—yes, that epic 31-24 slugfest with the championship at stake—he had the best contest of his year, preventing two catches and recording seven tackles.
“Corners make their money, so to speak, by being great cover corners,” Murphy said. “He is that, but he’s a tough, physical guy. He plays physically like a safety with a corner’s ability.”
The next year, he returned as the top cover guy for a Crimson defense that allowed 13 points a game, the second-stingiest mark in the nation. On special teams, Ahern added another accolade: kick blocker par excellence. He rejected two boots to rank first in the Ancient Eight.
In both 2014 and 2015, postseason voters recognized this dominance, tapping Ahern for consecutive All-Ivy first teams.
These days, as a fifth-year senior, Ahern remains one of the few holdovers from last season’s overpowering unit. He mans a secondary short on experience, though not enthusiasm.
As of last fall, Ahern is also Harvard’s captain, the 11th straight defensive player to earn this post. (New York Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 was the last exception).
“He’s naturally taken to being the captain,” Murphy said. “He’s one of those guys that everyone respects…. He doesn’t mind holding his teammates accountable to the same high standards that he holds himself.”
As one might expect for a fifth-year player, these high standards reflect years of watching and playing alongside talented players. Ahern cited a number of defensive mates as role models, including linebacker Matt Koran ’16, defensive back Norman Hayes ’15, and defensive back D.J. Monroe ’13, who died last October.
Still, perhaps the most intense idol is the one who has accompanied Ahern during his entire journey, from Friday night epics at Ballaban Field to Saturday afternoon nail-biters at Harvard Stadium. Certainly Ahern’s father has seen a lot, including most Crimson contests over the past two seasons, and barring the intervention of injuries or fate, he stands to see nine more.
Much has passed between father and son in all these years, but at least one question remains unanswerable: Who’s the better player?
“Oh definitely me,” Ahern said. Then he paused, making sure that he got his words right. “He might’ve been a harder hitter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A simple Google search of “Harvard’s first football team” returns images of a collection of 13 rather ordinary looking college-aged men. If the inaugural 1873 team managed to transport itself to the 21st century and walked through the Yard, it would be a surprise if anyone managed to identify the members as football players from among the throngs of students and tourists.
Today, members of any collegiate football team are highly-trained athletic specimens. They are fine-tuned to do their specific job on the field, whether that be plugging up the gaps in the line or sprinting downfield to beat the secondary and make leaping catches.
Of course, hours upon hours of work in the gym are necessary to become physically dominant enough to compete in Division I football. To assure that the the Crimson football team is in the best possible shape it can be, coach Tim Murphy enlists James Frazier, Harvard’s Director of Strength and Conditioning.
Frazier’s work with the team over the offseason is designed to enhance the Crimson’s competitive advantage over its opponents, and the players clearly appreciate the dedication he brings to making them the best they can be.
“I respect the man a lot,” said senior defensive tackle Doug Webb. “He’s got a great staff alongside him. When you have little running backs and wide receivers squatting X-amount of weight, you know it’s pretty impressive.”
At Harvard, the vast majority of drills and lifts have a clear football-related focus. There is also a definite emphasis on injury prevention, which Webb calls “prehab.” Beginning the rehab process before injuries even occur and taking care of the extreme strains on the players’ bodies throughout the season goes a long way toward keeping everyone as healthy and in-shape as possible.
The main philosophy Frazier, Murphy, and the rest of the staff have on offseason workouts is using a diverse array of workouts to get the players accustomed to the grueling 10-week fall schedule. Speed training, lifting, and conditioning are all components of the weekly programs.
Although there is a great variation between the body type of an offensive lineman and a cornerback, for example, Frazier and his staff generally view all the players on the roster as football players. Training maturity is the biggest factor in the difference between different players’ workouts, as players will naturally progress through a series of four programs, one for each of their four years in Cambridge.
While the Crimson may not boast the same extravagant facilities as many top FBS schools, the Palmer Dixon Strength and Conditioning Center gets the job done for Harvard.
“Palmer Dixon, I absolutely love it,” Webb said. “I love how there’s a lot of room in there. I can get in there, get a good workout in, and call it a day.”
The strength and conditioning center across the river in Allston has a 24,000 square foot weight room and training facility, which the football team utilizes for team lifts both in-season and over the offseason.
“We have some of the best strength and conditioning facilities in the entire Ivy League,” Frazier claimed. “Harvard has done a great job in terms of supporting us, giving us the personnel and the people that we need.”
To incentivize going above and beyond during offseason workouts, Frazier and his staff recognize some of the top performers with “hard worker” awards. This offseason, senior defensive tackle Miles McCollum was the summer MVP, while sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley, junior safety Tobe Ezeokoli, sophomore cornerback Wesley Ogsbury, and senior offensive lineman Max Rich also made significant strides.
Even during the spring semester and during the eight weeks of training leading up to camp, the team holds early-morning lifts. The main motivation behind scheduling the sessions practically at the crack of dawn is building camaraderie and character.
“When you’re walking across that bridge at zero dark thirty and the wind chill is minus seven degrees, you’re going to have to be really committed,” Murphy said. “It strengthens the resolve of the kids who are really into reaching their potential.”
Personal fortitude and team bonding are two important by-products of early lifts; these intangibles translate to the field in tangible ways.
With the Crimson likely facing pressure from Ivy foes Penn and Dartmouth for the Ancient Eight championship, any slight edge will be instrumental to Harvard’s success or downfall this season. However, Harvard football’s offseason training under the direction of Frazier should prove to be much more impactful than just a slight edge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes, things are just meant to be.
Despite breaking bones in both his left and right feet in separate incidents within the past year, senior quarterback Joe Viviano finds himself at the helm of Harvard’s offense for the 2016 season.
Yet, needless to say, the Berwyn, Pa. resident’s path to the starting job certainly has not been a linear one.
Despite being recruited heavily out of high school, Viviano—like many freshmen—did not see game action during his inaugural year in Cambridge. One season later, the young quarterback did make it to the field but only to throw one pass and record three carries in relief. That said, it was last season that was perhaps the most trying for the 6’5” signal caller.
Heading into camp, Viviano was expected to provide a strong challenge to fellow quarterback Scott Hosch ’16. But suddenly, Viviano’s career stagnated. Before coach Tim Murphy had to choose his 2015 week one starter, Viviano suffered another setback in the preseason, falling victim to a foot injury in the waning weeks of preseason.
Given the fact that injured feet could spell trouble for a quarterback like Viviano, who relies almost as much on his legs as he does on his arm, it would not have been a surprise to see an intense battle for the starting job this fall.
However, Viviano has been a special talent in Murphy’s eyes for a long time now, and his impressive performance throughout the preseason led the coach to suspend the competition and choose Viviano to suit up against Rhode Island in the opener.
“He’s had multiple setbacks – very challenging ones that have been frustrating for us and even more frustrating for him – but there’s never been any ‘woe is me,’” Murphy said. “He’s bounced right back. He’s got a short memory, and he’s fought through it. That’s what you want from the leader of your offense.”
Along with his raw talent, Viviano’s ability to put his struggles in the rearview mirror and forge ahead made the decision a no-brainer for Murphy.
Furthermore, to Murphy and his staff, character and resiliency are two of the most important components of success on and off the field. In interviews they express the feeling that Viviano epitomizes both of those virtues.
During the recruitment process, Murphy would call Viviano each and every Sunday morning. Those phone calls only served to confirm Murphy’s favorable opinion of the standout Conestoga High School quarterback’s game.
“He was...that rare, really big quarterback that was an exceptional dual-threat athlete,” Murphy said. “He had not only the ability to do all the things you ask of your quarterback, but he also had that improvisational ability.”
Just as much as Murphy was enamored with Viviano’s physical ability and skill set, Viviano was impressed with the program Murphy had created and the legacy he had produced for himself in Cambridge.
“He was a huge influence in where I went to school,” Viviano said. “He was very open in the recruiting process. There were a lot of good things about the program.”
From the end of his high school career to the start of his first season in the driver’s seat of the Crimson offense, Viviano had not taken many snaps in game action or in practice. Despite throwing for 290 yards and three touchdowns in last Friday’s matchup against Rhode Island, projecting his performance over the rest of the Crimson’s more challenging slate is near impossible.
He is as much of an unknown commodity as is possible for a senior. Viviano, however, seems unfazed by the pressures inherent in his role.
“It feels great to finally just be out there playing,” Viviano said. “I’ve waited a long time for it. Obviously there’s been a bunch of setbacks, a bunch of adversity in between, but it was good to finally be out there playing with the guys.”
Only time will tell whether Joe Viviano will be able to lead Harvard to a fourth straight Ivy League title, but Murphy has already given a ringing endorsement of his newest field general.
“He’s going to be a good player in our league,” Murphy said. “I’m absolutely certain of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anyone who has ever played football has gotten hurt. Be it a broken bone, concussion, or just a bruise that stings a little the next day, football players repeatedly come home with aches and pains. That’s the nature of such an inherently violent game.
Personally, I can’t count the number of injuries I sustained playing football. In fifth grade, I started playing as a running back and defensive end. Eventually I settled as a safety and receiver in high school, playing three years on varsity and starting for two. So for eight years, every fall morning was tinged with a little bit of pain as I tried to recover from the previous night’s practice. I broke my finger, sprained my ankle, separated my shoulder, and had more bruises than I could count.
Most of these injuries wound up being relatively minor, though. Bones healed; scrapes went away.
But some injuries are much longer-lasting. My dad, for instance, played college football. A linebacker, he gained a reputation for physical play despite an under-six-foot stature. Late in his career, he blew out his knee, which effectively ended his playing days. Because of the severity of the injury, he no longer has cartilage in his knee, making a lot of everyday activities difficult for him. Even walking up the stairs is a struggle.
While physical injuries can be serious and have a profound impact on one’s life, the ability to heal these injuries or diminish obstacles associated with them has progressed. The brain, and our understanding of how contact affects it, is different. So, understandably, concussions are the topic of discussion throughout football.
For the past few years, there has been an increasing movement by players, coaches, and fans to promote safety in the game. As far down as high school, some teams now require players to take a standardized baseline concussion test before every season. If, during the year, they sustain what might be a concussion, they aren’t allowed to practice until they can replicate their baseline.
In March the Ivy League made headlines by announcing a policy of its own: a ban on to-the-ground tackling in practices during the season.
According to Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris, internal studies found that 49.6 percent of Ivy League concussions occurred during practice. Fifty-eight percent of those were helmet-to-helmet hits, and only four concussions occurred during non-contact practices.
“I know the rule has just been implemented this season,” senior defensive tackle Doug Webb said. “But honestly, we haven’t [tackled] since I’ve been here.”
This year a second policy takes effect. The same Ivy League study discovered that while kickoffs account for 5.8 percent of all plays, they account for 23 percent of all concussions in games. As a result, conference officials petitioned the NCAA to allow kickoffs from the 40-yard-line. The rule will apply only to in-league matchups.
“We understand there needs to be a balance between preparing our student athletes for the competition that’s going to occur but also protecting their safety during the course of the year,” Harris said. “While we don’t have all the answers when it comes to concussions, we are proud that these policies take proactive steps to enhance our student-athletes’ safety.”
The increasing concern over concussions and other head injuries is a recent phenomenon. Not until the early 2000s did scientific studies begin to train attention on concussions in the NFL in a systematic way.
“The culture was such that there was no such thing as a concussion,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It was not even in the equation.”
There is no question that Murphy, who played college football at Springfield College from 1974 to 1977, grew up during a different time with regard to concussions. The nine-time Ivy-League-winning coach knows that he suffered at least two concussions during his career—one during pickup hockey and one after a blindside hit on a kickoff return. In neither case did he skip his next practice.
“Compared to the game I played...it’s unbelievably more safe,” Murphy said. “The culture [back then] was such that if someone complained of a headache, it wasn’t the coach who got after him. It was his teammates, his peers.”
So the decision by the Ivy League to eliminate tackling is a relatively unheard of and important move in football. The lack of tackling means that players only have one day a week of full hitting, and that’s during games.
Harvard had been one of the schools at the forefront of this movement. Well before the Ivy League decided to limit hitting in practices, Murphy and his staff were running “NFL-style” practices with limited hitting and no full contact.
These measures reflect the consensus concerning the dangers of head trauma. Concussions and other brain related injuries sustained by football players are long-lasting. Pervasiveness of an injury throughout life doesn’t mean much. My ankle still cracks every time I take a step, but it doesn’t stop me from living out my life it the fullest. It’s the degeneration, the debilitating symptoms caused by CTE that make changing the game important.
“I’m one of those guys who’ve seen both sides of it,” Murphy said. “The culture is so extraordinarily different in a positive way. Why? Because everybody talks about it…. [But] you keep having to improve it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s something special about fall. Millions of kids across the country begin school, young adults leave their families for the first time to go off to college, the leaves start to turn, and—perhaps most importantly—it’s football season.
Tell me, what’s better than a little Ivy League action this Saturday? I mean, excluding the big SEC matchup of Ole Miss and Georgia. Or Wisconsin-Michigan State. Or Alabama-Kent State. Or staring at a blank wall.
Seriously, Ivy League football is boring. Take it from the guy who has to watch all 10 Harvard football games, most of which take place during actually good college football games—like the kind that people pay money to watch on TV. Not that I’m bitter.
Here’s a thought experiment: Remember what it was like to take the SAT? You spend hours staring at this blank sheet of paper, realizing you forgot to learn trig. So you decide to sit back and stare at the clock ticking. The only respite are the snack breaks. That’s what watching Ivy League football is like.
Ivy League football is kind of like the previews at movies. Actually, check that—Ivy League football is like the part before the previews where everyone is talking instead of watching the ads.
Speaking of movies, have you ever been to one by yourself? I’d never tried it until this summer, but WOW. Really good stuff. Yeah, it feels a little weird at first. But once you get in the theater and turn off your phone, it’s like you’re in another world. When you go with people, you’re always wondering what they’re thinking. God forbid you’re on a date. Then you spend the first hour trying to figure out some move you can use to put your arm around your date. And the last hour you end up fidgeting while your arms fall asleep. Another metaphor for Ivy League football, I guess.
Man, I haven’t been on a date in a while. Something about college and work and all that. Or maybe it’s the fact that all my Saturdays are spent traveling the Northeast to watch football (shoutout to my editors). Really, who knows?
But I digress. Ivy League football is back! Let’s get excited! After a shocking opening weekend in which Harvard won and Columbia lost, we finally get some league action. So sit back, crack a beer, and get ready for some sub-par college football.
HARVARD AT BROWN
So maybe I was a little harsh. Harvard football is exciting. Yeah, all my friends will be in the stands at Bryant-Denny Stadium watching the top-ranked team in the nation battle Kent State (bold prediction: Alabama wins), but like, this is cool too.
The Crimson is coming off its third straight Ivy League title, and now the team finally returns to conference action against the Bears. Harvard has a shiny, brand-new quarterback named Joe Viviano. He’s 6’5”, fast, and reminds people of Johnny Football. (If you want to learn more, see my last article. It’s a pretty fun read. I make some really interesting comparisons, and frankly it’s just really well composed. God, I’m a gifted writer.)
There’s more, too. For the past two seasons, the Crimson has had a defense that has shut out more people than male single-sex social organizations. It’s almost like watching the Steelers in the 70s. Except, again, it’s not. But close enough.
Brown is decent this year. Quarterback Kyle Moreno put up some big numbers in 2015 when Harvard beat up the Bears. The offensive line is full of large men, meaning large enough to outweigh two Gant Players.
Anyway, the Crimson has beaten Brown for the last five seasons. None of those contests was decided by a single possession. That’ll happen again this year.
Prediction: Harvard 42 - Brown 17
YALE AT CORNELL
This game. What a matchup! As per usual, Yale finished behind the Crimson last season. I wonder what that’s like, always coming in second. At some point I should talk to my older sister about that. Yikes.
And Cornell! What a season last year! After losing their first eight games, they didn’t let it get to them! They came out strong against Ivy League powerhouse Columbia and put on a show! That 3-0 win was riveting.
Prediction: Yale 24 - Cornell 7
PRINCETON AT LEHIGH
Mediocrity. That’s what defines this year’s Princeton squad. Ranked in the middle of the pack in the Ivy League after a [insert adjective here] 2015 campaign. But it is 1-0 after eking out a victory against a Lafayette team it demolished last year. So while Tiger fans should be able to rest easy knowing their team beat Lehigh 52-26 last season, think again! Also, Lehigh beat Penn last week, and those Quakers are supposed to be the Crimson’s biggest challenge this season.
Prediction: Lehigh 35 - Princeton 24
PENN AT FORDHAM
So this game is actually interesting for Harvard fans. Not that it matters. Non-conference games are pretty dumb. But Penn lost last week to Lehigh, so the Crimson’s biggest opponent this season might end up being themselves. We’ll see if Penn can beat Fordham. The Quakers are supposed to be pretty good, but what does that mean anyway?
Prediction: Penn 31 - Fordham 16
DARTMOUTH AT HOLY CROSS
Picture this: a team is down two touchdowns in the fourth quarter. After a miraculous series of drives, the team pulls out a one-point victory. One of those teams is Dartmouth.
Sounds kind of like the 2015 Harvard-Dartmouth contest, right? But that was actually the Big Green’s game last week in which they barely beat New Hampshire. Pretty interesting circle there, I guess. I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to write about anymore. I really hate thinking about the Ivy League.
Prediction: Dartmouth 30 - Holy Cross 14
COLUMBIA AT GEORGETOWN
Columbia is bad. Like, my grandmother’s desserts bad. For reference, my grandma likes to throw together basically anything she finds in her house and call it a dessert (lemon drywall was a family favorite).
Luckily for the Lions, Georgetown is also bad. Last season, the Hoyas took down mighty Columbia in a thrilling 24-16 win, but don’t sleep on the Lions this year. According to a preseason media pool, the team ranks at a whopping seventh among the Ancient Eight! I guess the only place you can go is up when you’re at the bottom.
Prediction: Columbia 16 - Georgetown 14

Are you a sophomore premed already disenamored with Chem 17? What about a freshman who already failed to finish his first CS 50 problem set even though students receive an extra 10 days this year? If so, have no fear. Though the first Add/Drop deadline has tragically passed, Harvard students still have until the Fifth Monday (October 3) to finalize their course schedules for the fall semester (and even then, why is everyone so scared of the dreaded W?). For the steep price of $10 a course (and the next 60 seconds of your life, which is all Flyby can really ask for at this point), we’ll will give you the lowdown on which courses to pick up to repair your broken semester.
Ethical Reasoning 18 - Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory
Your roommate is taking it. Your linkmate is taking it. Half your entryway is taking it. So why shouldn’t you? ER 18 is one of those Harvard staples that has left even The Atlantic asking why, exactly so many students at Harvard are so interested in studying the philosophy ancient China. If you’re dropping the ubiquity of CS 50, replace it with the ubiquity that has found its place in the hearts of so many Harvard undergraduates in search of that effortless, undeserved A.
History of Science 136 - History of Biotechnology
If you’re dropping Chem 17 because drawing those resonance structures has you stumped and you can’t master your first mechanism (note: for those brave enough to continue, it gets a lot worse), pick up this course to get the sense you’re still persevering the premed you always thought you were. Professor Sophia Roosth is an excellent lecturer, there’s no heavy science to be learned, and even if you’ve merely taken just LS1a you can watch as all your classmates struggle to wrap their head around some of the convoluted patent law discussed just as DNA wraps itself around a histone protein. Who are you kidding? This is so much better than what your science courses could ever teach you.
Economics 10a - Introduction to Economics (Micro)
Just kidding! Have you seen the price of that textbook?
Best of luck everyone. Fifth Monday will be here faster than you can say midterm season!
