After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After weeks of speculation, Elizabeth Warren released an official statement Thursday confirming that she had claimed Native American heritage to both Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania. Warren remained adamant, however, that her descent did not have an impact on job offers, as those who hired her had no knowledge of her background when they offered her the positions.
The allegations against the Democratic candidate for Massachusetts Senate were originally brought to light last month. Massachusetts Republican Party Chairman Robert A. Maginn Jr. expressed his concern in an open letter to President Drew Faust on May 6.
Maginn and other news sources perpetuated rumors that Harvard Law School used Warren’s claimed 1/32nd Cherokee ancestry as a way to boost their lagging diversity numbers in the 1990’s when Warren was first tenured.
Following Maginn’s accusation, Warren requested that her staff look into the documentation, but regardless of their findings, emphasized pride in her Cherokee background.
Although she had reported herself as “white” in the 1980s to the University of Texas, Warren first claimed Native American heritage in a national directory of law school personnel in the 1986-87 school year. According to the Boston Globe, Warren only learned that Harvard had subsequently counted her as a minority member of the faculty when she read the accusations in the Boston Herald last month.
Documents found by the Globe indicate that Harvard began reporting a female professor of Native American descent the first year Warren was on staff as a visiting professor. Harvard no longer reported such a minority on their staff during the years Warren taught at Penn, but returned to doing so upon her return to Harvard as a tenured position in Harvard’s faculty.
In Thursday’s statement, Warren said that most of her claims to Native American heritage came from stories during her youth from grandparents, aunts, uncles, and her mother. “As a kid, I never thought to ask them for documentation—what kid would?” she wrote
However, without genealogical documentation of her exact heritage, Warren does not meet the Department of Labor standards to be counted as a Native American minority. Those standards state that a person must have both ancestral documentation and affiliation with a tribe or community—neither of which Warren possesses.
Ultimately, Warren and the campaign dismissed the claims as a misuse of the public’s time during this election season. “The people of Massachusetts are concerned about their jobs, the future for their kids, and the security of retirement,” Warren wrote, “It’s past time we moved on to the important issues facing middle class families in Massachusetts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will launch a new master's degree program in Computational Science and Engineering this fall, with enrollment beginning in September 2013.
According to Professor Efthimios Kaxiras, director of the Institute for Applied Computational Science, the program will introduce students to an area of study that has expanded tremendously in recent years.
“It provides a means for students to get exposed to a whole new way of doing science,” Kaxiras said. “The old way is theory and experiment, but this whole new way based on computation has developed into its own field.”
Though Kaxiras noted that a few other schools offer computational science programs, he emphasized that Harvard's strengths across different disciplines, from natural sciences to social sciences, would enable it to create a stronger program.
“We envision this to be broader than whatever exists in the world now.” Kaxiras said.
Rosalind Reid, executive director of the IACS, noted computational science's high level of relevance to a variety of jobs.
“There are real jobs out there and real needs for computational science and engineering,” Reid said.
Reid also noted the program's emphasis on real-world applications. The program was developed both by Harvard faculty members and by members of industry who use computational science. The two groups collaborated to compile a list of eight goals that each student should be able to meet by the end of the program.
“These were shaped through conversation with people in industry and national labs and with faculty members,” Reid said. “They're very practical.”
In addition, the program will feature a lecture series by prominent individuals who have used computational science.
“The purpose is to show the students that this type of approach in CSE can yield wonderful things,” Kaxiras said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite not having the opportunity to play during her freshman year due to NCAA eligibility rules, Harvard women's basketball’s Temi Fagbenle may soon get to compete on an even bigger stage—the 2012 London Olympics.
Fagbenle, a rising sophomore, has officially made it through the first two rounds of eliminations for Great Britain’s national team, placing her in a field of now only 14 players. Only two more players will be cut before the final roster is released on June 22.
Great Britain’s head coach, Tom Maher, spoke positively of Fagbenle to the media this week, calling her a “special" talent and a “real fillip.”
If these next three weeks play out similarly to what has transpired thus far in training camp, it looks like Fagbenle will be setting aside her Crimson jersey and donning Great Britain’s blue and white uniform when Olympics basketball begin on July 28.

The Administration has reached no final decision concerning the establishment of uniform menus throughout the House system, L. Gard Wiggins, administrative vice president, has revealed.
At present, five of the Houses serve identical meals. The University wants to extend the common menu system to the independent Houses in an attempt to cut costs. Masters of the Houses not associated with the Central Kitchen strongly oppose the new plan.
