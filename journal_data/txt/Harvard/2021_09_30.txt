After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For over 25 years, my family’s primary source of income has been a gas station. Although I am biased, I would staunchly defend that it is completely unique. Rather than the typical spinning hot dogs, sticky floors, and dimly lit corners, our gas station is much more like a mom-and-pop store. In my small, rural hometown, many people rely on us for their groceries, local newspaper, and morning coffee.
Throughout high school, I occasionally worked as a cashier. As a stereotypically aloof teenager, I had difficulty seeing the value of unfolding sweaty dollar bills and emptying the trash cans by the gas pumps. Now, thinking back on the late Friday nights when the high school football fans would rush in for a halftime snack and the hurried weekday mornings when friends would bump into each other on the way to work, I understand that in our community, the store brings people together. My grandfather, the owner and manager, has always understood that value. Whenever he can, he uses the store to bring together and give back to the community that supports us.
The idea that our store, an unassuming fixture of a tiny town, contributed to the perpetuation of the disastrous fossil fuel industry never occurred to me until Harvard announced its divestment from fossil fuels. While my peers ecstatically high-fived and celebrated, I hesitated because the decline of the fossil fuel industry could mean the end of my family’s way of life.
Of course, my family is not the only cog in the machine of the fossil fuel industry; the livelihoods of many other people are also currently tied to fossil fuels. As other companies and institutions hopefully follow Harvard’s lead and the fossil fuel industry is pressured, the lives of these individuals and my family will be forced to change.
To be clear, this change is absolutely necessary. Climate change is an immediate threat that requires immediate action, but as we pursue action, it is also our responsibility to consider how that action will affect the people within the lower ranks of the fossil fuel industry.
Advocating for the end of an industry could lead to job loss and financial hardship, but it also creates a vacuum that can and should be filled by renewable resources. Filling this gap and helping those reliant on the fossil fuel sector transition requires both divestment and reinvestment. The liquidated funds from Harvard’s divestment should be reinvested to support the growth of the renewable resource industry.
This proactive approach boasts clear financial and reputational benefits for Harvard.
Reinvestment is a logical continuation of the financial argument in favor of divestment. If it is prudent to withdraw investments from a dying industry, it makes perfect sense to redirect these investments to a growing industry. Of course, being involved with an industry on the rise has obvious advantages in terms of endowment return.
As one of the world’s leading academic institutions, Harvard should strive not to meet expectations but exceed them. This means actively working for positive change. Demonstrating a strong commitment to creative action against climate change can bolster Harvard’s reputation as innovative and globally-minded.
Strengthening the renewable resource industry is key to a smooth energy transition. If the industry is seen as stronger, it will be much easier for individuals and families, like mine, to become financially independent from fossil fuels and possibly adapt to rely upon renewable resources instead. Most importantly, however, investing in renewable resources is a long-term investment in a sustainable future.
Harvard’s divestment presents the perfect opportunity for this kind of metaphorical and monetary investment, which will almost immediately pay dividends.
I have made peace with the fact that change will inevitably transform my family’s gas station. For me, my family, and others involved in the fossil fuel industry, divestment is personal, but it is not bad. Rather than shying away from what might be seen as a threat, we should share our perspectives, allowing for a more thoughtful and effective transition away from fossil fuels that we and future generations will benefit from.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I arrived on Harvard’s campus as a first-year last fall, I felt a strong culture shock as I transitioned from my almost all-white conservative suburb to Cambridge’s predominantly white liberal environment.
I was used to being confronted with Trump signs on the walk home from the bus stop, but instead, I ran into Black Lives Matter signs on what felt like every street corner and shop. Students at Harvard included BLM slogans and iconography in their Undergraduate Council campaigns, whereas at my high school students actively tried to dodge questions of race; they claimed that it was a “racism-free” environment when a question was raised as to why the student government candidates were disproportionately white.
Suddenly, the combination of a far more liberal environment and the political awakening of the summer of 2020 meant that way more white people were displaying and affirming their anti-racism than I had ever expected to see.
A small part of me wanted to believe that these changes ran deeper than just iconography and social media posts. Yet, as I began to engage in discussions regarding issues of race in the classroom with non-Black Harvard students and staff, the hollowness of students’ purported anti-racism could not be ignored. Conversations regarding social justice in Harvard classrooms were shallow, starved of any critical self-reflection; instead, it was often reiterated that the Republican Party, Trump supporters, the criminal justice system, conservatives, and/or rural white voters were deeply racist.
Even when class discussions dealt with how we the students see race and race relations today, my white and non-Black peers rarely offered insight into their own experiences and past. They just continued to point to the “bad racists.” The only time they showed even the slightest bit of vulnerability is when they admitted that they had not known or not realized something — pleading ignorance. But even then, they often did not stop to ask why they were ignorant in the first place when Black people have been speaking up and begging to be listened to for decades.
My peers operate with the default assumption that they are unproblematic. I have come to realize that the assumption for many of them is that only outwardly hostile or “microaggressive” people are racist. To be a racist is the most horrible thing in the world and they are not horrible people, so they must not be a part of the problem. Thus, they feel they have no need to critically self-reflect. Self-reflection would require a degree of vulnerability that our current culture actively tries to suppress.
Anti-vulnerability culture is one in which everyone is expected to only present their best selves to be as appealing to as large a group of people as possible. Nobody feels comfortable being vulnerable by acknowledging or confronting the aspects of themselves that risk judgment from others.
The reality is this: A problem cannot be solved unless it is acknowledged. How can we pursue racial equity when we can’t acknowledge the full extent of racism in our culture or even confront the bigoted beliefs in our own minds? We must unlearn the idea that our vulnerabilities — things about ourselves that we are ashamed of or open us up to judgment from others — should be denied, hidden, or suppressed, rather than acknowledged, embraced, or confronted.
Anti-vulnerability, while a crucial aspect of white fragility, is not just an individual issue; it is a culture that incentivizes us to maintain any biases we might have instead of rooting them out. We encourage one another to suppress our vulnerabilities, which only serves to inhibit forward progress.
Of course, even in the absence of anti-vulnerability culture, opening up still feels extremely difficult. I know that it’s a struggle for me and that I often fail to be as vulnerable as I should be. I am still unlearning the ingrained ideas of patriarchy, classism, ableism, fatphobia, and internalized racism. I still catch myself thinking a problematic thought, using non-inclusive language, or failing to live up to my values in other ways. Even as I wrote this article I caught myself using the term “freshman” instead of the more gender-inclusive “first-year.”
I’m learning that unlearning takes serious work. It can also be difficult to show up to do this work when you’re struggling to keep up with a busy Harvard schedule or maintain your mental health. I certainly haven’t fully unlearned anything. I’m writing as someone who is also trying to figure this stuff out, and I’m disappointed that many other people seem to think they already have or don’t need to. How can you go to other people and say “you need to unlearn your racist ideas,” without acknowledging that you yourself still have unlearning left to do?
And so if one truly wants to be an ally, they will have to struggle. Being an ally should mean fighting systems of oppression in all of its forms — in your own mind, with your family and friends, in your church, community, and social clubs, and in the government and corporations. Doing so would inevitably result in consequences — such as lost friends, estranged family members, all the way to state violence — but these are just a taste of the consequences that marginalized people endure simply to survive.
Until students — especially non-Black students — unlearn their affinity towards anti-vulnerability and value the liberation of oppressed peoples enough to do real work, the BLM signs will remain empty platitudes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last summer, George Floyd’s murder at the hands of police alongside too many other slain Americans ignited an overdue international reconsideration of modern policing. Though any bipartisan attempt at police reform seems to have puttered out on Capitol Hill, an impressive effort to rethink when police are really needed — and what of their stacked caseloads could be better handled by alternative responders — has taken root closer to home at the Harvard Kennedy School.
In a refreshing new initiative, HKS’s Government Performance Lab has partnered with five different cities to help implement alternative responses to non-violent 911 calls. Instead of deploying cops in response to non-violent crises, the goal is to connect residents with unarmed emergency responders skilled in areas such as mental health services and substance use treatment when appropriate. It's a welcome admission of the fact that given the heap of issues we task police with addressing (drug abuse, traffic accidents, child endangerment, embezzlement, emergency medical assistance …), many 911 calls might be better resolved by a social worker rather than a gun.
Harvard’s role in the initiative will be that of a well-resourced collaborator: providing cities with technical assistance, creating training curricula for response teams, designing 911 call decision trees, procuring services, and helping to engage the local community. The cities participating in the program — Durham, N.C., Harris County, Texas, Long Beach, Calif., Philadelphia, Pa., and Phoenix, Ariz — were selected from an applicant pool of 60 on the basis of factors like progress towards implementing alternative 911 responses and potential for impact. Some already have alternative 911 response programs in place; others are looking to get theirs off the ground.
We are thrilled to see Harvard affiliates leveraging their resources and influence to pursue meaningful change at the local level. As prone to aspiring towards leadership as us Harvard students are, the Government Performance Lab’s ethos of creating change through assisting local actors is a great reminder that sometimes, the best thing we can do is lend a hand.
The lab’s efforts hit on two monumental public safety issues. One: that police encounters with Black Americans too often escalate needlessly and culminate in death, and at three times the rate of white people. And two: that our country is in the grips of a devastating mental health crisis — one which disproportionately affects our youth and most vulnerable, and which has only gotten worse amid the national precarity and economic inequity magnified by the global pandemic. Too often, the mentally ill end up thrust into the hands of the criminal justice system, in lieu of a robust social safety net, where their outcomes are often grim. With these crises in the air, the lab’s efforts to minimize police contact where it makes sense to is all the better received.
At a broader level, this project also provides an admirable model for how universities can translate their lofty rhetoric on equity and inclusion into action. We hope to see this community-based model used more often across the University, rightfully building on the work of community activists instead of reinventing the wheel.
We’ve previously argued that the Harvard University Police Department uses its private designation to shield itself from scrutiny while functioning, in practice, like any public police force (discrimination included). Campus police forces are an unfortunate and relatively new invention. And, since 95 percent of HUPD’s caseload deals with property crimes, we believe ours could be replaced by a team of unarmed Securitas guards. In light of the unlikelihood of this occurring, we urge Harvard initiatives studying policing to turn their gaze inwards, and to suggest what alternative 911 responses could look like on our campus, where Black homeless men have been subject to excessive police violence for the sin of trespassing in the Smith Campus Center. A 911 call decision tree based in our own campus ecosystem would be excellent.
We applaud HKS for this enterprising initiative, and hope it can help create successful blueprints for unarmed, alternative 911 response teams nationwide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An organization that advocates for first-generation, low-income students led by Harvard Kennedy School student Viet A. Nguyen launched a campaign to boycott alumni donations until universities to stop considering applicants’ legacy status as a factor in the college admissions process.
First envisioned by the organization, EdMobilizer, as an annual conference to unite and empower first-generation and low-income students, the #LeaveYourLegacy campaign has taken on an additional mission under Nguyen’s leadership: to end legacy preference in admissions.
“How do we use our voice within this ivory tower to push for change?” said Nguyen, a student from a low-income background who attended Brown and is now completing a joint degree at Stanford Business School and the Kennedy School.
“You only hear from folks who are very big donors who are very excited to pass on the legacy preferences, even though I’m willing to bet that the majority of folks would be fine getting rid of it,” Nguyen said. “This campaign was really to mobilize that silent majority — to voice their thoughts to the boards who have the power to make this decision.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
Legacy preference has long been a standard practice for admissions at elite institutions.
In fact, a recent Crimson survey found that 15.5 percent of the College’s Class of 2025 reported legacy status, defined as having one or more parents who attended the College.
Gabriel Reyes — a FGLI doctoral student at Stanford and EdMobilizer advisory board member — said admitting students based on legacy status is “insidious.”
“It always means that first-gen applicants are at a disadvantage,” Reyes said. “To know that these schools feel like they are at the mercy of a very small percentage of people that have wealth, for lack of a better word, is pathetic.”
“It feels like a constant reminder that as a first-gen, I often have to work harder than some of my most privileged peers,” he added. “Even if I work twice as hard, I still will have barriers that I just can’t overcome because of practices like this, which aim to further advantage people who already have a leg-up in the process.”
Evan J. Mandery ’89, a law professor at John Jay College who authored a 2014 op-ed in The Crimson calling for an end to legacy preferences, said universities maintain consideration of legacy status to “stimulate fundraising” from alumni donations — a practice EdMobilizer’s boycott directly targets.
“There is no evidence whatsoever of any link between legacy preference and giving,” Mandery said. “There have been several studies that have shown that there is no correlation, and some schools which have moved away from legacy preference show no drop in giving – MIT is a notable example.”
Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Julie A. Reuben said for a more representative study body, universities should institute other policies rather than removing legacy preferences alone.
“You could get rid of legacy and still admit students from the very top of the economic structure, from only the very most restrictive suburbs or expensive private schools – you can still have that be your student profile without having legacy,” Reuben said. “It’s not the legacy itself that will change the structure of the classes.”
Nguyen acknowledged the difficulty of eliminating a long-standing policy.
“We’re also not naive – this practice has been around for centuries. And so what we’re trying to do is make as much noise as possible, do what we can within our power to not stay silent,” Nguyen said. “The more that we can speak out, the more that we can keep this momentum going.”
“At the end of the day, we care more about justice and equity than about passing on this privilege to our children,” Nguyen added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said safely maintaining in-person instruction and dining are the College’s top priorities this semester in a Wednesday interview.
Khurana said safeguarding the “health of our community” has informed the College’s planning since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
“That’s been our guiding principle since all of this began 18 months ago,” he said. “After that is to keep in-person education, so ensuring in-person instruction is the highest priority. Second is the good functioning of our residential system, and in particular, the importance of dining in our residential system.”
Khurana said the dining hall is the “social heartbeat” of the residential system. He added that the College’s third priority is supporting undergraduate co-curricular activities.
During the previous academic year, as the College held classes on Zoom, Harvard imposed strict restrictions on those students remaining on campus, such as limiting the number of students living on campus, closing dining halls, and forbidding indoor gatherings.
In welcoming all undergraduates back to campus this semester, the College resumed full operations, including in-person instruction, full-capacity housing, and buffet dining.
But just days after the start of the fall semester, despite a campus-wide vaccine mandate, a rise in coronavirus cases on campus led Harvard to increase the frequency of coronavirus testing for undergraduates from once per week to three times per week.
During Wednesday’s interview, Khurana urged students to stay home if they feel ill and to report any symptoms they experience through Crimson Clear, the University’s symptom screening tool.
“If you’re not feeling well, don’t go to class. We have very clear established guidelines for that,” he said. “If somebody does test positive for Covid — it must be very distressing and stressful — and the first thing I would say: ‘Don’t blame yourself. Getting sick is nobody’s fault.’”
Khurana assured students that faculty will accommodate those who test positive for Covid-19 and must enter isolation, or those who miss class for other health reasons. He noted that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has provided instructors with guidelines to prevent students in those situations from falling behind academically. To support isolating students, faculty can assign alternative coursework and record classes.
“If you feel like as a student who happens to be in isolation that you’re not getting the response you need from faculty, the resident deans can get involved,” Khurana said. “If that’s still challenging, our Dean of Undergraduate Education — please let her know — Dean [Amanda J.] Claybaugh.”
Khurana also addressed the stress students may be feeling back on campus this fall.
“It’s natural to feel anxiety and stress at this moment,” he said. “I think all of us feel like the transitions are hard, especially when you get changing guidelines.”
Khurana commended students’ adherence to Covid-19 protocols during the first month of the semester.
“I want to express my gratitude to our student community, knowing that we have the largest number of Harvard undergraduates in the history of Harvard here,” he said. “We are all tightly packed in different kinds of spaces, and yet people are finding ways of making sure we’re masking.”
“I’m grateful for the human connection that we’ve been able to restore that makes getting through those difficult times easier,” Khurana added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said the return to in-person instruction has been “energizing” as he outlined updates regarding the Sciences Division’s ongoing endeavors in a Tuesday interview with The Crimson.
“The energy on campus is just palpable. And it’s great to have the students back. It’s great to be back to being an intellectual community of scholars and learners,” Stubbs said.
He described the return to Harvard laboratories as a “staged process,” explaining that researchers have already been back in laboratories for a long time, faculty and staff are starting to settle in, and students will be coming back in large numbers.
“That’s still something that we’re feeling our way through,” Stubbs said. “Harvard is no different than other parts of the economy and the world, of trying to understand: what combination of working remotely, working in person; how do we allocate offices, how do we share spaces.”
Stubbs said that although there is a “diversity of apprehension” within the division about being in-person amid the ongoing pandemic, the College’s high vaccination rate is a “reassuring element.”
Stubbs also pointed to the absence of Covid-19 transmission cases in classroom settings as a mark of success.
“Our workplace, the research laboratories, and our classrooms where we encounter one another in a classroom setting, are not places where Covid transmission has happened,” Stubbs said.
“I think the instances that we have on campus of colleagues falling ill are infections that are acquired in other ways,” he added. “I think we need to be cognizant of that, but as far as I know we’ve established a supportive and safe learning and research environment on campus.”
Later in the interview, Stubbs discussed the division’s upcoming major intellectual initiatives, including the newly launched Ph.D. Program in the quantum science and engineering department.
According to Stubbs, construction at 60 Oxford Street — where the program is set to be housed — is “moving forward really nicely,” and the division is continuing to recruit faculty for the program.
Stubbs also commented on the two oversight committees that Harvard formed in 2019 to ensure that the FAS was not susceptible to research integrity issues such as academic espionage.
“Our stance at Harvard is that we don’t do any classified research on this campus at all. There are no secrets here for people to steal, and we’re as keen as ever to engage in the free flow of people, ideas, and scholars,” Stubbs said.
Lastly, Stubbs addressed current pending legislation that would increase federal science research funding. He said he will remain “guardedly optimistic” about the priority the Biden administration seems to place on science and technology.
Looking toward the future, Stubbs said he is interested to see how the division will continue to evolve in the face of an “endemic pathogen.”
“What’s it going to look like next fall? What's it going to look like the fall after that? What’s the long-term end stage here, as we accommodate what will end up being an endemic pathogen?” Stubbs said. “I think that that chapter of this book has yet to be written.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — A group of Harvard-affiliated doctors protested outside the home of Moderna’s CEO Wednesday, calling on the Cambridge-based biotech company to expand global access to its Covid-19 vaccine.
Standing in front of a towering pile of artificial bones meant to symbolize the coronavirus’s ever-growing death toll, four Harvard Medical School faculty members said the company and its top executive, Stéphane Bancel, have a responsibility to increase supply of the vaccine outside of wealthy nations.
“We want to make the vaccines globally available to people who want it,” Salmaan A. Keshavjee, an HMS professor who spoke at the rally, said in an interview Wednesday. “If we aren’t able to do that, we’re not going to be able to stop the spread of new variants, and we’re not going to be able to come out of this whole Covid pandemic.”
The group of rally attendees, which included advocates and public health experts sporting white lab coats outside of Bancel’s Beacon Hill home, called on Moderna to increase vaccine production, cooperate and share technology with other manufacturers, and commit to lower pricing for low- and middle-income countries.
Moderna did not respond to a request for comment. The firm, founded in 2010, said last fall that it would not enforce patents related to its Covid-19 vaccine.
But the rally comes amid growing pressure on U.S. pharmaceutical companies to do more to prevent the spread of the disease worldwide, including by sharing vaccination formulas with other manufacturers.
The Moderna vaccine is being used in 75 countries around the world, according to a New York Times dashboard, including the U.S. and much of Europe. Many low-income nations — including much of central Africa, where Moderna shots are sparsely available — have struggled to vaccinate their populations.
“This is continuing because men like Stéphane Bancel have decided to exploit the pandemic for profit,” KJ Seung, an HMS assistant professor, said at the rally Wednesday. “By keeping the recipe secret, Bancel and Moderna prevent other manufacturers from making the vaccine. That allows Bancel and Moderna to make the most money by selling a restricted supply to rich countries at very, very high prices.”
The rally also comes on the heels of a Covid-19 summit President Joe Biden held last week, during which he set a goal to vaccinate 70 percent of the world population within the next year and pledged to donate an additional 500 million vaccine doses to developing nations.
The summit, Seung said, “was all platitudes, pageantry, no hard plans.”
Rallygoers called on Biden to compel Moderna to share its vaccine technology and commit to a more aggressive vaccine donation program.
A similar rally was held outside White House Chief of Staff Ronald A. Klain’s home in Chevy Chase, Md., Wednesday.
Rebecca M. Zash, an assistant professor at HMS who has worked as a researcher and advocate to fight the HIV pandemic, said the situation is “déjà vu to what HIV was like 20 years ago.”
“It’s wrong, it’s morally reprehensible, and it’s personal to me,” she said. “It’s my friends and my colleagues in Botswana who are dying of Covid because of where they were born and their lack of access to vaccines.”

Though students were excited to return to Harvard’s dorms this fall, upon their arrival some found unwelcome guests, including insects and mushrooms, and crumbling infrastructure in their rooms.
Five undergraduates told The Crimson that they encountered cockroaches, bedbugs, moths, mushrooms, or decrepit walls and ceilings in their rooms during their first weeks back on campus after many dorms sat empty for 18 months.
Eliot House resident Yana O. Hubyak ’24 said that she and her roommates discovered six cockroaches throughout their suite, including “three alive ones and three dead ones.”
“I’ll be honest, considering how much money Eliot has, I felt like it was a little outrageous that we had this many cockroaches,” Hubyak said. “We were told to just get roach traps.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that building managers strive to resolve maintenance issues “as quickly as possible.”
Dane also wrote that the College’s focus on protecting students’ health during the pandemic has lengthened its response time to routine dorm complaints.
“Given the unprecedented logistical challenges associated with implementing new COVID safety measures while returning to a full campus occupancy, response time to some maintenance requests may be longer, particularly at the start of the semester,” Dane wrote. “We ask students for both patience and understanding as building managers work to resolve these issues.”
Desiree A. Rickett ’24, who lives in Mather’s low-rise building, said she and her roommates discovered mushrooms growing in their carpeted common room at the start of the semester.
Rickett said she observed a large puddle on the carpet when she moved into the suite. Subsequently, in the same spot of the carpet, her suitemates noticed mushrooms growing, which first appeared white and soon darkened.
Rickett said Mather’s building manager addressed the issue by “cutting a hole in the wall, and putting a bucket there, and then putting a fan there.”
Two weeks later, the mushrooms returned.
Eventually, Harvard maintenance staff patched up the hole in the wall, which stopped the mushrooms from growing; however, the water stain remains.
“I was just worried about them multiplying at a rapid speed,” Rickett said. “I’ve heard there’s health concerns when you have mushrooms in your suite.”
West of the mushrooms, in Kirkland House, Crystal Wang ’23 said her suite was afflicted with a moth infestation.
“There were maybe, at one time, twenty moths in one night,” Wang said. “Every time my roommates were inside we were killing moths here and there, while we’re trying to do our work.”
Wang and her roommates successfully resolved their moth problem by limiting sources of light, thoroughly cleaning their suite, and buying pheromone traps.
Still, Wang said she no longer feels comfortable in her room.
“I used to love studying in the common room,” Wang said. “But with the moth issue, all my roommates are never there, and every time I go back to my room it’s just to sleep.”
Crumbling infrastructure has also beset some students’ rooms.
Markus I. Anzaldua-Campos ’24, a Kirkland resident and a Crimson Editorial editor, said there is a big hole in his closet wall where one can see “a lot of piping.”
“I just went ahead and covered it with one of my cardboard boxes,” Anzaldua-Campos said, adding that it “hasn’t been much of a bother.”
Ruben A. Fonseca Castro ’24, who lives in Fairfax Hall, said rainstorm-induced water damage caused his shower ceiling to break in August.
“A massive chunk of the ceiling was in the bathtub,” he said.
Fonseca Castro said he and his roommate reported the problem, but help did not arrive until four days later.
“We showered with the hole over our heads. It was scary, because you don’t know if it’s done falling,” he said. “You have no clue if more stuff is going to come down.”

“I might be the first one in history to do that,” senior Owen Holt told assorted media after an MLB pre-draft workout at Minute Maid Park in Houston on July 1. He was referring to his unorthodox journey to professional baseball, which took him on a winding path from Lamar High School in his native Houston to two years of football with Harvard before he ended up dual-enrolled at Harvard and Alvin Community College in Alvin, Texas, playing baseball for the Dolphins and taking a full schedule of classes at both schools.
During his senior season in 2017, Holt served as the captain of Lamar, a school with a rich history of producing professional baseball players, including Los Angeles Angels superstar third baseman Anthony Rendon. The team went on to finish that season ranked fourth nationally by MaxPreps, and Holt was named to the all-district first team in both his junior and senior seasons. He also starred as the quarterback and team captain for the football team his senior year.
After matriculating at Harvard, he decided to focus on football, spending two years playing quarterback for coach Tim Murphy’s program. While in spring practices, Holt recalled watching baseball practices on the nearby training field and paying particular attention to the pitchers. He only saw action in one football game for the Crimson, against Yale in 2018 at Fenway Park, and ultimately made the transition to baseball prior to the start of the 2020 season. Despite recording no stats in his collegiate football career, he expressed gratitude for the lessons in preparation that playing football had taught him.
“Constant improvement is the key. [In football], every single week, you just have one game and one opponent. And so every week, the game plan’s a little different. You want to stick to your strengths, but hey, what are the other team's weaknesses?” he said. “And so each day had a goal. Being a starting pitcher in college is pretty similar too, so you'll get a start on Saturday or Friday. And so it's [batting practice] Monday, this is what we're doing Tuesday, it was all regimented and stacking good days.”
Still, the right-hander was a relatively raw pitching prospect when he joined the team. Despite his relative inexperience, he started Harvard’s second game of the 2020 season, on the road against the University of Alabama. The Crimson Tide entered the game with a 10-0 record, and by the time the Southeastern Conference (SEC) suspended its season, it had amassed a 16-1 record, matching Florida and Ole Miss atop the conference. Holt recalled his nerves facing such a formidable opponent in his first collegiate appearance, but the mental fortitude he had built up throughout his sports career allowed him to thrive.
“But you know, there were a ton of people there. I remember [it] being pregame and I just finished warming up in the bullpen,” he said. “And I'm sitting in the dugout, and my heart [was] just beating and I'm like, 'Oh man, I'm gonna have a heart attack here.' So I was like, just focus on breathing. And let's go out there and see what happens. So it was just really fun, you know.”
Although Alabama ultimately emerged victorious, 10-5, Holt’s talent shone. He pitched five scoreless innings and struck out three Crimson Tide batters on an efficient 75 pitches, allowing just three walks and four hits. Although his next start, on March 7 against Ohio State, did not go so smoothly — he yielded 7 runs in three innings against the Buckeyes — he took a lot of positives out of his brief Harvard career.
Despite being saddled with the loss against Ohio State after his brilliant debut, Holt exhibited many improvements throughout the abbreviated season. Harvard’s baseball program relies largely on the help of Trackman and Rapsodo technologies, which allow its pitchers to understand the spin rates on all of their pitches. Head coach Bill Decker and assistant coach Brady Kirkpatrick emphasized placing certain pitches in certain areas of the strike zone to set batters up in certain ways. Holt credited both the analytical approach and his teammates for helping him fulfill some of his immense potential.
“Coach Kirkpatrick does a great job, but the pitchers up there and Coach Decker are great,” Holt said. “And, you know, not to mention the other guys. That's another thing. You know, you're gonna learn a lot from the coaches, but you're going to learn even more from your teammates, about life, and just about pitching, like, how do you grip your slider, that sort of thing. So I learned a ton from those guys.”
However, after his shortened season, he had amassed just eight college innings at the age of 21. Despite his high school accomplishments, raw talent, and his strong debut against Alabama, Holt was hardly on the MLB radar. Throughout the fall semester, he stayed at home and trained in Houston, while still enrolled in classes. As the semester progressed, however, he realized that if he were to get on the mound the next season, it would not be for Harvard.
The only solution in which he would be able to play baseball without sacrificing his Harvard education was to enroll in junior college. Because junior colleges are not part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bracket, he was eligible to compete immediately for a community college without having to sit out a season, which he would have had to do had he transferred to another four-year school.
Thus, after consulting with his dean and NCAA eligibility representative at Harvard, as well as Decker, he committed to play for Alvin Community College in Alvin, Texas, about a 45-minute drive away from his house in central Houston. The Dolphins, managed by coach Jason Schreiber, were coming off a 32-24 (.571) season in 2019.
Throughout the season, Holt had to manage an intense workload. He lived at home, so he had to commute every day for classes and baseball practice, in addition to taking a full load of classes at both Alvin and Harvard. The economics concentrator took three classes at Harvard in addition to the minimum four required to play for the Dolphins. In order to manage his workload, Holt sometimes had to make sacrifices. Often, while his teammates would watch movies together after practice, he would drive home to study for an economics test, hoping to avoid worrying about his academics on game day.
“You know, there were a lot of times where it was pretty overwhelming,” he said. “And on nights before games, I'd be knocking out part of an essay or, like, on these long bus trips, I'd have my hotspot on and do a little work on the side, and all the guys would be like, ‘Oh, the Harvard guy.’ So I definitely had to be on top of it.”
Throughout the season, Holt gained valuable collegiate baseball experience and flashed some of his lofty potential. He appeared in 14 games, including 12 starts, finishing third on the team with 57 innings pitched. He exhibited his power in those innings, fanning 65 batters at a rate of 10.26 strikeouts per nine innings, good for second among the Dolphins’ regular starters. Schreiber’s eye-test based approach complemented Decker’s data-driven coaching style and allowed him to add secondary pitches to his repertoire.
“When I first saw Owen, he already had a big fastball: 92-95 [miles per hour]. I think the biggest improvement was with his secondary pitches. He added a slider that made it a lot easier to get outs,” explained Schreiber in an email to The Crimson.
Despite his 5.68 ERA, he consistently made positive contributions, earning a 7-3 win-loss record. Holt’s success on the mound helped the Dolphins amass a winning record, finishing the season 29-23 (.558). Schreiber noted that his work ethic and positive attitude rubbed off on the team and impacted its success.
“Owen brought a special leadership quality; the other players followed his lead,” he wrote. “I saw his work ethic carry over to the other players on the team. His love for life is special. My favorite moment was before every game I would ask him how he was feeling warming up in the bullpen, [and] he would always say, ‘I feel dangerous today, coach.’”
Holt must have felt dangerous in the first game of his Alvin career, against McLennan Community College, when he pitched four innings, giving up two runs, striking out six batters, walking none, and earning the win. Although McLennan, the fourth-ranked junior college team in the country at the time, would go on to win the NJCAA (National Junior College Athletic Association) National Championship that season, Holt’s Dolphins emerged with an 11-6 victory.
“They were ranked number four in the country at that time,” Holt recalled. “And I ended up giving up a two-run homer in the fourth inning. But I threw three scoreless before that, and we ended up winning that game, it was like 11 to six. And that was my first ‘welcome to junior college’ game and that was definitely pretty fun.”
After the season, he initially committed to continue his career at Texas Chrisitan University. However, he left his options open as he debated the merits of playing an extra year of college baseball. Ultimately, he decided that, as he was already 22 years old, relatively old for MLB draftees, it would be more beneficial to declare for the draft and spend the next year in a minor league system instead.
After declaring, he joined the MLB Draft League, jointly run by Major League Baseball and Prep Baseball Report, a wide-ranging amateur baseball database. Together with other draft-eligible prospects from all around the country, he spent much of the late spring and early summer in Williamsport, Pa., playing for the MLB Draft League’s Crosscutters. Despite the Crosscutters’ lack of success, finishing fifth of six teams with a 25-32-3 (.433) record, he described it as a valuable experience in his preparation for the majors.
“I just love the baseball guys. I have so much fun with them,” he said. “And speaking of people, baseball does a great job … of bringing people together from literally all over the world. I guess these were all the draft-eligible guys, but they were from all over the place. And so that was just really fun. It was a lot of baseball but the coaching staff up there and the guys made it really fun and all the guys were kind of working towards the same goal. So that was pretty neat.”
In addition to the MLB Draft League, Holt flew back to Houston for local workouts with all 30 MLB teams. He specifically referenced a particularly special workout with the Houston Astros, in which he got to throw in Minute Maid Park, the 2017 World Series champions’ stadium.
“That was pretty cool,” said Holt with a laugh. “They had us warming up in the bullpen. And I thought about sprinting from the bullpen to the mound just because I was so excited. But I decided to hold back on that.”
As he continued to gain pitching experience and participate in showcases, MLB teams eventually started to take notice. In traditional draft scouting, teams will approach players with a projection for what round they might be drafted in and how much money they might make. During the 20-round draft, teams tend to deliberate more over their early-round selections than the players they target with later picks. On draft day, surrounded by family and friends, Holt was pretty confident that he was going to be selected.
His hard work paid off when the Cincinnati Reds decided to pick him with their 16th round pick, 480th overall. Holt became the fourth Crosscutter to be drafted, including the second by the Reds. When he heard his name called, he was filled with relief and elation, and his unorthodox journey to professional baseball was complete.
Ultimately, despite being drafted, he aims to complete his degree and is hopeful that, having succeeded with his intense schedule in the spring, he will be able to enroll in his last semester of coursework while simultaneously chasing his baseball dreams. For now, he hopes to “keep stacking good days” and make his way through the Reds’ system.
To make the major leagues, though, he will need to put in a lot more work. He spent the summer at the Reds’ spring training facility in Arizona, spending his afternoons in meetings, workouts, and throwing bullpen sessions. He currently pitches for the Arizona League Reds, participating in games against other rookies at various spring training complexes throughout the state. In four games, including one start, he currently sports a 7.71 ERA while striking out 11 batters in seven total innings. In those games, he has compiled a 2-1 win-loss record.
“I can hit an inside fastball right there. But can [I] do it consistently? Can [I] throw a breaking ball first strike on a 2-0 count? And then, on a 1-2 count, can [I] throw the same pitch, but in the dirt, and get them chasing? And can [I] do that consistently? And can [I] match [my] same energy levels every single day? I think that's what separates the guys that really make it to the big leagues and the guys that don't,” he explained.
As he continues his journey to the Show, he knows that he will always have at least one valuable supporter in his corner: Schreiber.
The coach wrote, “I was very excited to hear he was drafted by the Reds; I know how hard he worked for this moment. There is no doubt Owen will thrive in professional baseball.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard fell by a score of 3-1 to No. 6 New Hampshire in a closely contested match on Tuesday night in Durham, N.H. In its final game before Ivy League play, the Crimson proved that it could match up with one of the best teams in the country.
Despite the game finishing with a two-goal margin, Harvard (3-3-1, 0-0 Ivy League) stayed within touching distance of No. 6 New Hampshire (10-0-0, 2-0-0 America East) all night and could have taken the game to overtime had things gone the Crimson’s way.
“Though it hurts that we lost the game, it's important that we absorb as much information as we can from that experience to improve,” said first-year defender Ludovico Rollo of the match. “UNH forced us to make mistakes in that game that we can learn to avoid in future games.”
Rollo was one of three players to feature for the full 90 minutes for the Crimson, along with fellow first-year center back Jan Riecke and junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson. Harvard made extensive use of its bench on the night, with 19 players appearing for the Crimson, including first-year midfielder Max Goeggel, who made his career debut.
The game got off to an eventful start, with the Wildcats pulling out ahead with a well-worked goal in only the eighth minute, showing why it is one of the best teams in the country this year. Harvard was not deterred though, as it equalized less than five minutes later in the thirteenth minute after senior midfielder Cornelius Bencsik had a shot blocked before firing in the rebound.
The goal was Bencsik’s second in his last two games, and he was again assisted by first-year forward Alessandro Arlotti, who picked up his third assist of the season. New Hampshire restored its lead soon after the equalizer, regaining its one-goal advantage in the 21st minute after the Crimson failed to clear a ball in the air and was cut open by the ensuing cross.
Harvard continued to create chances and came within inches of equalizing in the 30th minute after sophomore forward Ale Gutierrez whipped in a dangerous cross to the feet of junior forward Martin Vician, but the Bratislava, Slovakia, native could not connect cleanly, and the score remained 2-1.
“We did well to respond to their first goal by shifting the play onto their half of the field which resulted in us scoring and equalising,” first-year midfielder Marko Isakovic said. “Even after we conceded the second goal, we continued creating chances, but we just got unlucky with not scoring another goal.”
The two teams stayed close throughout the second half, with both sides creating chances, until the Wildcats were able to extend their lead to 3-1 in the 72nd minute. Nilsson came off his line to clear a bouncing long ball at the corner of the box but was beaten in the air by the New Hampshire striker who then tapped the ball into the open net to all but end the Crimson’s chances of coming back.
“We held our own against one of the highest-ranked teams in the nation on away turf,” Isakovic said of the match. “That, combined with the momentum of our wins against Merrimack and Vermont, makes me confident that we can get a positive result on Saturday.”
Harvard opens Ivy League play away at Yale this Saturday at 7 p.m., with the matchup coming almost two years to the day after their last meeting, which came on Oct. 4, 2019. The Crimson leads the all-time series 55-39-12 and will look to build on that plus-16 margin on Saturday.

Recruitment season has just ended and all the clubs have been hard at work looking for new members. From flooding email lists, offering free foods and drinks, to promising awesome merch (though unfortunately for all the Wall Street bankers wannabe, Patagonia is no longer an option), every single organization at Harvard is pulling out all the stops to woo new members. With that said, the hardest worker of all must be that semi-secret Sorrento square social organization that used to occasionally publish an allegedly humor magazine. For a “secret” organization, they sure are desperate for members.
If you are still confused about this organization — that for tradition’s sake legal reasons we cannot mention by name — and their try-hard ways, let us walk you through their various (and questionable) recruitment efforts.
That magazine that was put in everyone’s mailbox the first week of school
Here’s the thing about being a secret organization with a purpose to party only 95% of the time: you want to make sure to advertise the entire purpose of the org to potential compers before you crush them with your elitist comping process. The usual Harvard students have only heard of the name in passing and know of the off-kilter building that perhaps some would consider an eyesore. To generate more buzz and interest, a magazine was dropped into every room’s mailbox to show just what exactly this organization, whose name is composed of the first three letters of a certain 24/5 Harvard library and the second half of a harpoon gun, is capable of. Is this their best work? Probably not. But hey, maybe they’re recruiting for some new blood and better writers.
Effort: Average. Props to the people who went to every dorm to drop off the magazine. I hope your step counts for that week were good.
Environmental damage: The amount of electricity and ink as well as paper spent on this… all those emissions. :-(
Does this make me want to comp? Nah
Overall rating: 2/10
The fake syllabus 
pov: it’s the first day of class and you’re a student in Gov 20 or Psy 1 or any iconic large Harvard course, and people are passing out syllabi at the doors. Being a typical eager Harvard student, you immediately try to get your hands on one of them, only to realize later what a complete bogus the piece of paper in your hand is. “Not one of the jokes hit,” shared Ian H. Thompson ‘25, a student in GENED 1091 who threw away the syllabus pretty quickly. A student in PSY 1, Birukti Tsige ‘23, did have a laugh about the syllabus but was mostly confused. She originally thought the professor was messing with her before realizing on second read that the jokes were “so ridiculous and terrible.”
Effort: Did they even try? At least with the magazine, I could give some points for the manual labor required. But this? For a club that’s supposed to be funny, they can do better.
Environmental damage: I hope the amount of trees that were sacrificed for this prank keeps you up at night.
Does this make me want to comp? No. Though I do want to give them some jokes books after this.
Overall rating: -3/10
Excessive flyering 
Maybe they just have never heard about “quality over quantity”, but for some reason, excessive flyering seems to be a good idea for this organization whose name is the second Google search result of “publicly criticize (someone or something) by using ridicule, irony, or sarcasm.”
First of all, taking up all the bulletin space everywhere? Total jerk move. Though, I gotta thank them for the free thumbtack pin and tape that I stole from the flyers in order to use on my own flyer. What cannot be forgiven, though, was the paper-covered atrocity surrounding a certain building in between Adams and Lowell.
Effort: did negative energy go into this?
Environmental damage: Let’s just hope someone is nice enough to recycle all those papers.
Does this make me want to comp? Is there a word for wanting to anti-comp an org?
Overall rating: -128472345105
The fake Crimson newspaper
This is actually clever, I gotta admit. Unfortunately, any potential enjoyment for the fake article was spoiled by that slavery joke. It’s 2021. You can do so much better, Ampoon-Lay.
Effort: Probably required the most effort out of the four
Environmental damage: I’m convinced that everyone in this organization hates trees.
Does this make me want to comp? O-nay
Overall rating: -∞
So there you have it, our totally honest and unbiased ranking of that organization’s recruitment methods. And for any members of that Pinocchio-shaped building reading this, do better next year.
