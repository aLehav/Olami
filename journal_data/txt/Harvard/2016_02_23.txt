After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The HBO documentary “Jim: The James Foley Story” recounts the life and imprisonment of American journalist James Foley in the years leading up to his brutal execution. Directed by Jim’s childhood friend Brian Oakes, the film is more personal tribute than hard journalism. Despite this fact, it still deals adeptly with broader themes of war and civilian life, as well as the deep regret and confusion that Foley’s family and friends experienced in the aftermath of his death.
The first half of the documentary focuses mainly on Foley’s career. Using interviews from family and fellow journalists, as well some of Foley’s own video footage, Oakes explores the personal profile of a man who was driven to the unconventional. Relatives describe Foley’s forays into various careers, including Teach for America. In this segment, Oakes seeks primarily to make sense of Foley’s trajectory from suburban New England to turbulent Libya and Syria—but the question is never fully answered, creating a lingering sense of ambiguity that mirrors the emotionally unsettled state of Foley’s family.
Oakes trusts the audience to connect with Foley, and his interviews reflect this fact, teasing out insights into the world of contrasts Foley inhabited. In one scene, a conflict journalist discusses the “deep absurdity” present in everyday life, then reflects upon the contrast between the abundance of the United States and the intense turmoil of the countries in which Foley worked. The comparison felt natural, and Oakes did not fall back on the “us vs them” dichotomy that characterizes many documentaries of the Middle East. Foley’s own footage shows his engagement with people whose struggles he wanted to make known. Oakes does not foist Foley’s goodness on us; rather he uses interviews and stories to convey a beautifully human image.
Unfortunately, the strength of the first half of the documentary is not matched by the second, which primarily focuses on Foley’s imprisonment and death. It is in this section that Oakes withdraws his trust in the audience. Instead of the same subtle emotion he used in the first half, the director relies on dim lighting and tritely emotional music. The result is a contrived mood that takes away from the interviews with Foley’s fellow prisoners. During these interviews, the tone shifts from the good-natured reflection of Jake’s family members and fellow reporters to eulogy. Instead of the endearingly realistic Foley who showed up to an interview with paint-splattered trousers, the Foley in this half is, according to a German prisoner, a force of “pure good,”a descriptor that undermines the nuanced portrait created in the documentary’s first half.
One of the only strengths of the documentary’s latter half is the emotional range conveyed by Foley’s fellow prisoners. Their commentary ranges from political insight to personal memories and adds a level of nuance not found elsewhere in the film. Their reflections on the psychological and physical torture that they experienced are especially effective when contrasted with shots of the serenely suburban setting of the Foley family home. Luckily, the documentary ends on this note; as the Foleys reflect on their son’s death, there is a return to the same sense of emotion present at the beginning of the documentary. Oakes once again allows his interview subjects to reflect at their own pace, this time without the weighty thud of formulaic music.
“Jim: The James Foley Story” is a well-told homage from one childhood friend to another. While it occasionally suffers from manufactured moments, it recovers from this flaw with intimate interviews with Foley’s family and friends. The overarching narrative effectively illustrates the nuances of Foley’s life and mission while simultaneously drawing attention to the larger ideas of war and loss that interweave in Foley’s story.

The recently released music video for Hozier’s “Cherry Wine” is filled with scenes of tender romance. A woman sits before her dressing table, contemplating her face in the mirror, as she slowly removes her makeup. She flashes back to memories with her boyfriend. The two stumble into the living room, laughing and tangled in an affectionate embrace, and break apart from each other just long enough for him to pour a glass of wine. Then they tumble together onto the couch. A brief shot of a framed picture of the woman kissing a child drifts by. The couple seem to have a loving relationship, and the warm yellow-toned lighting also suggests a happy scene. Why, then, does the woman’s face look so sad as she regards herself in the mirror?
The answer is revealed about halfway through the video: As she wipes away the makeup from her left eye, she uncovers the dark blotchy purple of a bruise. The image is chilling, shocking, and disturbing, in contrast with the warm and tender scenes previously shown. The man is briefly shown lying on the couch rubbing his eyes in frustration and perhaps regret, but no other hints are given of violence or abuse. Most poignantly, as the woman examines her bruised eye in the mirror, a hand taps her shoulder, and as she turns her head she is swept into a tender kiss. She and her partner embrace and caress each other’s faces as she forces a smile. Clearly she will forgive him, if she has not already.
Hozier’s throaty voice and the melancholy and minimal guitar accompaniment create a touching and painfully pitiful mood. Hozier soothingly blends the words of the lyrics together as he sings, “It looks ugly, but it’s clean / Oh momma, don’t fuss over me. The way she tells me I’m hers and she is mine / Open hand or closed fist would be fine / Blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine.” The scenarios he describes fit into the bigger picture of the broken relationship.
The music video shows a loving romance through the woman’s eyes, but still neither she nor the viewer can forget or look away from the blackened area around her eye, which seems strange and inconsistent with the other scenes in the video. The conflict between the woman’s sun-tinted happy memories with her partner and the undeniable ugliness and brutality of her bruise creates a heart-wrenching paradox for her and the viewer alike. Hozier’s music video for “Cherry Wine” is part of his campaign to support domestic abuse charities, and he presents his message powerfully and sympathetically, capturing the nuances of the victim’s emotions and the difficulties of leaving an abusive relationship.

“The Next World” opens with the riffs of Boston’s “More Than a Feeling” playing over Rick, Michonne, and a now one-eyed Carl doing household chores. Making a new supply run, the group’s new priorities consist of recovering more toothpaste, restocking their supply of Spearmint Mentos, and finding cans of Orange Crush, marking a temporal and tonal departure from the last episode’s barbaric havoc and a return to the show’s typical rhythm of soulful character building. It is a procedural “day in the life” episode that mostly takes place outside a mending Alexandria, comprised of self-contained, intimate parables about the importance of family and conscience in a ravaged world.
An altercation with a new male character called “Jesus” evolves into a clash between Daryl’s cautious isolationism and Rick’s newfound compassion—an about-face for both characters since Alexandria’s fall. Living up to his name, Jesus defies most of Rick and Daryl’s attempts to keep him captive through what can only be superhuman agility and Mr. Fantastic’s flexibility. A bearded Tom Payne plays Jesus with a playful air of duplicity: an amiable, innocent face masking the deadly skills of a martial artist and an uncanny omnipresence. Jesus’ persistence in antagonizing our survivors forces them to decide between leaving him behind or integrating him into Alexandria. While Daryl unwillingly concedes to Rick’s mercy, there is no question that there exists a deep warmth and kindness underneath Daryl’s cold exterior. Daryl’s sense of charity, evident in his countless altruistic actions to preserve the group, may be challenged by what he deems to be Jesus’ true nature. His foreign presence will be our survivors’ impetus to explore beyond their safe borders and will likely lead them into the hands of the much-anticipated Negan.
With the help of Michonne and Carl, Spencer ventures into the woods to find and bury his mother, Deanna, granting him spiritual revitalization and emotional closure after the loss of his entire family. Michonne teaches Spencer that family in this new world is bound not by blood but by the loyalty and sympathy they hold for each other—a beautiful thought and message, albeit hamfisted into three schmaltzy lines. Michonne and Rick’s out-of-left-field yet adorable romance, however, remains somewhat questionable in light of the fact that Rick was forced to amputate his previous girlfriend’s hand and witness her dismemberment-by-zombie in the last episode.
“The Next World” is a quaint episode steeped in more sentimentality and figurative group hugs than “Full House.”  With the reaffirmation of the characters’ convictions to persevere, the stage has been set for new threats to enter and threaten their little moment of peace.

Joshua L. Oppenheimer ’96, a Copenhagen-based documentary filmmaker and graduate of the Visual and Environmental Studies department, returned to the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts on Wednesday to present his new film, “The Look of Silence.”  The event featured an introduction from University President Drew G. Faust and an audience question and answer session with Oppenheimer.
Nominated for this year’s Academy Award in the Best Documentary Feature category, “The Look of Silence” is a companion piece to Oppenheimer’s acclaimed directorial debut, “The Act of Killing.” Both films focus on the 1965-1966 Indonesian genocide, during which army-backed civilian militias killed between 500,000 and one million people, most of them accused of leftist political leanings. While “The Act of Killing” centers on the perpetrators, Oppenheimer’s new film follows the journey of Indonesian optician Adi Rukun as he confronts the men who killed his brother during the genocide.
In her opening remarks, Faust praised Oppenheimer’s works for their powerful use of the film medium to confront violence and tragedy. “I remember watching his 2012 documentary ‘The Act of Killing,’” she said. “The film was in many ways overwhelming and ineffable, a work of art as much felt as it is seen and heard.” Faust added that in her opinion “The Look of Silence” brought new depth to Oppenheimer’s work.
In his question and answer with the audience, Oppenheimer discussed the making of the film. “In many ways ‘The Look of Silence’ was the film I first set out to make,” he said. “The family at the center of the film was the family that I began my work with back in 2003, but they were threatened by the army not to participate three weeks into our work together.” According to Oppenheimer, governmental pressures on the genocide survivors forced him to turn his focus to the perpetrators, which led to “The Act of Killing.”
Oppenheimer explained that upon finishing “The Act of Silence,” he found Rukun again and picked up the work that he had left behind. Making the second film, he said, involved significant risks. “[We had] a getaway car for Adi so that he could leave the houses of the perpetrators as soon as we were done,” said Oppenheimer. “[Rukun’s] family [would be] waiting at the airport with their backpacks, ready to get on the next flight out if anything went wrong.”
While “The Look of Silence” centers on Rukun’s personal struggle, the film also touches on the way the genocide is presented today in Indonesian history curricula, which according to Oppenheimer conceal the full scale of the violence and villainize Indonesian communists. During the question and answer session, he explained that he seeks to counter such distortions of history through his work. “I had this feeling that any sustainable evil depends on an immoral imagination that naturalizes it,” he said. “You can expose that evil, but you also need to expose the working of that lie. And I think usually [a lie] is effective not because people don’t know it’s a lie …. It’s because people don’t want to acknowledge the fear that prevents them from challenging the lie.” He said that he sees his own films as a means to begin that challenge. “From the very beginning of my time here, I am drawn to expose the working of hypocrisy so that it doesn’t work anymore,” he said.
According to Oppenheimer, this incomplete view of history persists not only in Indonesia but also in the United States. He alluded to the accumulating evidence that the United States government sponsored the militias and provided a list of thousands of suspected communists to the army. “Just yesterday we were in Washington at a meeting at the State Department about the urgency [for] the United States to declassify its files on the 1965 killing and to acknowledge its role in the crime, without hypocrisy, as a perpetrator,” he said.
Oppenheimer ended his talk with a call for concrete action from the audience. He urged his listeners to go to his film’s website, which includes a link to sign Senator Thomas Udall’s 2014 petition to the United States government to declassify its files on the 1965 genocide. “Sign it, then ask all your friends to sign it, and then ask all their friends to sign it,” he said.

January has barely passed, and yet 2016 has already seen the release of two critically acclaimed, brutal movies about early America: “The Revenant” chronicles a fur trader’s harrowing quest for revenge on the man who left him for dead, while “The Hateful Eight” depicts a series of bloody conflicts between snowed-in bounty hunters. In his debut work, “The Witch,” director Robert Eggers continues this trend. Though considerably lower profile and more genre-horror in tone than the other two, the movie nonetheless explores the viciousness of colonial America with at least as much nuance and stylistic grace. In weaving together visual horror, family drama, and historical meditation, “The Witch” proves itself a thoughtful folk tale of bone-chilling beauty.
The drama centers on a small Puritan family in 17th century New England, who have just been banished from their plantation home under unknown circumstances. Driven by religious fervor, the close-knit group start their own farm at the edge of a vast forest. All the usual frontier torments—hunger, loneliness, poverty—push the family to their limits, but all seems bearable until darker, stranger things begin to happen. Slowly, the family members turn on one another, eventually ostracizing their adolescent daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) as a witch while their farm becomes a version of hell itself.
As the nightmare unfolds, the film’s craftsmanship remains consistently enthralling. Each shot is inventively, expressively arranged: Disorienting verticals layer against each other, figures stand dwarfed at the bottom of the frame, and audience members often find themselves suggestively breathing down necks. The very composition of each image contributes to the sense of omnipresent evil. This visual precision extends to the color palette, too, which adeptly moves from stark blues and grays to hellish golden firelight in an expression of the family’s vulnerability and internal anguish.
The compelling visuals also become the movie’s primary means of disturbance. Unlike many modern horror films that rely on either manipulative jump scares or the cheap suspense of the unseen, “The Witch” holds its elegant terrors in plain sight: A possessed boy’s naked body bends slightly the wrong way, a black door slowly consumes the screen, a goat’s udder spurts blood, and animals betray unsettling intelligence in their stares. Even Satan himself makes a subtle appearance, and the result is real, impressively daring scariness.
The central horror of the story, though, might have less to do with the supernatural evil that engulfs the farm and more to do with the distrust that erodes it from the inside. The strong set of actors all succeed at creating devout, loving people with their own private sins and aches and eventually make the subsequent spiral into madness likewise complex and believable. Taylor-Joy does effectively subtle work as young Thomasin, though the two adult actors—Ralph Ineson as William and Kate Dickie as Katherine—nonetheless stand out in their wrenching portrayal of a pair caught between love, fear, expectation, and religious belief.
This internal ideological and emotional war anchors the film’s captivating historical musings as well as its domestic aspects. Why, the film seems to ask, would a settler imagine witches or want to become one? Total vulnerability and loneliness are clearly part of the answer—the film’s forest-dwelling witch often seems to be an expression of the horrifying power of the wilderness—but societal structures also become relevant. Eggers thoughtfully investigates the stark, restrictive social world of the Puritans and in particular the heavy burden of Calvinism: Continuous hard work and loss, coupled with the assurance of a sinful nature and the possibility of hell, drive all the characters to the edge of their faith, particularly middle brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw). The pressure eventually seems sufficient to make anyone step out of their bodies and sign their names in Satan’s book. The freedom of evil, it seems, can be too much to resist.
Given the general scope and nuance of the film’s thinking, though, one omission seems odd: “The Witch” largely avoids the gendered elements of the witch myth. Most literature on the subject frames oppressive female social roles and fear of feminine sexuality as central components of historical witch-fear; however, Thomasin’s plight never seems particularly female-specific, and her family includes her younger brother in their suspicions. The film briefly considers Thomasin’s pubescence and Caleb’s emergent sexuality, but ultimately it relegates both to peripheral concerns. On the whole, the brief flashes of sexual awareness lack any of the charge you might expect in a film about witches. But this absence hardly detracts from the overall quality of the movie: As is, “The Witch” offers visceral and intellectual shivers to spare.

“It’s open-ended, not tied to anything specific,” comic artist Dave Ortega said at the opening of his installation “Comics: Frame by Frame” at the Institute of Contemporary Art on Friday. The installation features movable black-and-white images mounted over the walls and gridded tables covered in doodles, where visitors can brainstorm and interact with each other.
Ortega said that the 50 individual panels he designed for the piece are open to interpretation, with paper stick-on bubbles provided for visitors to add dialogue. He invited visitors to make their own stories and especially encouraged children to participate in the installation.
According to Ortega, this new program, available daily to anyone who wanders into the Art Lab, is about how we each build our own stories. “Societies shape history … by sorting information and imposing narrative arcs,” Ortega said. He emphasized that a very big part of life is trying to make sense of what may feel chaotic in the moment. By allowing the visitors to create a virtual life through comics, Ortega hoped to inspire reflections on the real life.
“It’s an all-encompassing art installation,” said Monica Garza, the ICA’s director of education, in an interview. “Bright walls when you walk in, a banner. Each wall has a different story.”
When discussing “Comics: Frame by Frame,” Ortega mentioned a series of works he self-published last fall, based on the memories of his now 101-year-old grandmother who was born at the height of the Mexican Revolution. Ortega had spent years interviewing her, but in the process of creating this series, he was nevertheless challenged by historical gaps in the story. “I need to make creative decisions as to how to fill them,” he said, “I want to avoid melodrama and sentimentality; the best way to do it is to just be as straightforward as I can and let the natural drama do its own work.”
Ortega said in an interview that it was at times difficult to understand his grandmother’s perspective. “Seeing history through her eyes is difficult, because you can’t really empathize with hardship when you have it so good,” he said. “It would be disingenuous of me to try that.” When asked about what inspired him to start the series, he said that it was a combination of his own curiosity and an urge to tell the world of her stories. “I wish I had started asking questions earlier,” he said. “I am almost in shame in not being serious enough in the past about knowing my grandma’s story.”
Linking the series to his current project at the ICA, Ortega explained that it was all about how to create a good narrative of one’s life stories. According to him, it is easy to be sucked into the aesthetics and to become locked into a particular mode of storytelling when dealing with comics or any other visual media, at the cost of the integrity of the story. One should not focus entirely on how well a drawing is rendered, he said; rather, a good comic is made up of three things: pictures, words, and a magical something-else.
“This is what the ICA project is about: the exploration of that ‘something else,’” he said. “Juxtaposing one image with another does something in our brain to create a narrative. It’s a way that we want to tell stories—through the stuff that’s around us. Like the cavemen forming stories out of constellations. Comics are an extension of that. They force us to make relationships and draw inferences between panels.”
According to Ortega, the goal of his project is to help people come away with a better understanding of comics. “I want to create a curiosity in people about the art form and to get people to start wondering,” he said. Comic-making, he added, is an innate thing that children tend to want to do, and he hopes to encourage it. “I want to help them sustain the curiosity to tell the stories of their lifetimes,” he said.
Ortega also offered advice for anyone interested in venturing into the field: “Storytelling always has a gravitas, which could be a stumbling block for some people. The whole process will be full of all kinds of mistakes, false starts, randomness, and you should be welcoming to all that. Know what your goals are and know what has come before you, and most importantly, trust yourself.”
“Comics: Frame by Frame,” will be shown at the ICA through June 26. Ortega will be on set on April 22 to demonstrate and interact with the audience.

“Diversity is about unity,” Lucy Liu said at Sanders Theater on Saturday night, “Separation and segregation—that’s about fear and ignorance.” Liu, a UNICEF ambassador and former “Charlie’s Angels” actress, was named Harvard University's 2016 Artist of the Year at the Harvard Foundation’s 31st Cultural Rhythms show, where she spoke about diversity and acceptance. “It is our job to present who we are, and stand up for it.”
Liu, a long-time advocate for gender equality and opponent of human trafficking, was greeted by a prolonged ovation as she received her plaque and a Harvard sweatshirt. “We always look at a number of people—usually artists of color or minority backgrounds who have made some amazing accomplishments in the arts but who have also done some incredible work in philanthropy,” says Cultural Rhythms co-director Avni Nahar ’17, who is also a former blog exec of the Crimson. “Lucy Liu fits that bill.”
Liu’s message was complemented by an eclectic array of performances by student groups. Harvard’s The Kuumba Singers, a choir dedicated to celebrating black identity, kicked off the show with a song about love, peace, and unity. The Harvard Philippine Forum followed later with a traditional dance of rural farmers in the Northern Philippines, jumping over and around stacked benches with partners in hand. Harvard Taekwondo mixed traditional martial arts with contemporary fight scenes, breaking boards and cartwheeling over each other to Ariana Grande’s “Problem.” The Asian American Dance Troupe finished off the show with their performance, “Memoir of the Fallen Warrior,” as they formed a human mountain for one dancer to roll down on.
In between performances, Liu led short talks with performers to learn about the cultural or personal significance behind the shows. Sitting in a green wooden chair on the side of the stage, she asked about the students’ own experiences with the arts, as well as the history or cultural significance behind certain dances or musical instruments. In one of these talks, Liu was surprised to find a number of Asian members in Mariachi Veritas, which plays Mexican folk music. Some members of Mariachi Veritas did not speak Spanish, but could sing the songs in the language.
This turned out to be a common situation in the evening: several other groups also featured performers of different ethnicities, even though they were closely related to a specific culture. “There are so many people on the team that are not Indian or that are not even familiar with the dance and its history,” says Sapna V. Rampersaud ’19, a member of Harvard Bhangra, a group whose performances combine Punjabi traditional dance with Western forms. “That’s what means a lot to me—there are so many people that are so interested in it.”
Other cultural groups performing on Saturday night included Omo Naija, a Nigerian dance troupe that melds West African culture with contemporary styles, Harvard College Candela Dance Troupe, a Latin dance group, and a student trio that fused Indian dance and Chinese music. Other non-cultural groups included EXP, Passus, and KeyChange.
“We were all kind of sharing in this one experience of celebrating our unique cultures and also the coming together of these unique cultures,” Harvard Bhangra member Anjali Chandra ’19 says, echoing Liu’s previous statements. “It was really special.”
“I hope students will have a greater understanding of the diversity that exists here at Harvard. I know we talk about diversity a lot, but I think it’s different when you actually see your classmates perform a piece of their heritage that’s so integral to them and learn a little bit about what that means,” said Nahar. “I think diversity means a lot of different things, but I think inherently it just recognizes the fact that we are all different in different ways and different aspects of our identity. That doesn’t mean that there isn’t commonality there. It’s learning to both appreciate those differences and find their similarities.”

In 1853, Englishman Philip Henry Gosse published “A Naturalist’s Rambles on the Devonshire Coast,” a book about marine life illustrated with gorgeous, vivid lithographs. A year later, in its sequel, he introduced the public to the concept of “The Aquarium,” with prints that were even more lush and spectacular. Well in the throes of a passion for natural history, the Victorian public went wild. As historian Lynn Barber wrote, a few years after the publication of Gosse’s books, “it was impossible to visit the seaside without tripping over parties of earnest ladies and gentlemen, armed with a book by Mr. Gosse and a collection of jamjars, standing knee-deep in rock-pools and prodding at sea-anemones.”
Prior to Gosse, the natural history of invertebrates had been a rather neglected field. To enhance their appeal, his works promoted the fun of collecting creatures that Gosse described as living jewels. A ring of jellyfish was a “coronet of sparkling diamonds”; a bivalve held up as “the pearl of the Orient”; a genus of worm hailed as “liveried in emerald and gold.” Gosse’s glittering marketing succeeded, but perhaps too greatly. The British coasts, ravaged by armies of greedy hoarders, sustained severe ecological damage, a fact that would cause the environmentally-minded author deep regret.
Jewels demand storage commensurate with their splendor. Years before, a wave of inexpensive plate glass had flooded the English market. Long accomplished through laborious and tedious grinding, the polishing of plate glass sped up with the introduction of steam power in the late 18th century. The new technology anticipated an era of cheap and widespread availability, but the heavy taxes that funded British wars had stifled the product’s diffusion. In 1845, however, Parliament decided to repeal the English glass tax. Record low glass prices, coupled with Gosse’s writings, gave rise to the modern aquarium. By the time Leopold Blaschka, glass-smith extraordinaire, began constructing his sea creatures, flamboyantly decorated aquaria had become de rigeur in wealthy American and European households: plate glass displays for their owners’ new gems.
The ‘period eye’ of late 19th century enthusiasts was trained to treasure invertebrates as glittering baubles, objects to be displayed and admired. Leopold Blaschka began his modelling enterprise in this cultural clime. In 1863, an English expatriate lent the glassworker a copy of “Actinologia Britannica: A History of British Sea Anemones and Corals,” written and illustrated by––of course––Philip Henry Gosse.
Along with the book, he gave Leopold the wise advice that glass sea creatures would be highly in demand. Despite their status as the day’s fashionable accessory, invertebrates were notoriously difficult to keep alive. In “The Aquarium,” Gosse himself recommended that “the vessel should be occasionally looked over … to see if there be any of the specimens dead.” Jarred in preservatives, however, the flesh lost its beauty: Colors faded, tissues shrank and bloated. Glass, like life, was fragile,... but, unlike life, could continue indefinitely without maintenance. Through the chance assistance of a Gosse aficionado, the philosophy of a man who saw invertebrates as jewels thus fell into the hands of a skilled jeweler. Joined later by his talented son, Leopold Blaschka meticulously made literal Gosse’s metaphor.

Depending on whom you ask, in 2016, we could be witnessing the doomsday of recorded music or the birth of music as a truly liberated artform. The meteoric rise of streaming services—and the persistent disruptivity of the internet in general—has forced the industry to evolve into something almost unrecognizable. The late pop titan David Bowie, in a firmly enthusiastic interview with BBC in 1999, predicted the internet’s widespread force. “I think the potential of what the internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable,” Bowie said. The immediacy of content available via the internet is certainly terrifying, both for label execs and for artists who are paid cents a month for thousands of plays. While greater availability radically democratizes people’s access to music, it can compromise the valuation of the music itself, and the ease of consumption can cut into the uniqueness of a person’s music library. Shelves of well-loved, weathered albums are largely giving way to an ever-shifting repertoire of digital tracks “available offline.”
On the flip side, those same streaming services give artists a potential immediate audience of billions. Bowie recognized, even prior to the ubiquity of the internet, the importance of the interface between creator and listener, stressing, “The piece of work is not finished until the audience come to it and add their own interpretation. What the piece of art is about is the gray space in the middle.” Bowie identified that space, in which the audience’s engagement with artist and art begins to control the work itself, as the 21st century’s artistic focus.
Music in particular was ripe for an evolution of this gray space, especially given how it was commercially consumed; before digital music, almost all popular music was produced by an artist, put through a slow process of mass-production, and distributed via physical channels. The “gray space” that Bowie mentioned, in that situation, remained somewhat static. The interface between art and audience lay in the tactile grip on the record, the LP’s mesmerizing spin on the turntable, and the communities that formed around those records. The digital redefinition of music lent itself to much more purposeful manipulation of that gray space. Digital music can appear in spaces it wasn’t seen before—places where the audience reigns, like social media feeds. And a digital file is much more ethereal and flexible than a physical disc; with the malleability of the physical medium comes the malleability of that theoretical gray space.
Some artists have simply filled that gray space with something earnest and personal. Media like Twitter and Snapchat allow for candid communication between artists and those consuming their music and grant listeners insight into the creative guts of a project. If you follow ScHoolboy Q on Snapchat, you’ll learn a lot about his relationship with his daughter. You’ll also witness 10-second clips of his late nights in the studio as he records the album he’ll release this year. Recently, Kanye West has taken gray space experimentation to its almost preposterous extreme, turning his Twitter feed into a ranting, angry, scandalous, introspective, defiantly hopeful tabloid’s paradise through the lead-up and release of his album “The Life of Pablo.” The almost unprecedentedly messy rollout of TLOP morphs those liminal zones between artist, art, and audience into something almost unintelligible, and the ensuing range of reactions—spanning everything from absolute hate to worry about mental disease—illustrates how in addition to the space that exists between art and audience, a space exists between artist and art. Once a piece is released, especially in the music world, it’s beyond an artist’s control. The stakes in this gray zone are high.
Like Kanye, some artists mold the gray area into something convoluted—take, for example, electronic artist Daniel Lopatin (a.k.a. Oneohtrix Point Never) and his release of 2015’s “Garden of Delete.” The way the album was originally introduced is too complicated to explain completely, but suffice it to say that it started with a goofy PDF and journeyed through everything from fictional metal bands to maddeningly cryptic blogspots to the story of an adolescent extraterrestrial. That last point, interestingly enough, seems to have its roots in Lopatin’s reconnection with his adolescence while opening for Nine Inch Nails. Lopatin morphed that gray space into something labyrinthine in itself, before the audience even made it to the “art” of his album. Discovering the relationship between artist, art, and audience is just as subtle, complex, and rewarding as listening to the album itself.
Bowie didn’t just predict these trends—he participated in them himself. The album art for “Blackstar,” released just before his death in January, is common-source; his audience can explore their relationship with the album themselves, manipulating it as they like. That gray space, a negative space not typically breached before the internet, has become our time’s most important artistic frontier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“E X I S T,” so styled, is something else. Following her failure to obtain the rights to “Small Mouth Sounds,” Elizabeth B.H. O’Donnell ’17 assembled an original piece of, well, something. Theater probably isn’t the right word, since even the biggest shaggy dog story of a play has some kind of narrative movement. Performance art might be closer. Something contrived or constructed is performed, at any rate. Whatever it is, it can’t really be reviewed, or at least not by me.
I guess it makes the most sense to try to break down “E X I S T” in a factual kind of way first. “E X I S T” is one of those self-styled immersive experiences with that totalitarian expectation of audience participation. With this in mind, attendees are compelled to remove their coats and shoes at the door before entering the theater. The arrangement of the theater itself (one cannot say the stage, because there is no stage proper) is at least striking: a well-lit central open box of sorts with a wood floor and a waist-high partition, large enough to fit roughly thirty people comfortably, surrounded by a fairly broad avenue that is punctuated with linen banners hanging from the ceiling. If nothing else, the set makes full use of the Loeb Ex’s space.
Audience members find comfortable altitudes in the box, which is strewn with pillows and a few benches. Aislinn E. Brophy ’17 acts as a meditation leader; Hanna E. Psychas ’17 is a late-comer to the meditation. After the exercise, Brophy asks if there are any questions; Eliza B. Mantz ’18 and Thomas W. Peterson ’18 both stand and deliver impassioned outbursts about whatever dissatisfactions are in their lives or their characters’ lives. (It is always unclear in “E X I S T” what is fiction and what is just stylized reality.) Following this, cast members take audience members out of the box singly or in pairs until only Brophy remains in the box. Audience members are then led or dragged on an eccentric pilgrimage between miniature performances, which generally involve cast members talking about their (or their characters’) private miseries or problems. This period of peregrination culminates in an induced dance party back in the box.
That’s a rough summary of what happens. Now it’s time to evaluate, and that’s hard. Criticism, especially theater criticism, relies first of all on a roughly coherent external text that can be evaluated by semi- or pseudo-objective standards—at the end of the day, you can say with some semi- or pseudo-objectivity that it’s good art or it’s bad art. The critic responds to the play as he would respond to an argument, by judging in affirmation or rejection through reason. Reviewing “E X I S T,” however, is a bit like reviewing a roller coaster or a tent revival. The thing’s conceit is drawing the audience into its own world with its own logic. The critic is faced with two choices. On the one hand, he can hold himself off from the experience, seeking to turn himself more than ever into a great objective angelic eye. This approach is pretty honest but threatens to destroy the thing being reviewed, which is by its own self-definition experience-based; it raises the question if the reviewer taking this approach is even qualified to evaluate, since he may not even be able to apprehend the aesthetic thing that is notionally under review.
On the other hand, he can throw himself into the experience, feel all there is to be felt, and generally suck the marrow out of the the thing that’s happening. When it comes time to sit down and write the review, he can now completely perjure himself in one of two ways: He can deny his own experience and proceed along the now spurious objective-seeming path, or he can write truthfully about the experience, in which case he is not really a critic, as he was himself by his own admission an actor in whatever occurred and so has forfeited any claim on objectivity.
My own natural and cultivated tendencies are in the angelic eyeball direction, so I stuck with the first approach. My findings were this: The actors perform convincingly. The set is well-made and original. The conceit is bold.
On the other hand, most of what happens seems pretty silly, in the ’60s-influenced hippy-dippy primal-screaming hangups-hungup psychobabble pseudo-mystical vein that I thought and hoped was all but dead outside Sedona. I think I can honestly say that even without the conscious effort towards the objective-angelic, the whole thing is simply unappealing to my own tastes. But at the end of the day, I can’t say with definitiveness that it was bad. I didn’t say “yes” to the experience, and so maybe there was some magic that happens there for the initiated that does not happen for the unbeliever.
“E X I S T” runs Feb. 19 to 27 in the Loeb Experimental Theater.

Tucked away in a quiet lawn behind the much larger and more bustling Science Center, Paine Hall, the home of Harvard’s Music Department, may seem like an unlikely center for radical innovation on campus. Yet when the building’s namesake, German-trained composer and organist John Knowles Paine, became Harvard’s first professor of music in 1875, he founded the first university music department in America. Paine established a curriculum centered on the Western canon—Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and other composers in the classical music tradition—that has remained at the core of the department ever since.
Today, however, a new generation of musicians and academics at Harvard is advancing a more broadly inclusive, socially committed model of music scholarship. In the last ten years, new faculty hires have brought fresh perspectives on music outside the Western canon to the department. Last semester, the department announced its intention to review and reform the undergraduate music curriculum, a process that is currently ongoing. Yet engagement with music outside the Western classical tradition at Harvard still often takes place outside the Music Department. Hip-hop and even jazz often receive scholarly attention more as sociological or ethnographic material than as musical forms. Many students in the department, moreover, remain ambivalent about broadening the music curriculum’s geographic and historical scope.
Far from being purely academic or aesthetic pursuits, making, hearing, and studying music at Harvard increasingly intersect with broader conversations about social change. The politics of music—who makes it, who listens to it, who studies it, and what criteria we use to distinguish it from noise—remain contested on campus.
In some ways, music might seem an unlikely sphere for social or political action. Music speaks in a language that both practicing musicians and scholars acknowledge often remains resistant to interpretation. “Music is discursive, but not in the way that speaking is discursive,” says Vijay Iyer, a composer, jazz pianist, and one of the Music Department’s recently hired faculty. “How music says anything is much more diffuse.”

For the listener too, articulating what music means and how it speaks can be almost impossible. Eric R. Corcoran ’16, a joint concentrator in music and English, says that he thinks that musical literacy is much more difficult to develop than other more ubiquitous subjects—for example, skill in analyzing literature. “One thing that’s difficult with a subject like music, as opposed to a subject like English, is that there’s so much of an esoteric vocabulary about it,” he says. “When we’re all in elementary school, we’re taught what alliteration is, we’re taught what similes and metaphors are, but we’re not necessarily taught what French augmented sixth chords are.”
Yet for the new faculty at the Music Department, music and its academic study are inevitably bound up with social and political questions: questions about identity, community, history, and ownership. Three of the department’s recent hires are Ingrid T. Monson, hired in 2001 as professor of African American music; Iyer, hired as professor of the arts in 2014; and jazz saxophonist and composer Yosvany Terry, hired in 2015 as a senior lecturer and the director of Harvard’s jazz bands. All three bring to the department an attention to music outside the Western canon, particularly jazz and other music coming out of the African American experience and the African diaspora.
Faculty in the department say that they are conscious of a shift in its orientation. “Our Music Department at Harvard has changed a lot in the past 10 years. A younger generation of scholars has come in, and many of the classical musicologists are more open-minded now to a broad range of music,” Monson says. “We want to have different paths in the Music Department for people who are interested in different kinds of music.”
Monson emphasizes that she sees her teaching, which centers on the music of the African diaspora, as informed by social concerns. “Music has a special place in the cultural tradition, because it’s the one place where African American culture has historically been considered better, not less, than [white culture],” she says. “It inverts the racial hierarchy.” For Monson, acknowledging the origins of jazz and other genres of music in the African American community is an essential part of studying that music. “To me, that’s the ethical point from which you have to start: Let’s look at where this came from, who were the primary innovators. You can’t erase that, whatever you do,” she says. “The colorblind racism moment comes when people want to say, ‘Well, it’s everybody’s music now.’”

She adds that her spring 2016 course, “From R & B to Neo Soul: Black Popular Music and Cultural Transformation,” aims to advance not only her students’ understanding of aesthetics or music history but also their moral education and their ability to participate in contemporary conversations about race. “I’m very conscious that this is my first time teaching this course after Ferguson,” she says, referring to the 2014 shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. “We’re responding to a new movement, and I very much want to encourage students to engage in this conversation.”
Like Monson’s, Vijay Iyer’s courses, most of which focus on improvisatory or creative music, represent a significant departure from some of the Music Department’s more traditional composition and performance courses centered on chamber music. Though Iyer’s new approach might seem mostly a matter of formal innovation, the professor himself emphasizes his involvement with questions of race and inclusion. “[Improvisation is] something that has no value—literally—in the economy of Western art music. Improvisations are not fixed and therefore cannot accrue royalties,” he says. “It’s only compositions that are valued in the economy of how works circulate. [Improvisation] also happens, not coincidentally, to be a central feature of African American music.”
Yosvany Terry’s presence on the Music faculty itself reflects the department’s interest in further incorporating jazz and non-Western music into its course offerings. Previously, the director of the Harvard jazz bands worked solely for the Office for the Arts; Terry is the first to hold a dual appointment in the office and the Music Department.
Terry says that he also sees his work with students in socially conscious terms. The first course he taught at Harvard was this fall’s “Foundations of Modern Jazz: West African Traditions.” “Within the subject we were dealing with—the question of West African influences in jazz—we were talking about race, we were talking about the historical and social contexts in which this music was developed,” he says. “It’s something that really resonates today…. It was a subject that [most of my students had] never studied before, and it was obvious that they didn’t have a lot of references for Africa.”
He adds that his courses require open-mindedness about cultural difference from his students. He asks students to dance in order to understand West African rhythm patterns, to embody rather than study these musical traditions. “This class was really different for them, because the way that I shape it, and the perspective that I’m hoping to bring to them, is a whole different perspective from the Western European approach to learning,” he says. “They’re learning an oral tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation, through apprenticeships. Those values, the values of the community, have only been preserved in this form; they haven’t been archived in any Western European way.”
George C. Ko ’16, a music concentrator who took Terry’s course this fall, says that the class expanded his perspective on music. “You think of hip-hop music—we love hip-hop because there are so many beats, there are so many rhythms to it, and it’s from this [West African] culture,” he says. “Had I not gone through that experience dancing and chanting and then composing music for that style, I don’t know if I would [be as open] to that kind of music in the future.”
The presence of these scholars on the faculty helped prompt the Music Department to begin reviewing its curriculum in fall 2015, with an eye toward restructuring its concentration requirements. Alexander Rehding, a professor in the department and one of the chairs of the curricular review committee, says that the department’s traditional focus on the Western canon has been extensively discussed among the faculty during the review process. “We are thinking very carefully about the things that we are not teaching as well as the things that we are teaching,” he says. “The way we ended up phrasing our goals is that we realized that we cannot have comprehensive coverage of the musical repertoire, but what we aim for is better coverage.”
Rehding adds that the review process has also been informed by developments outside the walls of Paine Hall. “It really feels like this is part of a discussion that is being had all over the country right now,” he says, speaking of the Black Lives Matter movement and related conversations about race on college campuses.
Terry expresses similar sentiments. “What I’ve seen… is that this conversation [about race on campus] is one that’s been in the department. It’s been in all the committee meetings and all the faculty meetings,” he says. “It’s at the center of what the department wants to do and wants to embrace.”
Rehding specifically highlights a December 2015 protest by Oberlin College’s Black Student Union, which demanded, among other things, an end to what the organization called the privileging of the Western classical repertoire and the underrepresentation of jazz in Oberlin Conservatory. However, at Harvard the push for change has come much more from the music faculty than from students themselves.
Many Music concentrators say that they remain ambivalent about the value of adding more ethnomusicology courses focused on world music. “I could go for more of a diversity of coursework, in the sense that the courses are very focused on Western classical music,” Samantha K. Heinle ’16, a concentrator in music and comparative literature, says. However, she adds that as a joint concentrator she herself was not required to—and did not—take any ethnomusicology courses.
Corcoran says that he supported the department’s efforts at making its curriculum more flexible. “I certainly see [diversity] as something that music departments should be mindful of,” he says. He added, however, that his own work focuses on Wagner and other German Romantic composers. “The department sort of channels right to that, which works out for me,” he says.
Ko says that he believes the department already has a sufficient number of world music courses. “In terms of learning theory, like the basics of music, it’s very Western European-centric… [but] after you take those basic theory courses, there are actually very few Western classical music courses offered,” he says. He added that he would prefer to see more electives focused on Beethoven, Brahms, and other classical composers rather than more ethnomusicology courses.
Josh W. Bean ’16, a joint concentrator in music and East Asian studies, says that he supports the department’s push for diversity. However, he adds that he believes that diversity involves more than simply adding more ethnomusicology courses. “I believe the department should absolutely offer more courses on topics outside the Western classical tradition,” he wrote in an email. “However, the notion that there is this strict dichotomy between Western classical music and ‘other music’ should also be challenged and scrutinized more rigorously in the classroom.” Several other concentrators says that they had no opinion about whether the department should be more inclusive of music outside of the Western tradition.
Moreover, despite the Music Department’s interest in broadening its focus, the study of African American music continues to take place in “[A] significant part outside the department. Regarding contemporary African American music, Monson says. “Getting popular musics and hip-hop into music curricula has been… complicated. Many people who have been interested in those issues have been in American Studies or African American Studies or English departments.” The study of hip-hop at Harvard, for instance, began with the research not of a musicologist but of a linguistic anthropologist, Professor Marcyliena Morgan of the Department of African and African American Studies. Morgan is now executive director of the Hiphop Archive and Research Institute, a collection of recordings, album covers, posters, videos, and other ephemera housed in the Hutchins Center for African and African American Studies. Her own background exemplifies how hip-hop is now understood in an academic context at Harvard: She tends to discuss hip-hop in terms of social critique and political statement rather than musical form.
Still, the presence of the archive at Harvard reflects a significant change in hip-hop’s reception since its birth in the 1970s. “The status quo was always, ‘This isn’t real, this isn’t happening. Nothing significant is coming out of communities of color,’” Morgan says.
“Thinking back to the beginning of hip-hop, you would have thought that all that creativity was criminal, if you listened to the way that society talked about it.”
Harvard’s institutional support has also in itself raised hip-hop to greater prominence in the academic world, according to Morgan. “Harvard has really helped the growth of hip-hop in education, because people can say, ‘Look, they’re doing it at Harvard.’ When I started the archive, I was thinking about it from the perspective of research. I wasn’t thinking about it as a symbol… but that’s what it’s become,” Morgan says.
Even the incorporation of jazz into the Music Department is relatively recent. According to Monson, few university music programs offered any depth of coursework in jazz until the 1990s. Iyer, who majored in physics as an undergraduate at Yale, says that his choice partly reflected the narrow focus of the school’s music department at the time. “If I, as a student, had had access to [Harvard’s] Music Department today, [with faculty] who are thinking about music outside of the Western canon or who have a critical perspective on the Western canon, who are thinking of the music of the African diaspora or other diasporas outside the West and thinking about music from the standpoint of community… then maybe I would have become a music major,” he says.
However, Morgan and other Harvard faculty see the presentation of African American music in the context of African American Studies as in some ways productive, as opposed to suggestive of exclusion. Morgan emphasized hip-hop’s roots in African American communities in the Bronx and elsewhere. Vera Grant, director of the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery of African and African American Art at the Hutchins Center, recently collaborated with faculty in the History of Art and Architecture Department on an exhibition focused on “The Art of Jazz.” “How jazz came about as an art form comes from the African American experience in the United States, so it’s a wonderful interface to have the exhibition here at the Cooper Gallery,” Grant says. “Having the Hutchins Center and then a gallery of African and African American art gives a presence to this marginalized identity to flourish and to be nurtured by art.”

Faculty within the Music Department also emphasize the need to maintain consciousness of music’s origins, of its primary connection to the people and communities that create it. Iyer stresses the idea of music perception as embodied, as an empathetic experience. To hear music, he says, is to acknowledge the presence of another body in one’s own space. “The perception of music is about hearing bodies doing things,” he says. To lose a sense of the particular identities of the bodies that make music is to lose an important aspect of the musical experience, he adds.
Whether and how African American music and other music outside of the Western classical tradition will eventually form a more integral part of the department’s core curriculum remain unresolved questions. And as faculty and students across campus seek the delicate balance between assimilating non-Western music into the curriculum and respecting cultural differences, weigh the costs and benefits of an education based on the classical canon, and debate what knowledge and perspectives undergraduates should gain from a degree in music, the larger question of what it means—or will mean—to study music at Harvard remains an open one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kal Marks, one of Boston’s finest and hardest-working bands, released their third album this past Friday (2/19), on the Exploding in Sound record label. Kal Marks, composed of Alex Audette, Michael Geacone, and Carl Shane, perform dense, thorny guitar-drum-bass rock with existential lyrics. But don’t mistake them for somber rockers—they have a finely wrought sense of the absurd, in every sense of the word, and their work is marked by a deep, wry wit and a sharply ironic outlook (just check their album titles, from their 2014 “Just A Lonely Fart” EP to their just released “Life Is Alright, Everybody Dies” LP). In advance of the album release, The Crimson had the chance to talk with frontman Carl Shane about the new album, their upcoming tour, and what precisely it means to be in an indie band.
The Harvard Crimson: What excites you most about the new album?
Carl Shane: We’re all really proud of this new record. I think we kind of tried to branch out more. I know that’s such a cliché answer .… But I think there’s a lot more diversity to this record than the last one .… Overall it’s really heavy and pretty brutal. But there are just more sounds involved—more spending time with our own instruments as well as adding some synthetic sounds, some keyboard sounds, some electronics, and some different texturing.
THC: You’ve mentioned perseverance as being a really important theme in your album.
CS: The last record was so pessimistic …. I needed something kind of new, subject-wise, to talk about. It’s similar in that the last record was called “Life is Murder,” and this record is called “Life is Alright, Everybody Dies,” so we’re talking about real, scary, fearful things .… A year or so ago, when I started writing some of the first songs on this record, I was just so depressed and I wouldn’t get out of bed .… It wasn’t even like things were that terrible. I just couldn’t bring myself to believe there was anything good to do. And I think that there’s a point when you hit a real low that you say to yourself that anything would be better than this. Feeling anything—even anger—would be better than feeling empty and down. So some of the record is extremely, extremely angry, but it’s motivated and thoughtful .… There are a lot of things that aggravate me .… Just thinking about the planet itself, just feeling like we’re just destroying our world completely, with fossil fuels and war and bigotry and hatred, and it just weighed really heavily on my mind as well as my own personal crap, and I just figured why not yell about it instead of retreat .… [The album] is about trying to be constructive with the reality that things are really messed up. Because you can’t just—I mean you can, but you can’t just submit .… There’s still a tomorrow, and you are going to have to live that tomorrow, and why not try to be constructive and try not to make it so miserable? … It’s really hard to be completely miserable and depressed when you are making yourself useful. I actually learned that from one of my biggest heroes, Louis C.K. He said that in an interview and it just immediately—it changed everything. I have so much respect for his stand-up material, but I just think he’s an amazing thinker. And he talks about things that everybody goes through .… My mom is a nurse, and she works in an old folks’ home and probably sees so many people die all the time. I think to myself that I would be so depressed, but my mom’s not a depressed person .…  It’s because when somebody dies, she just has to go on and keep on treating the next patient. I don’t know if that sounds cold, but it’s the truth. You can’t just stop the world. People are still sick. People still need help. And you’ve got to be useful. And she’s my hero in my mind .… Hearing things like that just make me want to do better things with my life and make music that’s not so self-centered and more trying to relate to others.
THC: Do you feel that in a way, making music itself is a way of persevering?
CS: Absolutely. Some people think that music is so heartbreaking .… I think some people find music to be heartbreaking, and they give up on it because they are expecting something out of it. And you can’t expect anything. I mean, I want the best for us, I really do, and when people come to us and want to talk to us or want to buy a record or whatever or have us play a show, it’s so great:I’m so grateful for all of that. But I can’t expect that at all. The only expectations you should have is for yourself—to make music that you want to make and to push your creativity. You can’t be just sitting around thinking, “When is somebody going to discover me?” I know I probably felt like that in the past when I was younger, but now I’ve just kind of grown old, and I don’t care anymore about fulfilling anybody’s expectations or their requirements. Music—you really do it for yourself first, and then you do it for other people as well. I really do want to entertain people. When I see people have a smile on their face when we are playing or something like that, it feels really good. And it makes me want to play even better. It feels good to give people something that you cherish. I cherish what we do, the three of us, and I want to share it with people. But I’m not ever going to be like, “Yeah, tonight in St. Louis there should be a bunch of people, there has to be.” There doesn’t have to be. It really has to be for you first and foremost. And yeah, it is a good way of persevering and getting through life. I mean, our music is so loud and so emotional but also primal, in a way, that you just get a lot of aggression out and a lot of emotion out at the same time. It’s got a really caveman kind of quality, but there are a lot of cerebral things to it as well that just lend to your animal, dumb aggression as well as your emotional pain, to just release.
THC: How has performing the new material been?
CS: I think that people are going to like the music more live than on record, though I could be wrong. When we perform, even if there’s a really small crowd, at least one person will come away with it saying, “Hey, that was impressive!” It has picked up a little bit in areas where we never expected it before, where we will play a show and will be greatly received—or well-received by our standards—because we’ve been a band for years to little attention. We’re still a very, very small band. We’re not unwelcoming of more people hearing us. We totally are happy to play to new people every single time, but again, we don’t expect that .… I totally understand wanting to be loved or appreciated, but we just do it either way. Pardon my language, but we just don’t give a f--- about getting a sweet record deal or playing some really big venue. If anything, we want to play the music we want to make and share it with people that would enjoy it and want an intimate kind of moment with us. We’re not shying away from ever playing big venues, but that’s not priority one at all. If that happens, we’ll try to figure out if this is something we can do, but we might be forgotten tomorrow .… That’s the way things are. I can’t have any foresight into knowing that this is going to ever mean anything to anybody.I can’t. So just do it for yourself for the time being. We really have a ball playing! … As much as we try to do what we do as an art or some kind of really creative project, I think when we play to people, we somewhat divorce ourselves from it a little bit and realize that this is entertainment, to give people a good time .… Music is exciting; it’s always going to be exciting. Especially when it’s loud and present and everybody’s locked in. It’s fun for us, and if it’s fun for the people watching, it makes it even better for us and makes us want to go even further.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I arrived in Cambridge last August a wide-eyed freshman from a beach town in southern California. I had a distinct style. It was half anti-establishment and half The Weeknd wannabe. I wore, and still predominately wear, minimal color. In fact, in the first week of college, my roommate told me my closet looked like that of a cartoon character because it was literally all white, gray, or black t-shirts. Same style choices go for my shoes, jackets, and sweatshirts. I do get a little crazy with my socks, but that’s about it.
At first, I found what east coasters wore to be comical. I chuckled when I saw my buddy show up to class in white loafers, blue shorts with pink whales on them, a white Lacoste belt, and a pink Lacoste button-down. But when winter hit, I was not prepared to deal with the preponderance of L.L. Bean Boots on my classmates’ feet.
To me, these are the ugliest shoes ever to be mass-manufactured. I was in shock when I realized people were not wearing these as an ironic statement, but actually paid a lot of money to wear glorified clogs. Anyone who wants to argue that the L.L. Bean Boot is aesthetically pleasing can contact me via email, because I am yet to find anything pleasant about the boot. The craziest aspect about the boot is that it is so universally worn. Whether you are from Alabama or Alaska, there is a 50 percent chance that, if you go to Harvard, you wear Bean boots.
I sincerely doubt that the population of Bean boot wearers at Harvard walked into a store and happened to pick out the Bean boot for its aesthetic appeal. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure there is a contingency of Harvard students who genuinely gravitated toward these boots, but I’m also sure a sizeable amount of students went and purchased them because they're a mainstay on Ivy League campuses.
There is almost an implicit promise on the tag of Bean Boots: “If you buy us, all your Ivy League friends will think you fit in.” The boots do not lie either, as purchasing them lets everyone in the Harvard bubble know that you adhere to a certain set of confines and rules. Buying ugly shoes to fit in is no different than any other form of buying friends, like joining a final club or laughing at jokes you don’t find funny. It is just a more visible method.
But as I try to make sense of my disdain for Bean boots, I’m realizing that there is a paradox with fashion as self-expression. Clothes serve as a means to project our identity to the world; they are an extension of our personalities. It is a way to tell the world, “This is me!” without ever moving your lips. And yet, time and time again, we see people buying the same clothes as their peers. So self-expression morphs into nothing more than thoughtless conformity. But this is too simple to be the entirety of the scenario. And as much as I may want to, I refuse to fully believe my own pessimism.
When I came to college, I never thought I’d become friends with my roommate. His demeanor, mindset, and style are the polar opposite to mine. He is Biggie and I am Tupac. He is country music and I am trap music. He is Nantucket reds and pink polos, and I am Stan Smiths and gray T-shirts. I thought he was the lamest-dressed kid I’ve met, and now, I find myself marveling at the ingenuity of his outfits. At a formal event we both attended, he rocked the Nantucket reds with a sock tie, and I realized the error in my thinking.
I’ve realized that it’s arrogant of me to believe that I have the final word on self-expression. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and regardless of how certain I am that my opinion is correct, it is actually irrelevant. Irrelevant because fashion, appearance, and perception are so culturally rooted that I can’t make a fair analysis of anyone. Irrelevant because clothes do not make the man.
My attack on Bean boots may be legitimate, but it is not righteous. We all want acceptance; I should not knock people for trying to get it. Actually, I sometimes wish I could be more blatant in my search for acceptance. With time, my tastes have changed, so who’s to say others’ tastes are worse because they are different than my own? Although I doubt it, maybe one day I’ll wake up and believe that Bean boots are actually the best boot on the market. Hell, maybe one day my closet will be filled up with vibrant colors like my roommate’s. Right now, as I open up my closet, I still see predominately minimalistic colors, but if I look close enough, I can see the Nantucket Reds I got for Christmas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, I was one of the lucky students who got to see Conan O’Brien '85 in conversation with University President Drew G. Faust, a shining example of one of the many visits Harvard receives each semester from those graduates who it deems successful.
O’Brien discussed his thoughts on the illusion of success. He claimed that he is not the final product of a successful career (despite his late-night fame), reminiscing about the days when he sat where I was sitting, in Sanders Theatre watching a well-known alumnus, and wondering how that person had figured it all out; and perhaps most importantly, he pushed back against the notion of ever having it all figured out.
Through the jokes, tidbits of wisdom, and the student questions that followed the conversation, I took O’Brien’s sentiments to heart and found myself wondering why I had even come to see this event. Why do I (and a larger "we" at the College) contribute to the idea of celebrity and idolize the concept of "success" to the point where we lottery to view those who have achieved it? At a school that is esteemed as a place for successful students to learn from successful faculty—a school that spurs success, that bleeds success—it often feels as though there is immense pressure for us to want to be "successful" and to want it unquestioningly, blindly following those who came before us.
This all, of course, depends on our definition of success. Maybe it means stability, happiness, and freedom. Maybe it’s a self-fulfilling construct—we believe we are successful, and therefore are. Maybe "success" is being confident enough to sit back like O’Brien, and suggest that success is a never-ending project.
The scariest prospect is that our definition of success somehow hinges on our being students at Harvard. Too often the Harvard name passes as an indicator of "success," allowing people with its mark to sneak to the top of every pile—hedge fund managers, Supreme Court nominees, the short list for CEOs, first picks for tenure. If we create a societal hierarchy led only by those who come with the Harvard stamp, is that a society we want to live in?
If we draw a causal link between Harvard and "success" we create a wrong, and potentially dangerous, value. "Success" and what we make of it must not rely on that privilege; an institutional label should not impact our idea of what such a grand concept is, and what it can be. We must watch out for how our own actions might play into that pattern. Wouldn’t we prefer our definition of "success" to come from our own standards rather than those of a 380-year-old university with a highly imperfect history?
Moreover, the definition of "success" seems to change with age (I could spell the word “discombobulated” in first grade, but no one pats me on the back for that now), with location, and with prestige. Which is why I find the notion of success—as a predictable ladder, constructed of particular achievements, each judged by a preexisting standard—to be invalid. If we measure our time here, in this one place and at this one time, in terms of "success," we will likely feel unfulfilled upon exit. We can chase success, but will never truly catch up.
Many of us likely felt that our greatest moment of "success" to date was admission to Harvard—the event that leads the way for us to become "Harvard grads." It is a process in which we have little choice, in which there is great randomness, and one that often lacks complete integrity given the injustices of a system in which legacies, donations, and educational inequalities play a part. But everything after admission is (hopefully) a choice: the classes we take, the jobs we find, and the people we pull in to or edge out of our lives. Perhaps the biggest choice we must make is what success means to us, and if "success" is even an idea we want to subscribe to.
Despite all our other choices, our standards for success manage to remain rather stagnant during college. A success story is all too often still defined as one with name recognition, usually with wealth, and often with a Harvard degree. To idolize the "successful" Harvard graduates who come back to have conversations with President Faust on the Sanders Theatre stage is to buy into a narrow idea of what achievement means and to diminish the achievements of those on different paths.
I don’t mean to suggest that we should never lottery for opportunities to see entertaining alumni, but we do need to question why we want to see them; to wonder if we think they are more successful simply for having graduated from here; and especially, to create our own definition of success, or—better yet—nix the term and its connotations altogether.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the worrying sexual conduct climate survey results were revealed in the fall, Harvard has seen a concerted push across campus to combat the issue. Recently, the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee furthered this effort by passing legislation that will require a majority of the executive board members of each student group receiving significant grant money from the UC to participate in sexual assault prevention training provided by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators.
The trainings will be required for organizations receiving funding totals within the top 20 percent of the UC's allocations. This figure translates to approximately $1,000 per group; of the 278 groups that requested funding last year, 58 received more than $1,000. 
We commend the Finance Committee for this step towards making Harvard’s campus a safer place. The College’s largest student organizations—from club sports to cultural groups to pre-professional organizations—reach nearly all ends of campus. Training these groups’ student leaders on how to prevent and, if necessary, intervene in situations with threats of sexual assault will thus have a far-reaching effect. This also marks an important step toward transforming the campus culture that revolves around the stigmatized issue of sexual assault.
Of course, the legislation’s amendment that will exempt student organizations with individual strategic partnerships with OSAPR and those students who are on multiple executive boards and have already fulfilled the requirement once make sense. In an environment of limited resources, practicality is a must.
That said, we urge the Finance Committee to be wary of the clause that will waive the training for the student groups for whom OSAPR and CARE trainings “cannot be conducted in a logistically feasible manner.” If the resources to provide training for the majority of executive board members are lacking, then the UC should lower each student organization’s attendance threshold to ensure that all pertinent student organizations have at least one representative present. While training at least half of the executive boards of each student organization receiving significant UC funding would be ideal, we believe it is more important to make sure that more organizations are covered by the training before focusing on the fraction of board members who are trained.
In that same vein, the UC should explore the possibility of extending the mandate to all student groups. Though the current legislation already applies to more than 50 student groups, the statistics about sexual assault on campus are simply too dire to be ignored. 
If the lack of resources becomes an impediment to this initiative, we hope the UC will push the University to further expand resources for both OSAPR and CARE in order to sufficiently fulfill this need. These two organizations were created for precisely these purposes. They should be able to operate and better our campus to their full capacities. The UC's new training requirement is a fantastic first step toward this goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Latino Studies Working Group hosted its inaugural event on Monday afternoon, and discussed the group’s goals of bringing together Latino studies scholars across Harvard.
Attendees expressed interest in creating a space for members to present scholarly work and receive feedback, implementing a mentorship system, and creating social opportunities for members. The group also discussed speakers they would like to bring to the University.
While most of the discussion focused around community-building and academic support, Lawrence M. La-Fountain Stokes ’90, director of the University of Michigan’s Latino studies program, suggested the group approach the administration about hiring more Latino Studies faculty members, and take action to increase Latino studies scholarship at Harvard.
“Harvard can not continue to not be a university that’s in the 21st century,” La-Fountain Stokes said.
The formation of the group comes on the heels of a new secondary field  in Latino Studies and the formation of a working group in Asian American studies, both affiliated with the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights. The working group is also affiliated with the EMR committee.
La-Fountain Stokes shared research from his upcoming book about Puerto Rican drag queens. Following the lecture, the working group combined dinner with a discussion of the group’s plans and purposes.
According to Mayra R. Rivera, a Divinity School professor who is the working group’s faculty director and a member of the EMR committee, the group will provide a space for intellectual community among scholars of Latino studies at the College and beyond.
“The EMR [program] services the undergraduate population. We know there are students in other schools who are interested in Latino Studies, or students who haven’t decided if they want to do a secondary,” Rivera said.
Although Rivera predicted overlap between students working towards a secondary in Latino Studies and group participants, the group is not limited only to those pursuing a secondary. Rivera said she will serve as a facilitator, but the group will be mainly student-led.
“When we meet, we want to take into consideration the expressed needs of the students,” Christofer A. Rodelo, a graduate student in American Studies who serves as the group’s student coordinator, said.  “The group is what the students want it to be.”
Tessa L. Desmond, administrative director of EMR, said the idea for working groups formed after a graduate student who wanted to get involved in EMR approached her.
“The Latino Studies Working Group is meant to be an intergenerational space where students can come together and define their interests and what they want to see,” she said.
Delany D. Sisiruca ’16, a Government concentrator who focuses on Latin America, said she attended the event because she is taking a class with Rivera on Caribbean poetics. She said a lack of Latino Studies course offerings at Harvard has posed a challenge to her academic studies and added that she sees the working group as forming a “makeshift department” in lieu of an official one.
At the dinner and discussion, attendees hailed from multiple graduate schools and the College. There were also two attendees from Brown and one from MIT. La-Fontaine Stokes stayed to talk over Cuban food.

Rushing to turn in pass/fail forms to the Registrar’s Office on Monday before the 5 p.m. deadline, students came and went from the fourth floor of the Smith Campus Center, which hummed with activity.
Monday, the start of the 5th week of the spring semester, marked the final day students could switch their grading preferences from letter graded to pass/fail or vice versa. It was also the last day students could choose to add or drop courses from their schedules.
Students offered a variety of reasons for waiting until the very end of the period to change their grading preferences. Joseph G. Lanzillo ’16 offered no contrived excuse.
“I’m indecisive,” Lanzillo said. “I don’t have a good reason.”
Others, however, said they were strategic in their waiting until just before the deadline to switch to pass/fail. Ricky Li ’19 said he waited until the last chance to determine whether he could balance his coursework with his new responsibilities in the Harvard Financial Analysts Club.
“I needed two weeks to test if I can actually handle this schedule, and after two weeks, right before the deadline, I feel like I cannot handle this schedule anymore,” Li said.
You-Myeong Kim ’17 said he used the extra time to his advantage, in his case, to determine whether he could handle the rigors of a class for which he did not meet some of the prerequisites.  He will now take his course pass/fail as well.
“I just wanted to see how the material was until I made the decision,” Kim said. “I waited until the last possible moment to see.”
Some students who were adding and dropping classes also said they waited in order to use the add/drop period as a kind of extended shopping week.
“I didn’t think shopping week was enough to decide which classes I wanted to take,” Henry J. Kline ’19, who dropped one of his classes, said. “I couldn’t really get a good sense of a lot of the classes I was shopping, so I picked my top five… [and] figured out what the work was going to be like.”
Both adding and dropping courses and switching grading preferences require consultation with one’s academic adviser. For  Raylin F. Xu ’19, who waited until the early hours of Monday morning to begin the process of dropping a course, having an understanding adviser was a must.
“I texted my adviser at like 4:45 this morning to tell her I wanted to drop,” Xu said. The adviser, she said, responded at 6 a.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The founders and namesakes of ice cream company Ben and Jerry’s came to Cambridge to rally undergraduate supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign in anticipation of the Massachusetts primary election next week.
The event, held in a back room of Central Square’s Middle East restaurant and nightclub, began with around 100 students and young voters chanting the signature phrase of Sanders’ campaign, “Feel the Bern,” as the two founders took the stage to talk about their support for the Vermont senator.
Students from Harvard Students for Bernie were among those present.
“Ben and I are all in for Bernie,” said Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of the Vermont-based ice cream company. “Everywhere we go, people are so psyched to support Bernie.”
The crowd went wild as fellow co-founder Bennett “Ben” Cohen waved a lit-up purple LED campaign sign behind Greenfield.
“Bernie is the first presidential candidate that Ben and I have ever actively worked for,” Greenfield said. “He is incredible. He is a candidate that comes once in a generation.”
Cohen and Greenfield, who have both been constituents of Sanders for more than 30 years, praised the senator for his commitment to values that resonated with them.
“He has been tireless and unwavering in his work for students, for everyday working Americans, for veterans, for seniors. He has never let us down because Bernie Sanders is not for sale,” Greenfield said.
Cohen described Sanders’s platform advocating for universal health care and raising the minimum wage.
“For Bernie, the words fairness, justice, and equality are not just empty words,” Cohen said.
This event just after members of Harvard Students for Bernie continued to canvass this weekend near Harvard Square. Over the past few weeks, the group has made thousands of calls to several early primary states, according to Justin G. Curtis ’19, vice president of Harvard Students for Bernie.
“Ben and Jerry are pretty famous within the Bernie campaign. We’re just trying to mobilize support on Harvard’s campus. Events like these are perfect; we got 10 to 15 people to show up,” Curtis said.
Recent polls show former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton with a small lead over Sanders the week before the Massachusetts primary, which will take place alongside primaries and caucuses in 12 other states on March 1, known as “Super Tuesday.” Of Harvard faculty members who contributed to campaigns in 2015, the vast majority donated to Clinton.
Students said they were confident, though, about Sanders’ ability to perform in the Bay State and other states next week.
“We’re feeling pretty good going into Massachusetts. It looks like we’re going to take some victories over the next few weeks,” Archie I. H. Stonehill ’17, a member of Harvard Students for Bernie, said.
The rally concluded with distribution of the free ice cream donated by Cohen and Greenfield for the event.

With sharp criticism towards the Harvard administration, the Cambridge City Council reaffirmed its support of the graduate student unionization effort in a resolution that passed unanimously late Monday evening.
The City Council claims in its resolution that Harvard administrators are interfering with the graduate student unionization effort. The resolution is sponsored by City Councillor Leland Cheung and expresses the Council’s “strong support” for the effort to gain collective bargaining rights for graduate students at Harvard. 
“We’re glad to see that students, junior faculty, research assistants, and teaching assistants are coming together and organizing to have a stronger voice within the administration,” Cheung said.
Ann Hall, a spokesperson for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, declined to comment before the Council passed its resolution.
This resolution, proposed by the newly elected City Council, follows a November resolution unanimously passed by the previous Council, which supported the efforts of Harvard’s graduate student unionization movement, named the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers.
Cristina V. Groeger ’08, a graduate student in the History Department and an organizer for the unionization movement, addressed the Council on behalf of the HGSU-UAW at the November meeting.
“We hope to get the administration to recognize that workers having a voice is a good thing and that they should let the workers decide without threats, intimidation, and misinformation,” Groeger said at that meeting.
Groeger specifically mentioned a memo circulated by GSAS administrators to the deans and top administrators of Harvard’s schools.
The memo advised faculty members against threatening students who support the unionization effort, interrogating students about union membership, promising favors for students who stand against the effort, or carrying out various other anti-union actions.
The memo also states faculty members should “explain the disadvantages of union membership” and “stress the importance of the academic relationship between faculty members and students.”
Groeger pointed to these subpoints as examples of how the administration “is trying to sway the outcome of what really should be a democratic decision among grad students.”
Cheung said he hoped the resolution would push the Harvard administration to accept the unionization efforts, despite the University’s opposition.
“I think the administration should be welcoming it,” Cheung said. “I think they should not see this as a fight between a group of people who work for the University and the University itself. It should be both sides.”
“I mean, we’re very happy that the Cambridge City Council decided to endorse the effort,” graduate student union organizer and HGSU-UAW spokesperson John M. Nicoludis said. “It really shows that the Cambridge community supports grad workers.”
Based on current legal precedent, private universities can refuse to recognize graduate student unions, even if graduate students vote to form one. The National Labor Relations Board ruled in 2004 that graduate students are primarily students and that any work they do is part of their degree program. However, the current NLRB, with its more liberal composition, could view graduate student unionization more favorably.
This is not the first time the Cambridge City Council has fought with Harvard over unionization efforts. Councillors worked alongside employees at the Harvard-owned, Boston-Cambridge DoubleTree Hotel in their efforts to collectively bargain. The hotel’s employees were allowed to unionize last April.
In general, union organizers often look to politicians at the local and state level for support. For example, Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy voiced his support for the graduate student unionization movement at Yale.
“We’re trying to get as much political and community support as possible, so we’re definitely still working on increasing that support,” Groeger said.

In 1936, with Harvard’s tercentenary celebration approaching, former English professor Pierre de Chaignon la Rose, Class of 1895, set out to design seals for each of Harvard’s graduate schools.
For Harvard Law School, he drew a blue shield adorned with three sheaves of wheat—the family crest of Isaac Royall, Jr., an 18th-century slaveholder whose gift to Harvard had endowed the school’s first law professorship. The Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, then adopted La Rose’s design, more than a century after the Law School was founded.
After re-examining the seal’s history roughly 80 years later, a Law School committee will likely decide this week whether to recommend changing the school’s shield. After weeks of reviewing documents detailing the seal’s origins and speaking to Law School affiliates, the committee—composed of students, faculty, staff, and alumni—will release its full report in March to the Corporation, which holds final decision-making authority.
Last fall, a wave of activism about race relations at the Law School drew attention to the seal’s connection to slavery, as members of the student group Royall Must Fall called for the seal’s removal. Student activists at universities across the globe have challenged historical symbols, prompting debate about whether the removal of such symbols constitutes erasing history.
“The report that we make to the Corporation will be very detailed,” Bruce H. Mann, chair of the committee reviewing the seal, said. “It will include what we know about Isaac Royall, it will include the origins of the shield, the circumstances in which it was adopted, because all of those really are relevant factors in what should be done with the shield going forward.”
In late November, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow created the committee and appointed Law professor and legal historian Mann as its chair. Minow also appointed faculty members Janet E. Halley, Tomiko Brown-Nagin, Annette Gordon-Reed, and Samuel Moyn, as well as alumni James E. Bowers and Robert J. Katz.
Additionally, a Law School staff council appointed staff members Darrick Northington and Yih-Hsien Shen to the committee in January, and the student government chose student members of the committee through a written application process. Mawuse H. Barker-Vormawor, one of the founding members of Royall Must Fall; Rena T. Karefa-Johnson, a member of Reclaim Harvard Law, another activist group calling for the seal’s removal; and Ann C.E. Rittgers are the students who serve on the committee.
Mann said the committee is different than others at the Law School because it consists of students, alumni, and staff in addition to faculty, who generally comprise the other school committees.
“The mere composition of the committee signals that this is something the Law School is trying to approach in as open and inclusive and transparent a way as possible,” Mann said.
Bianca S. Tylek, a Law School student activist, said that based on the committee members’ backgrounds, the group seems favorable to changing the seal. The committee includes activists and legal historians who study civil rights and race in America.
“I think we have a pretty good feeling about the shield changing,” Tylek said.
The committee has studied the seal for more than a month and held a series of community meetings to discuss changing the seal. But the committee has only met as a full  group once, and Mann said members have not yet shared their personal views on the issue with the group. Committee members emphasized the importance of considering a variety of viewpoints and engaging different constituencies within the Law School.
“I think that it’s a useful process in the way that it allows for us to have a conversation that was missing when the crest was adopted,” Vormawor said.
The committee will meet this week to deliberate, and Mann said he hopes they will settle on a position during that meeting. Soon after making their decision, the group will prepare a report it will likely present to the Corporation in early March.
“I have every confidence that the Corporation will be very receptive to whatever we might recommend,” Mann said.

At a time when Harvard finds itself debating the ways controversial history is remembered on campus, Caribbean historian Hilary M. Beckles told a Harvard Law School audience the best way to deal with a thorny past is confronting it head on.

“There’s no point in burying the legacy and memories,” Beckles said. “Let us bring everything to the surface and find a way forward through all of this.”
Beckles was the keynote speaker at a panel discussion on reparatory justice for Caribbean countries that facilitated the slave trade, and was joined by other Harvard professors on the panel in the Law School’s Ames courtroom.
The Caribbean played an integral role in the international slave trade during the 18th and 19th centuries, and Beckles said “the West will be on trial” until it amends for the role its former colonies played in facilitating slavery.
As chairman of the Caribbean Community Reparations Committee, founded by Caribbean national governments in 2013 to establish a case for reparations to nations in the region, Beckles referenced a 10-point plan he has developed alongside a commission of inquiry to best “formulate a strategy for reparative justice to move the society forward.”
“Reparative justice is not about black people standing on the street corners expecting charities from white folks,” Beckles said. “This is about building of bridges across lines of moral justice.”
He called on Western world leaders to atone for their countries’ wrongdoing by investing in housing, education, healthcare, social justice, and infrastructure development in the Caribbean countries.
Specifically, Beckles urged United States President Barack Obama to use his global influence to push the world towards increased reparative justice. He added that he hoped the next time he is invited to the Law School, it would be for the opening ceremony of an “Obama Center for Reparative Justice.”
As of Monday, Law School activists were a week into their occupation of the Caspersen Student Center lounge as they called for increased resources devoted to minority students and a change in the school’s seal, which was adopted from the slaveholding Royall family's crest.
While he did not delve deeply into the current protests at the Law School, Beckles encouraged young people to ensure they are learning in ethical environments.
Alexander J. Clayborne, a third-year Law School student who has helped organize protests, attended the event and said he found the talk “powerful,” especially as it pertained to both global and current events at Harvard.
History professor Sven Beckert, who moderated the event, also linked the talk to current issues at Harvard.
“This is not just a story from long time ago, but a story that is very local and very much about this University as well,” Beckert said.
Professors Annette Gordon Reed, Kenneth W. Mack, and Vincent Brown also participated in the panel.

Though Continuum aims to invigorate North Allston by uniting town and gown, early lease sales at the new residential and retail complex have come in fits and starts, according to local real estate experts.
Continuum has leased almost 40 percent of its residential units as of February 2016, according to Leslie G. Cohen, chief operating officer at Boston-based real estate developer Samuels & Associates. Though Harvard owns the land under Continuum, the University chose Samuels & Associates in 2012 as the developer of the property.
Continuum began leasing its 325 apartments in August of last year. Studios and one-bedroom apartments—the complex’s least expensive and smallest units—are priced upwards of $2,000. Some have expressed concern that renters are being overcharged.
“That’s high,” said Kevin Cleary, a real estate agent for Re/Max in Boston. “Even though you have a lot of amenities [at Continuum], that’s a lot of money.”
According to local rental search company Jumpshell, the average rent in Boston is currently $2,100—roughly $200 less than the starting price for a studio apartment in Continuum.
By October 2015, approximately 23 percent  of Continuum’s units had been leased, according to local real estate blog Curbed Boston. Since then, prices have increased marginally. Samuels has begun offering new renters special incentives, including two rent-free months for tenants who move in by a certain date and a $100 parking discount for the first year, according to Cohen.
Cohen wrote in an emailed statement that Continuum’s leasing progress is “on-track” with Samuels’ projections for the complex.
Cleary said he was “not surprised” that Continuum has an occupancy rate of 40 percent—which he called a “low figure”—given that the building only began leasing in August, late in the rental season. Ideally, Cleary said, apartments “come online” in May or June.
Cleary said he was still taken aback by what he termed Continuum’s lack of progress leasing out retail units. Samuels has yet to name future tenants for the retail space on the ground floor, though Samuels spokesperson Kate Haranis wrote in an emailed statement the company was “close” to some “exciting announcements” on the retail front.
“It doesn’t seem like anything is set in stone,” Cleary said. He added that he looked at a building for a client in Government Center right next to City Hall and that it was priced lower than Continuum’s retail space per square foot.
Continuum features ground-floor retail space and a variety of housing options, including studio, one, two, and three-bedroom apartments. According to Cohen, prospective residents are also drawn by large amenity spaces, a game room, cyber lounge, and “creative green spaces.” After a January lottery, 42 affordable apartments in Continuum were offered to renters, a proportion of units mandated by law.
Harvard's blueprint for development in the neighborhood included Continuum as one of a series of development projects for the intersection of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street, just down the road from the future site of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and other facilities.
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke said Continuum would bring “new vibrancy” and support for businesses in that area.
“The fact that, at least for now, several other developers are moving ahead with project proposals in the neighborhood.” Gerald Autler, a senior project manager at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said. “That to me is a sign that the development community at large still feels like there’s potential here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, freshman Meagan Popp helped the women’s swimming and diving team to its 12th Ivy League championship.  At the meet, she set three school records in the 200 IM, 100 breast, and 200 breast events, resulting in a first, second, and tied for first placement, respectively.  But several other Crimson athletes also had stellar performances this week as well.
Tommy McCarthy, Men's Basketball
After Harvard made an unlikely comeback from a 21-point second half deficit in its game against Cornell, Tommy McCarthy sealed the Crimson victory with a two-pointer with 5.5 seconds remaining.
McCarthy not only sunk the near-buzzer winning shot but also finished the game with a career high of 21 points and eight assists.  His new record eclipsed his former 17-point career high set the night before against Columbia.
 
Hannah Allchurch, Women’s Swimming and Diving
Freshman diver Hannah Allchurch had a stellar performance for the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team at the Ivy League Championships. Allchurch took home the gold in the 3-meter event, breaking the pool record with a score of 334.95 and earning the Crimson 32 points for the meet in the process.
Additionally, Allchurch was one of the six Harvard divers to qualify to compete in the A Final for the 3-meter.  Occupying six of the eight positions in this final and placing well, the divers earned the team a combined total of 153 points with Allchurch spearheading the charge in second place.
Seb Lloyd, Men’s Ice Hockey
After helping the team earn a share of the Ivy League title one-night prior, Seb Lloyd assisted in securing the men’s hockey team a 7-4 victory over Colgate Saturday night.
The British Columbia, Canada native earned two points this game with a pivotal goal at the start of the second period to lead the Crimson offense past the Raiders.
Julia Glynn, Women’s Lacrosse
The Long Island, N.Y. native helped the Crimson to a resounding 16-8 victory in its season-opening away game against Hofstra.
Glynn scored six goals against The Pride on eight shots, marking the most goals for a single player since junior Marissa Romeo tallied the same amount last year against Boston College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into the Ivy League Championship Meet, freshman Meagan Popp had seen her fair amount of high-placing finishes, but she had yet to top the podium as a member of the Harvard women’s swim team. Three days later, Popp’s name has been stamped into the Crimson record books a grand total of three times.
The Newport Beach, Calif., native shattered records across a variety of events—the 200 IM, 100 breaststroke, and as a member of the 800 free team.
But it is not the glory, scoring, nor record breaking that drives Popp.
“We just had fun,” Popp said. “Dancing on the pool deck, singing along to our favorite songs are all things we do every day at practice. And we made it our goal to treat the meet like practice, because we are at our best when we are our usual selves.”
This casual environment certainly worked out for Popp. While the previous top-seven Harvard times in the 200 IM were within 0.7 seconds of each other, Popp’s time of 1:57.94 crushed the record by nearly three seconds.
The freshman’s 100 breast trumped a record set only two years ago by former captain Stephanie Ferrell ’15. Popp completed the race in 1:01.65, edging out Farrell’s record by 0.25 seconds. But despite the historic performance, Popp’s performance garnered only a silver at Ivies.
For her final record of the weekend, Popp’s hand in the 800 free relay saw yet another record fall. The quartet of Popp, junior Daniela Johnson, freshman Sonia Wang, and sophomore Geordie Enoch earned a second-place finish at Ivies, touching the wall in 7:12.78.
Senior Danielle Lee, a Crimson record holder in the 100 and 200 back, and relay teammate of Popp’s, attributed the freshman’s success in the pool to her work ethic.
“She works extremely hard at practice,” Lee said.“She pushes her herself every day at the pool and is always willing to swim on faster intervals.”
Popp’s dominance at the Ancient Eight championship was not only restricted to breaking records. Alongside Lee, Johnson, and senior Kendall Crawford, Harvard’s 3:38.44 finish proved good enough for silver in the 400 medley relay.
A bronze medal was also awarded to Lee, Popp, freshman Brittany Usinger and sophomore Gabby Sims in the 200 medley relay for their time of 1:40.33.
The age diversity in the relay teams reflects the depth of the program, with rookies and veterans alike bringing new talent to the table.
“We recruited an incredible freshman class this year,” Lee said.“The biggest role that the seniors play on the team... is to guide the underclassmen and give them advice, especially since we have already been through four seasons.”
Popp took yet another individual gold in the 200 breast, where she tied for first with a time of 2:12.18.
In addition to the slew of individual and relay record-breaking and podium-topping performances, every one of Popp’s times in individual events at Ivies qualified for the NCAA ‘B’ cut standard.
It is not just the points on the board that qualify this freshman’s value to the team. Popp’s teammates feed off her positive energy.
“You can always count on Meagan to be smiling and having a positive attitude no matter what,” Lee said. “Her happiness is contagious. Meagan’s can-do attitude and ‘Let’s go ladies’ cheer help the team get through tough practices.”
Ultimately, all the success and energy Popp brings to the team is mirrored in the strength she finds in her teammates; swimming is not at all an individual endeavor for Popp.
“Every member of the team kept a level head, and after this weekend, I think we all learned that we are better as a whole than we are individually,” Popp said.
