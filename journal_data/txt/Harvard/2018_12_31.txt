After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I stepped out of Woodley Park Station and into the rain, I regretted forgetting to pack my umbrella that morning. My annoyance only lasted a second, however, as I remembered that I only had a few hours left to live. The steady rain of that morning had now become a heavy downpour mixed with sleet, and I could barely make out the street signs as I dashed across the street. I ran from the station’s exit towards the McDonald’s restaurant next door, bag held above my head for protection, water seeping into my socks with every step that I took.
“Esperanza, your escort has arrived!” the manager Sal, a gruff-looking man with a matted mustache, yelled towards the kitchen as I entered the fast food restaurant. A moment later, my mother made her way out.
“¿Pero cómo estás así de empapado? You’re soaked.”
My mother wiped her hands on her uniform and reached for my bangs, pulling them out of my face and combing my wet hair with her fingers.
“Are you ready to go home?” I asked as I wrinkled my nose in feigned disgust at how she played with my hair.
“I can’t believe how long your hair has gotten,” she replied, ignoring my question. “It’s almost to your shoulders.”
I rolled my eyes playfully and motioned towards the door. As I did so, my mother pulled out a small black umbrella from the backpack slung over her right shoulder, and we made our exit.
***
As a child, I always dreamed of visiting the Swiss Alps. For my twelfth birthday, my mom gave me a copy of “Countries of the World,” a book with a page for every country on Earth. She handed me the book and asked me to pick out the ones we would visit first once we obtained legal status. Tracing the smiles on the faces of the white families skiing down the Alps on the Switzerland page, I couldn’t help but envy their seemingly carefree existences.
Each night as I closed my eyes for bed, I would imagine myself making snow angels on the highest peak of the tallest Alp. Soon, this fantasy would solidify into a vivid dream, and I would find myself sliding down the Alps on invisible skis.
***
I still dream about the Alps today, but the dreams have changed. Suddenly, I’ve come to fear the snow. What once felt refreshing now seems to beckon death. The tourists in the dream have changed too. Their once enviable smiles have turned into sinister, inhuman snarls. Their terrifying gazes have intensified too, as they ski alongside me.
“Why are you staring at me like that?” I call out.
No answer. My skis begin to pick up speed until I am no longer in control. The cool air lashes against my cheeks as I plummet even faster towards the bottom of the Alp. I close my eyes in fear, just as a familiar voice penetrates the alpine air.
“Oh, I didn’t know you meant you were different like that.”
It’s Peter.
“I’m happy you’re breaking up with me. To be honest, I’m not sure why I even dated you.”
I open my eyes and find him skiing down the Alp on my right, snarling at me in disgust.
“Que decepción tan grande.”
I immediately turn to my left to find my mom skiing down with me on the other side, with the same cruel snarl as Peter, the harsh expression distorting her features until they were almost unrecognizable.
“I didn’t do anything wrong. Why are you looking at me like that?”
“Why are you holding that? That’s not for you,” a man’s voice from behind calls.
I look down at my hands and notice that I have been holding one of the Lego dolls that I used to make as a child. I quickly throw it into the snow as my heart begins to beat faster.
“It’s not mine. I can expl—”
Crash. Suddenly, I’ve fallen off my invisible skis and am on my knees at the bottom of the Alp. My hands and knees sting as I struggle for footing in the freezing snowbank. After only a moment, the snowbank begins to quickly recede to reveal a frozen lake underneath. Placing both my palms on the sheet of ice below me, I try to stand up, but stop abruptly as I notice my reflection in the ice. Someone else’s eyes stare back into mine from the lake’s surface. I flinch, but then cannot stop myself from leaning closer. I trace the outline of my reflection in the lake, panicking as it becomes less and less like mine, my hair growing longer, and my lips growing fuller. I feel a knot form in my throat. I attempt to yell but no sound escapes my lungs. Finally, I let out a scream. The voice that emerges is not my own.
***
As my mom and I made our way into our small one-bedroom apartment, I was ready to die. My feet dragged as I marched myself to the bathroom to compose myself.  Looking into the mirror, I imagined my lips growing fuller and my hair growing longer. When I boarded that train that morning, I was not sure if I would have the bravery to die today. Yet there was no denying that the pressure of the air around me was different, just different enough, in fact, to help me muster up the courage to do so. Perhaps, my brief encounter with the bickering couple at Gallery Place-Chinatown had broken something deep within me that had been preventing me from taking this crucial next step. Maybe it was the way I had envied the girl holding her mother’s hand at Metro Center. Or it could have been the single comforting face among the DCTA students on the train. Maybe, it was all of these things combined.  I looked back into the mirror once more and whispered something barely audibly.
“I am not a boy, and I am not going to live as one any longer.”
Relief washed over me like the downpour outside as I finally admitted this truth to myself. My reflection slowly faded until the reflection from the alpine lake of my dream was looking back at me instead. It was the reflection of a woman. I let out a sigh. It was time for the old me to die and the new me to come to life. I stepped out the bathroom and walked into the kitchen where my mom was preparing dinner and where she would finally learn my truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard placed the College’s largest campus Christian group on a year-long, unprecedented “administrative probation” in February, after The Crimson reported that the group asked a woman to step down from a leadership position upon hearing that she was dating another female student.
Since then, Harvard College Faith and Action's punishment has stirred up controversy on campus — and confusion about what exactly the “administrative probation” entails.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman announced the consequences in an email to The Crimson, less than 24 hours after reporters asked him for comment about the group’s decision to ask the female member to step down from her position as an assistant bible course leader.
In an emailed statement in February, then-HCFA presidents Scott Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18 wrote the College put the group on probation because of its “relationship” with Christian Union — the parent group that funds and helps support HCFA.
Ely and Richmond defended their decision to ask the woman to step down, citing an “irreconcilable theological disagreement” and a failure to comply with the organization’s character standards as the reasons for her removal.
After the punishment was annouced, the terms of “administrative probation” drew confusion from Undergraduate Council representatives and HCFA members alike. Administrators declined to clarify the terms of HCFA’s probation.
The Crimson reported that probation would have little immediate effect on the organization, and it still enjoyed privileges accorded to student groups, such as reserving spaces, recruiting students, and receiving funding from the UC once the consequences began. HCFA also operated a booth at last year’s Visitas Activities Fair for admitted students during its probation.
The UC swiftly denounced HCFA’s conduct and affirmed its commitment to the Harvard BGLTQ community in a resolution passed one week after The Crimson first reported the story. In March, the Council moved to withhold funding from the organization, once it became apparent that probation did not preclude the organization from receiving UC funds.
In order to re-earn recognition, the College stipulated that HCFA must sever ties with its parent organization, Christian Union — which provided HCFA $683,247 in the 2017 fiscal year — in order to demonstrate “local autonomy” in compliance with Harvard’s local governance policies as outlined in the Harvard Student Handbook.
In the months after administrators announced the probation, some students said they were frustrated that the College did not enforce more stringent penalties against HCFA. In a private meeting with students, Associate Dean of Students for Diversity and Inclusion Roland S. Davis said the punishment was lenient because Harvard did not want to be seen as waging war on Christianity. He later walked back on his remarks.
HCFA’s probation ends in February 2019, and administrators will decide then whether to reinstate the group.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a months-long search process filled with secretive meetings and surprising twists, the Harvard Corporation selected Lawrence S. Bacow to be the University’s 29th President in February.
The nine-month search kicked off after former University President Drew G. Faust announced in June 2017 that she would be stepping down the following year. Led by William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — the team of 15 searchers from the Corporation and the Harvard Board of Overseers began interviewing candidates and higher education experts across the country.
In January, the search committee held a secret, all-day meeting at the home of Corporation member and searcher Tracy P. Palandjian ’93 in Belmont, Mass., where Crimson reporters identified at least three members of the committee. The meeting was one of at least 17 secretive meetings that the committee held during the search process.
On Feb. 12, after months of silence, the committee announced that Bacow would succeed Faust. Bacow formerly served as the president of Tufts University and the chancellor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Bacow — who has ties to Harvard Law School, Harvard Kennedy School, and Harvard Graduate School of Education — served on the search committee for months as a member of the Corporation before quietly stepping down to become a candidate. Bacow was hiding in plain sight: The Overseers’ eventual vote to confirm a leader from within the selection committee itself is without precedent in recent Harvard history.
In his first remarks as president-elect, Bacow spoke about the need to address criticisms levied at higher education, and he later told The Crimson he was in “sponge mode” learning about his new job. Over the summer, Bacow met with the deans of Harvard’s 12 schools and legislators in Washington, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck E. Schumer ’71 (D-NY), U.S. Senator Mike D. Crapo (R-ID), and U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA).
The University’s new president also made a string of administrative appointments early in his tenure, appointing Claudine Gay Dean of the Faculty of Arts Sciences in July. Gay, who previously served as dean of social science became the first woman and first person of color to hold the position.
Bacow was officially sworn into office at an Oct. 6 inaugural ceremony attended by his four living presidential predecessors, Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, and student demonstrators protesting Harvard’s sexual misconduct policies, among others.
Considered to be the  man for the moment with his decades of experience in higher education, Bacow takes charge at a time when Harvard finds itself subject to a slew of of lawsuits, a new endowment tax imposed by D.C. lawmakers, and criticism that the University only caters to America’s elite.
During his first several months in office, Bacow hit the road as part of his goal to convince people across the country that the University can have a positive impact on their lives. So far, Bacow has visited his home state of Michigan as well as San Diego, Calif.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior Timothy Brownell has seen no shortage of success during his stint in a Harvard Crimson squash uniform. Playing in the top three for the second ranked team in the nation, Brownell has earned his spot after two consecutive All-Ivy first team nominations and an appearance in the national semifinals as a sophomore. His dominance at the collegiate level was no surprise to anyone who followed his high school career, however. Brownell― a Belmont, Mass. native― captained his high school squad for three years and earned three U.S. Squash All-American nominations before continuing his play for the Crimson.
In order to achieve such a consistent level of success, an athlete must perfect every aspect surrounding their game. Although Harvard’s current squad is nationally ranked and loaded with talent, it lacks the same collegiate experience that some other top-ranked teams have, a disadvantage that the Crimson must make up for with extensive preparation.
“Preparation is extremely important, especially since we’re a young team and a lot of the teams we’re playing are a lot older than us,” Brownell said.
Brownell’s personal preparation serves as a testament to his success, as the constant maintenance of his duffel bag both before practices and matches keeps him playing at the top of his game, even in the occurrence of an unexpected mishap. From the multiple pairs of shoes that are constantly rotated to the notebook where his expectations for a match are documented, Timothy Brownell’s duffel bag covers every aspect of his game efficiently.
“I’ll start with the middle pocket”
 The middle pocket is the main component of the bag, where Brownell stores at least two pairs of shoes at all times. The key to the bag, and to the game of squash, according to Brownell, are the shoes.
“Movement is so important in squash,” Brownell said. “If you feel uncomfortable at any moment in squash you’re going to lose.”
This conclusion was reached after years of experience. Brownell struggled to settle with a single pair of shoes for over a year after Asics discontinued the production of the pair he used throughout high school.
“I would have issues with them not feeling right or getting blisters,” said Brownell when mentioning the multiple pairs that he went through before finding his current go-to model, which he keeps several pairs of in different colorways.
The Side Pocket
The side pocket always holds four to five racquets due to the possibility of strings breaking as often as they do in many tennis matches. Although it is rare that all of the racquets will be necessary in a single match, guaranteeing a consistent outcome is something that Brownell emphasizes through his extensive preparation.
“You want to be able to go everyday without worrying about a single thing without the bag,” Brownell said.
The theme of being safer than sorry is reiterated in Brownell’s gear. Keeping several shirts in the bag, he always leaves himself the opportunity to change between matches in order to stay as comfortable as possible.
Packing a Matchday Mentality into the Duffel
Perhaps the most important component of the bag, however, is one that would initially be dismissed by many. Brownell keeps a small, black notebook in his duffel bag filled with gear and equipment that is essential to performing during the matches. This handbook, seeming completely out of place, is actually his key to maintaining the proper mentality going into a match.
“Squash is such a mental game,” Brownell emphasized. “If you come in and you're nervous and not prepared, you're gonna get chopped up by someone who is tougher than you mentally.”
Brownell calls it “scripting”: a process in which he visualizes and how he wants to perform and feel during a match and documents these visions in his notebook. The scripting tradition, implemented by head coach Mike Way, is extremely important for a team as young as the Crimson’s current roster.
“It's about getting your head in the right place,” Brownell said. “If the crowd is loud and you're nervous, you're in trouble. This happens especially with freshman.”
Adding to the Bag
Although consistency is stressed by Brownell to be a key in his success, the nature of the sport that he plays often prevents him from getting too comfortable with his situation. From the constantly-alternating practice schedule to the inexact match times, Brownell had to adjust through experience, adding certain components to the duffel that were not there initially.
“I'd have times freshman year when I would have a good lunch and I'd be ready to go and then I'd sit behind this court and get so excited for my teammates,” Brownell reflects. “By the time I got on the court, however, I would be exhausted.”
In order to maintain his composure and preserve his energy going into a match, Brownell found that a simple addition to the bag was extremely effective: headphones.
“It's not even to listen to music it's more so to drown out the noise,” he stated. “I often get too excited watching my teammates and it drains me mentally so I had to adjust.”
Squash’s inconsistent schedule has prompted another addition to Brownell’s bag: a large variety of energy-packing granola bars. Snacks have proven to be essential during matches, as the time in which Brownell actually steps onto the court is dependant on how long the matches leading up last. In order to preserve his energy, Brownell has found the snacks to be extremely useful in his duffel. 
As Brownell continues his dominant season on the court, looking for another All-Ivy nomination and a successful run in the national tournament, the duffel bag will prove to be indispensable. Whether it’s the need for a better grip on his racquet or to prepare mentally before the start of a match, Timothy Brownell’s preparation will be the ultimate determinant to his success, setting an example for a young team learning to take the next step towards greatness.
