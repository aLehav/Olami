After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Dancers are absolutely fascinating spiritual and artistic people; they have this added dimension of being obviously in touch with their physical selves and having to work on that, having to discipline themselves through daily training, just as an athlete does.”
Sarah L. Kaufman has dedicated her life to the art of dance. For almost 30 years, she has been the chief dance critic and senior arts writer of the Washington Post. This past year, she was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard and will be teaching a course on feature writing through the Extension School this summer. The Nieman Fellowship is a longstanding and prestigious fellowship that brings in journalists from around the world to pursue a course of study at Harvard for one school year: In the words of Kaufman, “It allows working, usually mid-career, journalists an opportunity to audit classes and take a step back from their work.” In their two semesters at Harvard, Nieman fellows can audit classes across all departments and schools, with permission of the instructors. “We’re given an opportunity to dive into things we want to learn but haven't had a chance to, things that we want to expand our knowledge of, whether for personal or professional reasons,” Kaufman said.
Though her career has been in journalistic writing (she even won the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 2010), her time at Harvard has been spent exploring myriad fields, from playwriting with Sam Marks, to “US Congress and Lawmaking” with David King at the Kennedy School, to “The Conduct of Life” with Cornel R. West and Roberto M. Unger (LL.M.; S.J.D). She described her selections as “worldview classes” that bring together “history and culture, the mind and the heart.”
Kaufman expressed immense gratitude for the Nieman fellowship.
“It has been an amazing gift to be able to meet all kinds of people, to have multi-disciplinary interactions, multi-generational interactions, and just have your world really opened up. And to do all that at Harvard,” she said.
In her career as a dance critic, Kaufman has carved out a revolutionary path. Having trained in a pre-professional dance program in high school, it wasn’t until college that she first thought of combining her love of dance with her love of writing.
“I blurted something out on the phone to the editor of the Washington city paper who was Jack Shafer, who became very well known, with Slate and now with Politico,”she said. “He was the editor of the city paper at the time and somehow I, as a college sophomore English major with zero journalism experience, convinced him that he really needed to run ballet reviews.” And that was just the beginning.
While pursuing a master’s degree in journalism at Northwestern University, she began writing about dance for Chicago papers. Her work in arts criticism took her to the Buffalo News, then to Europe when her husband got a fellowship there for a year and a half, and then back to the Washington D.C. area, where she became the stringer dance critic for the Washington Post. She eventually made her way up the ladder at the Post, becoming the chief dance critic in 1996, a position she still holds today.
After achieving this prestigious position, she knew she wanted to focus her lens as an experienced dance critic on more than just reviews of performances on stage.
“I wanted to broaden out and not just look at dance on the stage but the whole world. That led me to really expanding beyond the conventional view of what a dance critic does,” she said. Indeed, this is what has made her work groundbreaking: paying attention to otherwise overlooked aspects of a dancer’s life. “I’m fascinated by the daily practice, the way they live, what they eat, what kind of shoes they wear when they're walking on the street,” she said.
Through this extensive behind-the-scenes work, Ms. Kaufman has come to forge real connections in the intimate community of dancers. She shared a wonderful story that exemplifies the communal power of the dance world: “I talked to one dancer who would take her wedding ring off before every performance, string it on elastic, tie the elastic around her waist, tuck it into the waistband of her tights, and then go on stage,” she recalled. One night, when the diamond in her wedding ring was lost, “the whole cast converged back onto the stage, scoured every inch through the hallways into the dressing room, and finally found her tiny diamond under the chair of her dressing table.”
Kaufman’s all-encompassing view of dance is wholeheartedly expressed in her 2015 book “The Art of Grace: On Moving Well Through Life.” Inspired by Cary Grant — “his emblematic work of giving real attention to body language, to the external display of an internal character,” she said — this book approaches grace with three prongs: physical, spiritual, and social connotations. By tying celebrities in the arts like Beyoncé and Denzel Washington together with NASCAR drivers and restaurant waiters, the book establishes graceful movement as universal.
“I wanted to get beyond the notion of grace as an elite or maybe even only feminine quality,” she said. In effect, Kaufman decided to write against the gatekeeping of grace. She does acknowledge that some people have more natural abilities than others, but that is true of any particular trait looked at: “I really wanted to humanize [grace]. I really wanted to show the universal application and the universal enactment of it. And that's also the journalistic viewpoint, to try to get at the universe in every person's individual story.” Indeed, this value of interpersonal connection and empathy comes through in her work.
To hear Kaufman speak is to be inspired by her investment in studying the myriad choreographed movements of humanity.
“There's an art to all of us, and when you ask people to reflect on the care and attention and striving for excellence that they put into whatever they do, that's a real opportunity to learn about all of these dance-like things that connect us,” she said. And it is Kaufman’s ability to pay attention to the small details — physical or otherwise — that leads her to find grace in everyone, everywhere, in the everyday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 30 percent of Muslim undergraduates do not feel that they belong at Harvard.
I was one of 26 Harvard affiliates whose positive Covid-19 test was later invalidated. While in isolation, I could not access food other than what Harvard provided me. The menu options were limited by my halal dietary restriction and personal preference, so some days, I was left eating macaroni and cheese for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. On a day when I could not eat anything on the menu and I requested macaroni and cheese, my order was messed up and the only food delivered to me was some chips with guacamole.
Limited halal dining is just one of the many ways that Harvard fails its Muslim students.
According to Harvard’s Pulse Survey, only 61 percent of Muslim students feel like they belong at Harvard, compared to 70 to 79 percent of students of other faiths. This stark difference in the sense of belonging between Muslims and those of other religious groups raises concerns about the inclusion of Muslims on Harvard’s campus. However, little has been done or is being done to decrease institutional and interpersonal discrimination against Muslims.
Harvard University Dining Services’s daily menu options open to all students are consistently limited for Muslim students because they often contain alcohol and or use non-halal meat. Up until this semester, very limited halal options were provided to Muslim students. Around two decades ago, HUDS gained some halal options, but since then some options have been removed, leaving grilled chicken as the only guaranteed daily halal option since 2015.
Though HUDS has increased the available menu options this semester, the experience is nowhere near as robust or as reliable as regular dining, even after twenty years of student advocacy. The halal menu items this semester resemble the descriptions of regular dining. However, no matter the description, the meals are variations of grilled chicken, fish, hamburger patties, hot dogs, or strips of beef. Given my continual disappointment, I am unfazed and unsurprised when anything with “meatballs” is just a cut-up hamburger patty or when “chicken fingers” are cut-up pieces of the same grilled chicken that was offered to us before advocating for change. On the surface, the halal menu descriptions have changed. However, nothing has actually fundamentally improved for Muslim students’ dining experience.
As if dietary disappointments were not enough, Harvard’s spiritual support for Muslim students is nascent and limited. We currently have two Muslim chaplains, Chaplains Khalil Abur-Rashid and Samia Omar: Imam Abdur-Rashid was hired in July of 2017 as Harvard’s first full-time Muslim chaplain, and Ustadha Samia is the first Muslim woman chaplain at Harvard. Despite the growing Muslim community, large Harvard Islamic Society, and rampant Islamophobia that has only escalated from 9/11 and Trump’s presidency, Harvard’s first official spiritual full-time faculty support of Muslim students came four decades after the community’s initial growth.
Similarly, unlike Harvard’s commitment to Christian and Jewish students by providing them prominent above-ground spaces including Memorial Church and Hillel, Harvard provides no such space for Muslim students.
Since 1993, Muslim students have been hidden away in Canaday’s basement, given a small space — a walk-in closet — for their religious practices and traditions. For the Friday community prayer, the Harvard Muslim community congregates in Lowell Lecture Hall. So while there are spaces for Muslims on campus, they are limited and hidden, shared by both undergraduate and graduate students.
Without a multicultural center or another center for religious minorities, Harvard demonstrates no structural commitment to these groups. We are told that we are not even worthy of above-ground physical spaces.
Further, many spaces at Harvard are not free of blatantly Islamophobic sentiments or microaggressions fueled by misunderstanding and bigotry. Even at one of the world’s leading institutions, Muslim students continue to have to respond to bigoted claims that Islam is oppressive and backwards, and are sometimes seen as simply providing an educational experience for our peers to understand so-called “Islamic” or “Islamist” terrorism. A number of times, my peers and I have been told we are oppressed by Islam, and our criticisms of Islamophobia are dismissed. Harvard supposedly attracts the smartest people in the world, yet too many fail to grasp the basic tenets of Islam and apply a more nuanced understanding of Muslims.
If I wanted to confide in someone about these many challenges of being a Muslim at Harvard, I should be able to go to Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services. Yet, as a Muslim, I will not find anyone there who shares the same faith.
As co-president of the Harvard Islamic Society, I ask the Harvard administration and the greater Harvard community to take concrete steps to remedy the stigmatization of Muslims in our community.
Harvard must, first, expand and integrate halal dining. Second, hire more Muslim therapists. Third, provide larger prayer and social spaces for Muslims. And fourth give significant resources to educate Harvard students and faculty about Islamophobia. Throughout this process, Harvard should provide transparency and accessible and consistent avenues for feedback.
Harvard, do not overlook members of your community. Show us that we were not just admitted to be put on diversity websites.
Show us we belong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council earlier this month rejected a policy order on police demilitarization proposed by Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan that sparked bitter debate among both activists and politicians in Cambridge.
Zondervan, who chairs the council’s public safety committee, proposed a policy order that called for the “destruction and recycling” of all rifles and shotguns, and the “elimination” of Cambridge Police Department’s Lenco BearCat — a $350,000 armored vehicle which the Department acquired through a Department of Homeland Security grant.
CPD previously faced backlash for its possession of military-grade equipment, which came to light after the department supplied the city with an inventory of its possessions in 2020 following Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr.’s statement that CPD did not possess military equipment. Bard later clarified, however, that he meant the department “did not possess materials that are only restricted to the military by law.”
In February, the Cambridge Chronicle first reported that CPD would be reducing its inventory of long guns and less-than-lethal weapons by 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively. The department also announced the retirement of camouflage uniforms used by officers.
Zondervan’s policy order stated that this move “does not go far enough to address calls to demilitarize the police” and requested City Manager Louis A. DePasquale work with CPD to present a plan to the Council for further demilitarization ahead of the next fiscal year’s budget hearings.
City councilors opposed Zondervan’s policy order, and instead Councilor Marc C. McGovern proposed an amended version, which passed 8-1 on May 3. Zondervan was the only councilor to vote against.
Whereas Zondervan’s order called on CPD to purge all “rifles and shotguns,” as well as the armored vehicle, McGovern proposed the city manager work with Bard to follow up CPD’s February goals.
Spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an emailed statement that CPD will keep interested parties informed of any developments via an annual inventory report or City Council meetings.
“In terms of inventory, we will continue to keep the community informed of any developments via our annual inventory report and at future City Council and/or public safety committee meetings,” Warnick wrote. “That said, Commissioner Bard and the Cambridge Police have demonstrated an openness and willingness to be at the forefront of meaningful police reform.”
Cambridge resident and activist Loren Crowe, an Army veteran who worked with Bard on his February demilitarization announcement, took to Twitter the next day to criticize Zondervan’s policy order, calling it “grandstanding” and “counter-productive.” He also argued that Bard had taken steps to demilitarize previously on his own volition.
“But every time Bard has announced steps he's taking to demilitarize CPD, Councillor Zondervan has responded with pure petulance,” he wrote. “When a public official does something good, you might offer a little positive reinforcement. Not doing so makes it seem like you'll never be happy.”
Crowe said in an interview that the order was “counterproductive” because Zondervan asked CPD to dispose of all rifles and shotguns, which Crowe said he believes is too extreme and “discredits” the demilitarization movement. He also said he believes demilitarization is more about a militarized “culture” than the possession of specific weapon systems.
“I think that Cambridge, at the end of the day, could be fully demilitarized and would still have a SWAT team,” he said. “It still needs to have the capability to respond to certain kinds of incidents.”
Crowe also tweeted that Zondervan did not consult with CPD prior to his policy order.
In an interview with The Crimson, Zondervan said it was untrue he did not consult with CPD, citing a Jan. 6 public safety committee hearing he chaired. During that meeting, Bard gave a presentation on CPD’s weapon arsenal and made his case as to why CPD needed certain weapons.
“After meeting with the commissioner and after the committee hearing, it was pretty clear to me that police and the city manager have no intention of getting rid of these weapons,” Zondervan said.
ACLU of Massachusetts staff attorney Daniel McFadden said in an interview that full demilitarization does not have a “single definition.” He added, however, that some of the different aspects of militarization involve the equipment police have access to, their use of “war tactics,” and the language surrounding policing.
“You often hear about police who refer to non-police as civilians, but of course, we’re all civilians,” McFadden said. “So this idea that there’s a separation between the police and the population that they’re policing also is a component of militarization.”
Tapti Sen, an activist with The Black Response — a Cambridge group calling for the defunding and abolishing of CPD — said in an interview prior to the May 3 vote that she was “optimistic” the reform would eventually take place. Sen said at the time that if the order did not pass, The Black Response would continue to advocate for demilitarization.
“If it doesn’t pass, we’re going to continue to campaign for it,” Sen said. “We’re going to continue to make it one of our prominent goals and just continue to work towards that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 Radcliffe College alumnae signed onto letters protesting a decision by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study to adopt the vernacular name Harvard Radcliffe Institute earlier this year.
The Institute announced the name change on Jan. 28, but several alumnae expressed concern after seeing it referred to as the Harvard Radcliffe Institute in a mailing in advance of Radcliffe Day later this month, after which multiple classes, including the classes of 1968 and 1971, sent letters to Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin.
In a letter from the class of 1968, nearly 80 alumnae spoke out against the name change.
“Recent mailings from Harvard University have referred to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study as the ‘Harvard Radcliffe Institute,’” the letter read. “The undersigned Radcliffe alumnae ... are writing to deplore this in the strongest terms.”
A separate letter signed by around 70 people — spearheaded by Katherine W. Bernier ’71 and also including some male alumni of the College — made similar complaints.
“There are still those of us, kicking and contributing, who were admitted to Radcliffe College; and many have already expressed horror and chagrin at the casual dismissive gesture of adding Harvard, the bastion of male privilege and early denier of women’s education, to the name of the Radcliffe Institute,” Bernier’s letter read.
In a response to the letter from the class of 1968, Brown-Nagin noted that the official name of the Institute will remain the Radcliffe Institute but that the new “shorthand” helps clarify the Institute’s standing within Harvard and among the public.
“Our full name remains the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University; that name is and will continue to be apparent in our website and public-facing materials,” she wrote.
“However, it has been clear for some time that the Institute’s achievements—a testament to its visionary leaders and loyal supporters—suffer from a lack of understanding of our purpose and history, both within the Harvard community and among the broader public,” she added.
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies was formally established as an independent entity in 1999 following the merging of Radcliffe College with Harvard College.
Prior to the merger, the Institute was contained within Radcliffe College and known as the Bunting Institute, after former Radcliffe College president Mary I. “Polly” Bunting. Bunting founded it as the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study in 1960 to combat the “climate of non-expectation” for female scholars.
The Institute announced a redesign of its website alongside the new vernacular name in January 2021. Though the new site contains the full name — Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study — in bold letters on the homepage, the site refers to the Institute as the Harvard Radcliffe Institute.
Nancy Stieber ’71, who also served as a fellow at the Institute from 2000-2001, said she was “shocked” to see the Radcliffe shield “juxtaposed” with the words “Harvard Radcliffe Institute.”
“Everyone connected directly with whom I’ve shared this new logo has been perturbed and upset by seeing it,” she said.
Susan S. Smart ’71 noted she believes the name change is “a violation of the spirit” of the 1999 agreement, which, according to Stieber, calls for the Institute to “sustain a continuing commitment” to the study of women, gender and society.
Smart added that the name change could signal the Radcliffe name’s “descent into obscurity,” quoting the letter from Bernier.
“The renaming was probably not intended to mean that, but presenting the public face of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, instead of honoring the creator of the Radcliffe Institute, is unacceptable to many of us,” Smart said.
Institute spokesperson Jane F. Huber wrote in an email that the Institute does not believe the “introduction of a shorter vernacular name” is a threat to the legacy of Radcliffe College, emphasizing that the Institute’s position is that the change “reflects our commitment to preserve, amplify, and expand on that legacy.”
“We are genuinely saddened that some alumnae feel that Radcliffe is being diminished,” she wrote, noting that the legacy of Radcliffe College “remains vital to today’s Radcliffe Institute.”
Huber added that the purpose of the vernacular change was for practical publicity purposes after feedback that the name was “too cumbersome” and did not “clearly suggest Radcliffe’s relationship to Harvard University.”
“We were increasingly being cited simply as ‘an institute at Harvard,’ and we felt that if we did not take action, this common usage would lead to the erasure of Radcliffe,” she wrote. “The adoption of Harvard Radcliffe Institute is an effort to protect the legacy and name of Radcliffe.”
Brown-Nagin also noted in her reply to the class of 1968 that she had received support for the change from other graduates of Radcliffe College.
“Indeed, while I understand and appreciate your concerns regarding our new branding, I also heard from many alumnae who value the clearer links we are creating to the history of Radcliffe College,” she wrote.
Bernier said Brown-Nagin’s response was “gracious,” but “may not have realized how offensive [the change] would be to so many,” noting she was “fine” with the less publicity if the full name was preserved.
“I think it’s well-known among serious scholars who are interested in those kinds of opportunities — at least enough of them to fill the roster of the year,” she said.
Ann B. Lesk ’68, however, called the Institute’s response, specifically the Dean’s letter, “dismissive,” noting that her class had suggested the alternative “Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University.”
“You want the Harvard name on it? Make it the ‘Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University,’” she said. “Don’t submerge Radcliffe in ‘Harvard Radcliffe Institute.’”
Lesk added that the change had made her, along with other Radcliffe College alumnae as well as some alumni of Harvard College, rethink their donations to the Institute.
“I will, for instance, will direct all future contributions to the Schlesinger Library, which is very much true to the original spirit of the Radcliffe Institute,” she said. “Others of my classmates have said that they are no longer interested in supporting the Institute as a result of this.”
“I hope President Bacow will take another look at this,” she added.
