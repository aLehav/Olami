After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a four-letter solution to America’s economic crisis. STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) fields are burgeoning as a job market, but companies in this sector struggle to find qualified candidates in the U.S. because America’s academic performance in this area is decidedly lackluster. The obvious remedy? Get kids interested in science, and jobs will follow.
Championing this cause in its annual philanthropy campaign last year, Google made significant charitable donations to sixteen organizations that are “working to give a new generation of students a chance to embrace science, technology, engineering, and math—and to pursue the rewarding careers that so often follow.” In order to ensure that such careers do follow, however, STEM programs need to engage students beyond the K-12 level.
Too often, STEM-related initiatives focus disproportionately on inspiring children and adolescents without providing enough support at the more critical post-secondary level. For instance, most of the organizations supported by the Google Gives Back campaign, including Girl Scouts of Northern California, the Roberta Initiative, and Citizen Schools, encourage a general interest in science among elementary and middle school children. Although early exposure to the sciences is certainly necessary, and positive experiences can be formative, getting kids interested in math and science is only half the battle. To ensure that children’s passion for STEM leads into actual careers, we must sustain and support this interest through adulthood.
Many academically promising students enter college with an interest in the sciences, but a whopping 40% drop out of STEM-related majors and career paths over the course of their four years. This alarming trend suggests a dissonance between students’ expectations and the reality of what it takes to excel in STEM. A student whose love for chemistry was first inspired by a hands-on experiment conducted with the help of his favorite eighth grade teacher might be unhappily surprised to discover that in college, introductory courses are extremely large, professors often focus more on researching than on teaching, and job prospects after graduate school are sometimes limited to becoming a perennial post-doc. The sharp decline in interest in STEM careers at the collegiate level renders interest-stimulating STEM efforts at the elementary and middle school levels null.
STEM initiatives must move beyond the traditional focus on early education to provide students with resources and support at this crucial academic stage. Nationally, 60% of aspiring physicians drop out of the college pre-medical track, although many of those students enter college with a strong background and interest in science. Strict medical school enrollment caps notwithstanding, the pre-med dropout rate could conceivably be lowered if a multitude of STEM initiatives existed at the college level to support students’ interests in medical careers. For instance, following the example of novel initiatives like the twelve-university Summer Medical and Dental Education Program and Harvard’s own Program for Research in Science in Engineering, there is potential for federally funded, large-scale efforts to ensure that historically underrepresented groups like minority students are not disadvantaged from studying health sciences at the college level.
Collegiate STEM support should by no means limit itself to pre-medicine tracks. The STEM field is unparalleled in its diversity, yet many students frankly do not realize that they have science career options besides becoming a doctor or engineer. When stressful demands push students to forgo their engineering or health profession plans, they often look into careers in finance and business rather than into other science professions. Of the 3.4 million students enrolled in graduate school in 2006, only 600,000 of them were scholars of science or engineering. Clearly, we need to expose college students to a greater variety of viable science career options. This exposure can take the form of more involved science-related career advising akin to the myriad pre-med resources that already exist at most competitive institutions. It should also involve significant expansion of shadowing programs that connect students to researchers, technology developers, and other professionals who would otherwise remain inaccessible.
Finally, STEM initiatives should shoulder the simple but serious responsibility of reminding stressed college students that science can be fun. When a child discovers the vastness of the cosmos or the biological diversity of the ocean for the first time, he is awestruck. Unfortunately, somewhere between the "Magic School Bus" days and the senior thesis proposal, this feeling fades for many a jaded student. Therefore, if STEM advocates want students to retain a passion for scientific inquiry, they must find ways for university science departments to reinforce the sense of wonder that initially draws young minds to science.
The current model of STEM education exhorts sixth graders to aspire to become paleontologists and titillates high school sophomores with the implications of forensic science only to abandon college freshmen in a sea of dry physics textbooks and three-story lecture halls that must be traversed to reach the graduate degrees, post-graduate fellowships, and post-post graduate trainings that might actually lead to STEM careers. This is not a solution to America’s STEM deficit. Supporting post-secondary STEM education may very well prove more difficult, resource-intensive, and risky than dazzling third graders with a baking soda volcano, but the rewards of doing so will be equally explosive.

It is about time for the Harvard Corporation to finally stand up to the bloated, budget-busting tyranny of the Harvard University Library.  Since John Harvard gave the university its first endowment of 400 books and a paltry 780 pounds to manage them, the library has been an odious drain on University finances.
Current plans to restructure Harvard libraries and institute deep cuts to staff, services, and collections in the consecrated name of financially responsible austerity are the result of the Library Task Force Report. This report was commissioned in 2009 to plan the slaying of the dread budgetary Scylla of Harvard Yard, Widener Library.  The Library Task Force Report represents a new vision for the library, arguing that Harvard is no longer in any position to try to “collect and maintain the entirety of the world’s scholarship”.  After all, why might a university with a peerless endowment also be expected to maintain an equally unrivaled library?
With an endowment of 32 billion dollars growing in 2011 at a meager 21.4%, Harvard simply can no longer afford to maintain the best and largest academic library collection in the world.  The library’s $225 million operating budget, an outrageous 5.7% of the University’s annual budget, must be further cut to improve the financial profile of the University. Although cutting costs and improving efficiency and effectiveness are not mutually exclusive, the Library Task Force Report makes clear that the Harvard Corporation has its miserly heart in the right place.  Why attempt to improve efficiency without laying off workers, or effectiveness without cutting resources? 
The most crucial reforms commenced with the curbing of the library’s gluttonous book buying.  The Harvard Corporation stuck to its astute business strategy even in the face of opposition from over one hundred faculty members, who in response passionately called for the library to be allocated adequate funds to purchase needed new materials. The $12 million budget reduction in 2010 was another step in the right direction.  The preceding year, Harvard paid only $8.4 million to Stephen Blyth, the head of internal investments at Harvard Management Company, and he oversaw billions of dollars added to Harvard coffers. In contrast, the Library costs over $200 million per year and generates very little revenue. Faculty, students, staff, and researchers are tragically myopic stakeholders in the Harvard Corporation if they prioritize the maintenance of a preeminent book collection when it has consistently posted miserable returns on investment, especially as compared to Mr. Blyth.  The Harvard Corporation should continue to retract funding from its unprofitable knowledge capital and reinvest in more profitable sectors, like Gatsbyian birthday parties with gourmet cakes the size of the Woodberry Poetry Room
A recent Crimson editorial made the important point that Harvard must catch up with technological progress, even at the cost of significant staff cuts.  As a library employee at Widener, I have a particular insight into the excesses of the library staff. As preparation for my impending consulting interview, I have identified some examples of how employees might be replaced by technology, thereby saving thousands of dollars.  First, the experienced professionals who find rare and new publications from even the smallest bookshops, publishing houses, and universities across the world can easily be replaced by Google Books trending feature and the New York Times Top 10 Bestsellers.  (Amazon Listmania might be needed for more esoteric subjects requiring truly expert opinions.)  The Houghton Rare Books library and book preservation department positions can simply be abolished, as old books are irrelevant in the age of the Kindle.  The same goes for Mr. Widener’s musty, out-of-date books and Gutenberg Bible—the King James Bible has an expired copyright and can be downloaded on Project Gutenberg. And when you come to me and ask for help navigating thousands of archives and special collections, an automated voice could instead cheerily direct you to Wikipedia, or in a potential post-SOPA world, an Ouija board.
In a widely circulated Washington Post editorial, Alexandra Petri '10 called on Occupy Harvard to turn its attentions away from the abuses of the Harvard Corporation and instead to focus on “getting a grip on some small portion of the vast array of human knowledge” by “Occupy[ing] the libraries.” The current assault on the library exemplifies the limits of this passive and ultimately self-destructive understanding of knowledge. True intellectualism is daring to peek above the confines of carrels and actively engaging with knowledge, described best by the great pedagogue Paulo Freire as “emerging only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry, human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.” To those who have taken vows of intellectual hermitage, look out the window of our Ivory Tower and see that it stands on and is shaped by political and economic realities that, together, we have the agency to transform.  We can demand that the University as an intellectual center fully fund the library as the depository of knowledge-capital, or we can continue to ignore the perils of a profit-minded university and passively occupy the libraries.  For as long as they let us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last semester, McGill history professor Gil Troy visited Harvard’s campus to give a talk entitled “Why I Am a Zionist.” In an article composed the day after the event, Troy wrote favorably about how he was received at Harvard. He contrasted it with about the “common discourse on campus today” about Israel, speaking of “Jewish students harassed and Israel defamed.”
I am not surprised that Troy found a respectful audience for his talk at Harvard. However, I am embarrassed and disturbed that he anticipated otherwise. Of course, there are many students at Harvard who are pro-Palestinian. Of these, many oppose Israel’s continued occupation of the Gaza Strip, desire a two-state solution that allows Palestinian refugees the right of return, and advocate for a boycott of goods produced in the occupied territories or of all Israeli goods. However, Troy’s expectation relies on the assumption (which he has put forth in other articles) that “pro-Palestinian” means “anti-Semitic.” During my time in both Jewish and pro-Palestinian communities at Harvard, I have found this to be both untrue and counterproductive to meaningful discussion.
On a Friday evening in December, before heading to dinner at Harvard Hillel, I strove to protect a flickering candle from the wind rushing through Harvard Square. Along with dozens of other students, I was standing in vigil for Mustafa Tamimi, a peaceful Palestinian protestor who died after being shot in the head by a tear-gas canister fired by an Israeli soldier. As I covered my candle, I looked around at the faces of 50 people—Muslims, Jews, and others. Some were mourning, others were frightened, others were angry. Not a single one was hateful.
Indeed, in both Jewish spaces and pro-Palestinian spaces at Harvard, I have never witnessed anti-Semitism or defamation of Israel. Unfortunately, I am afraid that many tend to use the term “anti-Semitic” to describe anyone who criticizes the policies of the state of Israel.
Like many, I draw my own opinions about Israel and Palestine from my views on oppression and militarism and my desire for universal economic and social equality. As someone involved in peaceful protest on my own campus, I believe there is great power in nonviolent resistance. Of course, not all on campus, or even all at my Shabbat dinner table, agree with me. However, Harvard students, whether sympathetic with Benjamin Netanyahu’s government or with the global movement calling for a boycott of Israeli goods, all want to end unnecessary bloodshed and suffering. And we all know that hatred is antithetical to constructive discussions and peace.
In 2006, Yale University began the Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism. The initiative sponsored and directed research on historic and contemporary anti-Semitism until it was ended last June. Many noted that it had become too political and disproportionately focused on Muslim anti-Semitism. An op-ed in the Yale Daily News noted that a conference held by the group, featuring a keynote speech entitled “The Central Role of Palestinian Antisemitism in Creating the Palestinian Identity,” had countered hatred of one kind (anti-Semitism) with hatred of another kind (Islamophobia).
The Initiative has since been replaced by the Yale Program for the Study of Antisemitism, which strives to produce more scholarly research. But the damage was done—Yale’s Muslim community expressed alienation and hurt after the controversial conference. Indeed, when all Palestinians, or all who criticize Israel, are labeled “anti-Semitic,” productive discussions about peace can devolve into hateful accusations.
Of course, anti-Semitism is real and present. In fact, two swastikas appeared on the side of a building near Eliot House last semester. But twelve hours later, they were painted over and all but forgotten by Harvard’s Jewish community: The graffiti seemed to me and other students a bizarre and surprising anomaly, not an indication of widespread, hidden hatred. Additionally, some advocates for Palestinian rights are undoubtedly anti-Semitic, just as some advocates for Jewish rights in Israel are anti-Arab or Islamophobic. But these people are far from a norm among pro-Palestinian advocates.
Accusing those who disagree with you of bigotry precludes constructive academic discussions. In fact, charging Palestinian students or pro-Palestinian advocates with anti-Semitism changes the tone of discussion from political to religious. This often provokes the type of resentment that prolongs conflict instead of resolving it. Unfortunately, comments such as Troy’s and initiatives like Yale’s are more likely to spark anger than remorse among students accused of anti-Semitism.
I would like to assure Professor Troy, and anyone else who might be concerned, that arguments for economic sanctions on Israel do not stem from deep-seated anti-Semitism. I know from personal experience that this is true on Harvard’s campus, and I am assured by others that this is generally true across the globe.
Many current Harvard students will grow up to be the politicians, activists, and donors who shape American policy on Israel. If American academics hope to contribute to productive discussion about Israel and Palestine on campuses, they must first cooperate and not issue unfounded accusations of prejudice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the introduction of pre-term planning in the fall of 2010 the College hoped to alleviate many of the woes of shopping week and improve administrative efficiency. The tool would allow for a rough estimate of class size in the succeeding semester and would convert the guessing game of how many teaching fellows to hire and how large of a classroom to allocate into a more exact science. However, since its introduction more than a year ago PTP has neither eliminated problems with course selection nor achieved many of its initial goals.
This is not to say that PTP should be eliminated. Rather, the College could take simple steps to improve the tool and its application. Harvard’s shopping week is a unique feature with benefits to students that far outweigh the costs to the College. Nonetheless, the very nature of shopping makes it difficult for the College and the administration to adequately predict class enrollment before the semester begins. This difficulty could be ameliorated with improvements in PTP.
Allowing students to pre-term plan over J-term and then again over the summer would result in more accurate and useful data. Under the current schedule, PTP for spring classes is due in early November, nearly two months before the semester ends. With papers, exams, and problem sets all due at this time, it is often not a priority for students to create a tentative schedule for the next term’s courses. In a more stress free environment, PTP can be a useful tool for students as they begin to think about their plans of study.
The difficult and byzantine structure of the PTP tool is an added hassle that deters students from taking it seriously. The tool is inconveniently located on a separate webpage from other course planning tools and does not allow users to lay out their upcoming semester in a schedule. Often it is slow and confusing. Navigating the page is not an easy task either and the time students spend inconvenienced is often deducted from time spent on picking classes.
The College should approach PTP more holistically. Instead of simply looking at the results of online PTP, administrators should include a wide range of information. Courses that meet General Education requirements, concentration requirements, and have a high Q score are likely to have high enrollment. Even if the current system itself does not predict this outcome, the College should understand that PTP is not the only way to gauge potential enrollment. Life Sciences 60/Government 1093—“Ethics, Biotechnology, and the Future of Human Nature”—is a good example of this. Students did not select this course in the PTP tool in particularly large numbers and therefore the class was placed in Sever Hall. On day one, the class was so large it had to move to Sanders Theater. With high Q scores, famous professors like Michael J. Sandel and Douglas A. Melton, and the potential to fulfill many government, gen ed, and life science requirements, the College could have easily predicted such a class would far exceed the number of students that PTP predicted for its enrollment.
Even after PTP might be refined, as is necessary, the College should still be prepared to adapt during shopping week. There was a time when PTP did not exist. Classes moved around and TFs were hired or fired. Unfortunately, the introduction of PTP has seemingly made the system more rigid. This means that classes that were not planned and shopped in similar numbers are often lotteried, as in the case of Life Sciences 60. The class, after being moved to Sanders, was cut down to 150 students.
PTP does have a necessary function at Harvard, and simple fixes can improve its accuracy. Such improvements would be beneficial to both the College and to students at little to no cost.

Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp are currently reviewing “aspects of organizational design” as part of the University’s restructuring of its library system, according to a statement from a University spokesperson.
The Library Transition iSite said that the Harvard Library Board would review a plan created by the library’s leaders before making a recommendation to University President Drew G. Faust on how to conduct the reorganization of the library.
The board met to review a plan  last week, and University officials declined to state whether it approved a plan at that time.
Library officials had previously held a town hall meeting for library employees in which they said that their restructuring plan would reduce the size of the library staff.
The announcement prompted anxiety amongst library employees from across the University, who called for Harvard to release more details.
In response to the University’s lack of disclosure to the library workers, staff picketed outside of a meeting for library staff members last Wednesday. Another protest is planned for next week.
While some chose not to protest  actively, the feeling of being left in the dark remained for many.
“The communication has been pretty lousy. There have been very few details coming out about the transition,” said a librarian at Harvard Law School, who, like all librarians interviewed for this story, asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue.
He added, “People are fearful of losing their jobs. The only solid information that came out of the town hall is that there would be reductions of staff.”
Other librarians echoed his concern.
“We haven’t heard anything either. Nothing,” said a librarian at Harvard Kennedy School.
Some said that although it might seem unreasonable to panic before the University releases any concrete information about the scope of the staff reduction, the administration’s silence is at the root of the problem.
“I think that a lot of people are reacting to the fact that we don’t know a lot about what’s going on yet,” said a librarian at the Radcliffe Institute. She added that only once the University provides more information will staff be able to “react in a reasonable manner.”
The University has said it will provide more information on staff reductions in February.

With the Republican primaries still in a dead heat, the Harvard Republican Club has shied away from making an endorsement and has instead maintained a liason structure that helps members contribute to various Republican campaigns.
“We don’t endorse anyone in the primaries, but we are willing to provide our members the opportunity to work with candidates of their choice,” said Derek J. Bekebrede ’13, HRC president.
The HRC adopted a system of liaisons in the fall to organize students interested in becoming involved in each of the candidate’s campaigns. The system—modeled after the HRC’s work in the 2008 primary season—allows students to lead and organize political campaign work for several candidates.
“Members have engaged in activities ranging from phone-banking to door-to-door campaign [in order to] get out the vote and amass support for their respective candidate,” said HRC Romney liaison Aditi Ghai ’14, who has worked in both the New Hampshire and Boston offices while volunteering for Romney’s campaign.
In addition to directing outreach and student activism, the HRC has brought the Ron Paul campaign to speak on campus and organized trips to New Hampshire for students involved in the Romney campaign.
“Volunteering on political campaigns has been fantastic,” said Rajiv Tarigopula ’14, who is HRC Vice President for Speakers and Political Discourse and also a Crimson editorial editor. “From my first experience working with the McCain 2008 campaign in high school, getting involved in the more hands-on elements of democracy has been incredibly fulfilling.”
While many of the HRC’s liaison groups have successfully campaigned in the Northeast, others have had a difficult time getting involved, particularly in Massachusetts.
“It’s been a rough primary, where a lot of campaigns are focusing resources on the next primary,” Santorum liaison Matthew R. Menendez ’14 said. “For example, the Rick Santorum campaign was quite focused on South Carolina, so there hasn’t been that much here.”
Lack of local partisan activity for some liaison groups has caused them to shift their focus to fostering dialogue on campus and participating in issue-based campaigning, such as the March for Life event in Washington, D.C.
Along with the presidential primaries, the HRC is following U.S Senator Scott Brown’s reelection bid.
“There might be fewer conservatives up here,” Bekebrede said, “but Republicans found good candidates and a good way to challenge the liberal majority.”
Members of the group said that conservative’s status as a minority on campus give them opportunities for activism.
“It opens more opportunities,” Menendez said. “It may a little more difficult doing all the work, but it’s not difficult to find work—the opposite of what you see in some of the more liberal causes, where you see a proliferation of groups fighting for the exact same cause.”
Later in February the HRC will attend the Conservative Political Action Conference to meet the presidential candidates.
“There’s more of us than you think,” Menendez said. “It’s really exciting now, but there’s always work to do.”

A little more than a week after losing in South Carolina, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney won the Florida primary with 46 percent of the vote Tuesday, moving him one step closer to the GOP presidential nomination.
The 14-point margin between Romney and runner-up Newt Gingrich will likely reposition the Harvard Law and Business School alumnus as the leading contender for his party’s nomination, Harvard professors said.
“Romney’s going to try to position himself as the presumptive nominee. He’ll probably start to pivot toward the general election,” Institute of Politics Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said, adding “I’m hard-pressed to come up with a viable scenario where he won’t win.”
With the next GOP debate not scheduled until Feb. 22 and the next primary not until Arizona’s on Feb. 28, professors said they anticipated little political activity during the lull that could inhibit Romney’s momentum.
In a speech Tuesday night after his victory, Romney focused on attacking the policies of President Barack Obama, a sign that his attention is shifting from the contest for the nomination to the upcoming general election.
“President Obama wants to fundamentally transform America. We want to restore America to the founding principles that made this country great,” Romney said.
With the Florida victory under his belt, Romney might employ such targeted rhetoric more often, experts said.
“It was clearly a much more focused, tougher-sounding Romney that was really focused on highlighting the differences between him and Obama,” Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Richard Parker said. “I think this is a narrative that will play [well] with a lot of Americans.”
As of press time, Romney had won 46 percent of the vote in Florida, and Gingrich had garnered almost 32 percent. Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Texas Congressman Ron Paul had won 13 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
Tuesday’s primary was the first chance candidates had to test their mettle in a large state.
Florida can send 50 delegates to the Republican national convention in August; of the three contests that preceded Tuesday’s, the largest was in South Carolina, which carries half as many delegates.
Romney’s vast resources and campaign infrastructure gave him a clear advantage in Florida, Harvard professors said.
“It’s advertising, advertising, advertising,” said Pippa Norris II, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. “This is the first...large state, which is very different than the retail politics we had in New Hampshire and the Iowa caucuses.”
According to analysis reported in the New York Times, 92 percent of ads pertaining to the race in Florida were negative.
That negativity fits into a larger trend in Florida in the weeks running up to the primary. After Gingrich won the South Carolina primary, Romney and Gingrich traded blows in debates and in the media, questioning each other’s financial and political records.
Despite expectations earlier this month that Romney would assume the nomination with little difficulty, the path between Iowa and Florida has had its ups and downs, experts said. A different candidate has won each of the previous three contests—Santorum eked out a narrow win in Iowa; Romney took New Hampshire; and Gingrich claimed victory in South Carolina.

The size of this year’s sorority rush class has dipped slightly, one year after a record number of women rushed Harvard’s three sororities. But in this second year of high interest in Greek life, some remain hopeful for the establishment of a fourth sorority.
About 250 Harvard women registered for this week’s rush events, according to Janet M. Yarboi ’12, who is president of the Panhellenic Council, the coordinating body for campus sororities, and an inactive Crimson photo editor.
As recently as 2008, The Crimson reported that about 150 women rushed Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma, Harvard’s three sororities.
Last year, 268 Harvard women participated in rush events, exceeding 200 for the first time, Yarboi said.
“Rush is slightly smaller [than last year], but it’s still an impressive number,” Yarboi said, noting the increase from previous years. “It’s a pretty positive pattern.”
Since the numbers stabilized this year, Yarboi said she was hopeful that the addition of a fourth sorority may happen soon.
“If interest still continues to be this high, we want to accommodate as many people as possible,” Yarboi said.
In the past months, Greek leaders had been hesitant to establish a fourth sorority before they could verify that last year’s high rush numbers were not an anomaly.
“We were all very surprised by the registration numbers [last year], and we didn’t want to rush anything just yet,” Yarboi said.
Already, the increased interest in sororities has led to crowded rush events, prospective members say.
“It was crowded enough that it would definitely be cool to have a fourth sorority,” Danielle N. Tilford ’15 said.
Harvard women who decided to rush said they were motivated in part by the growing popularity of sororities on campus.
“All my friends are rushing because they have friends who are going to rush too,” Alexis C. Igwe ’15 said.
According to Igwe, all nine of her female Canaday C floormates are rushing as well.
Harleen K. Gambhir ’14, who is rushing for the second time after being among the roughly 100 women who did not receive a bid last year, said she has noticed more sophomores in this year’s rush class.
“During that entire process [last year], I met one sophomore,” Gambhir said. “It seems like I’ve been seeing a lot more this year.”
Beginning on Saturday, aspiring sorority members attended a series of meet-and-greets with current sisters as part of Harvard’s rush process.
The women were divided into groups and rotated through events each evening, with fewer women invited back each successive night after the second round.
On Tuesday night, women were asked to rank their choices, while sororities ranked prospective members.
At the end of rush this Thursday night, sororities will extend bids to the women who will make it through the rush process.

Economics professor Claudia D. Goldin was chosen as the president-elect of the American Economic Association, one of the world’s largest coalitions of economics professors, practitioners, and experts. Once elected in 2013, she will be the third female president in the history of the AEA.
“I’m deeply honored to have been chosen by this very large organization as president,” Goldin said. “It is a position with a lot of work and a lot of responsibility.”
The AEA, which serves to promote research in economics, brings together economists from around the world and publishes numerous peer-reviewed journals, including the American Economic Review.
“[The position] is already taking a tremendous amount of time,” Goldin said on her appointment. “As president-elect you have the greatest responsibility and most of the duties.”
Goldin, who received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, is a labor economist and economic historian. Much of her research has focused on the historic roles of education, women, and labor in the U.S. economy.
Along with Economics Professor Lawrence F. Katz, she published the book “The Race between Education and Technology” in 2008. Currently, she teaches both graduate and undergraduate classes, including a seminar titled Economics 980b: “Education in the Economy.”
Goldin, who also served as president of the Economic History Association in 2000, says that she would have to “think hard” about what changes to make to the AEA as president-elect.
“It’s an institution that has existed for a long period of time,” she said. “The changes that I make...are important with regards to making sure that the AEA remains an important and viable institution.”
Among the changes that Goldin will be overseeing as president-elect are the AEA’s new disclosure policies for economic publications.
According to Goldin, this set of directives requires economists who submit articles to the AEA’s journals to list any potential conflicts of interest. This change follows similar policies implemented by The National Bureau of Economic Research last March.
Goldin also discussed the weight of her role as a woman in the male-dominated field of economics.
“At Harvard, it’s pretty clear that the social sciences subject dominated by women is psychology and by men is economics,” Goldin said. “We have to ask here at Harvard why women are going into economics at a level disproportionate to that of men.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alan St. Louis’ dream is to sing the national anthem for the Boston Red Sox. To get there, he’s decided to take the long road – a road that recently stopped in Cambridge.
Last July, St. Louis embarked on a quest to set the world record for most national anthems sung in a 12-month period. For his 57th performance, the Nashua, N.H. native belted out the Star Spangled Banner at the beginning of Harvard women’s basketball’s matchup with Brown on Jan. 29.
St. Louis returned to the Soldiers Field complex this Friday and Saturday to open Harvard women's hockey's games against Princeton and Quinnipiac.
No one officially holds the record for most renditions, and St. Louis believes he may have already set it with 60 as of Jan. 31, but he plans to continue scheduling as many performances as feasibly possible. His Saturday performance at Bright Hockey Center was one of three St. Louis had on the day, but that’s nothing new. At the beginning of the journey back in July, St. Louis sang four to five times a day at American Legion baseball tournaments to jumpstart his campaign.When St. Louis puts the microphone to his mouth, he attempts to sing the song as it was intended.
“I don’t try to embellish it. That’s part of my motivation,” St. Louis said. “I’m a proud American, and I’m not afraid to say it. Too many people are trying to over-sing it or over-embellish it.”
He’s perfected the tune after many years of experience. In fact, St. Louis has been singing national anthems for roughly 20 years and has been in a barber shop quartet for 35.
St. Louis’ biggest venue thus far was a New England Revolution match at Gillette Stadium in front of 14,000 onlookers.
“The stadium was rocking,” St. Louis said. “I can only imagine what it would be like for a full stadium.”
St. Louis said his dream would be to sing for a full crowd before a New England Patriots or Boston Red Sox game. Recently, he’s been talking to the Red Sox to see if he could sing his 100th performance at Fenway Park to help commemorate the 100th anniversary of the historic ballpark.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
Yesterday, we took a look at the women’s semifinal matchups. Now, it's on to the finals: fencing’s Alexandra Kiefer against soccer’s Mel Baskind.
Check back tomorrow when we pit the winners of the men’s and women’s sides to determine The Back Page Athlete of 2011. 
Alexandra Kiefer v. Mel Baskind
Both sophomore foil Alexandra Kiefer and senior Mel Baskind had unprecedented, historic 2011 seasons.
In her rookie season, Kiefer won 78.3 percent of her matchups, and in the biggest tournament of the year, the then-freshman shined, tallying 18 victories at the NCAA Fencing Championship en route to the individual NCAA Foil title.
Baskind, a two-sport standout and captain, had a 2011 to remember as well. After earning a first-team All-Ivy accolade in lacrosse in the spring, the senior dominated the soccer pitch in the fall, winning the Ivy League MVP while leading her squad to an Ivy title.
It’s a close one, but in a tournament to determine the best athlete, it’s hard not to give the nod to the woman at the top of her game not in one but two different arenas.
WINNER: Mel Baskind

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON, Mass.—With Boston-area bragging rights and the chance to play for a midseason title on the line, the first-round Beanpot matchup between the No. 7/8 Harvard women’s hockey team and crosstown rival Boston University was expected to be a physical one. But the 5-2 Terrier victory Tuesday night at Walter Brown Arena surpassed even conventional rivalry standards.
In the first period alone, the two teams combined for six penalties—three on each side—including three body-checking violations. After the first 20 minutes, the Crimson  (14-7-1, 11-4-1 ECAC) settled down physically, while the Terriers (15-12-1, 9-7-0 WHEA) continued to amass trips to the box, ending the game with a grand total of 11 penalties as a team, led by Kathryn Miller’s four.
“The biggest thing [for us Tuesday night] was our penalty kill,” BU coach Brian Derochers said. “We put pressure on them, and it probably demoralized them a little bit.”
BU netted two goals in the first period, forcing Harvard to start the second in a deep hole. Perhaps not surprisingly, the power play figured prominently in the game.
Terriers senior Jill Cardella put away the first goal of the game at 6:30 in the first, stealing the puck on a Crimson power play and giving her team an early lead with the short-handed goal. At 12:36, BU struck again after three Harvard penalties in fewer than two minutes gave the Terriers a two-man advantage.
The Crimson eventually capitalized on BU’s physical miscues at 11:34 in the third, with freshman defenseman Sarah Edney netting the first of two Harvard goals on a two-man advantage. Junior forward Jillian Dempsey followed suit at 15:09 to pull the Crimson within three. But it was too late for Harvard to stage a comeback.
SECOND BUT DEADLY
Although the Terriers outshot  the Crimson by an impressive 19-4 margin in the first period, the game was won during the second. Harvard attempted 27 shots in the middle frame, but 13 of those shots were blocked by the BU defense. And of the 14 that made it through, only nine found the face of the goal.
“Everyone just put their body in front of the puck,” BU forward Jenn Wakefield said. “We tried to minimize their [opportunities] and hopefully not get pucks through so there would be no chance for a tip or a rebound.”
The Terriers, on the other hand, placed eight of their 13 shots on net, with the Crimson tallying just one block in the period. Three shots made it past Harvard junior goaltender Laura Bellamy—who tallied 33 saves on the night—during the middle frame, giving BU a commanding five-goal edge going into the third.
“I thought our [team defense] was great,” Derocher said. “The power plays started to add up. We had six over two periods, and that meant we were keeping pucks away from the net and we were clearing pucks. Overall, it was pretty darn good, but you can’t keep playing this game five against four.”
The Crimson regained the momentum from the BU offense in the final period, placing 14 shots on target and outscoring the Terriers, 2-0.
BOSTON’S BEST
This year’s Beanpot boasts one of the strongest fields in tournament history, featuring three teams currently ranked in the top-10 nationally.
“The great thing about the Beanpot now is that all four teams are pretty darn good,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “[BC is] in the national rankings, so we have an opportunity to compete against a nationally ranked team [in the consolation round].”
Although BU entered its first Beanpot matchup as the only one of the four Boston-area schools without a national ranking, the Terriers saw time on the list—as high up as the No. 2 spot—earlier this season. And in its last three games, BU has taken down all three other Beanpot competitors, notching wins against BC and Northeastern last weekend.
“[BU] will be [nationally ranked] next week,” Stone said. “This place has evolved to a point where this is an awfully competitive tournament.”
The game between the Crimson and the Terriers was not the only upset of the day. Minutes before the Harvard game began, No. 6/7 Northeastern defeated No. 4 Boston College in overtime, pitting the two teams with lower national rankings against each other in the finals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Another comeback, another tie. These have been recurring trends for the Harvard men’s hockey team this season, and the Crimson continued them Tuesday night at the Bright Hockey Center.
Playing its third game in five days, Harvard overcame a two-goal deficit to earn a 2-2 tie against Dartmouth. A late third-period goal off of a power play extended a team record of nine draws in a single season, one shy of the NCAA record.
"It’s another tough game, tough tie," Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. "But after being down 2-0 and being down one going into the third, I really liked our response…. We’re disappointed on one side because we would like to get the goal to get us ahead, but from an effort standpoint I thought the kids really played hard and battled."
The Big Green (9-9-3, 6-6-2 ECAC) had originally gone up two goals in an 18-second span early in the second period, scoring on a power play and on the ensuing shift.
After cutting the lead in half late in the second, Harvard (6-6-9, 5-4-7) pulled even with around seven minutes remaining in the game.
Junior Danny Biega swung the puck towards the net from the right point, and junior Marshall Everson was able to direct the deflection from Dartmouth defenseman Jim Gaudet towards freshman forward Colin Blackwell, who easily sent the puck into the back of the open net on the left side.
"It was just kind of like a broken play," Blackwell said. "I was in the right place at the right time."
After Dartmouth stopped the Crimson on its previous three power plays, it was only natural that the most efficient power play team in the nation—which converts 31.8 percent of its chances, on pace to become the 17th best in history—finally put one in on the man-advantage.
"They clogged up the neutral zone pretty well," Blackwell said. "Their goalie stopped the puck around the net a bunch of times, and we finally got a chance to settle down and play with a little more emotion and a little more poise with the puck."
The game continued to overtime, in which both teams exchanged shots but no real strong scoring chances materialized, ending the game in yet another draw for the Crimson. It was also the ninth time in 14 games this season that Harvard has come back from a third-period deficit to either tie or win.
The game was physical throughout, right up until the very end when junior Luke Greiner, who scored the teams first goal, took a huge hit from Dartmouth defenseman Connor Goggin. The hit, which occured with under two seconds remaining in the game, ended up being called a charge.
"It was a pretty courageous play by Luke to hang in there to try to get the puck to the front of the net," Donato said. "The whole game was pretty physical. It looked like two teams that were battling pretty hard to get the extra point."
The first period was for the most part uneventful on the offensive side, as the Crimson’s blocking and hard hits prevented any Big Green opportunities. And with only one shot on the power play, the home team was outshot, 7-6, in the opening frame.
Midway through the period, freshman Patrick McNally was able to wrap around the net and throw it across the crease to freshman Tommy O’Reagan, but Dartmouth goalie Jody O’Neill was there to stuff the forward’s shot.
Around seven minutes into the second, Big Green freshman Brandon McNally was able to capitalize on a rebound on a shot initially stopped by Harvard freshman goaltender Steve Michalek, who had 29 saves on the night.
Dartmouth forward Alex Goodship then scored 18 seconds later on a fortuitous bounce in front of the right side of the Harvard goal.
Donato noted this wasn’t the first time his team had given up goals in such a short span.
"To give them up [on] back-to-back shifts, that hurts," he said. "We’ve got to find a way to have a good response to a goal against. It’s something we need to manage a lot better."
The Crimson started its comeback late in the second. Greiner redirected junior Brendan Rempel’s initial shot from the center point after senior Eric Kroshus was able to win the puck on the left boards and pass it across the blue line.
Having scored late in the last two games to pull out victories against both Yale and Brown, Harvard had a chance to make it three in a row.
"I think we felt that we were going to be able to find a way to win the game, which is a nice positive feeling," Donato said. "Guys were pushing. It looked like we were going to get some chances."
But despite ending the game knotted up at two apiece, the Crimson continued a five-game unbeaten streak and was able to earn a point in the ECAC standings, placing it in a tie for third with Colgate.

BOSTON, Mass.—The No. 7/8 Harvard women’s hockey team lost, 5-2, to Boston University on Tuesday at the Walter Brown Arena in Boston, Massachusetts.
The Crimson fell short in the final round of the Beanpot last season and was looking to get off to a strong start in the first round of the Beanpot against a quality opponent.
“It’s a pride game—there is no question about it,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said.
The Terriers (15-12-1, 9-7 WHEA) were seeking to end a 31-year Beanpot tropy drought, while the Crimson  (14-7-1, 11-4-1 ECAC) was looking to add number 14 to its collection of tournament wins.
Harvard’s hopes for a title were rocked early, as BU got off to a fast start and controlled the puck for a majority of the opening minutes.
After Terriers freshman Caroline Campbell earned a penalty for tripping, Harvard looked poised to take advantage of the opportunity.
But BU stayed aggressive. Senior Tara Watchorn got control of the puck in the Crimson zone and slid it to junior Jill Cordella, who fired a shot past Harvard goaltender junior Laura Bellamy through the five hole to give the Terriers a 1-0 advantage just over six minutes into the contest.
“I think we were out of sync a bit at the beginning of the game with personnel, and that shorthanded goal takes the wind out of your sails a bit,” Stone said. “Also, BU did an excellent job of killing penalties all night.”
Then the Crimson got sloppy and started committing penalties. Junior Kelsey Romatoski went to the box for slashing, and freshman Sarah Edney  joined her for tripping only 63 seconds later, giving Harvard the tough task of killing a 5-on-3 power play.
The Crimson initially did a good job of limiting BU’s shots. But shortly after Romatoski’s return, Harvard faced another setback when junior Josephine Pucci was called for body checking.
The Terriers were able to control the puck on the long 5-on-3 and swing it around the perimeter, looking for opportunities. One opened as senior Kasey  Boucher shuffled a pass to sophomore Kaleigh Fratkin who fired a well-placed slap shot past Bellamy’s left shoulder into the goal.
The score gave BU a 2-0 lead with seven minutes remaning in the opening frame.
The Crimson seemed to be off to a better start in the second period, but the Terriers controlled the puck early and sophomore Marie-Phillip Poulin made it a three-goal game off a well placed backhand after a pass from sophomore Louise Warren.
BU was able to stretch the lead when junior Isabel Menard rifled a shot past Bellamy on the left side of the goal, giving the Terriers a dominant 4-0 lead with just under two minutes remaining in the second period.
BU did not take its foot off the gas, as freshman Caroline Campbell got away on a fast break. After the rookie lost the puck, teammate  senior Jenn Wakefield corralled it right in front of the net and slipped a shot over the shoulder of the keeper with nine seconds remaining in the period.
Despite the large deficit, Harvard wanted to close out the game on a high note with a strong third period.
“After the second period we were down, 5-0, and at that point you can either crumble or turn it around the other way,” Pucci said. “We really wanted to come together at the end of that period. We wanted to make sure the third was the best period we could play.”
The Crimson did just that, as its aggressive play led to five BU penalties in the final frame.
Harvard, which had many chances all night but was unable to finish, was finally able to get on the board when Sarah Edney put away a rebound in front of the net with just under 10 minutes remaining in the game.
The Crimson cut the lead to three when junior Jillian Dempsey scored another power-play goal with just fewer than five minutes remaining.
“We just got ourselves together in the third period,” Stone said. “We got back to the things that we did well and kept it simple and helped each other out. And we were able to capitalize on two power plays.”
Harvard though was unable to make the game any closer and ultimately fell, 5-2.
The Crimson will look to get revenge on No. 4 Boston College, who defeated them in the final last year, in the Consolation game on Feb. 7th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
After crowning the champion of the women’s bracket yesterday, it’s the moment we've all been waiting for: Andrew Campbell of the rowing team and Mel Baskind of the lacrosse and soccer teams meet in the overall final to determine The Back Page Athlete of 2011. 
The final matchup between Andrew Campbell and Melanie Baskind raises an interesting question. What is more impressive: the elite race results Campbell has achieved on the water or the outstanding performances Baskind from Baskind on both the soccer and lacrosse fields?
Given that he competed in the lightweight single, Campbell's accomplishments are best expressed by the actual results he has achieved. His wins at the US U23 World Championships Trials (by a margin of over 30 seconds), Elite Nationals, US World Championship Trials, and USRowing East Coast Fall Speed Orders speak for themselves. So do his bronze medal at the U23 World Rowing Championships and his fourth-place finish at the senior World Rowing Championships.
As a member of teams, Baskind's accomplishments are naturally less quantifiable than Campbell's. As a midfielder in both soccer and lacrosse, her contributions to the team go beyond her stat line. Though with 34 points in lacrosse and 24 points and three game-winning goals in soccer, her numbers are impressive. As a co-captain of both the soccer and lacrosse teams, she was a driving force behind the two teams' successes: an Ivy title in soccer and a trip to the Ivy League championship game in lacrosse.
The honors poured in for both sports. Baskind was a first-team All Ivy selection in both soccer and lacrosse, and was unanimously voted Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer. She also received several academic honors and was named a finalist for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award.
So when one combines her accomplishments in both soccer and lacrosse, where does Baskind land? As one of the most impressive athletes in the country? Potentially. As the one of the best in the world? No.
As his race results indicate, Campbell was the top U.S. lightweight sculler this year and one of the top scullers in the world. His bronze medal at U23 worlds marked the highest finish the U.S. has ever seen in that event. And the U.S. hadn't placed so highly in the lightweight single at senior worlds since 2002.
His groundbreaking finishes at two world championships and undefeated record in national single competitions earned him the USRowing Man of the Year Award. As impressive as Harvard's athletes have been this year, none can match the performance of Andrew Campbell. And for that, he is the Back Page's Athlete of 2011.

When Corinne H. Curcie '15 and Katherine J. Zhou '15 heard that CS164: "Mobile Software Engineering" might be lotteried, they decided to take preemptive action. The result is Super Malan, a video parody of Nicki Minaj's "Super Bass."
"We thought it might persuade Malan that we really wanted to be in the class," Curcie said of David J. Malan '99.
The two conceived of the idea for this video after many late nights singing and coding their final project for Malan's most popular course, CS50. Though their project ROFLRomance—"a dating site for the socially-inept"—wasn't as functional as they had hoped, they emerged from the process with the lyrics for this song. Embedded throughout the video are references to their experiences in CS50, which Curcie acknowledged is "pretty much a cult."
Curcie and Zhou credit assistant head teaching fellow Robert T. Bowden '13 and the other CS50 TFs for making the class such a positive experience.
"You spend hours with them at office hours with your classmates. You really get to know so many people through CS50," Curcie said.
So what does Malan think about all of this?
"Well, he liked it on my Facebook wall," Curcie said.
Since CS164 ended up not being lotteried this year, Curcie and Zhou, both intended computer science concentrators, successfully enrolled.
"We were hoping he'd play it in class, but he just played part of Super Bass. It was definitely a nod though," Curcie said of lecture on Monday afternoon.
CORRECTION: Feb. 1, 2012.
An earlier version of this blog post referred to Robert T. Bowden '13 as the head teaching fellow for CS50. In fact, he was the assistant head teaching fellow of the fall course. As well, the article incorrectly referred to the course title of CS164. In fact, it is "Mobile Software Engineering."

Harvard graduates have been infiltrating NBC's primetime writing scene since Al Franken '73 first landed his "Saturday Night Live" writing gig in 1975. Those that followed Franken have included James "Jim" M. Downey '74, Conan C. O'Brien '85, B.J. Novak '01, and an insufferable slew of comedic know-it-all's from the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
These "hyper intelligent Harvard boys"—as Tina Fey once referred to them—dominate the writing staff of nearly all NBC shows, including Fey's own sitcom "30 Rock," a show about NBC writers. With five Harvard graduates on its writing staff, "30 Rock" has never hesitated to make fun of the University.
Season one, episode two introduces the character James "Toofer" Spurlock, a fictional Harvard grad. According to Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy, he is nicknamed "Toofer" because "with him you get a two-for-one; he's a black guy and a Harvard guy."
At another point Jack Donaghy refers to Toofer's going to Harvard, saying, "So we know that he's smart and superb at masturbation."
And in season four Toofer tells Fey's character, Liz Lemon, "I'm about to say two words a Harvard man would never say," to which Liz Lemon jokingly interrupts, "I'm cool?"
In the full-blown Crimson episode "Secrets and Lies," former Harvard Lampooner Ron Weiner '95 adds an entire subplot where Toofer and another writer feud over Toofer's status as a Harvard alum.
Occasionally the Harvard stereotype just makes fun of itself. When Toofer attempts to quit his job at TGS, the faux NBC show for which he writes, he tells Liz, "I'm off. With my degree I can always go into architecture or medical nanotechnology." When Liz, confused, asks him what his college major was, Toofer responds, "Sorry I don't understand—Oh, I see. At Harvard we call them 'concentrations.'"
Toofer also pulls the eerily accurate modesty card, making every effort to avoid speaking of his education. "You know I went to school in Boston," he says. "Well, not in Boston, but nearby. No, not Tufts."
But, for once, the most recent Harvard reference in last week's episode has nothing to do with Toofer. Liz's new boyfriend calls Wesleyan "the Harvard of central Connecticut," to which Liz replies, "No, Yale is the Harvard of central Connecticut."
That's also debatable, Liz Lemon. That's also debatable.
