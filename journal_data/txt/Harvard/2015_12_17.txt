After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This holiday season, dinner table conversations will center on family traditions, gift-giving, and divisive current events. These discussions will be particularly  exhausting for students affected by debates over the displacement of Syrian refugees, racist police brutality, institutional racism, and student activism—especially when these debates take place with folks who aren’t affected or empathetic.
For many who have been directly affected by recent events, going home can be a disembodying change of culture and environment. The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’s placemats help students navigate these difficult conversations. This semester, students have experienced the defacement of black professors’ portraits at Harvard Law School, resistance to changing the titles of what were formerly referred to as Harvard House masters, rampant Islamophobia in politics, and student activism. It is difficult and daunting to explain one’s convictions and actions to family members, especially for first-generation Harvard students who represent “the voice of Harvard.”
By giving students the tools to engage in these conversations, the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is supporting the people for whom this is relevant. Upholding its mission to   “foster understanding, community and belonging,” this office is simply doing its job.
Some accuse the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion of indoctrination, but the views on the placements come from students views, not administrators. Earlier this year, Latinx students issued a number of demands, including that Harvard change the title of its House heads, after police assaulted a delegate to the annual Latinx Ivy League Conference in November. Black students recently led a rally in solidarity with activists at Yale and the University of Missouri. Last year, black students led marches, demonstrations, and die-ins in protest of racist police brutality. Muslim and Arab American students continue to speak out and organize against Islamophobia and exclusion at Harvard and beyond.
The administration isn’t proselytizing students. With the placemats, it is simply listening to concerns raised by students  of color, Muslim students, and other minority students who have rallied, made art, written op-eds, and made their voices heard on these issues. Harvard students have the agency to read the placemats and disagree with their positions, but they ring true to many. This is a minor token of institutional support for racial justice, and it shouldn’t be controversial for Harvard’s administration to affirm the humanity of black, Latinx, Arab, Muslim, and other minority students. The value of black lives, Latinx lives, and Muslim lives is not debatable—at the holiday dinner table, at Harvard, or anywhere else.
For many, going home is not only a break from Harvard but also a reminder of the different worlds, environments, and social networks students occupy beyond campus. While the Harvard administration owes much more to students of color, Muslim students, and other minority students, the placemat distributed by the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity acknowledges and addresses their concerns about the winter holiday. Producing and distributing this placemat validates students at a time that can be difficult and uncomfortable to navigate.
In spite of the season’s cheer, winter’s holiday dinners can be draining and difficult for  students forced to explain themselves, Harvard, and controversial events. Rather than condemning these placemats, we must recognize that Harvard is serving students for whom these conversations are personal rather than political.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College administrators apologized for the creation and distribution of controversial placemats that advise students on how to discuss topics of race and diversity with family members, saying the materials failed to respect principles of academic freedom.
In an email sent to undergraduates on Wednesday night, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 wrote that while they believed the guide had well-intentioned goals, it was “not effectively presented” and “failed to account for the many viewpoints that exist on our campus.”
“On behalf of the Office of Student Life and the Freshman Dean’s Office, we offer our sincere apologies for this situation,” they wrote, acknowledging that they had received feedback on the placemats in the few days since their distribution. 
University President Drew G. Faust also criticized the placemats in an interview Thursday, calling the initiative “a really bad idea.”
“I don’t think the University should be directing people—students, staff, faculty—what to say or what to think,” Faust said. “The University is a place that ought to foster robust discussion and disagreement, and welcome all perspectives, and that did not seem to be consistent with the message of the placemats.”
The placemats offer hypothetical answers to four controversial issues, including student activism on college campuses, the recently announced title change for Harvard’s “House Masters,” and the possible entrance of Syrian refugees into the United States. In response to one hypothetical question, “Why are Black students complaining?” the placemat suggests that undergraduates respond by saying “When I hear students expressing their experiences on campus I don’t hear complaining.”
In an interview earlier this week, Dingman—whose office produced the placemats in collaboration with the College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion—lauded them as a platform to start “constructive dialogue” about race.
But several undergraduates, including more than a dozen Undergraduate Council representatives, swiftly criticized the placemats, which administrators distributed in a number of campus dining halls.
The Harvard Republican Club posted a parody of the placemats on their Facebook page on Tuesday with the heading “Holiday Placemat for Common Sense.” Mimicking the original placemats, the document maintains the same four-category layout but instead includes statements such as “I’ve printed out some convenient political opinions to have and share with your parents!” along with suggested responses to the statements. The document argues that College administrators should not pressure undergraduates into taking a singular stance on controversial topics.
Eighteen UC representatives also co-signed a letter on Wednesday criticizing the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion for disseminating what they called “party-line talking points” that stand in contrast to the College’s mission of open debate.
“We do not think the offices of the university should be in the business of disseminating ‘approved’ positions on complex and divisive political issues,” the letter says.
UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 wrote in an emailed statement on behalf  of himself and UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 that the pair “fully support” the UC members’ opposition to the placemats, despite their own decision against signing the letter. Still, Banks wrote that the pair believed administrators’ intention was to “start dialogue” on topics of diversity.
Aaron I. Henricks ’16, former president of the Harvard Republican Club, said he was “pleased that the administration was so responsive to many students standing up for common sense and openness in our discourse at Harvard.”
In their email to undergraduates, Lassonde and Dingman wrote that they view academic freedom as “central” to the College. Lassonde declined to comment beyond the content of his Wednesday night email. Dingman did not respond to request for comment.
