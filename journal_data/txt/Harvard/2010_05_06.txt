After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past eight years, Harvard’s study abroad program has seen a dramatic expansion: what began with a small group of students who traveled overseas for a full semester has widened into a much larger component of the undergraduate population, most of whom spend a summer in a foreign country.
The number of participants in summer study abroad programs has increased 706 percent over the past eight years at Harvard. Current undergraduates attribute the spike in interest to an increase in opportunities for summer funding and concerns about missing campus life during the school year.
But a small, yet steadily increasing, number of undergraduates are willing to forfeit a semester in Cambridge for what they see as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity—and they say the University has taken steps to facilitate what is often seen as an intimidating planning process.
OUTSIDE THE ‘HARVARD BUBBLE’
Although the number of students who choose to study abroad for a full semester has increased 70 percent in the last eight years, Harvard’s study abroad statistics pale in comparison to those of some peer institutions.
In the previous academic year, 180 Harvard students spent a semester abroad. Meanwhile, Brown sent 488 students abroad for a semester—a ten-year low for the school.
Several factors discourage Harvard students from studying in a foreign country, including the fear of missing opportunities on campus, the financing of a trip abroad, and the lack of awareness of available programs.
Students who chose to study abroad say that when they revealed their plans to travel outside the country, their friends bombarded them with concerns about the opportunities and experiences they would miss back on campus.
But Odelia S. Younge ’11 says she ultimately decided such concerns were not enough to deter her from spending a semester studying in Madrid.
“I decided I’m always missing something wherever I am, and so that’s not a reason not to go,” Younge says.
Dana E. Seesel ’11, who spent the fall semester in Barcelona, says she agrees that while students may miss life back in Cambridge, the experience spent abroad is nevertheless worthwhile.
“While you’re over there, you miss the people here, Harvard Square, and your professors,” Seesel says. “But now when you’re back, you miss Barcelona.”
Director of the Office of International Programs Catherine H. Winnie says that in recent years, faculty and administrators have encouraged this view.
“There was an emphasis on the importance of students getting direct experience living abroad and so students were encouraged to go abroad,” Winnie says.
Despite the University’s willingness to have students study abroad, several students say that those who want to travel have to be proactive and self-motivated when devising their plans.
“Harvard doesn’t discourage, but I wouldn’t say it always encourages us to go abroad,” Younge says.
The success of a student’s time in a foreign country is largely based upon the personal initiative taken before the trip, according to Alexandra M. Wilcox ’11.
“The programs are there but they are not publicized or encouraged, so many people don’t know about them,” Wilcox says.
FACILITATING THE TRIP
Winnie could not point to one specific change that has inspired more students to go abroad, but she notes a changing attitude on campus that encourages students to take advantage of the available opportunities.
The simplification of the paperwork and credit transfer processes has also aided student interest, according to Winnie.
“With the support of faculty and advisors, the Office of International Programs streamlined the process for students to get credit,” Winnie says.
The University has recently been able to increase financing for students studying abroad over the summer—formerly a major factor in students’ decisions about studying abroad.
Hamida B. Owusu ’10, who spent a semester at the University of Ghana, says that it was more financially feasible for her to study abroad during the semester, when her financial aid would directly transfer to subsidize the costs of her program.
Moreover, the 2008 donation of the David Rockefeller International Experience Grants provided Harvard additional funds to spend on summer study abroad.
“With the arrival of the David Rockefeller gift, it became possible for students to go abroad in the summer, when there is no financial aid,” Winnie says.
In a process often facilitated by the OIP, students who decide to go abroad are faced with many options regarding the use of their time: they can take courses for academic credit, work in a foreign laboratory, or research for a senior thesis.
The OIP keeps records of every program attended by a Harvard student, along with a thorough review by the student. Individuals may choose between a selection of Harvard programs and Harvard-approved programs that are run by other universities or organizations, or they may suggest their own programs.
“The list on our website is a historical list, time-tested programs that Harvard has used and had good reports on, and it has a wonderful array of options,” Winnie says.
Though many students say they were initially worried about adjusting their concentration requirements to fit into their study abroad schedules, they found their departments to be accommodating and flexible.
Younge, a History and Literature concentrator with a focus on America, says that she was surprised by the eagerness of her concentration advisor to help ensure that Younge could fit her study abroad into her four-year academic schedule.
“I couldn’t have asked for a nicer relationship, both when I was abroad and when I came back,” Younge says.
TAKING MORE TIME
Students say that the difference between an eight-week summer and a four-month semester consists of more than a variance in duration.
Studying abroad over the summer is substantially more popular than going overseas during the semester, but students who stayed abroad for a full semester say that they felt as though they made a substantive transition from being a long-term tourist to a resident of the city, integrated into the culture and the personality of their new home.
“After four months you really feel like you belong,” Seesel says.
Students taking a semester abroad are often able to explore far more than their host city. Wilcox, who stayed in Barcelona with Seesel for the same program, says that they traveled from their base in Barcelona to Rome, London, Istanbul, Morocco, and London—trips they certainly would not have taken had they been in Barcelona for a mere eight weeks.
Some study abroad programs include local travel as an integral part of the student’s experience. The Council on International Educational Exchange in Ghana—a Harvard-approved program—sponsors trips to different parts of the country every two to three weeks during a semester.
Students who undertook full semester trips away from Cambridge, despite the perceived drawbacks, unanimously say that their experiences were the highlights of their Harvard career.
“It really did re-invigorate me about why I’m studying, why I’m at Harvard, and where I want my studies to take me,” Owusu says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University Committee on Human Rights Studies, which was established a decade ago to unite various human rights efforts across the University, will dissolve on June 30, University Provost Steven E. Hyman announced Wednesday.
UCHRS will be replaced by a smaller human rights directorate responsible for University-wide coordination and communication on human rights, Hyman wrote in an e-mailed statement.
The group will consist of directors of the three human rights centers at Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard School of Public Health.
With the restructuring of the committee—which had focused on the development of undergraduate courses—human rights education will become the responsibility of the Ethnic Studies Committee, an interdisciplinary collection of faculty that introduced a secondary degree in Ethnic Studies this year.
Since its inception, UCHRS sought to integrate human rights activities into the “Harvard mainstream,” according to current UCHRS director Jacqueline Bhabha, who will assume the post of University Advisor on Human Rights Education on the new directorate.
Bhabha said that she views the decision to disperse the committee’s activities throughout the University as “a confirmation that we have succeeded in doing what we set out to do—which was to institutionalize a basis that can go forward on its own within the University.”
In addition to its mission of University-wide collaboration, the UCHRS offers a variety of research grants and runs Scholars at Risk, a fellowship program that invites scholars who are at risk of persecution in their native countries to Harvard. The new directorate will assume control of the program.
Because both HLS and HKS are still currently conducting searches for directors of their respective human rights centers, Hyman has entrusted the HSPH François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights with leading University-wide human rights initiatives in the coming year.
The UCHRS budget was in the hundreds of thousands, according to Bhaba, who does not credit the closure to current budgetary pressures throughout the University.
“I think that the funding crunch certainly concentrated the mind on rationalizing the way that many University-wide faculty things worked,” Bhabha said. “But it is difficult to say the counter-factual...It wasn’t actually that we were running out of money.”
Because the two staff members who currently work at UCHRS had already made plans to depart, no staff positions will be lost as a result of the human rights committee’s closure, according to Hyman.
“The existing Centers and programs are now poised to continue the collaborative spirit that you spearheaded and Jackie [Bhabha] modeled in her leadership of UCHRS,” Hyman wrote.
“Congratulations on a job well done,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A novel administrative structure that streamlines staff workload by consolidating staff workers into a centralized body may expand next year to include more departments within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The two-year pilot program aims to reduce the cost of staffing departments by having one individual perform the same function for many departments—in comparison to having various staffers perform analogous functions within their respective departments.
The pilot program will fall under the direct administration of the Social Sciences next year, allowing departments from across the division to take part.
Currently, the departments of History and History of Science share staff support after a merger in November. The merged administrative body was formed to adjust to reduced staff numbers in the aftermath of last year’s layoffs and early retirement program.
“This could be the model for the future,” said History of Science Chair Anne Harrington ’82 of the pilot program.
Economics Chair John Y. Campbell said it was too early to know whether his department would take part in the program in the coming semester since the budget will only be finalized by the end of the month. But he acknowledged that “it’s an idea.”
In an e-mailed statement, FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote that the merged administrative group has already helped to reduce costs in the face of an FAS deficit that currently stands at $80 million.
“Despite already reducing the projected budget deficit for the coming fiscal year by more than $100 million, [FAS Dean Michael D. Smith] has indicated that we still have much more to accomplish,” Neal wrote. “Sharing administrative services more broadly across departments is one area under consideration.”
Currently, five staffers located at offices at 17 Sumner Road manage the finances and provide staff support for the History and History of Science departments. The two departments shared salary costs this year, but the Social Sciences Division will cover salaries and pay for the facility next year, eliminating the financial burden from the departments’ budgets.
According to the division’s administrative manager Jessica A. Glasser, the remote location has meant more traveling around campus to pick up documents and meet with faculty members.
But Glasser said that centralized support staff could be of service across various departments because of what she described as “generic job descriptions.”
The idea for the staff merger emerged last year when the History and History of Science departments lost eight of the two departments’ total 28 staff workers.
One of those staffers was stationed at the Center for European Studies, where the staff member served History faculty with offices at the CES. Now, the administrative group serves those faculty members, some of whom have expressed concern about the elimination of the staff position.
“She works like a demon. She works too hard,” said History Professor Patrice Higonnet, who works in CES and said his staff assistant supports 17 other faculty members.
“That’s a problem,” Higonnet added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I, Part II, and Part III of this story appeared on April 30, May 3, and May 5, 2010.)
Sexual assault can happen anywhere. But, fairly or unfairly, when predatory sexual behavior at Harvard is discussed, the conversation often turns to the all-male final clubs, whose parties are known for their free-flowing alcohol and lack of administrative supervision.
Members of the Phoenix S.K. Club say they are struggling to overcome what some suggest is a less than sterling reputation.
“All it takes is one person, one story, one twisted account of a story to scar an entire group of people,” says Phoenix member Daniel A. Sack ’10.
While it is difficult to ascertain the degree to which male final clubs are associated with the cases of sexual assault that take place on Harvard’s campus, many students and administrators say that the conditions at club parties create an environment conducive to sexual assault.
Some of the clubs, including the Phoenix, have taken tangible steps to improve women’s safety, such as working with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, or Harvard Men Against Rape. But many students and administrators say that more work remains to make the final clubs—which host a substantial share of the parties attended by Harvard undergraduates—safer spaces.
‘HAVE A DRINK WITH ME’
After a stressful week, many students who are looking to let loose and party head to final clubs.
Some partygoers are hoping to hook up, while others are just there to dance. But sometimes, what starts out as an innocent evening spent enjoying the company of one’s peers can take a turn for the worse.
One night, Laura—a Harvard undergraduate whose name has been changed to protect her privacy—attended a list-only party at the Spee Club.
Throughout the night, she says, she felt constant pressure to keep drinking. The party had an ice luge for shots, and attendees were playing drinking games.
“Guys were always saying to me, ‘Have a drink with me.’ ‘Take a shot with me,’” she says.
Though she never “blacked out,” Laura steadily became more intoxicated as the night progressed.
“I was really, really drunk and this guy was giving me drinks,” she says. “He ended up taking me upstairs. We ended up having sex.”
At the time, she says, she consented to having sex. But she adds, “It’s not something I would have done if I wasn’t drunk.”
In retrospect, Laura believes that she was more intoxicated than the club member appeared to be, and she is unsure how to label the incident.
“I’m not sure how much I should be bothered by it,” she says. “Honestly, my own conception of final clubs was this kind of thing happens all the time.”
Laura has not returned to the club since that night.
Regardless of whether what happened to her constitutes sexual assault, Laura says, the situation is representative of what she sees as a larger problem with the male-dominated social scene.
“They have control over the atmosphere of the party, they have control over the final club, they have control over the alcohol, and then they let in all of these drunk girls,” she says.
Because the members of all-male final clubs control not only the spaces where parties take place, but also the guests who are admitted and the distribution and consumption of alcohol, many women have expressed concern that clubs create an environment of misogyny that is a catalyst for sexual assault.
“The perception is that final clubs foster sexual assault through being environments where people drink a lot in unmonitored ways with little or no supervision of any kind, “ says Assistant Dean of Students Susan B. Marine, who is also the director of the Harvard College Women’s Center.
WHO’S RESPONSIBLE?
Marine, who was the founding director of OSAPR, says she has received few reports of sexual assault from final clubs.
It is difficult to accurately determine where sexual assaults take place on campus. Only one or two sexual assault cases go before the Administrative Board—the College’s primary disciplinary body—each year, but national statistics indicate that as many as 25 percent of women have been sexually assaulted by the time they graduate from college.
According to OSAPR Director Sarah A. Rankin, “recently gathered statistics” collected by her office show that 70 percent of sexual assaults occurred off campus, 20 percent took place on campus, and 10 percent happened at an unknown location.
“We consider ‘off campus’ to be any location outside of Harvard property, including but not limited to final clubs,” she writes in an e-mailed statement.
In an e-mail, former Dean of Harvard College Benedict H. Gross ’71 writes that it was impossible to detect any trend as to where sexual assaults occurred during his tenure.
“It’s what we call in math ‘the law of small numbers,’” he writes. “There weren’t enough cases to make any sensible statistics.”
Further adding to the difficulty, while sexual assaults may not take place at clubs, they may involve individuals leaving the clubs. And members of clubs say that each has different policies, cultures, and leadership, meaning that it is difficult to make sweeping statements about sexual assaults and final clubs.
While members of the Phoenix and a member of the Spee made themselves available to be interviewed for this story, members and presidents of most of Harvard’s remaining male final clubs—the Porcellian, the A.D., the Fly, the Fox, the Delphic, and the Owl—declined or did not respond to requests for comment.
Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” Ellison says he does not believe that final clubs are uniquely responsible for sexual assaults that happen on campus.
“I wouldn’t say the clubs, the fraternities or the sororities are the nexus of all our problems,” he says. “We’ve had problems from a Heaven and Hell party, from the Mather Lather, from the 80s dance.”
Instead, he says, places where students drink heavily may predict where sexual assaults will take place.
An average of 20 to 30 cases of sexual assault a year are reported to administrators, House officers, and specialists at OSAPR and University Health Services, and administrators say that the vast majority of them involve alcohol.
Phoenix president Byron T. Lichtenstein ’11 says he believes that the clubs are tied to the issue of sexual assault because the College depends on them to host parties for undergraduates.
“The clubs are a social space, and until Harvard has more social spaces there’s always going to be an association between the final clubs and being afraid of sexual assault,” he says.
PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
OSAPR Prevention Specialist Seth D. Avakian, who spends much of his time training men to be aware of and responsive to sexual assault, says that many final club members have become actively involved in improving safety at their clubs.
“The overwhelming majority of the guys in final clubs want to be able to throw a fun party where people don’t get hurt,” Avakian writes in an e-mailed statement.
Lichtenstein says that the club generally keeps upstairs bedroom doors locked, in part to prevent members from having sex in them, and members are fined if they bring non-family members upstairs.
Lichtenstein, who works with OSAPR and conducts Sex Signals training for freshmen, says that the club mandates that all drinks be poured out in the open and into empty glasses. Two Phoenix members participate in DAPA, he says.
But Lichtenstein notes that there is little consistency in prevention efforts from club to club.
Unlike some other final clubs, the Spee does not bar women from certain parts of their multi-million dollar buildings, according to Undergraduate Council President Johnny F. Bowman ’11, a member of the club.
“Women in the club are allowed everywhere men are, so there are no secret spaces,” he writes in an e-mailed statement. “Other things like the culture of the club and our membership are the strongest preventative measures but are the least tangible.”
On a more concrete level, many club members have become involved with OSAPR and HMAR.
Lichtenstein says that five out of eight male final clubs participate in OSAPR’s final club advisory committee, but a club’s dedication may vary from year to year depending on membership and leadership.
Avakian writes that OSAPR is working on instituting sexual assault prevention training in every final club, but challenges remain in ensuring that every member is present for training. But some final clubs have agreed to make training mandatory for new members as of next year—a practice he hopes will become universal among the clubs.
“If we’re getting guys to talk about these issues, we’re on our way to success,” he writes.
The main way to involve men in the fight against sexual assault, Avakian says, is to engage them as active bystanders who will step in when they see a potentially risky situation.
Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, founder of the MenSpeakUp website and a leader of OSAPR training sessions, says that it can be challenging to inspire people who care but remain silent to feel comfortable about taking an active stance.
“We need to find out how to get people to commit to action,” he says. “When you intervene, it almost always has an impact and almost always no harm comes to you.”
DEBATING DESEGREGATION
Many women and administrators say that desegregating the final clubs would help to improve both the safety and the reputations of the clubs.
“I think they do need to allow women in them,” Ellison says. “I do think they need to become more diverse and allow more members of the community, but I don’t have any control over that.”
While Lichtenstein says he opposes allowing women to join the Phoenix, he says the change would make the clubs safer for women.
“Just the fact that there would be equal members who could push each other to be gender-conscious would definitely help out,” Lichtenstein says.
Eva B. Rosenberg ’10, chair emerita of the feminist group Radcliffe Union of Students, refers to final clubs as “the last vestige of a dying heterosexist patriarchal racist order that has dominated Harvard for most of its nearly 400-year history.”
“A male-dominated social space is inherently inequitable and poses a particular risk for women,” Rosenberg says.
Though Rosenberg is critical of final clubs as institutions, she says she is optimistic about the surge in member participation in efforts against sexual assault.
“I hope that at the very least men working from inside that system share my belief that creating safe, inclusive, and equitable social space is an urgent priority here at Harvard,” she says.
A FEW BAD MEN
Despite the perception that sexual assault is rampant in final clubs, many agree that only a small minority of men is likely to commit sexual assaults.
“It’s such a tiny minority of men who do this. It’s not like we have these big bad clubs,” says Tamar Holoshitz ’10, who used to work with OSAPR. “You want to educate your organization and create an environment where people step up and people notice something going on and say something.”
Lichtenstein echoes Holoshitz’s comments.
“It’s a very small percentage of guys who are actually capable of it, and an even smaller percentage who even do it,” Lichtenstein says. “Every single club I know has one to two guys who are more sketchy than the rest of them. The measures are there for those one or two guys.”
Members say that the Phoenix tries to eliminate threatening members during punch—the final clubs’ process for selecting members.
Sack says that members ask themselves during punch, “Is this a guy who is going to be overly aggressive with girls?” as they want to avoid inducting members who will be a “liability” or “reflect poorly on the club.”
To protect both the clubs’ reputation and female guests, many members already connected to OSAPR or HMAR are trying to involve their fellow members.
“They come to a sincere realization that...they have the responsibility to stand up and do something,” Van Vuuren says. “We’re doing this so Harvard can be a safer place, so our community will be more intact, to protect the integrity of individuals in our community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard faculty recently discussed its current stance against allowing Google Books to scan the University’s vast collection of copyrighted material.
Over 30 professors and administrators from across the University gathered at the Charles Hotel on Wednesday in a closed meeting to discuss whether Harvard should sign a deal with Google Books, which would grant the web giant permission to scan and digitize the University’s materials and make them publicly accessible.
In October 2008, the University decided not to partner with Google, objecting to the terms of a $125 million settlement that Google reached with several publishing houses and the Authors Guild, which had sued for “massive” copyright infringement.
At the time of the 2008 settlement, University Spokesman John D. Longbrake said that Harvard might partner with Google Books if the terms of the settlement were revised to be more “reasonable.”
In 2009, the Department of Justice objected to Google’s settlement, expressing concerns that Google Books’ digitization project violated antitrust laws.
The case is currently being heard in New York City by Judge Denny Chin, but the process of reaching a settlement has been delayed.
But University Attorney Jonathan H. Hulbert said that Harvard’s decision need not hinge on the terms of the settlement, a position echoed by several others in attendance at Wednesday’s meeting.
“We may not want our thinking to be colored by the prospect of a settlement,” East Asian Languages and Civilizations Professor Peter K. Bol said.
At the meeting, University officials involved with the Google settlement reviewed Harvard’s history with Google Books and looked toward the future of a potential partnership.
In 2005, Harvard had agreed to scan 40,000 of its public domain holdings in a pilot program, contributing to the 12 million works Google Books has already digitized.
“How do we make information and knowledge most accessible with the least cost?”  Bol asked, identifying the overarching question of the meeting.
“We are trying to get an understanding of the state of play of the Google Books settlement,” said Bol, whose questions at the February Faculty Meeting instigated Wednesday’s gathering.
In February, Bol had asked, “What is Harvard’s rationale for not joining the settlement to date?”
University President Drew G. Faust, who said she did not receive prior notice of the question posed at February’s Faculty Meeting, still reaffirmed that the University is committed to open access, within the bounds of legality.
This discussion, Hulbert said, could “go on for a long time.”
Wednesday’s meeting brought together legal experts such as Hulbert and New York Law School Associate Professor James Grimmelmann, Harvard University Library Director Robert Darnton, member of the Library Implementation Group Deborah J. Weiss, and Director of the Office for Scholarly Communication Stuart M. Shieber.
It was an “exploratory discussion,” Darnton said of Wednesday’s gathering.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarifications:
CLARIFICATIONS: May 13, 2010
An earlier version of the May 6 news article "Harvard Considers Potential Partnership With Google Books" suggested that the University is "considering" a potential relationship with Google Books. To clarify, the meeting discussed in the article was an informal discussion centered around a status update on the Google Book Project lawsuit and settlement, according to University spokesman John Longbrake. The title has been changed to reflect the clarification.
The article also stated that Harvard had agreed to scan 40,000 of its public domain holdings in 2005. To clarify, this figure was part of the pilot project, and the public domain project has actually involved the scanning of hundreds of thousands of Harvard books.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the school year winds to a close, Michael Fucito ’09 is heating up on the soccer field just in time for summer.
A few weeks after the former Harvard soccer star saw time in his first professional contest on March 26 against Philadelphia, Fucito found the back of the net for the first time with the Sounders FC in the April 17 matchup against Kansas City.
The goal, which Fucito scored in the second minute of stoppage time, put Seattle up 1-0 as the whistle blew.
A throw in on the right flank from fellow midfielder Brad Evans found its way past the Wizards’ back line to Fucito, who skillfully tucked the ball behind the Kansas City goalkeeper, one-touch, from the top right corner of the 6-yard box. Video footage of the shot can be found here.
With the score, Fucito became the sixth MLS player of all time to have his first goal be a game-winner after at least 90 minutes of play.
The last time a player scored his first goal in stoppage time to hand his team a victory was in 2005. Needless to say, it’s quite an accomplishment.
Unfortunately, Fucito has been forced to sit out the last few games due to a knee injury. But upon his return, one should expect to see more great things from the former Crimson midfielder.

In an effort to raise public awareness concerning the DREAM Act and in order to get Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown’s attention, a group of three freshman students produced and filmed a public service announcement video.
Caitlin N. Lewis ’13, Ananda M. Martin-Caughey ’13, and Meredith C. Baker ’13 teamed up to work on a semester-long advocacy project, part of a requirement for Communications, Advocacy, and Public Affairs, a freshman seminar taught by Christine Heenan, Harvard’s Vice President for Office of Government, Community & Public Affairs.
The trio decided to highlight the stories of Harvard undergraduates and graduates who are illegal immigrants. Lewis had no idea what the DREAM Act was up until one evening, during dinner, one of her friends brought the subject up, she wrote in an e-mail to the Crimson.  She said she was surprised that Harvard alone admits 20 illegal immigrants, and that they end up with a world-class education but with, she said, nothing to do with it.
Even though the video was not a formal assignment for their seminar, the trio said they thought it would serve their goal of urging Senator Brown to support the DREAM Act, which was co-sponsored by the late Senator Ted Kennedy '54-'56.
The video contains real stories from the lives of undergraduates at Harvard and graduates from Harvard.  In an interview with his face in shadows, one graduate says, “For the last 15 years of my life, I’ve forgot what freedom means.” An undergraduate in the video says, “I was Mexican, and because of that I had no right to dream the dreams I was dreaming.” The video then urges viewers to write to senator Brown and to their congressmen in support of the DREAM Act.
Baker, Martin-Caughey, and Lewis expressed their aim to merge with the Harvard College Act on a DREAM group and help them with any activism-related activity next fall. Lewis said that she hopes that the DREAM Act would have passed by then.  If not, “We’ll be ready to continue advocating,” she said.

What have you finished, what do you have left, and how much time do you have?
I have one final paper left, and four other projects and presentations done. This is my shortest paper, just 15 pages!
What did you eat last?
I grabbed subway because it's fast.
When did you shower last?
This morning.
How many consecutive hours have you been awake? How many hours have you been in this spot?
So not counting last night, just over four hours. I took a break and went home this morning, napped three hours. [How long were you here last night?] Nine hours.
What's keeping you going?
Knowing that I'm going to graduate, and that this is the last thing in my way!
