After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you're lucky enough to have a significant other to impress this Valentine's Day, or if you simply need a break from the back-to-school rush, consider checking out an exhibit at one of the many art galleries around Boston and Cambridge. The Arts Blog has found four local galleries that are open to the public and free, so they're the perfect way to spend an afternoon if you've just dropped your last pennies on an Ec 10 book.
Maggie Tennesen at Mobilia Gallery
Maggie Tennesen's paintings are composed of straight lines and crosshatching in bold, complementary colors, with Asian symbols etched into the paint. Somewhat reminiscent of computer circuit boards or street maps, they inspire at once a sense of vibrant energy and inner peace. The gallery will be hosting a special reception with the artist on Saturday, February 16, from 3-5 p.m. On display until February 28; 358 Huron Avenue, Cambridge.
John Dempcy & Alicia Tormey at Chase Young Gallery
Both John Dempcy and Alicia Tormey use lively colors to blend science and nature in their paintings. While Dempcy's abstract pieces, composed of concentric drops of paint, evoke images of wildflowers, seashells, or even cells under a microscope, the networks of color in Tormey's landscapes and floral paintings are reminiscent of the nerves or capillaries in the human body. On display until  February 24; 450 Harrison Avenue, No. 57, Boston.
Visible Merge at Barbara Krakow Gallery
This exhibit features portraits by Frank Egloff and John Stezaker, both of whom combine multiple photographs in their pieces. Egloff's pieces use printers to overlay images on top of one another, producing a ghostly photo-negative effect, and Stezaker's disconcerting collages splice separate portraits into single images. On display until March 9; 10 Newbury Street, Boston.
Winter Residency at Gallery 263
Gallery 263's Artists-in-Residency program allows emerging local artists to use the gallery as a shared studio for a period of six weeks. The work produced by the artists during their term is then placed on display in the gallery for two more weeks. The current roster for the winter residency comprises three painters—Stephen Hamilton, Sirarpi Heghinian-Walzer, and Youngsheen Jhe—and photographer Pia Ward. On display from February 28 until March 9; 263 Pearl Street, Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Steven Soderbergh claims to be done—at least for the foreseeable future. At age 50, the prolific, protean director is tired of film, taking a hiatus to focus on painting. This choice is but one of many surprise turns in Soderbergh’s career; since he broke through with 1989’s “Sex, Lies and Videotape,” his eclectic catalog has ranged from the bleak “Contagion” and “Che” to the groovy “Magic Mike” and “Ocean’s Eleven.” His new—and potentially final—release, “Side Effects,” falls in the former camp, and while it is no monumental last hurrah, the film is a riveting mélange of some of the strongest Soderbergh staples: stylish direction, a star-studded, committed cast, and a thought-provoking story with more twists than the director’s own career.
Emily (Rooney Mara) is a young, independent New Yorker whose husband Martin (Channing Tatum) has just finished a prison sentence. It soon becomes clear, though, that their relationship lacks its former spark, and that Emily in particular feels this absence.
Mara drains her eyes of life as she did in “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo;” however, in portraying Emily, Mara has removed Lisbeth’s fiery spunk. Her Emily seems almost dead, yet alive enough to still suffer, and Emily’s melancholia is magnified by the contrast against Tatum’s Martin. Tatum is all swagger here, and the shallowness of his character is intentional; Soderbergh avoids his debonair, heartbreaking smile like the plague. The director casts Martin in shadow and takes every opportunity to zero the camera in on the ghostly, broken Emily.
Enter Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who is as put-together as Emily is in shambles. After surviving a not-so-accidental car crash, Emily begins therapy sessions with Dr. Banks, who, as the modern therapist is wont to do, prescribes her pills, first basic varieties and then, after fervent pleading from Emily, a new, experimental drug called “Ablixa.” For just a second, color returns to Emily’s face; Mara expertly injects bits of warmth into the character as she briefly comes back to the land of the living.
Of course, the titular effects have to kick in sometime, and they do so within the first hour of the film: Emily vomits at work, things become fuzzy, and Martin awakes to a sleepwalking Emily blasting rock music and pouring glasses of milk. Ultimately, tragedy strikes. Banks is forced into the spotlight as his credibility as a psychiatrist is challenged, and he starts to grow paranoid and suspect conspiracy. Law, who for the first third of the movie sticks to his usual British charm, is convincingly shaken as his character’s stressors—and beard—grow and his solid exterior starts to dissolve.
The film could have been a simple—albeit gripping—chart of Emily’s fall and the subsequent descent of Banks. But this is a Soderbergh film, in which things cannot simply be how they appear. Just as Soderbergh peppers the movie with upside-down establishing shots, so does “Side Effects” flip its own established order on its head, partially thanks to the enigmatic Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones, here a dynamo of seductive energy barely contained by thick-rimmed glasses and done-up hair). The final revelation, though completely unexpected, might strike some as cliché or absurd, but it effectively sets up an ending in which not even the most heroic character is left with clean hands.
“Side Effects” constantly engages, even in its long stretches of pure dialogue—Scott Z. Burns’s script moves remarkably fast for its abundant exposition—as well as lengthy periods of silence. The film lightly comments on Americans’ medication dependency; one of the film’s few moments of humor features a patient signing without reading the contract for an experimental treatment, lured by the promise of free pills. A more prominent success, though, is the way it taps into the fear of that dependency, ultimately using this fear to build up audience assumptions before yanking them all away. “Side Effects” may be more about thrill than social critique, but it feels timely and relevant nonetheless.
While the film doesn’t necessarily rise above the rest of his work, Soderbergh is still ending this phase of his career on a high note. Indeed, there wasn’t really a way this film could have felt like an epic finale; it lacks the deep, colorful casts and grandeur of some of his previous work. Soderbergh’s tightly crafted last film, though, still manages to pack his strengths into an effective little thriller, a small creation with powerful effects.

Dunster House Dining Hall
Directed by Katherine Moon '14
Music Directed by George X. Fu '13
Produced by Stephanie A. Havens '14 and Marina P. Chen '15
 
 
 
The Dunster House Opera is notable for being completely run by Harvard undergraduates—this winter, from head to glass slipper. Opening in Dunster Dining Hall on Saturday, this rendition of Jules Massenet’s “Cinderella” (“Cendrillon,” in itsoriginal French) uses an enormous cast, over a dozen named parts, and a shortened script to tell the classic fairy tale.
Director Katherine E. Moon ’14 says the DHO team chose “Cinderella” because it involves as many undergraduate performers as possible: the opera has many main parts and a chorus that is on stage for more than half the production. “We knew the talent that existed on campus, and we wanted to make sure that there were roles to fill and then some,” she says.
The two leads will be played by Adams House roommates Amelia H. Ross ’14 (Cinderella) and Allison A. Ray ’14 (Prince Charming), a casting that is in keeping with Massenet’s double soprano singing parts. 
“[Ray and Ross] have such chemistry together because they’re roommates and best friends. We had to choose them,” co-producer Stephanie A. Havens ’14 says. Because of Ray’s strong vocals and connection with her roommate on stage, Havens decided to maintain the original score’s soprano, and therefore female, Prince Charming.“It was a no brainer,” Havens says.
In addition to including many of Harvard’s talented opera singers, DHO’s “Cinderella” is meant to be an audience-friendly modern adaptation. The script itself is accessible because it both maintains the intended comedy of Massenet’s “Cendrillon” and is comically enhanced by the opera’s sometimes spotty translation, Havens says. “We think the audience would enjoy something more comic,” Havens’s co-producer Marina P. Chen ’15 says. 
Also in an effort to make the opera accessible, Moon and music director George X. Fu ’13 cut DHO’s version of “Cinderella” to a short two hours (including intermission). “If you don’t know anything about opera, this is a great one to come to because we reduced it to make it really digestible and watchable,” Moon says.

February 14-16, 8 p.m.
Written by Mark Ravenhill
Directed by Joshua McTaggart '13
Produced by Simon De Carvalho '14 and David Manella '14
“pool (no water)” is an unconventional drama that is meant to be slightly different each time it is performed. Opening in Adams Pool Theater on Thursday and directed by Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts editor, “pool (no water)” is not told as a linear narrative but through the recollections of the actors as they act out past events.
The story blurs the line between past and present as the actors narrate the breakup of five artists after one actor becomes famous and invites her four colleagues to her enormous home. The climax of the plot centers around an empty swimming pool, which makes the Adams Pool Theatre the perfect venue.
“It’s unlike a lot of scripted shows in that it pushes the actors and the director to make a majority of the decisions,” actor Alistair A. Debling ’16 says. Though there are five characters, there are only four actors in the cast. The fifth character is created through description and referenced by the other actors; the very existence of this fifth person is dependent on the actors themselves. “There aren’t even stage directions—essentially it reads just like a piece of narration of a story,” said Debling.
The play is written as a long piece of text which leaves much of the interpretation to the director and actors; it is at their discretion to divide the block of text into individual lines for each actor. For McTaggart, this play is different from the previous productions he has directed; this show is meant to change with each new cast that performs it. “This piece is written as an ensemble piece…what I’m really trying to encourage and foster in this.... is letting [the actors] play and then I kind of jump in and fix,” said McTaggart.
According to actor John L. Pizzato ’16, “pool (no water)” is not about the story. “What really it’s about is these four artists remembering this information, remembering this story, processing it, and kind of transforming it into an art piece in real time for the audience as they’re performing it.”

Saturday marked the third annual Ivy League Chinese Spring Festival Gala, hosted by the Harvard Chinese Students and Scholars Association to commemorate the traditional Chinese New Year. The event, however, was anything but traditional. Featuring acts ranging from a hip-hop interpretive dance to Chinese folk music to a Hungarian singer’s take of “Toreador Song” from the opera “Carmen,” the Gala didn’t focus, as might be expected, on the Year of the Snake. Instead, says HCSSA President Xu Zhang, a research assistant in SEAS, the Gala was meant as a celebration for a diverse group of students and attendees, many of whom are living far from home. “The main idea is to make [the student performers and spectators] feel at home while studying overseas, to gather together and celebrate with family and friends,” Zhang says.
As audience members poured into Sanders Theatre, the excitement in the air was palpable, as the Gala itself marked the beginning of the holiday festivities. “I think Chinese New Year is like the U.S. Christmas,” says Wen Xie, a student in the School of Public Health and choreographer and dancer for the Student Dance Club at HSPH. “People get together and watch a really huge gala that happens in Beijing every Chinese New Year Eve. I think it’s very hard to recreate this scene in the U.S., since we don’t have any relatives around us, so friends are the ones we want to go to this festival,” Xie said.
The Student Dance Club performed an original dance, “Love in the Source of the Yangtze River.” As the choreographer, Xie’s hope was to convey a universal feeling, love, through a distinctly Chinese narrative. “I’m going to tell a story about a Tibetan lover who falls in love with a boy at the end of the Yangtze River. [They’re] over a thousand miles apart, but it’s the same river they’re looking at every day,” she said. Her dance featured costumes of  her own design, and the twirls of the dancers mimicked both the running river and a Buddhist tower.
Xie, who began dancing at the age of five, says she is eager to share her passion for choreographing and dancing, but the HSPH Dance Club is not limited to experienced dancers or even Chinese students. According to Xie, many of the dancers were first-time performers, and two members of the group are American students. For her, the experience is more about making friends and giving back to the community. “Everybody actually gets a lot of [joy] from the experience during our group dance, and we feel like after the Spring Festival Gala our group is more unified,” she says.
The Gala also reaches beyond the Harvard student body. To create a greater sense of cultural unity among Chinese students studying in the United States, the HCSSA has reached out to its sister organizations at other Ivy League schools. “Harvard hosts the event each year, but the other organizations recommend different programs,” Zhang says. “Everyone is sacrificing time for study to do this entirely for the community,” she adds. “We feel like we have a responsibility to plan to gather together.”
Even for the students who prepared solo performances, the theme of unity and celebrating with family is paramount. “Usually people get together to celebrate this festival, but now I am away from my family, so the Gala is kind of a gathering together of all Chinese students,” says GSAS student Jingyi Yu. Yu presented an original magic show, “A Musical Dream,” featuring a series of CDs that she made disappear to the beat of popular American songs. “This performance doesn’t include much about Chinese culture, but I prepared it specifically for Chinese New Year,” she says.  “Chinese New Year is the most important and most traditional day in my culture, so that’s why I spent a long time preparing this performance.”
The emcees, bedecked in dazzling formal dresses and dapper tuxedos, performed most of their introductions in Chinese. Many of the acts celebrated overcoming the language barrier through an international dedication to the arts. Violinist Julia L. Glenn ’11-’12 showed her knowledge of Chinese as she introduced her violin act. Later, Hungarian opera singer Attila Dobak wowed with his skill in singing French opera, but was met by applause when he sang a humorous Chinese duet concerning traditional wedding vows. Hui Weng needed no language at all to reach the audience with the haunting melodies of her instrument, a stringed zither used in traditional Chinese music.
“I feel it is very important to glorify our Chinese culture in some way, especially in the Chinese community,” says Xie. The Gala not only drew attendees from the Chinese community, but also attracted a diverse audience in an international celebration. Whether understood in Chinese or in English, and whether viewed with friends or with family, the Ivy League Spring Festival Gala marked the beginning of the new year and the strengthening of new bonds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The course enrollment statistics published on Friday show that exciting classes can attract new students and appeal to broad audiences. This semester, 642 students enrolled in Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics.” Sociology 190: “Life and Death in the US: Medicine and Disease in Social Context” grew from 265 students last year to 408 this year. The diversity of popular courses demonstrates that engaging and relevant material, combined with great teaching, can encourage students to investigate new fields that they would not otherwise discover.
Introductory classes are often the gateway to concentrations, and interesting classes have the power to give new life to smaller, less considered fields. Back in 2003, we reported that enrollment in computer science courses had plummeted. Before David J. Malan ’99 took over instruction for Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” the course still enrolled just 132 students. But the pedagogical strength and reputation of CS50 led to its renewal. In fall 2012, CS50 drew 651 students, and the class has inspired students to pursue further studies in the field. Enrollment in Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II” has been rising steadily, with 240 students registered this spring. Without a popular class like CS50, students may never have discovered their interest in computer science. While genuine interest in a subject may survive a boring, dry class, it takes an engaging class to make students aware of interests they never knew they had.
But even when these classes are taken on their own merit and not as part of a path to a potential concentration, they are a powerful part of the educational experience. Of the hundreds of students per class who take Stat 104, only a small handful will pursue a degree in statistics. Similarly, only a fraction of CS50 students will graduate from Harvard with a computer science degree. But in a world where problems cut across disciplines, the high course enrollments in courses that teach the essential tools of a field are encouraging. Harvard provides the opportunity for students in the social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences to apply tools from other fields to their own areas of interest. The enrollment numbers show that students are taking advantage of that opportunity.
The key to these courses is often good teaching. While courses like Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” regularly report huge enrollments because of already-prevalent student interest in economics, courses that seek to attract students to new fields need good teaching. CS50 has gained a huge following among undergrads in part because of the course’s commitment to innovative teaching. Any concentration that hopes to attract new students by offering an accessible introductory course needs to think seriously about pedagogy, and the result is courses that raise the bar for teaching at Harvard.
Exposing students to new fields and varied modes of thought should be an objective of the Harvard experience. This is especially crucial for fields like computer science, where it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of innovation in both technical and humanistic spheres lies. This spring’s most popular courses indicate that students are pursuing fields that will allow them to explore and enrich themselves.

Remember when you still thought you’d be president someday? I sure do. Perhaps the single greatest privilege slipped in the envelope with each Harvard acceptance letter is the right to keep dreaming of being special for a few more years than most before succumbing to the pressure to settle for normality.
I’ll restrict myself to telling the evolution of one particular species of Harvard freshman, the politico, since that is what I know best from personal experience.
You arrive as a wide-eyed freshman, thinking there’s nothing you’d rather do with your life than politics. Your acceptance has confirmed to you that you were endowed at birth with intelligence of world-historical consequence. “Remember me when you run the country,” your friends and family tell you before you leave home. Almost all the Harvard grads you’ve heard of (if you had a normal adolescence and had the good fortune not to go to an elite Northeastern boarding school where everyone goes to the Ivy League) went on to be powerful and famous, so there’s no doubt that you will as well. You have yet to grasp the startling fact that there are tens of thousands of no-name Harvard grads out there somewhere, quietly plugging away in careers that will never be newsworthy. Political paralysis is nothing; Washington will regain animation based on the sheer force of your arguments. Senator [insert last name here] sure sounds nice, doesn’t it?
The first few months on campus put some major dents in your ego. It’s likely your first time meeting people your own age as smart as or (gasp) smarter than yourself. It stings a little. Those dreams of future importance begin to deflate. You can’t all be president.
A year or two later, the sirens of the exclusive and lucrative banking and consulting worlds begin to call. Everyone who showed up freshman year wanting to change the world is now chasing money, your classmates complain. But money is power in the real world, and going into politics or “public service” immediately after college with no real skills is a waste of time, others respond. As a recruiter from a major consulting firm put it last fall, “If you want to save the world, don’t go file papers for some non-profit. Learn how to do things.” But you also wonder if anyone persuaded by these arguments actually remembers to try to change the world later in life.
Jadedness sets in. Politics now seems so hard, and for what? Harvard students are risk-averse and idealistic above almost all else, and politics is nothing if not risky and cynical. Oil and water. Your continued employment is based on the whims of a fickle and distracted electorate and on your fealty to the party and donors who fund your campaigns. If you’re in national office, your hopes of making real change are endlessly thwarted by gridlock and polarization. Who wants to make the sacrifice to become a politician only to resign in exasperation over Washington’s dysfunction?
David Brooks used the movie “Lincoln” as a springboard to argue that despite all its warts, politics is still the best game in town for those who want to change the world for the better.
But the Washington defined by the “marriage of high vision and low cunning” that Brooks lauds doesn’t exist anymore. Today’s 24/7 news cycle would instantly sniff out the dubious tactics used by Abe Lincoln to wrangle together support for the 13th Amendment. The alternative to political shenanigans is (God forbid) public support for smart policies, but that’s a nonstarter for now.
Brooks calls politics noble, but the only memorable instance of nobility in American politics in the last decade was the volley of courageous votes for Obamacare cast by politicians (like my own Senator Ben Nelson, who was heckled out of an Omaha restaurant when dining with his wife following his vote) who knew a yes vote would likely mean the end of their political careers but were willing to sacrifice themselves for a cause—expanded access to health care—that they believed to be larger than themselves.
After this long evolution to disenchantment, only about one percent of Harvard students end up going into politics after graduation. They are one of the great enigmas of this college. I can’t tell whether they are drawn by blind hope, selfish ambition, a sense of purpose, or something else entirely. Whatever it is, they are some of the rare few here who defy the seemingly inexorable pull towards the stable, well-trodden path.
But maybe Brooks is right. Maybe the Lincolns of history and Harvard are those who, despite all of these well-founded concerns, stubbornly plunge headlong into the jungle of politics out of a desire to make a real difference in the world. At this moment and in this country, that idea seems sadly naïve. But at least they get to keep dreaming.

Ninety-four years after women won the right to vote, 64 years after being formally allowed in the armed forces, and 16 years after the release of GI Jane, women can finally fight on the front line of battle. It is a truly historic occasion.
The announcement came at a press conference on Thursday, January 24. Pentagon Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin E. Dempsey formally rescinded the 1994 ban on women serving in combat roles in the military.
As far as contemporary civil liberties go, it is one thing to fight for free birth control, unisex bathrooms, or genderless pronouns. However, it’s an entirely different ballgame to fight for the right to live in a muddy hole while being shot at. There is no ulterior motive to be employed in the world’s most dangerous profession. The right to fight on the front line is a right won completely without pretense; it is a right to protect America and the freedom it represents.
It is important to note those who opposed the inclusion of women on the front line are not all curmudgeonly Archie Bunkers in uniform. These are people genuinely concerned with the safety of the troops.  Sure, their reasons can be occasionally misguided and even misogynistic (re: all that drivel about menstruation and bears). Some are concerned about romantic relationships and the heightened risks of rape. However, both risks must be viewed in perspective. It takes a somewhat dubious stretch of the imagination to imagine seriously disruptive trench gossip about who likes whom when people's lives are at stake. Moreover, women who enter the military at all know there is a higher risk of rape just as they know there is a higher risk of combat-related death by being in a combat zone. There is also a higher chance of harassment, but women should not be punished for it.
Yet most arguments about why women should not be on the front line were ruled out 64 years ago when women were allowed in the armed forces at all. All arguments made about the physical capabilities of women are irrelevant because women will still have to pass the same physical standards. The front line is the most dangerous position one can take. The inclusion of women does not come as a courtesy. There is no mulligan in the military. There are no handicaps or chivalry when the stakes are life and death.
However, it is important to note, the admission of women to the front line comes a little late. The term “front line” is somewhat past its prime, and women have already been fighting on it for many years. In modern warfare, threats are ubiquitous. The use of biological and cyber terrorism facilitates remote attacks. The “front line” is not necessarily in “front,” nor a “line,” nor “ontli,” for that matter. Though I suppose, “combat orbs” probably didn’t get far in Defense Department meetings.
Subsequently, women have been fighting on the front line for years. John McCain, who publicly acknowledged his support of Panetta’s decision, noted, “The fact is that American women are already serving in harm's way today all over the world and in every branch of our armed forces… Many have made the ultimate sacrifice, and our nation owes them a deep debt of gratitude.”
As far as we’ve come, there are still many places to go. Secretary Panetta, in addition to repealing the ban on combat, stated, “we are moving forward with a plan to eliminate all unnecessary gender-based barriers to service.” Women are still barred from elite Special Operations, including the Navy SEALS, Army Rangers, Delta Force, and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment.
Moreover, 80 percent of generals have served in front-line combat. Clearly, experience on the front line is important for leadership. It is harder to follow orders when there is doubt that the person giving them has not experienced firsthand what those orders might entail. Opening up the front line can move women up the chain of command.
Women make up only 14 percent of the 1.4 million American military personnel. However, it is not the percent but the principle that counts. Each and every woman has the right to work, though many choose to stay home.
As a woman who plans to join the Navy after graduation, I am proud of the Secretary’s decision. It’s a milestone for the extension of civil liberties. In the words of the president, “valor knows no gender.”

This is the second instalment in a series of online-only Roundtables. Roundtables aim to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinion on thought-provoking issues.
If you would like to submit an opinion for this week's Roundtable topic, "Drones have played a vital and necessary role in the war on terror. How far do you agree with this statement?" please e-mail your 200-300 word opinion to hpickerell@college.harvard.edu before Wednesday, February 13 at 6 p.m.
 
 
Diversification Is Not Always a Sign of Progress
To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army.
However, I still find myself uncomfortable with the prospect of actively supporting this decision for a few reasons. First, it does not address some of the fundamental, underlying issues that make equality within the military impossible. For instance, sexual assault happens in the U.S. military at overwhelming rates, and effective measures are not being taken to address this situation. Gender equality is entirely impossible if members of certain genders are living in fear of violence from members of other genders.
Secondly, no one should be fighting on the front lines. Let me be clear: I am not faulting soldiers for choosing to be soldiers. Many factors go into making such a decision, and joining the army is essentially the only option for some. I am instead faulting the U.S. military itself for existing, or at least existing in a capacity that involves sending people into combat.
The U.S. military is an inherently imperialistic entity. It does not exist, and has long not existed, for defense. The last war fought on U.S. soil against an invading army took place in 1812, and since then the U.S. has been dispatching its troops to every corner of the globe, fighting wars for selfish reasons that usually boil down to a hatred of communism or a desire for oil. Does a fight for equality within such an institution really have meaning?
Essentially, as long as we maintain a definition of progress that limits itself to diversification—which often consists of the diversification of oppressive institutions—we lose sight of the real benchmark of progress: the elimination of the institutions that cause oppression in the first place.

Prejudice in Disguise
 
Growing up in Singapore, I came to internalize the idea that it is men’s responsibility to protect the women in their lives. The thought of a woman putting herself in harm’s way to protect me makes me cringe.
But I have also served alongside many women in my nation’s armed forces. Many of them are now serving in combat command roles, and when I complete my term of service after college, one of them may be my commander in the field. It is no coincidence that so many of them made it to command school, for the few women who are prepared to ignore centuries of social expectation and enlist in a traditionally male-dominated organization tend to be more motivated and resilient than the average recruit.
They were tougher soldiers, better fighters, and more capable leaders than most of the men in their cohort. My country is, objectively speaking, a safer place because I am now studying at Harvard and they are in my place on our front lines.
I am uncomfortable with the idea of women serving in combat, and due to my upbringing I probably always will be. But being uncomfortable with something is not a rational argument for prohibiting it. The arguments against women serving in combat positions—the threat of rape, undermining unit cohesion, physical ability—are merely attempts at rationalizing an innate prejudice built on patriarchal notions of gender. In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty.
If female soldiers are qualified, motivated, and competent, which they are, their governments should let them serve just like everyone else.

 Technology Enables Women to Participate in Combat
In the often politically fraught debate on women’s participation in armed combat in the United States, two positions often clash—women’s rights to equal opportunity in a free society and their effectiveness in combat. To take some of the heat out of this debate, it may be useful to consider a broader historical perspective.
Only until the latter part of the nineteenth century did advancements in weapons technology free women from some of the earlier, physical obstacles of participating in military campaigns. In prior history, close quarter combat had favoured the exclusion of women on grounds of physical disparity with men. Yet during the American Civil War, the Union Army, recruiting from an informed, free citizenry, included a few intrepid woman soldiers. To participate they had to be disguised as men. Equipped with not-too-heavy muskets and armed with Minié balls, these combat pioneers were able to kill at a distance of 400 yards.
Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat.
Today, all but few casualties of war are caused by distantly operating weapons systems. Radar-directed artillery, fighter and bomber jets, as well as drones can all be flown and commanded by women. Advancing technology will continue to pave the way for women’s participation in all forms of combat, with or without political advocacy.

A Fight for Fairness
The U.S. military has a lot to gain from allowing women to serve in combat roles. First, there is the simple truth that there are many American women who possess the strength and skills to perform at or above the level of many male soldiers. The current rules barring them on the basis of their sex alone send the message that women are inherently physically inferior to men regardless of their personal qualifications. Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country.
Second, the more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed.
This argument for the inclusion of women comes with one caveat. Women should be held to the same training standards as men. Instituting consistent rules will help male troops to trust their female comrades as equals and will ensure that the strength of the fighting force is not compromised. It is also the fairest way for the government to respect the potential of women to be just as strong as men.

Not Such a Sweet Girl
Manpower demands have largely justified women’s right of entry into military forces of sovereign states. All across the world, countries that currently recruit women for combat roles were prompted by a need to boost the number of boots on the ground. But it should not just be numerical necessity that drives us as thinking citizens to advocate for combat roles to be open to women. Rather, our collective concern about the insidious social messages we propagate by passively accepting the exclusion of women should also push us to change the status quo.
Aren’t we all tired of sexist messages in our world? Yes, we can now laugh at our parents’ childhood anecdotes: young, sweet girls played with tea sets, while boys were allowed, and in fact encouraged, to be physical with each other. But we still hear phrases like “girls shouldn’t be so aggressive” or “a good girl would never that.” Just over winter break, I told a friend that I was considering the military as a post-graduation option, and he said: “See? That’s your problem—you’re not a good girl. That’s why I like Sherry. She’s sweet.”
What messages reverberate throughout our society when we deny women combat roles in the military? The tyranny of “good girls are sweet and kind” continues to spread socio-cultural messages about what sort of occupations women should have as well as the sort of occupations men should not have.
When we go to war, we fight for principled values that we deem worth protecting, and the socially-endorsed system of military roles for men and women should be aligned with those values.

The Military In An Age Of Equality
It seems that the objections to women serving in combat roles can be summarized into three basic arguments. First, it is a much beloved statement of those opposing an inclusive policy for combat positions that women are “biologically” less capable of aerobic endurance or muscular strength than men, a difficult fact to deny on average. However, we are not attempting to compare men’s and women’s capacities for strength and endurance. Instead, the question is whether a woman would be able to complete the physical requirements needed for a combat position, which should be set by necessity, not by a discriminatory stipulation of gender. While fewer women might achieve such levels, as Jon Soltz, notes: “There are women who can meet these standards, and they have a right to compete."
A second, more quaint, protectionist argument is that women would be incapable of matching men in managing the realities of being in a combat zone for an extended period of time, including handling “lack of hygiene” or the risk of gender-specific mistreatment if captured. This argument forgets that the women who are vying for these combat roles often have experience with this in their current roles and understand that the miserable conditions they will be exposed to will be no more difficult than that of their male colleagues. They accept the danger that, if captured, they will be subjected to tortures that specifically target females and yet are willing to face them in service of their country. I certainly would not be the one to deny such a sense of duty.
Third, there are concerns that the effectiveness of a combat unit would be psychologically impaired by the presence of a woman, either in the form of sexual relationships or an altered team dynamic. Although it is difficult to deny that men and women interact differently while on a team together, that is not to say that such a team would be the worse for it. Bringing women into combat roles would be a revolution to the military’s mode of operations. Currently, women are mere footnotes in an otherwise male-dominated community. They already occupy combat roles in all but name, but they are kept back by their lack of equal consideration. Granting women equal status would require completely integrated training, which would create the close but professional relationships that define a team. That training will break down the psychological impact of having a woman present, an oft cited in the debate today.
As far as sex is concerned—it happens. You could draw a similarity to women in any other profession, where the ability to have sex is not considered a disqualifier. The only difference in this case is the close proximity associated with a combat team. What is needed is the ability of all members of that team to act professionally, as already required by all those in any military positions. Pregnancy would be undoubtedly undesirable while in a combat role, but it is also highly preventable. Working women who do not want to become pregnant are able to prevent it. Why, then, should it be any different for women wishing for a career in combat?
It seems to me that every one of these arguments is riddled with a view of women that is becoming increasingly out of date every day. It has happened quickly, yes, but there is no reason that the military should be exempt from changing with the times.

Watching too much television can lower a man’s sperm count by up to 44 percent, according to a recent study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health.
Published Monday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, the study also found that otherwise healthy young men who do not exercise have significantly lower sperm counts than men who do exercise.
Researchers at HSPH analyzed the semen quality of 189 college-aged men and recorded data about their average physical activity and TV viewing patterns.
“When we analyzed the data, we found that men who watched more than 20 hours per week had 44 percent lower sperm counts than those who watched almost no TV,” said Audrey J. Gaskins, lead author of the study and a doctoral student at HSPH. “Conversely, those who exercised the most at a moderate to vigorous rate had 73 percent higher sperm count than those who exercised less than five hours per week.”
Previous studies have found that male sperm counts have declined in western countries over the last 60 years, but none have yet identified such a direct link between sperm count and physical habits.
“So much of the research that has been done in this area has been related to environmental chemicals. What chemicals have been introduced into the environment in the last 60-year period that may be the reason behind the decreasing sperm counts?” said Jorge E. Chavarro, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of nutrition and epidemiology at HSPH.  “But something that has not received as much attention is whether lifestyle factors such as diet, where people live, [and] how people move around might have also influenced these declines in sperm counts.”
Gaskins added that previous investigations did not target the average population.
“The majority of them have focused on professional athletes like marathon runners and elite cyclists. They generally reach activity levels that most people in the world can’t match,” she said. “So we set out to look at this question in a population of men that is somewhat more relevant to the population.”
The mechanism by which a more sedentary lifestyle diminishes sperm is not yet fully understood, researchers said. But Gaskins offered some potential explanations.
“Sedentary behavior has been linked to increased levels of oxidative stress, and oxidative stress can damage male germ cells...responsible for producing sperm,” she said. “There’s also the rationale that sedentary conditions have been linked to increased sperm temperature, and spermatogenesis is a temperature-dependent process.”

Kaia Stern, a lecturer at Harvard Divinity School, called the Harvard Interfaith Prison Education program an invaluable step towards fixing a prison system in “crisis” at the program’s official kick-off event Thursday evening.
HIPE, which was founded in November through a partnership between the Harvard Episcopalians and Harvard Hillel, pairs mentors with incarcerated individuals working towards their Bachelor’s Degrees at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Norfolk.
Stern, co-founder and director of the Prison Studies Project, first began  interest in America’s penal system began in college, and she has been involved in educating inmates ever since. Speaking to HIPE’s volunteers at Hillel on Thursday, Stern, who is also an ordained interfaith minister, shared her personal experiences witnessing the many opportunities and challenges faced by prisoners.
Stern spoke about mass overcrowding and longer imprisonment sentences due to increased commercialization and profit-seeking within the prison system. The issues she touched on, said Harvard’s Episcopal Chaplain Reverend Luther Zeigler, will help HIPE become “sensitive to the overall context” within which it will work.
“While a huge part of this project is building relationships with incarcerated individuals and mentoring them as they pursue their bachelor’s degree, you can add different components such as educating people outside of the program [and] educating ourselves about the prison system in America,” said HIPE co-founder and Divinity School graduate Hilly Haber.
HIPE’s 21 members come from across the University, including the College, the Graduate School of Education, Hillel, the Episcopal Chaplaincy, the Divinity School, the School of Public Health, and the Law School. And unlike other education programs, HIPE emphasizes its interfaith platform.
“There is a theological dimension to what we are doing,” said Zeigler. “We are not only trying to be mentors and friends to these prisoners, but to understand that relationship in the context of our own religious traditions.”

A new installation at the Lamont Woodberry Poetry Room commemorates a time in Cambridge history when one could dial ‘617-492-1144’ and hear anyone from Allen Ginsberg to the Pope read a poem out loud.
A gathering on Thursday kicked off the spring 2013 season at the Woodberry Poetry Room, whose new gallery features archived recordings and other paraphernalia from the “Phone-A-Poem” service that operated out of Cambridge for 25 years from 1976 to 2001. Visitors can sit down and hear, in addition to the beats and the beatified, Donald Hall ’51, Jane Kenyon, Ifeanyi Menkiti, James Tate, and others. The “Phone-A-Poem” exhibit will be on display until May.
“The idea was to liberate poems, take them out of books and libraries,” said Peter Payack, the Cambridge-based poet and writer who first conceived of the project in 1976. “I think some people would be intimidated to go to a poetry reading—I know I used to be. This way, it was like a conversation, and if you didn’t like the poem you could hang up.”
The exhibit attests to the relative fame the project achieved. At one point, the project’s coordinators reached an agreement with Out of Town News to have poetry readings and bands perform on the roof, and a scrolling sign that wrapped around the stand displayed poems by local schoolchildren. One week, the service featured a recording from the Pope and received over 25,000 calls.
“It seems hard to believe, but at the time all of this technology was completely novel,” said Christina Davis, the curator of the Poetry Room.
Payack and Roland F. Pease, a publisher who became involved in the project, sent out postcards to poets they liked. Each card contained just two checkboxes to indicate whether the poet wanted to be involved in the project or not.
“If they said yes, I sent a cassette,” said Pease. “Almost everyone agreed.”
GSAS art history student Camran J. Mani came across the poster for the event and attended on a whim. “I liked it,” said Mani. “It feels very intimate to hear [a poem] on the phone.”
“Phone-A-Poem” eventually stopped in 2001, when it gradually became redundant because advent of the internet. The resources it had accumulated went to Emerson College, where it soon died out after a few years.
“I wanted to put poetry out there for everyone to experience,” said Payack. “Now [the project] is here and I’m thrilled.”

The week after Harvard made an announcement intended to put to rest its largest cheating investigation in recent memory, faculty members said they need to do a better job communicating course expectations to students and laying down the groundwork for academic honesty at a time when technology is blurring the lines of right and wrong.
Citing a lack of information from the University, faculty members interviewed for this article were hesitant to remark on the administration’s handling of the Government 1310 case, in which about 125 students were investigated for inappropriately collaborating on a take-home final in assistant government professor Matthew B. Platt’s “Introduction to Congress” course last spring. Instead, in private conversations and departmental meetings, professors said they have begun to examine the source of the problem and the role that they might play in combatting it.
History professor Andrew D. Gordon, who teaches a General Education course on Japanese history, said that based on the limited information faculty members have received, he thinks that the professor and students are jointly culpable in the Government 1310 case.
Drawing an analogy, he explained that the situation is comparable to the professor who leaves the house each morning without locking the door.
“You can say that the professor should have known better than to not lock his door because there are people who do dishonest things,” Gordon said, “but it still doesn’t mean it’s right to go in to steal stuff.”
Gordon added that faculty members need to do a better job accounting for and incorporating the technology that makes widespread information sharing possible. For a course he taught last fall, Gordon said that, with the help of a teaching fellow, he encouraged students to start a group Google document to share definitions and pose questions.
“I thought that was a fabulous type of group work. It should be encouraged,” Gordon said. But, he added, “we’ve got to be attentive to how we design courses and how we deal with an evolving landscape of information.”
Systematic biology professor Donald H. Pfister said that professors have become particularly mindful of collaboration policies in their own courses in the wake of the scandal.
“I think everybody that I know is trying to be as explicit as they can be about expectations about how [students] work with other students,” said Pfister, the one-time chair of the Committee to Review the Administrative Board, which convened from 2007 to 2009.
“I think it’s the faculty’s role to set out expectations, and that includes how students anticipate being in a course,” said Pfister, who is teaching a Science of Living Systems Gen Ed course this spring. “Good syllabi, good outlines—that’s all part of the job of teaching.”
Government and sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol said she assigns a take-home exam in her own United States and the World Gen Ed course, but has never had a problem with widespread cheating. She said she worries that the University’s handling of the case will cause faculty to lose sight of the value of collaboration as they tighten restrictions on group work.
“We cannot discourage people from talking, no matter what we do,” Skocpol said. “Teamwork is often a good thing in learning, and I just feel like a vague thing launched out there was causing people to forget about the basics.”
Rather, Skocpol said, faculty should redirect their attention to those basics—clear communication among students, teaching fellows, and faculty about course expectations and policies.
“Vague statements that there is a general crisis are not effective in encouraging people in learn to be better,” she said.
PRESSING RESET
The Committee on Academic Integrity, first convened in fall 2010 to investigate the climate of academic honesty at Harvard, presented a host of preliminary proposals to rework the University’s approach to academic integrity at the monthly faculty meeting Tuesday.
Chief among those early recommendations is an honor code, which Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said he hopes would present clearer expectations about academic honesty to students and deter inappropriate collaboration and outright cases of cheating within the College.
“We are looking in some sense to reset our relationship with our students,” Harris said. How an honor code might be best implemented is not yet clear, he added, citing a wide range of approaches taken by other schools with similar policies.
“[We recognize that] academic integrity is not magically transformed by an honor code,” Harris said. “We are mindful of the fact that often many of us take for granted that students know everything that they need to know about the expectations in each of our individual disciplines.”
Harris offered a range of other possible suggestions, ranging from increased College programming on academic ethics to exam-making and grading rubrics for faculty. Harris said recommendations will be made final at next month’s faculty meeting and should be ready for implementation later in the spring.

If meteorologists are correct, this weekend’s forecasted superstorm could potentially blanket Harvard Yard with more than two feet of snow, and in one blustery white swoop, Cambridge would receive roughly half of its average annual snowfall.
The likelihood of such heavy snow, along with projections of strong winds and low visibility, have prompted the University to cancel all classes beginning at or after 12 p.m. Friday.
All non-residential University facilities, including libraries, will also close at noon in deference to what the National Weather Service called a “potential historic winter storm” in a blizzard warning it issued.
“This is not an everyday occurrence by any stretch of the imagination,” said Alan E. Dunham, a meteorologist with the Weather Service’s Taunton, Mass., office. “I can’t rememeber seeing us issue a snowfall forecast for this much accumulation for so much of the state.”
Dunham said the Weather Service anticipates that light snow will begin falling Friday morning and intensify in the afternoon and then evening hours, before blizzard and whiteout conditions prevail overnight.
By Saturday evening, he said, widespread totals could reach more than two feet—and as high as 30 inches in some places.
Dunham said that with high winds and costal flooding also expected, he would not be surprised by widespread power outages across the region.
Overnight temperatures could dip as low as seven degrees Fahrenheit on Saturday night.
Harvard Campus Services, which is responsible for facilities upkeep and snow removal, spent Thursday prepping equipment and buildings for the storm, according to Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin.
He wrote in an email that snow-response teams will be “fully-staffed and on-campus for the duration of the storm.”
The storm has already led to a host of cancellations on- and off-campus, with area universities and Harvard organizations readjusting their weekend schedules.
The City of Cambridge will close Friday at 11 a.m. and Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 has ordered the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to suspend T service by 3 p.m.
Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which usually closes each day between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m., will keep its doors open all day Friday and Saturday, according the shelter’s administrative director Charles A. Hobbs IV ’13.
Many varsity sports competitions scheduled for this weekend have been either cancelled or postponed.
In addition, the first-year social committee announced Wednesday that it would postpone the annual freshman formal, which was previously scheduled for Friday night.
The storm is already drawing comparisons to the blizzard of February 1978, the last time Harvard cancelled a full day of classes due to snow.
That storm dropped 27.1 inches of snow, trailing only a 27.6-inch snowfall in 2003, the Boston record for a single storm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Historical Commission has ruled that a Harvard fence is too great a work of art to be adorned with more art.
The Commission voted Thursday night to strike down a University proposal that would have affixed decorative panels to sections of the fence guarding entry to Harvard Yard in the Science Center Plaza.
The roughly 15 Cambridge residents in attendence for the Commission’s vote voiced sharp opposition to Harvard’s plan, which Cantabridgian Francis E. Donovan ’59 called a “gross misuse of these sacred wrought-iron fences.”
Officials in the Harvard University Planning Office had hoped to showcase colorful student artwork on the panels in an effort to foster a vibrant community atmosphere in the Science Center Plaza, which is currently being renovated as part of Harvard’s Common Spaces initiative.
But the Commission members who voted down Harvard’s proposal at Thursday’s public hearing said that the plan violated the historical and artistic integrity of Harvard’s wrought-iron fences.
“The fence itself is a work of art that needs to be treated with as much respect as a building,” commission member Chandra Harrington said at the hearing.
Cambridge residents in attendance echoed Harrington’s sentiment.
“Nothing could be more incongruous than posting signboards on that fence,” Donovan said.
Another Cambridge resident who spoke at the meeting, Marilee Myers, was more blunt. “You might as well hang a billboard around John Harvard’s neck,” she said.
Harvard oficials had planned to display the four-by-five foot panels on the sections of the fence that run between Meyer and Holworthy Gates during the fall and spring semesters. They had intended to establish a committee, likely comprised of Harvard students and faculty, that would select the art to be displayed.
The University was required to seek the approval of the Commission because the Harvard Yard Fence, like the Yard itself, is part of the Old Cambridge Historic District.
The Commission’s final vote to table Harvard’s plan, 6-2-1, reflected the abstention of Jo M. Solet, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School.
The vote did not close the door on an alternative University plan—which would fall outside of the Commission’s jurisdiction—to set up an exhibition of movable panels that would not directly touch the fence.
Cantabridgian James Williamson, who was present at the meeting, criticized what he called insufficient community outreach conducted by the University Planning Office in regard to the plan.
“Harvard missed an opportunity in not engaging its students and neighboring communities in the making of this project,” he said. “Hopefully the administration will learn for the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As its fifth and final application deadline nears, Teach for America is pushing for applicants from the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields—a group of disciplines known collectively as STEM.
On Thursday night, a little more than a week before its Feb. 15 deadline, Teach for America executives assembled a group of STEM undergraduates from Harvard and other colleges in the Northeast and spoke to them about the current “crisis” in the American education system—namely, the poor quality of math and science education.
“If we don’t have a workforce skilled in math and science, the country and the economy will be in trouble,” Executive Director of TFA in Massachusetts Josh Biber told the crowd.
According to a projection from a recent Georgetown study, the number of STEM jobs in the U.S. will grow to eight million by 2018.
But, as Biber was quick to point out, the American education system may be failing to meet the demand for skilled workers.
Biber discussed his experience teaching in Phoenix and his shock at discovering that his 10-year-old students had never taken a science class. He said that he took it upon himself to introduce his students to science.
“Despite myself and my perceived disinterest in all things science, I said, ‘Someone has to teach them science,’” Biber said.
Cambridge Mayor Henrietta Davis also spoke at the event, stressing that improving math and science education was a priority in Cambridge as well as the rest of the nation.
“We’re not that different from any place else in the country,” Davis said. “We have the most privileged children—children of Nobel Prize winners—but we also have the poorest children—children of immigrants.”
According to Melissa Moritz, an MIT graduate and the Head of TFA’s STEM Initiative, school districts continue to ask for more STEM teachers. But despite the high demand, teachers from the quantitative fields are in particularly low supply.
“STEM teachers are the hardest to recruit because they have so many options right after graduation,” Moritz said.
Of Teach for America’s 10,000 corps members, one-third teach math and science at the secondary level. Another third teach math and science at the elementary level.
The bio-tech firm Amgen hosted the event at its research and development site in Kendall Square. Every year since 2006, Amgen has funded 100 fellowships to TFA STEM teachers, who receive signing bonuses as well as funds to buy classroom supplies.
Davis urged the undergraduates present to pursue teaching careers in STEM fields, adding that Cambridge and the rest of country had much work to do in improving STEM education.
“You’re the answer to the dreams of no less than the White House,” Davis said to the audience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Somehow, someway, the Harvard men’s basketball team has made it through the first four games of its conference season unscathed.
Despite facing late deficits in its first two contests against Dartmouth and nearly blowing large second-half leads in its subsequent games against Brown and Yale, the Crimson sits atop the league as it heads into its first conference road trip of the season this weekend.
“The victories have been very encouraging and inspiring in a lot of ways,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It’s given us a lot of life, a lot of spirit to [be] in first place.... But we also have to remember the journey and the process that’s taken place thus far to be there and some of that has been very good and some things have been disappointing.”
This weekend, no longer will the Crimson (12-6, 4-0 Ivy) be fortunate enough to face the Big Green, the league’s consistent bottom-dweller, nor will it be playing in the comforts of Lavietes Pavilion, where it has won 37 of its past 39 games.
Instead, Harvard travels to New York to play talented yet inconsistent rivals Cornell (10-11, 2-2) and Columbia (9-9, 1-3).
“There’s no question that both teams are good and they’ve always played us very tough,” Amaker said.
The trip will bring back positive memories for the Crimson’s upperclassmen, who clinched the program’s second Ivy title by sweeping those two teams in the season’s final weekend 11 months ago.
But the Big Red’s Newman Arena and the Lions’ Levien Gymnasium both proved to be extremely challenging environments for a veteran team that went 26-4 during the regular season.
Last year, Harvard squeaked out an overtime win over Columbia before edging the Big Red by four. Now, a far less experienced squad that has already lost more games than its predecessor is tasked with achieving the same result.
“You’re never comfortable on the road [with a] hostile environment, the crowd going against you,” freshman point guard Siyani Chambers said. “The first time that you’re doing this, you’re really nervous, but you’re also really excited.”
The Big Red will come first, highlighted by its long, athletic forwards, Errick Peck and 2011-2012 Ivy Rookie of the Year Shonn Miller.
Peck missed all of last season due to injury but has slowly re-found the form that made him a breakout player as a sophomore. The forward had his best game of the year in Cornell’s most recent contest, scoring 20 points on eight-of-eight shooting from the field in a 71-69 road win over Penn.
Miller leads the squad in scoring with 10.1 points per game, is third in the conference in rebounding (7.0 per game), and is second in blocks (1.6 per contest). Senior guard Johnathan Gray provides leadership in the backcourt as well as 9.3 points.
“We have to make sure we get back in transition with all their guys because I think they’re pretty athletic on the perimeter as well,” Amaker said. “We have to see if we can keep them off the backboard...and [we need to] make them work on the defensive end. We’re hopeful that we can get them to expend some energy there.”
On Saturday, the Crimson faces the Lions, who along with Harvard and Princeton were expected to compete for their first league title in 45 years. But Columbia has struggled in league play thus far and has been upset by the Big Red at home and the Quakers on the road.
The Lions are led by point guard Brian Barbour, a 2011-2012 first-team All-Ivy recipient who is sixth in the conference in scoring (13.6 points per game) while pacing the league in assist-to-turnover ratio.
The senior scored 23 points in the teams’ last meeting, and Amaker said that given Barbour’s quickness, sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, rather than Chambers, could be given the task of defending the point guard.
“Wesley is our best perimeter defender,” Amaker said. “We need him to be able to guard multiple positions.”
6’9” center Mark Cisco (9.8 PPG, 5.7 RPG) could also pose trouble inside for the undersized Crimson, which starts the 6’6” Jonah Travis at center.
“What we may lack in height and size, we’re hopeful that they’re sitting over there thinking, ‘Well how are we going to guard Jonah because he’s so quick?,’” Amaker said.
The stakes are similar for both opponents. Sitting in the middle of the standings with multiple conference losses on their resumes, both Cornell and Columbia know that one more defeat would all but doom their chances at a league title.
“We do feel like this is a chance, this weekend, for things in a lot of ways to start taking shape in our league,” Amaker said. “If we can somehow survive this weekend [with two wins]...it would be an amazing feat for us at this stage in the conference race.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team (5-15-1, 3-12-0 ECAC) will look to break an eight-game losing streak on national television against No. 17 Dartmouth on Saturday night at the Bright Hockey Center, which is still on schedule despite the incoming snow storm.
The Crimson’s last victory came in early January against Boston University, whom Harvard will play in the upcoming consolation game of the Beanpot tournament on Monday evening.
Coming off a 4-1 loss at the hands of No. 5 Boston College in the opening round of the Beanpot, Harvard will briefly resume league play against the Big Green (11-8-3, 7-6-2 ECAC), which started Harvard’s lengthy losing streak with a 3-2 defeat of the Crimson at the Thompson Arena in Hanover, N.H several weeks ago.
"I think we're at a spot with the group that we want to get rewarded with some victories,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It's been a tough stretch, but the attitude of the group has been positive. The work ethic is good. We are making some improvements, [and] there are certainly some things we can do better. We're working on those.”
Dartmouth’s strong season so far has come as bit of a surprise, with the Big Green slotted at seventh and tenth in the pre-season ECAC Coaches’ and Media poll, respectively. With wins over Yale, Union, Vermont, and New Hampshire, Dartmouth reached the top ten in national rankings earlier this year.
Led by sophomore Tyler Sikura and junior Matt Linblad, who lead the team with 26 and 23 points respectively, the Big Green will look to sweep the season series and move up in the ECAC standings, where it currently sits in third place ahead of the last-place Crimson.
Harvard has not finished in last place in recent memory, and at least up through the last 50 years of its league play.
"It's definitely been difficult, we've faced a lot of adversity,” captain Danny Biega said. “It takes its toll as losses add up. We're all sticking with it and showing up to the rink with a good attitude. No one is feeling bad for us, we just got to dig ourselves out of this hole we're in right now. I really think we're making good steps and strides towards doing that."
Leading the Crimson as it counters Dartmouth, which has only one road win on the season, will be freshman Jimmy Vesey. The Harvard forward is first on the team with 10 goals and 14 assists, was recently named the ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Week for the third time, and is second in the nation among first-years with a 0.56 goals-per-game average.
The freshman was also recently selected as a semifinalist for the Walter Brown award. The oldest nationally recognized college hockey honor, this award is presented to the best American-born college hockey player in New England.
Despite the difficulties the Crimson has faced so far this season, junior goalie Raphael Girard has been able to rack up saves and is now just six shy of 600. He had a 42-save performance against the Eagles last Monday, two shy of his season high.
In the last couple of years, the Beanpot has been somewhat of a jumping off point for Harvard into the final stretch of the regular season and playoffs. The team will look to replicate this trend this season as well.
In the 2010-2011 campaign, the Crimson, after a poor start to the season, scored two late goals to overcome the then-No. 15 Terriers. Harvard went on to win seven of its next eight games before falling to Dartmouth in ECAC quarterfinals. Last year, the Crimson defeated Northeastern, 3-2, in the consolation game and then continued its momentum into the ECAC finals.
This year's consolation match will again be against current-No. 13 BU, which lost to the Huskies, 3-2, in the semifinals of the Beanpot and has struggled since its collapse to Harvard at home, where it gave up a three-goal third period lead to eventually lose in overtime. Since the loss at the hands of the Crimson, the Terriers have gone 2-4-1.
BU’s leading goal scorer is senior Wade Megan, who has 12, while sophomore Cason Hohmann and freshman Danny O’Regan—brother of Crimson sophomore Tommy—lead the team in total scoring with 23 and 22 points, respectively.
“The Beanpot consolation game, it's never a fun game to play in, but it can be a little bit of a springboard for the stretch run,” Donato said. “We're going to be playing a very good BU team, so that can give us some confidence moving forward."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though our Eli friends haven’t lacked for bad press in the past couple of years, I would like to open the spring term’s first edition of Around The Ivies with the, well, bad press currently coming out of New Haven.
Last Friday night, Yale’s men’s basketball team traveled to Cambridge to take on its sworn enemies in Lavietes Pavilion and left predictably humbled. As Crimson fans reveled in the Bulldogs’ defeat, punctuated by Yale forward Nick Victor’s thunderous failure of a dunk attempt, I wondered what my compatriots at the Yale Daily News had to say about the affair.
Not much of anything, as it turned out. The Yale Daily News produced one article for the basketball team’s two weekend games against Harvard and Dartmouth. The author of the article, Alex Eppler, did a fine job concisely capturing each of Yale’s faceplants over the weekend, but come on, YDN, you couldn’t get the guy a train ticket? Perhaps they’re onto something; eschewing coverage of “popular” sports like football and basketball, they will be better able to focus their pens on trendy, buzz-generating topics like yoga competitions or Ph.D. funding policy.
This brings me to that curiosity of the Ivy League social media world that is @YDNsports, the Yale Daily News sports section’s Twitter account. Its live coverage of Friday night’s rivalry showdown between Harvard and Yale consisted of retweets of the Harvard Athletics, THC Sports, and Ivy Hoops Online Twitter feeds, all occurring in the final five minutes of regulation. I imagine the good people at the YDN were adhering to one of their two cardinal rules of basketball coverage: “we step up when it counts” or “what time is the game?"
But the most thrilling moment of the week in @YDNsports was undoubtedly its performance on Feb. 5, when it officially went rogue. Astutely noting the lack of Tuesday midday Ivy sports activities, the P.R. wizard operating the account deemed it prudent to “live tweet [his or her] field trip to the Yale cogen plant.” For those of you who didn’t receive this month’s issue of Electrical and Thermal Energy Quarterly, a cogeneration, or “cogen,” plant is a power plant where electricity, heat, and steam hang out and save energy, or something. Inexplicably, the phrase “cogen plant” did not begin trending worldwide, despite the broad appeal of such a topic with all of @YDNsports’ 234 Twitter followers. I can assure you that the six current Crimson staff writers that proudly count themselves among the “Lucky 234” were riveted.
HARVARD V. CORNELL
It’s Tommy Amaker’s annual challenge: how to keep his players away from the sensual attractions of the Ithaca nightlife, most of all Kuma Charmers, the premier gentleman’s club in all of the Finger Lakes National Forest metropolitan area. There are even dark rumors of one Harvard team’s boozy late-night trip to the Women’s Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls. Ithaca, baby.
Pick: Harvard
DARTMOUTH V. COLUMBIA
According to Ken Pomeroy’s college basketball rankings, which are based on Pythagorean expectation, Dartmouth is the 286th best team in Division I basketball, the worst in the Ivy League. Yet the Big Green has performed relatively not awful in conference play thus far, playing Harvard tough twice and defeating Yale by nine. I’m giving this one to the Lions, but don’t think I’ve forgotten you, Gabas Maldunas. Your delightful fragility at the free throw line helped preserve the Crimson’s undefeated Ivy record.
Pick: Dartmouth
YALE V. PENN
For me, the most stunning moment of Harvard’s triumph over Yale on Friday was when I glanced at the game program and noticed that the Bulldogs featured a player named Armani Cotton on their roster. I guess it’s most likely that this was an intentional move on the part of his parents, but I choose to believe Mr. and Mrs. Cotton put their son’s christening in the hands of a random word generator and were blessed with a smooth, cosmopolitan-sounding name. Their other children, Minute Fertilizer and Stampede Moustache, were not nearly so fortunate.
Pick: Yale
BROWN V. PRINCETON
The coolest thing by far about Brown’s basketball program is that its associate head coach is TJ Sorrentine, the Vermont graduate best known for sealing the Catamounts’ 2005 NCAA tournament upset of Syracuse with one of the most arrogantly awesome three-point attempts I’ve ever seen, a 30-foot intercontinental missile of a shot with eight seconds left on the shot clock. Sorrentine might have to throw on a jersey and launch a few of those bombs if the Bears are to have any shot in Jadwin Gymnasium.
Pick: Princeton
HARVARD V. COLUMBIA
This has the potential to be the most competitive game of the weekend. The Lions’ three conference losses have come by a combined 13 points, and they battled to a respectable six-point defeat at Princeton last Saturday. The Crimson hasn’t exactly been convincing in their last few games, either. Columbia took Harvard to overtime in New York last year, and on the back end of a long road trip, I foresee some serious upset possibilities.
Pick: Columbia
YALE V. PRINCETON
Early on, it’s looking like a two-horse race for Ivy League Player of the Year between Harvard’s Wes Saunders and the Tigers’ Ian Hummer, who is averaging 15.9 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game, good for second, fifth, and third in the conference, respectively. Hummer is also probably evil, given that he scowls a lot and wears an arm sleeve. I hope both teams lose this game.
Pick: Princeton
BROWN V. PENN
At 4-16, the Quakers have already exceeded their loss total in each of the past two seasons. As members of the nouveau riche class of Ivy men’s basketball, it’s fun for the Crimson faithful to watch old money teams like Penn trade in their Audi for a 1997 two-door Chevrolet Cavalier. Oh, by the way, the passenger-side window doesn’t work, Quaker. And you’re going to lose to Brown.
Pick: Brown
DARTMOUTH V. CORNELL
It’s the first installment of the battle of the Big Colors, and I couldn’t be more indifferent to the result. I know it’s questionable for a fellow chromatically-nicknamed institution to throw stones, but think of the other verdant things Dartmouth bypassed on its way to “Big Green”: dragons, snakes, lizards, all much more vicious than a hue that evokes “springtime” or “envy.” They deserve to lose just for that.
Pick: Cornell

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team withstood a late Cornell run on Friday night, hanging on for a 67-65 win in Ithaca, N.Y.
The Crimson, which led by 21 with 16:55 left and 15 with 4:21 to go, failed to score the rest of the way, and the Big Red came within a single shot of handing Harvard its first Ivy League setback of the season.
But Errick Peck’s three-point attempt at the buzzer bricked off the glass, and the Crimson held on for the two-point win.
“We did some wonderful things, and it’s really disappointing to see how we let that lead get away from us and had to battle right there to the end,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Friday’s contest marked the Crimson’s fifth straight conference win by 10 points or fewer and the third straight in which Harvard nearly coughed up a sizeable lead.
With the win, the Crimson (13-7, 5-1 Ivy) remains atop the Ancient Eight standings, a half game ahead of Princeton (11-8, 4-1). Every other team has at least three league losses.
But Harvard did all it could in the final 4:21 to cede its position atop the conference standings.
Harvard shot 0 of 3 from the field, 0 of 1 from the free throw line, and turned it over twice down the stretch. Cornell shot four of six during the same stretch, closing out the contest on a 13-0 run.
“When the pressure turned up and the crowd got involved in it, we came unglued again,” Amaker said.
Following a Christian Webster three-pointer with 4:21 remaining, Peck got the run started for the Big Red with a pair of free throws. Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers missed a step-back jumper on the other end, and sophomore Jonah Travis was whistled for a foul going for the rebound, sending the Big Red back to the line.
Cornell’s Galal Cancer knocked down both free throws, and Amaker opted to take a timeout with 3:34 to play.
Facing intense Big Red pressure, sophomore Wesley Saunders coughed it up near midcourt, and Cornell’s Shonn Miller cashed in a breakaway dunk to pull the Big Red within 10 for the first time since the first half.
The Crimson got the ball to forward Steve Moundou-Missi on the other end, but the sophomore was rejected by Miller. Johnathan Gray collected the rebound and pushed it up the court, where he converted a layup to pull the Big Red within seven, 67-60, with 2:34 remaining.
Miller came up with another steal, this time taking the ball from junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, and Gray knocked down a triple from the left wing to make it a four-point game.
Coming out of a timeout, the Crimson put the ball in the hands of Saunders, but strong Cornell defense forced a miss with the shot clock expiring.
Miller came up with the rebound and missed a three-point attempt on the other end, but Peck was there for the offensive board. The senior finished a put-back layup to pull the Big Red within two with 42 seconds remaining.
The Crimson successfully inbounded the ball against the Cornell pressure and Chambers milked the shot clock near midcourt.
With 11 ticks remaining, Cornell’s Miles Asafo-Adjei fouled Chambers, sending the rookie to the line to shoot a one-and-one. Chambers, who entered the contest shooting over 85 percent from the charity stripe, missed the front end.
Peck pulled down the miss and pushed the ball up the court. With three seconds remaining, Peck launched a triple from the top of the key that would have given the Big Red its first lead of the contest and the win, but the ball caromed off the backboard and the Crimson emerged with the victory.
Excluding its offensive woes down the stretch, the Crimson had success against the Big Red defense, shooting 55.1 percent from the field—its fourth best clip of the season—and 44.4 percent from beyond the arc.
Chambers led Harvard offensively with 18 points and 11 assists. Webster contributed a season-high 17 points, connecting on 5 of 11 three-point attempts. The Crimson’s lone senior knocked down two critical threes with 5:14 and 4:21 remaining, extending Harvard’s lead from 11 to 15.
“Some of the shots he made weren’t necessarily open,” Amaker said. “He made some really tough shots at the end of the shot clock.”
Saunders and Moundou-Missi also finished in double-figures, contributing 14 and 11 points, respectively.
The pair played a critical role in the game’s opening minutes, scoring 10 of the Crimson’s first 12 points, as Harvard jumped out to an early 12-3 advantage.
The Big Red pulled within two, 12-10, off a John Figini layup with 12:15 remaining. But Harvard responded with a 19-6 run—fueled by two Webster triples and seven Chambers points—to go up by 15, 31-16.
The Crimson went into the break up 16, 38-22. Harvard’s lead grew to as many as 21 following a Chambers triple with 16:55 to go before the Big Red started to chip away at the lead.
Coming off the bench, Peck posted a team-high 17 points on 7-of-13 shooting. Miller added 13 points, and Gray chipped in with 12.

February 6, 1926: Young Tutors and an Old Adage
It has often been remarked that the important thing in education is not the doctrine taught but the awakening of the student. The tutorial system is a recognition of this truth. The most important benefit conferred by the direct contact between a student and a tutor is just this: that the student may receive a new stimulus to intellectual development and respond to it by what is truly an awakening of his more or less dormant powers. The tutorial system not only is a powerful instrument for effecting such a transformation, but is helping to bring it about earlier in the student's career than was formerly possible.
February 7, 1953: Corporation Ups College Tuition to $800; Sports Fees, Tickets Included; Costs Hiked In GSAS, Education, Public Administration
Provost Buck's tuition recommendations were approved in full, the Corporation revealed yesterday. The new tuition fee for both the College and Radcliffe will be $800, beginning next fall.
At the same time, tuition in the Graduate Schools of Arts and Sciences, Education, and Public Administration jumped from $600 to $700 for full-time study and from $100 to $200 for reduced study at an advanced level. No action has been taken yet by the Law, Medical, Divinity, Design, and Public Health Schools.
 
February 9, 1961: Protest of Bomb Shelter Greeted by Public Apathy
A picket line organized in front of the Massachusetts State House to protest the proposed construction of a state nuclear bomb shelter drew little response yesterday from an apathetic Boston.
Over 70 persons joined in the demonstration sponsored by the Greater Boston Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. Robert E. Well '61, head of Harvard's Tocsin organization, estimated that 15-20 of the picketers were from the University.
The picketing itself was orderly and quiet. Demonstrators marched in a large oval carrying signs that read: "Man is not a mole," "Keep man out of a hole," and "Civil Defense is not defense."
 
February 8, 1965: University Introduces New Iranian Courses 
A Russian citizen, a Zoroastrian priest, and a Cambridge University lecturer will give Harvard's first courses on modern Iranian literature, religion, and history this semester.
Reshat M. Aliyev will teach Iranian 176, Persian Literature. Aliyev is the first Russian citizen to give a regular course at Harvard, according to Richard N. Frye, Aga Khan Professor of Iranian.
Peshotan Anklesaria, who is offering the History of Zoroastrianism at the Center for World Religions, is the first University instructor to be a Zoroastrian priest.
February 4, 1978: Drugs Sold Here Laced with PCP Cause Severe Reactions in Students
Several undergraduates who experienced severe physical and psychological reactions after ingesting illegal drugs purchased in Cambridge have caused University administrators to fear an increased distribution of marijuana and LSD laced with harmful synthetic hallucinogens.
During exam period two students were treated and released after they smoked marijuana purchased on campus that they believe was "dusted" with either angel dust, the alcohol extract of marijuana, or PCP, a synthetic amphetamine derivative also used as a horse tranquilizer, Archie C. Epps III, dean of students, said yesterday.
Dr. Paul A. Walters Jr., chief of psychiatry at the University Health Services, said yesterday that although no cases of treated marijuana have been brought to his attention, there is evidence of an alarming reemergence of "bad acid," especially LSD laced with speed derivatives such as PCP.
