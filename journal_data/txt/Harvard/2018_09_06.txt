Oisa Ramen Slurp & Go may be a tiny restaurant, but it punches way above its weight-class when it comes time to eat. The little ramen shop, which opened at 2 Broad Street in Downtown Boston this January, seats around 10, deriving its energy from its intimacy. More specifically, it is fueled by the closeness between chef Moe Kuroki, her cooking, and her customers. Kuroki is also the shop’s owner and the creator of all its recipes. She runs the kitchen mostly solo. She talks amiably with the counter-sitters while she cooks, sometimes pausing her movements to reflect on a philosophical matter, and seems to imbue just as much warmth and thought into her chats as she does into her food. The inside of the restaurant is a sunny, pale yellow box, open for lunch on weekdays and for dinner on Thursdays and Fridays. On a recent day, the word “OPEN” had been drawn playfully into the fog on the window. Despite the minimalism, or maybe because of it, the experience could not be homelier.
The restaurant’s smallness also means that Kuroki can apply her artist’s eye to every bowl, and it shows. In the Oisa Tonkotsu ($14), five fragile pork slices are fanned out and adorned by a ribbon of sesame seeds. A tricolor flag of scallions, pickled mustard greens, and bright red pickled ginger perches atop the noodles, and a soft boiled egg serves as a focal point for the composition. The velvety, understated broth provides a backdrop for each taste to take its turn in a moment of epiphany. The thin pork slices are so angelically soft that they might be soufflé rather than meat, while the crunch of the pickled ginger leads to a delightful throat-stinging encounter. At first, these eclectic flavors are confined to their respective ingredients, but the broth becomes spicier over the course of the meal as the other elements saturate it.
None of the richness is lost when Kuroki forgoes the meat and egg. In her vegan Smoky Shoyu ($9) dish, the shiitake mushroom is not the only asset. The vegan noodles, in which tomato powder replaces egg whites, have a wonderfully springy texture. The shiitake mushroom enthroned atop this tasty bowl is a force to be reckoned with. As hearty in texture as any slab of meat, the mushroom cap brings to the meal a surprising, almost spicy intensity. In that way, it’s not unlike Oisa Ramen itself—an unassuming, cute, compact source of culinary power. Ramen without meat is not traditional, so the vivacity of her vegan dish feels like a gesture inviting any diner to feel at home.
The entire menu consists of three ramen types to eat in-house—one pork, one vegetarian, and one vegan—and three Donburi rice bowls for takeout. Everything costs between $9 and $14, and customers can pay more for truffled mushroom, soy egg, pork belly, and other extras.
Curiously, though Oisa Ramen technically shares the 2 Broad Street amenities with its much larger, louder neighbor Tiki Rock, its website lists its location as “1 3/4 Broad Street.” This fraction might merely be meant to guide visitors to the correct door. However, it might also be a reference to “Harry Potter,” aptly suggesting that Oisa Ramen is an easily-overlooked platform that kicks off a magical journey. As the restaurant’s name suggests, it is possible to order, slurp, and leave quickly. However, to not revel in the startling tastes and comforting aura would be a missed opportunity.

It’s barely noon on a Sunday in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, where the skies are moody and misty, and the makeshift stadiums are relatively bare for the Outside Lands music festival. Its star-studded lineup tends to attract crowds later in the day, when showstopping musicians like Janet Jackson or Portugal. The Man are scheduled to perform.
But the last day of the music festival starts at noon with a 25-minute set. A band of six recent Berklee College graduates—formally known as Ajna—walked onto Lands End stage taking their respective places behind microphones and drums. “What’s up San Francisco?” lead singer and founder Felipe Maldonado asked the meager crowd. “Let’s get this party started!”
Ajna got its start in Boston, Massachusetts, where the Berklee College of Music is based. Their origin story is partly why a relatively new college band with just one, five-song-long EP was able to perform at the main stage at Outside Lands, San Francisco’s largest music festival—headliner Florence + the Machine had just performed in Ajna’s very spot the previous night.
Their Outside Lands performance was orchestrated by the Berklee Popular Music Institute (BPMI), which sends artists from the college to perform at music festivals in both the United States and Canada. This summer, they’ve sent students to Chicago’s Lollapalooza and New Orleans’ Essence Festival, among others. Ajna was one of seven groups out of 300 submissions chosen to perform on BPMI’s summer tour.
Ajna is the third-eye chakra in Hindu tradition. For these musicians, Ajna is their unifier, a great source of influence for their music, according to Maldonado. “We don’t take the [original definition] too literally. It’s just a representation of different kinds of realities that can exist aside from what we see,” he says. “Those realities are like dreams.”
This principle ends up manifesting in an eccentric, indie-electronic songs. They’re psychedelic, existential, and sometimes a little angst-ridden. “Often times / I get caught into the feeling / that there is no space / and I said mom / am I blind / or am I dreaming?” Maldonado sings in “Caught in the Feeling,” a song off of Ajna’s EP “Uncensored Space” and the third piece to their five-song setlist. “But they all just say I'm / I'm out of my mind.” By now, the crowd has doubled in size.
Normally, the band has Maldonado on vocals and guitar, Saguiv Rosenstock on guitar, Carlo de Biaggio on bass, Tommaso Taddonio on keys and synthesizer, Zak Icaza on drums, Aaron Kennedy on backing vocals and an OP1 sampler. But for this particular set, Sidney Bichet took Tadonio’s place behind the keyboard.
For the members of Ajna, who just graduated, the journey with Berklee ends here. “They’ll just call us for alumni donations now,” Kennedy jokes. He mentions that if there’s one thing that he wants people to know about Ajna, it’s that they record live.
“The core of the songs are recorded in the studio very similar to how we performed on stage today,” Kennedy says.
At the end of the show, Ajna closed with “The Pineal”: “You can lucid / You can expand and explore / or you can listen / to those who said before.” Audience members started pulling out their phones and recording. The set ended, and the band threw Ajna-branded pins into the crowd, which people grabbed madly at. “One more song!” someone next to me shouted. “One more song!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, some have called for the elimination of the work expectation from students’ financial aid packages. Harvard College would be wrong to comply.
I received nearly full financial aid at the College. I also chose to work five out of eight semesters.
When I would receive my weekly paycheck, I found myself reflecting on how thankful I was to receive, in grants from the College, more than 20 times my working income. My job reminded me just how valuable my education actually was. It gave me something substantive to talk about during interviews. And it allowed me to meet some great friends with whom I still keep in touch.
According to the College’s net price calculator, Harvard will cover 100 percent of billed expenses, including tuition, room, and board, for families with less than $65,000 in yearly income. Personal expenses, books, and travel expenses — estimated at approximately $4,600 per year — are generally not covered by financial aid, but aid calculations can sometimes change depending on travel costs. Though actual numbers may fluctuate slightly from the above, they’re close enough for argument’s sake.
So, I’d like to clear up a misconception, which is that there is some hidden “annual fee” payable to the College, even for students who are promised full financial aid. This is simply not true. In reality, the College just asks students to pay independent vendors (like CVS) for normal living expenses: getting a haircut, buying laundry detergent, taking the T.
These are the expenses that work expectations are designed to pay. Students who work on campus jobs are paid in cash and, in my experience, above a fair market rate for the work they do. Students have complete discretion on how to use this money. This work expectation is not conspiratorial or inappropriate.
It does feel odd that the parents of wealthy students may pay for these expenses while poorer students must resort to work or loans. But I do believe there’s value in having some “skin in the game.” My work arrangement certainly made me a more serious student and helped me become a better citizen and citizen-leader. Moreover, Harvard does not have an infinite supply of money, despite popular opinion to the contrary. Everything has an opportunity cost: The approximately six million dollars that it would take to offer an additional $4,600 per year to the 20 percent of College students on full financial aid could pay for the full tuition, room, and board of an additional 25 or so students per class.
I’m not advocating for the status quo, and critics of the financial aid system have fair points. Books are the most egregious exclusion from financial aid coverage. Travel estimates are laughably low. Affording food when the dining halls shut down is still challenging. Start-up grants are a fabulous idea. But a blank check that eliminates work expectations is not the answer.
I am profoundly thankful to the generations of alumni who made Harvard possible for me. Our donors have already paid for the entirety of a Harvard College education — let’s do our part to meet them halfway, not ask them for spring break tickets too.

Work-life balance. It’s the Northwest Passage of the Harvard experience. Everyone talks about it, and we’re all searching for it, but does it really exist? Yes! Maybe? Sometimes if the weather is just right. But here’s the thing: It’s real. I’ve experienced it for myself. It was fleeting, but like the survivor of an alien abduction, I now know what’s out there.
Over the summer, I had an internship that showed it to me. And no, it wasn’t some blow-off job where I could easily prioritize life over work. My work-life “formula” wasn’t 20 percent work, 80 percent life. The difference between this full-time job and the full-time job of being a Harvard student was that my internship ended when I walked out of the office each evening. During the summer, I could get on a bus and go home, leaving work aside until the next morning. I found the ideal balance because I could institute a distinct separation between my job and my personal life.
At Harvard, especially because the vast majority of students live in on-campus housing, it’s nearly impossible to feel like you’re going home at the end of the day. We may only go to class for a few hours a day, but class persistently follows us around for the remaining hours of daylight and far into the night. We have lunch with our friends, and class is sitting on our shoulder reminding us to hurry up and get to the library. We go to the gym, and class is chasing us and yelling about our midterm next week. We take a nap, and class infiltrates our dreams with scenarios of tests we didn’t study for. We are constantly contained within the physical space of school and surrounded by people with the same school-centric mindset. It can feel nearly impossible to create any sort of balance when the boundaries between work and life have completely dissolved.
Is a blended social-professional lifestyle the only option for college students? There is no getting around the fact that academics have to take a central role in our lives. Nevertheless, I believe there is a way to keep our focus on academic success without allowing it to melt into every aspect of our lives.
The key is to set self-imposed work hours. It doesn’t have to be nine to five, but defining a consecutive schedule and confining all academic hours (including class, lab, studying, and homework) to that time slot may both force productivity and permit for down time. For when the end of your “work day” rolls around, you get to set the books aside and commit wholeheartedly to the activities, or non-activities, that give you joy: spending time with friends, reading for pleasure, playing a musical instrument, exercising, watching Netflix, sleeping. The list goes on and on.
We are allowed to have lives that are separate and distinct from our studies. In the mad rush of the semester, it can be easy to forget this little fact. We may feel guilty for taking time away from homework to enjoy ourselves. Establishing clear boundaries between work and life can give us the freedom to exercise this right without falling behind academically.
Here’s the catch: This whole method relies entirely on commitment. No one is going to stop you from falling asleep at 1 p.m. and then cramming until 3 a.m. to compensate. You have to set a schedule and hold yourself accountable. I must admit that I haven’t perfected this method yet. We’re all fallible, and it’s ok to fall behind sometimes. But just getting started by  having the goals in mind can be a road to improvement.
Pre-set work hours can be the key to finding that elusive work-life balance. Imagine it: You go to work in the morning, get a lot done during the day, but you still have plenty left over for the next day. Instead of feeling bad until it’s all done — until you finish your last final — you set it aside completely when your work hours finish. You go about your evening free of anxieties and pressure, indulging in the things that make you who you are.
It feels pretty good, doesn’t it?

An undergraduate consulting organization has granted $10,000 to 13 Harvard affiliates and groups to advance sustainability initiatives this year.
Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment consults companies in the technology, life sciences, and sustainability fields. CBE launched the grant program this year, opening applications in the spring and selecting the recipients based on the viability and impact of their pitched initiatives.
President Kevin Stephen ’20 said the organization spearheaded the program after its members expressed their belief in the “moral imperative” of using the club’s resources to help people. He said the board saw a chance to use revenue gained from the club’s “explosive growth” over the past couple of years to support the Harvard community.
“We thought there was a strong opportunity for us to help a lot of people,” Stephen said. “We have a lot of small, environmental groups on campus that are doing great work, but that didn’t really have the resources or the capital to make a strong impact.”
Managing Director Dhruv Gupta ’20 said grants ranged from a few hundred dollars to almost $2000.
Gupta said he has been “really excited” to hear about the ways the recipients have used the grant.
“It's really cool to see even the small amount of money we may have given out have a large impact on the individuals or the people that they helped," he said.
One of the grant recipients was Refresh Bolivia, a 501c(3) nonprofit building health infrastructure, education, and research in the country.
Executive Director Akshay Swaminathan ’19 said the grant would go toward “our biggest and most ambitious project to date” — building a community health clinic in Cochabamba, Bolivia.
Swaminathan said the funds would help equip the clinic with “critical” medical equipment including weighing scales, thermometers, and over-the-counter drugs.
“What makes this clinic special is that it address various barriers in healthcare — physical, economic, and linguistic,” Swaminathan said. He noted that without the clinic, residents would have to travel for two hours to the city center, where “they may not even find affordable medicine.”
Another recipient, the Harvard Social Innovation Collaborative, is using the grant money to reimburse speakers and panelists for its ninth Igniting Innovation Summit, the largest undergraduate-run conference about social innovation.
Summit Co-Director Connie Cai ’21 said the grant allows the summit to “continue having as much reach as before.”
“I don’t think we would have been able to get as many really high-profile speakers and people from a lot of different backgrounds if not for this grant,” she said.
Cai said she thought it was “really nice” that a Harvard organization is helping other clubs on campus.
“The grant program is really cool,” Cai said. “I’ve never heard of a student organization giving grants to another student organization before.”
Christina M. Bear ’20 applied for the grant on behalf of BubbleBox, a mobile hygiene unit aimed to help migrants, refugees, and the homeless. Bear said the team will use the funding to build a minimal viable product.
“We’ve really enjoyed being a part of this initial sustainability grant,” Bear said. “Not only has the money been helpful, but so have the connections we’ve been able to make with CBE and other organizations.”
Stephen said he hopes to expand the grant program in the future.
“We'll definitely do something similar to this next year and expand the program to give out more grants,” he added.

In a launch celebration at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School students unveiled a photography exhibit highlighting stories of Boston-area individuals affected by the opioid epidemic.
The exhibit, titled “RESILIENT: Narratives of Hope From Boston’s Opioid Crisis,” contains 31 individual portraits and lines a hallway at the hospital. Its subjects include Louis Cherubino, supervisor of the Cambridge Police Department’s opioid response initiative, and Monica Bharel, Massachusetts commissioner of public health, according to the press release for the exhibit.
Event organizers said a desire to highlight the complexity of substance use and addiction compelled them to organize the event in concert with other medical students.
“This project was really an attempt to explore what is often not said, what is not in the public eye. A lot of stories of addiction portray a very singular narrative of what that could look like,” said Mimi Yen Li, a Medical School student who co-directed the project.
“A lot of the coverage of the opioid crisis has actually been from people who haven’t experienced it themselves,” said Joyce C. Zhou, a Medical School student and project co-director. “It was really important for us to try to highlight those stories and hear from the people themselves.”
The event organizers said they plan to bring the exhibit to Harvard Medical School and possibly other venues in the future.
As dozens of students, doctors, and residents filled the mezzanine, a series of speakers including doctors and substance abuse patients addressed the crowd to introduce the project.
Scott G. Weiner, an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women’s, opened by describing how treatment for substance abuse has changed in recent years. When he first began treating substance abuse patients, he said, patients received little support upon hospital release.
Joji Suzuki, an addiction psychiatrist at Brigham and Women’s, said when he started at the hospital 10 years ago, he was the only addiction specialist in the entire Longwood area.
“It was very common for patients to be told that ‘we don’t do that here,’” he said. “Today, when a patient is looking for treatment, we can confidently say, ‘you’ve called the right place, we can help you.’”
Finally, Ursel Hughes, a patient photographed in the exhibit, spoke about her experiences with addiction and substance abuse.
“It’s truly a privilege and an honor to share your experience, strength, and hope, which has been denied to too many,” she said. “I challenge you to support others, whether they are sick and suffering coming off the street, or whether they are uneducated around the disease model of thinking about addiction.”
Faculty and students on Harvard’s Longwood campus have been focusing on the opioid epidemic in recent months as the issue gains increasing regional and national attention. In April, the School of Public Health invited five former governors to speak about state-level responses to the epidemic.

The Harvard University Police Department is investigating two separate thefts in freshman dorms over the past two weeks, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano announced in an email to University affiliates Wednesday.
Several residents of Holworthy Hall notified HUPD Wednesday that while they were asleep someone “climbed through their first floor common room window and stole laptops, wallets, and an iPad,” Catalano wrote. On August 28 — less than 24 hours after the Class of 2022 arrived on campus — a freshman in Mower reported that, while he had been asleep the previous night, someone raised the screen on his open window and took a laptop from a nearby desk.
HUPD does not know if these burglaries are connected, per Catalano’s email. He urged anyone who has information about the thefts to contact the department.
James F. Mooney ’22, the Mower resident whose computer was stolen, said he felt concerned when he realized his laptop had been stolen, but feels “glad this happened during the first week of school and not finals week.”
“I’m glad we all learned, in our entryway, the lesson pretty early of how to keep our room secure,” Mooney said.
The burglaries have since prompted some freshmen on the first floors of Holworthy and Mower to take additional precautions.
Douglass A. Bryant ’22, who lives on the first floor of Holworthy, said the first thing he did after learning about the robberies was lock his windows.
“I don’t think it’s going to be an ongoing problem, but it just keeps it fresh in your mind, that you have to be on guard,” he said. “You’re not living in a total bubble. There’s stuff you have to look out for.”
Theo P. Lukin Yelin ’22, whose dorm is on the first floor of Mower, said he thought it was “pretty weird” that a robbery occurred on the first night of school.
“It makes you look twice before leaving the room but other than that, it’s not like it’s been happening every night so far,” he said.
In his email, Catalano urged Harvard affiliates not to prop doors open, to keep their rooms locked, to close their windows when leaving the room, and to “keep all property away from windows.”
He declined to comment Wednesday on whether HUPD is taking additional steps to prevent future burglaries.
“It is the longstanding policy of the HUPD not to comment on staffing levels or security measures,” Catalano wrote.

Massachusetts marijuana retailers have accused the state's Cannabis Control Commission of failing to enforce legal limits restricting how much municipalities can charge the businesses annually to operate.
In order for a marijuana retailer to open in Massachusetts, it must negotiate a “host community agreement,” or contract, with its municipality. These host community agreements dictate how much the retailer must pay its municipality each year in the form of a “community impact fee” to keep its doors open. Retailers have criticized these agreements, saying small businesses may struggle to open and operate in the face of these high costs.
Massachusetts legalized marijuana in 2016, and July 1 of this year marked the first day pot shops could legally sell the drug. State law requires that retailers go through a vetting process before they can open their doors, however. The Cambridge City Council has begun the zoning and licensing process, and it held a hearing on a zoning petition last month.
Current Massachusetts law mandates that the maximum fee municipalities may charge retailers is three percent of their annual revenue. Across the state, though, municipalities often charge additional fees on top of this three percent. These annual charges are intended to mitigate the potentially negative impacts that marijuana retailers might have on their communities, according to guidance documents produced by the commission.
James E. Smith, a partner at Smith, Costello and Crawford — a law firm that represents marijuana businesses — said marijuana retailers lack bargaining power in negotiating host community agreements, allowing municipalities to charge higher rates.
“[The municipalities] have all the leverage,” Smith said. “Either we sign that agreement, or we don't open. We have no business. It's a very one-sided negotiation.”
Kamani Jefferson, president of the Massachusetts Recreational Consumer Council, said the host community agreements often determine whether marijuana businesses succeed or fail.
“We're concerned with and disappointed about this decision,” Jefferson said of the Cannabis Control Commission’s vote. “The host community agreement is where your business can be made or broken in this industry in Massachusetts. So the fact that some of them aren’t adhering to what the law says is very concerning, especially for smaller businesses looking to jump into the industry.”
In response to these criticisms, Maryalice A. Gill, a press secretary for the Cannabis Control Commission, wrote in an emailed statement that the Commission “continues to gather data on this issue and has published guidance to help municipalities and applicants work cooperatively to structure host community agreements in compliance with state law.”
Since lawmakers on Beacon Hill have not indicated whether they will act to enforce limits on how municipalities may charge retailers, retailers may pursue legal action in the future.
However, Smith said such a case would be far in the future, as many retailers do not currently have the funds required to bring a lawsuit against municipalities.
"I have no doubt that it will go to court eventually,” Jefferson said. “The problem we have in the marijuana industry is that nobody has any money.” The Cambridge City Council has begun the zoning and licensing process and held a hearing on a zoning petition last month.

The Cambridge Planning Board heard a marijuana dispensaries zoning petition from the City Council at a public hearing in late August, bringing the city one step closer to seeing its first pot shops.
The zoning petition proposes various conditions for retailers to be able to sell recreational marijuana in Cambridge. The petition comes after Massachusetts voters legalized recreational marijuana through a Nov. 2016 state ballot question.
Statewide sales of retail cannabis were scheduled to begin July 1, but no recreational marijuana stores were ready to operate in Massachusetts by that date.
The delayed opening was due to multiple factors, including the lack of finalized municipal regulations and necessary inspections. The City Council voted unanimously to begin drafting recreational cannabis “zoning and licensing” laws in March 2018.
For medical marijuana businesses in the area, rigorous scrutiny from city government is nothing new. Michael Dundas, president and CEO of Sira Naturals, said his organization first obtained a medical marijuana license in Feb. 2014 after an intense vetting process.
“We were very fortunate to have already have gone through not just the licensing process but already actually built out and started operations on the marijuana products production side,” he said.
Dundas said the main impediment to opening recreational marijuana stores is the approval process by both the municipality and the state.
“We’re probably looking at some time in November or December before we actually see the first retail recreational marijuana establishment open its doors to the public,” Dundas said.
According to the planning board’s presentation, the city wants to “promote distribution throughout the city” and to “avoid policies that exclude disadvantaged populations.”
The City Council will ultimately enact the final zoning changes after a three to six-month process, according to Jeff C. Roberts, zoning and development director of Cambridge’s Community Development Department.
Cambridge’s Zoning Ordinance has been amended more than 150 times since its inception in 1924, and primarily deals with how land and buildings in the city can be used. While the city ordinance is under the purview of local law, it must still follow state regulations.
To prevent “clustering” of the marijuana dispensaries, the zoning petition proposes 1,800 feet of separation between each store, unless the stores are in “core” business locations such as Harvard, Central, or Kendall Squares, in which case there can be two businesses within 1,800 feet. Potential retailers will have to build stores with a “buffer” of 500 feet away from K–12 schools and public youth recreational areas. However, the Planning Board reserved the right to decrease the buffer distance in certain case-by-case reviewed instances.
Current City Council and subcommittee meetings have also focused on ensuring recreational marijuana use does not limit access to medical marijuana. Roberts said the current petition is an “overview” and one that will require more discussion moving forward.
“We structured it so that some of the specific requirements and specific proposals can be subject to further discussion,” Roberts said. “This doesn’t necessarily have the final specifics of the proposal.”
Dundas said he hopes to work with the city to move his business forward through the “intensive” process to get a recreational license.
“We hope to work very cooperatively with the city, with the neighborhood associations in our immediate area, and we look forward to continuing that process,” Dundas said.

The Cambridge Police and Fire Departments were hard at work Wednesday afternoon to respond to a reported hydraulic leak in Harvard Square that began shortly after 3 p.m.
“A hydraulic fluid line burst from a street sweeper truck this afternoon at approximately 3:15 p.m. in the area of Mount Auburn Street and Dunster Street,” CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
As police and fire trucks patrolled the area outside the newly renovated Smith Campus Center, a street sweeper was seen traveling westbound on Mt. Auburn St, where rows of traffic cones blocked off the area.
“Due to a hydraulic spill involving a street sweeper in the area of Mt. Auburn St., please note there is a partial closure (one lane) on Mt. Auburn between JFK & Holyoke Sts, as well as #HarvardSquare feeder streets. Expect brief delays in the area,” the Cambridge Police Department tweeted Wednesday evening along with a map of the affected area.
According to Warnick, Cambridge residents can expect the police cordon to extend into Thursday morning until the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection clears the affected region.
“Officers will be on-scene for traffic control until the roadways are able to be fully reopened and the area is cleared by Mass DEP,” Warnick wrote. “This may extend into the morning hours, as the driver was not initially aware of the burst as they were conducting sweeping and oil was spread out over a number of streets in that vicinity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ninety-five incoming Harvard freshmen arrived on campus last month to participate in a new pre-orientation program option, the First-Year Retreat and Experience.
The two-year pilot program, which the College unveiled last spring, is tailored toward under-resourced students in the Class of 2022.  During the program, participants toured the campus and met with University administrators and faculty. The program also featured activities such as daily “FYREside family chats,” a silent disco, and an opening ceremony where students received personalized messages in books from Harvard faculty, alumni, and staff.
“Thursday was beginning community building, Friday was resources, Saturday was identity, understanding where you’re coming from, and things like that, and then Sunday was again community-building and reflection,” Andrew Perez ’20, a co-chair of FYRE, said.
One of the main academic highlights of the program was FYRE’s collaboration with various offices around the University, which gave students the opportunity to learn about resources on campus before classes started.
“We partnered with the Office of Career Services, the Bureau of Study Counsel, the Office of International Education, and CAMHS,” Perez said.
FYRE echoes a proposal rejected in March 2017 by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana for a “First Year Institute,” a summer pre-matriculation program designed specifically for low-income and first-generation students. But Khurana ultimately announced several months later that the College would debut a new pre-orientation program in 2018 for freshmen from "historically marginalized communities.”
FYRE’s steering committee was elected in 2017, and they began planning for the program shortly thereafter. Team leaders described working nonstop from January 2018 until the start of the program in August, at times meeting several hours each week.
“I would say there was definitely over 100 meetings that went into FYRE,” said Program Director Sade Abraham. “We really relied on focusing on four kind of main goals, which is navigational capital, academic capital, social capital, and agency capital.”
Sheila De La Cruz ’22, a first-year participant in FYRE, said the pre-orientation program supplemented her introduction to Harvard beyond the standard Opening Days programming, the orientation attended by the entire freshman class.
“Opening Days, it was more like a group of booths that we could visit, but with FYRE they actually took us there to each of the resources,” De La Cruz said. “People talked to us, and then they gave detailed information about what we needed to do.”
Huong Le ’22 mentioned a similar feeling.
“I think if it weren't for FYRE, I'd be a more lost freshman right now because I don't know which resources to come to, which office or who to reach out to,” Le said.
Team leaders also said they found FYRE to be a valuable experience.
FYRE team leader Gina Cusing ’20 said her own search for community as an undergraduate motivated her to get involved in the program.
“I didn't find that [community] until my junior year, and the opportunity to be able to give that to freshman three years earlier than I got it was amazing and absolutely invaluable, and that is why I applied,” Cusing said.
Other members of the steering committee said their participation in FYRE extended their work on campus supporting students from underrepresented groups.
“I’ve been very conscious of the people who are missing, and the people who their intersectional identity isn’t really catered to by anyone or group,” FYRE co-chair James Bedford ’20 said.
“I was very interested in this program as an opportunity for those students who are first-generation, low-income, like myself, or from an underrepresented high school, also like myself, or anything else to be on campus,” he added.
First-years said they felt FYRE’s programming succeeded in its goals of making them feel confident and comfortable on campus.
“A lesson that stuck out was, there's definitely going to be hurdles and challenges, but there will always be people that are by our side when we need help, just like the resources that they offered and even the team leaders, the FYRE coordinators and the friends that I made at FYRE,” Le said.
Ibrahim Ibrahim ’22, another participant in FYRE, said he values the connections made with other students, specifically upperclassmen team leaders.
“The program established one-on-one relationships with upperclassmen, team leaders, who genuinely cared about us, who gave us advice on how to navigate the space,” he said. “I think they did a good job in that, by having the students run it, not people who are disconnected from the experience.”
Katie W. Steele, an administrator who was involved in the development of the program, said she is excited for the future of FYRE.
“From my conversations with FYRE participants, they tell me they feel connected, ready, and supported, which is absolutely how I had hoped they would feel after participating in the program,” Steele said.
“We are looking forward to reviewing the feedback participants have provided so that we can build upon this success as we plan for the Class of 2023,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two organizations led in part by members of Harvard final clubs spent $90,000 in the second quarter of 2018 lobbying for a bill that could imperil the College’s social group sanctions, according to public filings.
One of the organizations — the Cambridge Coalition, which includes the all-male final clubs the Fly Club, the AD Club, and the Porcellian Club — specifically formed to fight the sanctions. The other, the Fraternal Government Relations Coalition, includes umbrella Greek organizations the North American Interfraternity Conference and the National Panhellenic Conference, in addition to the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee.
Both groups spent the same amount in the second quarter of 2018 as they did in the first.
The College’s sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
The lobbying effort is centered around the PROSPER Act, a bill meant as an update to the Higher Education Act. A provision in the act could prevent colleges and universities that penalize members of single-gender social groups from receiving federal dollars.
Embattled single-gender social groups in Cambridge have latched onto this legislation as a possible means to kill the sanctions. Both graduate and undergraduate members of Harvard social groups have traveled to Washington, D.C. in recent months to urge members of Congress to vote for the bill.
The PROSPER Act in its current iteration likely would not affect Harvard. But opponents of the sanctions hope to change the wording of an amendment to the act to ensure the proposed law applies to the University.
FGRC spent $50,000 in the second quarter of 2018 on “issues related to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, including the PROSPER Act,” while the Cambridge Coalition spent $40,000, according to publicly available documents. The quarter began April 1 and ended June 30.
Both organizations have retained the D.C.-based law firm Arnold & Porter to help lead their lobbying efforts. Arnold & Porter has a strong reputation on Capitol Hill and boasts a long list of contacts inside the federal government.
Public filings show that at least one member of FGRC — FSPAC — recently funneled money to key players in the debate over the PROSPER Act. The PAC is the premier political arm for Greek organizations in the country. Created in 2005, FSPAC has sought to influence higher education laws for years. It recently inched closer to Harvard and its raging controversy over the sanctions: FSPAC added a member of the Porcellian Club to its 2017-18 board of directors.
In the first two quarters of 2018, FSPAC gave a total of $10,000 to two vocal proponents of the amendment that could imperil the sanctions. Eight thousand dollars went to Rep. Elise M. Stefanik ’06, a New York Republican, while $2,000 went to North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx.
It remains unclear whether the groups’ efforts to push for the anti-sanctions amendment will be successful. Though the PROSPER Act advanced out of committee in Dec. 2017, the entire House of Representatives has yet to vote on the legislation — and it is not known if they will do so before the upcoming midterm election.
Republicans have so far led the effort to add the social groups provision to the bill. If Democrats win a majority in November, the provision could see longer odds of eventually becoming law.
The Senate is currently in the process of drafting its version of the bill.
In an emailed statement, Kevin O’Neill, an Arnold & Porter lobbyist working for both the Cambridge Coalition and the FGRC, wrote he remains “optimistic” that the PROSPER Act — and the amendment that could endanger Harvard’s sanctions — will pass.
“Private final clubs, fraternities and sororities exist in Cambridge because students find unparalleled personal development opportunities in joining our highly-regarded single-sex organizations,” O’Neill wrote.
As final club supporters have rallied to defeat the sanctions, Harvard has not sat idly by. Then-University President Drew G. Faust wrote a letter to Stefanik in the spring of 2018 criticizing the bill. Faust also met with lawmakers to discuss the legislation multiple times during her trips to the nation’s capital.
Representatives of final clubs and social groups affected by the policy have not contacted Harvard administrators regarding the PROSPER Act, according to spokespeople from the College and University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ivy League football does not have quite the same level of pageantry and fanfare that accompanies playing in a Power Five conference, to say the least. Rabid fans do not obsess over online message boards, games are not always played in front of impressive crowds, there isn’t round-the-clock TV coverage, and rivalry games are not scheduled a decade in advance.
However, here at The Crimson we hope to provide some semblance of preseason chatter about Harvard football. Just over a week from the team’s home opener, we’ll briefly dive into the makeup of the newest members of Harvard’s squad and investigate which groups will be most crucial to the Crimson’s plans this fall.
Coach Tim Murphy and his staff brought 28 rookies on board as the Crimson looks to rebound after a disappointing 2017 campaign. The team finished 5-5, including a 3-4 record in conference play with wins against Brown, Dartmouth, and Columbia.
For a team that relied heavily on a deep senior class on the defensive end in 2017, Harvard football brought in a bevy of recruits to replenish its defense heading into 2018. The class is comprised of 12 offensive players, 14 on the defensive side, one kicker, and one punter.
In a preseason conference call, Murphy downplayed the immediate impact his freshmen will have, instead opting to describe the team as one that is characterized by senior leadership and skilled upperclassmen. Surprises do abound during any given slate of 10 games, so these first-years could be making contributions sooner than anticipated.
Quarterbacks: Luke Emge (Lancaster, Pa.), Pat Holly (Princeton, N.J.)
If sophomore Jake Smith cements himself as the team’s starter for the foreseeable future and one of his classmates (Camden Bohn or Owen Holt) steps into a backup role, Emge and Holly will be understudies for a time. That is not to mention senior Tom Stewart, who may win the starting role this season and was 30-for-51 passing in 2016 before missing time last season due to injury.
Running backs: Daniel Abraham (Randolph, Mass.), DeMarkes Stradford (Waxhaw, N.C.)
Harvard has a deep cache of running backs, but injuries can easily crop up and force younger players into crucial roles. Seniors Charlie Booker and Semar Smith and sophomores Devin Darrington and Aaron Shampklin can be expected to receive the majority of touches this season—at the outset, opportunities for Abraham and Stradford should be few and far between, but that could change in an instant.
Wide receivers: Kym Wimberly (Slidell, La.), Joe Young (Bethlehem, Pa.)
Officially there are 13 wideouts on Harvard’s roster, and Murphy enjoys incorporating his tight ends into the passing game, so like the backfield, this position is also crowded for this year’s pair of freshmen.
Tight ends/Halfbacks: Kyle Klink (Middletown, Md.), Adam Shepherd (Little Rock, Ark.)
The Crimson returns a seasoned group at one of the key positions in Murphy’s offense. Klink and Shepherd will need to work their way up the ladder as well.
Kickers/punters: Jonah Lipel (Tarzana, Calif.), Jon Sot (Clark, N.J.)
Lipel suits up behind last year’s go-to kicker, junior Jake McIntyre. The lefty McIntyre has two seasons of experience, playing all 10 games each year and nailing 81 percent of his field goals and 92 percent of his extra point attempts. With the departure of Zach Schmid, the punting spot is up for grabs, and Sot will compete with sophomore Sean McKeogh to earn that job.
Offensive line: Tom Aicardi (North Easton, Mass.), Will Christiansen (Valencia, Calif.), Spencer Rolland (Burnsville, Md.), Patrick Walsh (Sterling, Mass.)
At the risk of sounding repetitive, the offensive line is yet another position with a number of trusted and established starters, one of whom is preseason All-American Larry Allen.
Defensive line: Logan Clifton (Austin, Texas), Justin Kakala (Manteca, Calif.), Anthony Nelson (Tampa, Fl.), David Schwartz (Longmeadow, Mass.), Chris Smith (Detroit, Mich.), Jacob Sykes (Kansas City, Mo.)
This year’s defensive line is slightly younger than its counterpart on the other side of the ball. Of the 18 players listed as defensive linemen, only two are juniors. Though a senior core—including familiar names such as Stone Hart, Richie Ryan, and Alex White—remains, these freshmen will likely get significant looks this season in preparation for larger roles in ensuing seasons.
Linebackers: Jake Brown (Fredon, N.J.), Solomon Egbe (Loganville, Ga.), Truman Jones (Atlanta, Ga.), Brandon Won (Fullerton, Calif.)
This is another deep positional group. Injuries have plagued Harvard’s linebackers in recent seasons, so Murphy opted to bring in another four linebackers to match the number of sophomores at the position. Last year, the four current sophomore linebackers saw game action for at least five games each.
Secondary: Michael Burrell (Dacula, Ga.), James Herring (Dallas, Texas), David Spitz (Shelton, Conn.), Khalid Thomas (Youngsville, N.C.)
Officially, there are 14 players listed as defensive backs and four as safeties. Two of those four safeties are rookies (Burrell and Herring). This positional group is in a bit of flux following the departures of several key seniors, such as Tobe Ezeokoli, Tim Haehl, Tanner Lee, and Raishaun McGhee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team plays eight nonconference games between August 24th and September 16th. In those three-odd weeks before it travels to Penn for its Ivy opener on September 22nd, the team has a couple of goals:
1. Create effective synergy in real-time play between a young attacking corps, a new-faces backline, and a veteran netminder presence;
2. Stay healthy during the annual physical grind that sees the Crimson constantly take the field;
3. And win.
The non-Ivy games in late August and early-mid September almost serve as a test for the squad, one after the other—can Harvard, young and brimming with talent across the board, come together as it progresses through 2018? Can it gel enough to pull off big wins against quality non-conference competition? Can it respond to tough, tiring losses that inevitably accompany every season?
The 2018 campaign is now five games old and the Crimson finds itself knee-deep in the thick of uncertainty. A strong run at Providence, Boston College, and Northeastern would very well set the tone for a successful season—but a poor showing could do the opposite.
“[Our team’s synergy] has been developing really well, it’s been an interesting challenge,” senior midfielder Leah Mohammadi said. “We have ten new freshmen, so there’s so many new faces—it’s crazy trying to figure each other out as a team, but we’ve done a great job since our California trip. We’ve been playing incredibly together.”
On Sunday, Harvard locked horns with Quinnipiac, taking down the Bobcats on the road, 1-0, on freshman midfielder/forward Sophie Hirst’s second-half goal. On Wednesday night at Jordan Field, the Crimson (2-3) followed it up by dropping a 1-0 contest to the Maine Black Bears in a disappointing home loss.
MAINE 1, HARVARD 0
Maine freshman forward Emma Donovan poked home a wide-open rebound in front of the net to propel the Black Bears (2-2-1) to a 1-0 victory over Harvard, as the Crimson offense couldn’t find the back of the net despite 11 shots and seven corner kicks.
“We had a lot of the ball, but our quality was just a little off,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “I think it was a lack of quality, and I think it was a slow start—we were slow out of the gates, we let Maine get ahead of us in that regard. Credit to them, but we’ve got to be better.”
Harvard was outshot 6-2 in the first half and perhaps wasn’t quite in gear at the opening whistle. Junior goalie Kat Hess, who started and made two saves in the first half, wasn’t able to corral a rebound in the 34th minute and Donovan didn’t miss the resulting wide-open ball.
“[Maine] scored on a goal that was preventable from our standpoint, but those happen—mistakes happen,” Hamblin said. “I thought we did a lot better job in the second half, moving the ball, changing the point of attack, and opening them up a little bit.”
The Crimson had plenty of scoring chances in both halves but never put a tally on the board.
Senior forward Alli Wiggins had a nice opportunity in the 26th minute off a well-placed ball from sophomore forward Murphy Agnew, but her shot floated into the chest of Maine goalie Annalena Kriebisch. In the 42nd minute, Mohammadi’s left-footed chip shot just hit the top of the crossbar. Mohammadi and sophomore defender/midfielder Linda Liedel couldn’t find the equalizer on free kicks near the box late in the second half, either.
“Today was really good prep for us, for the Ivies, going down early and facing a new challenge, being one down in the second half,” said Mohammadi, the team’s captain and shots leader. “We played well in the second half but we went down early and didn’t have the best response in the first.”
The Black Bears defense, combined with how Maine slowed the game down in the second half, frustrated Harvard’s offense as the clock wound down. Maine’s aggressive clock management, draining time at every opportunity, also succeeded in making the Crimson’s job even more difficult.
“One thing we want to make sure of is that in the Ivy League, we don’t have one of these games,” Hamblin said. “I think we’re going to look back at this game and say, ‘we could have done better’, so we’re going to learn from it now and put the pieces in the puzzle.”
The loss marks the second time Harvard has been held goalless this season, though its previous shutout came when it mustered only one shot against Cal to open the season.
The Crimson turned up the intensity in the second half under the lights, outshooting Maine nine to one, but Donovan’s 34th minute goal stood until the final whistle.
“We’re trying to still figure each other out as a team, but we’ll build on this, and there’s a learning curve,” Mohammadi said.

HARVARD 1, QUINNIPIAC 0
Senior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel notched her second-straight individual shutout, the fourth of her career, in Harvard’s 1-0 victory over Quinnipiac (1-4) at QU Soccer Stadium in Hamden, Conn. The veteran netminder made two saves as the Crimson offense in front of her poured in 19 shots, including eight on goal.
Hirst’s goal in the 53rd minute, assisted by Agnew, was all Harvard needed to improve to 5-0 all-time against the Bobcats. The goal was the rookie’s second of the season, joining her with Mohammadi as the team’s multi-goal scorers on the season.
Agnew, the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, once again was at the center of the attack, slotting a pass through to Hirst to allow the finish. The sophomore now has a team-leading two assists on the season.
Etzel played all 90 minutes to improve to 2-2 on the season. The Crimson defense stood strong, allowed the Bobcats only five shots, two of which were on goal.
Etzel’s counterpart, Quinnipiac junior goalie Olivia Myszewski, took the loss after stopping eight shots but letting one through in 90 minutes of action.
