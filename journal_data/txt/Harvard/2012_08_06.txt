After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before the London 2012 Games Great Britain’s women’s basketball team had never played in an Olympic game. After five group-stage games, the Brits exit these Olympics winless, falling 78-66 to Brazil on Saturday night and failing to advance to the quarterfinals.
Temi Fagbenle ’15, who at just 19 years old was a surprising selection for the team, averaged about 20 minutes a game for Team GB. The 6’4” forward showed signs of her impressive talent that made her a high school All-American and the highest rated recruit to come to an Ivy League team in recent years. But at times she was out-muscled by older, more experience players. In the tournament, she averaged 4.8 points, to go with 4.0 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game.
Fabenle was forced to sit out her freshman year at Harvard due to a questionable NCAA hearing that ruled her ineligible, in part because of her decision to move from Great Britain to the United States for her last years of high school. When she eventually does take the court this winter, she and her teammates will try to break a streak of four-straight second-place finishes in the Ancient Eight.
On Tuesday, Samyr Laine ’06 of Haiti will compete in qualification in the triple jump. Mark Zuckerberg’s former freshman roommate has received attention both for his famous friend and his campaign to generate support for Haitian athletics. Should Laine qualify, his final will be on Thursday. Alex Meyer ’10, the only other Harvard Olympian yet to compete, swims in the men’s 10K open water swim on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the sports world has its eyes trained on the London Games, recent Harvard men’s hockey alums continue to make news on this side of the Pond.
After spending two years with the Buffalo Sabres’ American Hockey League affiliates, former Crimson defenseman Alex Biega ’10 will extend his stay with the organization after signing a one-year deal, the team announced Thursday night. Biega comes off a 2011-12 season with the Rochester Americans in which he scored five times while doling out 18 assists in 65 games played.
In his Harvard career, Biega twice earned the John Tudor Memorial Cup, given to the team’s most valuable player, and was named captain his senior season. Tallying 15 goals and 55 assists in 131 career games with the Crimson, Biega earned further recognition in his senior campaign for being one of three Biega brothers on the Crimson hockey team at the same time, along with Michael ’11 and Danny ’13.
Biega isn’t the only former Crimson hockey star currently playing in the AHL. Forward Alex Killorn ’12 joined the Norfolk Admirals, the affiliate of the Tampa Bay Lightning, shortly after his Harvard career came to a close. And it didn’t take long for Killorn, one of the Crimson’s most prolific scorers in the last decade, to make an impact. With six points in 10 regular season games, Killorn tacked on 12 more in postseason play to help the Admirals win the Calder Cup.
Further north, former Crimson standout Louis Leblanc saw time in the AHL with the Hamilton Bulldogs, the affiliates of the Montreal Canadiens. But unlike Killorn and Biega, Leblanc, who left Harvard following his freshman season, climbed to the pinnacle of the sport: the NHL. With the Habs, Leblanc amassed 10 points on five goals and five assists in 42 games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 3:10 P.M. ET
The Harvard men’s basketball team announced most of its 2012-13 home schedule today, with season tickets going on sale on the Athletic Department’s website.
There are no surprises in Ivy League play. Harvard and Dartmouth remain traveling partners, and all the other partnerships have stayed the same.
But the last home-weekend of the season figures to be far less exciting than those of recent years. Two years ago, Harvard beat Princeton in the last home-game of the season to capture a share of the Ivy League title and force a tie-breaker in New Haven. Last year, a Saturday night loss to Penn, following a three-point victory over the Tigers, made for nerve-racking theater as the eventual-champion Crimson saw its bid to maintain the nation’s second longest home-winning streak fall by the way side.
This year, that fateful last weekend will feature visits from Cornell and Columbia. The two New York teams figure to be better than they were last year—when both finished in the bottom of half of the Ancient Eight—but will likely fail to create the same drama as the killer P’s.
In non-conference action, the season opens with cross-town Division III rival MIT making its customary visit to Lavietes on Friday, Nov. 9. Later that month, Vermont travels to Cambridge after Harvard beat the Catamounts, 55-48, in Burlington last season.
Fordham will also visit Cambridge, trying to repeat its shocking victory over the Crimson that knocked Harvard out of the top 25 last January.
Boston University, Holy Cross, and Rice round out the non-conference schedule.
Season tickets for non-Harvard students range from $150 for students and youth to $295 for adults.
Though the full away schedule still hasn't been finalized, rumors have floated around about some high profile opponents. The release of the Memphis Tigers' official schedule confirms that the Crimson will be playing the Tigers, who have appeared in eight of the last nine NCAA tournaments, on January 19.
