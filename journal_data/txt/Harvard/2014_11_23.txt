After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through eight games, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team has shown that it likes to score early and score fast. On Friday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, the hosts had a lot to like.
The Crimson (6-1-2, 3-1-2 ECAC) scored four goals in the first 11 minutes to beat Bentley, (5-6-1, 3-2-1 Atlantic), at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Friday night.
Harvard has outscored opponents, 16-1, in the first period this year.
“I think good teams start the game on time,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s easy to play with the lead and pull teams out of what they want to do.”
Freshman defenseman Jake Horton started the early scoring for the Crimson at 1:47 with his first collegiate goal, beating senior Bentley goaltender Blake Dougherty at the crease off a feed from classmate Seb Lloyd. Junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo followed a minute later with a strike from the top of the left face-off circle.
“[Getting off to a fast start] is something that we’ve really tried to make part of our identity this whole year,” Horton said. “We want to get that first shot on net and kind of set the tone, and I think we’ve been doing a great job of that.”
After missing all of last season with post-concussion syndrome, junior forward Colin Blackwell returned to Harvard’s line-up on the second line. The San Jose Sharks draft pick registered two shots on goal and is poised to add depth to a scoring attack that has found success in the first month of the season.
The Crimson’s offensive depth was on display early. The team’s top three lines were on the ice for the first five strikes of the game.
Junior forward Jimmy Vesey stickhandled the puck at the side of the net and over Dougherty’s right shoulder to convert on Harvard’s only power play opportunity of the night at 7:08 in the first.
Junior defenseman Patrick McNally put the team up four less than three minutes later with a coast-to-coast effort, skating past the Crimson’s second line and around Bentley defenders to force a shot past the pads of backup Gabe Antoni, who relieved Dougherty for the remainder of the first period after Vesey’s strike.
Third-line sophomore center Tyler Moy put in a wrap-around attempt at 12:27 to give the Crimson its biggest lead of the game.
“We’re developing some scoring depth, and our power play did their job today.” Donato said.
Overall, it was a big night for the Crimson’s third line as Horton received the third star of the game while Lloyd received the second star for his first two career points.
“I think we play off of each other very well,” Horton said of the line. “We’re all really hard-working guys and we like to grind down low, but we also have the skill that we can make plays with. Moy arguably has the top skill set on the team.”
The game was billed as a battle of special teams. Bentley entered the game with the top power play in the country, boasting a 36.4 percent rate.  The Crimson, meanwhile, started the night a perfect 26-for-26 on the power play.
The Falcons ended Harvard’s streak at 17:01 in the second period with a 5-on-3 power play goal on a redirect from sophomore forward Max French. However, the Crimson penalty kill gave Bentley few opportunities to score on the 5-on-4, turning away all five of the visitors’ chances.
“I thought we did a good job on the 5-on-4,” Donato said. “The 5-on-3…we thought we could pull it out…but [Bentley] made a nice tip. I think that’s a good hockey team, and we were happy to get out to a lead and really establish the way that we wanted to play.”
Donato likes to say that junior goaltender Steve Michalek is Harvard’s best penalty killer. Michalek took the first star of the game with a 28-save effort, a steady performance that has become commonplace for the Minnesota Wild draft pick this season.
The Falcons forced Harvard to play a more even game in the final two periods. Both Donato and Horton see plenty of room for improvement as the team enters a challenging nonconference road double at No. 2/3 Boston University and No. 5/5 UMass-Lowell.
“It was a good game, [but] it wasn’t exactly the way we want to be playing,” Horton said. “We know we can play better."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 131st edition of The Game had it all. From championship implications to a late comeback to dramatic, pressure-packed moments, the 31,062 fans that crammed into Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon were treated to a historic affair.
As Harvard fans stormed the field after the final whistle blew, Crimson players celebrated knowing they had secured an undefeated season, sole possession of the Ivy League title, and a 31-24 victory in one of the most thrilling Games in recent memory. And its most enduring image came with under a minute to go.
Let me briefly set the stage. Harvard (10-0, 7-0 Ivy) was sitting pretty at the beginning of the fourth quarter, leading its archrival, 24-7. But Yale (8-2, 5-2) rattled off 17 straight points to tie the game and silence a previously boisterous Harvard crowd.
The Crimson offense took over possession and utilized runs from junior Paul Stanton and short completions from senior quarterback Conner Hempel to march to the Yale 35 with exactly a minute left.
That’s when junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer stepped up.
On first-and-10, Hempel dropped back to pass. Lined up to the right, Fischer burst off the line and ran a slant-and-go route. According to Hempel, the Crimson offense had relied on slants over the middle all game. When Fischer broke vertical on the double move, Bulldogs defensive back Dale Harris bit.
Hempel lofted a high throw down the right sideline. While the quarterback had underthrown deep receivers on multiple occasions earlier in the game, this pass was right on the money. Fischer reeled it in despite a diving effort from Harris and leapt into the promised land for the 35-yard score.
Fischer ran around the end zone until his teammates caught him to join the celebration. Hempel leapt into the arms of senior lineman Anthony Fabiano. The Crimson bench nearly exploded off the sideline. While Harvard fans rejoiced, Yale supporters stood utterly shocked.
In just five seconds, Harvard had taken a 31-24 lead it would not relinquish—and had provided fans with a highlight to be watched for years to come.
“It was a great play,” Fischer said. “There was no doubt in our minds that we were going to go out and execute.”
DON’T CALL IT A COMEBACK
Although the Crimson found itself trailing at halftime, 7-3, the home team finally began to light up the scoreboard in the third quarter. In 15 minutes, Harvard scored three touchdowns to finally create separation from the Bulldogs.
Faced with a 24-7 deficit to begin the fourth quarter, Yale coach Tony Reno gathered his entire team. With his players on a knee and Reno in the center, the coach attempted to inject some energy in a Yale squad that been held scoreless for two straight quarters.
“Team 142 is a very resilient group,” Reno said. “We don’t quit. This team doesn’t quit, and this team never will quit. I brought them all together and reminded them of who they are.”
Entering Saturday’s game, Yale’s offense ranked first in the Ivy League with an average of 43 points scored per contest. While the FCS-best Harvard defense had clamped down on its archrival thus far, the Bulldog attack finally came to life with three consecutive touchdown drives.
Yale needed less than three minutes to march 79 yards down the field as the fourth quarter began. After a diving, 38-yard reception by Mike Siragusa brought Yale to the one-yard line, it took senior running back Tyler Varga just a single play to bust into the end zone.
Down just ten points now, the momentum continued to drift in the direction of the blue-and-white when the Crimson racked up 25 yards of penalties on the ensuing offensive possession. After a 14-yard punt resulted in great field position for Yale, a Roberts pass found Varga for the senior’s third touchdown of the afternoon.
Clinging to a three-point lead with eight minutes to go, the pressure now fell on Harvard to grind down the clock. But on the second play of the Crimson drive, Stanton bobbled a Hempel handoff for his second lost fumble of the game. A few minutes later, the Bulldogs tied the game with a 33-yard field goal.
After Fischer’s dramatic touchdown, Yale had one last chance to mount another potential game-tying drive. But an errant Roberts pass instead landed in the outstretched arms of junior safety Scott Peters. In the end, the Crimson defense had the last word.
A GAME FOR THE AGES
The Harvard offense may have provided the lasting images for Saturday’s national audience, but the defense that carried the team all year long showed up as well.
Yale’s 24 points scored marked the team’s lowest total of the entire season. The Crimson defense bent throughout the game, but it never broke.
Senior linebacker Connor Sheehan’s 90-yard interception return marked his third pick-six of the season, along with an all-time program record. Harvard career sacks leader Zack Hodges added another two to his impressive ledger.
“We’re the best defense in the country, and we’ll graduate being the best defense in the country,” Hodges said.
The victory capped a historic season for Harvard football. In addition to an outright Ivy League title, the Crimson achieved its third undefeated season in the past century along with eight consecutive victories over Yale. For Harvard, there couldn’t have been a better way to go out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a pendulum swings through the air, a drag force will inevitably cause its swings to get smaller and smaller until it stops. That’s reality, and that’s life.
The swings of the momentum pendulum that was the 131st playing of The Game were nothing like reality. They began small, and then grew bigger, until the final swing catapulted this matchup between Harvard (10-0, 7-0 Ivy) and Yale (8-2, 5-2) to perhaps one of the biggest in history.
First, a small swing went in Harvard’s direction. Senior quarterback Conner Hempel, who has been intermittently playing this season due to a bevy of different injuries, was finally back. An athletic, dual-threat play-caller, Hempel’s presence was huge both for the Crimson’s offensive production and for his leadership on the field.
However, Hempel’s return also led to the next swing away—Hempel had practiced a total of a day and a half since he injured his shoulder against Dartmouth three weeks ago, and coupled with the near-freezing temperature, looked rusty out of the gates. Miscommunication with his receivers turned into a turnover on downs.
Then there was a slightly larger swing back. The defense held strong for a three-and-out, and senior defensive back Ryan Jones blocked his second punt of the season. The Crimson had possession inside the 10-yard line, and with a nearly 60 percent red zone touchdown conversion rate, looked poised to tack seven on the board.
But the pendulum swung towards Yale once again, when Harvard’s offense—which racked up just 26 total yards in the first quarter—lost a yard on that possession and had to settle for a field goal. And it didn’t stop there, as Bulldogs running back Tyler Varga made short work of the nation’s second-ranked FCS rushing defense to finish Yale’s drive in the end zone. Harvard trailed heading into halftime for just the second time all season.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s words at halftime gave the pendulum a huge push. The third quarter was all Crimson, as Hempel and company came to life—the senior found junior wideout Andrew Fischer four times for 96 yards in the third quarter alone—to score 14 straight points. The defense added another score when senior linebacker Connor Sheehan recorded his third pick-six of the season.
It seemed like the Crimson had put this one away, up 17 with just 15 minutes of play to go. But Mother Pendulum had one more swing in Yale’s direction, and this one was a doozy.
The Bulldogs quickly marched down the field to begin the fourth quarter to cut the lead to 10, and then an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty coupled with a shanked punt gave Yale the ball in Harvard territory.
The next Crimson drive—off a botched handoff, which led to a fumble—gave the Bulldogs the exact same field position. Both drives began at the Harvard 46, and both drives ended in the Harvard end zone. One Yale score later—this one a field goal—and the pendulum had swung all the way back. All of a sudden, with four minutes to go, a sure win had become a tied game.
A natural pendulum would be all swung out. But this pendulum had a little extra left in it for Harvard, and its final swing saw Hempel find Fischer streaking down the sideline for a 35-yard touchdown with less than a minute left. Any hopes of an Eli miracle comeback were dashed when the swing continued as linebacker Scott Peters intercepted Yale quarterback Morgan Roberts. 31-24, Harvard.
It might not be unsurprising that it would take some otherworldly force to swing the Harvard football pendulum against the drag force that was the mountain of adversity this season. From a secondary that was the definition of inexperienced to a slew of injuries that threatened the Crimson offense at every skill position, this force seemed to keep Harvard’s streak alive in the most unlikely of times.
But perhaps the force isn’t so otherworldly. Perhaps it is grounded in the “sheer willpower” that Murphy has consistently talked about in press conferences this year—the sheer willpower that has caused the young secondary, led by captain Norman Hayes, to lead the league in pass defense, and the sheer willpower that has enabled backups like Scott Hosch to step up when Hempel and others have been sidelined for weeks on end with injury.
That sheer willpower, instilled by Murphy and his coaching staff, gave the Crimson its eighth consecutive victory over Yale on Saturday, gave Murphy’s squad the outright Ancient Eight crown, and resulted in just the third time in 100 years that Harvard has gone undefeated.
And even though Hempel, Hayes, and others will graduate, that sheer willpower and resiliency will likely remain in the concrete walls of Harvard Stadium, passed on through the legacy of the 10,000 men of Harvard, to give the new generation of Harvard football the same force that Murphy’s squad found every week this fall to counteract the pendulum of reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 61st minute of the game, sophomore forward Midge Purce sped downfield past a handful of UCLA defenders and passed the ball off to sophomore forward Joan Fleischman in the box. Fleischman chipped the incoming pass for the Harvard women’s soccer team’s first and only shot on goal in the game.
But Bruins’ senior goalkeeper Katelyn Rowland handled the try easily and quickly sent a long pass downfield to set up a counterattack. Rowland’s pass found junior forward Taylor Smith, who broke away from the Crimson defense down the right side of the field. Angling in from the corner, Smith hit a chip shot that found the side netting of the far post to give UCLA a 5-0 lead.
This 90-second exchange reflected the 90 minutes of play, with the defending national champion Bruins (20-0-2, 10-0-1 Pac-12) dominating Harvard (11-5-2, 5-1-1 Ivy) in the second round of the NCAA tournament, 7-0, on Friday night at Drake Stadium.
“UCLA had everything,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “They had the speed, they had the tactics, they had the [technique]. There were no weaknesses.”
The Bruins wasted no time getting on the board.
Just over a minute into the game, the Crimson committed a foul in the box to grant UCLA a penalty kick. Bruins senior midfielder Sarah Killion fired a low strike to the right post to put UCLA up 1-0.
In the second half, Harvard sophomore goalkeeper Lizzie Durack faced a second penalty shot. Although she guessed incorrectly with a dive to the left in the first half, she stuck with the move in the second. This time it paid off, as she dug out a save against the Bruins top goal-scorer, senior midfielder Sam Mewis.
This highlighted Durack's collection of seven saves in her 57 and a half minutes between the posts.
“I was particularly proud of [Durack],” Leone said. “It’s very difficult when you are the last line of defense to keep your head up and get the ball out of the net and be ready to go again.  She knew it was going to be an onslaught against her, and she was obviously ready and excited for the challenge.”
UCLA took 24 shots in the game, with 14 of those coming in the first half.
Five minutes after Killion netted the penalty, she tallied a second goal on a header off a corner.
The Bruins, who have conceded only four goals all season and none in the nine games since Oct. 9, ruined Harvard’s game plan with its early scores.
“We knew that we weren’t going to try to go at them and score right away since their defense is obviously really strong,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “So our game plan was to stop them from scoring early. When they scored, it kind of killed our morale, just because it killed our game plan and definitely our confidence a little bit too.”
Durack’s performance in goal was not enough to overcome UCLA’s relentless attack.
In the 26th minute, Bruins senior forward Rosie White fired off a shot from the top of the 18-yard box, but Durack managed to make the save. Within 15 seconds, UCLA made a quick throw-in and cross that senior forward Kylie McCarthy directed to the left post beyond Durack’s reach to add to the Bruins lead.
White added a goal in the closing minutes of the first half to give UCLA a 4-0 advantage.
But the Crimson came out fighting early in the second half. Durack came up with three saves in the first 13 minutes of the half, and Harvard started to press forward on offense.
“I’ve been in those games a few times, and I’ve never seen a team do what we did in the second half,” Leone said. “Knowing the season’s ending and just how hard we fought to the very, very last drop. That was really exciting to see even though [UCLA] was just so much better.”
The Crimson had its best chance of the game when Purce and Fleischman combined for the team’s only shot on goal. But the Bruins capitalized on the counter attack to score the first goal of the half and take a 5-0 lead.
UCLA struck two more times in the 74th and 79th minutes of the game to round out the scoring at 7-0.
“We came away from the weekend just being happy that as a program we’ve worked our way to a place where we have the opportunity to play teams like [UCLA],” Margolius said.
