After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mountain climbers are notoriously individualistic and determined folk, and Phillip Stölzl’s “North Face,” which opens this Friday at the Kendall Square Cinema, provides a rare glimpse into their rugged characters. What drives them to do what they do? Or, as the film asks in its opening sequence, “Why would anyone want to climb that?” And yet the irresistible impulse of the mountaineer is to overcome the mountain and to discipline those tempting inner voices that seductively implore the climber to stay below. For anyone missing the thrill of mountain climbing, “North Face” will take you to the heart of the mountains vicariously. For its singular ability to capture the vertiginous adrenaline rush of a dangerous climb, “North Face” is to be commended. Yet the audience for “North Face” ought not to be composed solely of fans of mountaineering, for it is far more than just a simple story about climbing. In this film, the mountain represents everything that is impossible and everything that man fears, and the movie’s central question—focusing on whether the heroes can conquer that fear— is therefore all the more captivating.
The premise is simple: the year is 1936, shortly before the Berlin Winter Olympics. In the spirit of Nazi nationalism, there is a general desire in Germany to prove absolute Germanic superiority in all things, including mountain climbing. In the Alps there remains the stubbornly unconquered Eiger Nordvand (or North Face), the “last problem of the Alps.” The Eiger’s other nicknames include Ogre, or more pertinently, the Death Wall. Inexorably drawn to face their greatest challenge yet. The film’s intrepid heroes are the sprightly, fearless Andi Hinterstoisser (Florian Lukas), and his climbing companion, the brooding Toni Kurz (Benno Furrmann). For this duo, to conquer the Eiger’s North Face is to conquer the world. They are cheered on by Luise (Johanna Wokalek), an amateur photographer and their childhood friend, as well as her employer, the deliciously callous Berliner Zeitung reporter Arau (Ulrich Tukur).
The rapport between Lukas and Furrmann is unwaveringly sincere, thus cementing the believability of their friendship. In fact, the acting in the film is uniformly superb, with a particularly outstanding performance from Wokalek, who conveys a seemingly paradoxical blend of timidity and strength.
The complexity of the acting in the film contrasts intriguingly with the story, which is sketched in bold, simple lines. The film speaks to the viewer on a visceral level. Its quiet moments are sublime, packed with unspoken emotion as Andi dances across vertical rock walls, Toni looks out at the dark mountains at night with an expression as inscrutable as the mountains themselves, and the piton hammers into the rock face with a defiant chink.
These moments seem almost mythical, as they momentarily reduce the world to the eternal struggle of man versus nature. It is impossible to remain uninvolved in this semi-mythic world, even though Toni and Andi seem almost painfully naïve in contrast with Arau, who watches their efforts with a curiously self-interested detachment.
The ultimate irony of Andi and Toni’s attempts to escape the banality of their day-to-day lives through the climb, is that their journey is intrinsically tied into the spirit of the times. “I’m doing this for myself” says Toni, near the beginning of the film – he later amends that statement. As the story progresses, Stölzl shows the viewer how the political agenda of 1936 Germany exploited the myth of “heroic alpinism” by transforming it into a political catchphrase. In the eyes of the Reich, mountains, as much as people and countries, are there to be conquered. The sincerity of Andi and Toni’s passion for mountain climbing becomes something to be observed, dissected and sold as propaganda by the reporter Arau, from his comfortable vantage point in a luxury hotel that overlooks the Eiger’s deadly northern face. And Arau, of course, is not alone. He is accompanied by the throngs of other visitors at the hotel who watch the ascent of the Eiger through binoculars with great excitement- the excitement, as one guest puts it, of a gladiatorial match.
Who ultimately wins in “North Face”—the climbers or the observers—is hard to say. The most obvious victor in this movie is Phillip Stölzl, who created an intensely emotional and riveting film. The simple fact that a movie focusing on such a niche interest could appeal to a general audience is a testament to the universality of its message.

What was he thinking? This seems to be the question that eluded Pierre Morel, director of “From Paris With Love.” With his third feature in ten years, Morel seems intent on creating an aura of mystery for himself. He refuses to answer questions in interviews about his motivations, and when the interviews are conducted in his native French, he does not allow his words to be subtitled for non-French speakers. Though I am loathe to admit it, Morel’s antics intrigue me. As I watched “From Paris With Love,” the sprawling, undisciplined nature of the film’s themes made me increasingly interested in how Morel would explain his genre-bending style.
“From Paris With Love” is an action film about a personal aide to an U.S. Ambassador in France. However, what James Reece, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, really wants to do is to work for the C.I.A. He finally gets his chance when he is asked to be the driver of the semi-autonomous secret agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta). James has built his career by playing it by the book, and he’s thrown for a loop by the gun-happy, axiom-spitting Charlie. James questions the wisdom behind Charlie’s actions, only to find that Charlie knows what he’s doing. In his role as apprentice-cum-sidekick, James gradually learns more about what his mission entails, as well as his own inner nature.
Between its plot and the actors’ delivery (“Nail this job and consider yourself a part of the club,” says James’ unseen C.I.A. correspondent, while Charlie Wax tells the gangs he shoots up to “Wax on, wax off”), “From Paris With Love” so embraces cliché that it almost becomes tongue-in-cheek. Indeed, a lot of the movie finds humor in appropriating the hokey reality of action movies such as “Rush Hour.” There are one-liners making fun of the American perception of the French—at one point, Travolta even paraphrases his character from “Pulp Fiction,” saying dramatically, “Everyone has got their vice. And my vice is: a Royale with cheese.”
The movie is a mix of action, comedy, policier, and of course, romance. Many movies try to cross genre boundaries to reach a larger audience, and Morel is no exception. But his approach is confused, and given the seriousness of one thematic element it tries to weave in—that of terrorism and suicide bombings—that confusion proves detrimental to the film as a whole.
As James discovers, the drug-busting mission they set out on is really a mission to trace the money back to a circle of Pakistani terrorists. These Pakistanis are the center of a labyrinth of cocaine and prostitution, and hang around with explosive vests on their tables. Furthermore, their plot is to infiltrate the U.S. Embassy with explosives hidden beneath their burqas.
Given the racial profiling going on in America against Arabs, and more relevantly, the current controversy regarding burqas in France, this plot development is a sensitive one that deserves to be handled with care, and it’s here that the mixture of comedy and action becomes a problem. The comedy seems to sound at the wrong points; Charlie’s unerring deductions seem a testament to defamatory racial stereotypes. The only attempt to bring attention to the fact that the Pakistanis in the film should not be judged as a group happens during a dinner party. Charlie pulls a gun on the friend of James’ girlfriend when she answers the phone, and the girlfriend screams that just because her friend is Pakistani doesn’t mean that she’s a terrorist. Unfortunately, this temperance is undermined, because in this case she is.
The ease of ethnic categorization in this movie provides undertones. But then again, maybe Morel wasn’t thinking of that. Heavy issues aside, “From Paris With Love” is a formulaic but quirky film, with funny bits and lots of explosions. Just be happy Charlie isn’t working in an airport.

Skiers beware! After seeing “Frozen” your next vacation will likely be in the warmest location possible. Unlike most horror film directors, writer and director Adam Green requires no elaborate torture devices, no grotesque supernatural entities, and no masked psychopathic killers to terrify his audience. Instead, Green expertly captures the realism of dying at the hands of Mother Nature to craft his latest success.
The film centers on a couple, Parker and Dan, and Dan’s long-time best friend Joe, as the three go skiing for a weekend. They try to squeeze in one last run at the end of the day, but a mix up leaves them stranded on a ski lift.  The trio soon realize they are trapped, as no one will return to the mountain for days. They are too high to safely jump and it’s too dangerous for them to climb across the lift cable, leaving them in a seemingly hopeless predicament.
The plot is not particularly original. The film is mostly a transposition of 2004’s “Open Water.” Instead of being stranded in the middle of the ocean with a group of sharks, the protagonists of “Frozen” battle freezing temperatures, lack of food or water, and a pack of hungry wolves below.
While the plot may not be particularly inventive, the brilliance of the film is that, compared to modern horror film standards, freezing temperatures and a pack of wolves do not sound particularly frightening. However, Green portrays the group’s desperation in such a hauntingly realistic manner that he manages to make frostbitten faces and frozen limbs be just as disturbing as the most expensively elaborate special effect.
Because it focuses on the single stationary chair lift for three quarters of its running time, the film easily could have given become tiresome to endure. However, though Green lacks a measure of technical freedom due to the airborne nature of the lift, he still manages to capture the protagonists’ plight from a multitude of angles, which makes the movie constantly engaging on a visual level. Green’s imaginative directing is one of the greatest strengths of the film and is the main reason why it works.
By contrast, Green’s writing is considerably weaker. The script is not particularly deep and relies too much on exaggerated emotional outbursts. This is a bit unexpected as Green’s most popular film to date, 2006’s “Hatchet,” was primarily buoyed by its inventive screenplay, which played popular horror conventions for laughs.
However, while the movie may be a bit too heavy-handed at times, the emotional core of the film is both unexpected and effective. Surprisingly, the central focus is not on Parker and Dan’s relationship, but instead on the evolution of Parker and Joe’s friendship. Joe, disgruntled that Parker monopolized Dan’s time since they started dating, resents her presence. While stuck in the chair lift, the two are forced to grow and support each other. The two develop genuine rapport with one another, and it is surprisingly touching to see how they are able to bond through adversity.
The friendship of the two, however, is somewhat blemished by the acting of Emma Bell, who plays Parker. The performances of her two male counterparts, played by Kevin Zegers and Shawn Ashmore, are perfectly serviceable. However, Bell’s unceasing whining is downright annoying at times and her performance is unconvincing.
Part of the problem is that her character is written to be helpless—she often panics and lacks the common sense one should have in a dire situation. Her biggest lapse in judgment comes when she falls asleep with her bare hand gripping a pole. The audience must watch as she peels her frostbitten hand off in sheer agony.  Moments like these provide great thrills, yet one wonders how anyone could be so foolish when the stakes are so high.
For thrill-seeking horror fans, the movie may not be perfect, but it is a blast, providing a breath of fresh air in an often formulaic genre. The film leaves a strong lasting impression, and it will likely creep unexpectedly into your mind, especially when hitting the slopes for that last run of the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you ever felt comfortable going skinny-dipping, it was likely before you saw Stephen Spielberg’s 1975 thriller “Jaws.” Similarly, if you plan on seeing director Adam Green’s newest horror film “Frozen,” you may think twice about hitting the slopes. As Green says, if you are going to see “Frozen,” be ready for a “psychological mind-fuck of a movie.” But as Green explains, he also hopes to jump-start a revitalization of the independent horror film, a genre he claims has faded in the last decade.
“Frozen” is set in a small ski resort in the Northeast where a trio of friends set-off for a fun weekend during the heart of winter. All is well until they become stuck on a chair lift, 50 feet in the air, with no one expected to return to the mountain for days.
“I grew up skiing in the New England area and not being able to afford to go to the real mountains up North,” says Green. “Not exactly real mountain skiing. And in the time periods when they were only open Friday to Sunday, and you were on that last run, and you hear the lift stop, you always had that scary thought that you were stuck.”
This is the fourth feature film directed by Adam Green. His past works include the cult-hit slasher “Hatchet” and the more upbeat comedy “Coffee & Donuts.” “Frozen,” also written by Green, represents a turn toward a more serious brand of horror and aims to set a more grim and realistic tone.
“It’s all shot practically,” explains Green. “There is no sound stage, no green screen, no CGI. The actors are all actually in the air. The weather is real. All the things that threaten them are real.”
The film was shot in the town of Snow Basin, Utah, located 10,000 feet above sea level, during the middle of the coldest time of year.
“The coldest I remember Utah was when we’d have to ride the lift all the way up after filming,” says Green. “[In] minus 30 degree wind chill. Absolute agony for the whole 45 minute ride.”
The elevated setting presented other filming challenges. “We used a 50 foot techno crane with a ten foot platform,” says Green. “When the chair was moving, and the actors were speaking, that was hard. The ski mountain wouldn’t allow us to hang a camera on the chair, so we built this cherry picker bucket that we hung right in front of their chair. We couldn’t find anyone to get up in the bucket to shoot, so we shot it ourselves. That was one of the hardest parts. I’m afraid of heights.”
The heights and the weather were not the only agonizing parts of production. “All the wolves are real,” says Green. “Critics assume that they must be CGI. We had 6 weeks of training with a pack of wolves with the wolf man. This was the same wolf man who trained the wolves in ‘Dances with Wolves’ and ‘The Chronicles of Narnia.’ They are wild animals. They are unpredictable. At any moment, they could snap.”
“Frozen” made its premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival in late January, garnering significant attention.  “We had the best experience anyone could hope for at Sundance,” says Green. “All five shows were sold out within 48 hours of going on sale. We had a waitlist line.
Someone fainted in the lobby during the first show, two people threw up in the second, and we had people running out during the other three. They were innocent bystanders. When it hits them, they just can’t take it. Every time we lost someone, I would kind of cheer inside.”
Now, upon wider release, “Frozen” has received some polarizing critical comments from the Hollywood press.  “When people see the trailer,” Green explains, “they automatically become Spiderman, stating all the ways they could escape. Critics make their decisions long before they see the movie. And when they see it and see the fact that all their ideas don’t work, then they get defensive.”
When asked about his expectations for the film’s release, Green turned to address his expectations for the industry as a whole.
“We’re definitely realistic,” says Green. “It’s a tough time to be making movies. Now, you only get 72 hours instead of a six week release. It’s sad and it’s tough. And it’s just going to get worse.”
“Fans won’t pay to see new ideas,” Green continues. “They go to see the remakes of whatever the fuck and bitch about it not being as good while not going to see the original movies.”
This, Green goes on to say, is a barrier that the industry must break through. “Most films like ours go straight to DVD,” says Green.
“It’s sad that this is the state that horror is in. When it’s not a remake, you’re counted out. I hope we can change that. And as we move forward, maybe we can change it.”

Many fans of the popular “Twilight” saga and its film franchise would like to maintain the illusion that the Cullens’ sparkling diamond-like skin is merely an unfortunate sun-induced vampire affliction, or that Taylor Lautner’s transformation into a werewolf in the film version of “New Moon” is a manifestation of a Quilete tribe member’s coming-of-age in a troubled, vampire-ridden world.
However, the mystical, supernatural feats depicted in the grossly popular “Twilight” movies, based on Stephanie Meyer’s novels, can be attributed to one equation that is applied each time a digital effect is added to a film:
O = A x M + B x (1 - M)
Or in other words, the over-composite image—the final cohesive shot one sees—is equal to a combination of two or more constituent images—digital and film stills—layered together.
On Wednesday, Eric Pascarelli, visual effects supervisor of Prime Focus VFX, and Matt Jacobs, visual effects supervisor of Tippet Studio, teamed up at the Museum of Science to deliver “Conjuring New Moon,” an explanation of the CGI effects responsible for Edward’s shimmering skin, Bella’s lovesick hallucinations, and the Quilete tribe’s werewolf transformations in the popular second film installment.
Pascarelli first explained the techno-genius behind “The Diamond Guy Effect,” the studio’s name for the glitter effect applied to Edward when he steps into sunlight. Pascarelli showed a video clip of Edward (Robert Pattinson), wracked with teenage angst, unbuttoned shirt framing his subtly painted abs. Over the sounds of screaming, excited fans mooning over Edward at the shooting, Pascarelli addressed the audience—a motley crew of middle-aged women and nerdy computer science high school students: “We based the glittering of his skin off of Thrassos marble,” Pascarelli said, as he replayed the clip of Edward’s shimmering, Greek-god like abs over, and over, and over again.
A complicated scheme of virtual manipulations creates the glittery CGI effect that simulates sunlight reflecting off Edward’s body. In Pascarelli’s video, Edward has black “tracking” dots applied all over his exposed skin, which the visual effects team later translated into a virtual mesh model of his body. The crew then used the mesh model to make a virtual wax model with a full-body cyber scan of Robert Pattinson as a guide. With a software program, they applied virtual miniature mirrors over the model, and introduced virtual suns—sources of light—into the frame. They recorded the reflections produced from the mirrors and super-imposed these reflections onto the real-time film of Edward, creating an over-composite image that matched the shape of his body.
“When we darkened his skin it looked like a skin disorder... this is more subtle,” Pascarelli said.
The CGI sleight-of-hand is also responsible for Bella’s visions of Edward—the apparitions emerge when Bella purposefully endangers her life, such as when she gets on the back of a biker-thug’s Harley, or when she jumps off a cliff. When Bella rides her own motorcycle, she hallucinates that Edward is following her. This scene is testimony to Stewart’s acting abilities: the motorcycle she was riding was nailed to a moving trailer, and when asked to “arbitrarily turn her head,” she panted longingly as she whipped her hair around. The visual effects crew then shot Edward on a green screen and projected his image onto a cloud of computer particles in the shape of a blurred candle flame so that he would seem more transparent. This effect also facilitated the illusion of Edward’s image blowing away into the wind, which was created with a nature-simulator that dispersed these “blurred candle” particles with a virtual breeze.
Matt Jacobs then described the process of creating horse-sized Quilete wolves: a combination of Timber wolves, Maned wolves, and elements of traditional werewolf lore. He wanted to stay true to “the special mythology of a wolf, [where] the wolf and the man spirits were combined, to protect his native lands, in this case from vampires.” The visual effects crew spent a few days observing Timber wolves at the Wolf Mountain Sanctuary in California to better understand their expressions, fur texture, gait, and other wolfy habits.
Modelers created a base mesh, or virtual model of the wolf, and puppeteers imbued the wolves’ nostrils, jaws, teeth, and ears with discreet, virtually-controlled commands so that animators could simulate wolf emotions (fear, submission, aggression, or the fervent yearning of unrequited love). The Tippett Studio invented a “proprietary fur tool” to generate the 4 million hairs on each wolf, and programmed each hair to randomly clump, rotate, vary in color, and simulate the effects of wind and movement.
The lecture exposed the two most beloved elements of the “Twilight Saga”: detailed full-body scans of Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, and manifestations of Stephanie Meyer’s quixotic supernatural mysticism. A swoon-worthy cast and a genius visual effects crew are the reasons why “New Moon,” with a budget of only $50 million and less-than stellar critical reviews, has already grossed $704 million worldwide.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 10, 2010
An earlier version of the Feb. 9 arts article "'New Moon' Panel Unveils CGI Tricks" incorrectly stated the equation that was applied each time a digital effect had been added to the film "New Moon." The equation is O = A x M + B x (1 - M), not O = A x M + B x (1 x M).

“Stairs to the Roof” is a play that many theater-goers may never have heard of by a playwright they probably know quite well. One of Tennessee Williams’ earliest works and his first written deliberately for a mass audience, “Stairs” has never had the popular appeal of Williams’ later plays. Seemingly aware of this fact, visiting director Michael M. Donahue ’05 turns the Agassiz theater inside-out with an exciting and unconventional production that breathes vibrant life into a work that wouldn’t ordinarily jump off the page.
“Stairs” is the story of Benjamin Murphy, a cog in the machine at a shirt manufacturing company, whose only escape from his drab world is a secret set of stairs that leads him to the roof of the building in which he works. Benjamin is portrayed by portrayed by Scott E. Lyman, a graduate student at the American Repertory Theater/ Moscow Art Theater School Institute for Advanced Theater Training at Harvard University (A.R.T./MXAT). Stuck in a life he has no passion for, Benjamin and his co-worker (A.R.T./MXAT student Lindsay Strachan), referred to simply as Girl, embark on a whimsical adventure to explore everything their lives had previously denied them.
Donahue flips the audience’s perspective by seating them on the stage, while the play’s action takes place on a platform in the middle of the traditional seating area. However, the actors are not solely confined to this makeshift stage; two ladders give them access to the balcony of the theater, and they roam freely throughout the entire space.
The staging consistently takes full advantage of the extra square footage, as the director scatters actors among levels and between seats to keep things interesting when Williams’ dialogue gets preachy or repetitive. These arrangements are clever, surprising, and never distracting.
In one scene, Benjamin and Girl joke back and forth while hanging from the two ladders, adding a little bit of tension to a scene that otherwise could have felt stale. The ladders, in particular, not only hold symbolic value in the context of the themes of the play, but also do a good job of unifying the theatrical playground.
The space constantly hums with the energy of a living, breathing workspace; at various points, the background features a tailor tending to dressed mannequins, messengers running back and forth, and secretaries laboring silently on their invisible type-writers.
Details like working light bulbs on the tops of mannequins and an old-fashioned lamppost extending from one corner add character to the expansive stage. In one scene, Benjamin and Girl come across a carnival and actors situated above the stage pour down hundreds of brightly-colored balls while a previously unnoticed ring of red and orange Christmas lights comes alive along the balcony.
Unfortunately, the performance of the cast is less consistent. The two leads are backed by an exceptionally versatile ensemble of actors and actresses who snap effortlessly from one age or accent to another, simultaneously taking care of all the set changes as well. A.R.T./MXAT student Jason M. Beaubein in particular is a scene-stealer both as a shark-like office executive and a crazed French ringmaster.
Lyman and Strachan’s  performances are less compelling. Benjamin has a youthful excitement from the outset that lacks any of the weariness that his character claims to experience after the eight years he’s spent at a dead-end job. There’s simply a disconnect between his delivery and the problems Benjamin professes to have.
When Lyman’s enthusiasm builds during Benjamin’s adventures, the performance borders on the campy; he prances around stage wearing bright red boots, a muscle shirt, and a veil tied around his waist like a skirt­—elements that drift both in action and appearance from the aesthetic of the 1930s.
Although her performance as Girl improves as the play progresses, Strachan struggles initially to capture the love-struck nervousness of her character. During her first encounter with her boss, she misses a comedic opportunity and comes off more awkward than relatable. She seems much more comfortable as the strong, confident character that Girl becomes later. However, because she never quite convinces early on, this transformation is less than satisfying.
Despite the weaknesses of the two leads, “Stairs to the Roof” comes into it’s own in the last twenty minutes. The expertly choreographed ensemble uses elements of pantomime, slow motion, and Vaudevillian antics to highlight the strengths of Williams’ story. Although the ending of the play is shamelessly deus ex machina, it is done in a way that is genuinely surprising even in the context of an already unconventional production.
This vibrant re-envisioning of “Stairs” takes a lot of risks, yet nearly all of them pay off. The freshness and originality that is consistently present in the production is able to make an old and somewhat obscure play feel relevant and new again.

Benjamin Britten’s 1947 comic opera “Albert Herring” revels in the notion of being bad on purpose. The Dunster House Opera’s current production, which runs through Feb. 13, uses its formidable discipline to create a tight, wry vision of Britten’s fable of mischief.
The haughty, moralizing elders of a small English town, unable to find a female chaste enough to crown queen on May Day, turn to the one youth they can be sure is a virgin: the spineless, blandly upright Albert Herring (Zander J. MacQuitty ’10). Understandably embarrassed at having his sex life (or lack thereof) on display, Albert is forced to undergo the further humiliations of wearing a funny hat and being pointed at. He’s miserable until he drinks a glass of spiked lemonade, which not only gets him through the day but also propels him into a night of deliberate, serial offstage sinning. To the impotent consternation of the townsfolk, Albert returns in the morning with a backbone and a smirk.
Britten’s astringent score calls for an equally dry wit, and Dunster House Opera’s laconic production of “Herring” appropriately aims more for poised subtlety than madcap laughter. Concise acting makes the plot clear at all times, even when the clarity comes at the expense of a joke (though there are plenty). Humor emerges from the libretto rather than being scaffolded upon it.
The conservative approach extends to the performance space in creative ways. Dunster Dining Hall provides an unforgiving stage: sound gets trapped in pockets, the ceiling height forces an odd lighting setup, and the dark wood paneling renders everything strangely somber. But the company manages to employ the staid dignity of the room to reinforce the moral severity of the town elders. At one point, they even co-opt one of the chandeliers—by far the most physically obtrusive element of the space—as a prop.
The problem of the flow of sound is more difficult to solve. Without a pit as such, the orchestra must play on the same level as the audience, and tends to trap the singing behind it, occasionally making it difficult to catch words or phrases. However, music director Nico A. Olarte-Hayes ’11 leads the chamber orchestra with admirable restraint, and even the best of conductors and ensembles would have a hard time playing more surreptitiously.
Olarte-Hayes also manages to capture Britten’s pastoral disquiet especially well, given the disadvantage of a reduced dynamic palette. In terms of both music and plot, the defining idiosyncrasy and greatest challenge of Britten’s work is the sense of a rural world that has just disappeared from real life—grimy and intolerant, yet somehow possessed of some endearing ignorance that we no longer have. The orchestra warmly articulates the meandering melodic lines, but shades them with a well-measured anxiety that elegantly propels the emotional dynamic of the opera.
The space can make the singers sound quieter than they actually are. Given these constraints, sometimes mezzo-fortes in place of pianos might have been more helpful for both the audience and the cast, as the more nuanced dynamic gestures often disappear beneath the accompaniment. Lucid narrative drive compensates for the occasional gaps in audibility, though, and a coherent collective vision of the direction of each scene helps anchor the plot to a regular pace (“Herring,” with apologies to Britten, does tend to saunter rather than walk). Matthew B. Bird ’10, as the village vicar, has the clearest sense of his surroundings and produces a correspondingly full sound that drew the most out of an otherwise secondary role. Bridget Haile ’11 performs the role of the small-town bigwig Lady Billows with glowing irony and cutting diction—crucial for an English-language opera performed without the benefit of surtitles.
The cleverest and most enjoyable aspect of the company’s performance, though, is the carefully maintained attention to the many styles, genres, and works that Britten gleefully ventriloquizes. Flirtation between Sid (James B. Danner ’12) and Nancy (Katie K. Schick ’10) swings into a harsh sort of jazz, sung with appropriate swagger and well-coordinated stage direction that emphasizes the awkwardness of the moment for Albert. Imitation folk songs are sung in a child’s squeal. Mock-Italian quintet singing is delivered with appropriate exuberance. Herring hiccups repeatedly to the “Tristan und Isolde” chord before he goes out for his night on the town—Britten’s in-joke to regular operagoers, and one entirely appropriate for an opera that depicts desire as transgressive as Wagner’s, but with infinitely more levity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2003, New Directions, a publishing company historically known for its stake in experimental literature, printed the first English translation of the late Roberto Bolanõ’s work—the slim volume “By Night in Chile”—during a time when contemporary Latin American authors were struggling to gain a foothold in the American market. Circulating among critics well-versed in the literary tradition of Isabel Allende and Gabriel García Márquez, the translation introduced readers to a then-unknown Latin America, one neither swathed in magic realism nor saturated with family saga, but instead, mired—violently, bitterly, and evocatively—in political repression. The novella would mark the bloody delivery of visceral realism into the American consciousness, which soon became infatuated with the macabre elements that rage so relentlessly through Bolanõ’s work and that of his contemporary and cohort, Salvadoran Horacio Castellanos Moya. This fascination, wrote Moya in a critical piece he penned for Argentine newspaper “La Nacion,” has evolved dangerously throughout the years: the portrayal of Bolanõ as a non-conformist, subversive heroin addict serves only to still a masturbatory urge to redefine Latin American literature and culture in an American English vernacular.
Moya’s own work, of which “Senselessness,” “The She-Devil in the Mirror,” and most recently, “Dance with Snakes” have been translated from Spanish, is evidence of the author’s acute comprehension of society’s penchant for forcing what is foreign into a controllable compartment. “Dance with Snakes,” originally published in 1996 and now translated by Lee Paula Springer, is a four-part frenzy, a detailed depiction of the chaotic hell one man and four murderous snakes engender. Superficially a fantastical page-turner, the novel is at its core an uncompromising interrogation of authority, a gruesome satire whose pivot turns on exposing the consequences that result from a manipulated identity.
Eduardo Sosa, the antihero of “Dance with Snakes,” is an unemployed and restless sociologist who becomes obsessed with a beat-up yellow Chevrolet that parks on the street across from his apartment. Sosa follows its owner—the wretched Jacinto Bustillo—for one day before he unceremoniously kills the man and discovers his secret: Bustillo owned a group of talking snakes, a tetramer of assassins Sosa takes to fondly calling his “ladies.” The snakes, who Sosa names Beti, Loli, Valentina, and Carmela, are the impetus for his transformation into Bustillo; terrified when he first realizes their presence, he quickly grasps: “If I could manage to keep myself under control... concentrate enough so they’d feel my vibrations and understand that I was the new Don Jacinto, I’d be saved.” They are also his accomplices, sustenance, and lovers as he goes on an impulsive rampage through the city, taking incidental revenge on those who wronged Bustillo and killing tens of other hapless individuals—who coincidentally are deeply involved in the politics of the city—along the way.
Moya makes a subtle gesture when he succeeds the narrator’s first-hand account with a more distanced, third-person exposé of the media and police’s scramble to curb the “snake invasion.” As Sosa relays the details of his crimes, his calm demeanor permeates his victims’ screams; “The din outside was tremendous. The ladies were in a kind of orgy, biting everything in sight... In just a few seconds the street had been destroyed. There were dozens of bodies lying twisted on the ground between the vendors’ stalls, as though there’d been a machine gun attack or an earthquake. I thought we shouldn’t call too much attention to ourselves. I opened the car door and yelled for them to come back. They came in excited and out of breath.” Sosa’s only exhibition of sincere sorrow comes when Valentina’s head is shot off during one confrontation. It is surprisingly easy to sympathize with the narrator; his offhand treatment of death renders the murders meaningless, and his intimate loneliness—as a man who relies on snakes for warmth—is more pitiful than disturbing. By comparison, the version of the crimes given by the media and the police seems like a bumbling, confused mess of tenuous hypotheses. Their powerlessness to keep up with Sosa is made more evident when the reader, already knowledgeable about the murders that have been committed, has to wade through the police department’s political conspiracy theories.
“Dance with Snakes” suggests the extent of Moya’s potential, but does not realize it fully. While “Senselessness,” published eight years later, was a horrific testimony of genocide, “Dance with Snakes” is an unsettling account of a narrator disillusioned with his own race. The novel gives a glimpse of the incredible emotional devastation that makes “Senselessness” such a disconcerting story of a man losing grip with his humanity, and it hints at Moya’s humor, with its fast-paced murder scheme that evokes the satirical comedy of Voltaire’s “Candide.” But more than a revelation of how developed Moya’s work would become, “Dance with Snakes” is a provocative take on what happens when a man on the fringes of society meets those entrenched in it.
For when the terror and destruction conclude, Sosa must reenter society—devastated and disoriented—alone once more. “I stumbled along, talking to myself, gesturing at the night, babbling. I called out to Loli. My love, my beautiful girl, come with me. I called out to Beti and Carmela, my princesses who had loved me so. Don’t leave me, my darlings, what will I do without you, where have you gone?” Yet despite the explosive display of power that sets Sosa fleeing from his snakes, Moya suggests that the man who has caused so much chaos will simply blend back into the world around him. Punished for being intractable, Sosa nevertheless manages to spite authority and replace a façade that fools those who tried to tame him. “Dance with Snakes” is a pointed critique of societal repression, whose value lies in its ability to infringe upon the prude sensitivities of human emotion and to make a renegade sympathetic, if not a hero.

There is no novel so great that I cannot put it down. I made it through a hundred and fifty pages of “War and Peace.” I called it quits on “Moby Dick” after the sixth chapter on the subtle complexities of whale oil. “Wuthering Heights” withered after seventy pages. “Gravity’s Rainbow” only lasted nine. I’ve accumulated a pretty impressive list of books that I’ve stopped reading. In fact, my growing catalog rivals many lists of the greatest novels ever written.
Whether it’s an overbearing workload, the death-march pace of classes with gargantuan reading lists, my own lackadaisical demeanor, or books that are three hundred pages too long, I constantly find myself tossing aside several unfinished books each semester. I like to think that I read more carefully and thoughtfully than other students, that it just takes me longer to read a book satisfactorily and that there isn’t enough time to finish everything. But my rationalization often ignores the embarrassing truth.
I usually make a judgment about a book after reading the first chapter; sometimes even the first page. If I don’t find a novel interesting, I generally stop, no matter how distinguished its literary pedigree. I quit reading “Kristin Lavransdatter” (Sigrid Undset’s Nobel-Prize winning historical romance set in 14th century Norway) after the first sentence, “When the earthly goods of Ivar Gjesling the Younger of Sundbu were divided up in the year 1306, his property at Sil was given to his daughter Ragnfrid and her husband Lavrans Bjorgulfson.” Perhaps I was unfair to Ms. Undset, but I do not regret my escape for a moment.
This phenomenon is hardly unique to me. It has become an epidemic among our generation. Rather than vainly lamenting the trend, it is more pragmatic to analyze it. The most useful critical exercise we can perform is to examine candidly why people stop reading a book rather than focusing on why people start reading books. Usually someone does not stop reading a novel for a sharply-defined ideological reason, but rather because the book failed to engage them. Is it possible sometimes the book is to blame and not the reader? Countless thinkers have offered explanations for this problem, but few actually explore the qualities of the literature itself that might distance books from their potential readers.
Some naysayers pontificate about the imminent death of literature because young people don’t read anymore. They often cite the waning attention span of younger generations arising from technology. Harold Bloom said in an interview that the problem is primarily a result of technological change: “People are trapped in the age of what you might call the triple screen: the motion-picture screen—and this is in ascending order of evil in terms of what it does to their minds throughout the world—the television screen, and finally the computer screen, which is the real villain.” Mr. Bloom extends his argument further in his book “How to Read and Why” by asserting that in the age of the internet “information is endlessly available to us. Where shall wisdom be found?”
This line of reasoning goes on to argue that today’s children, raised in this hi-tech age obsessed with the speed of information and communication, no longer have the patience necessary to read works of any length. My dad never misses an opportunity to wax nostalgic about the lost simplicity of his childhood when he sees me working on the computer with four other windows open while listening to music and having a conversation on iChat.
Novels are antithetical to the hasty lifestyle of today’s world. Reading forces us to pause our own lives in order to inhabit the consciousness of another being. One of the great discoveries of reading is that slowing down life allows one to appreciate the world more deeply. Many believe that it is exactly this ability to slow down life that has become increasingly difficult and uninteresting for younger generations.
While there may be some truth in the claims about cultural decline, I believe the issue is more complicated. It’s reductive and overly deterministic to claim literature is doomed because it’s an antiquated technology in the modern era. In fact, the very reasons some critics cite for the death of reading prove why literature is especially essential for our generation.
Reading pulls us away from an environment flooded with constant activity. It forces us to cast aside everything else and give undivided attention to a book for a sustained period of time. The contrast between the calm of the printed page and the frenetic pace of contemporary life is greater today than for any previous generation. Technology intensifies the interior world of self-reflection found by reading literature because it is so different than the rest of our lives. Paradoxically, the current technological age heightens the particular power of literature—making books truly indispensable to our generation.
This conclusion permits the question: If books are so valuable, why is it so easy for students to stop reading them? There is no single answer or simple explanation to this issue, but I think there are valid intellectual and emotional reasons why books often fail to engage with young readers that run far deeper than shortened attention span or the temptations of Facebook. Attempting to understand the multifaceted roots of this trend is critical for comprehending literature’s role in the future.
I remain convinced that our generation loves literature. Whether people enjoy fiction for the lowbrow thrills of adventure and basic storytelling or they savor the intellectual pleasures of literary novels, I’ve found that pretty much anyone can enjoy reading. Now more than ever it is critical to re-evaluate how younger generations view and interact with literature. In the meantime, it looks like my list is about to get longer.

“Now that we’re older, there’s more that we must do,” claims the chorus of “Slush,” the sixth track of Hot Chip’s eagerly anticipated new album, “One Life Stand.” These lyrics may well have been the mantra guiding the album’s creation, because with their fourth studio record, the British electropop group’s ability to integrate seemingly incongruous elements into a single fluid masterpiece has finally come to full fruition.
On “One Life Stand,” Hot Chip debuts a newly stripped-down aesthetic that effortlessly combines soulful ballads with synth effects and electronic distortion, juxtaposing simple, romantic lyrics with dance beats that wouldn’t disappoint a fist-pumping Jersey Shore guido. Where previous tracks incorporated gimmicks like the jarringly self-referential lyrics on “The Warning” or the inexplicable two minutes of grating synth noises on “Shake a Fist,” the tracks on “One Life Stand” replace them with a new, fully developed sound. This new direction features subtler synthesizers and an expanded instrumental palette, capitalizing on the entrancing beauty of lead singer Alexis Taylor’s voice.
The title track and first single epitomizes this new sound. Taylor’s vocals masterfully intertwine with the electronic beats and synth effects, rising to a quasi-falsetto on the chorus as he sets the album’s romantic mood with an endearing pun: “I only want to be your one life stand / Tell me do you stand by your whole man?” Vocals are given similar emphasis throughout the album’s slower tracks, including the beautiful “Slush,” which transfixes with its contemplative simplicity as Taylor’s singing weaves and dips against simple backing vocals. This focus on Taylor’s voice, supported by Joe Goddard’s harmonies, infuses the music with the soulful purity and coherence that was suggested, but never fully realized, by the group’s past albums. On tracks like “Brothers” and “Alley Cats,” layering of multiple voices results in a richness that allows the album’s themes of love and interpersonal connection to delve beyond the simply playful and enter the realm of the emotionally stirring, as with the poetic line, “You painted a song / It started when I was young and now it is in my lungs.”
The album’s upbeat songs complement these introspective ballads. The opening track, “Thieves in the Night,” instantly demands attention with its electrifying backdrop of persistent beats and darting synth effects. These form a satisfying contrast with Taylor’s plaintive call of “Baby I’ve lost you here in the crowd / Open your arms, I want to be found.” Elsewhere, “I Feel Better” features infectious strings and dance floor-ready auto-tuned vocals, while “We Have Love” brims with electronic effects and a catchy chorus: “We have love / Give it up, give it up / There is nothing else to be proud of.” This presence of upbeat, engaging  songs on “One Life Stand” ensures a continuation of Hot Chip’s legacy of eccentric, genre-bending dance floor fodder.
Hot Chip’s inclusion of a broader range of guest instruments contributes to the album’s effective new sound. Outside collaborators include Fimber Bravo, who plays steel pans on the title track, as well as drummers Charles Hayward of post-punk legends This Heat, and Leo Taylor of post-rock band The Invisible. The upbeat “Hand Me Down Your Love” is driven by a prominent piano line; however, it also includes a powerfully distorted refrain alongside its developed instrumentation and the pure simplicity of the vocals. This combination of disparate elements into a cohesive piece allows the track to fizzle with the uniquely appealing tension that defines the record.
The cohesion of “One Life Stand” marks a high point in Hot Chip’s career. The group have produced many great singles, but this is the first time they have crafted an entire LP of individually worthy, yet ultimately unified songs. “One Life Stand” is a well-crafted and multilayered record, marking a new stage in Hot Chip’s meteoric rise.

“He took off his suit coat as if it were a T-shirt, thrusting the back over his head and turning his sleeves inside out. Then he found himself grabbing the hem, a hand on each half of the parted tail, and ripping the thing in two. Hard to break the seam at first, but once the first thread snapped, it went.”
There is something cruelly funny about the image of a middle-aged corporate lawyer struggling to tear a custom-tailored suit with his bare hands. It almost belongs more in Joshua Ferris’ debut, “Then We Came to the End”—an acrid satire of the cubicle workplace—or the sitcom “The Office” than in his new novel “The Unnamed.” Though Ferris retains his humor in his new book, he seems to have adjusted its saturation levels. While the comedy of “Then We Came to the End” was tinged with pathos, “The Unnamed” is tragic, but gilded with heartbreaking humor. While previously Ferris might have left this character shouting obscenities or doing something equally outrageous, here Tim is left collapsed in the arms of his wife, as eviscerated as his expensive work-wear.
Tim Farnsworth, a partner at a high-profile Manhattan law firm, is afflicted with sudden bouts of uncontrollable walking. Despite the strong deterrent of an East Coast winter and the responsibilities he may have to his family and job, Tim walks for hours—unsure of his destination, unable to stop, and unconcerned with his bodily pains. Eventually these hours become years. Despite countless visits to doctors and more dubious specialists, the cause of the walking remains unknown and the disease unnamed, thus the novel’s title.
In tearing apart his suit, Tim turns the daily routine of changing after work into something eccentric—an act of destruction and frustration. Mirroring this act throughout the novel, Ferris takes the typical—corporate America, illness, marriage, and mortality—and reinvigorates it. “The Unnamed” is a poignant, though not always cohesive narrative. A subplot at Tim’s office involving a murder investigation—a trial that he botched when he took ill—distracts from the account of his illness and its effects on those around him. Nevertheless, Tim’s psychological journey remains the compelling heart of the novel.
Exasperated by the illness’s return, Tim rips his suit just as it will tear apart his seemingly perfect life—complete with an attractive, loving wife, a high-paying job that he loves, and an 8-bedroom mansion in the suburbs. Sensing his oncoming relapse, Tim contemplates what he stands to lose: “He was going to lose the house and everything in it. The rare pleasure of a bath, the copper pots hanging above the kitchen island, his family—again he would lose his family. He stood just inside the door and took stock. Everything in it had been taken for granted.” This is not simply a story about one man and his tragic fall—rather, the novel chronicles a disease as it ravages a man, his family, and his life.
Ferris effectively uses the illness as a foil to the pernicious corporate environment to which Tim belongs, taking up the critique that he began in his first novel, but on a different front. It is this premise of two opposing ailments as they compete for Tim’s life that distinguishes “The Unnamed” from among a field of clichéd and poorly written romantic tragedies.
As he surveys his rococo carpets and marble counter, Tim only sees the material objects that his corporate job handed him—failing to recognize the family that it had already taken away. His relationships with his wife and daughter have been unknowingly frayed because of his long hours and lack of emotional presence. Though the illness steals the tangible comforts—the house, the office with a view, and even a few frostbitten fingers and toes­it leaves behind the immaterial and the eternal—love, devotion, and his mind. By forcing Tim to reevaluate what is most important to him, the illness reverses the apathy and obliviousness that his job and fortune created in his personal life. He is compelled to value what he does have, renewing his relationship with his wife Jane and beginning one with his daughter Becka, until then largely ignored.
Years after the first attack of the disease, Jane and Becka are still unaccustomed to the worry that grips them as they ride in the car, searching for a lone hunched figure as he limps on. Becka, who was at first suspicious of the reality of her father’s illness, finds a renewed sense of compassion for her his struggles: “She felt the deep deficit of not being omniscient and the insecurity of human limitations that a time of crisis lays bare. They’d never find him. They had already passed him. He was standing in front of them mile after mile but they were too blind and frantic to see.” Not only does the disease afflict Tim; it torments his wife and daughter as they realize their inability to find, comfort, and save him. Ferris painstakingly captures the psychology of each member of the Farnsworth family, as they cycle through anger, indignation, grief, resignation, and acceptance—sometimes alone and sometimes together.
Ferris is at his best when he focuses on Tim’s struggle with his illness, his job, and his family life. But in intermittently weaving a murder mystery through the novel, Ferris fractures the stylistic, thematic, and narrative unity without adding much to the development of characters or plot. Grisham-like clichés interrupt a compelling account of sickness and struggle. Bland elementary characters from this extraneous and gratuitously blood-spattered thriller story-line are introduced and annoyingly revisited.
Though this ridiculously out-of-place whodunit detracts from the success of the work as a whole, it does not do quite the damage that Tim does to his suit jacket. Ferris sustains his novel with lyrical sentences and piercing images—a wife and daughter squinting in the dark to spot a man lost in his own body, a ripped suit and a grown man on his knees, and expensive copper pots sparkling in the light, unused. In “The Unnamed,” Ferris begins to depart from the theatrical and outlandish antics of his literary debut, tackling a story of emotional turmoil and loss with stirring power.

Yeasayer finally know what they want. Though they have distinguished themselves with their myriad cultural influences, the Brooklyn-based trio now challenge their reputation for eclecticism with a more focused, concentrated sound and an unapologetic drive to make themselves heard.
“Odd Blood” is Yeasayer’s first release since their 2007 breakout LP “All Hour Cymbals.” Where “Cymbals” haphazardly imitated everything from West African rhythms to Middle-Eastern pop, “Odd Blood” is decidedly paired-down, although not without foreign influences. The abundance of pop hooks on this album suggests that Yeasayer spent most of their recent downtime in a trashy European discothèque, and loved absolutely every moment of it.
This shift in musical direction is particularly surprising given the band’s previous taste for less instantly gratifying melodies and seriously-minded lyrics. The lyrics on “Odd Blood” continue to be somewhat off-putting, creating an interesting juxtaposition with the band’s new melodic style. This especially stands out on the infectious single “O.N.E.” when lyrics like, “No, you don’t move me anymore / And I’m glad that you don’t / ‘Cause I can’t have you anymore,” offer a stark contrast to the happy-go-lucky mood of the music.
Yeasayer have not forgotten the past, but simply evolved their sound from a ritualistic one into a futuristic one. Unpredictable melodies on tracks like “Grizelda” and “Strange Reunions” serve as reminders of the band’s earlier work, but these are exceptions to the forward-moving, electric sound of the rest of “Odd Blood.” This feeling of forwardness is largely due to a change in percussion use from “Cymbals.” The band has eschewed their old tricks of changing rhythm and meter for drumbeats that are consistent throughout almost every track, which avoids monotony and instead highlights their apt use of electronic melodies and driving vocals.
The band’s newfound drive and self-assuredness is quite evident in their lyrics. “Ambling Alp” features a father advising, “Stick up for yourself, son”; on “Rome,” the protagonist declares, “Rome is gonna be mine / It’s just a matter of time;” even “O.N.E.’s” somewhat passive narrator declares, “I won’t stop ‘til I’ve given you up.” Yeasayer are no longer waiting for the summer, wintertime, or year 2080; they are asserting themselves and looking to seize their moment.
Along with this move towards a more confident and accessible sound, the band has for the first time tackled the most overdone subject matter in pop: love. On “I Remember,” Chris Keating croons, “You’re stuck in my mind all the time,” and even sings, “With you I’d die today.” But do not be fooled into thinking Yeasayer have gone soft. They still find ways to work their fresh confidence into this more traditional type of song. “Love Me Girl” is hardly a passive request for female attention, and the title phrase is one of the more demanding ways to attempt to save a failing relationship. Though these songs show a more accessible side of the band, they still rely on Yeasayer’s talents for great songcraft, and these creations succeed in transcending the banality of many love songs.
The album’s arc is one of the few ways Yeasayer actually fall short of fully expressing their newfound confidence. “The Children,” which opens the album, is less melodic and upbeat than the other nine tracks, and therefore seems more of a prologue than an actual component of the record’s aesthetic. Additionally, later album cuts such as “Grizelda” are much more in keeping with Yeasayer’s earlier sound, contradicting the development displayed on the rest of the album. Closing the record with these less ambitious tracks leaves something of a disappointing aftertaste as the promise of the rest of the album is left somewhat unfulfilled. The middle tracks, notably “Ambling Alp,” “Love Me Girl,” and “O.N.E.” are where the band truly shines. These songs showcase Yeasayer’s sophisticated musical talents, their growth, and their ability to create something utterly catchy yet completely in line with their innovative style. It is these songs that define “Odd Blood,” and prove that Yeasayer are not just a band that want to be heard, but a band that know how to make that happen.

Seven years in the making, “Heligoland” has kept Massive Attack fans waiting a long time. Finally, this British trip-hop duo is releasing their fifth studio album, their first since 2003. Though, in their absence, Massive Attack has been somewhat eclipsed by their contemporaries—most notably the recently-reunited Portishead—“Heligoland” marks a bold resurgence into the musical scene for duo Robert Del Naja and Grant Marshall. Massive Attack’s new record is a dark dreamscape, totally engrossing in its vigor, proving that “Heligoland” was well worth the wait.
On this LP as elsewhere, Massive Attack’s music can tend towards the formulaic. Take a catchy beat, drench it in spare, sinister loops, mix in some guest vocals and voilá—the songs on “Heligoland” rarely deviate from the template. As a result, it’s sometimes easy for the tracks to fall into a lull or feel stagnant. “Girl I Love You” and “Flat of the Blade,” though solid tracks overall, are prime examples of this kind of stasis, failing to offer any novel interpretation of what Massive Attack have been doing for years.
At the same time, however, the band prove that sticking to a formula, if the method of choice is strong enough, can produce stunning results. And when all is said and done, “Heligoland” subscribes to a pretty good method. Nobody does the bleak soundscapes and skittering breakbeats that characterize trip-hop, which Massive Attack themselves helped pioneer, to greater effect than Del Naja and Marshall. So for the most part, the songs of “Heligoland” are highly successful. These ten tracks are united around a dark, chilling vision that completely absorbs the listener into the album’s world.
The record opens with “Pray for Rain,” a song composed with such a hypnotic vigor that it risks eclipsing most of the tracks to come. A seething piano loop winds its way through cascading drum fills while Tunde Adebimpe (of TV on the Radio fame) warbles chilling lyrics laced with somber imagery—“Dull residue of what once was / A shattered cloud of swirling doves.” The song also has a more distinct arc than any other on the album. It’s the only track with a clear bridge, and it builds to a climactic resolution that inundates the listener in an icy, placid pool of electronic harmonies. The end product is a song that grips with remarkable force, immediately establishing the album’s dark, baleful atmosphere.
“Paradise Circus”—the album’s other exceptional track—starts with the simple, skeletal chiming of piano and the glassy ambiance of vibraphone. A heavy bass line kicks in soon thereafter, and drives the song to the album’s musical apex. Mazzy Star’s Hope Sandoval lends her voice to this particular track, and her airy recitation of the lyrics only adds to the disquieting mood of the song. “Oh well, the devil makes us sin,” she coos, “but we like it when we’re spinning in his grip.” At its conclusion, sweeping strings elevate the sinister tone of the song to a truly overwhelming effect.
Along with Adebimpe and Sandoval, Massive Attack enlist the help of several guest artists to varying degrees of success. Eight of the ten tracks borrow vocals from other musicians, and for the most part, their efforts are much appreciated. There’s a great deal of variety in the voices that carry the melodies of “Heligoland,” a welcome dose of diversity on an album that tends towards monotony in its musical textures.
One of these appearances is less than impressive, however—that of Horace Andy, a reggae musician and an oft-collaborator of Massive Attack. Andy appears on two tracks to a disconcerting effect, as his voice feels grossly misplaced in the middle of these songs. For instance, he lends his deep, raspy bass to the first single off the album, “Splitting the Atom,” and his vocals sound too breathy for the song’s sleek backdrop, distracting from one of the best musical compositions on the album.
In spite of such minor flaws, however, “Heligoland” is a resounding success. While the past seven years may have seemed like a great hiatus in music-making, the efforts that went into this album were clearly time-intensive, and they were not wasted. With a host of tracks that are at once arresting, menacing, and beautiful, “Heligoland” reestablishes Massive Attack’s captivating musical aesthetic and proves to be a bold reminder that Del Naja and Marshall are still going as strong as ever.

On their newest album, “The Courage of Others,” Texas band Midlake strays from the energetic alternative rock of previous releases towards a folk-inspired, pastoral sound. Lead vocalist and songwriter Tim Smith attempts to conjure a wintry atmosphere with delicate acoustic guitar and lyrics about cycles of death and rebirth. Unfortunately, while he does manage to capture a sense of stillness and bleakness, there is no suggestion of spring to come, and the gloomy minor key sustained throughout leaves the listener wanting to hibernate rather than go for a romp in the snow.
Midlake’s past albums, 2004’s “Bamnan and Slivercork” and 2006’s “The Trials of Van Occupanther,” had an indie rock aesthetic which featured traditional songwriting structure and driving beats. On “The Courage of Others” they move to a more folk-based sound, sacrificing the elements of their past for an emphasis on harmonies and atmospheric mood-creation. Unfortunately, these harmonies and moods aren’t sophisticated enough to consistently sustain interest.
The album’s greatest strength is its innovative instrumentation—the original quintet met studying jazz at the University of North Texas, and their training is apparent in the skillfully layered keyboard, classical guitar, and flute arrangements. In addition, Smith’s clear and gentle voice is a pleasure to listen to, although on most tracks he unwisely sacrifices his voice to the limited range of the melodies.
Opening track “Acts of Man,” sets the tone lyrically and harmonically for the rest of the album. The song is rather static: Smith sings within a restricted vocal range, and the lyrics consist of a repeated chant: “If all that grows starts to fade, starts to falter / Oh, let me inside, let me inside, not to wait / Great are the sounds of all that live / And all that man can hold.” While the lyrics refer to both the barrenness of winter and earth’s hidden bounty, the minor key in which the song is written and Smith’s monotone do not give a sense of eventual thawing and renewal. The track that follows, “Winter Dies,” continues this pattern. Smith sings that “Winter dies / The Earth is brought to life,” but this hopeful message is not reflected in the song’s harmonic structure. Midlake might have been able to craft a sense of expectancy and dormant growth by deftly manipulating harmony and melody, but instead they create it using not-so-subtle lyrics.
This incongruity continues until the fourth track, “Fortune,” on which the band’s intentions are beautifully realized. The absence of heavy handed and uninteresting electric guitar riffs—which in previous tracks drown out otherwise intricate instrumentation—allows the acoustic guitar to shine through. Smith’s clear and tender vocals are here successfully highlighted. Liberated by the more varied melody, Smith weaves a narrative that is less mournful and more hopeful than those of the other tracks. For just over two minutes the clouds part, and Midlake captures a poignant sense of winter that is not all doom and gloom.
However, the magic is lost in the next track, “Rulers, Ruling All Things,” on which Smith and the band forget what made “Fortune” successful, reverting to the droning sound and seemingly insincere angst of the earlier tracks. The album reaches a low point on the aptlytitled “Bring Down,” with its melodramatic lyrics: “Pray for all to end / And silence be all / Now the joy has burned out and it’s gone / But I don’t know where.”
The album ends with “In the Ground,” which sounds quite similar to the first track, “Acts of Man.” The subject matter, vocals, and music all have exactly the same feel, showing how the album lacks overall direction. Just as each individual song feels static, lacking a swelling or diminishing of emotion, the album as a whole shows no development through the tracks, and we feel that Smith hasn’t taken us anywhere. That said, Midlake offers its fans an instrumentally original, if not enthralling, listen. Unfortunately, though, “The Courage of Others” forces the listener to hunt for its strengths, which are too often obscured beneath a less appealing surface.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off her win for Best Classical Vocal Performance at this year’s Grammy awards, Renée Fleming arrives today at Harvard to coach four undergraduates chosen by the Office for the Arts in a master class open to the public. While these students might be understandably nervous singing before America’s premier soprano, they have no reason to be. Fleming is as beloved for her warmth of manner and golden personality as for her voice. After her visit to Harvard, she will perform with the Boston Symphony Orchestra from February 11 to February 13 at Boston Symphony Hall.
The Harvard Crimson: You are often hailed as the American opera singer of our time, an American musical statesman. What do you think of this role?
Renée Fleming: I love that. As an American, I’m not pigeonholed into a specific repertoire. I’m allowed to sing in any language. Ninety percent of the time, I’m singing in 8-10 foreign languages. It’s very fun as an American to be able to display this eclecticism that we have.
THC: Do you listen to opera at home?
RF: When I listen to classical music, it draws my whole attention. So I’m very careful not to do that unless I’m working on something because I just find it too distracting.
THC: Soon the Academy Awards will take place, and these actors will be admired the world over and their gowns and coiffures scrutinized in every entertainment magazine. Do you ever wish that opera had as much mainstream appeal as film or pop music?
RF: It’s coming along. What I would like to see happen is for opera not to become less popular than it is, for us not to lose ground, to lose audience members. One thing that has helped enormously with that are the HD simulcasts [from the Metropolitan Opera in New York].
THC: You’re admired not only for your singing, but for your acting abilities. Would you ever consider taking a role in something purely dramatic?
RF: I would love to do that; it would be a lot of fun. It’s funny—in opera, the pitches are dictated, the timing is dictated, the composer has written everything down. And I memorize everything through the music. So it would be very interesting to see what would work.  Would my speaking voice sound funny? Would I be able to manage the timing? It would be an interesting challenge.
THC: Do you find that when singing opera you lose yourself in your characters, that their worries become yours, that their amours burn hot in your own heart?
RF:  Oh yes, that’s what acting is, in a way. I prefer the singers who seem to forget that they’re singing. It’s very important. There’s a layering process. I feel sympathy for the person that I’m portraying, and I become her. But then I also substitute whatever their raw emotion is with my own experiences.
THC: What was it like to sing “You’ll Never Walk Alone” from Carousel at President Barack Obama’s Inaugural Celebration concert?
RF: That was really thrilling. It was a moment where I thought, “Everything has come together.” I knew the piece well. I love singing it. And it was an incredible honor to be a part of this historic event.
THC: How do you approach teaching the younger generation in a master class setting?
RF: I try to be very direct and honest about what I hear and, at the same time, encouraging. It takes a lot of courage to get up and sing in a master class because you’re basically allowing yourself to be publicly criticized. I want people to feel comfortable, I want to be helpful without getting people too confused.
THC: What about your visit are you most looking forward to?
RF: I’m really interested in seeing what students at Harvard bring to music and to see how an education of that quality informs how someone performs. It’s not lost on me that Yo-Yo Ma went to Harvard, developed, and became Yo-Yo Ma.
Renée Fleming’s master class will take place in Paine Hall today at 3 PM.  Admission is free and open to the public.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive,” said Walt Disney of the cinematographic field he helped pioneer. Since Disney popularized animation however, its creative potential has been largely underestimated and the genre has often been relegated to essentially childish themes. Even animated films such as “Toy Story” and “Up,” that received widespread critical acclaim, attained commercial success by marketing themselves as movies intended for pre-teens.
The newest exhibition at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, “Frame by Frame: Animated at Harvard”—which runs through February 14—displays an entirely different kind of animation than movie theaters frequently feature. The show explores Harvard’s intriguing and largely untold history with animated film, beginning with the Visual and Environmental Studies Department’s first forays into the field in the mid-1960s and ending with student projects from as recently as last year. This animation timeline showcases a variety of films that have rigorously mined the imaginative possibilities of the form and, in doing so, proved that animation has potential beyond the merely cartoonish.
The main room of “Frame by Frame” is dominated by a rolling loop of Harvard’s first and most important efforts in animation. Renowned animator Eli F. Noyes ’64 made the earliest film on this loop, “Clay or the Origin of Species,” when he was a senior at Harvard. The film, which is one of the first animated movies to use clay and went on to receive the Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Subject, features charming clay imaginings of early forms of life and gradually culminates in the creation of humans.
Equally innovative is the 1968 film “Sand, or Peter and the Wolf” by filmmaker Caroline J. Leaf ’68. Leaf’s work is one of the earliest and best examples of the use of sand in animation, as she creates an ethereal, shapeshifting set of grainy black and white characters. Though its graphics appear rudimentary to today’s eye, Leaf’s film remains visually captivating. Leaf constantly recreates her characters’ forms, faces, and even species; in one scene, a wolf eats a bird that later morphs into an alternatively smiling and frowning moon.
The exhibition’s most successful movie is likely that of Frank P. Mouris ’66, whose “Frank Film” won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Subject in 1974 and has since been preserved in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.  Mouris’s film features two overlapping audio tracks: the filmmaker lists words beginning with the letter “F” while also telling his own life story. At the same time, an ever-shifting collage of magazine clippings appears on the screen. These stock images range from depictions of the Buddha to packs of cigarettes and appear in coordination with Mouris’s narrative. For example, when Mouris explains his middle and high school crushes, the screen fills up completely with drawings of eyes and lips.
The backroom of the exhibition presents more recent efforts in animation at Harvard. Four televisions showcase work by current students and recent alums. Another screen shows a short film of the exhibition’s co-curator, Terah L. Maher, along with the sheets of clay sandwiched in Plexiglas that were used to make the movie. The students’ films track a wide range of graphic and conceptual complexity. A work by Lisa A. Haber-Thomson ’02 consists exclusively of stick figures, but deals with the beautiful image of a woman trying to stitch together a torn book as letters pour out of it to the sound of running water. “Pop,” a film by Sarah M. Ngo ’13, shows a perfectly-drawn girl in a simplistic world surrounded by fish who repeatedly “pop” and disappear.
Despite the scholarly bent of “Frame by Frame,” a few families were in attendance. Cambridge mother Alix Kepner had taken her nine year-old daughter Gemma to see the exhibition. “We’re big Pixar fans,” explained Kepner when asked about what had brought them to the Carpenter Center. Talking about her favorite film, “Going Up,” Gemma said, “I liked the script.” When her mother commented that the film in question did not feature any words, Gemma replied, “You don’t need words—pictures can say a lot.” The films in “Frame by Frame” still hold charm for children like Gemma, suggesting that the medium maintains its wonder.

“We’re so content it’s a cliché,” says schoolboy Wes Sidestory in “Commie Dearest,” the 162nd production of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals (HPT). Yet there’s nothing clichéd about this eccentric portrayal of a 1950s-era American town, where humans, aliens, robots, and potatoes abound.
The vibrantly colorful cast’s pursuit of the typical American dream—in the delightfully ironic form of a bowling trophy—is, of course, anything but standard. The Pudding’s characteristic whirlwind of big personalities, stunning costume and set design, cultural references, ludicrous jokes, and clever puns make “Commie Dearest” a wild ride that, while often an exhilaratingly hilarious experience, is also just as frequently dizzying and lackluster.
“Commie Dearest” is the second brainchild of Alexandra A. Petri ’10 and Megan L. Amram ’10, writers of last year’s hit HPT production “Acropolis Now.” Directed by Tony Parise, the new show will run at the New College Theatre until March 7th.
The show starts off with a rapid succession of witty allusions to 1950s-era racism and misogyny that, although funny and on-point, pile on top of each other so quickly it’s easy to miss a laugh. General Dwight Supremacy (Michael L. Blumenthal ’11) comically insists that his wife Sadie Magicword (Walter B. Klyce ’10) “overcame a lot of diversity,” while she exclaims that her only education is “home grammar,” from which she has learned that “the woman is always an object.”
General Dwight, Sadie, their daughter Bobbie Sox (Kyle J. Dancewicz ’11), and a slew of other colorful characters compete to win the American Dream contest presented by pitcher Doug Out (Adam M. Lathram ’10) and half-fish starlet Marlin Monroe (Clifford N. Murray ’10). Communist conspirators Sasha Frigidvich (Andrew F. Cone ’11) and Spud Nick (Ryan P. Halprin ’12) later burst onto the scene and try to steal the American Dream in an attempt to win the Cold War.
A subplot between Desi Speakenglish (Matthew I. Bohrer ’10) and his robot Betty Boopbeepboopboop (Daniel V. Kroop ’10) lacks the humor and energy of the main storyline. Set in a stereotypical 1950s restaurant, “Desi’s Diner,” the scene that introduces these two characters drags down the momentum of the show’s opening with uninteresting choreography, weak vocal performances, and consistently unfunny references to computer applications and the Internet that seem out of place. The character of Desi Speakenglish, while mildly amusing, is neither well developed nor particularly exciting, and Bohrer’s performance lacks the force that would give the role a stronger sense of purpose.
For every weaker moment or duller joke, however, there are a handful of stellar performances that make “Commie Dearest” a delight to watch. Murray delivers every joke so naturally that even some of the simplest ones end up standing out: “Life is like a cereal, it comes in a box and it’s called Life.” Cone’s performance is consistently strong, from his ridiculous Russian accent to his ludicrous facial expressions and gestures. Dancewicz and Klyce perform a duet, “Let the Men Handle It,” that is by far the show’s best musical moment; both voices are powerful and the entire scene is cohesive, energetic, and humorous.
While “Let the Men Handle It” stands out both for its lyrics and singing, other numbers lack the same exhilarating quality. Overall, however, the script is clever enough to keep the audience engaged and the play moving forward. The talented orchestra maintains the upbeat tempo  in every number and the musical composition—by Alex B. Lipton ’11—suits the witty lyrics.
Even with occasional microphone issues that distract from the music, several actors—such as Klyce and Derek S. Mueller ’10—are professional enough to overcome the technical problems. As Olive Lucy, Mueller delivers one of the best-acted performances in the production. He fully engages with his character, and his range of expression is emphatic and appropriate without being overdone. His solo bowling alley scene is also one of the funniest and most cleverly written in the show, revealing that it is in fact boozing, not bowling, that is truly “the most American pastime.”
The choreography improves considerably toward the end of “Commie Dearest,” finishing off the play with a ludicrous, characteristically Pudding-style bang that leaves the audience wanting more.Three characters in gas masks perform a hilarious dance that starts off as militaristic marching and, in a matter of minutes, unravels into a raunchy strip tease. Vibrant, elaborate costumes enhance the outrageous acting and compliment the choreography, especially in the show’s final kickline. This kickline brings yet another unexpected twist to the motley crew of crazy characters who inhabit this unconventional town, ultimately revealing a side of the 1950s that, once familiar, is now transported into a new dimension.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was applying to colleges, I started out by listing the cities that I was willing to live in and narrowing my search from there. Yet here I am, two and a half years later, and while I’ve been to the Museum of Fine Arts more times than I can count and I’ve gazed at the windows of the art galleries on Beacon Street, I still can’t really say I know Boston. It was only after I spent the past semester in Paris  over just four months, visiting dozens of museums, galleries, arts fairs, and artists’ studios, that I realized how little I get out of Harvard Square.
It’s easy to put off sightseeing—“until it’s warmer,” I tell myself, “until I have less work.” Well, friends, it won’t be warm for months and work seems endless, so it’s time to stop making excuses, lace up those walking shoes, and soak up the local arts scene.
There’s no need to venture too far from the Sqaure to find plenty of interesting contemporary public artwork. Cambridge is the only city in Massachusetts with a law mandating that 1% of public funds spent on construction projects be put towards public art.
On a recent two-hour break between classes, I hopped on the T to the Kendall/MIT stop, where an art installation by Paul Matisse allows passengers to play mobile-like instruments hanging between the tracks. The piece, called “The Kendall Band,” is composed of three elements that you might mistake for part of the machinery: “Kepler,” an aluminum ring that hums for five minutes after being struck; “Pythagoras,” a 48-foot row of aluminum chimes interspersed with teak hammers; and “Galileo,” a large steel sheet that clatters when the handle is shaken. Ok, Gare St. Lazare it ain’t but you have to give the MBTA props for trying.
As I followed the Charles towards the Cambridgeside Galleria, it called back fond memories of strolling along the Seine. I then came across Lloyd Hamrol’s playful “Gate House” sculptures. “Gate House” is comprised of three pointed steel archways painted in red, yellow, and blue to represent the brick characteristic of Cambridge architecture, the leaves of the New England autumn, and the local maritime tradition, respectively. Among the best known creators of public art in Cambridge, Hamrol has had his work exhibited at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., the Whitney Museum in New York, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. As I stood in the center of the three sculptures, looking up at the arches, I was reminded of standing in Notre-Dame. “Gate House” is less awe-inspiring, sure, but also less intimidating—like an outdoor cathedral for kids.
Just past the mall is Canal Park, where a number of public art works are installed. For his bronze “Tower of East Cambridge Faces,” sculptor James Tyler wandered the neighborhood with a camera looking for fifty distinctive mugs. One looked curiously like Drew Faust and I wondered if perhaps she had been in the area when Tyler was scouting his models.
On the other side of the park, under the gazebo, David Phillips’ “Beach Fragments” go almost unnoticed. The bronze medallions contain a mix of imagery drawn from marine biology, astronomy, particle physics, and even music, featuring a line from Debussy’s “La Mer.” But it is the nearby “Never Green Tree” which rightfully ends up stealing the spotlight. Former Graduate School of Design professor William Wainwright’s “Never Green Tree” is a unique and innovative fusion of art and science. It features dozens of cubic aluminium leaves, hanging from the steel frame, with prismatic surfaces that deflect the light into a rapidly changing pattern of color reminiscent of being under the disco ball at a club.
My final stop (and a welcome break from the cold) was the small Multicultural Arts Center at 41 Second St. The fascinating and moving photography exhibit, entitled “IRAN: Images from Beneath a Chador,” will be on view through March 19. The photographer, Randy H. Goodman, happened to stop by while I was there and explained how she wound up, at age 24, armed with only a camera and a degree in political economy, documenting the Iran hostage crisis. Aside from this particular exhibit The Multicultural Arts Center is definitely worth a repeat visit as it hosts a plethora of exhibits and events including jazz concerts and dance performances.
My expedition took a mere two hours but as I hopped on the 69 bus on Cambridge St. to make my way back to campus in time for my next class, I smiled, feeling like I’d managed to bring a little piece of the Baudelaire’s flâneur to Beantown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Writing not long after the death of Leonardo da Vinci, art historian and biographer Giorgio Vasari described the late master’s “Mona Lisa,” placing special emphasis on the lady’s uncanny simper. “And in this work of Leonardo’s there was a smile so pleasing, that it was a thing more divine than human to behold; and it was held to be something marvelous, since the reality was not more alive,” he wrote. The sublime expression of “La Joconde” has held sway over its viewers since its creation, a testament to its creator’s artistry, a manifestation of the fantastic in the earthly realm.
Enter Dr. Margaret S. Livingstone, Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, whose research focuses on human visual perception. Livingstone realized that while contemporary art historians like Ernst Gombrich are not wrong in their analysis of “Mona Lisa,” there’s a science to da Vinci’s masterpiece that had yet to be fully explained. Analyzing the work in terms of its spatial frequencies, Livingstone revealed that the lower spatial frequencies, best seen by the peripheral vision, make the figure appear to smile, while at higher frequencies the smile almost vanishes. Laying one famous enigma to rest, however, calls up a host of other questions: what more can science uncover by turning its gaze on art­—or, conversely, what can art teach the scientists? And just how important is a foundation in one field for an understanding of the other?
BLURRING THE LINES
Livingstone is far from alone in her exploration of the science animating works of art. Many of her colleagues, including some at Harvard, pursue similar interests; they channel their curiosity about human visual perception into an artistic study or use scientific findings to explain some of the fundamental principles that underlie works of art. The Vision Sciences Laboratory, located in William James Hall and run by a group of psychology professors, explores this very chiasm in their experiments—though their approach is slightly different than Livingstone’s.
“You might think that the Vision Lab works on the software more than the hardware,” says Patrick Cavanagh, Professor of Psychology and Co-Director of the lab. Diverging from Livingstone’s approach, which Cavanagh relates to disassembling an Xbox to figure out what’s going on inside, the Vision Sciences Laboratory conducts tests on individual subjects in order to ascertain when and how their powers of perception fall short. By presenting subjects with pictures, actions, and events, the researchers hone in—be it through brain scanning or more simple tests of visual judgments—on perceptual errors, and induce the workings of the brain.
Cavanagh’s own research, which takes the same approach, has led him to a number of discoveries about an “alternative physics” operating in representational artworks. Impossible shadows, reflections, and contours number among the artistic flaws surveyed in an article Cavanagh wrote for the science journal “Nature” entitled “Artists as Neuroscientists.” “Artists use this alternative physics because these particular deviations from true physics do not matter to the viewer,” he writes. “The artists can take shortcuts, presenting cues more economically, and arranging surfaces and lights to suit the message of the piece rather than the requirements of the physical world.”
Through a careful survey of many works of art, confirmed by experiments on perception, Cavanagh has discovered that the only requirements for realistic depictions of shadows are that they be transparent and darker than their immediate surroundings. He has shown that reflections, like shadows, are a mystery to the human mind; their representation in art has but a few of the limitations which govern reality. He maintains, in a similar vein as Livingstone, that Impressionist art is so appealing because intentional blurring may connect representations more directly to emotional centers in the brain rather than to conscious image-recognition areas. Cavanagh has even offered an explanation why flat, two-dimensional representations are effective, arguing that we do not experience the visual world as truly three-dimensional.
Implicit in all these findings is the understanding that the artists themselves must have had some knowledge of these very rules in order to replicate them in their works. And their comprehension of the weak points in human visual perception has become a boon to modern researchers. “You can figure out from artists and what they do just what the simple rules of vision are,” Cavanagh says. “And that’s a real advantage, it’s like lots of research done for free.”
Livingstone had a similar revelation early in her career. “I began to realize that artists, just like scientists, are doing experiments, and that a number of works of art reveal important things about how we see,” she says.
SYMBIOSIS OR PARASITISM?
Even while artists act like scientists and scientists like art historians, it is not easy to decipher the role the sciences should play in the expansive field of art history. While Cavanagh maintains that an understanding of human visual perception is helpful and informative in—if not essential to—the study of art, Livingstone understands that barriers do exist. While some scientific developments, like fractal analysis, have already swept the world of art history, she claims, others may not be accepted so easily by art historians. “Anything innovative takes time to be understood by the establishment, especially if it takes them outside their areas of expertise and comfort,” she writes in an email.
Indeed, some are less convinced of the merits of the scientific approach to artistic interpretation. “There’s a methodological problem at the core of the entire approach, and it has to do with consciousness and subconsciousness,” says Frank Fehrenbach, Professor of History of Art and Architecture. “What are you testing? What is your primary material? All these people [researchers] start with vocal response from their test persons. If you develop ideas about how art works on us then you determine that art must work on us in a certain way.”
Fehrenbach, familiar with the advances in neurobiology and psychology and what they offer art historians from a seminar he recently taught, says that a more science-oriented approach is a prominent channel in art history that seems to be gaining momentum. His concerns with it, however, range from the methodological issue mentioned above to more fundamental areas of disagreement.
On one hand, Fehrenbach argues that asking subjects to respond to a work of art to analyze what’s happening in the brain can’t offer anything more than simple questions to an audience or to oneself. On the other hand, he stresses that this type of research-oriented approach is only a new substitute for formalism and places an undue emphasis on immediate response. Neurological or psychological studies could easily fall short in explaining such instantaneous reactions. If scientists observe that subjects have similar responses to a work of art, can they necessarily prove that similar mental mechanisms are at work beneath them?
Touching again on the methodological, Fehrenbach recalls Margaret Livingstone’s explanation of Mona Lisa’s smile. “Now someone is giving us a scientific explanation for it, and there are a few ways that you can respond to it. First of all, you can say great, finally that has been explained by scientific fact. Or you can say, well does that mean, since I do not agree with the floating emotion in the Mona Lisa, does that mean that my neurologic apparatus is not okay? … I would simply say that all that neuroscience can provide is post-festum observations of what people already perceived on a fundamental level.”
Ultimately, the biggest problem for Fehrenbach is not the research itself or its impact on art history, but the implicit promise that we will be able to develop a new art theory. “It’s impossible to create a set of categories that would allow you to understand what art is or how it works on us,” he says.
Despite even these gravest of doubts, Fehrenbach admits that in certain areas the approaches taken by Cavanagh, Livingstone, and the Vision Sciences Laboratory in the interpretation of artworks could be a fertile foundation for greater understanding. These areas, however, are not particularly numerous; nor do they initially seem to offer the same boundless opportunity that researchers like Cavanagh envision in the confluence between art history and the science of perception.
COMING TO A COMPROMISE
Neither side in this discussion advocates a takeover or excision of one field from the other. To a certain extent, both seek to understand the membrane between art and science—the liminal area between art and science that has spawned many a discussion, particularly as the sciences continue to grow beyond the confines of their laboratories and into the cultural mainstream. Cavanagh, in discussing whether a background understanding of visual perception can inform the study of art, acknowledges that it certainly depends upon what the individual in question is interested in studying. He gives precedence to an understanding through symbolism and cultural context in many instances. Fehrenbach, too, occupies a bit of this middle ground: “To put the sensual part of art back on the agenda is absolutely important,” he says. “Art theory sometimes tends to contextualize too much, but it should start with the perceptual qualities of the object.”

Last month, Google threatened to exit China after discovering that some of its users’ accounts had been hacked by the Chinese government. Google’s declaration was quite weighty, considering China’s large economy and potentially huge market for the company. Most importantly, it brought to light the epic battle for cyber-security between one of the world’s largest technological companies and one of the world’s most secretive regimes. After deciding to remain in China but stay wary of censorship and human rights abuses, Google has called upon the National Security Administration to do what it does best: safeguard information exchange between people. Specifically, Google has asked the NSA to investigate how the hacking occurred, in order to ensure it never happens again.
We commend Google for teaming up with the NSA to protect and secure the privacy of its users. After all, the NSA is a natural ally for Google when ensuring that people’s accounts are not compromised such that the U.S. will face any danger. The NSA’s right to collect information it deems to be a threat to the American public is vested in President Ronald Reagan’s executive order on Dec. 4, 1981—the order allows certain federal agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, to gather information they deem to be a threat to national security. Indeed, China’s censorship put at stake some human rights activists and companies in the United States, and so it is appropriate for the NSA to be involved.
Yet we do not give the NSA carte blanche to collect as much information as they want from companies like Google—we caution against the collection of private information that does not threaten national security. In order to protect the American people, a partnership such as Google’s with the NSA should be limited to national security purposes. If the NSA uses this situation to obtain private information that is not necessary to provide for the common defense, Google users should reconsider the security of their information.
Still, when considering the censure of human rights activists and the implications for the involved Americans, Google did the right thing by calling upon America’s most watchful eye to fix a glitch in its computer systems. The onus is on Google to remedy a problem inherent in its systems, and it appears to be intent on doing so. Hopefully, other companies in similar situations will follow Google’s lead and also turn to the proper authorities, when appropriate.
The decision by the Chinese government to censor the activities of human rights activists within the country is upsetting, as is the fact that Google was unable to safeguard its users properly. Luckily, there is a silver lining to the predicament: the opportunity for positive collaboration between Google and the NSA in order to improve privacy worldwide.

This past summer, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. The first lunar landing was an extraordinarily complex, highly technical feat of human engineering and bravery, and while we remember it proudly, it is more than a little strange to celebrate a feat that we could do 40 years ago but cannot do today.
Although rarely able to travel out of Earth’s orbit, the space program in the U.S. has been highly active over the past few decades. The space shuttle has flown nearly 130 flights, and the International Space Station is entering its tenth year of operation. However, last week, President Obama cancelled the National Aeronautics and Space Administration program to build a next generation spacecraft to travel to the International Space Station and the moon, essentially “grounding” our human space flight program There are only four more scheduled space shuttle flights remaining. Following this, American astronauts will rely on Russian rockets to travel to the space station and back.
While the proposed 2011 budget allocates funds to incentivize private enterprises to design and build human-rated rockets and spacecraft, none have been tested and deemed ready for flight. Expanding access to space and engaging private enterprise is a worthy project, but this untested path should not be America’s only means of sending humans to space. There are also no funds to support a vision for space travel beyond the five to ten years of “life” left in the ISS. We should reconsider whether or not we want to forfeit America’s leadership in space exploration.
In addition to translating the dreams of today into tomorrow’s reality, space exploration furthers technological development, creates and maintains jobs in science and technology fields, expands our scientific knowledge, and inspires schoolchildren across the country to study science.
Many of us have grown to take NASA for granted. Our generation’s lack of understanding of the importance of space exploration was made evident by a 2007 survey revealing that young Americans between the ages of 18 and 25 showed high levels of apathy about sending astronauts to the moon and Mars. If space travel were once again important to Americans, maybe more children would be interested in pursuing careers in math, science, and engineering. Complex and difficult engineering and scientific endeavors cannot be accomplished without an educated workforce.
Furthermore, great countries, historically, have been those that have explored and searched beyond their borders. In an attempt to keep America at the forefront of space exploration, former President George W. Bush laid out a plan to develop a new spacecraft, Orion, that would take flight in 2015 and send astronauts to the moon in 2020 in order to build a lunar base. But Obama’s budget undoes this commendable plan and will instead turn astronauts into paying passengers aboard yet-to-be developed commercial vehicles or Russian rockets. Meanwhile, China will be forging ahead in its effort to go to the moon. If we fall behind in this new space race, we will  forfeit our status as the hegemon of exploration and technology.
So why isn’t space exploration higher on the political agenda of the United States? Some argue that we have too many problems to deal with here on Earth to spend money on propelling a few select individuals out of the gravitational hold of our planet. Granted, NASA’s 18-billion-dollar budget is a lot of money, but it accounts for only 0.6 percent of the federal budget. And while it is true that there are many important issues to deal with and many projects that need funding, the scale of NASA’s funding pales in comparison to the 150 billion dollars spent bailing out American International Group, the nearly 130 billion dollars spent bailing out the auto industry, the 663.8 billion dollars allotted for the Defense Department budget, or the 1.58 trillion dollars allotted for social programs. The Department of Health and Human Services spends the equivalent of the annual NASA budget every 7.5 days. Support for NASA is a comparatively small investment with big returns.
Not only have American accomplishments in space instilled in us a sense of national pride, but they have also allowed us to reach across our borders and collaborate with other countries in spite of our diplomatic disputes. By creating an international space program, the U.S. has brought together many countries around the globe to work on a complex engineering project during peacetime. The United States has always been a country of action. In the midst of “change we can believe in,” human space exploration is vital for a country whose course of action isn’t just wishing on stars, but reaching for them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over J-term, in the midst of an acute television binge, I happened upon a trailer insipid enough to jolt me out of my Jersey Shore stupor. The movie in question: The Bounty Hunter, starring Gerald Butler in the eponymous role as a vindictive, muscled man who violently kidnaps his ex-wife with all the sadistic merriment audiences have come to expect from the former King of Sparta. The trailer, in which a stiletto-clad Jennifer Aniston is stuffed in a trunk, handcuffed to a bed, and tackled, has such an air of comic exuberance that one almost expects to hear a laugh track looping in the background. The presumption that these scenes of intra-couple rage will inspire anticipation rather than disgust begs the question: when did violence against women become so trivial—and so hilarious?
In American film, gender-based violence is, unfortunately, business as usual, though it usually assumes a more somber tone. From Hitchcock’s indulgently Freudian Psycho, with its infamous shower slashing, to Demme’s Silence of the Lambs, with its copious shots of bludgeoned women, misogyny and cinema make comfortable, even gleeful, bedfellows. On television, procedural crime dramas such as Law and Order repeatedly render graphic, almost gratuitously gruesome, scenes of brutality against women, which take sadism to creative extremes.
Indeed, in the shared language of the media, battered women double as entertainment. More often than not, the female is figured as a perpetual victim: as the passive, the “done to,” and the “acted upon” rather than the actor. Women cannot represent but are, instead, represented, their subjectivity eroded to the point of death. Seducing the audience with the macabre-made-sexy, such images remain complicit with the stereotypic representations they relate, reinforcing, rather than disrupting, cultural myths of the feminine as immanence and contingency. Replayed again and again, these pictures remain more powerful than their attendant plotlines—so powerful, in fact, that they prove almost impossible to puncture. The pairing of sex and violence, femininity and victimhood, becomes normalized, creating a culture where women die by the dozens in primetime.
According to psychoanalytic film critics, violence is a characteristic trait of photography and cinema, as evident in the very language of “aiming” a camera and “shooting” an image. Enmeshed in the sexual economy of the gaze, vision too exercises a system of control over women’s bodies. Positioning the self against an inassimilable (female) other, the eye serves as an explicit instrument of objectification and mastery. As feminist Luce Irigaray theorizes, the supremacy of looking over all other sensory experiences—hearing, smelling, tasting, touching—has effected an impoverishment of bodily relations. Deflated to the two-dimensional surface—the film, the television screen, the billboard, the magazine advertisement—the female body has lost its material weight: thus abstracted, it has become an object that can be bound, gagged, and raped in virtual reality with near impunity. Viewed within this theoretical frame, media renderings of violence against women enable a particularly potent, and particularly violent, form of voyeurism. Reducing the female body to decayed and decaying flesh, then subjecting it to a distanced gaze, these productions provide an inherently sadistic pleasure.
Case in point: in its eighth season, America’s Next Top Model aired a “crime scene” photo shoot, where each contestant appeared as a supine victim, having been variously electrocuted, decapitated, or stripped of internal organs by a fellow model. The judges received these images, unequivocal in their eroticization of the brutalized female body, with banal one-liners, extolling their elegance, beauty, and “fierceness.” One chastised a contestant for lacking “some sort of spark,” opining “you just gave up and thought that that was being dead,” and correcting all of us who had naively confused being dead with, well…being dead. Eerily akin to Warhol’s “Car Crash” series, these images conflate simulated death with sexiness and transform the morbid into an overt spectacle.
In our culture, where bounty-hunting begets romantic comedies and bloodied female bodies moonlight as erotica, sex and violence remain hopelessly confused. Tellingly, our most emotionally charged verb—“to fuck”—denotes both sexual intercourse and intense hostility. Metaphors of rape pervade our airways, while the dating game is analogized to a vicious “hunt.” Children are socialized to believe that the sexes are at odds: a fact testified to by the timeworn mantra “girls rule, boys drool.” When women win, men must lose, or so the logic goes; hence, feminism necessarily threatens both manhood and manliness. Only when we treat gender-based violence as a crime rather than a spectacle can we accept that sexual relations are not a zero-sum game—and restore our cultural sanity in the process.

Google’s motto has always been “Do no evil.” However, there is a perception in business that “do no evil” translates into “make no profit”—and thus that no corporation would actually prioritize humanitarian ideals over moneymaking. However, Google’s removal of its business from China bucks this contention and reflects what I hope to be a growing trend in business. It behooves us, as consumers and world citizens, to note this trend. Some corporations gross more annually than small countries, and they are thus as important as many nations in the sphere of international relations. Therefore, there exists a real possibility that corporations could be new arbiters for human rights.
In the twentieth century, firms also played a gigantic role in deciding domestic policy and international resolutions. However, these decisions were made not infrequently against benevolent political ideologies. For example, the U.S. government supported the interests of the United Fruit Company in the massacre of Santa Marta in 1928. To promote the interest of the UFC, the U.S. instructed the Colombian president to comply with orders to forcibly increase worker productivity. Such examples abound from Latin America, Africa, and India. But you don’t need a history lesson in colonization.
Google’s move is also praiseworthy because its commodity—information—is especially valuable. While Chinese citizens could live without tangible products, such as Levi jeans or mangos, to deny world citizens ideas is both economically and intellectually deleterious. Our fellow humans—the average person is a Chinese subsistence farmer—must be allowed the freedom of expression. Nothing should prevent world citizens from engaging in active dialogue across borders.
Of course, Google’s moral high ground benefits from the fact that it sells a high-concept unmanufactured product. It may be a little harder for a manufacturing company like Nike to make a similar move, given the fact that many such companies employ low-paid factory workers who earn pennies a day. For example, a 2008 National Labor Committee report called into question the new Sesame Street dolls, which were allegedly made under sweatshop conditions. Just recently, the NLC released a report on the abject conditions in a Reebok sweatshop in San Salvador. According to the report, workers are paid ten cents for each eighty-dollar jersey they make. Unfortunately, the NLC notes that this pay only “amounts to twenty three percent of the basic subsistence need for food, housing, health care, and clothing for an average sized family of four”. In such cases, a move against China’s human rights violations risks coming off as hypocrisy.
Nevertheless, it is the duty of all firms, especially ones who traffic in information, to make strong statements against tyrannical censorship and inequality. Business is now intrinsic to all human creations, from this newspaper to the roads we drive. By cutting funds to information-filtering states corporations send a message unmatched by governments.
Businesses have historically done one thing: business. That Google has even insinuated at moving towards ethical principles over profit is cause for humanity to take a deep breath of rejoice. Unfortunately for Chinese citizens, Google rests low on CNN Money’s Fortune 500 list of America’s largest corporations —a mere 117th. This trend toward ethics over profit needs to continue expanding to bigger economic powerhouses, to reverberate the message throughout the world.
More than sanctions, International Criminal Court threats, or World Bank and United Nations action, today businesses can do the best job of advocating for human rights. In acting on this principle, Google demonstrates its commitment to a fairer world. It has shown that besides selling a highly effective search engine, it can also sell egalitarian ideas.

History of Art and Architecture Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger, a vocal advocate for the primacy of the libraries during a time of financial constraints, will chair a committee to represent faculty interests in the ongoing process to reform the library system.
In November, the office of University Provost Steven E. Hyman released the report of the Task Force on University Libraries, which called for a restructuring of Harvard’s “labyrinthine” library system and charged the eight-member Library Implementation Group—stacked with library and University administrators—with the execution of the report’s recommendations over the coming year.
In contrast, the Faculty Advisory Committee will not create policy, but will instead ensure that the changes proposed by the implementation group align with the priorities of faculty members, according to Hamburger, whose appointment was announced by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith at the Faculty meeting last Tuesday.
As chair of the faculty committee, Hamburger will gather a group of two dozen faculty members, who will meet for the first time within the next couple of weeks.  The membership of the group has not yet been determined, but will draw from across FAS.
Harvard’s library system—currently a sprawling, disjointed structure of 73 separate entities—is “not simply the jewel in [Harvard’s] crown,” Hamburger said.
“It is the crown, and it is in disrepair,” he said. “Our concern might well be that efficiency doesn’t become an excuse for expediency.”
Hamburger, a vocal regular at recent Faculty meetings, said that he hopes to guarantee Harvard’s financial commitment to the library. He said he welcomes the opportunity to represent professors though the workings of the advisory committee, which will serve as a conduit between faculty and the implementation group.
“One always worries about being co-opted,” Hamburger said, acknowledging that the committee will play an indirect role in the implementation of changes related to the library system. “I think the [FAS] dean’s actions are entirely in good faith.”
Divinity School Professor David C. Lamberth, the chair of the implementation group, said he is working with representatives from across the University to execute the administrative recommendations of the task force report. Lamberth is the only professor in the group who does not hold an administrative position in the libraries.
The formation of the faculty advisory committee comes two months after Hamburger and two other humanities professors penned a letter calling for increased library funding.  The missive was endorsed by over 100 colleagues and sent to top administrators, including Hyman, Smith, and University President Drew G. Faust.
A week later, Smith announced that FAS would not make the expected funding cuts for Harvard College Library, the largest unit in the library system.

Acclaimed epidemiologist and co-founder of InteKrin Therapeutics, Inc. Christos S. Mantzoros has been promoted to professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and professor in environmental health at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Mantzoros—a former associate professor in both departments and the clinical research overseer of the division of endocrinology diabetes and metabolism at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center—has garnered acclaim for his work on endocrine-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes.
In 2005, Mantzoros co-founded InteKrin Therapeutics, a biotech company that President and CEO Dennis M. Lanfear said is concerned with developing and commercializing treatments for stage-three diabetes.
Lanfear, who co-founded InteKrin with Mantzoros, praised his business partner and friend as “a great educator and mentor.”
“[Mantzoros] has not only a keen intellect, but also a high standard of personal integrity,” Lanfear said. “He is a solid and loyal friend.”
Florencia Ziemke, a clinical research fellow at BIDMC who has worked with Mantzoros for one and a half years, said that Mantzoros has the ability “to build a family” as a mentor.
“He never raises the tone of his voice, his standards are high—yet he manages to do it in a way where he is constantly teaching and educating us,” Ziemke said. “Mentors are like stars—you don’t always see them, but you know they’re always there.”
Mantzoros, who received his Master’s degree at HMS, has received numerous awards for his work in epidemiology and endocrinology, including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology Frontiers in Science Award and the Novartis Award in Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases.
In addition to numerous academic papers, Mantzoros is the author of two books: “Nutrition and Metabolism: Underlying Mechanisms and Clinical Consequences” and “Obesity and Diabetes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61 will deliver the keynote address at this year’s Commencement on May 27, the University announced yesterday.
Souter, a Rhodes Scholar and 1966 graduate of Harvard Law School, stepped down from the high court in June after nearly two decades of service.
In a statement, University President Drew G. Faust praised the former Lowell House resident’s independence and selflessness on the court.
"The dedication, humility, and commitment to learning with which he has pursued his calling should be an inspiration to any young man or woman contemplating a career in public service," Faust said.
The choice of Souter reflects Faust’s longtime commitment to promoting public service among members of the Harvard community since she ascended the presidency.
While the economic climate has hindered the University’s ability to finance large-scale public service programs, Faust’s recent efforts have been focused on promoting student projects and other opportunities in public service.
In October, Faust announced an initiative supporting students volunteering at the Greater Boston Food Bank, and the Harvard Kennedy School has been working with the White House to improve graduates’ job prospects in Washington.
Though the program has since been suspended, the Law School launched an initiative in 2008 to waive the third year of tuition for students who committed to five years of work in the public service sector.
Noah R. Feldman ’92, a Law School professor who clerked for Souter on the Supreme Court in 1998, also praised Souter’s commitment to public service yesterday, calling him the "the closest thing to a selfless public servant we’ve seen."
"He is a model of what a devoted public servant is in an era that has very few examples of that," Feldman said. "He threw himself into his job and worked 70 hours a week—not because he was a workaholic, but because that’s what his conscience told him he needed to do in order to do his job well."
Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 added that Souter’s Court opinions are well respected in the legal community.
"As a scholar, I always found his contributions to the law admirable, and his manifest concern for the plight of the most vulnerable of our citizens made his a beacon worth following," Tribe wrote in an e-mail. "I’m sure his reflections will prove enlightening at a time of national soul-searching and peril."
Appointed in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush, Souter came to be regarded as a moderate liberal during his 19-year tenure on the federal bench. By the middle of his term, Souter frequently voted with liberals on issues including the death penalty, worker rights, and limits on abortion restrictions.
But according to Feldman, it was not Souter who changed, but the nature of conservatism in the United States.
"It’s not obvious that he changed at all," Feldman said. "The world changed around him—and conservatism changed around him."
Before joining the Supreme Court, Souter served on the New Hampshire Supreme Court and as an Associate Attorney General in the state. He was briefly on the U.S. Court of Appeals before being appointed to the nation’s highest court.
According to media reports when he stepped down, Souter never felt completely comfortable in Washington. He had always preferred his farm in New Hampshire, and his retirement came as a welcome relief from a city from which he had largely grown distant.
Souter—who was replaced on the court by Sonia M. Sotomayor—said at a Constitution Day event last September that he planned to undertake a variety of part-time jobs, such as returning to the First Circuit in Boston, where he spent just one day hearing cases before starting his tenure at the Supreme Court.
Souter follows in a long line of distinguished commencement day speakers that most recently have included Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, author J.K. Rowling, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

CORRECTION: February 25, 2010
Due to an editing error, an original version of the Feb. 9 news article "David H. Souter To Deliver Address at Harvard's 2010 Commencement" stated that former U.S. Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61 retired to his family farmhouse in Weare, N.H. after stepping down from the high court in June. In fact, though Souter was known to frequently return to Weare during his tenure on the court, upon retirement he bought a house in nearby Hopkinton, where he now lives, according to the New York Times.

In a discovery that they say could lead to a better understanding of the causes of metabolic diseases—including obesity and diabetes—Harvard School of Public Health researchers recently found that overconsumption of lipids and other nutrients in mice activates a molecule that triggers the body’s inflammatory response.
Inflammation is the body’s necessary response to foreign pathogens, but chronic inflammation can cause serious tissue damage.
“The important question is, how can a metabolic signal or a nutrient trigger an immune response?” said Gökhan S. Hotamisligil, chair of the HSPH Department of Genetics and Complex Diseases and principal investigator for the study, which was published in the journal Cell on Feb. 5.
The researchers focused on the molecule known as PKR, an enzyme already known to be involved in the immune response against viruses.
After measuring the enzyme levels in the liver and fatty tissues from both lean and obese mice, they found that levels of PKR activation were strongly correlated with the amount of fatty tissue in the mice.
Their study—published in the February 5 issue of the journal Cell—postulates that activation of this enzyme leads to immune system subsequently interfering with metabolic pathways.
The study also shows that PKR directly interferes with normal insulin function in a way that could lead to the onset of type 2 diabetes.
“This discovery...can unify many previous studies related to inflammation and metabolic disease,” Hotamisligil said.
“It also identifies a mechanism of how nutrients can directly engage in such inflammatory response.”
PKR, after being activated by lipids and other nutrients, participates in the clustering of other molecules—creating a complex the researchers termed “metaflammasome”—which in turn leads to chronic inflammation.
The researchers are optimistic that their discovery of this additional function of PKR could lead to a better understanding of metabolic disorders and ultimately, to treatments.
Takahisa Nakamura, the first author of the study and a research fellow at HSPH, calls their work “the first step.”
“We’re very excited to analyze this new concept: that in cells, inflammatory pathways are integrated with metabolism,” Nakamura said.
The study may signal a new direction  in  metabolic disease research, according to James R. Mitchell, an assistant professor at HSPH who has researched the effects of dietary restriction on health in mammals.
“Understanding the specific mechanism of how lipids activate PKR could be the next exciting avenue of discovery,” Mitchell said.

After what was perhaps the longest winter break in the history of Harvard College, administrators are beginning to consider options for the next January Term.
Though the College administration is still evaluating feedback from students and faculty, undergraduates across campus have articulated a desire for increased offerings during next year’s J-Term.
In an interview last week, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said she felt the month-long January break—which she termed "an experiment"—went smoothly. She declined to give a more detailed assessment of the break until she has had an opportunity to review the results of surveys of both faculty and undergraduates regarding their January experiences.
During the interview, Hammonds said she would not rule out the possibility of academic programming during next year’s J-Term.
Some students who stayed on campus this past January expressed a desire for the College to organize J-Term activities, such as classes or social activities.
"Since we’re back on campus, it would be great to be able to take a class and get credit, do something more productive than watching TV," said Caitlin J. Rowland ’12, who stayed on campus to practice for the women’s basketball team and became a self-proclaimed "Glee addict." 
House Tutors were also supportive of increasing on-campus programming during J-Term, though they also stressed the importance of relaxation time for students between busy semesters.
"Let’s present an opportunity to do something that enriches your life but is not academically oriented," said Adams House tutor Matthew J. Corriel ’05.
Adams House Master John G. "Sean" Palfrey ’67 said he hoped that faculty could also be involved in creating J-Term opportunities, including faculty-led projects and seminars.
But student group leaders remain pessimistic about the prospects of College-initiated programming next year.
"It seems unlikely given the time and resources right now," said Undergraduate Council President Johnny F. Bowman ’11. "Everyone is just assuming that we’re not going to have enough [available funds]."
And though Hammonds would not eliminate the option of College-sponsored programming, other administrators said it was unfeasible.
"In this era of budget cuts, I can’t imagine we’re going to build a whole new program on campus," said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 in a Committee on Student Life meeting last week.
In lieu of College-supported programming, many student organizations leaders said they hoped to see an increase in the number of students allowed to stay on campus and participate in student group-initiated programming instead.
Groups such as the Phillips Brooks House Association, which offered a few public service initiatives this past January, the Institute of Politics, and peer advising groups expressed desires to lead their own activities on campus next January.
"I don’t see any argument against [student group-initiated programming]," said Mary K.B. Cox ’10, former president of the IOP Student Advisory Committee. "It wouldn’t cost the university anything except letting people stay in their own rooms and feeding them."

After six weeks of trying to elect a mayor, the Cambridge City Council has narrowed the candidates down to Councillors David P. Maher, Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, and Henrietta J. Davis, with Maher leading the pack with four votes over the past three election sessions.


Reeves, the senior member of the Council, has acted as temporary mayor since January 1, a role that includes chairing the Cambridge School Committee.
Though a final election could have taken place at last night’s City Council meeting, the Councillors took no such action, because Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. was absent.
First-term Councillor Leland Cheung made a recommendation yesterday to check the legality of using a runoff election procedure in this year’s mayoral election to speed up the process. The proposal was unanimously passed.
Maher said an "embarrassing situation" would result if a mayor is not elected at the next City Council meeting on Feb. 22.
Although he did not speak in favor of changing the city’s charter to, he recommended "subtle changes to help the Council to come to a conclusion in a fast, swift, and more urgent way."
Currently, the City Council has accepted Maher’s recommendation to meet every Wednesday—in addition to regular Monday meetings—until a mayor is selected, if a conclusion isn’t reached by Feb. 22. A candidate needs five votes to be named mayor.
"Doing it the way we’ve always done it has served us well in the past," Councillor Craig A. Kelley said. "However, I would like to find out whether [the runoff] is a legal option."
Kelley’s sentiment was shared by other Councillors, including former Mayor E. Denise Simmons, who encouraged the Councillors to discuss other options regarding voting procedures in the future.
Local pundit Robert Winters, who teaches at the Harvard Extension School and heads a blog about Cambridge politics, said that he would prefer that a mayor be elected as soon as possible, but that multiple factors are drawing the election into a stalemate.
"I know there are interpersonal issues between them...I don’t know that that’s the primary reason they can’t resolve things," said Winters, who compared following the mayoral race to watching "daytime soaps, one night a week."
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who called the process of electing a mayor
"time consuming," said that the Boston Globe was unfair to report that Reeves—the former mayor of Cambridge who currently possesses only two votes—was impeding the progress of the election. Yesterday’s Globe article stated that some say Reeves is "holding up the process by not dropping out of the running."
"If you are that frustrated and interested, initiate a charter commission," Decker said.
In response, Reeves said that there are "too many people who don’t understand the system, and some of them are writing about it."
Decker was a candidate for mayor earlier this year, but withdrew from the race. Since then both she and Simmons have announced that they are running in the special election for the Mass. State Senate Seat from which Anthony D. Galluccio resigned in January.

Though a final election could have taken place at last night’s City Council meeting, the Councillors took no such action, because Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. was absent.
First-term Councillor Leland Cheung made a recommendation yesterday to check the legality of using a runoff election procedure in this year’s mayoral election to speed up the process. The proposal was unanimously passed.
Maher said an "embarrassing situation" would result if a mayor is not elected at the next City Council meeting on Feb. 22.
Although he did not speak in favor of changing the city’s charter to, he recommended "subtle changes to help the Council to come to a conclusion in a fast, swift, and more urgent way."
Currently, the City Council has accepted Maher’s recommendation to meet every Wednesday—in addition to regular Monday meetings—until a mayor is selected, if a conclusion isn’t reached by Feb. 22. A candidate needs five votes to be named mayor.
"Doing it the way we’ve always done it has served us well in the past," Councillor Craig A. Kelley said. "However, I would like to find out whether [the runoff] is a legal option."
Kelley’s sentiment was shared by other Councillors, including former Mayor E. Denise Simmons, who encouraged the Councillors to discuss other options regarding voting procedures in the future.
Local pundit Robert Winters, who teaches at the Harvard Extension School and heads a blog about Cambridge politics, said that he would prefer that a mayor be elected as soon as possible, but that multiple factors are drawing the election into a stalemate.
"I know there are interpersonal issues between them...I don’t know that that’s the primary reason they can’t resolve things," said Winters, who compared following the mayoral race to watching "daytime soaps, one night a week."
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who called the process of electing a mayor
"If you are that frustrated and interested, initiate a charter commission," Decker said.
In response, Reeves said that there are "too many people who don’t understand the system, and some of them are writing about it."
Decker was a candidate for mayor earlier this year, but withdrew from the race. Since then both she and Simmons have announced that they are running in the special election for the Mass. State Senate Seat from which Anthony D. Galluccio resigned in January.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The editors of Ralph Ellison’s posthumously published second novel, "Three Days Before the Shooting..." told an audience at the Harvard Bookstore last night that the celebrated author’s unfinished work is not a masterpiece.
Ellison, whose "Invisible Man" won the National Book Award in 1953, spent the next forty years struggling to compose his second novel.
John F. Callahan, a humanities professor at Lewis and Clark College, was friends with Ellison during his lifetime. Ellison’s wife named him literary executor after the author’s death in 1994.
Callahan, along with Adam F. Bradley, an associate professor of English at the University of Colorado-Boulder, spent fourteen years sorting through computer disks and boxes of notes that Ellison compiled over four decades.
In 1999, Callahan published "Juneteenth," a portion of the second half of "Three Days Before the Shooting..." to mixed reviews.
Callahan described Ellison’s work as a "fragment" that needed to be edited. During the editing process for this book, some of the author’s notes were given "more weight and heft" to create the narrative of the story, Callahan said.
Bradley, who was 19 when he began working on the project, described his "shock" at seeing typos and "rough sentences that needed honing" while sifting through Ellison’s notes. Despite the notes’ roughness, the editors said it was clear that Ellison was experimenting with the possibilities and variations of language.
This experimentation is reflected in the novel, and Callahan hopes that the book will "fill out the picture" of Ellison.
"Three Days Before the Shooting..." tells the story of a young man of ambiguous race named Bliss who is raised by a black preacher and as an adult becomes a white, race-baiting United States Senator named Adam Sunraider.
The editors said that the novel, despite and because of it’s unfinished state, can function as a window into the literary master’s mind. Callahan said he hopes the work will humanize Ellison. Instead of being seen as a self-critical perfectionist, it is Callahan’s wish that Ellison be seen as a good-humored man who loved dogs and children and had a "defiant imagination."
Glenda R. Carpio, professor of African and African American Studies and English, moderated the discussion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard undergraduate was hit by a moving truck near the intersection of Mt. Auburn Street and Dunster Street yesterday at approximately 4:30 p.m.
The victim, a sophomore resident of Kirkland House, was walking across Mt. Auburn Street toward Finale Desserterie and Bakery, when a silver Ford F-250 traveling along Dunster Street made a quick left turn onto Mt. Auburn Street and collided into the walking student, according to Elizabeth Tang ’11, who witnessed the incident.
The driver of the truck did not stop before making the turn, and a car was parked near the intersection, against the curb in front of Finale, according to Tang.
Tang, who said she saw that the victim was bleeding from the back of her head, called the police immediately. The victim remained conscious the entire time and even called her blockmates to let them know of the incident, according to Tang.
An ambulance arrived, and paramedics placed the victim onto a stretcher, according to Tang, who said she does not know where the individual was taken.
The victim was brought to a family friend’s house later in the day, according to her roommate.
She’s a very serious, very keen student who is very much appreciated and valued in Kirkland House,” said Tom Conley, Master of Kirkland House. He confirmed that the victim is still able to walk after the accident.
“We’re very worried about this,” Conley added, noting that Kirkland is located near several one-way streets, which might endanger pedestrians.
Tang said she later e-mailed the victim, who told Tang that she would “be okay” in 10 days.
“I hope she feels better really soon,” Tang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—For all the hoopla surrounding the annual Beanpot tournament, the one thing that often gets overlooked is just how difficult it is to play for third place.
Last night in a nearly-empty TD Garden, the Harvard men’s hockey team (6-14-3, 6-7-3 ECAC) met Northeastern (13-12-1, 8-10-1 Hockey East) in the consolation game of the 58th Beanpot, falling, 4-1, in a contest that lacked energy and spirit.
“You’re going after the afterglow of the Monday night game, with its big crowd and a lot of energy,” Huskies coach Greg Cronin said. “It’s tough for both teams to go out in a big arena like this when there’s nobody in it.”
Playing its third game in four nights, the Crimson started the game slow and never quite found its spark.
Harvard was given a series of gifts early on, as Northeastern was called for three penalties in the first period—including back-to-back penalties to Chris Donovan and Mike Hewkin to give the Crimson 86 seconds of 5-on-3 play.
But Harvard failed to capitalize, generating just one shot in its three first-period power-play chances.
Instead, it was the Huskies who got on the board first, striking with seconds remaining on Hewkin’s hitting-from-behind penalty.
Northeastern captain Tyler McNeely took a pass from freshman Jake Newton and got Crimson junior blueliner Chris Huxley one-on-one on the left boards. McNeely shook Huxley to streak towards the net alone, beating junior goaltender Ryan Carroll to light the lamp at 17:53.
“I picked up the puck, and I think the defenseman thought I was slowing down to make a move,” McNeely explained. “I just tried to pull it wide and pull it around the goalie and put it far side.”
A minute after McNeely’s tally, Harvard senior Ian Tallett drew an interference penalty that extended to the beginning of the second frame.
“I thought we started the game a little bit flat—put ourselves in some tough situations penalty-wise,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91.
Although the Huskies could not capitalize on the power play, just a few seconds later, Drew Daniels got the puck from J.P. Maley and fired a laser from the blue line. Carroll made the initial save, but assistant captain Greg Costa picked up the rebound, brought it out to the right side of the net, and backhanded it into the cage.
For the rest of the period, Harvard would come together to play its best hockey of the night.
Costa and Crimson sophomore Alex Killorn were boxed for back-to-back penalties, and in the 4-on-4 situation, Harvard found the room to create a chance.
Immediately following a faceoff, senior defender Chad Morin received the puck on the blue line. He crossed it to sophomore Ryan Grimshaw at the left point, and the blueliner let a long shot fly.
Freshman Conor Morrison was standing by the left post to redirect the puck into the net and cut Northeastern’s lead in half, 2-1.
Harvard outshot the Huskies in the second frame by a 15-9 count, but the momentum gathered in the period wasn’t sustained through intermission.
“In the third period, it was a combination of Northeastern wearing us down and us running out of gas,” Donato said. “Give Northeastern a lot of credit, but for us, the bench got too short, too soon.”
Harvard’s weariness started to show early in the period, when freshman David Valek was whistled for hitting from behind. A minute into the ensuing power play, the Huskies bumped their advantage up to two.
Northeastern freshman Garrett Vermeersch wound up for a hard slapshot from the blue line that was deflected in by junior Wade MacLeod. Kyle Kraemer had the secondary assist.
“I thought we were a little sloppy early, but I like the way we played the third period,” Cronin said.
After MacLeod’s tally, the Huskies controlled the game, peppering Carroll with pucks. The junior netminder stood up to the pressure, making a series of split saves and a beauty of a glove nab on a on a wide-open McNeely shot.
Donato pulled Carroll, who finished with 30 saves, from the net with just under two minutes to play, and it didn’t take long for Northeastern to take advantage.
MacLeod got the puck just inside the blue line and rifled a shot that found nothing but the empty net.
“I think it was fortunate that we had a lot of energy in the third period, and we were obviously reinforced by our goaltending,” Cronin said.
Husky rookie Chris Rawlings stood up exceedingly well to the pressure of his first Beanpot tournament, allowing just three goals on 63 shots between last night’s game and last Monday’s 2-1 loss to Boston University.
But for Harvard, the loss simply sends the tired squad back to the drawing board as it prepares for the home stretch of the regular season.
“Obviously, we’re disappointed,” Donato said. “[We’ve played] a lot of hockey over the last four or five days, and I think it kind of caught up with us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This time last year, the Harvard women’s hockey team fell in a 1-0 heartbreaker to Boston College in the Beanpot final, failing to defend its 2008 tournament title. The loss sparked a fire in this year’s Crimson, which hopes to reclaim the Beanpot crown tonight at 8 p.m. at Bright Hockey Center.
Standing in the way of No. 5 Harvard (15-5-4, 11-5-2 ECAC) will be No. 9 Northeastern (16-6-5, 8-5-4-3 Hockey East), the all-time Beanpot title leader with 14 wins.
“We’re expecting [the Huskies] to come out hard,” said junior forward Liza Ryabkina, who netted four goals in last Tuesday’s Beanpot semifinal. “But we want this Beanpot more than ever, especially after last year’s upset.”
The Crimson reached the finals of this year’s Beanpot after a first-round 5-0 blowout over the Eagles. A win tonight would give Harvard its 13th Beanpot title ever and extend its five-game winning streak.
The Crimson is currently ranked fifth in the nation, despite losing senior goaltender Christina Kessler to injury three weeks ago.
“It’s all about the kids believing in each other and getting better every week…Our kids are working hard,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said.
Stone emphasized the importance of enjoying the sport of hockey, and the Crimson appears to be doing just that—having fun and winning games, as the team continues its season without missing a beat.
Veteran leadership has anchored young talent this season, allowing the team to maintain its high level of play despite Kessler’s injury.
The Harvard defense, led by co-captains Cori Bassett and Kathryn Farni, has stepped up to the challenge, complementing strong performances in goal by freshman goaltender Laura Bellamy—who is currently ranked first in the ECAC in goals-against average.
“We have tightened up in the defensive zone [and] we don’t allow very many shots,” junior forward Kate Buesser said. “We’re very aggressive on the player with the puck.”
Another key factor in the team’s recent success has been its turnaround on power plays, as Harvard scored three power-play goals in its 4-3 victory over Yale on Saturday.
“We’ve been moving the puck pretty well,” said Buesser of her team’s play with a man-up advantage. “Throughout the season, we’ve had a lot of opportunities on rebounds but never took them home [until recently].”
Harvard boasts an exceptionally balanced offense this season as well.
Fourteen different players have scored for the Crimson, with 10 of those 14 claiming at least four goals each. Junior Leanna Coskren has scored three game-winning goals, while nine different players have scored at least one game-winner.
Northeastern is a force to be reckoned with in its own right. Ranked nationally just behind Harvard, the Huskies narrowly beat Boston University last Tuesday in their first-round Beanpot matchup. After relinquishing a four-goal lead during regulation, Norheastern was able to pull through in the shootout, 2-0.
Although Harvard and Northeastern have not met since the Crimson bested the Huskies, 3-1, in the 2008 Beanpot opener, the two teams have played a similar schedule. Northeastern comes into tonight’s game after Saturday’s tough 2-1 loss to Providence, a team that Harvard beat by the same score on Jan. 30. But the Crimson can’t be too confident against its top-ten opponent.
“Just play our game,” Stone said of the game plan. “Play consistent, Harvard hockey, keep things simple.”
The Crimson views this game as both a key contest and an opportunity to prepare for the upcoming ECAC tournament.
“It’s a big game on a schedule of big games…We try to approach every game the same way,” Stone said.
While Harvard is making sure not to look beyond tonight’s game, the Beanpot provides a unique opportunity for the Crimson to play in high-stakes contests before the ECAC tournament commences.
“[The Beanpot is] a mini-tournament where every game matters,” Ryabkina said. “It’s good experience, especially for the freshmen, to see how it is to play that sort of game…This will really give us a push to understand how much every game matters. Everyone’s excited to play and win this game.”

Once known for the strength of its special teams, the Harvard men’s hockey team was not-so-special in last night’s 4-1 loss against Northeastern in the consolation round of the Beanpot Tournament at TD Garden.
Although the Crimson had six man-advantage opportunities, including 86 seconds of 5-on-3 play, Harvard failed to score on any one of its chances, and only managed to tally three shots during twice as many power-play moments.
“I don’t think we were sharp on the power play, and at times we looked disorganized in what we were trying to do,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “ We certainly were able to get the puck in control, but weren’t able to get the shots and get traffic and second and third opportunities.”
Northeastern, on the other hand, scored both a power-play goal and a shorthanded goal in its 4-1 thumping of the Crimson.
Called for back-to-back penalties with under five minutes left in the first period, Northeastern gave Harvard nearly a minute and a half of 5-on-3 play.
It would seem that the Crimson had a clear upper hand, but the squad only got one shot on net—a slapshot from the top of the right circle by sophomore Michael Biega—before the Huskies went on a clearing spree, sending the puck past the blue line three times to kill the first penalty.
Still holding a 5-on-4 man-advantage, Harvard’s special teams tried to establish its forecheck, but Northeastern winger Tyler McNeely picked up another clear, skated up the left boards and centered himself for a shorthanded goal, giving the Huskies a 1-0 lead over the Crimson.
“We had taken one penalty after another, back-to-back, to give them a 5-on-3, and obviously that’s not how you want to start a first period against any team, but Tyler’s goal was big,” Northeastern coach Greg Cronin said. “I mean, those shorthanded goals are bonus points, and I thought our team responded really well after that.,,Tonight, we were a little sluggish, but that goal obviously woke us up a bit. We got a little sloppy in the second, but that goal was a big goal.”
Despite Harvard’s additional opportunities, the Crimson’s special teams couldn’t capitalize on a single power play goal—nor could it stave off the Huskies, whose Wade MacLeod scored a third-period goal during another man-advantage play, boosting Northeastern’s lead to 3-1.
The Huskies’ goaltending was a big factor in Harvard’s power-play shutout. Northeastern netminder Chris Rawlings made 27 saves overall, and kept the puck close in those stops to limit the Crimson’s rebound attempts.
“We just didn’t move the puck and weren’t able to get shots through, but when we were, I thought Rawlings was solid,” Donato said. “He didn’t give us a lot of second and third chances.”
“The penalty kill has been terrific since [Rawlings] has been playing well, and usually the penalty kill runs through the goaltender,” Cronin added.
But Rawlings’ strength alone cannot explain Harvard’s struggle on the power play, as last night’s poor performance on special teams was not a one-time occurrence, but, rather, continued a season-long slump.
The Crimson currently holds a .175 conversion rate on the man-advantage, compared with the .226 average conversion rate of its opponents.
On top of that, Harvard’s combined special teams percentage (.418), which takes into account penalty kills and power play goals, is at the bottom of the Ivy League.
Compared to its historical strength on both sides of the power play—the Crimson was ranked second in the Ivies for the last two seasons, with combined special teams percentages of .544 in ’07-’08, and .552 in ’08-’09—Harvard’s current performance on special teams is dramatically sub-par.
That’s not to say that the Crimson hasn’t had its moments. Last Friday, Harvard killed 10 of 11 penalties and knocked in three power-play goals in its 5-2 victory against Brown.
But overall, the Crimson’s special teams has been lackluster. With a failure to capitalize on power-play chances and inconsistency on the penalty kill, it comes as no surprise that Harvard’s third-period rally was not enough to overtake the Huskies, leaving the Crimson in last place amongst its neighborhood rivals.

A couple days ago, the New York Times reported that the student body at the University  of North Carolina was 60 percent female. That leads us to ask this question: how would life at Harvard change if we had a 60-40 split?
At UNC, quite a few of those women are complaining about the lack of available men, but W. Keith Campbell, a psychology professor at the University of Georgia, said that there’s more to the story than immediate romance. Women on campus “are paying a social price for success” and thus face victimization.
Rest assured, Harvard women, that for the time being, such a ratio does not exist here. According to statistics released by the Provost’s Office, there were 3,373 women at the College in October, outnumbering men by only 91—far from a 60-40 divide.
But if Harvard ladies did have a supermajority, what would that do to campus social life? Well, the obvious transformation of Fox to Vixen, Phoenix S.K. to Flamingo, could leave the women, and not the men, waiting outside for admission on some cold Friday evening in February. Such a disparity, though, could make it far easier for the guys interested in the ladies to find someone to take to the next House formal.
Then, there’s Harvard’s recent fascination with speed-dating. While we have feared running into "a giant room full of white guys with yellow fever" at past speed-dating events, we may end up seeing more sponsored by the Radcliffe Union of Students.
Of course, there’s primal scream, which in the past has always been male-heavy. Who are we kidding? Nothing would change there.

You know how other Ivy League  schools have intensive freshman humanities programs designed to teach the respective skills of suffocating pretension and talking out of your ass? Yeah. Well, apparently, students at these places  are starting to realize that these breeding grounds of eternal douchebaggery  might not be so worth it after all. At Princeton, nearly half  of all freshmen enrolled in HUM 216-219, the year-long, four-course  freshman humanities sequence, have dropped it. According to The Daily  Princetonian,  43 freshmen enrolled at the beginning of last semester, but only 26  are still registered for the course. The reasons? Most students, according  to The Princetonian, are frustrated with the course’s "pace," with one student even complaining that some of her compatriots "actually  liked the material so much that they couldn’t stand going over Aristotle  in a day." If we found ourselves trapped in a rural New Jersey hamlet with absolutely nothing else to do, we too would want more time  to hear ourselves talk about books we spent fifteen minutes reading  about on Wikipedia.
A new book by Jonathan R. Cole, The Great American  University,  refers to the University of Chicago as "our closest approximation  to the idea of a great university." Hmm. Cole  also traces the history of modern American higher education back to the founding  of Johns Hopkins in 1876—not to 1636, which everyone knows is the year when the world officially  began spinning on its axis.
Over in Palo Alto, the Stanford Student Government has been circulating a little e-flyer about "Wellness Week," whose theme, conceived with utmost originality, is "Finding Balance and Happiness." Why? Because,  you know, that’s what one does in California. Find balance and happiness.  But the best part of this otherwise eye-roll inducing event is  the central  image on the flier—sea  lions! Really! Don’t they look relaxed?
Down in Philadelphia,  Penn recently announced that the papers of Chaim Potok, the  great Jewish-American novelist who wrote such favorites as The Chosen  and My Name is Asher Lev, are now all ready. Potok, a Penn alum,  left his papers to the University after his death in 2002, according to The New York Times.
Speaking of The Times, it turns out that Yale may lose their free copies of the Gray Lady in dining halls. An op-ed columnist in The Yale Daily News opined about the potential loss, saying that the newspaper serves to "create well informed, broadly informed citizens." We, though, agree with the sentiment of HPRgument: "I can’t see why it should dumb down the Yalies—well, actually…"

A female student was hit by a truck near the intersection of Mt. Auburn Street and Dunster Street yesterday at around 4:30 p.m.
The victim, a sophomore resident of Kirkland House, was walking across Mt. Auburn Street toward Finale Desserterie and Bakery when a truck traveling on Dunster Street turned left onto Mt. Auburn Street at a quick speed, according to Elizabeth Tang '11, a witness. The driver hit the student, who fell to the ground.
The victim was then taken from the scene by paramedics. Kirkland House Master Tom Conley told The Crimson that she was eventually brought home by her mother.
Though the victim was bleeding at the scene of the incident, she later told Tang via e-mail that she would recover in 10 days.

Just in case you need some time away from your first problem set (or that paper that was assigned way too early), here are some good distractions for an important cause.
IN THE COLLEGE
Memorial Church is hosting a memorial service for the loved ones of students and employees of Harvard University this Thursday at 2 p.m. While probably one of the more sobering events this week, make sure to come and show solidarity with those that study and work around us.
Sanders Theatre is hosting a benefit concert from 7-9 p.m. this Friday featuring violinist Ryu Goto '11, pianist Charlie Albright ’11, jazz pianist Malcolm G. Campbell ’10, dancer Merritt A. Moore ’11, the Kuumba Singers, the Harvard Glee Club, the Harvard Caribbean Dance Team, and the Modern Dance Company. Tickets are $10 for students ($25 for adults) and can be purchased through the Harvard Box Office.
If you can't make any of this week's events, don't fret: Harvard Hillel is accepting pre-orders for the "Challah for Haiti," and you can still show your House pride by donating to earthquake relief efforts on the Harvard for Haiti site. Also, several Harvard organizations are sponsoring a drive to sell roses and donate proceeds to Haiti relief. Orders can be placed here.
IN THE SQUARE
Club Passim is holding a relief benefit concert at 7 p.m. Tuesday featuring folk artists. Donations will be collected through concert and raffle ticket sales. For more details or to purchase tickets, click here.
IN THE GRAD SCHOOLS
Harvard School of Public Health is hosting a "global chat" from 12:30-1:30 p.m. Wednesday with Stephanie Rosborough in the F.X. Bagnoud Building, room G-11. Rosborough, an instructor at the Harvard Medical School, is the director of the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at Brigham and Women's Hospital. If you're afraid of missing out on lunch from the dining hall, note that "a light lunch is provided."
Harvard Kennedy School presents “A UNHCR Perspective on the International Response to Haiti: Challenges of Coordination and Outlooks on Future Cooperation" on Wednesday from 4-6 p.m. in the Carr Center Conference Room. You'll get to hear from the director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, the director of the University Committee on Human Rights Studies, and a representative from the U.N. Refugee Agency.
Office for the Arts at Harvard presents "Poets for Haiti" on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Askwith Lecture Hall at Radcliffe Quad. With a suggested donation of $10, this is a great way to help Haiti, support the arts at Harvard, and finally sneak a peek at Robert Pinsky!
Harvard Medical School presents "Talks@12: Paul Farmer Leads a Panel Discussion on Haiti" this Thursday from 12-1 p.m. in the Joseph B. Martin Conference Center at the New Research Building. Professor Paul Farmer is the co-founder of Partners in Health and the Deputy UN Special Envoy for Haiti. In case you have class (or can't schlep all the way to the Longwood Campus), a recording of the event will be available here.
