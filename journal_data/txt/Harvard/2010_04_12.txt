After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was half past five in the morning on Saturday, when Krzysztof M. Kozak ’10 was woken up by a call from his mother in Warsaw.
The Polish president had been killed in a plane crash, his mother told him, asking him to check the news.
For many Polish undergraduates like Kozak, the deaths of Polish President Lech Kaczynski and top political and military leaders in a plane crash in western Russia over the weekend came as a shock.
“Imagine, you know, having [President] Obama, Michelle Obama,...and the governor of the central bank...die at the same moment,” said Dominik Nieszporowski ’12. “It was an incredible tragedy.”
The deaths are even more shocking in light of the historical context, Nieszporowski added. In 1940, Stalin ordered a massacre of more than 20,000 Polish officials and intellectuals in Russia. Seventy years later, President Kacynski and 96 others—including many top Polish officials—died in the same location while en route to commemorate the massacre’s 70th anniversary.
The crash has led to unprecedented unity among Polish students on campus, said Jakub Dolecki ’11. Members of the Harvard Polish Society planned commemoration events over the weekend, and many Polish students at Harvard had planned to attend a Catholic Mass at a Polish church in southern Boston last night, Dolecki said.
The Polish Society will also hold a meeting this Friday, which will coincide with the end of official national mourning in Poland.
Other Polish students in the area expressed grief through activism. Two MIT freshmen organized a screening of a film detailing the 1940 massacre for students at MIT and Harvard on Saturday night. The same night, Kozak said he and his friends put up a small Polish flag on the wall of University Hall, but it was taken down the following morning.
He added that the Polish Society is currently negotiating with the Office of the University Marshal to hang a Polish flag with a black ribbon on the flag pole adjacent to the John Harvard statue.
Kozak said that he also planned to light candles in front of the plaques of two Polish heroes in Cambridge Common.
Despite their grief, most Polish students showed optimism about both Poland’s domestic stability and the country’s ability to recover from the tragedy.
“Poland has encountered many challenges in the past few centuries,” Dolecki said, “and we always recovered.”
Although many top leaders were killed, Nieszporowski said he believedsthe national tragedy will not spawn a political or economic crisis.
According to Kozak, it is “amazing” that Russian leaders have shown a “fast” and “caring” response, which has challenged pessimism about the fragile relationship between Poland and Russia, he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of all of the changes to American society due to outsourcing, one in particular has recently raised eyebrows: the delegation of paper grading at some colleges to companies that work in India and Malaysia. This particularly worrisome trend received media attention when the practice was adopted in a University of Houston class, and brings up concerns about the quality of contact that students are receiving in large classes.
In this particular case, a company called EduMentry that hires workers in India, Malaysia and Singapore provided a service called Virtual TA, which grades papers for large classes that lack enough teaching assistants. Outsourcing in this manner takes away from the education that students are receiving, as there is considerable value in having teaching assistants who experience the class and then evaluate students accordingly. This allows the graders to take into account dynamics in the course that otherwise would be missed by an international firm. Furthermore, outsourced grading strictly limits the range and scope of the papers being considered. Companies that grade papers remotely likely rely on an outline from the professor, listing points that should be covered in the assignment. Papers should be graded with a more holistic view, to encourage a diversity of ideas that simply cannot be expressed when attempting to follow a fixed outline.
Additionally, it is worthwhile for students to have an opportunity to communicate directly with the people who are evaluating their work. Although office hours with a teaching assistant would be ideal, given the understandable constraints of tight budgets, even having the option to email evaluators with questions is worthwhile and preferable to a complete lack of contact. Although large classes are often the norm at some universities, schools should never overextend enrollment of classes to the point where they do not have the adequate resources—both physical and human—to accommodate all of the students.
In addition to the general concerns about this trend in outsourcing, we have further doubts about the specific firm used by the University of Houston professor in question. While the company, based in Virginia, asserts that all of its “assessors,” or graders, hold master’s degrees and must pass written exams before they are employed, it refused to give specific information on the graders’ educational backgrounds. The firm insists that “the proof is in the pudding” when it comes to the success of their assessors. Yet, this lack of transparency is troubling, especially considering the already anonymous and impersonal nature of such outsourcing. If firms like this are interested in working with American universities on tasks as crucial as grading student work, they should be more forthcoming about the qualifications of their employees.

“Never again should a people starve in a world of plenty.” This is the inscription on the little-noticed memorial to the Irish Potato Famine in Cambridge Common. Although the tragedy was over 150 years ago, its legacy is with us to this day. Though we do not know great famine in this country, we know homelessness, abject poverty, and the misery and suffering which accompany them. In this country and in this city, people still feel the aches of hunger, want, and fear. To change this course of poverty and homelessness we must first, as a society, change how we view these people and acknowledge the moral duty that compels each of us to serve within the Cambridge community.
It is not hard to find homeless men and women in Cambridge, as most Harvard students can attest. They sleep in front of the Coop and in Cambridge Common. They dot the stretch of Mass. Ave. in front of the yard and crowd Harvard Square. To some extent, the presence of homelessness and poverty in Cambridge is a far more jarring realization than elsewhere. Quite literally in the shadows of the world’s richest and most reputable university, human beings go hungry and live on the streets.
This stark contrast should serve as a call-to-action for all Harvard students. These men and women are a constant reminder of where we as a society have failed, and so we choose to look away. We all do. When an elderly man asks us for change outside CVS or Uno’s, we pretend not to hear, or stare blankly into space while quickly moving on our way. However, becoming habituated to homelessness is not strong; it is callous. This is not to say that we are obligated to give money to the homeless on a daily basis, but we must not pretend as if they do not even exist or are somehow less than human. The social stigma against being anything less than blasé about Harvard Square homelessness must be addressed.
Many answer this call by participating in one or more of Harvard’s myriad community service programs. Others volunteer and serve in less formal but equally meaningful ways. Community outreach and service, though, is something that all, and not just most, students should play a part in. The next time you get an email from your House e-mail list promoting a community outreach and service event, give it some actual thought before routinely purging it from your inbox. Choose to volunteer on a shift with the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, go on a building day with Habitat for Humanity, or help distribute meals to impoverished Cambridge families. These are just some of many ways to give back and better the situations of the homeless and poorer residents with whom Harvard shares the city of Cambridge.
Most importantly, when looking at homeless men and women around the Square and throughout Cambridge, see them as people too. As students it may seem that we can have no impact on the crushing epidemic of homelessness and poverty, but volunteering matters, changing our attitudes toward those who are less fortunate matters, and acknowledging our duty to give back to the Cambridge community matters. Many, hopefully all, of us want to alleviate suffering in the world during the course of our lifetimes—and in this vein it would be hypocritical not to try and alleviate suffering in our college community during the course of our four years here. Even in the midst of great economic trials, we must all strive to move society closer to a day when the inscription on the Common memorial can be taken in truth, and people will never again starve, suffer, or want in a world of plenty.

Harvard prides itself on a vast and generous financial aid program. According to Harvard College’s Financial Aid Office, Harvard “[awards] a record-breaking $145 million in need-based scholarship assistance to almost 60 percent of our students.” Sounds pretty good, right? An all-encompassing financial aid package awarded to every student who demonstrates financial need. Wrong. Like many other exalted institutions, Harvard only offers the illusion of financial security. In fact, Harvard is discriminating against the most vulnerable members of its community: The mentally ill.
While Harvard has an unprecedented financial aid program that has allowed many students to flourish, Harvard oppresses the mentally ill who are characterized by a lower socioeconomic status.
Being mentally ill makes it very difficult to excel in the United States, and Harvard is no exception. When a student enters Harvard with a mental disability, he or she is required to submit documentation to prove their illness. While some colleges will accept several forms of documentation, Harvard requires the student to present evidence of a neuropsychological examination from a neuropsychologist with a Ph.D. Nothing else is acceptable, not even documentation from a treating psychiatrist (M.D.) that states the illness and lays out the issues that require that a student receive various educational supports.
While Harvard may offer the financial aid for students to step foot in their dorms, Harvard does not offer that same support to students with mental disabilities. That is to say, Harvard does not support its students in the financial sense because Harvard requires its students to submit expensive and unreasonable evidence to “prove” their mental illness so the student can receive reasonable accommodations.
These accommodations help the student perform better overall because the mental disabilities they face can cause insurmountable barriers to success. A voiceless mentally ill population is exploited in America. With nigh zero mention of mental illness in the current health care debate because mental health issues are the elephant in the room when discussing health care, the voiceless are being pushed aside for big interests to see their agenda through the health reform bill. We can see similar practices on a smaller scale at Harvard.
Harvard’s discrimination when it comes to mental illness and disability services is a problem of paramount importance that affects many.  The National Institute of Mental Health claims 26.2 percent of American adults—57.7 million people—suffer from a mental illness each year. Harvard cannot overlook this inconvenient truth—many of its students have mental illness that requires specific supports for the student to succeed in an academic environment. I am one such student—diagnosed with mental illness, including anxiety and ADHD, I have trouble concentrating in class as well as during exams. The simple act of someone coughing can send my mind into the abyss, causing myself to lose focus for an indefinite amount of time.
For me—and others dealing with mental illness—the ability to take an exam in a separate and contained environment while receiving extended time on exams is essential to my success here. According to Harvard, because I do not have incredibly expensive documentation from a neuropsychologist with a Ph.D., I am unable to receive these necessary accommodations afforded to people with disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The chance for a student to attend Harvard could be quashed when she discovers that the testing that Harvard requires is too expensive for the family. Harvard has a choice—it can either accept a broader range of documentation or pay for the costly documentation. Right now, it does neither and students like me are in danger of going unnoticed.
If students like myself are going to make it here, Harvard needs to put in place a more supportive and flexible system. By requiring students to submit a neuropsychological examination from—what Harvard deems as the only appropriate source—a Ph.D. neuropsychologist, they force an undue financial hardship upon a majority of students. An institution like Harvard should be part of the solution, not part of the problem. It should be working overtime to support students with mental illness. Harvard’s “complete” package is not just incomplete but rather bland when a student realizes they cannot afford to go to Harvard—or get sick—because Harvard does not really support them. No student should be forced to choose between their health and an education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For those of you living under a rock, Apple released its newest gadget, the iPad, earlier this month. Like most Apple launches of the 21st century, the product has generated a thousand articles in the mainstream press and a thousand and one different opinions. So far, the iPad has been maligned as a sinister threat to creativity, praised as an agent of convenience, and enshrined as a brilliant business plan because it doesn’t threaten Apple’s market share in either laptops or phones. Rather than any of these things, however, the iPad should be recognized as the first product that makes the screen its central focus.
Whereas a regular laptop is a computer that happens to have a screen attached, the iPad is a sophisticated touchscreen that just happens to have a computer behind it. In most laptops, peripherals such as audio and display are subservient to the microprocessor and the central motherboard. By contrast, the iPad’s most expensive components are its display and the touchscreen. Apple’s design philosophy has shaped the iPad into a device with the principal goal of presenting media as simply as possible. Users don’t have to deal with customization, file structures, or installation. The screen, like a window into the world of data, is all you need.
The screen has come a long way to reach its status as a stand-alone device, and it has seen many permutations along the way. For instance, while we take for granted that a screen displays images as grids of pixels, many early computers used oscilloscopes to produce vector graphics, composed of lines and simple shapes, rather than a two-dimensional raster. One of the first videogames, SPACEWAR!, used an oscilloscope to draw its vector graphics in 1962. The popular arcade game Battlezone (1980) used vector graphics to draw a three-dimensional wireframe display, and vector graphics can be still seen today in laser light shows.
However, raster-based graphics, such as the Cathode Ray Tube technology used for TV screens, became the dominant style of computer monitors by the 1980s. They used an electron gun positioned by magnetic fields to scan the front of the tube. Colors were generated with three different guns—one for each primary color—at varying intensities across the screen. But CRTs required a large, deep glass envelope, making them bulky and hard to transport. It took the ability to cheaply develop flat-panel displays—from LCDs in digital clocks to plasma display TVs—to take screens out of the home or office and into the world at large.
Though the iPad represents a watershed moment for the screen, display technology continues to grow and change. While screens are bound to spread further in the near future, it will be hard to predict which features will be emphasized. For years, the best screens had the highest resolution—that is, they crammed the most pixels into every square inch. But despite the popularity of successively larger resolutions in home entertainment, as seen by the success of Blu-Ray disks, resolution isn’t everything. The iPad, which has a larger screen, actually has a lower resolution than the iPhone. Moreover, many people don’t mind the blocky, highly compressed videos off of YouTube, so low resolution is perfectly adequate for viewing short video clips. And the surprising success of Amazon’s e-reader Kindle suggests that for some screen-centric devices, you don’t even need color to woo consumers.
In addition, it is still unclear whether touchscreens will replace more conventional input devices. For applications where precision is critical, a mouse will win out over a touchscreen, no matter how small someone’s fingers are. Even when accuracy isn’t crucial, the finer control a mouse can provide helps users perform actions more quickly, which translates into greater productivity. However, future generations of touchscreens and applications designed to run on them will likely use artificial intelligence to decipher a user’s intentions, which means even users with fat, stubby fingers won’t need a mouse to click on hyperlinks.
Another feature that devices like mouses, keyboards and game controllers have over touchscreens is that their buttons provide tactile and aural feedback to users, though that advantage is quickly eroding. The newest generation of phones uses screens that move back and forth with a motor in response to user input, and future iterations will use piezoelectric elements to trick our fingers into thinking they are interacting with a real keyboard.
More recent areas of screen research point to even more outlandish uses. Organic LEDs, which have been made into televisions in the past few years, use organic materials to emit without a backlight, and they can be printed onto paper or even fabric. Other research into electronic paper has produced flexible screens that can be rolled up into a scroll. Even as screens become more and more ubiquitous, the very definition of what constitutes a screen is changing. Hopefully the screens of tomorrow will inspire us to be more creative, or at least bring us media that teaches and moves us. If nothing else, the future will be full of shiny, animated objects waiting for us to interact with them.

Coming off a three-game winning streak and heading on its biggest road trip of the season, the Harvard men’s volleyball team had set itself up to make a run at a division title. But as the team went for the kill against two key divisional opponents, it came out flat.
The Crimson (5-12, 3-3 EIVA Hay) was swept by Rutgers-Newark (12-11, 7-0) Friday night and was outlasted in five sets by NYU (5-16, 1-6) Saturday afternoon in a pair of losses that could potentially cripple the squad’s playoff chances with just two games remaining in the regular season.
With Friday’s win, the Scarlet Raiders clinched first place in the Hay Division of the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association, in which only two teams from the division make the playoffs. The losses dropped Harvard into third place in the Hay, behind Rutgers-Newark and Sacred Heart—which will visit Cambridge next weekend.
“It’s always tough to come off a weekend of matches and come out with no wins,” co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “So it’s a little unsettling and a little tough to deal with.”
NYU 3, HARVARD 2
In an exciting match Saturday afternoon with 45 ties and 14 lead changes, Harvard was unable to hold off the Violets, falling, 27-30, 30-25, 23-30, 38-36, 15-11, at the Coles Sports Center.
A thrilling fourth set saw 24 ties and eight lead changes alone. In the fifth set, Harvard rallied back from a three-point deficit to even things up at 6-6, but the persistent Violets were able to take advantage of Crimson attack errors to hold on for its first Hay Division victory of the season.
“It was a pretty big heartbreaker,” senior Soren Rosier said. “That’s a team I think we should beat, and we had some opportunities to beat them. We just didn’t take advantage.”
Four NYU players finished with double-digit kills, led by sophomore Pat Dodd, who had 21 to go with nine digs and two key solo blocks. Junior Ori Oren finished with 67 assists and missed a triple-double by just one kill.
Oren’s freshman counterpart Rob Lothman set career highs with 67 assists and five block assists for Harvard. Sophomore Matt Jones led the game with 26 kills, and co-captain Erik Kuld added 24. Rosier finished with 13 kills and just one error, good for a team-best .706 attack percentage. He also had four block assists.
“At some points, we didn’t play with the same confidence or swagger that we’d been showing earlier,” Weintraub said.
Despite the pair of tough losses, the team isn’t letting its confidence dwindle heading into a huge final weekend of regular-season play.
“Losing to NYU didn’t by any means knock us out,” Rosier said. “If we go in and take care of business next weekend, we’ll get second place, go to the playoffs, and I believe that’s how it’s going to go.”
RUTGERS-NEWARK 3, HARVARD 0
Friday night’s contest against the Raiders brought less drama, as Rutgers-Newark wrapped up its division title in a 3-0 sweep at the Golden Dome.
The Raiders were led by sophomore outside hitter Marcin Midura, who had 17 kills in Rutgers-Newark’s 30-28, 30-26, 30-24 victory. Despite the sweep, the match was competitive throughout, with 26 ties and 10 lead changes.
In the first set, the Raiders jumped to an 18-12 lead before a Crimson rally pulled Harvard within one, 18-17. But after the teams alternated points as the game moved toward its climax, Rutgers-Newark was able to score the game’s final two points and win by that margin.
In set two, no team was able to get ahead by more than four points. Rosier and freshman Derek Jansma were able to co-block a Raider match point at 29-25, but a Harvard mistake on the next play cost the Crimson the game.
“We were just outmatched,” Rosier said. “They’re playing really well right now. We made it close, we fought...we just didn’t capitalize on certain opportunities that we had to at least take a game from them.”
Kuld had 15 kills and seven digs for the Crimson, and Jones added 14 kills and two aces. Rosier contributed six kills and four block assists, while Lothman dished out 35 assists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No. 16 Radcliffe heavyweight crew had every intention of redeeming its loss against Brown last week as it took on No. 6 Princeton and Cornell this past Saturday. But the cool waters of Cayuga Lake Inlet simply didn’t flow in the Black and White’s favor, as Radcliffe was outmatched by both of its Ancient Eight rivals in the Class of 1975 Cup.
Radcliffe (0-3) dropped each of its five races, allowing the undefeated Tigers (6-0) to cruise to another cup win. Princeton handily clinched the Varsity Eight, Second Varsity Eight, and Varsity Four contests, crossing the finish line at 6:51.9, 6:58.0, and 8:00.6, respectively. The victory handed the Tigers their 22nd win in the Class of 1975 Cup series. Meanwhile, the Big Red (3-3) sped past the Black and White in the Third Varsity race at 7.24.4, and in the Fourth Varsity at 8:00.4.
“I had hoped we had made progress in the past week [at practice], but obviously the results didn’t show that,” said Black and White coach Liz O’Leary.
For Radcliffe, the regatta seemed to be a standout performance for the wrong reasons. The Black and White witnessed a stark gap between its results at practice and its times on race day, leaving many on the team at a loss for explanation.
“It’s hard to put [what happened] into words,” said junior 2V rower Kate Morris. “On the whole, we didn’t perform the way one ideally would like to, but we hope that we’ll be able to improve.”
The most surprising results for Radcliffe came in the First and Second Varsity races. The Black and White 2V boat’s time of 7:08.6 was unexpectedly almost 10 seconds faster than the higher-ranked 1V boat’s results.
“I don’t particularly think the first boat performed to the speed it’s shown in the past,” O’Leary said. “We definitely need to see improvement on the first and second boat levels and have to find a way to be more competitive on the racecourse.”
Yet some of the rowers opted to interpret the 2V squad’s result as an indication of the team’s potential.
“There were performances during the race that were positive enough to provide the team optimism to move forward in the future,” Morris said. “My [2V] boat did well. I gave the race everything that I had, and that in itself is a huge accomplishment for me.”
In fact, the Varsity Four boat gave Radcliffe its closest shot at redemption.
Despite trailing Cornell’s boat for much of the course length at headwind, the Black and White was able to catch up in the final 500 meters and finished only one-tenth of a second behind the Big Red for third place in 8:18.3.
Still, Radcliffe has now surrendered regattas to three straight Ivy League opponents.
Yet, the Black and White knew full well entering the spring that its strength and resolve would be tested over the course of the season. Between graduating 12 seniors last year—most of whom were on the 1V or 2V boats—and facing a challenging schedule, Radcliffe realizes that success lies in constantly making adjustments.
“You can’t forget that the teams we’ve raced over the past few weeks are in the top five or six crews in the nation,” O’Leary said. “Winning might require new team combinations, but ultimately it’s going to come down to whoever’s in the lineup figuring out how to be faster on race day.”
Up next for Radcliffe is a quest to claim the O’Leary Cup against Syracuse and No. 20 Dartmouth on the Charles this coming weekend.
“Dartmouth looks particularly strong this year,” O’Leary said. “The only way to get faster is to race fast crews. The downside to that is if you’re even a little bit off your game, you end up paying the price.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The women’s tennis team traveled to Princeton (18-5, 5-0 Ivy) and Penn (4-13, 0-5) this weekend riding a four-match win streak and looking to give itself the inside track to an Ivy League title. But the squad would face its biggest challenge this season against the league favorite Tigers, who shared the Ivy crown with Harvard last season.
Unfortunately for the Crimson (11-7, 3-1), No. 28 Princeton fended off No. 53 Harvard, 5-2, on Friday, putting the Tigers in the driver’s seat for a league title with only two matches against Ancient Eight bottom dwellers Cornell (11-9, 1-3) and Columbia (9-12, 0-5) to play. On Saturday, the Crimson began a new win streak in defeating the Quakers, 7-0.
“Friday we had a tough match against Princeton, and then we bounced back against Penn,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “Now we’re reloading for Brown on Friday.”
HARVARD 7, PENN 0
Saturday brought the Crimson nothing but wins. In fact, the Crimson only lost one set the entire afternoon.
“Our goal was to beat them as badly as possible,” junior captain Samantha Rosekrans said.
“Overall, we came to play,” Green added. “We executed the whole way through, which was great to see.”
The squad opened the afternoon with a sweep in doubles play. Sophomore Holly Cao and Rosekrans shut out their opponents, 8-0, at No. 1. Meanwhile, freshmen Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton won, 8-2, at No. 2, and sophomores Caroline Davis and Samantha Gridley took the No. 3 match, 8-3.
In singles play, No. 56 Cao improved to 13-3 on the No. 1 court with her 6-1, 6-2 victory over Alexa Ely.
On the next court, No. 121 Tachibana won her first set, 6-2, but found herself tied 5-5 with Emily Wolf in the second before pulling out the next two games to extend her win streak to five matches.
Norton made quick work of Jacqueline Wong, 6-2, 6-1, while Rosekrans defeated Jules Rodin, 6-2, 6-3, at No. 4 for her sixth-consecutive singles victory.
Freshman Alexandra Lehman and Gridley recorded victories at No. 5 and No. 6, respectively.
“Our squad played like a unit against Penn, had a target in mind, and went for it,” Green said.
PRINCETON 5, HARVARD 2
Facing its fellow defending Ivy champion for the second time this season, Harvard hoped it could repeat its 4-2 victory over the Tigers in February at the ECAC Women’s Indoor Tennis Championship Tournament. Playing in Princeton, N.J., this time, the Crimson couldn’t pull off the repeat and dropped its first league match this season, while the Tigers remained undefeated in Ivy play.
“I think we did a better job of executing in February,” Green said. “Princeton took it up a notch [this time], and at the key moments, they executed better. We believe and we know the season is not over until it’s over. We’re going to do all we can to come in second or tie them.”
“We knew they were undefeated and came off a couple big wins,” Rosekrans said. “They just outplayed us. We were really devastated. It takes us out of the running to win the Ivy League title.”
The match opened with Harvard falling in all three doubles matches, handing the Tigers their first point of the afternoon.
Princeton earned its second on the No. 5 court, where junior Agnes Sibilski lost for the first time this season, 6-1, 6-2.
The Tigers moved to the brink of victory when Lehman dropped a 6-3, 6-1 decision at No. 6.
Despite winning in straight sets in February, Cao fell to No. 72 Hilary Barlett this time, 6-1, 6-3, clinching the match for Princeton.
Rosekrans gave the Crimson its first point of the afternoon with her 10th win of the season. After dropping the tightly contested first set, 7-5, she evened the match by taking the second, 6-2. In the super tiebreak, she outplayed her opponent to earn a 10-2 win.
“I was getting too reactive in the first set, but pulled it together in the second set and played more calmly,” Rosekrans said.
Norton lost the closest match of the afternoon. Despite losing the first set, 6-4, she came back to win the second, 7-5. In the super tiebreak, Norton lost by the slimmest of margins, 11-9.
The afternoon ended with Tachibana winning her 11th match of the season, taking the No. 2 court in three sets. After losing the first set, 6-3, Tachibana won the second set in a suspenseful tiebreak, 7-6 (9-7). But the super tiebreak went in Tachibana’s favor, 10-0, to make the final score 5-2.
“We second-guessed ourselves a little bit too much.” Green said. “Princeton was the better team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday, the Harvard track and field team traveled to compete in the Brown Invitational, a six-team meet against Brown, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Providence, South Connecticut State, and Bryant. Both the men’s and women’s squad garnered a third-place finish with scores of 122 and 97, respectively.
The Crimson battled not only the five other teams in the meet but also less than ideal weather conditions. Despite the extra opponent, the team was still able to perform and place well, although top finishes were not Harvard’s first priority during the weekend competition.
“I was very pleased with how the meet went,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “The competition was a lot more about focusing on individual aspects and technique rather than marks.”
The Crimson finished behind a dominant Brown, which swept competition in both men’s and women’s play, and Rhode Island, which placed second on both sides. Harvard was able to stay ahead of the remaining teams, which traded places between the men’s and women’s sides.
After spending the last few weekends traveling to Florida, California, and Texas for meets, the closeness of Rhode Island was a relief for the team.
“It was nice to be so close,” co-captain Jack Brady said. “After traveling so much recently, it was a good break to be able to get back to campus and get some rest.”
Brady, who competed in three events on the weekend, helped propel the men’s team to their third-place finish. The senior took fourth place in the shot put with a distance of 15.28 meters—just behind freshman teammate Edward Brucker—took second in the discus throw with a distance of 46.92m, and captured first in the hammer throw with a distance of 56.82m.
For Brady, the weekend provided the opportunity to improve as a team and to prepare for the main part of the season.
“This weekend was a stepping stone,” Brady said. “There’s a lot more to accomplish, but this was just one more step in the process of a good season.”
Also contributing for the men’s side were sophomores John Dingus and Darcy Wilson, who crossed the line first in the 400m and 800m events, respectively. Dingus notched a time of 48.23 in his event, while Wilson finished in 1:53.41—both efforts that separated the winners from their closest competition by more than a second. Other first-place finishers for the Crimson were co-captain Justin Grinstead, and freshmen Fedor Garin and Kenneth Wang Kan who competed in the 400m hurtles, pole vault, and long jump, respectively.
The women’s team was similarly successful, recording three first-place finishes from freshmen Jasmine Cho and Sydnie Leroy, and junior Hilary May in the 400m dash, 800m run, and pole vault, respectively. Cho also crossed the line fourth in the 200m dash, following closely behind junior teammate Katrina Drayton, who posted a third-place finish with a time of 25.57. Another set of contributors for Harvard were sophomores Nicole Cochran and Kirsten Jorgensen, who each placed third in the 1,500 and 3,000m run with times of 4:33.64 and 10:34.86. Finally, freshman Shannon Watt competed in the shot put and discus, throwing distances of 13.91m and 41.70m—good enough for a third- and fourth-place finish in her respective events.
For a weekend that was focused more on technique than places, the Crimson still claimed a number of top finishes in all events.
“The weekend finish set us up well for the rest of the season,” Saretsky said. “It was a good last chance for fine tuning before the heart of competition.”
With a meet against Yale looming next weekend, Harvard can use this last chance to gain momentum against its rivals.
“We did good work this weekend,” Brady said. “Now we’re ready to put together a better performance to beat up on the bulldogs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 46-year dual challenge history between the No. 4 Harvard heavyweight varsity crew and the No. 3 Brown varsity team, the Crimson holds a 37-9 advantage in the Stein Cup. Harvard consistently produces one of the fastest varsity squads in the nation. Meanwhile, Brown has been striving to do the same, pulling out wins over the Crimson at Eastern Sprints and IRAs last season.
And while the Bears clinched the Stein Cup Saturday for the first time since 2007, the Crimson held them to close margins—reminding them it won’t be over until Sprints.
The Harvard rowing team hit the road for the second consecutive weekend to race Brown on the Seekonk River in Providence Saturday. The Crimson varsity eight maintained overlap with the Bears throughout the entire race, but ultimately came up two or three seats short of victory.
Harvard and Brown were even off of the line, but in the first few hundred meters, the Crimson took a slight advantage. Into the second 500 meters of the race, Harvard extended its lead to roughly four seats.
But the Bears made their move going into the 1,000-meter mark. Brown continued to take seats in the third 500 of the race, holding as much as an eight-seat advantage at one point. The Crimson kept pace and then moved up almost six seats in the sprint to finish just one second behind, 5:42.5 to 5:41.5.
“This week, we were still experimenting with our strategy during races,” said captain and varsity boat seven seat Blake Pucsek. “So we just wanted to row our race and stay very internal. We picked up when we wanted to pick up, and maybe we could have gone a little sooner or something, but we could maybe work on [that] for next time.”
Like the first varsity eight, the rest of Harvard’s varsity squad was just off of Brown’s pace. The second varsity eight finished just over two seconds back from Brown in a time of 5:54.0.
The Crimson’s third varsity boat lost by a little more than three seconds in 5:59.7.
Harvard came away with wins in both the fourth varsity and second freshman combination race and the first freshman race. The Crimson rookies garnered the largest margin of victory of any race on the day with a 12.3-second win in a time of 5:53.9.
Small margins for the varsity and big wins in the freshmen events bode well for Harvard down the line this season.
LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. CORNELL, PENN, GEORGETOWN, ST. JOSEPH’S
The Harvard lightweight men’s team faced back-to-back days of competition this weekend and came away with nearly all boats winning every race.
The Crimson first traveled to Ithaca, N.Y., where it raced Cornell and Penn on Saturday morning. Then the squad bussed back to Cambridge and woke up early yesterday to face Georgetown and St. Joseph’s.
“We were pretty clear that the weekend wouldn’t be over until Sunday morning,” captain Martin Eiermann said. “We would have to focus on both races and prepare for both races.”
The varsity’s preparation paid off, as it swept its opponents in all races this weekend. Harvard’s first boat opened up a big lead against the Big Red and the Quakers at Cayuga Inlet on Saturday. The course involved two slight turns that have given some crews difficulty in the past, but the Crimson stuck to its plan to get out early and keep building a lead.
“We solidified more of a race plan through the week and executed that really well,” said sophomore stroke Tim Moore. “[Senior coxswain Dexter Louie] handled the turns in the race course really well too. It was good to see that the preparation we did during the week played out with our ratings and moves through the race and our sprint.”
The varsity beat its first Ivy League opponents of the season, Cornell and Penn, by 11.3 and 11.8 seconds, respectively, finishing in a final time of 6:14.3.
Yesterday, the first eight built off of Saturday’s performance, outpacing Georgetown by nearly six seconds and St. Joseph’s by over 30 seconds in an overall time of 6:24.6.
The Crimson second varsity eight and first and second novice eights also went undefeated this weekend.
Cornell’s third varsity eight edged out Harvard’s boat by 0.6 seconds on Saturday, but the oarsmen regrouped in fours yesterday, and the Crimson A four defeated Georgetown by 11.6 seconds.
“I don’t want to make any predictions as to where we stand right now, because we should let the races later down the line speak to that,” Eiermann said. “But for ourselves, we’re very happy with where we are right now. We can come out of this weekend with our chins held high, knowing that we’re on the right path.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, Harvard men’s tennis was done messing around.
After unanticipated losses to Cornell and Columbia last weekend, the Crimson reasserted itself with two consecutive wins.
Harvard (11-10, 2-2 Ivy) won a tight 5-2 match over Princeton (8-11, 4-1) on Friday, gaining momentum for Saturday’s 7-0 pounding of the University of Pennsylvania (11-8, 1-4).
“Coming into this weekend, it was difficult at first since we lost to Columbia and Cornell,” junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans said. “[Wins like these] should be our results against Ivy League teams. I’m most proud of the guys coming back and rebounding so well.”
HARVARD 7, PENN 0
Riding a strong victory from Friday, Harvard crushed the Quakers on Saturday by a score of 7-0. The match was played indoors due to wind.
The opening doubles play proved to be the most contested part of the match. After junior Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Christo Schultz teamed up to win the No. 1 match, 8-5, freshmen Will MacNamee and Joshua Tchan fell 8-6 at No. 3.
“[Penn] was better in the doubles than I anticipated,” said head coach Dave Fish ’72. “We were kind of sluggish.”
After a 7-7 tie in the deciding No. 2 match, the Crimson pairing of junior Alistair Felton and freshman Andy Nguyen finally took control, winning 9-7 and securing the first point of the day for Harvard.
Singles was a much easier fight. Chijoff-Evans pulled off a fast victory at No. 1, and Schultz and Felton followed at No. 5 and No. 6, respectively, giving the Crimson four points and the win.
“Lex hadn’t played doubles, so he could pour all his energy into the singles,” Fish said. “Christo’s coming on, getting better.”
Chijoff-Evans won 6-2, 6-3, while Schultz posted a 6-3, 6-2 score. Felton dropped the middle set in a 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 victory.
In the three remaining matches, No. 4 Nguyen, No. 3 Omodele-Lucien, and No. 2 Tchan finished up their victories to complete the sweep.
Tchan finished in a super-tiebreaker, 6-1, 4-6, 13-11, as did Omodele Lucien, who won 7-6, 2-6, 10-6. Nguyen came back from a set down to win 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
The match displayed more lineup shifts, with Tchan playing higher than he has played all this year at No. 2, and Felton as low as he has played all year at No. 6.
“We’ve been turning it over like a Laundromat just so the guys who are playing No. 2 and 3 don’t get their confidence shattered,” Fish explained. “When the confidence is there, you let them go [to the higher positions]. Its just that close [up and down the lineup].”
HARVARD 5, PRINCETON 2
In the first match of the weekend, Harvard outplayed the Tigers for an anything-but-easy 5-2 victory.
“That was one of the closest 5-2 victories you’ll ever see,” Fish said. “The difference between a 5-2 win and a 5-2 loss is just a few points. They were coming on so hard at the end...I don’t think we’ve played a team that has been so intense.”
The Crimson’s ever-strong doubles play resulted in a 1-0 lead to start off, as the Harvard No. 1 team came through with a 9-8 victory and the No. 2 team held off break point after break point for an 8-6 win.
“Getting the doubles point, that dampened [Princeton] a little bit,” Fish said.
Chijoff-Evans rebounded from a 6-0 loss in the first to win the next two sets, 6-4, 6-4. His opponent, Charlie Brosens, made only one unforced error in the first eight games and was up a set and a break when the Crimson junior began coming back.
“I was playing really poorly in the first set and finally got some momentum going,” Chijoff-Evans said. “I carried it into [the match on Saturday].”
No. 4 Nguyen—down a set and two breaks—began a comeback act of his own. As the momentum aggregated for Harvard, the players began to take control.
“The lift effect of having Lex and Andy start to power back was huge,” Fish said. “It was a great display of fortitude by our team. I was very grateful to get out of there with a win.”
Although Nguyen eventually dropped his match, Tchan, Felton, and Schultz, won at the No. 3, 5, and 6 spots, respectively, pushing the Harvard total to five points and giving the Crimson the match.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the golf world fixated on the return of a certain player at the Masters, the Harvard men’s golf team watched a different type of Tiger—Princeton’s golfers, who hosted this weekend’s Princeton Invitational.
The 54-hole tournament took place over two days at Springdale Golf Club and featured 15 teams, including seven Ivies. Although the Crimson took a one-stroke lead into the final round, Yale and Harvard tied with a final score of 874, and the tiebreaker went to the Bulldogs on the score of the fifth player.
“We were counting [scores] as everyone came in today, and we [knew] that it was tied,” sophomore Tony Grillo said. “Today they just happened to have the lower fifth score than we did, so they took the tournament.”
The second place finish was an improvement over Harvard’s fortunes last year when it took eighth place in a rain-soaked event. The weather was much improved this time around as the teams enjoyed two sunny days.
“We had great weather for the tournament,” Grillo said. “Yesterday it started out a little bit cold...and then it warmed up in the afternoon. Today it was not as much wind...and much warmer. We were in shorts and short-sleeve shirts all day.”
Springdale Golf Club, a par-71 course that stretches 6,380 yards, presented a change of pace for Harvard.
“It’s really target golf as opposed to a lot of the courses we play which are wide open,” Grillo said. “It’s a shorter course which we don’t always see for college golf tournaments—normally [something] that we can take advantage of, as you saw some low scores this tournament.”
“The pins were a lot tougher today than they were yesterday, but the conditions were a little bit easier,” senior Greg Shuman said.
The Crimson took advantage of the good weather and short course with three players finishing in the top 12. Sophomore Mark Pollak led the way by posting a score of 215 (69-77-69), good enough for fourth place.
“Mark’s a really good player. He’s really starting to get it going as we near the end of the season, which is good for us,” Grillo said.
“Mark played well except for a few holes out there,” Shuman added. “I think all of us sort of feel that way—we played well and just made a few too many mistakes.”
Consistent play earned Shuman and Grillo an eighth and 12th place finish, respectively, with scores of 218 (72-73-73) and 219 (73-73-73).
Junior Louis Amira rounded out Harvard’s top four by shooting a 229 (80-71-78), and captain Danny Mayer scored a 231 (74-80-77) in the decisive fifth spot.
Yale topped Harvard, thanks largely to the performance of junior Tom McCarthy. McCarthy bested the entire field by three strokes en route to finishing the tournament three under par. The Bulldogs fifth player—freshman Carson Weinand—carded a 228 (79-75-74) to edge Mayer in the tiebreaker.
The other Ivies did not fare as well as Yale and the Crimson. Penn finished fourth with 878, Princeton came in ninth scoring an 895, Cornell was two strokes behind the hosts in 10th, Columbia ended up in 13th with 905, and Dartmouth fell to last place after shooting a 925.
The tournament provided a glimpse at the relative hierarchy within the conference.
“Our goal, ultimately, at the end of the season is to win the Ivy League championship,” Shuman said. “I think this week showed more than any that we definitely have a chance and [have] just got to keep improving and getting better each week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Someone turned on the power at O’Donnell Field.
The Harvard baseball team’s bats came alive in a two-game sweep of Gehrig Division leader Penn (12-13, 3-3 Ivy) at home on Saturday.
The Crimson scored 22 runs in its two victories—its highest scoring two-game series of the season.
“It’s huge for us [to take this sweep],” said junior captain and catcher Tyler Albright.
Harvard batters hit .421 on the day, and sophomores Marcus Way and Jeff Reynolds each homered to lead the Crimson in the sweep.
Strong winds blowing out to right field benefited left-handed hitters, and it seemed that every ball lifted to right found its way into the bushes beyond the fence.
“With that wind blowing, I wish I had seven other lefties in the lineup,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said.
“We had a lot of long-pitch at bats, saw a lot of pitches, got a lot of guys on, and had big innings,” Albright said.
HARVARD 12, PENN 9
The Crimson scored six runs in the fifth inning and took advantage of another strong pitching performance from junior Eric Eadington to win the second game of the doubleheader and finish the one-day sweep of the Quakers.
Down 1-0 after the first inning and puzzled by junior Paul Cusick’s curveball, the Crimson managed three runs in the fourth to take a 3-1 lead.
In the fifth, following Way’s RBI double, Cusick walked junior Sam Franklin and senior Dan Zailskas with the bases loaded, adding two more runs. Brent Suter made the two free passes hurt with an RBI single through the right side, scoring Franklin and Albright. With the hit-and-run on, freshman Kyle Larrow then grounded out to the pitcher, giving Zailskas time to score the sixth run of the inning before junior Dillon O’Neill struck out looking to end the frame.
“They helped us a little with the base on balls, but we did have some clutch hits that inning,” Walsh said. “Anytime you’re going to hang up a big inning, you have to get some big hits in there.”
Penn opened up its half of the sixth with back-to-back solo homers by junior Dan Williams and senior William Gordon, but Eadington quickly settled in and recorded three quick outs. The junior came back strong in the seventh, striking out the side on 10 pitches. Eadington earned his third win of the season, giving up four runs in seven innings while striking out 10.
The Harvard pitcher also made two highlight-reel plays in the second inning, catching a hard-hit one-hopper off the bat of junior Will Davis. On the next play, Quaker senior Steve Grable hit a pitch hard up the middle to Eadington, who calmly knocked down the line drive and threw Grable out at first.
“If he had ever made that play before [today], I might have believed it,” Walsh joked. “He’s not our great fielding pitcher.”
Down 12-5 in the top of the ninth, Penn loaded the bases against freshman reliever Andrew Ferreira, and Quaker junior Jeremy Maas hit a grand slam to left, quickly turning what seemed to be a blowout into a three-run game. Walsh called Zailskas to the mound from first base, and he easily got the final two outs to clinch the sweep and earn his third save of the season.
“We had Dan ready in the seventh just in case,” Walsh said. “[He] came in with a three run lead and I like that [situation].”
HARVARD 10, PENN 9
The Crimson erased a six-run deficit with two consecutive four-run frames in the fourth and fifth innings to sneak out of the first game of the twin-bill with a victory.
The Quakers put up eight runs on sophomore pitcher Connor Hulse in the top of the fourth inning, in which the visitors sent 14 batters to the plate and easily overcame an early 2-0 Harvard lead. Still, Albright maintained that the squad was unfazed.
“When we came in from that inning, everyone was positive and ready to go,” the junior captain said.
The Crimson quickly scored four runs in the bottom of the fourth, closing the gap to a more manageable 8-6. Larrow hit an RBI double to deep center field, scoring Way. Senior Chris Rouches followed it with a double of his own, plating Larrow and Reynolds. After advancing to third on a hit-and-run play, Rouches scored on a sacrifice fly by Franklin.
Harvard followed the four-run fourth with four more in the fifth, pulling ahead of the Quakers for good. Following a double by Albright, Way hit a long drive over the right field fence off of Penn sophomore Patrick Brennan to even the score at eight. Following hits by Reynolds and Zailskas and a walk to Rouches, O’Neill singled through the left side of the infield, scoring two runs that proved to be the difference in the game.
“It was good to get the bats going,” Way said. “We dug ourselves a hole, and then we did a good job of coming back.”
Penn threatened in the sixth, scoring a run to close within one, but sophomore Will Keuper closed it out for his second save of the season, pitching two scoreless innings and giving up only two hits.
“[Keuper is] a cool cucumber out there on the mound,” Walsh said. “Having him to finish that first game was real important for us.”
Hulse pitched three scoreless innings before giving up eight runs in 1/3 of an inning in the fourth. Junior Dan Berardo earned the win after relieving Hulse in the fourth and going 1.2 innings. Brennan took the loss for the Quakers, surrendering three runs in just 1/3 of an inning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether it’s a blowout or a closer affair, the change in the win-loss column is the one figure that counts. For the Crimson, its two games progressed differently, but in the end, both meant the same thing.
Harvard (10-17, 4-4 Ivy), playing against Columbia (15-13, 6-2 Ivy) at O’Donnell Field yesterday, lost both games of its doubleheader with the Lions. In the first game, the Crimson never had a chance, falling behind, 9-0, after three innings and losing in an absolute rout by the score of 24-1 in the seven-inning contest.
In the last leg of the doubleheader, Harvard rebounded early and jumped to a 4-0 lead. But in the late innings, the bullpen faltered and the team fell again, 7-4, for the two-game sweep. The Crimson did not score after the third inning.
“We got our butts kicked,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “They were a good-hitting ballclub today.”
COLUMBIA 7, HARVARD 4
After its trouncing in the first game, Harvard looked to regroup and contend for a series split.
In the first inning, it looked like the Crimson would be able to do just that. After starting pitcher Brent Suter struck out two in the opening frame, Harvard scored three runs—all with two outs—to take an early lead.
“Suter gave us a shot in the arm coming out, and we got the three runs in the first inning that boosted morale pretty well,” Walsh said.
The Crimson added one more in the third on junior Sean O’Hara’s RBI double to push the lead to four, and Suter shut out the Lions through five frames.
In the sixth, though, the Crimson starter seemed to tire, allowing his first runs of the game on a two-run home run from Columbia left fielder Dario Pizzano.
After the game, Walsh revealed that Suter pulled his triceps on the previous play while diving to field a slow grounder that went for an infield single. Suter managed to finish the inning, leaving the game with eight strikeouts and just two runs allowed.
But once the bullpen came into the game in the seventh, Harvard could not maintain its lead for more than a third of an inning.
“We had two or three innings there where we fell apart pitching-wise,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “We just need to be able to close out games like that.”
After an RBI double from Nick Cox to tie the game, the Lions scored a pair on a Nick Ferraresi bases-clearing double to open up a one-run lead that they would not relinquish.
Sophomore Will Keuper, charged with all three seventh-inning runs, picked up the loss—his second of the season.
The Crimson allowed two more runs in the ninth inning, pushing the game to a three-run margin.
Though he admitted that the team was discouraged after the first game, Walsh would not attribute this second loss of the afternoon to the team’s mentality.
“It’s not always morale,” he said. “Sometimes it’s how you play the game.”
COLUMBIA 24, HARVARD 1
If Harvard had plated any other number of runs, the score of the day’s first contest would have read more like that of a football game.
The Lions scored in every frame, and after the team held a 6-0 second-inning lead, the game already appeared out of reach.
“We didn’t play well in the first game—that’s for sure,” Albright said. “We fell apart. Hitting, defense, and pitching weren’t there.”
Perhaps the game’s most compelling story was a bump in the road to recovery for junior starter Max Perlman, making his second start of the season after Tommy John surgery. Perlman increased his workload to 1.1 innings, allowing five earned runs—including a first-inning three-run home run.
“It’s been a while since he’s pitched,” Walsh said. “He’s had basically four innings in the last three years—three innings last year and [a one-inning appearance last weekend] under his belt.”
As the game progressed, the Lions continued piling on the offense. With a 19-run lead in the top of the seventh­—the game’s last inning­—Pizzano hit a grand slam off of freshman reliever Robert Wineski.
Columbia had 24 hits to match its run total in the game. The Crimson could manage only four, and magnified its troubles with three errors.
Harvard’s relief pitching also struggled with command, surrendering eight walks in the game.
“We couldn’t get ahead of guys, and when you can’t get ahead of hitters, you’re forced to throw fastballs,” Albright said. “They were clearly just waiting for a fastball to come right down the middle, and just geared up for it and hit it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first of two doubleheaders this weekend, Harvard softball split games with Penn (11-14, 6-2 Ivy) on Saturday, losing a well-contested 5-4 game in the nightcap after pummeling the Quakers—who entered the matchup with an undefeated record in Ivy League play—10-0 in the opener.
“It’s tough not to feel bad after a day like this, because of course we wanted to win both,” said junior second baseman Ellen Macadam. “It’s very disappointing that we couldn’t pull it out in the end, but there were a lot of really good things today. [Sophomore Rachel Brown] pitched [well] in the first game, and we did a lot of great things offensively.”
The Crimson, which sits atop the Ivy League North Division standings, had an impressive day at the plate, scoring a total of 14 runs against a squad that came into the afternoon leading the South Divison.
PENN 5, HARVARD 4
An outburst of five runs in the second inning led Penn past the Crimson in Saturday’s second game. The Quakers, batting first, came out on fire in their only inning of scoring. A run by sophomore pinch runner Elora Daniele on a wild pitch opened up the floodgates, and after Penn batted arond, the onslaught was finally ended with a key tag-out by senior catcher Jess Pledger and an out on a ground ball.
“In the second inning, our pitching gave up a bunch of runs,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “That set us back five runs. I think it deflated us a bit and we needed to come right back and score...and we didn’t do that.”
Harvard opened the scoring in the first inning of the nightcap, as senior center fielder Stephanie Krysiak crossed home plate on an illegal pitch. The Crimson didn’t add another run until the fourth inning, when Macadam batted in junior left fielder Emily Henderson, who had reached base on a double.
“We had a lull in the middle innings,” Allard said. “We started to come on in the sixth inning; we were close and just ran out of time. The difference was [that in the first game] we had the lead and kept the lead.”
A strong two-run comeback effort by the Crimson—led by a 2-RBI single from co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor—in the sixth inning fell short. Penn ended the game with a double play in the bottom of the seventh.
The loss was especially disappointing for the Crimson, as every individual, including the seniors, suffered their first career loss to Penn.
“Before today, Penn had never beaten any one of us,” Macadam said. “They’re always a good, strong opponent, but they had never been able to pull it out against anyone on the team currently. We were [undefeated] before today. We have a tough rivalry with them, not wanting to let them beat us.”
HARVARD 10, PENN 0
The first game of the series ended after the top of the fifth, as Harvard’s dominant pitching and ample scoring elicited the mercy rule.
“Offensively, we were strong,” Allard said. “We really were aggressive early in [the] count...and had some really good presence at the plate today.”
Eight players scored for the Crimson, led by Macadam and sophomore first baseman Whitney Shaw with two runs each. Shaw and freshman pitcher Jess Ferri each added a home run.
“We were just stringing them together,” Macadam said. “We really just came out firing. Every game is so important in the way softball works, to get to the championship, so we just really wanted to kill them. They were undefeated, and we wanted to show them we were better.”
Brown played well on Saturday, pitching the entire first game and allowing no runs on five hits to capture her seventh win of the season. Though the shutout was in jeopardy several times, Brown and the Harvard defense came up big each time with key outs.
The Quakers loaded the bases late in the third inning and left two runners on base at the end of the fourth, but were unable to capitalize on either of these opportunities. The strong defensive effort and hot bats helped the Crimson to the blowout victory.
“We’ve been approaching one game at a time, one pitch at a time,” Allard said. “We had a lot of confidence going into today, where we were playing strong against Princeton and Cornell [last weekend]...It was just disappointing that we came up short the second game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There aren’t that many things Harvard has failed to do since 1998, but beating Cornell in men’s lacrosse is one of them.
A back-and-forth affair ended when Big Red sophomore Rob Pannell scored his third goal of the game with 11 seconds left to win it for his team, 13-12, at Schoellkopf Field on Saturday.
“It’s obviously a disappointing loss,” Crimson coach John Tillman said. “I really feel for the guys. To our credit, the guys responded well, and based on what happened last week [against Duke], it would’ve been easy for them to fold their tents, but they kept working and working.”
No. 15 Harvard (5-4, 1-2 Ivy) has been inching closer to No. 10 Cornell (8-2, 3-1) over the past few years, but hasn’t quite been able to turn the tide on the Big Red.
An 11-7 loss to Cornell in 2008 was the Crimson’s slimmest deficit in four years, and Harvard followed that effort with a 13-12 loss last year. After the Big Red graduated several starters, including Tewaaraton Trophy winner Max Seibald, the Crimson and its third-best recruiting class seemed poised to finally dethrone Cornell, the modern titan of Ivy League lacrosse.
But it was not meant to be.
The Big Red opened the scoring when Ryan Hurley notched an unassisted goal one minute into the contest. Senior Jason Duboe evened the score on Harvard’s next possession with his sixth goal of the season.
Cornell scored the next four goals to take a 5-1 lead with 6:23 left in the first quarter, but sophomores Terry White and Jeff Cohen scored within 50 seconds of each other to close the gap to 5-3 at the end of the opening frame.
Each team recorded a goal in the second quarter, and Hurley nabbed his second goal of the game six minutes into the third to put the Big Red ahead, 7-4. After freshman Jack Doyle scored his career-high second goal of the game, Cohen tallied a pair in 19 seconds to tie the game. Following a Cornell penalty, Cohen found junior Dean Gibbons, who capitalized on the man-up opportunity and gave the Crimson its first lead with 43 seconds left in the third quarter.
The Big Red responded with another four-goal run, stretching its advantage to 11-8 with 5:57 left in the contest. Harvard fought right back with a four-goal streak of its own, taking a 12-11 lead with three minutes left in the game when Gibbons scored his second man-up goal of the contest.
It took Pannell just 17 seconds to even the score with his second goal of the game. Cornell regained possession after the faceoff, and after a long set of pick and rolls, Pannell put a move on sophomore Daniel DiMaria and rifled it past Crimson freshman goalie Harry Krieger for the game-winning goal with only 11 seconds on the clock.
“I’m pretty disappointed,” Cohen said. “I thought we had them right where we wanted them.”
One bright spot for Harvard throughout the game was Krieger’s continued emergence as a force between the pipes. A week after recording a career-high 17 saves against Duke, Krieger stopped 14 Big Red shots Saturday and has taken a stronger hold of the starting goalie position after splitting time with sophomore Christian Coates earlier in the season.
“Harry certainly hasn’t done anything to lose the job...he played well enough for us to win,” Tillman said. “Any time you can get 14 saves out of your goaltender, you expect to win that ball game.”
With only three games remaining and a 1-2 record in conference play, the Crimson must likely win out if it hopes to earn an NCAA tournament berth.
“We can only control our effort and focus,” Tillman said. “I don’t think it’s time well spent worrying about the big picture. What we need to do is see where we can improve and take it practice by practice.”
One aspect that has cost Harvard dearly this season is allowing opponents to string together crushing runs. Georgetown used a 6-1 run to help it defeat the Crimson, 13-12, Brown was able to fend off Harvard, 13-11, with a 5-1 first quarter, and Duke’s 8-0 first quarter was all the offense it needed in defeating the Crimson, 14-5.
“It’s definitely been a pattern for us, and I’m not really sure what we can do,” Cohen said. “I wish there was some switch we could just flip on, but I think that if we just stay more focused and keep our goals for the season in mind, we’ll be fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sophomore Rachel Brown made her mark on Crimson softball history a little over a week ago when she pitched the first no-hitter of her career.
It seems that history likes to repeat itself.
Brown recorded her second no-hitter of the season in the first game of Harvard’s doubleheader against Columbia, leading the Crimson (14-16, 6-2 Ivy) to a 3-0 victory over the Lions (8-20, 1-7) yesterday at Soldiers Field. Harvard completed its sweep in the nightcap with a 2-1 win.
“Columbia played exceptionally well,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “Their pitching was very strong, and they made a lot of the defensive plays that they needed to make...It was a tough battle today.”
The weekend’s results allowed Harvard to close out its non-divisional play on a high note.
“We came out strong,” Allard said. “I think we had a very focused effort, and we played well from pitch to pitch.”
“We have our eyes on winning the North Division,” Brown added. “We can’t let any games go. We have to win every single one. I’m really proud of the team today.”
HARVARD 2, COLUMBIA 1
With some good teamwork in the second inning, Harvard was able to pull ahead and gain enough of the lead to secure its 2-1 victory over the Lions.
With the bases loaded and only one out, it looked like trouble was on the horizon for the Crimson.
But junior second baseman Ellen Macadam fielded a groundball to force an out at home, and sophomore pitcher Julia Moore scooped up a comebacker and threw it to first for the final out, allowing Harvard to escape from the jam.
“We didn’t get rattled when they had runners on base who were threatening, which was definitely a strength,” Allard said.
The Crimson then finished out the second with two runners crossing the plate.
Senior Jennifer Francis reached on an error that scored freshman Jessica Ferri, and sophomore Mari Zumbro’s single up the middle plated senior Jessica Pledger.
Columbia was able to get onto the scoreboard in the top of the fourth when freshmen Jennifer Bergeron hit a fielder’s choice that allowed junior Stephanie Yagi to cross the plate.
It wasn’t enough to overcome Harvard, which defended its lead with successful relief pitching by co-captain Margaux Black and Brown.
The Crimson emerged from the second game of its doubleheader with a clean sweep.
“We got enough runs to string it together,” Brown said. “We were happy we came out on the winning end.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 0
Brown pitched the second no-hitter of her career to lead Harvard to a 3-0 victory over the Lions in yesterday’s opener. With 90 pitches, she allowed one baserunner on a first-inning error and struck out 12, securing her ninth win of the season.
“No-hitters are very tough to get,” Allard said. “She was strong. She executed well and was very zoned in...Rachel was outstanding today and was definitely a strength for us.”
The defense was strong on both sides, as Columbia pitcher Maureen O’Kane was able to match Brown through the first five innings to keep the scoreboard clear.
But she couldn’t hold off the Crimson quite long enough.
Francis sparked Harvard in the bottom of the sixth with a single to right field. Consecutive bunts by juniors Emily Henderson and Macadam helped Harvard load the bases.
Senior Stephanie Krysiak then had a sharp 2-RBI hit over second base to put the Crimson on the scoreboard. Sophomore Whitney Shaw finished the spree with a double over the shortstop, bringing Krysiak home to give Harvard a 3-0 lead and the game.
“We did enough and got it done,” Brown said. “We’ve learned that every game matters the hard way...so these games are huge for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only two weeks remaining before the Ivy League Championships, the Harvard women’s golf team appears poised to be in strong contention for its third-straight Ancient Eight title.
The Crimson continued to steamroll its competition this weekend, as the squad won the Dartmouth Spring Invitational at the Cape Cod Country Club in Hatchville, Mass., by a margin of 38 strokes.
“It’s a building block for Ivies, and we continue to get a little bit better every week,” Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads said. “We shot quite a good number today—a lot of positives to take away from this weekend.”
Harvard dominated the two-round tournament with a final team score of 589, while second-place Siena finished with a total of 627.
A 669 by Dartmouth was good for third, and Central Connecticut State and Boston University rounded out the competition with a 690 and 692, respectively.
The lowest four scores out of each school’s five competitors were counted in the team event.
Opening the par-71, 6,018-yard course with a 301 Saturday—earning it the top spot by 12 strokes—Harvard did not let up the second time around, turning in a four-over-par 288, a score that bested Siena’s second-round try by 26 shots.
“I definitely like to see improvement from one day to the next,” Rhoads said. “It’s kind of a typical trend, and I like that. But it also tells me that we don’t put added pressure on ourselves; we just keep on paying attention and getting a little bit better with the things that we can control.”
Of the field’s top seven golfers, all but one hailed from Harvard, which saw every one of its seven players finish in the top 10.
Despite being seeded fourth on her squad, sophomore Christine Cho was the weekend’s top individual performer with a two-day total of 144.
After shooting a 74 Saturday—tying with teammate and captain Claire Sheldon for the best round of the day—the reigning Ivy Rookie of the Year fired a second-day 70, catapulting her to the top of the leaderboard.
“It kind of all came together today,” said Cho, who led all golfers with six birdies. “Not completely, but it was feeling better than it had been earlier in the spring.”
“She’s trending in the direction we expect from her,” Rhoads added. “Most people, when they’re not playing quite as well, tend to panic, but she’s kind of plodded along and continued to work on the things she’s worked on.”
Sheldon maintained her high level of play—having won the individual title two weeks ago against Lynn—by turning in a pair of 74s for second place.
“I had some moments of brilliance and some moments where I struggled a lot,” said the veteran, who led all golfers in par-3 scoring.
Freshman Chloe Altchek and senior Sarah Harvey each tied for third place with scores of 150—their best performances of the spring season—and junior Mia Kabasakalis’s two-day total of 152 placed her sixth overall.
The trio’s placement at the top of the field provided a prime example of the talent coursing throughout the Crimson’s roster.
“We’re in an enviable position, and it’s certainly the reason we’ve won Ivy championships the last couple of years,” Rhoads said. “We have lots of people who can win individually, but we also have a communally strong team—anyone can end up in the top five on any given week, which, on our team, many times means they will be in the top five in the field.”
Freshman Katie Sylvan misfired with a first-day 83, but she salvaged a seventh-place finish with a Sunday 70, tying Cho for the best single round of the tournament.
Competing as an individual along with Altchek, sophomore Jane Lee came home with a 10th-place finish after shooting consecutive rounds of 80.
All in all, Harvard golfers had 20 birdies on the weekend, but Rhoads was wary of heaping too much praise on his squad.
“I definitely think all of us...left shots out there,” Rhoads said. “While we’re certainly pleased with what we did, we also know there are specific areas that we can improve upon.”
The Crimson now prepares for next weekend’s Roar-EE Invitational, its final tune-up before the all-important league championship.
“If everyone keeps pulling their own weight, and pushing one another, then I expect...we will give ourselves a good chance to win Ivies,” Rhoads said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Remember those days of swimming in the neighborhood pool and bouncing off of the cement floor? While fun for a third-grader, it was not so much fun for the Harvard women’s water polo team. Playing in No. 11 Hartwick’s shallow Moyer Pool on Saturday, the Crimson (11-10, 0-1 CWPA North) faced defensive trouble in the new environment, eventually falling to the Hawks (19-4, 1-0), 15-8.
“I thought it was actually one of our better games against Hartwick,” sophomore Monica Zdrojewski said. “They are a very good team, and they have an advantage over us in that they can recruit and give scholarships, which is something that in the Ivy League we don’t have the ability to do.”
In Harvard’s first game of North Division play—after the postponement of last Wednesday’s matchup versus Brown—the Crimson started strong before losing momentum in the last three quarters.
“I thought we put up a good fight,” junior Patty Smith said. “There are always things that we can work on on offense and defense, but we had some people really step up and we are really excited to play them [again] in a pool that is not shallow next weekend.”
The shallow pool, with one end covered with only four feet of water, proved troublesome for Harvard’s athletes.
“I think it affected us a lot,” sophomore Shannon Purcell said. “Their pool, it’s very similar to a backyard pool. They practice in it all the time, so they know how to play with it, but we don’t practice in a shallow pool, so it was really different—like shooting on [the shallow net], because the goal is two feet higher and the goalie can jump off the bottom of the pool.”
Saturday wasn’t just the first time the Crimson played in a less-than-ideal pool this season, but it was also the first time it faced its northern foe.
“[After seeing them play in tournaments], we knew what we were getting ourselves into for the game,” Smith said. “They were pretty much what we expected.”
Knowing the other team was beneficial in the first quarter, as Harvard played Hartwick close, trailing by just one at the end of the first eight minutes, with the score 5-4.
“We were very aggressive,” Purcell said. “We created a lot of opportunities on offense, and we didn’t really rush things this time, so a lot of the goals we got were in the last five seconds [of the shot clock]—which is a really good thing, because we were able to finish and not throw the ball away.”
“I think we had a very good first quarter,” Zdrojewski said. “It was one of the best starts to the game we’ve had this year, and offensively, we were doing a lot of movement. We were able to get the ball to Devan [Kennifer] very effectively, so that was a strong point.”
Sophomore Kennifer was the strongest force for the Crimson, scoring four goals in the first period, while Zdrojewski, Purcell, Smith and senior Roxanne Pinto each tallied one.
“I think Devan Kennifer probably had the game of her life,” Smith said. “The whole team was riding on her energy. Even outside of [her scoring], her attitude and spirit really helped us pull through.”
The rest of the match didn’t fare quite as well, as the Hawks outscored Harvard, 5-2, 3-1, and 2-1, in the final three periods.
“What I think we could improve on is definitely adapting our game,” Zdrojewski said. “When Devan in the first quarter got four goals, they started dropping and double-teaming her, and I think we didn’t do a good job of adapting and changing our game plan based on that.”
Harvard’s players still see a silver lining though, as the team looks to take the lessons from Saturday and apply them to the Crimson’s biggest match of the season thus far. After not having a chance to play last Wednesday because of an absent referee, Harvard seems more than ready to face Brown for the first time this season.
“We’re very excited,” Purcell said. “They are our biggest rival. It was a letdown not being able to play them [last] week, so we’re just even more pumped.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just two weeks ago, it was spring break and, in between generous servings of pasta and gelato, the women's soccer team was competing against Italian teams and watching David Beckham get injured in the AC Milan v. Chievo game. Shouts of “Tira, tira!” (the Italian word for “shoot”) and raucous cries of “Mamma Mia!” are still ringing in my head.
Upon our arrival back in the States, we were faced with a rude awakening: only two games left until the spring season is over. And after this past Friday, we’re down to one.
For most college sports teams in Division I, not much changes in the offseason, as practices resume a normal schedule rapidly after the last few days of the postseason. Not so for Ivy League teams. Strict league rules put extra limits on the number of days that official practices can take place, making the offseason very light in terms of volume but endowing each practice with extra importance. The women’s soccer team, for instance, is allowed just 10 official practices with the coaches in the spring. And the time goes fast.
Playing in our first game since the Italian excursions, women’s soccer took on the Boston Breakers reserve team and Northeastern in a round robin tournament this past Friday. After watching the Breakers beat Northeastern, 2-1, in the first 45-minute mini-game, we stepped out into the torrential downpour to take on our opponents.
Slippery conditions made first touches bounce a little further away than they normally do for all of the teams and the slick turf made the ball extra speedy. Despite the weather, numerous players nursing injuries, and limited amounts of practice time in preparation, the team fought well, tying the Breakers, 0-0, but unfortunately losing to Northeastern, 1-0, on a goal in the first few minutes of play.
The key for these games is development and in the “halftime” talk as well as after the games, the coaches emphasized the fleeting spring season as the beginning of next year’s campaign. In order to make the most of the few opportunities we have to play together in the spring, it’s important not to take them for granted. Though we know we have a lot left to work on, the team left the field wet and cold but excited about the season to come.
An interesting twist to the night came from the Huskies’ bench. This time last year, Northeastern head coach Tracey Leone would have been on the Harvard sideline, coaching alongside her husband, Harvard coach Ray Leone. Tracey recently accepted the head-coaching job for the Huskies, so Friday marked the first time the Leones’ teams have competed against each other. Needless to say, it was a bittersweet moment for all.
Women’s soccer will take on UConn in Connecticut on Apr. 24 to close out the spring season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A cap-and-trade system is the most practical, cost-effective way for the government to limit carbon emissions, according to a paper recently published by Harvard Kennedy School Professor Robert N. Stavins and University of Manchester Economics Professor Robert W. Hahn.
Their paper concluded that Congress is more likely to pass a cap-and-trade system—in which the government puts a cap on the amount of a pollutant that can be emitted—than a carbon tax, because the cap-and-trade system exhibits the “independence property”—the theoretical and actual ability of a system to keep costs low and environmental performance high.
Stavins said in a recent interview with The Crimson that a cap-and-trade system would be more efficient and less controversial than a carbon tax because limiting the total amount of carbon that corporations emit does not require an equal distribution of pollution limits. He explained that while a carbon tax would be superior in theory, a cap-and-trade system would be more practical when political realities are taken into account.
“The government can determine the overall cap however it wants to and then it can leave it up to the representative democracy to fight over the pieces of the pie,” he said.
A carbon tax enacted by the government, on the other hand, would be weaker than a cap-and-trade system because Congress would be too preoccupied with keeping taxes low, Stavins said.
While the number of cap-and-trade policies have decreased in recent years, Stavins said he believes this option is by no means dead.
In the paper, Stavins and Hahn used current-day examples—such as the sulfur dioxide trade amendment in Ohio that aimed to substantially reduce acid rain—to prove that the cap-and-trade system would work both in theory and in practice.
Stavins, who also directs the Harvard Environmental Economics Program, said that the independence property is not a new idea; Harvard-educated economist W. David Montgomery first coined the term in a paper printed by the Journal of Economic Theory in 1972.

Students will find a Haitian-themed dinner in lieu of usual entrees tonight as part of a fundraising effort by the Harvard administration for the victims of the recent earthquake in Haiti.
Menu items, some of which were suggested by Haiti-born HUDS employees, include soup joumou (beef and pumpkin soup), griots (spicy marinated fried pork), Haitian-style chicken, macaroni au gratin, rice and beans, fried plantains, and rice pudding. The menu will be available in all undergraduate dining halls.
The House Committees will raise money for Haiti in different ways in each dining hall. In Eliot, for example, HoCo members will sell Eliot patches for one dollar, according to Eliot HoCo Co-Chair Bryan W. Dunmire ’11.
The Haitian-themed dinner is the latest in a series of initiatives sponsored by Harvard administrators and students to provide assistance to Haiti, which was hit by a magnitude 7.0 earthquake three months ago today.
Among these events was another Haitian-themed dinner held at Harvard Hillel on Feb. 23, which was sponsored by Harvard Hillel, Harvard Haitian Alliance, Harvard Chabad House, and Harvard Caribbean Club. The University also underwrote the Harvard for Haiti concert on Feb. 12, which featured performances by student groups like the Kuumba Singers and Harvard Glee Club.
“I am glad to see that the College has not forgotten about Haiti and that HUDS has decided to prepare Haitian-inspired cuisine for the students,” said David D. Hutchinson ’12, former president of the Harvard Haitian Alliance. “It is also heartening to know that the House Committees will be doing fundraising as well.”
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson and HUDS Executive Director Ted A. Mayer said in a joint statement that for the earthquake’s three-month anniversary they want to “both acknowledge and support our local Haitian community, and extend our hand and our hopes for continued international support during the vital rebuilding period.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former New Hampshire Attorney General and Republican Senate hopeful Kelly A. Ayotte encouraged Republicans to return to the core values of fiscal responsibility, limited government, and national safety at the Harvard Republican Club’s eighth annual Lincoln Day Dinner on Saturday.
Gathering in Eliot dining hall, over 120 attendees—including Harvard undergrads, graduate students, Republicans from schools including Tufts and Wellesley, and Institute of Politics Director Bill Purcell—partook in the HRC’s version of this national tradition.
In her speech, Ayotte explained her plan to fix the “intellectually dishonest” culture in Washington, which she said was exemplified by the recent passage of the health care bill.  The problems with the bill, according to Ayotte, include the intrusion of the federal government into state and individual interests and the “climate of uncertainty” it has created for businesses.
“I come from a state where the motto is ‘Live Free or Die,’ so you can imagine how people feel about the government telling them what to do, regardless of how you feel about health care,” Ayotte said.
To remedy Washington’s culture, Ayotte recommended that Republicans maintain good ideals, stay accountable once elected, and lead with humility.
Club member Christopher L. Oppermann ’13 said that while he thought that Ayotte’s platform was “not particularly unique,” he liked her emphasis on politicians being honest.
In an interview before the event, the HRC’s Vice President of Speakers Luis A. Martinez ’12 said that the HRC leaders chose Ayotte for the event partially because they want to form a long-term relationship with her campaign going into the summer and fall.
HRC President Mark A. Isaacson ’11, who is also a Crimson columnist, referred to Ayotte multiple times as “the next Senator from New Hampshire.”
“It would be nice if we could turn on CNN or CSPAN and hear a Senator talking like that to us today,” Isaacson said.
Past speakers at the HRC’s Lincoln Day Dinner include Vice Chairman of the Republican National Committee’s Platform Committee J. Kenneth Blackwell and Michael S. Steele, who has since become chairman of the RNC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 150 Boston-area cruciverbalists gathered in the Science Center yesterday for the second annual Boston Crossword Puzzle Tournament.
Competitors in the tournament, co-sponsored by the Harvard College Crossword Society and Cruciverbalists of Boston, completed four previously unpublished puzzles slated to appear in The New York Times.
Prizes were awarded to the overall winners as well as those competing in individual and pair divisions. Winners of a Harvard undergraduate division received prizes as well.
The event also featured a presentation by New York Times crossword editor Will Shortz. In addition to editing crosswords for The Times, Shortz also serves as puzzle master for National Public Radio’s “Weekend Edition Sunday,” directs the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and coaches for the World Puzzle Championship.
During his speech, Shortz detailed memorable clues contained within crossword puzzles that he had rejected during his tenure at The Times. He also invited the audience to participate in a word game engineered specifically for the event.
Shortz acknowledged that many people are surprised to find out that crossword solving can be a competitive event.
“A crossword ‘tournament’ is kind of an oddball idea,” he said.  “First of all, normally crosswords are a solitary activity. Secondly, you take your time and enjoy the puzzles. So, why would you come to an event with dozens or hundreds of other people to do crosswords with them and race through the puzzle? It’s sort of crazy,” he added.
Shortz said he believes that many competitors are drawn to tournaments by a sense of community.
“[Community is] part of the appeal of an event like this—it’s the only time of the year when you can meet other puzzle people and just see how good you are as a solver,” he said.
Eric D. Helmuth, the founder of Cruciverbalists of Boston, echoed this sentiment.
“People that enjoy solving crosswords tend to be interesting and funny and also tend to love language. So, strangely enough, for an activity that’s largely solitary, there’s a social angle,” he said.
Harvard Crossword Society treasurer Chelsea S. Link ’12 said that Boston-area cruciverbalists are more formidable than their Harvard-affiliated adversaries.
“The non-student competitors are really intense and take this very seriously. For instance, the guy who won the tournament came all the way from California, which is ridiculous,” she said.

An earlier version of the Apr. 12 news article "Crosswords Turn Competitive" incorrectly stated that the winners of a Harvard undergraduate division were recognized, but did not receive prizes at the Boston Crossword Puzzle Tournament. In fact, awards were given to the Harvard winners, according to Nathaniel S. Rakich '10, the president of the Harvard College Crossword Society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Russell House Tavern, a new restaurant occupying the former Z-Square location at 14 JFK St., opened to crowds of curious customers last Thursday.
The tavern serves massive portions of unpretentious, moderately-priced American cuisine and offers full-service bars with a prodigious selection of liquor and American beers and wines on each of its two floors, according to general manager Ian D. Grossman.
Patrons can dine on New England favorites and tavern staples at the new restaurant, ranging from a $10 griddled English muffin burger to a $28 16-ounce flat iron steak.
The restaurant has about 40 small production American beers and more than 60 American wines, many of which are produced in sustainable, organic, or biodynamic vineyards.
Grossman said that the Harvard community was one of the top three factors he took into consideration before opening the restaurant. He added that he has informally created a “happy meal” for students, which consists of a 16-ounce Brooklyn lager tall boy, one shot of Fernet Branca, and a “giant” burger—priced at $18.
Grossman said that students comprised a sizable portion of the restaurant’s opening weekend crowd, adding that patrons had “cleared out” the Brooklyn lager this past weekend.
Bob C. Hagemann, a student at the Harvard Business School and a former bartender, said that he will “absolutely spend more time” at the Tavern after having visited it yesterday. The new restaurant is an “upscale bar” with “a good drink selection,” Hagemann said, while sipping on a dark and stormy made with homemade ginger beer and spiced rum.
Dave R. Olsen, a Cambridge resident, said he enjoyed the restaurant’s beer selection. He added that he will be back “for sure,” and like Hagemann, he said he would recommend the Tavern to others.
Russell House Tavern is owned by The Grafton Group, which also owns Redline, Temple Bar, and Grafton Street.
According to Patrick M. Lee, one of the four proprietors of The Grafton Group, what sets the Tavern apart are its prices and the unique physical space that it occupies.

A collection of scholars presented what they believed to be the most challenging unsolved problems in the social sciences during a panel held in the Northwest Science Building on Saturday.
Each of the panelists—who represented a range of universities but all spoke from the social science perspective—presented a problem they considered both “important” and challenging to solve. At the conclusion of their presentations, they debated their proposals and engaged in a discussion with audience members.
The panel also kicked off a Web initiative in which users will be invited to vote on the importance of the proposed problems and submit additional issues for consideration.
The day-long symposium was moderated by FAS Divisional Dean of Social Science Stephen M. Kosslyn and included presentations by Peter S. Bearman, Nicholas A. Christakis, Ann Swidler ’66, Nassim N. Taleb, Nick Bostrom, Gary King, Emily Oster ’02, Claudia Goldin, James Fowler, Susan E. Carey ’64, Roland G. Fryer, and Richard J. Zeckhauser ’62.
Corinne Espinoza, the administrative coordinator in the Office of the President and the Provost, voiced her reservations to the panelists about the current approach that most individuals take toward resolving problems in the social sciences.
“We can solve these behavioral questions by incorporating, asking, and listening,” she said. “Why don’t we do more than that?”
Fellow attendee Hyman Hartman, a research scientist in MIT’s biology department, told the panelists that the reading he had done in sociology and economics inspired him to ask two questions: “Is the nation-state a viable, stable entity in a world that’s globalizing in a way that has made the nation-state less viable?” and “Why is there only a Nobel prize in economics? Why isn’t there one in sociology, for example?”
The panel is the culmination of more than a year’s cooperation between the non-profit Indira Foundation, which initiated the effort and also provided financial support, and the Division of Social Science in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
According to the Web site for the Division of Social Science, video of the symposium will likely be made available this afternoon. Web users will then be able to vote and submit additional issues.
Kosslyn added that the next important problem that voters select to be explored will be announced on May 31.

Drawn by the promise of free water bottles, more than 1,330 students flocked to the Malkin Athletic Center last Friday for National Alcohol Screening Day, marking a record level of participation that rose by almost 40 percent from last year.
The annual event, which takes place at hospitals, community centers, and universities around the country, requires individuals to fill out a brief survey about their alcohol use and consult privately with a health professional about their responses.
Ryan M. Travia, the director of Harvard’s Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services (AODS), said that the turnout was especially high this year because students have learned to anticipate the event and encourage their friends to come.
“This is our fifth year of doing this, and the event is institutionalized now,” Travia said. “We had a full court press with advertising, but in my mind, word of mouth is what really works.”
He added that the data from the screening, along with student responses to University Health Services’ recent health assessment survey, will hopefully provide UHS with valuable insight into student drinking patterns.
Travia said that the information will be especially important this year because AODS has projected that alcohol-related hospital admissions at Harvard will rise again after jumping by 35 percent last year.
“We continue to remain curious about the uptick,” he said. “We’ll see if the numbers bear out much differently than in previous years.”
According to C. Chloe Orlando ’11, events chair for the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisor (DAPA) program, the screenings also give students a valuable opportunity to reflect on the role that alcohol plays in their lives.
“Some students come here with serious drinking problems,” Orlando said. “Some of them realize it and some don’t.”
Gregory Rudolph, a freshman proctor who served as a screener for the event, said he found the variation in self-reported experiences to be the most striking aspect of his conversations with students.
“There are some people who never drink in their four years here, and others are drinking heavily every weekend,” Rudolph said.
AODS coordinated the day-long event with help from around 40 students who work as DAPAs as well as nearly 50 screeners drawn from across UHS and the local community.

Former Harvard Overseer and Boston-based intellectual property lawyer William F. Lee ’72 has been selected to serve on the Harvard Corporation and said yesterday that he plans to continue the University’s highest governing body’s efforts to increase its transparency.
The Corporation has recently come under a hailstorm of criticism for what many perceive to be an extreme lack of transparency, but the body has, in recent years, taken steps to increase interactions between the Board of Overseers and the Corporation under the direction of departing Senior Fellow James R. Houghton ’58.
Lee said in an interview with The Crimson yesterday that he supports the increase in transparency and that he plans to go on a listening tour with members of the University before he begins his term as a Corporation member on July 1.
“As any governing body, the Corporation needs to be listening and talking to hear what is going on in the broader community,” he said.
“Increasing communication improves the quality of decisions,” he added.
Lee’s selection marks the end of a search process that reviewed over 80 candidates and solicited advice and input from a larger portion of the Harvard community than the Corporation has typically included in its decisions.
“We were looking for somebody who had deep commitment to Harvard and energy and enthusiasm about contributing to the institution,” said Corporation member Robert D. Reischauer ’63, who chaired the search committee and will assume the role of senior fellow when Houghton departs.
Lee emerged as the consensus candidate and received nearly universal support from those involved in the selection process, according to Overseer Lynn W. Chang ’75, who added that many thought it would be helpful to appoint someone from the Boston area who could more actively engage with the work of the University.
That sentiment was echoed by Reischauer yesterday.
“It was highly desirable to have an individual who was in the Boston area and could engage more frequently than those of us who have to get on an airplane do,” Reischauer said.
The selection of the first Asian American to the Corporation marks a milestone in the governing body’s history, and Lee’s appointment comes 10 years after the Corporation selected its first black member, Conrad K. Harper.
Lee will replace long-serving member Houghton, who joined the Corporation in 1995 and in 2002 became its senior fellow—a position members have in the past described as a first among equals.
Lee has served on the Board of Overseers for the past eight years and was a member of the search committee that selected Drew G. Faust as University president in 2007.
A former Adams House resident, Lee has taught courses at Harvard Law School in the past and collaborated on the school’s most recent teaching venture, a problem solving course aimed at reforming the school’s curriculum. His daughter, a 2002 graduate of the College, captained the women’s swimming team.
Lee is currently a co-managing partner of the law firm WilmerHale, one of the nation’s most prestigious law firms, and managed the 2004 merger of the Boston firm Hale and Dorr and the Washington-based Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering.
The Corporation is currently in the midst of an internal governance review that is examining the organization’s operations.
Reischauer, who as incoming senior fellow will take on an increased leadership role after Houghton’s departure, declined to describe the coming period as one of certain change for the Corporation.
“It’s certainly one of consideration of change, but Harvard doesn’t want to jump the gun,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During next year’s January Term, all undergraduates will be allowed to return to campus eight days before classes begin, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced Friday.
The College will be closed to students from Dec. 22 to Jan. 15, 2011, but the campus will reopen on Jan. 16—approximately a week before second semester classes commence, according to Hammonds’s statement, which was sent to the undergraduate community.
In contrast to this year’s J-Term—when students without explicit approval were not permitted to stay on campus for any part of the period—all undergraduates will be able to return to Harvard about a week before classes begin on Jan. 24.
“We heard a lot from students and from various offices that [the beginning of the spring semester] was rushed,” Hammonds said. “It seemed like people needed a bit more time to come back in and settle down.”
During the last eight days of next year’s J-Term, all campus facilities—such as dining halls, shuttles, gyms, and libraries—will operate on a normal term-time basis.
The administration is hoping to facilitate student group-initiated programming during that week-long period.
As was the case last year, students with specific needs—including varsity athletes, international students, thesis writers, and students conducting lab-based research—will be able to apply for permission to stay on campus during the first three and a half weeks, according to the statement.
Before the announcement was made, student groups such as the Institute of Politics and the Phillips Brooks House Association had articulated a desire to organize their own events during J-Term. The Undergraduate Council had also released a January Term position paper in February advocating student group-initiated programming, which included detailed proposals for structured activities from approximately 30 student groups.
UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 called the announcement a “step in the right direction” for J-Term.
“It’s incredibly exciting that student programming is going to be a reality this January,” he said. “That’s what we’ve been pushing for, what students have wanted since J-Term first became a possibility.”
Hammonds also hinted that there may be limited College-sponsored programming during J-Term, including more social events in the Houses and workshops from the Office of Career Services.
The College administration is planning to build an online portal for next year’s J-Term, which will host the application for housing. The portal will also list all programming taking place on campus during the month-long period and provide resources to help off-campus students find internships and other opportunities, Hammonds said.
In addition to the categories of students permitted on campus for the entirety of J-Term last year, Hammonds said there might be room for a few more arts groups to stay in residence, though she noted that the number of students allowed to stay will continue to be restrained by the capacity of Annenberg Hall, the only dining hall that will be open during the restricted period.
The longer winter vacation was created as part of the University’s calendar reform, which took effect this academic year. Though originally touted as a unique opportunity to offer interesting programming for students, the administration announced last spring that the College would offer no programming and limited housing for the 2010 J-Term in light of budgetary constraints.
Hammonds said she felt the inaugural J-Term this past winter was successful overall, based on the feedback she received from an undergraduate survey, a faculty survey, and reports from all College offices.
“There’s room for improvement, and we’re trying to take that very seriously,” she said. “We’re still living in a period of [financial] uncertainty.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The overwhelming majority of undergraduates spent this past January Term with family and friends, using the time to exercise, relax, and catch up on sleep, according to a survey conducted by the College administration to evaluate the inaugural month-long winter break.
After announcing the College’s logistics and programming for the upcoming January Term last Friday, administrators provided The Crimson with part of the results of a student survey they conducted to evaluate the first J-Term.
The student survey data—which had a response rate of 42.3 percent—along with the results of a survey of faculty members and reports from various offices within the College, was used to determine the plans for next year’s J-Term, according to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
“We did the surveys because we wanted to hear directly from students what the experience was like for them,” she said. “They became one piece of the assessment.”
Hammonds wrote in the announcement that the College’s decision on J-Term 2011—which will be similar to J-Term 2010, except that all undergraduates will be welcome back on campus eight days before the start of the spring semester—was partially motivated by the undergraduate survey, which she said indicated “students’ overwhelming satisfaction” with the inaugural J-Term.
According to the survey, 97 percent of students polled reported that they visited family and friends, and 85 percent said they were able to relax and catch up on sleep.
“It was clear that students were happy to have time to relax and rest while on campus, or to pursue opportunities away from Cambridge,” she wrote in the statement.
The survey also offers a picture of how the estimated 1,000 students allowed to stay at Harvard used available resources and what they thought about their on-campus experiences.
Almost three-quarters of respondents said they went to Annenberg—the only dining hall that was open during J-Term—often or very often, while 10 percent said they never went to Annenberg.
Nearly half of students who remained on campus listed the location of Annenberg Hall as a problem. The next most common complaint, cited by 15 percent of on-campus students, was that they missed having a social group and felt lonely.
In response to this concern, Houses will be organizing more social events during J-Term for students who remain at Harvard, according to Hammonds’s announcement to the College.
Despite the complaints, Annenberg Hall, which has the largest serving capacity of any of the undergraduate dining halls, will still be the only dining hall open next January until all students are allowed to return, according to Hammonds.
She added that the College is working to respond to cases of student dissatisfaction in other areas.
“For example, students said the Hemenway Gym was packed. We’re working hard to have the [Malkin Athletic Center] open,” Hammonds said.
Three percent of students surveyed said they wished the MAC had been open during the break, while eight percent of students on campus complained about the lack of programming or things to do.
Next year, the College will allow students to return eight days before classes start, in part so that they can participate in student-initiated programming. During this period, all campus facilities—such as dining halls, shuttles, gyms, and libraries—will operate on a normal term-time basis.
The College also compiled approximately 270 pages of qualitative student responses which were not released due to privacy concerns.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Managing a room full of rowdy children—all between 9 and 11 years old—on a hot Thursday afternoon may seem like the work of a trained professional, but as Mission Hill After School Program volunteer E. Jordan Taylor ’12 steps into the classroom on the Wentworth Institute of Technology campus, she transforms from student to disciplinarian without missing a beat.
Taylor has been a volunteer with the all-student-run MHASP since her freshman year, and her confidence in directing the restless students shows.
“I need everyone’s eye contact right now,” Taylor announces, raising her right hand. “I’m going to wait until I have 100 percent attention.”
Climbing atop tables and screaming at each other, Taylor’s students refuse to attend to her lesson plan for the day.
One of the students even talks back to Taylor, accusing her of not being “nice” while marching around the classroom with her hand raised in mockery.
“There are days like this, and days when they are complete angels,” Taylor says of her students’ raucous behavior.
DIVIDE AND CONQUER
Of the Phillips Brooks House Association’s 17 after school programs, MHASP is the oldest and largest, founded in 1983 and currently comprised of 180 volunteers.
The program provides three-and-a-half hours of after school activities and tutoring for 63 elementary and middle school students from two of Boston’s housing developments, Mission Main and Alice Taylor.
Based on the WIT campus, the Mission Hill program is run mainly by students from Harvard and Wellesley, with a few volunteers from other Boston-area colleges.
The program runs four days a week, with college volunteers alternating on the different school days.
“If you don’t come to the program, you just stay at home and play games. If you come to the program, you have fun and do homework like this,” one elementary school-aged Mission Hill participant says, snapping his fingers to indicate how efficiently he could complete work at MHASP.
A large part of Mission Hill’s success and longevity is a result of the large-scale coordination between hundreds of college volunteers and kids from the neighboring communities and the program’s well-established schedule of daily activities.
Each Mission Hill child is paired with a college volunteer who assists them with homework, reads aloud to them, and plays games with them.
MHASP itself is headed by four student directors, each responsible for a different aspect of curriculum planning and program management.
The sheer number of volunteers—MHASP strives for a one-on-one ratio between college volunteers and Mission Hill kids for every day—has contributed to the program’s longevity and continued strong presence in the world of after school volunteer programs.
TAKING A LOOK BACK
Despite being around for nearly three decades, MHASP has faced difficulties evaluating the efficacy and progress of its after school programs.
“Evaluation of the program is a really big challenge in terms of who does that and finding people who are experienced in that area,” says Mission Hill School Principal Ayla Gavins, whose students participate in MHASP. “It is a huge amount of coordination and communication.”
Over the past few years, PBHA has been trying to conduct evaluations of its programs through the Survey of After-School Youth Outcomes assessment forms, which are distributed to programs at the beginning and end of each year to trace annual progress.
The SAYO forms—part of a federally funded evaluation program—are meant to touch upon homework progress, engagement in learning, and relationships with peers in each student who participates in an after school program like Mission Hill.
Because the final evaluations compiled by the PBHA lump together eight after school programs, it is impossible to single out individual programs’ results.
“We didn’t really do data collection [before]; we’ve always had anecdotal data,” PBHA Student Development Coordinator Ariel B. Harms ’04 says. “We agree that hard data makes it easier to make changes, [but] it’s not something we’ve been doing.”
Stacey Guerrero ’10, one of the program’s two administrative directors, adds that Mission Hill has had trouble following its progress just on paper surveys.
“We need a more systematic way of doing follow-up,” she says.
As for now, verbal feedback and informal volunteer reports indicate that kids involved in the program seem to be showing improvement, Guerrero says.
AN ADDICTION, SOME ATTRITION
While other students find community in final clubs, sororities, or even study groups, Katherine E. Varney ’10 and her roommates became engrossed in public service, particularly Mission Hill.
“You get into the program because you inevitably know someone who is doing it, and once you meet the kids, it’s hard not to come back,” says Varney, whose roommate recommended the program. By her senior year, four out of the eight members of her blocking group had signed on as MHASP volunteers.
“With that comes this culture of ‘we do service because we love it and we think it is fantastic,’” Guererro says. “Everyone we hire is super dedicated, and that trickles down.”
But because MHASP is run entirely by college students, it still struggles with the pitfalls of rapid volunteer and leadership turnover.
The name recognition of Mission Hill helps draw in a consistent and sufficient number of volunteers each year, overcoming the attrition problems facing many other volunteer organizations. But the rapid transitions of volunteers and leadership runs the risk of blurring the institutional history of the program.
Eric M. Sefton ’10, a Mission Hill administrative director last year, has recently begun to contact Harvard graduates who volunteered with MHASP, with the intent of developing a database of survey results and contact information to use in the future.
“Graduates have a lot to contribute to the program and the experience of current volunteers,” he says. “It’s also always nice to see who comes before you and see what resources they can bring to the table.”
COLLABORATION, COMMUNITY
MHASP helps maintain the size of its program through collaboration with other established public service programs at Harvard, but also through extensive recruitment of volunteers outside of Harvard.
Out of 180 MHASP volunteers, 75 come from other universities in the Boston area, such as Boston University and Northeastern.
The program has also reached out to other PBHA-affiliated programs to make sure its kids do not lose all mentoring opportunities either over the summer or when they outgrow the program.
MHASP maintains particularly strong relationships with Mission Hill Summer and Mission Mentor programs. According to MHASP Clientele Director Max R. Selver ’11, many MHASP volunteers choose to also work for Mission Hill Summer, and, consequently, many kids participate in both programs.
Many of the children too old for MHASP often move on to Mission Mentor.
“We are very institutionalized,” Selver says. “People understand our legitimacy.”
The involvement of the parents of kids participating in MHASP keeps the program deeply ingrained in the Boston community.
According to Selver, parents meet with the coordinators at the beginning of the school year to discuss goals for their children, and progress reports for each child are sent home in the middle of the semester.
More fun-oriented Mission Hill traditions, such as a final party and a sleepover at Harvard, exemplify the high level of trust bestowed upon MHASP by the community.

At about 1:30 a.m. yesterday morning, residents of New Quincy were jarred from their sleep—or from their Saturday night partying—by the blaring of a fire alarm.
Christine M. Baugh '10, who lives on the sixth floor of New Quincy, opened her door and said she found that "everything was white.”
“The air was white. You couldn't see very far in front of your face,” she said. “It didn't smell like smoke. Nothing was warm. It was just very, very white."
As startled occupants of the building made their way outside, word began to spread: There was no fire. Rather, someone had emptied a fire extinguisher in the hallway of New Quincy's sixth floor.
Some of the students crashed in a friend's room for the night. Those who waited—first outdoors and then in the Junior Common Room—were allowed back to the sixth floor by 4 a.m.
Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke sent an e-mail to students yesterday morning stating that all dust in the hallway had been cleared away but that the removal of remaining dust in students' rooms was their responsibility.
"The smoke—or whatever it was—came into everyone's rooms," Baugh said. "We're doing our best to clean it up."
The dust, monoaluminum phosphate, is not toxic, but Quincy House Allston Burr Resident Dean Judith F. Chapman said that it might pose a problem for two students with asthma who she said live on the floor.
"I suggested that one of them sleep in the infirmary tonight," Chapman said, adding that it might be necessary for the students to sleep in unoccupied rooms elsewhere on campus until the dust is completely eliminated from New Quincy.
Chapman said that the fire extinguisher was not released accidentally, since the entire content of the canister was expelled into the hallway. She said she has not heard any information from students about who might have triggered the extinguisher but added that she hopes to "be able to hold them accountable."
The Administrative Board's suggested punishment for tampering with fire safety equipment, Chapman said, is disciplinary probation. She said she has seen three such cases, none of them in Quincy, in her five years as a resident dean.
"If they catch him or her, they should make them clean up all the rooms," opined Kirkland resident Gil S. Weintraub '10.
Quincy resident Marcelo Cerullo '10 said he had heard a rumor that someone set off the fire extinguisher in order to break up a fight in the hallway.
Chapman said that since the perpetrator was "probably a guest of someone hosting one of the parties" held in New Quincy last night, she has suggested to the House Masters that no registered parties be allowed in the House "for a while, until someone takes responsibility for it."
Gehrke's e-mail, which described the incident as "a very serious and malicious act," said that the Cambridge Fire Department called the mess "the worst they have ever seen."
Gehrke wrote that the cost of the cleanup, which is substantial but undetermined, will likely fall to the House and may cause Quincy to cut some social activities from its already strained budget.
"I'm angry, I'm angry, I'm angry," said Chapman. "It's so destructive to the community. Maybe it was ignorance. Now everyone who reads The Crimson will know: Don't play with the fire extinguisher."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard students are busy writing papers and taking midterms, only wishing they could be somewhere else, freshman field hockey standout Kim Goh has been playing field hockey under the Argentinean sun and exploring the streets of Buenos Aires.
Goh will return to campus this week after a trip to Argentina with the U.S. Women's Under-19 National Team. In February, she joined her future U19 teammates for a three-day training camp at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif., near San Diego. Goh and her teammates then returned to their respective homes and schools for just over a month before meeting up again for an international tour in Argentina.
On April 4th, the 17-member U19 squad traveled to Buenos Aires after two days of training at the University of Maryland. In their first round of play, the American women topped the Argentineans, 2-1. The team got off to a slow start in the first half, and Argentina grabbed the early lead on a penalty corner. But the U.S. team came out with a vengeance in the second half and scored twice to pull out the win.
Unfortunately, the team dropped its next two games, first in a rematch against the Argentineans, 3-0, then in a 5-0 decision with the GEBA, one of the top club teams in Argentina. The GEBA squad carries seven Olympians on its roster, including the six-time FIH Player of the World Luciana Aymar. Although Aymar did not play due to injury, the depth of GEBA’s bench provided plenty of competition for the Americans. Goh and her U.S. teammates wrote in an online blog that “the match was a great learning experience of hockey on a high international level.”
Goh and her teammates put everything they learned in their first three games out on the field in their last match against Banfield Club, trouncing their final opponent, 5-0. Though the U.S. team went 2-2 in competition while in Argentina, Goh now can draw on a wealth of international experience when she returns to Harvard.
Goh plays midfield and at the back position for the Crimson. The rookie started all 17 games this season and was credited with one defensive save.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Nur N. Ibrahim ’13 visited her Culture and Belief class’s art exhibit last week, she found herself surrounded by God—the letters of Allah’s name, that is, depicted using everything from DNA helices to Solo cups.
The projects on display in the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Islamic Studies Program Office were created by the 55 students in Culture and Belief 12, “For the Love of God and His Prophet: Religion, Literature, and the Arts in Muslim Culture.”
The class’s professor, Associate Director of the Islamic Studies Program Ali S. Asani ’77, said that creating this course would have been impossible without the freedom granted by the Program in General Education, which encourages creative assignments and interdisciplinary learning.
Islamic culture is most commonly studied through a social or political lens, Asani said, both of which are premised on the idea of Islam as “the other.”
“I think this approach, through the arts, is a very effective way of humanizing Muslim experiences,” Asani said.
Asani has been designing the course for nearly a decade, but he said when he presented it under the Core seven or eight years ago it was rejected twice.
When Gen Ed was adopted, the situation reversed, he said. After enthusiastically approving the course, the Gen Ed Office began to actively support it by funding art supplies and events, such as a visit from a Sufi rock musician.
Under the Core, every course was required to have a final exam, but General Education encourages professors to consider creative alternatives.
“The literature on learning shows that hands-on activities can help some students learn and integrate the material better,” said Associate Dean of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen.
For the first project, which is now on display, students learned from Asani, professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic religion and culture, to write “Allah” in Arabic script and were told to represent a concept associated with God in the Islamic tradition through any media.
One student transcribed “Allah” onto a light bulb to demonstrate the idea that light is filtered through the word of Allah. Other projects included decoupage, masks, and a collage of images ranging from Homer Simpson to spiritual symbols.
Over 60 people, including University President Drew G. Faust and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, attended the opening, said Islamic Studies Program Administrator Clifford Gardner.
For the second project, students designed modern-day mosques showcased through models or videos, while the final project will involve writing a love lyric or narrative epic based on Persian and Arabic examples.
Ibrahim said that while the open-ended nature of the assignments can be stressful, it allows students to form their own opinions about what they are learning.
The exhibit will be up for at least another week, Gardner said.
“Usually people don’t want to share a term paper with their family,” Asani said. “But when you create art, it has to be shared.”

CORRECTION: April 12, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 12 news article "Gen Ed Promotes Creative Classwork" incorrectly stated that Professor of German Art and Culture Jeffrey F. Hamburger taught students to write "Allah" in Arabic script. In fact, Associate Director of the Islamic Studies Program Ali S. Asani ’77 showed the students how to write in calligraphy.

During her first game of “Assassins” last year, Sarah T. Yang ’10 and her roommate waited for six hours in a dumpster to ambush her target as he left the dining hall. “It was great for me and my roommate,” Yang said. “We hadn’t spent that much alone time together in a long time.”
Her experience encapsulates both the perks and hassles of “Assassins,” a game that can be stressful and time-consuming but nonetheless encourages community and House bonding.
“Basically you get to know the people in your House really well because you’re going to be stalking them and following them everywhere,” said Yang, one of the organizers of this year’s “Assassins.”
“Assassins” also serves as an outlet for roommate aggression. “People really enjoy killing their blockmates,” says Amy Rosenthal ’11, Currier House “Assassins” coordinator.
Ari R. Hoffman ’10, a past participant in the Hillel games, attributes their popularity to escapism.
“People need a distraction, a way to take their frustration out,” he said, “an illusion that they’re some kind of secret agent.”
Each participating House has a different take on the game. Generally at Harvard, players sign up in teams, oftentimes with creative names like Quincy’s “Sprinklywinks” or “Blood, Bath, and Beyond.” Each player is assigned a target person whom they must “assassinate” within a fixed time period with a false weapon (Harvard’s is usually a water gun). Players’ rooms and dining halls are typically designated “safe zones,” but targets may be required to expose themselves at least once a day. Over the years, many Harvard players have created additional rules, such as the now-repealed “streets are safe but sidewalks are not” rule and the “naked people are safe, but not from other naked people” rule, which has led to much impromptu stripping. The last assassin alive wins.
“In the end, I think what makes Quincy Assassins so successful is the fact that everyone's willing to put 100 percent into it,” said Yang. “A lot of students see the long list of rules as a giant opportunity to think outside the box.”
Yang said that last year, she was impressed by many players’ inventiveness and drive to achieve victory.
“The winning team last year toted a climbing mat as a melee weapon before their guns arrived, and one agent got five kills by using a foam finger,” she said. “So yeah, it's the best game ever. Period.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball and softball teams showed their muscle at the plate on Saturday, racking up 36 runs in four games, but the squads also put their strongest muscle on display: the heart.
Softball and baseball teamed up over the weekend to sponsor Friends of Jaclyn Day, an event focused on increasing awareness of pediatric brain tumors through FOJ—an organization that pairs collegiate and high school teams with children suffering from cancer.
Both teams have been actively involved with FOJ all season. Baseball adopted new three-year-old teammate Alex Wawrzyniak, who has attended a number of practices and contributed a teddy bear that the team keeps in the dugout. Softball coach Brandi Gordon serves on the board of the organization, striving to pair Boston teams with local children. FOJ Day was one of Gordon’s efforts to get her own team more involved.
“For our team, even though we don’t have a kid, it means a lot to us,” said sophomore pitcher Julia Moore, who helped to organize the event along with classmate Eve Rosenbaum. “It’s very meaningful for us to have an event without being fully involved in the program yet—it shows how much we admire the program and the Murphy family [whose daughter, Jaclyn, was FOJ’s first adoptee].”
The day-long event featured activities throughout the baseball and softball doubleheaders against Penn, including trivia between innings, dizzy bat races, T-shirts on sale, and a raffle for Red Sox tickets—all of which raised awareness, in addition to over $1,000.
The softball players also donned purple ribbons in support of FOJ.
“The ribbons are fun,” Moore said. “All of us wanted to show our support. It was also big for us because we were playing Ivy games, but I think [FOJ Day] gave it a little bit of an extra edge.”
While the organization continues to work to expand its reach, events like the one on Saturday help to raise awareness about FOJ and will hopefully facilitate more matches in the future. The softball team is one of over 1,000 teams across the country on the FOJ waitlist and hopes to be able to adopt a Boston-area child in the near future.
“We really want to have this event every year, especially as we get closer to having a kid of our own to adopt,” Moore said.

The colorful lawn chairs that debuted last fall in Harvard Yard will return tomorrow to yet again help promote awkward conversation and new potential for “I Saw You Harvard” posts—oh, and also community building and musical chair competitions.
In an e-mail to the class of 2013 last Friday, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67 announced the return of the chairs, writing, “I trust that they will again contribute to your relaxation and serve a nice community-building function.”
Those bright, colorful lawn chairs have had a positive impact in helping create a social space, according to Susan Shefte, director for planning, analytics, and business services at Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services.
While 476 chairs and 82 tables came to the Yard and Science Center area during the fall along with performances and fanfare, the spring initiative will be “on a more limited basis” due to the events taking place in the Yard over the coming weeks, including ArtsFirst and Commencement, Shefte said.
“Fall is when the most happens around this project,” she said. “It’s when people are starting classes rather than going into exams.”
The chairs will be placed near Grays and Holworthy Halls, Dudley Café, and right outside the Queen Head’s Pub, according to Anthony J. Pacillo, senior manager of Harvard Yard and freshman dormitories.
The chairs are to remain in the Yard until mid-May when they will be removed for Commencement, according to Pacillo and Shefte. They are expected to be put out again for summer session and the fall term.
“It’ll develop, change and grow with each semester,” Shefte said, adding that her office and the others involved in the project are very open to suggestions and are “always looking for new ideas.”

About an hour ago, the 10:40 p.m. shuttle to the Quad got into a minor accident on Massachussetts Avenue, right across from the Holyoke Center.
Minutes after pulling away from the Boylston Gate stop, the shuttle attempted to change lanes when it swerved to the left, seemingly to avoid hitting a pickup truck on its right side.
This FlyBy correspondent, who happened to be on the shuttle when the accident happened, barely noticed an impact. But before we knew it, both the shuttle and the truck had pulled over to the side of the street. The shuttle driver instructed the passengers to exit the vehicle and wait for the next bus.
We didn't notice any damage to the shuttle, but the driver of the other vehicle showed us that his truck was somewhat scratched on the left side.
The shuttle driver, as well as the HUPD and Cambridge Police officers present, declined to comment.
