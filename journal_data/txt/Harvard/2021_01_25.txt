After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2020 was a year of record-breaking voter turnout. Two-thirds of registered voters in the U.S. cast ballots for president – the highest percentage in 120 years. And over the summer, 43,531 Harvard alumni voted in Harvard University’s Board of Overseers election — the highest total in recent memory — after robust get-out-the-vote efforts by the grassroots Harvard Forward campaign. But even in the best of years, turnout in Harvard’s elections is pitifully low: this modern-day “record” represented roughly 15 percent turnout.
Harvard alumni are a highly-educated electorate who know the importance of civic engagement. So why don’t they vote in Harvard’s elections? Because they’re convinced these elections don’t matter.
We’ve heard alumni say they receive the ballot every year and throw it away because they know nothing meaningful about the Board of Overseers or the candidates. Unlike public elections, Harvard elections are devoid of debates and town halls, and it’s a challenge for alumni to learn about the candidates’ visions for the University. Furthermore, once elected, the Overseers have little interaction with the general alumni population — there’s little transparency, no clear channels of communication, and virtually no engagement with the broader Harvard community. And since most years every Overseer is hand-picked by the Harvard Alumni Association, alumni think it doesn’t matter who ultimately wins election to the Board.
We disagree.
Overseers hold real influence over the direction of the University. In addition to providing academic oversight and general strategic guidance, the Overseers have the power to accept or reject new appointments to the Harvard Corporation, which in turn handles the endowment and many executive functions of the University. The fights for racial justice and climate action cut across every facet of the University, from curricula, to research priorities, to financial investments, all of which the Board of Overseers has the ability to shape. Beyond its charter-granted powers, the board and its members have direct access to the University president and the rest of the administration. The ability to be in the right room at the right time can change the outcome of discussions for the better.
The past year has shown that we’re facing unprecedented, intersecting challenges that require moral leadership and bold action from Harvard if we hope to maintain our claim to being a leading global institution. New challenges require a new type of leadership. Backgrounds in global public health, higher education, climate policy, and racial justice will prove crucial to the Board as Harvard navigates the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century. Furthermore, Board seats should not be seen as a goal in itself, but rather as an opportunity to chart a better future for the University. Being stewards of the University is not a passive role. It requires proactive, visionary leadership, not just upholding the status quo. Inclusive, bold leadership from members of the Board of Overseers today will make Harvard a better place for decades to come. That’s why it matters who wins the elections to sit on the Board.
Alumni should care about electing people who are passionate about holding the University to its highest ideals, and this election is the only way for most alumni — aside from major donors — to influence the University’s direction. In Harvard’s governance structure, only overseers are truly democratically elected; the University president and members of the Corporation are all appointed by a handful of executives.
However, these elected overseers are almost always chosen by the Harvard Alumni Association. In the past, HAA-selected candidates have been discouraged from discussing their stances on issues. Elections focus on their past accomplishments, not their vision for the future, and rarely center around a commitment to advance pressing matters voiced by the Harvard community. But other alumni prepared to bring diverse perspectives and new leadership can make it on the ballot if they collect enough signatures — 2,987 this year.
The high barrier to entry means that petition candidates must care enough about Harvard to work hard to make it on the ballot. They must have a compelling reason that resonates with thousands of alumni, and they must connect with the Harvard community to gather support. We believe this process makes petition candidates particularly strong contenders, and the three of us are proud to be running by petition.
It’s time to elect overseers who are passionate about advocating for issues of climate action, racial justice, inclusive governance, and socially-responsible investing — exactly the work we do in our day-to-day professional lives. We’re running for the Board of Overseers because we envision a Harvard where our elected leaders reflect our community’s values and advocate for change when it matters. Those who agree with us can support our candidacies by submitting their nominations before Feb. 3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and longstanding issues such as an affordable housing shortage, Cambridge residents remain confident in the city government’s leadership, according to a recent survey.
The findings originate from the biennial City of Cambridge Resident Telephone Survey, conducted by Polity Research Consulting. Using a sample size of 400 randomly selected adult residents, the survey was conducted in September 2020 and published in October. The City Manager’s Office released the study results for public view during Jan. 4 City Council meeting.
Even during a global pandemic, the 2020 data indicates improvement from the last survey, which was released in 2018. Overall satisfaction with city services is at a 20-year high, rising to 60 percent from 55 percent in 2018.
“I believe this reflects our highly capable and extremely dedicated workforce and the focus they place on the initiatives and priorities of the Council,” City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said in a Jan. 4 press release. “I want to thank City staff for their commitment to our community and for their hard work.”
The 2020 version of the survey included a new slate of questions relating to the coronavirus pandemic. When asked if they thought the city’s response to Covid-19 was effective, 81 percent of respondents agreed. Thirty-eight percent labeled the response “excellent” and 43 percent said it was “good.”
About three-quarters of the sample stated that they followed public health Covid-19 guidelines “a lot.” Nineteen percent said they follow “some” of the guidelines. Five percent answered that they follow guidelines to a lesser degree.
For information on the pandemic, respondents overwhelmingly indicated that they trust the state government and Cambridge City officials more than the federal government. Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they trust the Massachusetts State government the most when it comes to Covid-19, while 24 percent rely on the city government. Twenty-six percent of those surveyed said that the state and local government responses are equally trustworthy. Just four percent said they trust the federal government the most.
Job security among residents has been heavily affected by the pandemic. Thirty-two percent of respondents reported some loss of employment in their household since the beginning of pandemic lockdowns in March.
According to the survey, Cambridge residents of color experienced disproportionate job loss during the pandemic. Forty-five percent of African American respondents reported some loss of employment, which is thirteen percentage points higher than the overall rate among respondents. Sixty-four percent of Hispanic respondents also experienced some form of job loss, twice the overall rate.
Despite the pandemic, the most important issue facing the city is the lack of affordable housing, according to those surveyed. When asked about access to affordable housing, just one percent of residents described it as “excellent.” Thirty percent indicated that affordable housing is the issue affecting them most, as well as the top issue they want the city to address. Covid-19, however, was seen by 17 percent of respondents as the most critical.
The Cambridge City Council passed a long-debated affordable housing overlay zoning petition last fall that streamlines the permitting process for units that are deemed 100 percent affordable.
DePasquale and other city officials hope to incorporate the survey findings into actionable policy, according to the release.
“I expect to work closely with City departments to further analyze the results to incorporate relevant insights into priorities and future work plans, and the overall budget process,” DePasquale said. “I anticipate that the survey results will be a valuable tool for the Council and the public to understand community issues.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Government department is reviving a lecture course on women in American politics for the spring semester, responding to a recommendation from its 2019 report on departmental culture.
The class, Government 1312: “Women in US Politics,” will be taught by lecturer Sparsha Saha. The course centers around the causes and effects of gender inequality in politics, the workforce, and the household.
In 2018, following multiple allegations of sexual harassment against former Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez, the department commissioned a “climate report” on gender and racial inequalities in its community and curriculum.
The final report, issued in 2019, found that “courses on race, immigration, identity, and gender politics are in high demand, yet largely missing from our offerings.” The report recommended that the department hire one new faculty member specializing in gender politics and one faculty member specializing in race and ethnicity.
Nara Dillon, Director of Undergraduate Studies in the department, wrote in an email that the climate report’s recommendation was a reason behind the decision to revive the class.
“In 2019, our department Climate Change Committee recommended diversifying the curriculum to include more courses on gender, race, and ethnicity,” Dillon wrote. “This new course on Women in Politics is one element in that effort, and we hope that both the course and the overall effort will continue in future years.”
The department previously offered two higher-level seminars on women in U.S. politics, but neither was a large lecture course nor have they been offered in several years.
Saha previously taught an expository writing course at the College on sexism and politics, but is new to Government 1312, which has not been offered previously.
Saha said that she hopes to examine women’s place in politics nationally as well as gender dynamics within Harvard’s Government department.
“Let’s look at our own department, you know, why do you have so few tenured female professors?” Saha said. “And it’s relevant to politics because this is the study of politics.”
Nine of the 34 tenured faculty in the Government department are women, according to its website.
Dillon said the course’s public engagement component — offered in conjunction with the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship — will allow students to go beyond the classroom and work “with and for women politicians and organizations that are trying to get more women in politics.”
“Students will be scattered all over the place and they won't be right here in Massachusetts,” Dillon said. “But we're hoping to keep as much of that going as possible and then hope to build on that in the future, because we do have a lot of women politicians here in Massachusetts.”
Government chair Jeffry A. Frieden said that he believes Government 1312’s focus on women provides insights that are necessary for a “good, well-rounded understanding of politics more broadly.”
“Women are more than half of society, so clearly understanding women’s participation in politics is absolutely central to understanding politics in every society,” Frieden said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard denied a grievance filed by its graduate student union regarding the exclusion of 108 Population Health Sciences students from the union's bargaining unit.
The University issued the decision on Jan. 6 in response to the grievance filed by Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers on Dec. 3. The union alleged in the Step One grievance — the first stage in the grievance process per its contract with the University — that the exclusion violated multiple articles in their contract that define the bargaining unit and rights and protections associated with union membership.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard administrators have determined Population Health Sciences students are only in the HGSU-UAW bargaining unit when they receive additional compensation for teaching and research duties, beyond their program stipend.
“After careful review and consistent with the other social science graduate degree programs across the university, the University determined that HSPH Population Health students are only employed by the University, and therefore in the HGSU-UAW bargaining unit, when they have additional teaching or research appointments for which they receive compensation above and beyond their stipend,” he wrote.
The Office of Labor and Employee Relations granted the union an extension until Feb. 18 for filing a Step Two grievance with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, according to HGSU-UAW Communications Committee co-chair Emily M. Wright.
The union requested the extension after Acting Director of Population Health Sciences Tyler J. VanderWeele announced on Jan. 15 to all program students an administrative change to funding for Population Health Sciences students who have teaching duties per program requirements, Wright wrote. The change will make the funding structure for Population Health Sciences students more similar to social science programs in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, according to VanderWeele.
“I am hopeful that the new PhD funding model, that I have been working on with the School and that was formally approved earlier this month, will not only provide 5th year funding for students but also, because of the restructuring of stipend payments and union eligibility, also partially resolve some of the current disputes,” VanderWeele wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
Following the program’s announcement, the union filed a second information request on Jan. 19 with Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench and School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams to inquire about details of the new funding model and its implications for Population Health Sciences students. GSAS administers Population Health Sciences, but SPH houses the program.
Wright wrote in an emailed statement that union members will use the extension and information request to investigate how best to move forward with their Step Two grievance following VanderWeele’s announcement.
“With the very recent announcement of this change to how PHS [student workers] providing teaching services are paid last Friday, we are also focusing on gathering more information about this new change and how it will shape our case moving forward,” Wright wrote in the emailed statement.
The dispute began more than three months ago when HGSU-UAW filed the first official information request on Oct. 6 after noticing that dues were not being deducted in the paychecks of several SPH students. A month later, the union noticed 108 Population Health Sciences students were missing from the University’s list of eligible bargaining unit members on Nov. 12, prompting the initial grievance.
If the Step Two grievance is filed, University and union officials will meet, and Garber will issue a determination on the grievance. If both parties cannot reach a resolution, the union can pursue third-party arbitration in Step Three.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College Board will permanently eliminate the SAT Subject Tests or SAT with essay to better adapt to the pandemic-era admissions process, the company announced last Tuesday.
“As students and colleges adapt to new realities and changes to the college admissions process, the College Board is making sure our programs adapt with them,” the statement reads. “The pandemic accelerated a process already underway at the College Board to reduce and simplify demands on students.”
While the tests have been canceled for students registered in the U.S., College Board will continue to administer the Subject Tests — exams that assess specific topics, such as Chemistry, World History, or French — and SAT with essay to international students through June 2021.
Jay R. Rosner, executive director of the Princeton Review Foundation, described the use of the SAT Subject Tests and SAT essay in college admissions as “steadily diminishing.”
“The deaths of both the essay and subject tests are several years overdue,” Rosner wrote. “Harvard will eventually see the light and jettison the SAT, but maybe not without a fight.”
Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane said the Admissions Office will still review all test materials submitted by applicants.
“Harvard admission officers review all material that an applicant submits, so if a student has already taken Subject Tests or the essay portion of the SAT, they may still submit it along with their other application materials,” Dane wrote.
Harvard College — along with its peer institutions — removed standardized test requirements for this year’s application cycle given the challenge of scheduling tests with Covid-19 restrictions.
Brian Taylor, managing director of private college consulting service Ivy Coach, said College Board’s decision was "entirely predictable."
“This was an entirely predictable move by College Board,” Taylor said. “When certain elite schools make a move, other universities soon thereafter follow their lead. College Board read the writing on the wall.”
In eliminating the SAT Subject Tests, College Board could make AP exams — end-of-course tests offered by the same company — more profitable, Taylor speculated.
“AP exams are already hugely important in highly selective college admissions,” Taylor wrote. “This move by College Board hammers home their importance.”
“These exams, which went online last year, are also more of a revenue driver for College Board,” he added. “Each test costs test-takers around $95, whereas SAT Subject Tests cost test-takers around $26.”
Conner M. Huey, an admitted student to the Class of 2025, had taken one SAT Subject Test, but not the SAT due to the limited availability of testing centers. He wrote in an email that he had “mixed feelings” about the removal of the Subject Tests.
“In a way, it definitely makes college admissions less driven by test scores and more holistic, which I greatly appreciate,” Huey wrote.
“I am concerned, however, that this will lead to increased stress for students since they may feel the need to compensate for what would have been excellent Subject Test scores,” he added. “In a sense, I think by removing the pressure of more standardized tests for students, I believe another pressure has been amplified.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Angela Y. Zhong ’24, a freshman from Cypress, T.X., arrived on campus on Thursday, she anticipated starting her “normal” college experience. Though the College invited freshmen to live in residence last semester, Zhong decided to complete her first semester of college from home.
“I really felt like I was missing out last semester,” Zhong said. “I thought I would petition, and I also just wanted to meet new people."
Students invited to live in residence this semester will encounter a far-from-normal campus experience, which began for many this week with a move-in process modified for the pandemic era.
In December, the College announced that it was expanding spring housing to accommodate 3,100 undergraduates compared to the 25 percent of students who lived in residence during the fall semester. Students living on campus this semester — seniors, enrolled juniors, students with difficult learning environments, and petitioning juniors returning from leaves of absences — began trickling onto campus Wednesday, arriving at pre-assigned times over the course of five days.
Before settling into their dorms, students underwent coronavirus testing and made an account with Color, a health testing company. After testing, students were able to pick up their meals for initial quarantine and their dorm key.
Several students reported mixed experiences moving into their dorms for the spring semester. On one hand, Samyra C. Miller ’21 said her move-in experience was “super easy.”
“I thought it was going to be a long line for testing,” Miller said. Instead, she said she quickly moved through the testing process, which involved showing her completed Crimson Clear symptom attestation, obtaining a test kit, self-administering a test, dropping it off, picking up a bag of pre-packaged Harvard University Dining Services meals, and returning to her house.
On the other hand, Alexa L. Zinke ’23 — a sophomore who moved into Eliot House on Sunday — said the move-in process was “not as smooth” as she anticipated.
“There weren't that many people around to inform or ask questions, and so it took us way longer than it should have to figure out where we were going,” she said. “I even went into Eliot once to see if there was somebody that might be helpful, and there was nobody.”
“During the time we were actually moving in, I don’t think we saw more than maybe one other student moving in,” she added.
Once moved in, undergraduates undergo a mandatory quarantine period until they receive their first negative test. During this period, students are only allowed to leave their rooms to use the bathroom or in the case of emergency.
After receiving a third negative Covid test, students are allowed to socialize in masked pairs and take socially-distanced walks within 30 minutes of campus. Undergraduates will be notified of different phases of campus reopening through a color system, with purple being the most restrictive phase and green being the most permissive.
As of Sunday evening, the College is in Level Orange, indicating that, following their third negative test, students can socialize outside in masked pairs or with suitemates and travel within a 30-minute walking radius of campus.
Despite reports of “Zoom fatigue” from the nature of online classes during the fall, several students expressed excitement about the upcoming spring semester, which begins Monday.
“I’m just super excited to be back,” Miller said. “I have a nice room — got some nice roommates, and I’m ready to just finish my last semester at Harvard, which is crazy to think about.”
Zinke added that she thinks Harvard is “doing the best job that it can.”
“I think that the school gets a lot of criticism from people that don’t really understand the logistics of neither the virus nor the way that universities have to deal with it,” she said. “I’m glad that Harvard is doing what it’s doing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 1960s, Richard N. Cooper rode his bicycle to work every day at the Council of Economic Advisers in Washington, D.C.
The first time Cooper attended a meeting with then-President John F. Kennedy ’40, Kennedy stopped the meeting to ask, “Who is that kid?” upon seeing Cooper, according to Harvard Kennedy School professor Jeffrey A. Frankel, a friend of Cooper’s.
Cooper was “always much younger than his age,” Frankel said.
Though he may have looked young for his age, Cooper — who taught international economics at Harvard starting in 1981 and served in four different U.S. presidential administrations — was a talented economist, public servant, and professor, according to his colleagues.
He died of lymphoma on Dec. 23 at age 86 at his home in Cambridge, his daughter, Laura Cooper, told The Washington Post.
He leaves behind a wife, Jin Chen Cooper, and their two children William C. Cooper ’23 and Jennifer Cooper, in addition to two children from a first marriage, Laura and Mark Cooper.
Cooper was born in Seattle on June 14, 1934 and raised in Greenbelt, Md. Following the end of World War II, his family spent four years in Frankfurt, Germany, where his father – a retired journalist – worked as a political and public affairs officer for the High Commission for Occupied Germany.
A graduate of Oberlin College, Cooper received a master’s degree from the London School of Economics as a Marshall Scholar and a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard in 1962.
While doing dissertation research at the Brookings Institute, Cooper caught the attention of the Kennedy administration, for which he became a senior economist at just age 26.
Under Kennedy, Cooper worked at the Council of Economic Advisors from 1961 to 1963, after which he went on to serve as the President Lyndon Johnson's Assistant Secretary of State for International Monetary Affairs in 1965.
Cooper published his first book, “The Economics of Interdependence: Economic Policy in the Atlantic Community,” in 1968.
Frankel wrote in a blog post that Cooper’s 1968 book set the “original foundation of the study of international cooperation.”
That same international cooperation would play a central role in Cooper’s subsequent positions as Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in the Carter administration, and chair of the National Intelligence Council under President Bill Clinton.
Frankel wrote that Cooper played an important role in devising the renowned “locomotive theory,” which posited that the U.S., Germany, and Japan could use fiscally expansive policies to pull the rest of the world out of the 1974-75 recession.
From 1990 to 1992, Cooper served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
“It’s pretty rare that in your position in Washington you get to affect precisely the same ideas that you worked on academically,” Frankel said.
Cooper’s work was not constrained to policy alone, though. He taught economics at Yale University from 1966 to 1977, serving as provost from 1972 to 1974. In 1981, he joined Harvard’s faculty as the Maurits C. Boas Professor of International Economics.
Cooper bridged the gap between academic theory and real life, according to his colleague, Harvard economics professor Benjamin M. Friedman ’66.
“He always wanted to know how any piece of theory applied to the real world, whether the assumptions behind it were reasonable, and above all what practical implications followed,” Friedman wrote in an email.
Frankel remembers him as a “great moderator” who could “sharpen the discussion.”
“He was always frequently deliberate in making people say exactly what they meant,” Frankel said. “Students saw it at big conferences; I saw it at the dinner table.”

Though you may still be on #holidaymode, you must face the reality that another semester of online learning has commenced. Our laptop screens have replaced the vibrant college life we’ve grown to love — we miss running into acquaintances, enjoying meals with large groups of people, and being a part of a bustling environment. To combat the nostalgia, let’s try to make this semester better than the last and complete a few virtual learning goals. Count how many items you can check off this learning enhancement bucket list!
✓ Set up a virtual study session.
Gone are the days you can pull up to Lamont Library with a study buddy, but now is your chance to stimulate a motivating working environment from wherever you are and break your horrendous, yet wonderful, Netflix binge-watching habit. Reach out to a group of friends, plan a time to get together (please don’t send a When2Meet), and send out a Zoom link. Whether you’re working (read: crying) on the same physics pset or writing completely different essays, don’t underestimate the simple presence of a friend.
✓ Attend office hours.
Pre-Covid-19, it was challenging to go to office hours because of meetings, extracurricular activities, and another million conflicts (“I missed the shuttle!”). However, now you have the opportunity to attend office hours from the comfort of your futon. If that isn’t enough to convince you, remember that the teaching team misses seeing students on a regular basis, so they would love to have a conversation with you even more than usual. Your professor’s advice, perspective, and expertise are only a few clicks away. In case you’re still hesitating, keep in mind that office hours might deter you from spending your whole day on TikTok.
✓ Hop into a random class.
Take advantage of the combination of our world-class education and high-tech era to learn from a new course, whether it’s within your concentration or on the other end of the academic spectrum. Immerse yourself in a specific era of American history, gain more knowledge about evolutionary biology, or learn about Shakespeare — now could be the time to tack on that random pass/fail class that you’ve been looking at since freshman fall! Because of the several different time zones and Zoom fatigue, student attendance rates are probably taking Ludacris’ song “How Low Can You Go” quite literally, so professors would be thrilled to see more people show up (though maybe email first to avoid any accidental Zoom-bombing). Zoom is your oyster!
✓ Go to virtual study breaks.
Whether the study break is planned by your entryway or organization, take some time away from your studies and stop by the event for a few minutes. We know that virtual study breaks aren’t as lively and interactive as in person, but it’s worth seeing different faces besides your professors’ and classmates’ every once in a while. This is a great opportunity for you to catch up with other students in your entryway, play a few games, and perhaps passionately vent about how three midterms in one week should be forbidden.
✓ Change your virtual background to a scenic photo during class.
Sure, airline ticket prices have been pretty low, but changing your virtual background to Machu Picchu, Cancun, or the Grand Canyon only costs you a few seconds. These are all great choices to spice up your backdrop since your lamp can surprisingly get dull, and they are lovely conversation starters during those awkward breakout room moments we are all too aware of. Feeling bold? Use a photo of your professor as your background. If they’re not amused, just zoom out of there real quick and blame it on the “unstable Internet connection.”
Though an online education certainly comes with challenges, there are still ways to stay engaged with faculty and classmates. So grab a few snacks and put on a pair of sweatpants, and you might just learn something new! Challenge your friends to see who can check off all the items on this bucket list first.
