After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mike’s Pastry, the celebrated North End cannoli and sweets shop, can move forward with its plans to open a second location in Harvard Square, after the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal unanimously approved a request to grant the pastry store a fast order food permit at a meeting Thursday evening.
The decision followed a similar vote of approval on Jan. 27 by the city’s Harvard Square Advisory Committee and was the last municipal hurdle for the business to clear.
“Mike’s Pastry is locally owned and family operated,” the shop’s lawyer,  Joseph Hanley, said Thursday. “We’re very excited to bring this concept to the Square.”
Hanley noted that the pastry store offers goods that are currently unavailable in the Square.
Hanley and Mike’s General Manager Angelo Papa presented the board with floor plans and photos of the future storefront space at 11 Dunster St. and responded to questions from the committee about whether the establishment would properly comply with local and state requirements.
Those requirements include demands that the pastry store use biodegradable products and that the building remains compatible with the existing neighborhood.
Papa and Hanley assured the board that the plans for the new Mike’s Pastry met all the prerequisites.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, also spoke on behalf of the establishment, highlighting the excitement the proposed shop  has generated in the Square.
“There’s been a lot of activity on Facebook as well as people tweeting about it,” Jillson said.  “We’re all really looking forward to it.”
The members of the Board of Zoning Appeal, joking that they may need to taste-test Mike’s cannoli, voted unanimously to grant Mike’s Pastry a fast order food permit.
Although Papa noted he was somewhat nervous about appearing before the board, he said that he was very pleased with outcome.
“We’re ecstatic, very happy,” Papa said. “We can’t wait.”
Construction on the Dunster St. location is expected to begin in April. Papa previously said that the shop should open by early summer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Students might have to walk a little farther for their late night burritos once Felipe’s Taqueria, the popular Harvard Square Mexican restaurant, completes its move from Mt. Auburn St. to a new spot two blocks away on Brattle St. 
Although some students may be dismayed by the longer walk, co-owners Thomas J. Brush and Felipe Herrera said they are excited about the benefits presented by the move.
“It’s time for us to move on, and in the natural evolution, we need to move forward and to a better location for us,” Brush said. “The drawback to this [current] location really would be the size of the space—it’s just very difficult to work in such a cramped location.”
Felipe’s new location—the former home of Bertucci’s at 21 Brattle St.—will allow the restaurant to expand its offerings in terms of menu items and customer amenities. New features will include a charcoal grill, furniture built in Mexico, and an expanded menu including enchiladas and seafood. Customers can expect a full selection of alcohol, as long as the licensing process goes smoothly.
“We’ll still have Felipe’s just like this—reasonably priced great food, get in get out—but additionally we want to offer sit-down options,” Brush said. “The way [the new location is] structured right now, we have a main floor, and similar to Crema [Cafe] and Flat Patties, we [will] have a mezzanine. Downstairs, we [will] have the bar area and that will primarily be sit-down.”
Herrera said he was excited to use the expanded space for cooking.
“Finally we’re gonna have a kitchen,” Herrera said.
In addition, according to Brush, patrons may also be able to enjoy their drinks outside.
“We are hoping to get permission to put a roof deck in the new location,” Brush said.
Although the move won’t be completed until around April, the Felipe’s team is already thinking far ahead. Brush said that the owners have signed a 20-year lease for the new location.
“Long term, it’s just a great location for us,” Brush said. “It’ll take some time but people will find us.”
However, Brush did express some reservations about the increased distance between Felipe’s and the heart of Harvard’s undergraduate life.
“It is about two blocks, but still two blocks is two blocks, people gotta move their habits,” Brush said.
The restaurant was packed with customers at midnight on Saturday, many of whom said they would still frequent the Mexican restaurant despite the location change.
“I think Felipe’s has enough of a unique experience with the cultural components it has,” customer Joelle Janigian said. “If people are seeking that, they’ll walk an extra two blocks for it.”
 
“I think if Felipe’s were in Antarctica I’d walk there,” customer Nazri Angel said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A professor central to Harvard’s Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department and known for his wit, humility, and extensive knowledge of Arabic culture died Jan. 23. Wolfhart P. Heinrichs was 72 years old. He is survived by his wife Alma Giese-Heinrichs, three siblings—Dietmar, Hilberg and Ortrud, who live in Germany—extended family, and many friends.
 Yale professor Beatrice Gruendler, who was mentored by Heinrichs, said that his life and death could best be summarized by an old Arabic quotation from the writer Badi’ al-Zaman al-Hamadhani: 
“He was the water and clay of knowledge, he was city and storehouse of erudition, and he died with treasures in his mind not yet unveiled.”
A former student, American University professor Erez Naaman, called Heinrichs a “giant figure” in the field of Arabic studies.
 Born Oct. 3, 1941 in Cologne, Germany, Heinrichs was the son of a university professor of ancient Germanic studies and an Old Norse lecturer. As a young adult, Heinrichs studied English, French, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, learning and teaching in various European universities, particularly in Germany, until 1977, when he was offered a one-year position as visiting lecturer at Harvard.
Soon after, Heinrichs took on a full professorship of Arabic at Harvard, which he held from 1978 until 1995. In 1980, he married Alma Giese, a fellow accomplished scholar who received her doctorate from the University of Giessen the same year. “Both he and his beloved Alma shared in his love of language and literature, which surely was one of the greatest joys of his life,” said colleague William A. Graham, a professor and former dean at Harvard Divinity School. 
Since 1989, Heinrichs wrote 50 academic articles on various topics such as literary criticism, and was co-editor of the Encyclopedia of Islam. In 1996, he became the James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic. 
Heinrichs was known for his encyclopedic knowledge of the Classical Arabic language, culture, and literature, friends and colleagues said, as well as a variety of Neo-Aramaic languages—some near-extinct—including Ṭūrōyo and Senāya. 
In an email, Islamic Studies graduate student Gregory Halaby, a former student of Heinrichs’s, wrote that he was “above all genuine and honest,” possessing such traits as “brilliance, humor, humility, and eccentricity.”
Graham also emphasized Heinrichs’s exceptionally strong character. 
“Wolfhart was the gentlest, kindest, and most generous friend and colleague whom one could wish for,” Graham wrote in an email. “His wide knowledge of seemingly everything was on prime display in his engagement with poetry.”
Many former students remembered Heinrichs’s passion for poetry. Heinrichs composed limericks for each of his graduate students upon completion of their dissertation. Former students said that his limericks were witty, perfectly capturing Heinrichs’s refined sense of humor. Gruendler recounted an incident when Heinrichs, who was correcting a paper, commented on a coffee stain, writing, “Cat spilled coffee and was severely reprimanded.”
NELC graduate student Avigail Noy said she remembered one of her first correspondences with the professor, which included his trademark sense of humor. 
“He said, ‘Every year between zero and four people get in. But if you don’t try you won’t get in for sure,’” Noy said. “So even though he was ‘the’ Professor Heinrichs, it didn’t keep him from encouraging—from the heart—prospective students.” 
Many noted the uncommon effect that Heinrichs’s precise teaching had on students, noting that he was focused on the growth of students without being patronizing. He would personalize exams for students in his philology class, choosing texts that they particularly would enjoy or be challenged by.
 Noy said that perhaps one of the best examples of Heinrichs’s sense of humor was the impossible question that he put on every general exam as a reminder to students of what they did not know. 
 Students also remembered Heinrichs as someone who was never afraid to admit his faults. Another former student, Stanford assistant professor Alexander Key, said that it is extraordinary, “when you’re the global, number one authority in a field and you’re prepared to look your graduate students in the eye and say, ‘I’m going to have to look this word up in another five medieval dictionaries before I can decide what this text means,’” as Heinrichs did.
Gruendler said that when Heinrichs died he had even more knowledge left to offer the world, including unwritten books in his head. Though he had much left to give, friends and colleagues said they will remember him for his love of animals, his generous kindness, and his superb teaching ability.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Feb. 4, 2013
An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Heinrich's reason for including a single, impossibly difficult question on each general examination he gave. In fact, Noy said the questions were meant to demonstrate to students what they did not know.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 6:32 left in the contest, junior Wesley Saunders fired a crosscourt pass to co-captain Laurent Rivard, who stood waiting, hands up, in the right corner of the court. Rivard caught the ball and put up the three. Nothing but net.
On a fast break just 20 seconds later, Saunders sliced down the court, and, still moving, shot a bullet to Rivard, who stood in the same corner, still waiting. Rivard fired the trey. Swish.
Different plays, same result. Rivard obtained that same finish—a splash of the net and three points added to the scoreboard—six times on the night, as the senior shot at a 67 percent clip from deep en route to a season-high 22 points.
Just as Rivard hit consecutive threes, the Harvard men’s basketball team (17-3, 4-0 Ivy) earned consecutive wins.  The squad notched its second victory in as many nights, taking care of Penn (4-13, 1-2), 80-50, Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
“[Rivard] is a marksman,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “When he gets [his shot] going, it can be dangerous.”
With his sixth and final three-pointer of the night, Rivard moved into fourth all-time for three-pointers made, tying the record of Penn alum Tim Begley ’05 with 253.
“If [the shot] feels good, if I am balanced, if it…is a good shot for our team, [I take it]," Rivard explained. “You hit the first one, it gets you going. [My teammates] did a great job of finding me in transition…. [The shots] just felt great today, as they did last night.”
At one point in the contest, the co-captain drained three shots from beyond the arc within a 56-second span, extending Harvard’s lead from 23 to 32 points. Rivard scored more points in that allotment of time than the Quakers had tallied in the final 11 minutes of the first half.
All of Rivard’s threes came off of assists from his teammates, most of which were delivered from long-range.
“It was outstanding how our guys found him,” Amaker said. “It is one thing to be open, but they put it right on him—on target, on time. In a lot of ways, the heavy lifting was done and he had do the part that for him, at times, can look very easy—which is to catch [the ball] and get it up there. He is that good of a jump shooter.”
A LITTLE HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS
 
Rivard, however, was not the only senior working on his target practice on Saturday night. Classmates Kyle Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry also lit it up from deep, as the pair went a perfect five-of-five from beyond the arc.
The veteran trio of Casey, Curry, and Rivard combined to shoot 75.6 percent from downtown and made more three-pointers in this single game—11—than Penn has in all of conference play thus far—seven.
After the contest, Amaker labeled one of these treys as one of the more pivotal shots of the game.
With under 10 seconds left in the first half, Saunders found an open Curry on the right wing. Curry caught the pass from the top of the key and put up the three, finishing off a 29-5 Harvard run and sending the Crimson to intermission with a 21-point lead.
“[That score] was another momentum play,” Amaker said. “An uplifting three-point shot…. I can honestly say that we knew that shot was a big shot and, if we could seize momentum early in the second half, that it could be a decisive moment there.”
THE NUMBERS GAME
For the first eight minutes and 53 seconds, it looked as if the Harvard-Penn matchup would live up to its billing as one of the tightest—and tensest—games of the season. For the first eight minutes and 53 seconds, the Quakers and the Crimson essentially traded baskets, taking an eye for an eye, with one jump shot answered by the next.
And then Penn turned the other cheek. That was when the Crimson hits started coming.
From the 11:07 mark of the first period until the not-so-bitter end, Harvard outscored its Philadelphia counterpart, 65-32. From that tick of the clock on, the Quakers tallied only 13 field goals. In contrast, from that point forward, the Crimson notched 11 three-pointers.
The various numbers add up to the biggest Harvard win over Penn in the matchup’s history. The next largest defeat came in the midst of World War II, in the 1941-1942 season, when Harvard blew out the Quakers by 27 points.
“We were locked in on the things that we thought we needed to do to take control of the game,” Amaker said. “I give our kids credit for taking control and executing things that they have been taught and drilled to do. We can come at people in spurts and waves….  We took advantage of things to extend [the lead]."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team appeared to be carrying an immense amount of momentum coming into Saturday’s night’s game, but that impetus soon came to a screeching halt.
Less than 24 hours after defeating four-time reigning Ivy League champion Princeton at Jadwin Gymnasium, Harvard (13-5, 3-1 Ivy) fell flat at the hands of Penn (12-5, 2-1 Ivy) on Saturday night, losing to the Quakers at the Palestra, 67-38.
“It was one of the weirdest experiences I’ve ever had [in my 40 years of coaching,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
Entering the second half with a seven-point deficit, the Crimson was within striking distance. But a 20-7 run to begin the second frame extended the Quakers lead to 20 with 12:28 left in the contest.
The 38-point output marks the lowest for the team on the season. Harvard struggled to score from the onset of the contest and could not find any rhythm from the field for the remainder of the game. The Crimson shot 18.3% from the field on the night, also a season low. No player registered more than two field goals.
“I’ve never experienced a team with all of the ability and ways to score … shoot 18 percent from the floor,” Delaney-Smith said. “[It is] inexplicable to me.”
Penn freshman center Sydney Stipanovich was part of the reason why Harvard was unable to regularly score on the night. The rookie blocked nine shots and grabbed nine rebounds in the tilt. Junior forward Kara Bonenberger was also integral to the Penn defense, recording 12 boards and 3 steals in the winning effort.
“[Syndey Stipanovich] is a great player,” freshman guard Grace Keane said. “We knew that she was going to give us a tough time, and she did. Next time, we’ll be more prepared for what she throws at us.”
The Quakers also exploited the advantage they gained on the night at the free-throw line. Penn reached the charity stripe 29 times compared to the Crimson’s 13 attempts and hit 14 more on the night, leaving Harvard with foul trouble and problems on the scoreboard.
The Quakers benefitted from a balanced attack on the night, with five players scoring in double figures, including a team-high 15 points from Stipanovich. Junior guard Renee Busch led the effort from the bench with 11 points.
Penn began to break away from the Crimson with 9:25 remaining in the first half. Down, 9-8, Busch hit three treys in the remainder of the half as part of a 13-2 run to bring its lead to 10 just before the close of the half. Harvard was never able to recover the lead.
“The threes that were hit by Busch is something that she doesn’t ordinarily do,” Delaney-Smith said. “She had a pretty decent defender running at her all three times.”
Senior guard Christine Clark was the only Crimson player to register double figure points, managing to record 10 points on a 2-for-13 shooting performance from the field. The fourth-year guard also notched a team-high nine rebounds in the losing effort.  The bench matched the output of the starters, with both groups putting up 19 points.
‘My criticism of the game was our rebounding effort,” Delaney-Smith said. “When you’re not shooting well, your rebounding effort has to better than ours [was].”
Harvard was unable to solve the Penn defense with the three-ball in order to avoid the inside presence of Stipanovich. Harvard only connected on five of its 28 attempts from beyond the arc, a conversion rate of only 17.9%. The Crimson did not fair too much better from within 20 feet, only going 8-for-43 in the range.
Harvard’s split on this weekend road trip matched its performance last year, but in reverse fashion.  The Crimson dropped its game to Princeton last year and won in the Palestra against Penn.
The loss is the first of the 2014 calendar year and also snaps a four-game winning streak for Harvard. The squad’s last defeat came at Fordham on Dec. 30 in team’s last game in 2013.
With the Crimson’s loss, no undefeated teams remain in the Ivy League. Five teams stand at one-loss in the Ancient Eight in the beginning of the race for the title that is the regular season.
“We’re in the exact same place as we were before the weekend,” coach Delaney-Smith said. “I’m walking away from this weekend knowing we can beat [Penn] at home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first games of the regular season, it did not take long for the Harvard women’s water polo team to mesh together.
Playing in a doubleheader at Villanova on Saturday, the Crimson (2-0) achieved back-to-back victories over Villanova (0-3) and Iona (0-3), 17-9 and 16-15, respectively.
HARVARD 16, IONA 15
Harvard saw its second win of the day come in dramatic fashion, prevailing in a double-overtime battle against the Gaels.
Down by four goals with 4:28 left in the fourth quarter, the Crimson managed to rally back with a scoring rally from junior Kalina Grabb, sophomore Yoshi Andersen, freshman Michelle Martinelli, and co-captain Shayna Price. When the buzzer sounded at the end of regulation, the two teams were tied at 13.
Andersen led the Harvard offense for the game, finishing with five goals on 10 shots and one assist.
“We were mentally tough,” Price said. “We were down…and came back with four goals in four minutes. In the last minutes we stole the ball and put it away and kept our heads in the game to make sure that we played with urgency, but it was a patient urgency and I think that’s what paid off for us.”
The team met the overtime challenge full on as it answered Iona’s goal in the opening minute of the fifth frame with a tally from sophomore Charlotte Hendrix, which pushed the game into an additional extra round of play.
After each team surrendered another goal, Harvard sealed the deal on a 6-5 advantage with 1:06 left in the game.
“It was pretty crazy,” co-captain Ariel Dukes said. “Iona did a great job and played a great game, but things just started going our way. It was a pretty hard fought overtime, but I’m happy with the way our team stayed calm and kept fighting.”
Over the course of the contest, the Crimson outshot Iona, 45-41, with Dukes making seven saves on the night. Harvard went 8-for-12 on power plays, while Iona converted 10 of the 18 times it possessed an advantage.
“We were both physically and mentally tough all the way to the end,” Price said. “It shows we are going to have a great season, but I think it also shows that we have a lot to work on.”
HARVARD 17, VILLANOVA 9
In the front end of the doubleheader, the Crimson encountered early adversity but rode to victory in its first game of the season.
Villanova came out in the first period with four goals to Harvard's three, but the visitors were able to turn the trend on its head, outscoring the Wildcats in each of the following three frames.
The Crimson received a large offensive contribution from the younger players on the team. With seven new freshmen joining the mix this season, the squad looks to formulate a game plan that works to each of their strengths.
“Having more players, especially seeing how good the freshmen are, brings new energy onto the team every time,” Price said. “Offensively, we are able to play a full game with the energy that the freshmen are bringing along with everyone off the bench.”
Price was the most notable asset in Harvard’s offense for the game, finishing with four goals on five shots. Andersen scored three times on her seven attempts; Martinelli, Hendrix, freshman Melissa Balding, and freshman Alexis Del Toro each had two goals.
Although Dukes made eight saves on Villanova’s 28 shots, defense is still a facet of the game the team hopes to improve upon.
“We need to work on our defense because we had a lot of kick-outs,” Price said. “Also, our driving is not so hot. We also missed a bunch of five-meter [shots] during the game that we want to capitalize on next time around.”
Harvard’s power play was effective throughout the game, as the team scored three goals on its man-up opportunities. On the other side of the pool, the Crimson successfully limited Villanova’s power plays, holding its opponents to just two tallies on its 15 chances.
“This weekend, we took it as a real learning experience against two very good teams, so I think it’s a matter of taking the things that we learned and implementing them into practice,” Dukes said. “That will make a good team even better.”

Though the Harvard track and field team garnered many first-place finishes at the Gordon Indoor Track at the Harvard Invitational on Saturday, one of the best performances for the Crimson was the second-place result from junior Erika Veidis in the women’s 800-meter run.
The junior mid-distance runner came in second to Morgan Uceny, an unattached competitor who won the U.S. Olympic trials in the 1500-meter run in 2012. Veidis ran on the shoulder of Uceny for most of the race, going toe-to-toe with one of the top U.S. runners in the event.
To go along with the few unaffiliated athletes in attendance, Boston College, Holy Cross, Quinnipiac, Sacred Heart, and the University of Massachusetts all competed at the invitational event.
Another of the standout performances for the Crimson came from junior sprinter Danielle Barbian, who beat her own school record in the women’s 60-meter dash with a time of 7.52 seconds.  Not to be outdone, fellow junior sprinter Ashley Collingsworth took third and set a personal record in the event with a time of 7.58, moving her into second all-time in the Harvard record books behind her teammate Barbian.
The Crimson took the top five spots in the women’s 60-meter hurdles as sophomore Autumne Franklin secured the victory and qualified for the ECAC’s with an 8.56 mark.
The dominating performance from the Harvard women’s sprinters continued in the 200 as sophomore Christi Scott won the event with a 24.95, good for a personal best. Scott continued her winning ways in the women’s 4x400 as she teamed up with senior Olivia Abbate, sophomore Madison Hansen, and freshman Haley Baker to achieve victory with a time of 3:53.36.
“Everyone [in the sprint group] has been working really hard this year,” Franklin said. “We all just have a great work ethic, and we have a mutual understanding of what it takes to be great. That is what we are working towards and encouraging each other to work towards.”
For the Crimson men, senior sprinter Andrew Ezekoye earned a first-place finish in the 60-meter dash with a time of 6.85, a mark qualifying him for the IC4A meet. Junior hurdler Jarvis Harris also placed first for Harvard, running an 8.12 in the 60-meter hurdles.
“It is always great to be able to win, especially on the home track,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “Both [Andrew and Jarvis] have high aspirations and have their goals set at running even faster and performing at an even higher level.”
In the men’s one mile, the Crimson earned another second-place finish behind a non-collegiate athlete as freshman Brandon Price ran 4:18.04.
The Harvard women also fared well in the field events behind a strong performance from multiple throwers. Senior Adabelle Ekechukwu, a Crimson Arts editor, and junior Taylor Dupont finished one-two in the women’s weight throw. Similarly, freshman Nikki Okwelogu and senior Alysha Johnson placed first and second, respectively, in the shot put.
The women’s high jump also saw two Crimson athletes in the top three, as freshman Raegan Nizdil placed first at a height of 1.7 meters while junior Ann Giebelhaus placed third with 1.65 meters.
The Harvard men’s throwers followed in the footsteps of the women’s team, sweeping the weight throw and going two-three-four in the shot put. Senior Dustin Brode beat out his freshman teammate Josh Whitener by .02 meters with his winning toss of 18.82 meters in the weight throw while junior Ben Glauser completed the Crimson trio. Brode and Glauser had more work to do, however, as they earned second and third, respectively, in the shot put with throws of 17.66 and 17.55 meters.
The men’s jumping events saw one win and two second-place finishes for the Crimson. Freshman Andrew Roney took home the win in the pole vault, clearing 4.57 meters. Fellow freshman Efe Uwaifo’s triple jump of 14.81 was good enough for second, while sophomore Spencer Lemons cleared a height of 1.90 meters in the high jump to also occupy the silver position.
The last home meet until an April 12th clash with Yale, the Harvard Invitational featured strong performances across the board from the Crimson. While a home meet is a rarity in its own right for the Harvard faithful, Saturday’s event also featured a chance to see the All-American Veidis race against one of the top women’s runners in the country in Uceny. The junior’s 2:06.63 in the 800 was less than two seconds off of Uceny’s winning time and six seconds faster than the third-place finisher.
“Running against an athlete of Morgan’s caliber is a great opportunity for Erika,” Saretsky said. “I think it was a real important learning experience for her to be shoulder-to-shoulder with [Morgan]. She has her sights set on doing some special things here at Harvard, and the eyes are opening up to that potential beyond her four years here at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four years ago, the Harvard women’s basketball team walked out of Jadwin Gymnasium with a nine-point victory. That squad split the conference title with Cornell and Dartmouth.
Until Friday night, the Crimson had yet to repeat that feat against Princeton, a team that has won four consecutive Ivy League championships—every one since Harvard’s shared title in 2009. And, near the end of the game, it seemed that the Tigers might be able to preserve their home winning streak against the Crimson en route to a possible fifth straight championship.
What was an 18-point Harvard advantage dwindled to just a one-point edge with six minutes remaining as Princeton forward Kristen Helmstetter threaded the needle to guard Taylor Williams, who finished the layup to complete a 12-0 Tigers run.
“I never thought that we had a big enough cushion that the game was ever in the bag, especially at Princeton,” co-captain Christine Clark said. “You know that they’re going to come back at you as hard as they can.”
But staunch defense and timely foul shooting kept Princeton from regaining the advantage, and the Crimson (13-5, 3-1 Ivy) outlasted the Tigers (11-6, 2-1) to win, 78-68, for the first time at Jadwin since 2009. The victory makes a strong case for this year’s squad—ranked second in the preseason behind Princeton—as a title favorite entering the heart of Ivy play.
“[Winning at Princeton] is a great feeling, kind of indescribable I would say,” Clark said. “I’m just proud of the team and everybody. It’s just a moment to remember, especially being a senior. The whole senior class just came in and was so strong and so instrumental.”
For most of the second half, the Crimson was unable to put any distance between itself and the Tigers, which knocked down open threes and penetrated Harvard’s interior to score easy buckets.
“They have weapons inside and out,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They got into the paint more than we were comfortable with. And I think there may have been some complacency, I’m not sure.”
Down by just three with two minutes to go, the Tigers had multiple opportunities to knot the game for the first time since early in the first half. But when Helmstetter and guards Michelle Miller and Blake Dietrick missed open treys on three consecutive possessions, Harvard capitalized on the chance to lengthen its lead.
Clark, who went to the line seven times in the final 96 seconds, sunk two sets of free throws to extend the lead to five, and Dietrick’s attempt from deep went wide on the ensuing possession, sealing the Crimson’s fate. The co-captain, who hadn’t surpassed 20 points since an injury in early December, led the team with a season-high 25 points on Friday night.
“[Clark] busted out,” Delaney-Smith said. “She doesn’t feel like she’s been back at 100 percent, and this was her best game since her injury, definitely.”
After shooting 50 percent from the field in the first period, Harvard could not find its shot in the second half, hitting just 25 percent of its attempts. The Crimson compensated for its cold shooting by tallying 25 points at the line on 30 attempts, while the Tigers hit just 69.2 percent of their 13 tries.
Senior Jasmine Evans was 0-for-5 in the second half and 1-for-8 on the night but chipped in 10 points, mostly from the charity stripe.
“We didn’t shoot really well,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Evans], who is having a great year, was off [in her] shooting, but what I love about this team is that it didn’t bother them that [junior forward] Erin [McDonnell] wasn’t hitting her streak shots and Jazz didn’t hit shots—even Clarkie’s shots were done in a whole variety of ways, which I think is terrific.”
The Crimson paced the Tigers early on, taking the lead six minutes into the game and then never relinquishing it down the stretch. While Princeton struggled early from downtown, Harvard caught fire, sinking five of its 11 treys before halftime.
With seven minutes left in the period, sophomore guard Shilpa Tummala kicked the ball out to classmate AnnMarie Healy, who recorded her only points of the game with a three.
On the following possession, junior forward Temi Fagbenle, who notched her eighth double-double of the season with 13 points and as many boards, found herself in the same position and took the shot, hitting just her second trey of the year. The basket capped a 17-2 run that gave the Crimson its biggest lead of the night at 18.
“We just came out and had the best defense we’ve had thus far,” Clark said. “The first 10 minutes, it was just unbelievable defense and offense. We were just putting it all together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing its first three games of the season, a trip across the river was the medicine the doctor ordered for the Harvard men’s volleyball team (1-3). The Crimson notched its first win, 3-1, over the MIT Engineers (3-1) Saturday night behind 20 blocks.
Senior Kyle Rehkemper led Harvard with six blocks on the night, a season-high for an individual Crimson player. Overall, the 20 blocks were more than the team recorded in any game in each of the previous two seasons.
“It was great getting our first win of the season just before we go into conference [play] this next week,” co-captain Chris Gibbons said. “We’ve played [MIT] every year since I have been there, and they always give us a good match. They are certainly a rival and bring a good group of fans, so it’s always a good match.”
The game did not start well for Harvard, as the eventual victors fell behind early and lost the first set, 17-25. Co-captain Nick Madden said that the team started off sluggishly and was not able to summon the same intensity it had in previous matches. It was the third time in four contests that the Crimson failed to win the first set.
“They brought a lot of fans, and from the very beginning they were playing with a lot of energy,” Madden said. “Coming off of two tough losses, we started off slow.”
The Crimson picked it up in the second set, notching 11 kills against two errors in a 25-13 win. The Engineers, after posting 10 kills and four errors in the first set, regressed in the second by registering five of each category.
After knotting the game up at one set apiece, the Crimson rode the momentum to finish off the match in four frames. Behind 13 kills, Harvard took the third set, 25-17.
In the final frame, the Crimson relied on a bevy of MIT errors—11 for the set and 26 for the match—to secure the contest with a 25-19 victory.
“Most of it was our serving and our passing, but in the second game we came out and started playing on point,” Madden said. “In the third game we were looking crisp. There were ups and downs in the fourth, but we executed our offense and played well.”
Madden said that when facing a smaller team, the Crimson was able to seize the advantage by prolonging rallies. MIT’s error count rose in every consecutive set while the Crimson committed only six of its 10 errors in the final three frames.
“I think that we served with a lot of confidence, and we had aggressive defense and covered our hitters well,” Madden said. “MIT was not as challenging of a team as the other ones we played, so it is a different style of play since they are not as tall.”
Gibbons said that coming into the contest, the team went back to basics in focusing on only the part of the game it could control—defense and serving. According to the co-captain, focusing on using the serve as a weapon instead of a way to begin points was important for the team on Saturday.
“I think that we did a lot better in terms of the serve receiver game and passing,” Gibbons said. “This week we focused on the fundamentals of passing well and playing good defense. That’s where we struggled against those two Chicago teams.”
Madden said that the team played better throughout the match when it loosened up. When it came out tight initially, the senior said, the team tried to do too much—committing nearly half of its errors for the match in the opening set.
“No matter who we play, we need to play loose and relaxed,” Madden said. “Playing loose and with confidence, especially on the serving end, will give us the ability to start well.”
Moving forward, Madden said the team cannot continue to have early lapses to begin games and place it in early holes
“With Princeton and George Mason coming in in two weeks, we can’t be dropping games to teams,” Madden said. “We need to come out strong from the first point. Letting points slip by early gives them momentum we can’t afford.”
