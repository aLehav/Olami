After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On September 11, 2011, President Barack Obama stood in New York City and addressed the nation. He spoke of “our belief in America.” He spoke of “a timeless ideal,” “the bonds between all Americans,” and “the determination to move forward as one people.”
September 11 of every year, but especially of this year, must be a day of reflection and mourning. Ten years ago, America encountered an act of violence greater than almost any it had seen before. Many people in the Harvard community were personally affected by the event in many different ways.
However, as we watched the President speak this week, we noted that the tone of his speech turned inwards onto America, onto national unity, and onto shared national values. As an international student from a Muslim country and an American student from a suburb of New York, we believe that discussions and events commemorating 9/11, whether they take place in New York or at Harvard, must place the attacks within a global context.
After all, the effects of the attacks have stretched far across space and time, taking on global significance. The list of janitors, restaurant employees, businesspeople, and security guards who died in the attacks in New York City, Shanksville, PA, and Washington D.C., available at the National 9/11 Memorial, reveals that many of them were immigrants and people of other nationalities. But President Obama spoke of “one people” and the pledge of Allegiance.
Furthermore, 9/11 is not an isolated historical event—instead, it reflects United States’ role in the world leading up to and following that day.
For instance, the Bush administration used the attacks to inaccurately justify the invasion of Iraq and to urge the speedy invasion of Afghanistan.  Although President Obama spoke of “a desire to move to a future of peace,” he has increased troop levels in Afghanistan while in office, making the war in Afghanistan the longest in US history. He went on to mention the strength of US soldiers overseas, yet failed to note the 2700 coalition soldiers, tens of thousands of local police and soldiers, and over 100,000 civilians who have died in Iraq and the 4800 coalition soldiers, 10,000 Afghani security forces, and 8000 civilians who have died in Afghanistan, as well as thousands of casualties in Pakistan.
As Harvard students are well aware, immigrant communities, Arabs, Middle Easterners, and South Asian Americans faced heightened levels of discrimination in the workplace, in public spaces, at airports, and in schools. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the United States reported that there was almost a fourfold increase in bias crimes against Muslims in the US.  Nevertheless, President Obama asserted that “we have not succumbed to suspicion and mistrust.”
These examples demonstrate that 9/11 was far from geographically or nationally bound. At Harvard several of the events attempted to incorporate a more global perspective in their commemoration of the day. One panel urged teachers to situate 9/11 in the context of America’s role in global politics. Others discussed the changed treatment of Muslims in America while encouraging interfaith commemoration.
However, these events still glaringly omit any critical and reflective discussions of the wars and their costs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tolling the bells of Memorial Church at the times the planes crashed calls attention to the 3,000 deaths that took place on 9/11, but neglects to remember the nearly 250,000 deaths which followed.
Of course, the World Trade Center buildings fell in America, not anywhere else in the world. Many people’s experiences with 9/11 are intricately connected to the location of the attacks. However, by urging all Americans to take emotional ownership over the event, we cast a US-centric and nationalist stance on 9/11 that dehumanizes and delegitimizes the perceived “other”—and allows us to emotionally detach from wars taking place abroad.
We believe that by recognizing the global character of 9/11, Harvard students and all Americans can make room to remember broadly and compassionately. For us, 9/11 is a day to reflect and mourn a decade of deaths resulting from prejudice, hate, misunderstanding, mal-intent, and repeated acts of violence, across the globe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a routine trip to the Coop, I happened upon a book called “Explore Harvard,” a photographic anthology of Harvard sights published by the university in the run-up to 375th anniversary celebrations. By and large, the brief commentaries are vaguely interesting, and the red brick scenes pleasantly familiar and closely reflective of life at Harvard as we know it today. In a send-up of the all-male glory days of Old Harvard, page 114 features an aerial snapshot, circa 1964, of Harvard gentlemen waltzing their dates across the wood-paneled floor of a dance in Annenberg Hall. But here’s where the dissonance cuts in: College students generally don’t dance any more, at Harvard or anywhere else.
In its place, our generation has taken up “grinding”—defined very euphemistically by Wikipedia as “a type of close partner dance where two or more dancers rub their bodies against each other.” When a friend arrives home in a veil of sweat to tell that he “danced with this freshman girl all night long”, it is safe to assume that he means: “I grabbed her waist and repeatedly pushed at her from behind with my crotch, and we may or may not have made eye contact.”
This radical redefinition of what it means to dance, almost comical when examined for what it actually is, calls into question the central role of grinding in contemporary college culture.
To be clear, I have no personal axe to grind with the grinding culture. I am neither a moral conservative, nor a fuddy-duddy, nor a dance prescriptivist. And in the interest of full disclosure, I’ve participated in the trend myself—sometimes enjoyably—but never without serious misgivings.
Many students who grind with ambivalence are made uncomfortable by the culture because it flies squarely in the face of all basic social norms of sexual contact. Brought up in a society that values explicit consent and mutual acknowledgment, most young people would not think to rub their clothed genitalia against strangers were it not for the culture of grinding ubiquitous on college campuses. Take away the music and turn on the lights, and grinding dances quickly turn into sexual assault charges.
The inevitable result for most young men and women is an awkward, mechanical initiation into this newfangled dance-floor culture. Men grapple, often in quiet embarrassment, with the question of how to deal with the anatomical results of intense sexual stimulation. Women are pressed with unspoken, front-to-back propositions by either aggressive veterans or awkward, groping neophytes.
Assuming they have no choice but to follow the example of more experienced practitioners, male and female students of all walks put aside their reservations and learn to grind. It’s a messy process, and the early, arrhythmic results are worth a good laugh. That is, until you realize that from now on, these first-timers will spend the rest of their party careers working to convince themselves that grinding is fun—at the expense of all other forms of dance-floor entertainment.
That is to say, the preponderance of grinding culture makes it aberrant—even inappropriate—to dance any other way in a normal party setting. Most women are conditioned, against the norms of any other continent or age group, to reject overtures that involve holding hands, moving in steps, or standing upright on the dance floor. These “classical” forms of dance are relegated to the occasional ballroom or salsa-themed exhibition and held in contrast with grinding, the unchallenged “business” end of dance.
Moreover, many men in the grinding culture feel uncomfortable initiating front-to-front dancing—instead defaulting to the easier, faceless paradigm of front-to-back grinding. Here is where grinding fundamentally departs from anything ever called dance: It removes any imperative for interpersonal contact beyond the physical. Dance has always been sexual at its core, but grinding takes things a step further by changing dance from a social activity to a mechanism for physical release.
Accordingly, the ultimate social problem of grinding is defined by its simplest mechanical feature: the front-to-back orientation of the dance pair. Unlike any face-to-face dance, grinding simply requires the man to initiate, exacerbating the alcoholic and institutional pressures behind the dance-floor gender disparity. Moreover, her face and personhood hidden (sometimes very deliberately) from the man’s sight, the woman is given no explicit means to consent to advances—and barring any attempts to break away physically, it is assumed that she complies. Anecdotally, men claim to enjoy grinding more often than women: it stands to reason that it’s because they’re the ones actually choosing to do it.
Despite these essential problems, grinding culture is entrenched as the party norm on most American college campuses. To some degree, it probably owes to the fact that grinding, for what it’s worth, is fun. College students want sexual gratification and human contact—natural things that I, as a sympathetic young person, don’t begrudge them one bit. And while grinding as a topic for moral pontification sounds amusing, its distortion of norms of consent and gender equality is downright ridiculous. If this resonates, challenge the culture. Show off your salsa moves at the Spee. Waltz your way across Annenberg.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I went to the Harvard 9/11 Vigil on the tenth anniversary of the attacks expecting a respectful remembrance of the thousands lost on that terrible day. Unfortunately, I found in its place a political agenda using a national tragedy to promote itself.
Almost from the very beginning of the candlelight vigil I could tell it was not going to be what I expected. Pardon my pointing out the obvious, but I thought the anniversary of the murder of thousands of innocents was a time to remember those victims. The organizers of the vigil apparently felt differently, devoting (in my rough estimation) more time to chastising America for Islamophobia and its other 9/11-related sins than to paying respect to the victims. Perhaps I was alone, but I felt increasingly offended as the ceremony went on and the politicization only continued.
Was there a spate of anti-Muslim and anti-Middle Eastern hate crimes following 9/11? Yes, but it was not substantial enough to suggest that anything happened other than that a few crazies found an excuse to act on their bigotry. Also, as one of the speakers admitted, in many cases in which a few prejudiced Americans directed violence towards our Muslim fellow Americans, other members of their communities rose up to reject the violence and the bigotry.
Even just one incidence of anti-Muslim bigotry would have been one too many, but the reality is that America remains an extremely welcoming place for Muslims, even after 9/11. Anti-Muslim prejudice exists, but it has not by any stretch of the imagination infected the nation. America still unrestrictedly allows minarets (unlike Switzerland) and burqas (unlike France).  In 2009, according to data compiled by 14,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide, anti-Semitic hate crimes outnumbered anti-Muslim hate crimes eight to one. Time Magazine reported last year that “[p]olls have shown that most Muslims feel safer and freer in the U.S. than anywhere else in the Western world.”
When speakers were not harping on about the exaggerated anti-Muslim backlash they fired off other complaints about America that were entirely too political for a vigil. The absence of any mention of the soldiers who have died since 2001 was striking. One vaguely denounced Americans for wanting to be understood after 9/11 when they should have been “trying to understand” the people who attacked us. I immediately wished someone could retort that evil cannot be understood, only dealt with. Then I remembered nobody should feel the need to retort at a ceremony to remember victims of a terrorist attack.
To drive home the point that this vigil was primarily about promoting the narrative of rampant Islamophobia after 9/11, the sole religious reading of the night was from the Koran. I would have had no problems with a reading from the Koran in conjunction with readings from other holy texts, but it seemed strange that the Koran reading stood alone. Muslims certainly died on 9/11, but they were not the majority. That, of course, does not diminish the tragedy of their deaths, but why was a Bible reading not included to honor the many more Christian victims, or a Torah reading for the Jews? The answer is that the Koran reading was meant as a political statement. The organizers seemed to hijack a somber anniversary to advance their own personal agendas by sending a message to what they consider a shamefully Islamophobic America that Harvard was reaffirming that Muslims are still a valued part of our nation.
Even if I might take issue with the assumption that America is permeated with Islamophobia, the message is spot on. Muslims are still just as American as any other group and deserve the utmost respect and inclusion.
However, a 9/11 candlelight vigil was not the place for that message. I’m sure the organizers feel they’ve done something very admirable, but it was highly inappropriate to make the vigil more about the unacceptable but limited post-9/11 anti-Muslim prejudice than about the nearly 3000 Americans who died at the hands of evil men ten years ago. If the organizers felt such a strong need to expand the theme beyond remembrance of those lost, they would have done better to speak of America’s resilience in the face of terrorists bent on the destruction of our way of life; of the way the vast majority of Americans, of all nationalities and religions, united in compassion and resolve in response to 9/11. They might, instead of manipulating the occasion to negatively focus on the tiny fraction of bigoted Americans, focused on the freedom and respect for equal rights that are the truly pervasive characteristics in America, and part of the reason we were targeted. That would have been a vigil appropriate for the occasion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, The Crimson reported on one of the most surprising educational success stories in the Ivy League. In “Ec10 Nabs Top Spot in Course Enrollment Numbers,” the paper duly noted that N. Gregory Mankiw’s perennially popular course had drawn 731 students this fall. But the real story was buried in the fifth paragraph: “An increasingly trendy course … [Computer Science 50] drew 651 students this semester, a 32 percent increase in enrollment since last fall.” That’s right—a course in computer science, for which students report doing 11 to 14 weekly hours of homework and which 25 percent of last year’s class labeled “very difficult” in the Q Guide, is Harvard’s fastest growing offering.
What can the University learn from CS50’s explosive success? Quite a lot, in fact. CS50 is not a fluke. The methods that turned the course into an academic juggernaut with top Q ratings and astronomical enrollment figures—in spite of ostensibly abstruse subject matter and an infamously taxing workload—can be applied across the Harvard curriculum. Indeed, the principal pedagogical lessons of the class—making course content relevant, offering a range of student support services to offset difficulty, and employing a singularly devoted preceptor as course head—can help us craft a better future for undergraduate education.
CS50 has made computer science accessible to hundreds of students with no previous training in it, generating newfound popular appeal, particularly among non-concentrators. In Fall 2006, the year before David J. Malan ’99 took the class’ helm, the course had drawn a respectable 132 students, mostly CS concentrators. But Malan more than doubled that number, attracting 282 in 2007 and building steadily to 651 this year. And whereas in 2006, around 38 percent of students took CS50 as an elective, by 2010 that number was 68 percent. Students in CS50 are taking it because they want to, not because they have to.
This achievement—especially impressive given CS50’s onerous problem sets—is largely attributable to Malan’s efforts to relate the course’s material to the daily world inhabited by students of all backgrounds and interests. Classes may open with a digression explaining how the latest iPhone was jail-broken, or how a recent hacking stunt was accomplished. Problems sets teach principles like data storage and retrieval by highlighting the practical relevance of these seemingly humdrum concepts, with students programming their own spell-checkers, crafting their own web sites and even retrieving deleted photos from a camera’s memory like digital forensic investigators. The class culminates in the CS50 Fair, where students’ final projects—from dining menu apps to jazzed-up Q Guides—are showcased to the community, often with the aim of integrating them into campus life.
Several successful General Education courses like Science of Living Systems 11: Molecules of Life have similarly endeavored to demonstrate how their content proves pivotal in real world settings. Other courses with technical subject matter ought to follow suit, and in this way open students’ eyes to previously undiscovered avenues of understanding.
Of course, it’s easier to attract students than educate them. Many popular Gen Ed courses find themselves bedeviled by large student bodies made up of individuals with almost irreconcilable backgrounds—try teaching a course on the theory of relativity simultaneously to physics majors and those with only high school knowledge of the same material.
Here, CS50—which must contend in the same classroom with CS whiz kids and the hitherto technically illiterate—offers an innovation. In lecture, the course teaches to the lowest common denominator, assuming no prior knowledge; but for some problem sets, it offers two versions—standard and advanced “hacker” editions. Thus, students bored with the elementary material at course’s start are still able to challenge themselves—earning extra credit in the process—while greener students are not penalized for their lack of grounding. Science Gen Eds, in particular, should take note.
But how does CS50 manage to attract students despite its heavy workload? Some of the secret here is CS-specific—each problem set is a project that offers a sense of accomplishment one simply cannot get from reading an academic article—but much of it is not. For instance, the course is able to ratchet up its difficulty by concurrently ratcheting up a variety of student support services. For years, the course has provided one-on-one office hours for stumped students on a semi-nightly basis, employing a veritable army of former students to run them, as well as field questions on the course’s online message board.
Such a collective cushion ensures that when perplexed, students always have recourse to approachable assistance. One could see this more personal, “community of learners” method—which takes advantage of course alumni as peer teaching staff—adopted to ease students of varying backgrounds through everything from the life sciences to Kant.
Much of CS50’s success can be attributed to its indefatigable instructor, David Malan, the architect of so many of the innovations above. Whether it’s shredding phonebooks on stage, training and coordinating a horde of student staff, or revamping the curriculum to make it more relevant, Malan makes CS50 work. Yet, in the traditional university structure, Malan’s position is anomalous—a fantastically successful teacher who exists outside the research and tenure framework. In these tougher economic times, where universities seek to maximize educational yield while scaling back expenditures, perhaps it is time to consider drafting similarly skilled pedagogues to run key courses on campus. CS50 benefits tremendously from Malan’s hands-on approach to every aspect of the class, and so could other large departmental courses.
If a business quintupled its customers over four years, expanding to new markets and far outstripping the competition, other aspiring entrepreneurs would take notice. CS50 has done just that in an educational context, registering massive increases in student enrollment and satisfaction, all while maintaining one of the most rigorous workloads on campus. It’s time for the University to tap this remarkable resource and recognize that CS50 has more to teach us than just computer science.

Harvard topped the list of the best colleges in the U.S. for the sixth year in a row, but it will now share the title with Princeton, according to the U.S. News & World Report’s 2012 ranking.
Though Harvard has occupied the top spot since 2007, admissions experts said Harvard’s reputation does not hinge on its position in the list.
“The name alone conjures up images of being the best, and that alone would carry,” said Michael Goran, director and educational consultant at the college counseling firm IvySelect. “If it dropped to number 10, you would assume that there really would be some differences, but I think the name alone still has the connotation of being the best, the top.”
Last year, Harvard announced its lowest undergraduate admission rate in history, admitting 6.2 percent of the 34,950 applicants.
Goran said people always think of Harvard as part of the “collective grouping at the top,” regardless of its position in a given year.
Harvard has consistently received the greatest number of applications in the Ivy League, even in years when its ranking has dropped.
According to admissions experts, the return of early admissions this year—not Harvard’s standing in the rankings—will have the greatest impact on the number of students who apply.
Early admissions will also return at Princeton.
Princeton last shared the top slot with Harvard in 2010 and finished at number two in 2009 and 2011.
However, counselors said finding the right fit should be the focus of college-bound high school seniors, not rankings.
“Different types of students go to different types of schools and you want to go school with people you’re going to be happy with,” said Amy Sack, president of Admissions: Accomplished, an admissions consulting firm.

Harvard professors recently determined how vertebrate intestines grow into their characteristically coiled shape, through a combination of biological methods and mathematical modeling.
Researchers began by considering the intestine of the chicken.
For the last 15 years, Cliff Tabin, head of the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, has been investigating the underlying biological causes for the orientation, or chirality, of intestinal looping.
But, while trying to understand how a chicken’s intestine grows, Tabin, a biologist, turned to friend and Harvard mathematician Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan for help.
Mahadevan realized that physics could be used to explain the looping: each loop does not have to be formed separately, but rather, if the conditions are right, all the loops will form naturally as a consequence of basic physics laws.
It came down to a simple matter of stress and strain on parts of the chicken’s intestine, producing its coiled shape.
Mahadevan’s mathematical model proved accurate when tested. Not only could it predict the thickness and shape of chicken intestines, but with the proper experimentally-determined inputs, it could also predict the precise coiling of quail, zebra finch, and mouse intestines as well.
Mahadevan is a professor of mathematics and of organismic and evolutionary biology.
Normally, Tabin employs more biological methods to understand how organs and body parts form. That process is called morphogenesis.
For example, when studying the chicken intestine, his lab considered tell-tale biochemical signs, including the different functions of the cells in the animal’s intestine.
Using this approach, his lab determined which direction the chicken’s intestine normally curls.
“At that point, it was clear that the next stage would be to look at how the individual loops form,” said Tabin.
But that’s when Tabin’s biological methods hit a roadblock.
“We really thought it would be more of the same, but we looked and it wasn’t,” said Tabin.
Tabin said his study of the intestine is part of a larger project to understand left-right asymmetry in vertebrates. In humans, this asymmetry most prominently manifests itself in the positioning of the heart, which rests on the left side of the human body.
While Tabin acknowledged that the research will probably not have any direct effect on society for many decades, he said that there are a number of severe medical conditions associated with malformed organs and that regenerative medicine may someday expand on his and Mahadevan’s work to successfully regrow them.
“Certainly, understanding morphogeneis will be essential for regenerative medicine in the long run,” said Tabin.

Former Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine was elected chairman of the board of the New York Public Library on Wednesday, effective immediately.
Rudenstine has served as a trustee of the library since 2001, the same year that his decade-long tenure as Harvard president came to a close.
“The New York Public Library is one of New York’s great institutions and one of the world’s greatest libraries,” Rudenstine said in a statement.
Rudenstine is also the chairman of the board of ARTstor, a nonprofit digital arts library.
Rudenstine’s experience running a major research University may prove useful in his new position as chairman.
The Library is currently in the midst of a $1.2 billion capital campaign. The goals of the campaign include the expansion of its historic Stephen A. Schwarzman building that would make it the largest research and circulating library in the world.
Rudenstine spearheaded Harvard’s first University-wide capital campaign in 1994. The campaign exceeded its goal of $2.1 billion, eventually reaching $2.6 billion—the largest capital campaign in history at the time.
During his time at Harvard, Rudenstine also expanded federally funded research at the University. When Rudenstine became president in 1991, the University received $200 million in federal funds. By 2000, that number had grown to $320 million.
In 1999, Rudenstine presided over the creation of the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study—an interdisciplinary research institution that focuses specifically on the study of women, gender, and society.
Rudenstine is inheriting the library after a period of significant growth and expansion under its previous chairman, Catherine C. Marron, who has served since 2004.
Under Marron, five new libraries were built and the endowment increased from $475 million to $800 million. Marron also led library’s digital expansion.
“Catie Marron—as Chair of the Board—has been a superb leader during a challenging era. I feel privileged to follow her, and am inspired by her many accomplishments,” Rudenstine said.

After five missions and more than 50 flights, the HIPPO Project is finally back on the ground.
The atmospheric testing project wrapped up its final mission last week, and has already helped to paint a more complete picture of how greenhouse gases are distributed in the atmosphere.
HIPPO, which stands for HIAPER (High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research) Pole-to-Pole Observations, “was intended to obtain a high resolution cross-section of the atmosphere” according to the Lead Principal Investigator, Harvard Professor Steven C. Wofsy.
Data regarding the distribution of greenhouse gases through the atmosphere has previously been collected from the ground and from satellites, Wofsy said. But this experiment was performed from a plane that continuously seesawed up and down from 500 feet to 30,000 feet, which provided an accurate picture of the stratigraphic layers of the atmosphere.
“You visit the surface of the planet every 25 minutes, and then you go into the stratosphere again,” Wofsy explained.
The first experiments of this type occurred in the late 1970s, according to Wofsy. However, that project was limited by the aviation technology of the time, namely a turboprop aircraft that did not have adequate range to carry scientists and measuring instruments up and down throughout the stratosphere.
Because of this, Wofsy had long been wanting to try the experiment again. When a suitable grant popped up in 2006, he jumped at the opportunity—this time planning to use a specially-equipped long-range Gulfstream V aircraft of the type usually reserved for moguls and CEOs.
After obtaining the grant and the use of the plane from the National Science Foundation, Wofsy planned five different three-week-long missions at different times of the year, each consisting of more than 10 eight-hour flights. Each mission hopscotched from the North Pole to the South Pole, and then back again.
Wofsy, along with his team and specialists in black carbon particles from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has already found surprising results, and there are more to come as the information is processed.
In addition to creating the clearest cross-section of greenhouse gases at high altitudes, the project provided a tremendous amount of new information about black carbon particles—human-caused emissions resulting primarily from fires and diesel fuel—that are difficult to measure at the surface. It had previously been thought that these particles were distributed roughly evenly throughout the atmosphere, but they were instead found in dense clumps, Wofsy said.
In addition, Wofsy and his team found quantities of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, high in the atmosphere, where it had not before been observed.
Wofsy emphasized that there is still more work to be done, and many of the findings remain unpublished. However, the study may prove important in the continual effort to understand the processes of global warming and greenhouse gas emission.

Harvard scientists have unraveled the inner architecture of bacterial genomes in a breakthrough discovery that may shed light on how chromosomes organize within a cell.
The findings came after researchers applied a new visualization technique that generated the first fluorescence super-resolution images of chromosomes within a single bacterial cell.
The work demonstrates “the massive potential provided by the combination of emerging super-resolution microscopy and clever biochemistry,” wrote Stefan W. Hell, director at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, in an emailed statement. He added that the findings “open a new chapter in the study of bacteria molecular organization.”
The findings provide the first detailed picture of a class of DNA-interacting proteins called nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). This close-up look helped scientists determine their role in organizing chromosomes in bacteria, according to Xiaoliang Sunney Xie, a Harvard professor of chemistry and chemical biology and senior author of the study.
“This has given us a new view to the microscopic world of bacteria,” he said.
The research team—led by affiliates from the departments of chemistry, biology, and physics—used super-resolution images in combination with biochemical tests to study the bacterial genome. They found that HNS, a specific type of NAP, caused clusters to form within chromosomes, suggesting its role as a regulator of chromosome organization in bacteria.
“Before their work, the idea was that the chromosome didn’t have any particular organization,” said biology professor Richard M. Losick.
According to the researchers, the most significant challenge was finding an optimal method to visualize the sub-cellular genome within a single bacterium.
The inner contents enclosed by a single bacterium are difficult to image because bacterial cells, typically 100 times smaller than human cells, cannot be clearly seen using a common light microscope. Alternative approaches like electron microscopy, while able to clearly visualize sub-cellular matter, do not allow for the imaging of live cells.
“Our understanding of the cell biology of bacteria is ironically lagging behind that of mammalian cells due to the lack of imaging tools,” said Xiaowei Zhuang, a joint professor of chemistry and physics and senior author of the study.
To overcome this challenge, the researchers used an imaging technique called Stochastic Reconstruction Optical Microscopy (STORM), developed by the Zhuang laboratory.
The technology previously shed light on the inner workings of sub-cellular matter ranging from mitochondria to brain synapses.
“We hope to even further improve [STORM] resolution to better elucidate these interesting molecular processes,” Zhuang said.
The study was published in a recent issue of the journal “Science.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Richard Y. Ebright ’14 knew he wanted to conduct scientific research as soon as he arrived at Harvard.
Now, he is searching for molecules that could stop the spread of some cancers in human cells.
In the spring of his freshman year, Ebright reached out to Chemistry Professor Stuart L. Schreiber’s cancer research lab at the Broad Institute. Over the summer, he joined the lab full time in the Cancer Target Discovery and Development team. He was the only undergraduate student in a group of about a dozen full-time researchers.
But Ebright stacked up well against the complicated processes and extensive terminology used in the lab, according to Jaime Cheah, a research scientist at the Broad Institute and Ebright’s primary mentor.
“He came in as a first year undergraduate, but I found that I could show him a technique once or twice and he’d implement it professionally with no loss of quality,” she said.
Ebright was soon analyzing cell lines in an effort to understand the specific genetic relationships that can cause a cancer.
Ebright’s work involved identifying cancer lines that are either hypersensitive or resistant to certain small molecules.
The team screened about 250 cancer lines with known mutations across 300 specific small molecules whose interactions within the cells are well-known.
Using this technique, the researchers performed follow-up studies on a specific cancer-causing mutation within cells, which corresponds to the presence of the protein beta-catenin. Though usually in the “off state,” activated beta-catenin causes cell growth and proliferation resulting in cancer. The team’s goal was to determine the pathways through which the protein functioned.
“Based on the hypotheses that we confirm, new small molecules targeting these pathways can be identified or synthesized,” Ebright said. “This can lead to novel therapeutics and treatments for patients with cancers that rely on beta-catenin in order to function.”
At the beginning of this school year, Ebright returned to the lab to follow up on his summer research project. Currently, he is helping to design and implement additional experiments to identify molecules that target and prevent pathways necessary for cancer to occur.
The members of Ebright’s team said they are happy to have him back.
“He’s got a great personality and a good sense of humor. He’s a smart student with an incredibly bright future ahead of him,” Cheah said.
Ebright said he will continue his work in the lab throughout the school year and hopes his work will better the lives of millions affected by cancer.
“It’s like putting together a puzzle,” Ebright said. “But you have to figure out which pieces belong to the puzzle you’re working on before you can try to figure out how they all fit together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 30 Harvard students and faculty members within the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department traveled to Hawaii’s Big Island on a weeklong field trip this summer, giving them the opportunity to hike and explore one of the United States’ most active volcanic regions.
Led by Assistant Professor of EPS Francis A. Macdonald and Professor of Geophysics Richard J. O’Connell, the trip was intended to expose students to the wide range of geological phenomena that characterize the Island of Hawaii. From visiting an active volcano to relaxing and snorkeling off one of the island’s most beautiful beaches, students were able to directly observe the millennia-old processes that led to the Earth’s formation.
“We try to show those early concentrators that you can get in a place that you love and yet still try to understand it,” Macdonald said. He added that it is this attitude toward hands on learning that separates the department from many of Harvard’s other concentrations.
The island’s geological processes make it an ideal location for observational study of the earth’s ongoing physical transformations, said Dylan Trotzuk ’12.
“We would go from the top of the volcanoes which used to be covered in glaciers ... then you could go down through shrubbery all the way to deserts and rainforests and beaches all within a two or three hour drive,” Trotzuk said.
Some of the most beautiful spots on the Island, including the famous black and green sand beaches, are the product of the island’s high level of volcanic activity.
For Felix Waechter ’12, an EPS concentrator, the Hawaii trip marks his second field trip with the department.
“We really do awesome trips quite frequently,” said Waechter, who hopes to go on his third trip next semester while doing thesis research in Death Valley, Calif.
Beyond observing the natural features of the island, students were also able to visit the Mauna Loa Observatory, which collects some of the world’s best atmospheric data for monitoring the effect of greenhouse gases, Waechter said.
All of these activities were part of the trip’s central purpose, which was exposing students to a more direct and experimental method of observing the Earth.
“I think of the earth as this series of old experiments. As a geologist you’re trying to interpret the results of the [earth’s] changes that is the nature of field geology and on this trip they [students] were getting into that experimental method,” Macdonald said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The African Ebola filovirus is a master hijacker. Co-opting a host cell’s cargo-transport system, an Ebola virus passes undetected through a cell’s outer membrane and overtakes the host’s molecular machinery for its own proliferation.
The virus’ main targets are endothelial cells—which line the interior of blood vessels—as well as white and red blood cells. On a large scale, Ebola’s molecular “hijacking” manifests itself frighteningly in the human host, causing multiple organ failure and rapid hemorrhagic fever. Currently, no antiviral treatment is available for Ebola’s victims.
But two studies published in the Aug. 24 online issue of “Nature” have found unique features of Ebola’s viral entry that may at last lead to anti-filovirus treatment strategies.
The first study was led by Sean P. Whelan, associate professor of microbiology and immunobiology at Harvard Medical School, along with three colleagues from institutions across the world.
Using a genome-wide screen of mutations in human cells that could interfere with Ebola infection, Whelan and his colleagues identified a single gene, NPC1, that, when mutated, disrupts Ebola infection.
NPC1 is primarily involved in transporting cholesterol into the cell. Whelan’s team found that this cholesterol transporter is a critical protein that the Ebola virus needs in its uptake through the cell membrane and into the cell’s interior. When the NPC1 gene is mutated, the Ebola virus cannot enter the cell.
The team identified NPC1 from cells of patients with a rare genetic disorder called Niemann-Pick, type C1. The cells were resistant to infection by the Ebola virus.
Whelan said the NPC1 is “a truly essential protein in Ebola viral entry.” But he said that much remains to be learned of NPC1’s specific interaction with the Ebola virus.
The second study published last month was led by Harvard Medical School Professor James M. Cunningham.
Cunningham’s team at Brigham and Women’s Hospital took a therapeutic-focused approach to their research. After screening tens of thousands of chemical compounds that could potentially interrupt Ebola viral activity, the team found one small molecule that inhibits the Ebola virus’ entry into cells more than 99 percent of the time. Strikingly, this molecule interacts with the NPC1 protein, possibly interfering with the Ebola virus’ ability to co-opt the NPC1 protein for its own use.
Whelan said that the findings in Cunningham’s study are particularly promising because the small molecule inhibitors are similar in structure to a psychiatric drug that is already FDA-approved and thus may be safe for human use.
“Although many questions remain in how to adapt or re-design the drug, this is an exciting step,” he said.
Combining the findings of these studies, the possibility of an anti-viral drug that could inhibit Ebola’s interaction with NPC1—and the course of the viral infection—could become a reality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday night and Robert T. Bowden ’13 has two problem sets due within 15 hours. In the next five days, Bowden will also oversee six hours worth of Office Hours, assign sections to all 651 students in CS50, and attend lecture for six different courses.
In addition to being a full-time student and dabbling in the fledgling Harvard Poetry Society, Bowden is assistant head Teaching Fellow for CS50 and a TF for the Extension School’s CS61 course.
“It’s kind of overwhelming, the past couple of weeks,” he admits.
Bowden’s balancing act is not an isolated case. More so than some of its peer institutions, Harvard hires undergraduates to help staff a number of courses spanning departments from math and computer science to physics and statistics.
Juggling the roles of peer and instructor can involve a unique set of challenges—from fielding questions in the dining hall and over gchat to explaining concepts one has only recently mastered. But at least 150 students take on part-time teaching roles in addition to their own courses, and many are surprisingly passionate about putting in the extra effort.
“[It is] gratifying to come in on the other side, lead [students] toward a bigger understanding, help them do something that they thought was a little over their head,” says Matthew J. Chartier ’12, head TF for CS50.
“I can honestly say that it was the best experience I’ve ever had here,” says Anna V. Gommerstadt ’13, who was a TF for CS51 last spring.
PRE-REQS AND PERQS
In the Princeton Computer Science Department, 30 undergraduates are paid to help other students with programming questions several nights a week—but none teach sections. In Harvard’s introductory computer science class CS50 alone, 46 college students teach sections.
Undergraduate TFs have been preparing and leading sections, grading assignments, and managing office hours in CS50 for twenty years, according to David J. Malan ’99, the course’s instructor.
At Yale, students can serve as graders in the Math Department. But at Harvard, around 75 undergraduate course assistants in the Math Department are responsible for conducting problem sessions, staffing homework question centers, and grading problem sets.
For many departments at Harvard, undergraduate involvement in the teaching process is a statistical necessity—there are simply not enough graduate students to staff large introductory courses.
But professors are also keen to give the youngest members of its community considerable responsibility in the teaching process.
“We look for high quality both in terms of their ability to know the math, but also to communicate that math,” says Math Preceptor Juliana V. Belding, who manages hiring for the introductory calculus courses. Every applicant for the position of math CA must teach a short lesson as part of their interview.
Students who make it past the application process are rewarded with their own students, the opportunity to improve communication skills and understanding of course material, close relationships with professors, and a decent paycheck. TFs in CS50 make close to $3,000 per semester, according to Chartier, while first-time CAs in the introductory calculus courses earn around $1,800, says Belding, plus around $50 per student they grade. In all departments, those numbers increase with experience.
An additional benefit, students say, is the chance to review concepts related to their concentrations.
“It’s really true—you don’t know if you understand something until you know you can explain it to someone else,” Stefan K. Muller ’12 says. “It really forces me to understand everything and anticipate questions and come up with the answers.”
JUGGLING TWO ROLES
Each week, Muller spends almost two hours preparing for his 90-minute CS61 section. The process involves reviewing course notes, constructing analogies for difficult concepts, and working through (or sometimes creating) practice problems for his students.
Most TFs and CAs—who don’t teach sections—say the time commitment ranges from 10 to 20 hours a week.
For some, like veteran Math 19a CA Adrian Veres ’12, settling into a routine makes the extra responsibility more manageable. But for most, the job is like adding a fifth class.
“You can’t just not come one night,” explains Ye Zhao ’13, a Physics 15a TF and CS50 CA. “Your students actually depend on you.”
Jim W. Danz ’12 was a TF for three semesters and was head TF for CS51 last spring, but chose not to TF this year because of the time commitment. Although he does not regret his experience, he admits that without the job, he might have tried taking five classes, or gotten better grades.
Another challenge facing these undergraduate TFs is navigating the blurred line between peer and instructor.
Bowden has had classes with his students, and as a sophomore TF, found himself teaching material to seniors. But he says both situations actually enhanced his experience—he could connect with students more easily in section because he knew them outside of class, and his seniors loved him.
“I see them also as peers,” says Tony L. Feng ’12, a CA in Math 118 and former CA of Math 55, of his students. “If they want to hand in homework late, it’s hard for me to say no.”
That kind of empathy can be an asset, according to Melissa Franklin, chair of the Physics Department.
“They have their fingers on the pulse of the Harvard undergraduate,” says Belding of her CAs.
And since undergraduates are generally expected to take a course before staffing it, they are very familiar with its character.
“If you CA, it’s because you want to,” says Veres. “For grad students that’s not true. [Some] would rather not teach at all.”
But an undergraduate’s ability to relate to students can also be problematic, says Yannis K. Valtis ’12, who begins his fourth semester as Math 21a’s head CA this fall.
“Some students will take advantage of your willingness to be there for them—get a little bit too comfortable with how many times a day they can ask you a question,” he says.
“As soon as you become a TF, your inbox starts overflowing with questions,” Muller says.
A LEARNING CURVE
The job is not always a perfect fit for students. While the average CUE Guide score for undergraduate TFs in the Physics Department last spring was an impressive 4.43, Kevin A. Rader, who hires CAs in the Statistics Department, has observed that this is not fully reflective of undergraduate TF performance.
“Their average might be a little bit higher, but their variance is much higher,” he says. “Every once in a while they overcommit themselves.”
New CS61 TF Yonatan J. Kogan ’12 says a potential challenge may be explaining material in a broader framework when he has only mastered it in the context of a particular course, a concern that graduate students do not necessarily face.
And while graduate students take a year-long course to learn communication and teaching skills, Rader adds, undergraduates get little more than “on the spot training.”
“It’s kind of a double-edged sword,” says Gommerstadt, who is planning to teach CS51 again in the spring. “I’ve experienced in other classes undergrad TFs who don’t really know what’s going on.”
But undergraduates and faculty alike agree that the experience of TFing is a learning process in itself—and one that gets easier with time.
“I’m definitely not afraid to say ‘I don’t know,’ and Google it after section,” says Thomas M. MacWilliam ’13, a CS50 TF, of responding to tough questions.
A REWARDING INVESTMENT
The most challenging and exciting part of the job, according to Physics 15a TF Andrew R. Milewski ’12, is keeping students motivated.
“I don’t care what you have to do to engage them—stand on your head if you have to,” he says. “The energy you bring to the situation will be reflected back to you by the students.”
According to some of his students, Milewski sometimes brings snacks to section, offers interesting examples, and provides practice problems of varying difficulty, from “confidence-builders” to “face-melters.”
“If you’re not tired after a section, you didn’t bring enough energy,” he says.
Most undergraduates relish the “creative flexibility,” as CS50 head TF Chartier puts it, of teaching.
Others feel a commitment to give back to the academic communities that have defined their experiences at Harvard.
“I didn’t want people to rule out entering this new major at Harvard [Biomedical Engineering] just because of what they’d heard about its fundamental intro course,” says ES53 TF Anugraha M. Raman ’12. “I hoped that by TFng this class I could more directly convince my peers what an exciting and engaging field they were entering into.”
For all the time it took, Danz’s commitment to his role as head TF was one of the “anchoring” factors that convinced him not to accept an offer to leave college to work for a start-up company. Now, he says, he is glad he never left.
Ultimately, most undergraduates who take on the role of peer-instructor love what they are studying and love to share that passion. Their enthusiasm is usually hard for students to miss.
“One of my warmest moments that I’ve had at Harvard was reading the CUE evaluation that students wrote for me,” reminisces Valtis. He shares some of the comments students have written: “‘You taught me math,’ ‘If it wasn’t for you I would have failed the class,’ and ‘You made me like math or calculus.’”
For Valtis and his peers—many of whom are considering careers in academia thanks to their experiences—those comments are only the beginning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Timothy J. Roemer, the U.S. Ambassador to India from 2009 to June of 2011, will be a Fall Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Politics during the week of Oct. 3, the IOP announced Thursday.
According to IOP President Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, Roemer was a natural choice for the fellowship given his prior government experience at home and abroad.
“Students have continually expressed interest in having fellows with international experience join the IOP,” Solnet said. “Roemer is a really interesting fit. He comes from not having a huge international relations background [prior to being named Ambassador], and is someone who has held elective office.”
Roemer, a moderate, pro-life Democrat with a Ph.D. in American government, made the transition from academia to politics more than 20 years ago.
He represented Indiana’s third district in the House of Representatives from 1991 until 2003, when he decided not to run for reelection.
He was also briefly considered as a candidate to chair the Democratic National Committee in 2004, winning the support of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
In Congress, Roemer served on various committees and task forces, including the 9/11 Commission.
“There’s a lot of interest on campus with the growth of India, and having someone who has been there as Ambassador for many years is interesting,” IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 said. “But also as a former member of the 9/11 Commission and of Congress, he brings a lot of interesting perspectives. We’re excited to have him,” Grayson said.
Roemer resigned from his post in India earlier this year, citing his desire to spend more time with his family. After his return, Roemer was considered a potential nominee for Secretary of Commerce.
Roemer has a reputation for consensus building, Solnet said.
“He’s not someone who is extremely ideological. He’s someone who seeks to build consensus, and his record in Congress shows that,” Solnet said. “He brings a sense of consensus building that people think Congress lacks now.”
Following his career in the House of Representatives, Roemer became the president of the Center for National Policy, a national security think tank in Washington, D.C.
Roemer told IOP leaders he is interested in visiting the rare books collection in Houghton Library during his week at Harvard, when he hopes to examine materials on the Kennedy family and 19th-century American literature.
“I’m not sure we’ve had a visitor in recent years who wants to spend time in the rare books collection,” Grayson joked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard and SEIU Local 615 will enter into contract negotiations for custodial workers on Monday at 1 p.m. in the Radcliffe Gym.
SEIU leaders said that one of the primary issues in the coming contract negotiations will be increasing the number of full-time jobs.
“This is a basic right for working people,” SEIU Higher Education Director Wayne M. Langley said. “Full-time jobs are important for a decent quality of life.”
Langley said higher wages for workers will also be an important topic during contract negotiations.
The discussions come while Local 615—which represents custodial workers and security guards—and the University are in arbitration over a contract dispute. Earlier this year, SEIU filed a grievance against the University, saying it violated its contract by not posting job listings properly.
“The University is not following the proper job posting protocol,” Langley said at the time.
The University denied the union’s claim, calling it “[An] issue of interpretation of contract language.”
According to Langley, it could take up to six months to resolve the arbitration.
The University said it is looking forward to a mutually beneficial contract negotiation with Local 615 in the coming months.
“We are proud of the strong relationship that exists between the institution and its unionized workers,” said University spokesman Kevin Galvin. “We are looking forward to a round of contract talks that we hope will be productive for both the University and the people who help to make it one of the world’s premier institutions for research and education.”
These talks come days after the University reached a tentative agreement with UNITE HERE!, which represents Harvard dining hall workers. Both parties praised the terms of that agreement,
saying that it served the interests of both the University and its workers.
Members of the Student Labor Action Movement said that the custodial workers have their support.
SLAM member William P. Whitham ’14 said that custodial workers face inconvenient split shifts and scheduling issues that SLAM hopes will be remedied with the new contract.
“Split shifts [are] a real pain because some people have to commute 45 minutes to get to Harvard and you have to spend a bunch of money,” he said.
Whitham said that Harvard has a duty not only to educate students, but also to treat workers with dignity.
“Harvard has an obligation to treat its workers fairly,” he said. “Not out of any sense of charity, but rather out of a sense of justice.”
He added that he feels the workers’ requests are more than reasonable.
“Harvard is not poor, and we’re not asking for anything really radical,” he said. “Just a fair contract.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking before an audience of about 50 undergraduate and graduate students on Thursday, Gordon S. Jones—the director of the Harvard Innovation Lab—predicted that the forthcoming Allston facility will reduce the University’s shortcomings in fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.
The $20 million project—slated to open Nov. 18—will provide a space where local businesses, non-profits, entrepreneurs, and University affiliates can discuss and realize their business plans through collaboration and instruction provided by the Small Business Administration, Service Corps of Retired Executives, Center for Women & Enterprise, and the Massachusetts Small Business Development Center Network.
The facility is “Harvard’s attempt to say where can we, as a very disconnected or decentralized university, try to actually see some power in the ‘One Harvard’ President Faust talked about,” Jones said. University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly said that she would like to break down boundaries between Harvard’s different schools and departments.
The I-Lab will be equipped with a coffee shop and a 24/7 public meeting space and will host networking events, presentations, and lectures for residents, small business owners, faculty, and students across Harvard’s schools.
According to Jones, the I-Lab project was sparked by members of the Harvard community who “realized that entrepreneurship and innovation is an area that the University has at best been neutral in—perhaps we can even say very unhelpful.”
He added that the I-Lab is also an initiative to redefine Harvard’s role in the larger Boston innovation community.
Right now, Jones said, Harvard’s entrepreneurial community is sometimes viewed as “being very closed, or not really open to playing ball with the neighbors, so to speak.”
The Lab will occupy 125 Western Ave., where the WGBH radio station building used to sit. The location is almost directly across from the now paved-over five-acre plot that was intended for the Allston Science Complex, a project that has been indefinitely halted due to financial constraints.
Although he joked that he “would love nothing more than to blow up a building in Harvard Square and put this building there,” Jones predicted that “thirty years from now this location could be the geographic center of this campus.”
Jones’ talk came at an Office of Career Services-sponsored event designed to give Harvard students an opportunity to learn more about the I-Lab.
Pulak Goyal ’15 echoed Jones’ remarks, saying he believes Harvard needs to do more to facilitate the work of budding entrepreneurs.
“I’ve noticed that the school doesn’t really foster the entrepreneurial spirit like MIT or other schools,” Goyal said.
Vidal U. Ekechukwu ’12, who attended the event and has been working on a start-up of his own, said he welcomed the I-Lab as a much needed workspace on campus.
“One thing that I’ve really wanted consistently is a place to go and work on [my start-up]. That’s one of the biggest challenges you face when you’re starting something up,” Ekechukwu said. “You need somewhere to go where the people have the same spirit as you. This seems to be exactly that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Construction on Tata Hall has gained official approval following a unanimous vote Thursday night by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which oversees city development projects.
Tata Hall is a proposed wing on the Harvard Business School campus that will house classrooms and living accommodations for professionals in the executive education program. The program, according to Michael F. Glavin, who is the deputy director for institutional development, brings thousands of corporate officials from around the world into Boston for short-term education and training programs.
“Tata Hall will enable Harvard Business School to extend and enhance our executive education programs, serving as a magnet for global leaders seeking professional development in today’s evolving business arena,” Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said in a statement.
Glavin echoed Nohria’s statement, saying that he expects the facility to “allow The Harvard Business School to maintain its competitive advantage in the field of education.”
The $100 million project—funded in part by a $50 million donation from Tata Trusts and Companies, a philanthropic wing of the Indian industrial conglomerate Tata Group—is slated to begin construction in December and will include 180 beds, two classrooms, and three social spaces.
The building will be constructed as an arch to create an effect “almost like opening welcoming arms to the city,” according to William Rawn, the owner of the architectural firm William Rawn Associates, which designed the building.
Large window panels will line the bottom half of the building to celebrate the “openness to the city that really reflects the openness of the executive education program,” Rawn said.
The 150,000-square-foot project—slated for completion in December 2013—will be located on the northeast corner of the Business School’s campus to help connect the Harvard and Allston communities, Glavin said.
Glavin added that as response to a letter the Harvard Allston Task Force sent to the BRA earlier this month, local residents will be given employment priority for the 210 constructions jobs that the project is expected to create. Task Force members also suggested that the construction project create more green space and safer pathways near the Charles. As a result, construction will include a pedestrian pathway that connects Tata Hall and the apartments at One Western Avenue.
Mark Handley, chief of staff for City Councilman Mark Ciommo, spoke in favor of the project, saying that the Allston and Brighton communities “welcome this ten million dollar improvement.”
“I’m please that Harvard heard our ongoing calls,” Handley added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 100 members of the Harvard community gathered in the Queen’s Head Pub last night to give their thanks to former Associate Dean Paul J. McLoughlin II, who announced his resignation this summer.
McLoughlin, 36, became the College’s youngest administrator after Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds appointed him as her associate dean and senior advisor in 2008.
The event, attended by students, faculty, and administrators, filled the Pub, which was decorated with pictures of McLoughlin’s time at Harvard. McLoughlin received praise in speeches delivered by Dean of Freshmen Thomas M. Dingman ’67, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, and Hammonds.
“He made many of us aware of student development and brought an extremely creative look to new projects,” Dingman said.
The speakers recalled moments from McLoughlin’s time at the College, where he rose from a freshman proctor to an associate dean.
McLoughlin helped coordinate a number of projects aimed at improving student life during his time at Harvard, including the construction of the Student Organization Center at Hilles in 2006. He also helped coordinate Optional Winter Activities Week last year.
Some of the projects have faced criticism over the years, but administrators celebrated the high points on Thursday evening.
In addition to his administrative role, McLoughlin also served as a mentor to students, especially in the BGLTQ community, Dingman said.
Nelson said prior to McLoughlin’s arrival, the College did not offer as many events for students, pointing to the pep rallies, picnics, and other campus-wide events organized while McLoughlin served as dean.
“He always talked to students and saw the possibilities instead of starting with the limitations,” Nelson said.
He and Hammonds developed a close friendship, and McLoughlin frequently shared fashion tips with her, including planning an outfit for the last Harvard-Yale game.
Deans said that McLoughlin consistently prioritized the needs of students.
“He would always say, ‘The students can do this. The students can do that. The students can do everything,’” Hammonds said.
McLoughlin will be teaching graduate students at Boston College, where he recently completed his Ph.D. dissertation. His position at Harvard was only his second professional job.
“This is an incredible place to grow, to learn, and to be challenged. I’ve been so fortunate to have these experiences,” McLoughlin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 24-year-old Virginia man has been identified as a suspect in last month's theft of more than 1,000 x-rays from Harvard University Health Services.
The Harvard University Police Department identified John L. Mitchell as the suspect on Thursday after two weeks of active investigation.
Mitchell was apprehended in Newburyport on Sept. 8 for a string of x-ray thefts from medical facilities across Massachusetts and New Hampshire, according to the Daily News of Newburyport.
On Aug. 31, Mitchell allegedly posed as an employee for an x-ray removal company that HUHS hires to dispose of and recycle x-ray films, according to a statement on the HUHS website released Friday.
After the suspect posing as the company left Harvard premises, HUHS and the vendor made contact and learned that the individual who had come to remove the x-rays was in fact not an employee of the company, wrote Nanci Martin, Harvard director of communications and marketing in an email to The Crimson.
Officials say the films might have been taken for the silver contained in the film, which can be extracted using a chemical solution and sold at $41.48 an ounce, the Newburyport Daily News reported.
The stolen x-rays from HUHS were from 2004 and 2005 and contained images of bone fractures, according to the HUHS statement. Though patient information, including name, age, and medical record number, was located on the stolen x-ray films, officials do not believe it was the motive for the theft.
In the statement, HUHS said it will notify any potentially affected patients.
Mitchell and accomplice Gabby Miller, 37, were arraigned on Sept. 9 at Newburyport District Court. They are being charged with conspiracy and larceny from a building, and Mitchell additionally for drug possession, the Daily News of Newburyport reported. They are being held on $5,000 and $10,000 cash bail respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Toward the end of spring practices in 2009, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy called then-sophomore Josue Ortiz into his office, as he does with every player on the roster. The two were set to discuss Ortiz’s thoughts on the team and perform standard player evaluations as the Crimson geared up for its summer practices and fall season.
But the defensive tackle wasn’t prepared for what was coming.
“I sat down with him, and he kind of just blindsided me,” said Ortiz, now a fifth-year senior. “I was very highly recruited when I came out here. [From] where I was playing and how I was playing in high school, [Murphy said] they anticipated me being more of a contributor, more developed as an athlete and as a football player by then. He was asking me when I thought I was going to be a good football player.”
To Ortiz, it was the beginning of his transformation, one that has led him to become arguably the best defender in the Ivy League.
To Murphy, it’s just one of many success stories he’s helped create.
The 2011 football season is Murphy’s 25th as a head coach and his 18th leading the Harvard squad.
The coach and his team look poised to make history this season. If Harvard wins at least seven games in 2011—something the team hasn’t failed to do since 2000—Murphy will pass legendary Harvard coach Joe Restic as the winningest coach in program history.
And if Murphy does pass Restic’s 117 wins at the helm of the Crimson, he will have done it five seasons faster than his predecessor.
“The expectations are much higher now. We set the bar high,” Murphy said. “The alumni have those expectations, the administration has those expectations, and it’s all good, because we’re going to do it the right way—we’re going to do it with great kids.”
When Murphy’s team first beat Cornell in 1997, it was Harvard’s first triumph over the Big Red since 1985. Since then, the Crimson is 11-3 head-to-head.
Under Restic, Harvard went 10-13 against Yale; under Murphy, the Crimson is 12-5 in The Game.
Murphy began his career in the Ivy League, working as an assistant in the Brown coaching staff. After bouncing around between Lafayette, Boston University, and Maine in the early-to-mid-80s, he landed his first head coaching job for the Maine Black Bears in 1987. In his rookie season, the team shared the now-defunct Yankee Conference title.
After two years with Maine, Murphy left the school to take the head coaching position at Cincinnati. His teams struggled during the first four years of his tenure—he failed to lead the team to more than four wins, and during the 1990 season, the Bearcats went 1-10.
But after a few years of futility, Cincinnati finally broke through, finishing the 1993 season with an 8-3 record, the team’s best since 1976.
After the successful season, Murphy came to Harvard in 1994, a change he said he made for a number of reasons, including a desire to be closer to home and to tend to his ailing mother. But football played a role as well.
“My first job out of college was at an Ivy League school. I really enjoyed it and was really impressed by the level of commitment,” Murphy said. “[It’s] not something you would have naturally expected in athletics or in the sport of football—I really didn’t know what that environment was like.”
Among the toughest challenges that Ivy League teams face is recruiting, given that schools in the conference do not allow athletic scholarships. As a result, the Crimson has greater geographic diversity than most Division I football programs, and Harvard football has to rely more heavily on alumni support to develop and maintain superior facilities that attract recruits despite the lack of scholarships.
“The first change in recruiting for me [coming from] Cincinnati is that you have to recruit nationally here,” Murphy said. “You’re never going to find just in the Northeast, or the Midwest, or in any one part of the country, enough players that are really great kids who are really great students and really great athletes … You have to recruit every nook and cranny of North America.”
But to his players, it isn’t Murphy’s tremendous success in the Ivy League that sets him apart. Beyond developing players into better athletes, members of the roster describe Murphy’s interest in the squad as one that goes beyond the standard duties of a coach.
“Whenever [Murphy] sees you, he always asks about your family, or how they’re doing, if you have any siblings, mother or father, [and] schoolwork,” said junior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu. “He’s always asking about your personal life, so you know that he isn’t just in it for your ability to play football, but he really cares about you as a human being, as students, as a young person.”
Ortiz, who since his candid discussion with Murphy has transformed himself from a seldom-used defender to a first-team All-Ivy and third-team AP All-American honoree, described Murphy’s relationship with the team more succinctly.
“He considers all of us his 105 sons, and he’s out to do whatever he can to help us out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing quarterback requires a lot more than just a cannon arm and an imposing stature.
It requires the leadership to orchestrate a fourth-quarter comeback on the road in your team’s biggest game of the year. Or the toughness to fight back from an injury and return before anyone expected. Or the perseverance to work to get better after an up-and-down season.
Over the past five years, Harvard senior Collier Winters has done all these things. But he has yet to accomplish the one act that defines the legacy of the quarterback far after his playing days are over—he has yet to lead his team to a championship.
Winters arrived at Harvard in 2007 at a mere 5’11, 175 pounds. That season, he appeared in six games, though he didn’t throw a pass all season; instead, he was instructed to use his athleticism and run. That he did, carrying 15 times for 74 yards over the course of the year. In a breakout game against Dartmouth, Winters—his first name listed as “Collie” in the box score—scored on scrambles of 20 and 4 yards in the second half to give Harvard a lead it would not surrender.
The quarterback came into the 2008 season set to play a larger role in the offense, but a myriad of injuries kept him out the entire year, which he chose to redshirt.
Despite the missed time, Winters continued to work hard on his game. He returned to the Crimson a year later, won the starting job, and shined, not just with his legs, but with his arm as well. Named to the All-Ivy second team, the sophomore led the league in pass efficiency and threw for the ninth-most yards in a season in Harvard history. He capped his breakout year with two touchdown passes in the final seven minutes of The Game, spurring Harvard to a comeback victory in front of 53,000 people at the Yale Bowl.
“Collie” had become “Collier,” the rushing quarterback had turned into a dual threat. All signs were pointing upwards for Winters’ junior season when the injury bug struck once again.
A torn labrum suffered shortly before the Crimson’s season opener was expected to keep the quarterback—named the preseason Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year by The Sports Network—out for the entire season. But Winters wasn’t going to accept another year without football.
“I was told by a doctor that [the injury] would normally take about 10 weeks to heal, so that would’ve kept me out the whole season,” he explained. “But I was confident I could come back sooner. I prayed a lot about it, and just having a positive attitude—not looking at it as something that was going to hold me out, but as something I had to overcome—was helpful. I focused all my energy on coming back.”
With backup Andrew Hatch also dealing with injury problems and inexperienced third-stringer Colton Chapple struggling early in the season, Winters knew his team needed its leader back under center. Five weeks later, that’s just where he was, having surprised everybody with his rapid recovery, but no one with his guts and determination to get back on the field.
“[His return] was a huge uplifting experience,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It gave us a big lift mentally.”
Though Winters was still hampered by his shoulder injury, the junior was impressive in a gutsy week six debut against Princeton, appearing in the second half and completing 8-of-12 passes for 91 yards and two touchdowns. He then led Harvard to back-to-back wins over Dartmouth and Columbia, picking up an Ivy League Player of the Week honor in the process. In the season’s final game, Winters was 13-of-16 with a touchdown and no interceptions, defeating the Bulldogs on the Ancient Eight’s biggest stage once again.
The quarterback’s 4-1 record down the stretch helped lead Harvard to its Ivy League record 10th straight season with seven wins or more. But due in part to Winters’ struggles against Penn, against whom he threw three interceptions in the season’s penultimate contest, Harvard finished without an Ivy League title for the second straight year.
“I thought we had a good season last year, but our goal is always to win the Ivy League title,” Winters said. “We obviously fell short on that end, losing to Penn again, but ultimately that just makes us hungrier coming into this year.”
Winters used that hunger as fuel, working hard over the past summer to make himself the best quarterback he could be. The Claremore, Okla. native went down to the Manning Passing Academy run by Archie, Peyton, and Eli Manning at Nicholls State University in Louisiana, where he served as a camp counselor but showed off his own talents as well.
In front of 1,200 campers, the Crimson quarterback beat out 36 collegiate and professional QBs to win the “Air It Out” competition as the camp’s most accurate passer. Many of the quarterbacks Winters topped—Stanford’s Andrew Luck, Boise State’s Kellen Moore, and Oklahoma’s Landry Jones, among others—are well-known to college football fans as Heisman Trophy candidates. But in July, it was the undersized kid from Harvard winning an award of his own, drilling golf carts on crossing routes and “go” patterns like a predator stalking its prey.
“I really had a lot of fun that weekend, getting to know the Mannings and the other college QBs that were there,” Winters said. “It was a great opportunity to get my name out there and to prove to myself that I could compete at a high level. I think it gives me a little more confidence coming into the season.”
Ninth on Harvard’s all-time passing list, Winters has a shot to move up into the statistically elite group of quarterbacks that have led the Crimson over its 138-year history. But no matter how many yards he throws for, the senior must also win an Ivy League title as a starter to cement himself as an all-time Harvard great. To do so, he’ll have to shine on a weekly basis.
“If you’re going to be a championship caliber team, there’s two distinct variables you need,” Murphy explained. “One is you’ve got to be a championship caliber defense, and two is, a lot of times, you go as your quarterback goes.”
But Winters’ coach and teammates have no doubts about their quarterback’s ability to take them back to the promised land.
“Collier is one heck of a leader,” said junior running back Treavor Scales. “He was born to lead ... He’s great in that he wants everybody to be getting better no matter what time of day it is. Regardless of whether it’s getting sleep at night, looking at the playbook whenever he has some downtime, watching film, he’s always making sure that we’re getting better.”
“I’ve always believed a quarterback has to be one of the toughest guys on the team, and I think Collier is,” Murphy added. “He has the respect of everybody; he’s not afraid to hold his teammates accountable to the same high standard he holds himself. For some leaders, that doesn’t come naturally, but he’s willing to do that … He’s like having a coach on the field.”
Winters is a strong example of the fact that it’s not only size and arm strength that make a great quarterback.
Determination and perseverance mean a little something, too, and Winters has those traits in abundance.
“He has the greatest work ethic that I’ve seen in a quarterback, and I’d be willing to guarantee throughout this entire league,” Scales said. “And he’d rival anybody in this entire country. This man does football all the time. And I love that about him.”
Harvard’s quarterback may not be 6’4 like Jones, a likely No. 1 overall draft pick like Luck, or have won a BCS bowl like Moore.
But in the recipe that makes great quarterbacks, Winters has the ingredient that can’t be defined by statistics—he has heart.
“He’s not [physically imposing], but he fights way above his weight,” Murphy says. “And the kid can play. He can really play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the third game of the 2010 season, Harvard was down to its third-string quarterback. The Crimson’s prospects looked bleak.
But even with question marks surrounding the team’s most important position, Harvard managed to stay relevant, finishing 5-2 in conference play. And much of this success can be attributed to a potent ground attack that earned nearly 2,000 yards and 20 touchdowns.
The man responsible for more than half of those yards and touchdowns was Gino Gordon ’11. The 2010 Ivy League Co-Player of the Year, Gordon averaged 121.5 total yards and one touchdown per game.
“It’s hard to call him underrated because he was Ivy League Player of the Year, but he wasn’t one of those guys that was terribly flashy,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He was a guy that could do it all and just do it all quietly and efficiently.”
But since Gordon graduated, Murphy and the Crimson will have to look to another rusher to spearhead Harvard’s heralded ground attack: junior Treavor Scales.
After two seasons playing behind Gordon, Scales will now take over the role of the Crimson’s feature back—a role he is not shying away from.
“I was thankful for everything that I’ve gotten these past two years, but I’m definitely excited to be ‘that guy’ this year,” said Scales.
Even as the team’s second back, Scales proved to be one of the most efficient rushers in the league during his first two seasons, racking up 520 yards on 87 rushes as a sophomore and 485 yards on 108 rushes as a freshman.
Now, fans will get to see what numbers the 2009 Ivy League Rookie of the Year can post with a full workload. Murphy, for one, has a high degree of confidence.
“We expect, fully expect, Treavor to go out and be one of the best backs in the league—absolutely, positively,” Murphy said. “Our offense isn’t going to change a bit.”
While Scales and Gordon posted similar yards per carry in 2010—Scales averaged 6.0 and Gordon averaged 6.3—the pair covered ground in very different ways.
Gordon relied on his quickness and patience to elude defenders; Scales took advantage of his pure speed.
That speed, Murphy hopes, will bring more big plays to the Harvard offense.
“He’s one of the fastest players in the league,” Murphy said. “We expect that he can be a more explosive player, maybe more of a big-play guy.”
“I like to be able to provide that spark,” Scales said. “If I have a chance to run a safety over in the open field, I’m going to do it, and I won’t be shy about it. You will know about it as soon as that play ends.”
While Murphy knows he can count on Scales to blow past defenders, he is now looking for his junior running back to prove that he is as talented a blocker and receiver as he is a rusher.
Hoping to live up to his coach’s expectations, Scales spent the summer on campus working on his pass protection, strength, and conditioning.
The results have shown.
“He’s in phenomenal shape,” Murphy said. “He’s more confident; he’s more explosive. He can play seven, eight, nine plays in a row without missing a beat.”
When Scales returned to campus for his sophomore season, it had been a different story. After spending the summer at his home in Georgia, Scales didn’t return to Harvard in ideal physical condition.
“I think coming into his sophomore year, he underestimated what you have to do in the summer,” Murphy said. “He was not ready.”
It showed at the beginning of Scales’ sophomore campaign, as he rushed for just 62 combined yards in the Crimson’s first three contests.
“That is one thing that I do look back on and wish I did change,” said Scales of the summer leading up to his second year. “I wanted to make sure that that never happened again. And I knew one way to guarantee that was if I stayed up here [this past summer].”
So Scales stuck around and hit the weight room, teaming up with senior linebackers Blaise Deal and Alex Gedeon, each of whom has well over 20 pounds on Scales.
“It was just like a Napoleon complex for me—I didn’t want to be outshined by them,” Scales said. “Those guys really pushed me in the weight room this summer, and I thank them for that.”
Scales, currently in what he describes as the best shape of his life, now feels he is ready to take on the duties as the Crimson’s feature running back.
“I’m just going to go into every week looking forward to making sure that I’m playing the very best that I’ve ever played in my entire career,” Scales said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The graduation of free safety Collin Zych ’11 leaves a definite hole in the Crimson defensive backfield. But despite the loss of the 2010 team captain, it has become increasingly apparent that the “PBP” may still be among the strongest secondaries in the Ivy League.
“We pride ourselves in the secondary on being a family, known— ‘PBP’—and we are going to do whatever it takes, ‘Play By Play,’ to be successful,” said junior strong safety Jonathan Mason.
In recent seasons, Zych was the undeniable backbone of the secondary—and more than just the Harvard squad noticed his impressive play.
In addition to his many other accolades, last year Zych was placed on the Consensus Draft Services Preseason All-America team and named the Ivy League Preseason Defensive Player of the Year. At the end of the season, Zych earned first-team All-Ivy accolades and a contract from the Dallas Cowboys. He was among the Cowboys’ final cuts.
“Collin Zych is a big void. He was a great quarterback of our defense,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “He was athletic enough to play corner; he was a tremendous tackler. And he was extremely savvy and [had a] high IQ as a defensive player. Do we have another Collin Zych right now? Doesn’t look like it.”
While there may not be an individual capable of replacing Zych, it seems the Harvard secondary as a whole has the capability to compensate.
“Losing a player like Collin Zych is always hard,” Mason said. “I was able to learn a lot about preparation, intensity, and what it takes to win simply by playing next to him. But it is going to be a group effort this year.”
Additionally, though the secondary loses one defensive back, it gains two. Early in the 2010 season, the Crimson lost projected starters D.J. Monroe and Brian Owusu to injury. But Murphy expects that both juniors will return for the 2011 season ready to play.
“Fast, athletic, natural, physical, aggressive. Monroe and Owusu are just natural football players,” he said. “They were very good in high school—very good the minute they got here—and even though they’ve been hurt, they’re really good right now.”
Monroe and Owusu join established players like seniors Dan Minamide and Matt Hanson. The free safety and cornerback, respectively, each boast three seasons of experience, highlighted by stellar performances in 2010. In addition, Minamide, the direct replacement for Zych at free safety, returns to the field with an offseason of rigorous training under his belt.
“I spent the summer here in Cambridge training to improve my speed and strength as well as putting on some extra weight,” Minamide said. “I wanted to be able to physically compete with anyone in the Ivy League.”
Minamide was not alone in his efforts. Intensive off-season training in the secondary by Hanson and impressive efforts in the preseason by sophomore defensive backs Rey Kirton and Jaron Wilson demonstrate the potential for a more physical Harvard secondary than ever before.
While the Crimson defensive backs made significant strides towards success in the off-season, many still lack game-day experience.
“I think the athleticism is there—there’s a relative void in terms of experience,” Murphy said. “But those guys are good enough to be very good players in our league. It’s just—do they play to their potential?”
But the members of the secondary express extreme confidence and solidarity in their younger and less experienced teammates, who will have significant roles for the first time this season.
“We need to be confident to be successful. Rey and Jaron have really proven themselves as tough competitors,” Mason said. “We also have Norman Hayes. He is only a freshman, but he already has made an impact at the corner spot behind the starters. Also, seniors like Hugh Archibald and Devin Saxon are always ready to step in.”
“I think this year we truly have the depth that will outweigh any inexperience,” he added.
Although Zych will certainly be missed, the PBP has embraced the challenge and rebuilt the secondary as a unit—play by play. Between the return of injured players, the offseason effort, and the depth provided by a slew of talented players, the Harvard defensive backs have reason for optimism.
“When you look at our secondary in terms of athleticism, I think it would be impossible to find a better group of guys in the Ivy League,” Minamide said. “We are there mentally as well, with nearly all of us capable of playing the different positions in the secondary.”
“Our level of camaraderie is mind-blowing,” he added. “The ‘PBP’ is both a playing style and a lifestyle, and we live by it daily. We have the guys, and we have the intangibles to be successful already. All we need is an opponent.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When senior Josue Ortiz first donned a Crimson jersey, he seemed destined for a middling career in Harvard football.
“He was just so raw,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Yeah, he was a good-looking kid, although pretty lean. But he looked stiff, and he just didn’t know how to react to blocking schemes. He was very unsophisticated in a football sense.”
Oh, how times have changed.
Fast forward four years and 40 pounds, and the fifth-year defensive tackle is the centerpiece of the Crimson defensive line. A third-team All-American and a first-team All-Ivy Leaguer last season, Ortiz is widely considered one of the best—if not the best—defenders in the Ancient Eight.
And he’s only gotten better since last year.
“I’m lighter, but I didn’t lose much strength,” Ortiz said. “I feel like I’m a more well-rounded athlete this year, and I think that’s going to show when we get into the season.”
But Ortiz’s dominance of the Ivy League is a relatively recent phenomenon.
After red shirting due to an injured wrist his freshman year, Ortiz’s role was limited as a sophomore, appearing only three times during the season. Things just weren’t clicking for the Avon Park, Fla. native, and he was a far cry from the player who eventually would dominate opposing offensive lines. The situation became so bleak that the Economics concentrator contemplated quitting during spring practices in 2009.
“I wasn’t playing very well, and it didn’t look like things were getting very good,” Oritz admitted. “I thought about, at that point, taking a year off or leaving or just not playing.”
After discussing it with his teammates, Ortiz opted to wait until the end of the spring to make a decision.
“It’s very dishonorable to just go to spring ball and then quit midway,” Ortiz said. “I ended up finishing the spring [because I] actually did not have that bad of a spring ... I just stuck with it.”
At the end of the school year, in a meeting with Murphy, the coach effectively labeled Ortiz a disappointment up to that point.
“I feel like that was the turning point right there,” Ortiz said. “That’s what really motivated me.”
He stayed in Cambridge over the summer to work with the team. He gained 15 pounds. And then, all of a sudden, the then-240-pound defensive tackle started to take off. Despite not starting in 2009, he played in all 10 games, was fifth on the team with 35 tackles, and tallied two sacks. For his efforts, he was named to the All-Ivy League second team.
But it was during his senior year­­—his third year of eligibility because of his red shirt—that he truly became an elite player. He put on an additional 20 pounds, and for the second year in a row, made huge strides from year to year.
“[Ortiz] just had this extraordinarily quiet hunger to be the best football player he could be,” Murphy said. “And every year, you just said, ‘Wow, I can’t believe how much Josue has improved.’”
During the 2010 campaign, Ortiz notched sacks in each of his first three games and never looked back, registering 15 tackles for a loss and 7.5 sacks–good for first and second in the league, respectively.
“He has developed amazing quickness and violent change in direction,” Murphy said. “He’ll grab somebody, rip him this way, and push his body the other way. And it’s like ‘shh.’ Two ships flying by in the night.”
Ortiz also has a knack for the big games, especially elevating his play on Harvard football’s biggest stage: The Game. Over the past two seasons, he’s had 18 tackles in the two victories, and in last year’s edition, he had 1.5 sacks. More importantly, he forced a fumble and blocked a key punt en route to a 28-21 victory.
“There’s always a lot of pressure ... but I feel like I feed off of it,” Ortiz said. “The other thing is the rivalry issue. You just get so involved in it that you can’t lose to Yale. You will do whatever it takes.”
A relatively quiet individual, Ortiz also knows when he needs to become vocal on the gridiron.
In a 2010 game against Columbia, after the Crimson defense let up a big pass, Ortiz turned around and urged the defense to step up its play. The line responded, shutting down the Lions. Harvard eventually won the contest, 23-7.
“Off the field, he’s a very smart, articulate, and funny guy,” captain Alex Gedeon said. “But when he’s on the field, he’s definitely one of the most intense players I’ve played with. In the middle of a game, he’ll turn around and be pumping guys up.”
In the Columbia contest, Ortiz also had a monster game, playing a role in two Crimson interceptions while recording two tackles for loss and a sack. Thanks to performances like those, the secret of Josue Ortiz is out in 2011.
“I mean, he’s an All-American, so most teams would try to avoid him at all costs,” said junior defensive tackle Nnamdi Obukwelu. “That sort of changes the defense, knowing that the ball is probably going to be run away from Josue.”
But Ortiz hasn’t let last year’s accolades or the hype surrounding this season change his soft-spoken, humble nature.
“He’s a very, very accomplished individual on the field,” Obukwelu said. “But if you meet him—just talking to him personally—he’s not a very cocky individual. Very humble, very down to earth. Very religious guy.”
And certainly, the accomplishments haven’t dulled Ortiz’s focus and intensity. This year, he hopes to record 10 sacks, lead the league in tackles for loss, and—most importantly—take home an Ivy crown.
So coming into his final season in a Harvard jersey, Ortiz has become anything but a middling Crimson player. Considered by many to be the strongest player in the league—he can bench 450 pounds—he has transformed himself into one of the best Harvard defenders in recent memory.
“He’s one of those once-every-five, once -every-10-year type of guys,” Murphy commented. “He has NFL strength ... and he’s developed tremendous instincts ... He’s special.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most programs, back-to-back second-place finishes might be good enough. Most squads would be thrilled by a two-year stretch in which it won seventy percent of its games.
But not Harvard.
Not a team coming out of a decade during which it posted the second-highest winning percentage in the FCS and the seventh-best in all of Division I. Not a coach who has led every single four-year player he has recruited to an Ivy League championship.
Coming off two-straight seasons of 7-3 records and second-place finishes, the Crimson is determined to retake its place atop the Ancient Eight.
The journey towards reclaiming the Ivy title begins tomorrow, when the team travels to face intrastate rival Holy Cross, whom Harvard throttled, 34-6, in last year’s season opener.
Conference play starts on Sept. 23 with a night-game home opener against Brown, a squad that has defeated the Crimson three out of the past four years. With every Ivy team returning its starting quarterback from a year ago, the league is expected to be as deep as ever this season.
“This year, the talent in the Ivy is pretty even, or at least more so than it’s been the last couple years,” senior quarterback Collier Winters said. “So week in and week out, we know we’re going to have a pretty tough opponent.”
After a trip to Lafayette to open October, Harvard travels to Ithaca, N.Y. to face Cornell, coming off a 2-8 season, before returning home to play Bucknell—a squad it has not faced since 1997—a week later.
The Crimson follows up that stretch with a home contest against Princeton, which finished in last place with a 1-9 record last season and lost the league's leading receiver, Trey Peacock, to graduation. After a home date with Dartmouth and reigning co-Ivy League Player of the Year Nick Schwieger, Harvard heads down to New York City to take on Columbia, led by dual-threat quarterback Sean Brackett.
The Crimson’s last two contests are projected to be its toughest. On Nov. 12, Harvard faces Penn in a home game that could decide the Ivy League title. The Quakers have kept the Crimson from a conference championship in the season’s penultimate game for two straight years, and were picked to three-peat in the league’s preseason poll after returning many components of the best statistical offense and defense in the Ancient Eight last season.
Finally, Harvard will travel to New Haven on Nov. 19 for the 128th playing of The Game, which the Crimson has now won four years running. With the league’s leading passer, Patrick Witt, returning for his senior season, the Bulldogs were picked to finish third—one spot below Harvard—in the league’s preseason poll. That means The Game could take on an even greater importance this year than it already does.
“They’re all tough,” said Crimson coach Tim Murphy of Harvard’s opponents. “Yale’s expecting to have their best team in a long, long time ... It won’t get much tougher than if we’re trying to win an Ivy League championship and, oh, by the way, we’re playing in front of 58,000 people at the Yale Bowl against a team that’s beaten us once in the last ten years and hates our guts.”
To get to that point with a chance to win it all will largely depend on the success of Winters. Last season, after being named the preseason Ivy League Player of the Year, the signal-caller had to battle back from a labrum injury that caused him to miss the season’s first five games. Upon returning, Winters was up-and-down, finishing with five touchdowns and five interceptions.
Behind him in the backfield will be junior Treavor Scales, the 2009 Ivy Rookie of the Year. He will take over the starting running back job after the departure of Gino Gordon ’11, who split the Ivy co-Player of the Year honor with Schwieger last season.
“Treavor stayed up here this summer, and he’s really worked hard to come into this preseason camp in really good shape,” Winters said. “I think he’ll be a complete running back for us in a lot of ways, similar to what Gino was for us.”
At wideout, senior Adam Chrissis returns after leading the team with 40 receptions and 481 yards in 2010, as does junior tight end Kyle Juszcyk, who caught 25 passes last year. The team should get a big lift from the return of senior receiver Chris Lorditch, a second-team All-Ivy Leaguer in 2009 who suffered a season-ending knee injury during the second week of the season in 2010.
“Chris Lorditch coming back is a huge thing for our offense,” Murphy said. “We missed Chris a lot last year.”
On defense, senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz returns to anchor the defensive line. After being named to the Associated Press All-America third team after a 7.5-sack season last year, Ortiz is expected to do even bigger things in 2011. He’ll be joined in the trenches by senior Benjamin Graeff, a preseason All-Ivy second team selection who was leading the league in sacks a year ago before losing his season to injury against Princeton.
Senior captain Alex Gedeon, another preseason All-Ivy pick, will anchor the linebacking core after finishing with 49 tackles and even filling in as an emergency punter in 2010. The group will be without the graduated Nick Hasselberg ’11, who tied for the team lead in tackles with also-departed safety Collin Zych ’11 last year. Senior Dan Minamide will have the tall task of filling in for Zych, the All-American who led the squad in interceptions during his senior season. At corner, senior Matthew Hanson and junior Brian Owusu form a solid combo.
“Matt’s really had a terrific offseason,” Murphy said. “He’s more physical than ever. He’s a guy I think can be one of the best defensive players in the league, a real physical shut-down corner.”
With that squad in place, Harvard believes that, this season, it can not only continue its 10-year streak of seven-plus wins—the first team in Ivy history to achieve that feat—but also finally get back over the championship hump.
“Our goal is always to win an Ivy League title,” Winters said. “That’s what we’re setting out to do again this year. Especially since we haven’t won it the last couple years, I think guys are hungrier and more motivated to do everything we can to get the title back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday, I watched the first night game in the history of Michigan Stadium, a matchup between the Wolverines and Notre Dame. Just about 115,000 fans showed up for the game, a record even for a school that hasn’t failed to draw a six-digit crowd since 1975.
Sometime in the second quarter, the broadcasters asked the trivia question of the night: “Which football stadium went the longest between its opening and its first night game.”
Immediately, I’m proud to report, I knew it was Harvard Stadium. The announcers struggled with it, fumbling around with Penn’s Franklin Field as a possibility, but neither could answer correctly (Ben 1, Kirk Herbstreit 0).
But Harvard Stadium is the clear winner, playing its first game under the lights a full 104 years after its 1903 opening. It took Michigan a mere 84 years.
Even with the lights, the Crimson has never really taken full advantage. The first night game in 2007 certainly boosted student interest, and it remains the best-attended or second-best attended contest of the year, depending on the location of The Game. Harvard athletics also hosted a night lacrosse game in 2010 that drew crowds in the tens of thousands.
Given the clear increase in interest—both among students and among Crimson fans outside the University—why the team hasn’t been playing more home night games is unclear.
But it seems like the Athletic Department and the football program are moving in the right direction.
When Dartmouth visits Harvard in late October, it will be the first time that Harvard has hosted two night games in the same season.
The Big Green seems to have caught the nighttime bug itself. After never having played a night game before this year, its game at Harvard Stadium was set to be its first.
But just a few weeks later, the team announced that it would host its first-ever night game against Penn a few weeks before it was set to meet the Crimson.
Across the Ivy League, and especially at Harvard, these changes are promising signs that schools are interested in reinvigorating interest in their football programs.
Though the days of regular Ivy sellouts are long gone, the interest is still there. The Crimson, Yale, and Penn consistently boast among the best attendances in FCS football. But the reality is that student involvement is lower than it has been in the past, and it seems at long last that Harvard recognizes that fact—and is working to change the culture.
The most notable initiative to drive student attendance is the Crimson Cash bonus, which awards attendees at certain games this season with $1 of that ever-elusive laundry money.
All sorts of other giveaways are in the works as well.
I think that more important than anything else, though, is that most of these promotional games are at night.
The men’s soccer game a few weeks ago drew about 3,000 fans, and while there wasn’t the hooliganism that a soccer game attracts when it’s called a “football match,” it was certainly an entertained and raucous crowd.
Even in the two plus years that I’ve been at Harvard, the sports culture at this school has changed drastically.
Basketball is responsible for a lot of that, and certainly winning the Ivy title didn’t hurt.
I really do believe that there is a demand among Harvard students for sporting events. But I also think that this desire is often superseded by either an inability or a lack of motivation to go to a noon-time start.
For the majority of the student body, I would think that the primary force driving attendance to any sporting event isn’t the game itself—it’s the community.
And in that way, sports serves as one of the very few events that can really unite the campus.
We see it every year at Harvard-Yale. To a lesser but still notable extent, we see it at other games, especially in basketball.
And more and more, we are seeing it at other functions as well, like the night games for soccer and football.
There is still clearly room for growth and improvement. But the athletic community is clearly moving in the right direction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football is looking to start its 138th regular season with a win tomorrow against Holy Cross. The two teams will meet at 1 p.m. at the Crusaders’ Fitton Field. The Crimson has a strong record against Holy Cross (1-1, 1-0 Patriot League), taking seven of the last nine games against the Crusaders. Harvard has also dominated opening games throughout its history, with a 112-23-2 record in season-openers—good for a .827 winning percentage. Harvard has won on its opening day in eight of the last 10 years. But the Crimson’s opening matchup this season may prove to be more difficult than these statistics would indicate.
“This game will be flat-out tougher than probably any other game in the past ten years against Holy Cross,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I say that simply because they are a legitimate, well-balanced football team…They are playing better defense right now than any other Holy Cross team I have seen in the last ten years.
“They can run the football,” he continued. “The combination of all of those things is that they do not appear to have any real weaknesses.”
While Harvard has only played one scrimmage against Dartmouth thus far, Holy Cross already has two games under its belt, which could give the Crusaders an advantage.
“There are always first game jitters and improvements you make from game one to game two,” said Holy Cross coach Tom Gilmore. “The biggest change from week one to week two was our ability to run the football.”
The Crusaders will be looking to continue to build positive momentum coming off of a 37-7 win over Colgate last weekend.
“In the second week against Colgate, we were able to do a good job on third and fourth downs of ending drives and getting off the field,” Gilmore said. “[That allowed us to] give the ball back to our offense.”
The rivalry between Holy Cross and Colgate added to the victory’s importance.
After struggling for two seasons after the departure of star quarterback Dominic Randolph, the Crusader win proved that the team is back on the right track.
“To pummel one of your big rivals, Colgate, which is traditionally a power in the Patriot League, is very impressive,” Murphy said. “They have made the transition from the Dominic Randolph era.”
Harvard’s mental and physical preparation will be key to having a successful outing against the Crusaders tomorrow.
“I think the biggest thing we have been doing well is managing to do a good job in preparation, because nobody really wants to play a good football team who is playing their third game,” Murphy said.
But with Holy Cross’ additional game of experience comes additional exposure.
“It is always an unusual situation for both teams, in that it is Harvard’s first official game,” Gilmore said. “We don’t have any access to them this year. We go into the game without a look at their current personnel…That one extra game of experience is probably offset with their ability to evaluate what we are doing this year…as compared to us not having any look at them at all.”
Each team’s quarterback has made important developments to his game in the past year.
“[Holy Cross quarterback Ryan Taggart] has turned out to be a great player,” Murphy said. “He does not turn over the ball, he can run, he can throw, he can make good decisions. He is playing with a lot of confidence and a lot of experience.”
Harvard’s senior quarterback, Collier Winters, has also had significant achievements over the offseason. This summer, Winters beat out 36 other college and professional quarterbacks to win the “Air It Out” skills competition at the Manning Passing Academy, a result which has created excitement on campus for his prospects this season.
The Crusaders’ home-field advantage may also prove to be a considerable factor in deciding tomorrow’s game. While Harvard has won seven of the last nine games against Holy Cross, it has lost its last two contests at Fitton Field. In addition, tomorrow’s matchup will be Holy Cross’ homecoming game, sure to draw a large crowd at the stadium.
“There is a familiarity with your home field and having more fans in your corner,” Gilmore said. “We are glad that we are playing [Harvard] at home this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team (1-2) will attempt to return to winning form as it takes on UMass (1-4) and Vermont (3-1) this weekend.
Since its electrifying 1-0 home victory against Northeastern in front of 2,500 fans, the Crimson has dropped two straight games. Harvard failed to put a shot on target in its 2-0 loss to then-No. 25 St. Johns, and although the Crimson found more offensive rhythm against Rhode Island, the team ultimately failed to capitalize on its wealth of chances, falling 2-1.
“Both losses last weekend were a little bit frustrating, but the team morale is really good and we’re all in very high spirits,” co-captain Tim Linden said. “We saw a lot of things going our way on the field.”
Linden believes the team has made offensive improvements during training this week that will translate to success on the field.
“If we get an early goal, the game will really open up,” Linden said. “We’ll be able to really showcase some of the talent that we have.”
The Crimson’s offense will likely be led by junior forward Brian Rogers, who has scored each of Harvard’s two goals so far this season.
“He’s always looking to improve himself as a player, and he’s always looking to improve his teammates around him,” the senior defender said.  “He’s had two good goals already this season, and I’m sure he’s going to want to keep that going.”
The Minutemen come to Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium tonight having lost all four of their away games this season.  During this span, UMass has been held goalless, with its only win coming at home against New Hampshire in double overtime.
Despite the Minutemen’s poor record on the road, Harvard coach Carl Junot is still expecting a tough test from UMass.
“UMass is a team we know pretty well,” Junot said.  “They are a little rugged and are going to want to get stuck in on tackles and break the rhythm of the game up.”
Junot believes home field advantage will help push pace of the game, helping the Crimson establish a positive tempo.
“I believe we will be the stronger possession team,” Junot said. “We will also be playing on the turf [at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium], so the speed of play will be much quicker. I think that actually benefits us now.”
On Sunday, Harvard will travel to Burlington to challenge the high-flying Catamounts.
Vermont has started off the season with three shutouts in its first four matches, losing just one game to Colgate on a last minute goal. Senior defender Yannick Lewis leads the team with two goals, but the Catamounts have not had problems finding goal scorers. Three different players, including Lewis, have all notched game-winning goals already this season.
“Going to Vermont is always tough,” Linden said.  “They are always a tough team to play against—very competitive, very strong.”
But Linden is confident in his team’s ability.
“We feel we will be the more talented team,” Linden said. “It’s just a matter of taking control of the game early on, and then it comes down to putting the ball in the goal.”
The Crimson will rely on junior co-captain Scott Prozeller to control the pace of the game in the midfield and ignite the offense with his great passing ability.
“[Prozeller] is really the engine of our team, the brain of our team, right in the middle of the field directing a lot of things,” Linden said. “He has not gotten that many opportunities on goal, but when they come for him I’m sure he’ll capitalize.”
This weekend has the potential to be a historic one for senior goalkeeper Austin Harms, as Harms is currently two shutouts away from tying the school record of 19 career shutouts. Linden, a defender, has nothing but high praise for his goalkeeper.
“He’s been back there for four years,” Linden said. “Not only is he a great goalie as far as making saves [and] blocking shots, he’s also very specific with his talk. The big advantage of having a good, experienced goalie is communication and the organization of the defense.”
Despite last weekend’s disappointing losses, Linden says his team is ready to take their game to the next level.
“We had a few hiccups this weekend,” he said, “But I think that’s stuff that we have identified already and corrected, so we should not have any problems going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a half that saw eight goals scored, the Harvard women’s soccer team (3-3) could not find the equalizer against a resilient Hofstra side (4-2), dropping the Friday afternoon game, 5-4.
“It was a really strange game,” freshman midfielder Mai Le said. “In soccer, scores usually don’t go up that high, and when they do, there’s something breaking down for both teams. It was really unusual the way the play switched back and forth so fast.”
After finishing the first half with the 1-0 lead at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, the Crimson defense broke down early in the second period when it allowed the Pride’s Laura Greene to head the ball into the goal off a corner kick.
Eight minutes later, co-captain Melanie Baskind dribbled into the penalty box and from the left passed the ball to junior Alexandra Conigliaro, who kicked the ball close to the right post and into the back of the net.
The home team held the lead for a mere 13 seconds before Greene barged her way past two defenders and sent a strong shot to junior goalkeeper AJ Millet, who failed to hold onto the ball. Greene quickly put away the rebound, scoring her second goal of the game.
Hofstra scored three more times in the span of 15 minutes to make the score 5-2. Rookie Erika Garcia’s strong header with 75:47 played marked Harvard’s third goal, assisted by rookie Le.
It was only near the end of the game that the Crimson got within striking distance. With a little over a minute left to play, freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby dribbled the balls two yards into the box before sending a curving shot from the right past Pride goalie Kylie Shuster. The goal came too late, as the clock quickly wound down to give Hofstra the win—and the Crimson its second loss in a row.
Harvard is back in action on Sunday afternoon at Rhode Island.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a match of near perfection for Harvard (6-2), which took on Holy Cross for the second time in as many weeks Friday night. The Crimson swept the Crusaders (4-8), 3-0, at the Malkin Athletic Center in a match that was the first for Harvard in its home tournament. It will face two more tough opponents on Saturday: Navy (3-9) and Northeastern (8-2).
Last weekend, Harvard blanked Holy Cross, 3-0, and this matchup turned out to be no different.
“We’ve played Holy Cross already, so we knew their tendencies,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “We did an even better job of playing Harvard volleyball and playing in our system.”
The Crimson came out to win from the first serve in the opening set, taking the initial point off of a kill from junior Taylor Docter and never looking back. Harvard went on to win the first set, 25-12, led by a strong team hitting percentage of .542 and 14 kills.
The Crusaders came out ready to compete in the second set, jumping out to an early 2-0 lead. The two teams were neck and neck in the frame, until sophomore Erin Cooney had a terrific kill that put the Crimson up, 21-17. Holy Cross was still not ready to bow out, battling back to even the score at 21, before Harvard went on a final 4-1 run to seal the set, with sophomore Natalie Doyle serving out the game.
The third set was all about the Crimson. Although the teams battled to an 8-8 score, Harvard was ready to put the Crusaders away in three. The Crimson’s offense mounted an attack that proved insurmountable, with freshman Kristin Casey, sophomores Teresa Skelly and Cooney, and Docter combining to land kill after kill, defeating the Crusaders at last, 25-17.
Junior Beth Kinsella bolstered her hitters with 40 assists, helping Casey and Cooney to claim 11 kills each. Docter also came up big with a team-high 13 digs and seven kills.
The win sets Harvard up nicely for the stiff competition that Saturday will bring.
“With a 3-0-sweep under our belt, we have high spirits and great momentum riding into [Saturday’s] matches,” Wu said.
