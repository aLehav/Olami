After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Associate Dean of Students David R. Friedrich will leave Harvard for MIT this summer after over a decade overseeing student life initiatives at the University.
A Divinity School graduate, Friedrich began working at Harvard in 2006 as the manager of the Student Organization Center at Hilles. In 2009, he moved from the Quad to University Hall as the new assistant dean of the College, and was put in charge of supporting and overseeing the College’s student organizations. Friedrich later took charge of the College’s residential life as well.
In his new position as the Senior Director of Housing Operation and Renewal Planning at MIT, Friedrich will be responsible for the school’s residential system, and will oversee a project to renovate and renew it. During an interview Tuesday, Freidrich said he will officially leave Harvard July 11 before starting his new job at MIT a week later on July 19.
Friedrich, who said he has been “finalizing the details” of his transition to MIT over the past few weeks, said he is excited to begin his new job but sad to leave the students and colleagues he has worked with at the College.
“This was an exciting opportunity that when I was offered it, it felt like a right next move for me and my professional growth,” Friedrich said. “It certainly wasn’t an easy decision. I really loved my time at Harvard and it’s with mixed emotions that I’m leaving.”
“I will still continue to care deeply about what happens at Harvard College even if I’m just down the street,” he added.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced Friedrich’s departure in an email sent to undergraduates Tuesday afternoon.
“In addition to being an outstanding professional, David is an exceptional person,” O’Dair wrote. “He has dedicated himself to improving the Harvard student experience for over a decade, [and] his thoughtful stewardship of the College’s residential life program and work with student organizations will be greatly missed.”
O’Dair wrote that over the coming weeks, she will work closely with other Office of Student Life staff—especially Assistant Dean of Student life Alex R. Miller—to ensure a “smooth transition process.” She added that the Office will announce plans for the search for Friedrich’s replacement in fall of 2017.
Friedrich did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.
During his time at Harvard, Friedrich helped roll out the College’s controversial penalties on members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations. Under the social group policy, first announced in May 2016, undergraduates in these groups may be ineligible for certain fellowships and leadership positions across campus.
In March 2017, Friedrich met with leaders of single-gender final clubs, fraternities, and sororities to discuss the possibility of the groups becoming “inclusive” social organizations.
Friedrich is not the only Harvard administrator to make the move down Massachusetts Avenue to MIT. In April 2017, the College announced that Loc Truong, the College’s director of diversity and inclusion programs, will step down from the role May 31 to become MIT’s Assistant Dean of Student Support Services.
Several other Harvard officials have also left the University in the past four months, including former Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides, former Chief Diversity Officer Lisa M. Coleman, and former director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Alicia Oeser.
“I don’t think it’s a pattern,” Friedrich said.  “I know that sometimes opportunities present themselves and people will—you need to weigh a number of factors and make decisions for career opportunities that come up.”
O’Dair concluded her email by asking students to join her in “wishing David all the best in his new role, just down the River.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College appointed three new resident deans Tuesday—one in Winthrop House, one in Eliot House, and one in Dunster House—ending a months-long search that began in February 2017.
Linda D.M. Chavers will serve as resident dean for Winthrop House, Katy Leonard for Eliot House, and Michael S. Uy for Dunster House, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced in an email sent to Harvard administrators Tuesday afternoon.
Resident deans act as the principal link between undergraduates and College administrators. Among other responsibilities, they serve as students’ academic advisers, represent students before disciplinary bodies like the Administrative Board and Honor Council, and fulfill other administrative duties.
“I encourage each of you to reach out to our new [resident deans] to welcome to this great community,” O’Dair wrote in her email.
Chavers, who attended New York University before earning a Ph.D. in African American Studies and Literature at Harvard, will move into Winthrop in July, according to O’Dair. She succeeds Gregg A. Peeples, a Government lecturer who has served as Winthrop’s live-in administrator since 2006.
Leonard, who earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from Birmingham-Southern College, the University of Limerick, and Brown, will also move into her respective House in July. She replaces Michael R. Canfield, a lecturer on organismic and evolutionary biology who has worked in Eliot House for more than a decade.
Uy—who holds degrees from the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Oxford, and Harvard—is slated to move into Dunster House in July as well. He brings College-specific experience to the role, having previously served as interim resident dean in Lowell House.
In an interview Tuesday, Uy said that he was “looking forward to a new chapter in Dunster House.”
Uy succeeds acting resident dean Jennifer J. Hsiao, who stepped in to fill the role after then-Dunster resident dean and Government lecturer Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo left Harvard to take a position in President Donald Trump’s administration in January 2017. Díaz Rosillo, who taught the popular class Government 1359: “The Road to the White House” last fall, had previously worked for Trump’s transition team.
Chavers and Leonard did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday afternoon.
Although resident deans act as half-time faculty members, conducting classes and giving lectures, their duties have grown increasingly administrative in the past few decades. The role was plunged into controversy in 2013 when then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds conducted secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts.
In 2014, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister approved a number of changes to the resident dean position. The administrators were renamed Allston Burr House deans, required to have earned a Ph.D., and were formally relieved of teaching responsibilities during their first semester in the role.
The appointments of Chavers, Leonard, and Uy officially take effect July 1.
