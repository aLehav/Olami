After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly everyone, from college students to corporate executives, has had to suffer through a tedious PowerPoint presentation, and Harvard is no safe haven. Too many teachers simply throw their bullet points onto a series of slides and read them aloud during lecture. Presentations can be riddled with unnecessary indenting, confusing abbreviations, and misplaced italics. Worst of all is when lecturers flip quickly through PowerPoint slides crammed with complex equations or lengthy passages from the reading.
By PowerPoint, I'm not referring specifically to the Microsoft brand but to the general category of slide software that includes Apple Keynote and various open-source solutions. The problem is not even unique to computerized presentations, although projector slides and overhead transparencies don't as easily lend themselves to reams of text.
The evils of bad PowerPoint presentations are already well understood. There have been many articles on PowerPoint topics, such as the military's overuse of the software. The scholarship thus far has concluded not that the format is inherently bad--well-designed PowerPoint presentations are essential for large classes—but rather that many practitioners make the same egregious missteps.
By far the most widespread misuse of PowerPoint is to put bullet points on the lecture slides. Since people can read faster than a presenter can speak, students will read ahead and then zone out once the slide has been read. The bullets also encourage the professor to read simply what is on the slide, rather than prepare a more fleshed-out speech, and leading students to wonder why they couldn't just read the slides to themselves in the comfort of their dorm.
Using PowerPoint simply for bullet points is downright lazy, and may stem from a more general problem of professors not putting enough effort into preparing for class. However, the solution isn’t hard to come by: rather than bullet points, PowerPoint slides should be intended primarily for images and visual concepts, and they should complement, not than replace, a well-rehearsed lecture.
Professors who post their lecture slides online after class have another reason to limit their presentations to visual, rather than verbal, information. If the slides simply consist of the lecturer's notes, many students will opt to skip lecture and cram from the slides before an exam or paper. Not only will the professor drive students away from class by giving boring, redundant lectures, but the lecture slides act as a complete, downloadable study guide that can be a perfect substitute for going to class. By contrast, if the slides are more like a list of provocative images that depend on the lecturer to provide meaning, students will be much more willing to attend class to get the information they need for exams.
Furthermore, a well-designed slide deck still needs a dynamic presenter to make the lecture effective. Far too often, lectures are conducted in darkness to help students see the slides, when ideally the lecturer should be well lit, as it is his or her body language and gestures which should help connect the slides to the speech contentcontent of their words.
Harvard has so many presenters who truly understand the strengths and limitations of PowerPoint that the few who get it wrong look especially bad by comparison. Law professor Lawrence Lessig is known for his ‘crackerjack’ technique, called the "Lessig Method", where he rifles quickly through hundreds of slides, each containing only one idea or phrase to punctuate his prepared speech. Sometimes the right choice is no PowerPoint at all. Many professors in upper-level math and science classes wisely stick to using the blackboard, since they realize that slides should be for visuals, not for complex equations that can be difficult to even read, much less understand.
Bad PowerPoint presentations are more than just tedious; they can directly impact learning. A class made up of poorly designed presentations may prevent a student from engaging with the material and may cause that student to switch majors.
Students should use the power of their enrollment choices and Q feedback to reward effective PowerPoint usage and punish those who abuse it. Professors who are particularly adept at designing presentations should advise others in their department. And anyone who thinks it is a good idea to use yellow text on a red background shouldn't be allowed 200 feet near a classroom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every time she opens her mouth and lets loose her latest litany of seizure-inducing inanities, the media—dutiful stenographers that they are—respond with Pavlovian immediacy. They hail her as a trailblazer and a model for working mothers everywhere, even as they proceed with their objectifying scrutiny of her every questionable fashion decision. She invites the derision of the political opposition and the praise of the political base, while a majority of the country has largely made up its mind about her. She is over-hyped, over-covered, and over-rated. If only I were talking about Sarah Palin.
Ever since her husband ascended to the presidency, the media has prematurely sought to fit the square-shaped Michelle Obama into the circular hole of Camelot. Still bewitched by the moldering majesty of the Kennedy legacy and always on the lookout for an heir to King John’s throne, every time a young Democratic couple enters the White House, the media assume that Camelot has been reborn. But like Hillary Clinton before her, Mrs. Obama is no Jackie O.
Now, it is traditionally indecorous to criticize the presidential spouse, a memo that appears to have gone unread by His Rotundity Rush Limbaugh, who classily critiqued the First Lady’s “Let’s Move” anti-childhood obesity initiative by pointing out that “Our first lady does not project the image of women that you might see on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.”
Perhaps it is a little crass to lament the tendency of fashionistas across the land to behave as if they were coerced at gunpoint into a compact to swoon over Mrs. Obama’s every outfit, no matter how tawdry or undignified (sleeveless may or may not be trendy—hell if I know—but it is not puritanical to value decorum). And perhaps it is a little crass to bemoan such national embarrassments as the scuttled attempt to fund Mrs. Obama’s pet project by cutting food stamp funding or her preposterous assertion that obesity is a matter of national security (if obesity is a national security issue, then quite literally anything can be a national security issue). Perhaps it is a little crass to engage in ad hominem attacks against someone whose only crime was to marry a future president. But was that really Mrs. Obama’s only crime?
Shorn of a real job since her husband’s election but eager to maintain the guise of productivity, Obama has busied herself with her “Let’s Move” initiative. Perhaps it can be forgiven that every First Lady arrives at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with the expectation that she is to jettison any erstwhile frumpiness in order to fulfill her new role as the nation’s flagship fashion icon while fruitlessly championing some innocuous initiative. The fulfillment of this expectation is little more than a public nuisance. But when the First Lady begins to dabble in legislative activism, it contributes to a more nefarious phenomenon—the institutionalization of the Office of the First Lady as a power center in American government.
There is an especially strong tradition of powerful Democratic first ladies beginning with Edith Wilson, who literally ran the country after her husband suffered a stroke, that continues on through Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosalynn Carter—who infamously attended Cabinet meetings—and Mrs. Clinton, whose misadventures as co-president needn’t any elaboration. Part of the problem is the fact that there exists an Office of the First Lady of the United States, formally established under Mrs. Carter. Given her unelected status, it is inexplicable that the president’s wife needs her own press secretary, her own chief of staff, or her own staff at all, let alone an agenda for them to implement.
While the First Lady wields no formally-mandated power, the institutionalization of her office confers upon her a degree of influence that no unelected or unappointed citizen ought to have. A candidate’s spouse does not “run” for First Lady. In fact, we are frequently urged to keep a presidential candidate’s family off limits and collectively tut whenever anyone is so boorish as to violate this unwritten compact. But as daffy as Palin and Limbaugh’s assertions of the nanny-statism behind Mrs. Obama’s exhortations on healthier lifestyle choices are, if the First Lady is to play a formal role in the governing of this country—even a comparatively frivolous one—then it is more than a little disingenuous of her to cower under any kind of apolitical aegis.

Walking by the Harvard Book Store the other day, I noticed that the Tiger Mother from Yale—Amy Chua—was coming to town this week to promote her new book. In case you missed the outbreak of mommy hysteria surrounding her controversial Wall Street Journal article, “Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior,” Chua has been the target of sharp criticism for such unorthodox parenting behaviors such as banning playdates and forcing her daughter to learn a difficult piece on the piano.
I personally found the piece to be more humorous self-examination—as Chua herself said she intended it to be during her visit to the Harvard Bookstore on Tuesday—than declaration of war. Regardless, it clearly struck a nerve with the American public, especially among individuals who took Chua’s writing as a person affront to their parental dogmas. The blogosphere is littered with rebuttals and counter-rebuttals of Chua’s arguments, which have conveniently driven her book sales through the roof. Chua made a direct jab at the deep insecurities many people have about parenting, insecurities that are part and parcel of the cultural assumption that parents can be blamed for anything that goes wrong in the lives of their offspring. Parents’ mortal fear of being hated by their children is what really makes questions of “parenting” such a lighting rod issue.
Interestingly, my own mother—who is a Chinese mother only by ethnicity and found Chua’s article “amusing”—tells me that there is no Chinese equivalent word for our use of “parent” as a verb. She and her four siblings were raised in Hong Kong under an arguably harsh and perhaps neglectful parenting style, but they all emerged from the experience as reasonably self-possessed and successful adults. They take care of my grandfather, and if they bear him any ill feeling for the way he raised them, they do a very good job of hiding it.
By contrast, I can’t begin to recall the number of novels or American popular culture portrayals of difficult relationships between parents and children in which bitter battles rage on when the children are grown and the parents are entering their last years. Compared to this, my mother’s attitude seems like the healthier one indeed. My grandfather is old, and he is by all accounts a much better grandfather than he was a father. Why blame him for the mistakes of the past?
Granted, this cannot always be the case, and some of the deepest psychological wounds are inflicted by parents upon their children. I do not dismiss the idea that harsh parenting can create damaged individuals. However, I do think that most people reach a point where they just have to move on and take responsibility for their own successes and failures.
In a culture so profoundly anxious about raising kids the “right” way, it may be hard to accept the possibility that parenting technique may not, in fact, matter all that much. In a 2005 article in USA Today, “Freakonomics” authors Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt suggested that the factors that truly predict a child’s future success—socioeconomic status and education level of the parents—are decided long before those parents start making decisions about whether or not to allow TV or playdates.
“Good” parents are mothers and fathers who are doing the best they can. And really, that’s the most we as children can demand from them.

It is a perennial complaint: there just isn’t enough social space on campus.
Figures released over the past two weeks indicate that student interest in Greek Life on campus is at an all-time high, which, in our view, suggests that there is a clear need for the sort of social space to which everyone is welcome.  Although sororities and fraternities are not as aloof as the final clubs—which have historically infused social life on campus with a culture of exclusivity and elitism—they nevertheless rely on gender-divisions and thus fail to provide any stimulus for the development of the larger cohesive community Harvard lacks.
True, anti-final club groups intermittently petition the Undergraduate Council to address the social space issue, and it is the subject of far too many dining-hall lamentations about the weekend’s party prospects. Unfortunately, however, the most frequently proposed solution to this perennial problem has been the construction of a student union, a regular feature on other campuses across the country.
Two years ago, for instance, the UC attempted to raise funds to purchase 45 Mount Auburn Street for $4 million.  They created a “Social Space Task Force” and tried to raise the requisite $600,000 necessary for a down payment. The project, however well intentioned, failed, as has every other attempt to create a new social space on campus.  It is now clear that any efforts to build, buy, or borrow a new space will take years to organize and would probably be unsuccessful. Also, should such a student union ever be constructed, it would likely be met with ambivalence, as it would probably not be used for the sorts of events that draw students en masse in the first place.
The time has thus come for the tenor of the discussion to change.
The real answer to the social space question lies not in the search for a new space, but in the revitalization of an old one—the upperclass houses.  These centers of student life have the potential to become the vibrant intellectual and social communities that they used to be, places on campus that were more than overcrowded, anonymous dormitories and dining halls. If the Houses became in reality what they are supposed to be in theory, we believe that social space would no longer be as much of a campus concern as it is today.
Unfortunately, house life—and the College’s support of it—has suffered in recent years, as the 2007 cancellation of the party fund and the recent institution of Beverage Authorization Teams reveals.  Yet, these microcosms of the University are already well established, and, though underutilized, would be the most effective channels through which to improve the social lives of all students.  The remarkable diversity in the house communities is the ideal framework off of which to build any successful social community on campus.  After all, houses are inclusive whereas off-campus options are often exclusive; houses combine the intellectual and social components of the college experience; and houses are communities to which everyone at Harvard—not just a select few—belongs.
Moving forward, house social life would benefit by advertising more often directly to freshmen, who undoubtedly suffer the most from the lack of social space.  They would serve as ideal candidates for an invigorated house social scene, attending Stein Clubs and other events whose potential is high but attendance is low.  In fact, many freshmen are utterly unaware of the existence of such events.  By inviting and including these new students, houses would thus generate the kind of year-round interest and excitement that currently seems reserved just for Housing Day.
On that note, as we near the frenzy of house placement, we should strive to bring the camaraderie, excitement, and fun of the season to the rest of the year.  There is no conceivable reason why houses should only be true social communities for one day a year.
In the search to improve our social lives, we shouldn’t look outside; instead, we should embrace the houses in which we already reside.
If we don’t, those houses may never be the homes they should and must become.

Nearly a year after Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building was vacated for renovations in order to accommodate newly-consolidated Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology laboratories, researchers say they are mostly settled and used to their new spaces.
The SCRB labs—which are scattered between Boston and Cambridge, including in Massachusetts General Hospital, the Longwood campus, and Fairchild—were originally supposed to come together in the Allston Science Complex. When construction on the Science Complex slowed down and then halted in 2009, plans were made to centralize SCRB in Fairchild instead.
Multiple members of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology were moved out of Fairchild into the Northwest Science Building last May to facilitate these changes.
David Jeruzalmi, associate professor of MCB, said that although work slowed down for about two weeks after the move in May, the pace picked up again in early summer.
“Moving is never easy and it was all compressed into a week and then the previous, let’s say a month, was spent planning the whole thing out,” he said.
Jeruzalmi’s lab and three others wanted to stay together, and they were very involved in the process of designing their new lab space in Northwest. The four labs occupied separate rooms in Fairchild but work in the same open space in Northwest.
“The space looks new and bright ... Everyone has a bench and a space but there aren’t any walls,” Jeruzalmi said. “They essentially gave us what we wanted.”
According to Jeruzalmi, the new configuration facilitates collaboration.
“Students can bounce ideas off each other and so forth,” he said.
Jeruzalmi said that although the move did not seem necessary at first, the new facilities suit his lab’s purposes better than expected.
“What we have is much better than what we had before,” he said. “I don’t think about Fairchild at all anymore.”
Members of SCRB, however, eagerly look forward to moving out of their temporary accommodations and into Fairchild. Director of Translational Medicine at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute Lee Rubin’s lab and office were located in Fairchild before the shift. He is now working in the Bauer Laboratory until he can return.
Rubin said he is excited about the prospect of newer, nicer labs but more than the space, he misses the interactions with other researchers.
“When Doug [Melton] and Kevin [Eggan] and I were in the same building, we’d run up and down 100 times [to confer],” Rubin said. He added that the consolidation of laboratories is a critical process for making SCRB feel like a department.
“The core of a department really is defined by the way people interact. Not just the faculty members, but the students and the post-docs—all those wonderful scientists together in one place,” he said.

The debate surrounding the effects of caffeinated alcoholic beverages on the human body still continues, although it has been three months since the Food and Drug Administration ordered the drinks—including the well-known Four Loko—pulled from the shelves.
In a lecture yesterday at the Harvard School of Public Health, Boston University Professor of Community Health Sciences Jonathan Howland questioned caffeine’s supposed ability to counteract the sedating effects of alcohol.
“Ultimately caffeine does not reduce the impairment effect of alcohol,” Howland said.
Howland and his research team have conducted several experiments with participants under the influence of caffeinated and non-caffeinated alcoholic beverages.
The results provided evidence that there were no differences in performance between users of caffeinated and non-caffeinated alcoholic drinks, as reaction time in a driving simulator was similarly impaired for both sets of participants.
The marketing of caffeine as a product that will clear the mind and increase attention span reinforces the belief that caffeine staves off the impairment effects of alcohol, according to Howland.
The lecture also addressed whether caffeinated alcoholic beverages truly cause risky behaviors.
An alternative hypothesis is that impulsive people—who already possess an inherent tendency to engage in risky behaviors—favor the consumption of beverages like Four Loko.
“Although the number of students that end up in the hospital from drinking too much has been increasing, the idea that all of these hospitalizations are caused by caffeinated alcoholic beverages is overreaching,” Howland said.
Ellen V. Connorton, a post-doc at the School of Public Health, said the possibility of reverse causation seems plausible.
She added that the publicity the beverages have received may have increased demand.
“Everybody got notifications from colleges that these drinks were responsible for a number of effects and students responded by saying ‘Wow, I gotta try this stuff!’” she said.
Howland’s team has published a paper on the subject and will continue to investigate the relationship between risky behaviors and the consumption of caffeinated alcoholic beverages.
In addition, Howland addressed the FDA studies on caffeinated alcoholic beverages completed before the quick enactment of a ban about three months ago.
He said that the FDA may have been pressured by bans implemented by certain states.
“[The FDA] moved from surveys to shutting down businesses, so there seemed to be a short trip,” he said. “Public policy on caffeinated alcohol beverages should be informed by rigorous research.”

Former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry advocated moving toward a world without nuclear weapons during a speech at the Institute of Politics yesterday.
According to Perry, who is now a professor at Stanford University, the next challenge for achieving this goal is the ratification of a worldwide nuclear disarmament treaty.
The United States should not accept that nuclear terrorism or war is inevitable, he said.
“Our problems are man-made, and therefore they can be solved by man,” said Perry, who served under President Clinton.
Perry supplemented his lecture with clips from “Nuclear Tipping Point,” a documentary he co-produced with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger ’50 and two others. The clips showed the development of nuclear weaponry throughout history, beginning in President Kennedy’s administration and ending in President Obama’s 2009 nuclear disarmament speech from Prague, which Perry called a “miracle.”
During the question and answer session preceding the lecture, Perry addressed the precarious nature of some countries in possession of nuclear weapons, such as Pakistan—a nation that refuses to sign a nuclear non-proliferation treaty until India does so first.
“Right now, Pakistan is number one on a list of nuclear nightmares,” Perry said.
The speech, entitled “Have We Reached the Nuclear Tipping Point?”, was the second Robert S. McNamara Lecture on War and Peace. Former Georgia Senator Samuel A. Nunn gave the inaugural lecture in 2008 at the Institute of Politics, where he said a nuclear-free world is possible.
The lecture series is named after the defense secretary of Presidents John F. Kennedy ’40 and Lyndon B. Johnson. Perry said McNamara served as an inspiration to him and warned him to avoid similar mistakes as defense secretary.
Graham T. Allison Jr. ’62, the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, moderated the forum.
Perry concluded his speech by stressing the urgency of creating a nuclear-free world.
“I believe that time is not on our side,” Perry said.

Reforming election policies across the U.S. and modifying the way leaders are selected in Congress could help reduce polarization in American politics, according to a report co-written by Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer Elaine C. Kamarck and Brookings Institution Senior Fellow William A. Galston.
The report, released Wednesday and titled “The Still-Vital Center: Moderates, Democrats, and the Renewal of American Politics,” explores possible causes of polarization in American politics as well as measures that could be implemented to improve the situation in the aftermath of last month’s shooting in Tucson, Ariz.
“The shooting in Arizona got the country talking about the hostility in politics,” Kamarck said. “We are looking at some deeper structural causes for incivility in American politics.”
The study was commissioned by the Washington-based think tank Third Way in an attempt to launch dialogue among scholars about concrete ways to address extremism in American politics, said Anne Kim, the organization’s domestic policy director.
“I think this report is going to be a foundational document for a new movement inside American politics to fight against polarization,” Kim said.
According to Galston and Kamarck, one way to reduce extremism in American politics is to open primaries to all voters instead of restraining them to members of particular political parties.
“It would open up the possibility that moderation and compromise might be rewarded rather than punished,” they wrote.
The authors also suggest that modifying district boundaries would make districts less partisan, and that requiring a super-majority  to elect Congressional leaders would favor cross-party collaboration.
Institute of Politics director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, who worked on election programs when he was Kentucky Secretary of State, said he thought the authors came up with realistic propositions.
“Out of three, the open primaries is probably the most likely to happen. You’ve seen states gradually open their primary processes,” he said.
The report also examines moderates—who they say are an influential voting group—as part of a distinct political movement with specific preferences and characteristics.
“They are center-left on social issues, middle of the road on economics, and center-right on foreign policy. They are not ‘liberals in disguise,’ nor are they a ‘mushy middle’ of left-right compromise,” the authors write.
Grayson, a long-time advocate of bipartisanship in American politics, said that he agreed that in today’s polarized climate, the center has an increasingly important role.
“I thought their analysis of the importance of moderates was dead-on,” he said.

Harvard professors and students have expressed a variety of opinions about a controversial measure to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last Saturday.
The bill, known as “Continuing Resolution (H.R. 1),” has now been sent to the still Democratic-majority Senate for a vote.
The measure initially proposed cutting Title X of the Public Health Service Act, the family planning program enacted in 1970 by President Richard M. Nixon.
An amendment proposed by Representative Michael R. Pence, R-Ind., also passed by a vote of 240-185 to end all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the reproductive health clinic which provides abortion services, contraception, and HIV testing. Voting split mostly down party lines with only 10 Democrats voting for the bill and seven Republicans voting against it.
Linda J. Bilmes, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, said she attributed the success of the bill to a new set of members of Congress elected on a platform of deficit reform.
Bilmes, a leading expert in U.S. budgeting, added that programs like Planned Parenthood are often underfunded because Congress tends to budget thinking in the short term, often ignoring programs that will prove valuable over time.
“This kind of decision making which permeates is the problem here in my mind,” Bilmes said. “Planned Parenthood is very susceptible to this kind of thinking because it pays off only in the future.”
Jane J. Mansbridge, a professor at the Kennedy School, wrote in an e-mail that the effects of the act were “devastating” and the idea that cutting Title X will reduce the federal deficit is “absurd.” She added that in Boston, eliminating Title X will have a negative effect on not only Planned Parenthood, but also other organizations that serve poor communities.
“To cut this form of health-care spending for poor people at a time when so many people have lost jobs and so many families are without any breadwinner is almost inconceivably cruel,” Mansbridge wrote in an e-mail.
But not everyone agreed with Mansbridge’s analysis.
Christopher L. Oppermann ’13, a member of True Love Revolution—the student advocacy group that promotes premarital abstinence—and an editor of The Salient, said cutting funding for Planned Parenthood was good because the program has a history of circumventing laws and the national government should not fund family planning organizations.
“I think it’s something the states could do if they wanted to,” Oppermann said. “I don’t think the federal government has the legal authority. It’s a good rule of thumb that money is managed and spent better at a local level.”

Dining hall workers and Harvard students gathered in Cambridge’s First Parish Church yesterday for a member meeting of the workers’ union before spilling into the streets of Harvard Square and coming to a shouting protest in front of the Holyoke Center.
The meeting, organized by the Boston area hospitality union Unite Here Local 26, focused on procuring “justice and respect” for dining hall workers in the coming contract negotiations with the University.
Speakers at the event called for stronger contractual wording against favoritism and harassment, more comprehensive health care coverage, and higher wages.
A survey of union workers revealed these aspects to be the things union members were most unhappy about at work. Chants of “Respect! Justice!” were interspersed throughout.
Leaders of the union feel that their demands are more than reasonable.
“We want the University to treat us like we are human beings,” said Vice President and chief negotiator for Local 26 Brian Lang. “D-hall workers are mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, leaders in their communities.”
Speakers at the event spoke passionately about their negotiation goals.
One speaker, who has worked in Harvard dining halls for 32 years, expressed the frustration of facing favoritism in the workplace, spurring a wave of assenting murmurs from the crowd.
“You ask yourself, ‘Why am I being overlooked?’” he said to the audience, later adding that “the clause that prevents favoritism  [in our contracts] is unclear.”
Another speaker addressed wages, which several said have decreased during the last year.
And speakers were critical of Harvard’s approach to negotiating health care policy with the dining hall workers.
“All they care about is their wealth—they do not care about our health,” one speaker shouted into the microphone.
Unite Here would not confirm the names of speakers to protect their relationships with the University.
Students also played an important role in the event.
Student Labor Action Movement organizer Remeike J.B. Forbes ’11 told the crowded pews of workers, “We are behind you 100 percent.”
Students attending the event said they felt the need to support fellow members of their community.
“Anything that affects them affects us and affects the whole Harvard community,” said Samuel J. Bakkila ‘11-’12.
Jia Hui Lee ’12, another student in attendance, added that “Harvard workers are just as much a part of Harvard as students are.”
While the event began with members seated in the church, it turned into an organized rally in Harvard Square, as workers filed out in orderly lines, holding candles and signs and chanting as they marched in front of the Holyoke Center.
A part of the team that organized the event, Richard M. Maopolski ’13 that he felt the event was a success.
“It was beautiful,” he said.  “This is the first step of many.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among Harvard undergraduates, varsity athletes are most satisfied with their social lives, according to the results of the Undergraduate Council’s social life survey.
According to the results, varsity athlete status or membership in a student organization with property had a significant impact on social experience. Organizations with property include final clubs with off-campus spaces and student-run activities that own buildings, like The Crimson and the Harvard Lampoon—a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
Participants could identify with a variety of different categories, like membership in a final club and work-study eligibility. Conducted from Nov. 14 through 19, the survey, which had 1371 respondents, was intended to gauge student opinions of Harvard’s social life.
The results of the web-based poll were presented by Johnny F. Bowman ’11 to the Committee on Student Life during a meeting yesterday morning.
Bowman said that the survey was meant to “essentially just figure out which students are having more fun than others and how we can reach those students.”
Of those surveyed, 62.9 percent were female and 36.5 percent were male. The remaining 0.6 percent identified as transgender, other, or preferred not to name their gender.
The majority of Harvard students reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their social lives.
Two percent of women and about four percent of men reported being “very dissatisfied” with their social lives.
The survey also asked students to identify which factors influenced their decision to stay in their dorm on a given night instead of going out.
Students reported that having too much school work or being too tired were their biggest deterrents from socializing.
Bowman said that he found this result “surprising.” According to him, the UC’s current initiatives target lack of available social space and lack of knowledge about social opportunities, two factors that students ranked lower among their reasons for not going out.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 brought up the results of the freshman survey during the meeting.
He said that the major complaint was a lack of cheap, non-alcoholic social opportunities on campus.
“Freshmen want more free events,” Dingman said. “So many of these are costly—they can’t afford to go to concert after concert.”
To address student concerns with Harvard’s social life, Bowman suggested that the administration consider the possibility of transforming Holyoke Center into a student center, an idea that University President Drew G. Faust has entertained in the past.
He also said that the UC should continue to encourage its Student Initiated Programming fund grant program, which provides funding for medium-sized parties where alcohol may be served.
In addition to reviewing the results of the student life survey, the committee also discussed shifting the date of the activities fair during Opening Days. This academic year, the fair was on the first day of classes, which administrators felt was overwhelming for students—especially for first-year students who had not yet acclimated to Harvard academics.
The revised schedule, presented to the committee, proposed that the fair be shifted to later in the week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College tuition and fees will climb 3.8 percent for the next academic year, reaching a total of $52,650.
The jump in price will be coupled with a $2 million increase in the financial aid budget, bringing the total cost of financial aid to a record high of more than $160 million. More than 60 percent of Harvard undergraduates receive some financial aid from the College.
At the same time that the College announced next year’s tuition price, it revealed plans to bring back the early action admissions program which was cut four years ago out of concern that it disadvantaged low-income students. Today’s announcement affirmed, however, that the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative—another hallmark of the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid’s recent pushes to increase college accessibility and affordability—remains on solid ground for the next year.
Under HFAI, families that earn less than $60,000 per year pay no tuition to send students to Harvard. Students whose families earn up to $180,000 are typically asked to pay no more than 10 percent of the family’s income.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said he was thrilled that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences passed a larger financial aid budget.
“I’ve never been prouder of Harvard,” he said. “At a time like this, to have Harvard’s commitment to financial aid be loud and clear is something that I’m very proud of Harvard for doing.”
“We remain committed to need-blind admissions, in good financial times and bad,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in a statement. “Our investment in financial aid will enable us to continue attracting the world’s most talented students, regardless of their economic circumstances.”
Last year, the College also increased tuition by 3.8 percent. The current academic year was the first year in which Harvard’s sticker price topped $50,000.
The new $52,650 price tag places Harvard’s fee second-to-lowest among the six Ivy League schools which have announced their tuition for the 2011-12 school year. Only Princeton—which raised costs just 1 percent this year and at $49,069 remains the only Ivy League education below $50,000 per year—will charge less than Harvard.
While Brown’s 3.5 percent leap, which brought its total cost to $53,136, was also a less dramatic spike than Harvard’s, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Yale all posted steeper increases—3.9, 4.5, and 5.8 percent, respectively.
The most expensive Ivy League university price announced so far is Cornell’s $54,645 fee. Columbia—which costs over $56,000 for tuition, room, and board during the current school year—and Dartmouth, which this year charged over $52,000, have yet to post their 2011-12 prices.
Peer institutions have also announced increases to their financial aid budgets over the past few months.
Yale announced in December that it would increase its aid budget from $108 million to $117 million while adjusting the way it allocates that aid. Beginning with students who will enter Yale as freshmen this fall, families earning between $130,000 and $200,000 will be asked to pay about 15 percent of their income rather than the former standard of 12 percent. At the same time, students whose family income falls below $65,000 annually—rather than the previous $60,000 cut-off which mirrored Harvard’s—will pay no tuition or fees.
The University of Pennsylvania expanded its financial aid budget by $10.7 million, to $161 million, while Stanford University will boost its aid allotment by about 1 percent to $122 million.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A raucous crowd of about 300 students armed with signs and drums rallied outside the Harvard Kennedy School yesterday—where House Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.) was speaking—in protest of proposed budget cuts that would defund service programs and some social services.
Last Saturday, Republicans passed a budget proposal that would slash $60 billion in federal spending, including funding for AmeriCorps—a service organization—and Planned Parenthood, which provides family planning services across the country.
Kurt Tsuo ’11, who organized the protest with Samuel B. Novey ’11, said that proposed budget cuts could endanger students’ ability to participate in Teach for America, a program that places recent college graduates in low-income schools and receives significant funding from AmeriCorps.
“The budget cuts are an attack on our classmates and the work that they do,” Novey said. “We want to send the respectful message that AmeriCorps members do incredible work in communities.”
Students who rallied outside yesterday’s address by Cantor, who is at the center of Congressional budget negotiations, hailed from a wide range of universities—including Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Columbia, Northeastern, and Wellesley. The protesters demanded the maintenance of AmeriCorps and Planned Parenthood funding and increased funding for global health programs.
The Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition also organized a protest asking Cantor not to support the currently proposed continuing resolution for fiscal year 2011, which would lead to a $1.5 billion cut in global health funding.
During Cantor’s speech inside the Kennedy School, 20 members of the coalition staged a walkout to protest the cuts.
Additionally, members of the Kennedy School Progressive Caucus asked passersby and rally participants to pose for the camera while holding signs saying “this is personal.” The pictures, which are meant to show “the faces of budget cuts,” are displayed on a website—www.mrcantorthisispersonal.tumblr.com.
Annie W. Mathews, a member of the caucus and first year student at the Kennedy School, said the idea for incorporating individuals at the event into the protest came from a friend who felt the proposed budget cuts affected him personally, since he has either contributed to or studied many programs threatened by budget cuts.
In addition to the protest, Caleb E. Jonas, a second year student at the Kennedy School, started an online petition on change.org two weeks ago to ask the Senate to maintain AmeriCorps. Tsou said the petition had received 100,000 signatures as of yesterday afternoon.
Sadie Lansdale, a junior at Tufts University, said she thought it was “pretty telling” that so many student organizations were rallying together.
“These bills that are on the table are defunding [programs advocating for] the rights of the people,” she said.
Cambridge police did not report any arrests during the rally.
“The protesters have been peaceful and very cooperative,” Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello wrote in an e-mail.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a reversal of a bold policy that College administrators once touted as a boon for lower-income students, Harvard and Princeton University both announced yesterday that they will resume the early admissions program for students applying this fall.
Concerned that such programs disadvantaged applicants from underprivileged backgrounds, Harvard—followed by the University of Virginia and Princeton—eliminated early admissions starting for the Class of 2012.
When Harvard announced in 2006 that it would suspend its early admissions program, the University sent shock waves through higher education, and the move was seen as a step forward for increasing access to education.
But in recent months, Harvard administrators have come to reconsider the policy amid concerns that the College may be missing some of the country’s most talented applicants.
“We looked carefully at trends in Harvard admissions these past years and saw that many highly talented students, including some of the best-prepared low-income and underrepresented minority students, were choosing programs with an early-action option, and therefore were missing out on the opportunity to consider Harvard,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in a statement.
Beginning with students applying for the classes of 2016, Harvard and Princeton will both offer a single-choice early action application option. While this practice does not require admitted students to attend, it does prohibit students from applying to other schools’ early action or early decision programs.
But experts said that yesterday’s decision—an abrupt departure from the policy of the past four years—will dramatically alter the college admissions landscape for students seeking spots at highly selective universities.
Experts also question what has changed over the past four years to justify the policy’s return. Early admissions programs have in the past been considered beneficial for traditionally advantaged groups in the college admissions process—such as athletes, legacies, and the children of donors—but it remains unclear whether the return of early admissions will have negative repercussions for lower-income students.
EARLY RETURNS
Even as he was singing the praises of a single admissions cycle five years ago, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that the College might reevaluate its decision within a few years.
“If after several years with a single admissions deadline, we find ourselves needing to reinstate early admission to preserve the quality of our student body, we will return to early action,” he said in the 2006 statement which initially heralded the end of early action.
Describing the elimination as “an experiment” earlier this month, Fitzsimmons reiterated the fact that the decision was always open to review.
Fitzsimmons said that Harvard began seriously considering reinstating early action this past summer. After months of review, the Office of Admissions decided that the upswing in students applying to early programs across the country, as well as students’ desire to gain entry to Harvard earlier in the year, showed a need to resume early admissions at the College.
“We started to hear that more and more people were applying early across the country,” Fitzsimmons said. “Given the uncertainty that an economic downturn entails—people look for the certainty that early admission would provide.” He added that students are especially keen to secure speedy admission to a school with generous financial aid like Harvard.
Fitzsimmons pointed to rising numbers of early applications nationwide as evidence that early action programs have now become available to a larger pool of students than in 2006, when the College did away with the program.
University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement yesterday that the return of early action is now “consistent with our bedrock commitment to access, affordability, and excellence.”
Princeton President Shirley M. Tilghman also said in a statement that she believes that renewing early admissions will allow her school to better recruit students from underrepresented groups.
“By reinstating an early program, we hope we can achieve two goals: provide opportunities for early application for students who know that Princeton is their first choice, while at the same time sustaining and even enhancing the progress we have made in recent years in diversifying our applicant pool,” she said.
Fitzsimmons noted that applicants will gain no additional favor for choosing to apply in the early round rather than the regular cycle.
NO WORM FOR THE EARLY BIRD
When Harvard announced the elimination of early action in 2006, University officials hailed the move as a progressive step that would both help Harvard recruit students from underrepresented groups and ease the stress of the admissions process for students of all backgrounds.
Fitzsimmons told The Crimson in 2006 that the removal of early admission was “certainly a win for students in the bottom quarter and bottom half of the income distribution.”
At the time, the University argued that low-income students were hindered from participating in early admissions programs since they needed to apply to many schools in order to compare financial aid offers from multiple institutions.
In addition, Harvard administrators said that wealthier students had greater access to the resources needed to put together a successful college application by the Nov. 1 early action deadline.
“Early admission programs tend to advantage the advantaged,” then-Interim University President Derek C. Bok said in a statement. “Students from more sophisticated backgrounds and affluent high schools often apply early to increase their chances of admission, while minority students and students from rural areas, other countries, and high schools with fewer resources miss out.”
At the time of the announcement, Harvard administrators said that they hoped that many top universities would follow in Harvard’s footsteps, but only Virginia and Princeton did away with their early decision programs.
Some experts said that while the prestige of schools like Harvard and Princeton allowed them to eliminate early admission, other schools could not do so without significantly damaging the quality of their applicant pools.
“Other schools can’t afford to do away with early,” Amy Sack, president of admissions consulting company Admissions: Accomplished, said in an interview with The Crimson yesterday. “An early plan is very important to some schools, though it’s not maybe to schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or Stanford,” which high-caliber high school seniors will apply to regardless of their application deadlines.
Despite the fact that only two schools mimicked Harvard’s policy during the past five years, independent Conn. college counselor Gay S. Pepper said she believes that Harvard changed the admissions climate for the better by temporarily eschewing early admissions.
“It sent a real shock wave. A lot of colleges realized that early decision wasn’t benefiting the students. Many colleges started [non-binding] early action programs instead,” Pepper said. “It was a very daring move.”
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD?
According to admissions experts, the reinstatement of early admissions programs at both Harvard and Princeton will fundamentally alter the dynamics of college admissions.
“This is a seismic shift,” said Michael Goran, director and educational consultant at IvySelect, a college counseling firm in California. “I really do believe that it creates a new dynamic.”
The four institutions that many consider the nation’s preeminent universities—Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford—now all offer non-binding single-choice early action programs. According to college counselors, students hoping to attend one of these schools are now likely to apply early to their first choice and attend if admitted, rather than apply to more schools and make up their minds in May.
“I think it will be the most earth-shattering for Yale,” said Sack, saying that in the past five years, students often applied early to Yale even if Harvard or Princeton was their first choice. Next year, Sack hypothesized, Yale’s early applications will decrease as those students migrate to Harvard and Princeton.
Experts said that Harvard stands to directly benefit from the new policy and will likely see a higher yield in the future.
“You’re not committed to the school, but at the end of the day, chances are you have already psychologically committed by applying early action in the first place,” Goran said, arguing that Harvard can now draw top students through its early action program.
Others were skeptical of the College’s claim that the reinstated early program will be equally accessible to students from diverse backgrounds. Cigus Vanni, a guidance counselor at Cherry Hill High School in New Jersey, said that early admission has traditionally been used to guarantee admission to athletes, legacies, and the children of donors as quickly as possible. Predicting that this trend will start again with the rebirth of Harvard’s early action program, Vanni said that having these candidates in the pool may boost the early admission rate, causing acceptance during the early cycle to appear deceptively easy.
Current applicants to the College interviewed by The Crimson yesterday reported that they would have applied early to Harvard had the option been available.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six feet tall. Left-handed. From Long Island, N.Y.
Men’s lacrosse co-captain Dean Gibbons and junior Jeff Cohen have a lot in common.
But most of all, the dynamic duo knows a thing or two about scoring. The attackmen have combined for 111 goals over the past two seasons—42 percent of Harvard’s scores during that time.
The pair has been putting the ball in the net with ease since playing for rival high schools in Nassau County.
“Lacrosse on Long Island is very competitive,” Gibbons explained. “There’s a lot of talented schools out there. You become a better player playing against talented competition. That’s helped my game and Jeff’s game.”
Gibbons, from Garden City, N.Y., starred in football and lacrosse before arriving in Cambridge. An All-American in lacrosse in 2006 and 2007, Gibbons finished his career as the owner of the Long Island single-season scoring record with 101 goals and tied with former Crimson attack Max Motschwiller ’09 as Long Island’s career scoring leader with 236 goals.
Along came Cohen, from Syosset, N.Y., also a football and lacrosse star. By the end of his high school career, he, like Gibbons, was a two-time All-American, and he had broken his future teammate’s all-time scoring mark with 260 goals.
But despite Cohen breaking his record, Gibbons always admired his fellow attackman’s talent in high school, a sentiment Cohen shared.
“We actually played together the summer going into my junior year, so we knew each other pretty well,” Cohen said. “I looked at him as a role model figure...I was always kind of competing with him and looking up to him.”
Gibbons came to Harvard in 2008 after being named a Top 15 Incoming Freshman by Inside Lacrosse Magazine and immediately made an impression, finishing second on the team with 28 points.
Cohen arrived a year later with the same distinction and did not disappoint. Following in the footsteps of his brothers—Crimson lacrosse alums Steve ’06 and Greg ’07—the freshman led the team with 34 goals and 41 points while being named the New England Rookie of the Year. Gibbons was second on the team in both categories.
Last season, it was Gibbons who led the squad with 41 points on 27 goals and was named to the All-Ivy Second Team. Cohen finished ahead of his teammate in scores with 29 but behind him in points with 37.
The duo stresses the importance of staying in shape, remaining disciplined, and playing hard at all times as the secret to its success.
In 2011, Gibbons and Cohen will get the chance to put their goal-scoring ability to the test in a new offensive system, and their rookie head coach is happy to have them both.
“Dean’s our quarterback; he’s the leader of our offense,” said Chris Wojick ’96, a former lacrosse All-American and captain. “He really gets everything going—the other players really feed off him...Jeff is an excellent shooter with range. He’s not just a finisher; he’s got a really powerful shot from the outside as well.”
The pundits recognize their talent too. Gibbons was named a preseason All-American honorable mention heading into his senior year.
“Dean is the total package because he is a great dodger, a great shooter, and he’s also a great passer,” Wojick said. “There are a lot of players who can do one or two of [those things]. There aren’t a lot of players who are exceptional in all three areas.”
Despite their mutual talent, both stars have taken different approaches to their attack that distinguishes them from each other.
“I’m more of an off-ball player,” Cohen said. “Dean’s more of a creative player, so a lot of times I’m trying to create space for him...I think we have a pretty good connection here.”
Once competitors, the two attackmen now see the added benefits each receives from having the other as a teammate.
“Every week, defenses have to game plan for Dean,” Cohen said. “He’s always getting the other team’s top defender. Having that takes a lot of the burden off me. He’s such a great player...I think he’ll have a huge season.”
“Jeff helps the offense in a lot of ways,” Gibbons added. “He’s an excellent shooter...Having one guy on the field who you know can score from a lot of different areas is very helpful to the offense overall and definitely takes a lot of stress off others.”
Heading into this season, the individual competition for the team’s scoring title is up for grabs in what should be a fast-paced offense under Wojick.
“We’re going to play more of an up-tempo style this year, which is really exciting,” Cohen said. “That’s the most fun type of lacrosse to play. I think we’re going to be a team that scores a lot of goals [and] runs up and down the field.”
Two great scorers plus a run-and-gun offense? Safe to say Harvard Stadium won’t be a fun place for opposing goalies to play this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s lacrosse team takes the field this Sunday in its season opener against No. 13 Stanford, there will be quite a few fresh faces in crimson. In total, 11 Crimson freshmen will make their collegiate debut.
And if Harvard is to contend in the Ivy League, its rookies will need to rise to the occasion.
This fact is not lost on the squad’s veterans, who expect the class of 2014 to play a key role from the get-go.
“People are going to be called on to step up no matter what class they’re in, no matter what game it is,” junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind said.
While such lofty expectations might trouble some rookies, the Harvard freshmen claim they are ready to contribute.
One rookie expected to make an immediate impact on the field this season is Jenn Leffew. An attacker and midfielder from Vero Beach, Fla., Leffew has already earned the admiration of her more experienced teammates.
“I love Leffew,” sophomore attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “We work really well together. She sees the field fantastically. She knows how to finish the ball, and her whole field sense is great. She’s an amazing feeder, and that’s why I love her.”
VanderMeulen made an impact of her own as a first-year player, taking home the 2010 Ivy League Rookie of the Year award after leading the conference in goals. VanderMeulen is eager to see if Leffew can carry on the tradition this season.
“I already told her, ‘Leffew, we’ve got to keep [the Rookie of the Year title] in the family. I’m going to need to pass it down to you, so you better have a good season,’” VanderMeulen said with a smile.
If Leffew hopes to earn the title this season, she will need to make a quick adjustment to the collegiate game—something all of Harvard’s freshmen acknowledge as a challenge.
“The biggest transition was the pace, the speed of play,” freshman defender Alexa Buckley said. “It all took some getting used to, but the upperclassmen made the transition easier. They made us feel like we were a part of the team.”
With junior defender Chelsea Bowen nursing an injury, Buckley is expected to get a lot of playing time this season. She will be called upon to bolster the Crimson defense, and her teammates believe she is ready for the task.
“She’s definitely made an impact on the defense,” VanderMeulen said. “She’s one of those freshmen who is going to take a leading role.”
The potential for making an impact on the field is what made many of the freshmen choose Harvard over offers from other schools.
Freshman midfielder and defender Lauren Tomkinson passed up offers from Cornell and Penn to play for the Crimson. Tomkinson wanted the opportunity to be a part of the growing program under Harvard coach Lisa Miller. She and her classmates are happy with their choice to join the Crimson and have already developed a strong bond.
“We’re all each other’s best friends,” said freshman attacker and midfielder Chelsey Newman. “I know they are there for me when things get tough or hard. I don’t think I could do it without them. Having best friends on the team makes the two-hour practices fun.”
The camaraderie has extended beyond the class of 2014 to the more experienced players. According to the freshmen, their older teammates have been supportive since they arrived at Harvard.
“They were given a lot of freshmen, and they’ve done a great job of not alienating us,” Buckley said. “They’ve taken us under their wings and have been role models for all of us. I feel comfortable talking to them, not just about lacrosse.”
Tri-captains Baskind, Sam McMahon, and junior Tyler Petropulos have been particularly helpful to the rookies as they find their places on the team.
“I especially look up to the captains,” Newman said. “They’re so supportive—they want us to be the best players that we can be so that we’re the best team we can be,”
The team is optimistic that it will be a contender in the Ivy League this season, despite boasting a relatively young roster.
“We’re going into this season as the underdogs,” Leffew said. “The lacrosse world doesn’t want to give us a chance, but we have a great team. When we put it all together, we’re going to shock some people. We’ve got nothing to lose and a lot to gain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse class of 2013 arrived on campus last fall with high expectations.
From game one, four players from Crimson coach Lisa Miller’s second recruiting class were featured in the starting lineup and were expected to put up numbers.
The group did not disappoint.
By the season’s end, the Harvard rookies combined for 112 of the Crimson’s 176 goals—good for 64 percent. Two Crimson freshmen picked up all-Ivy honors, while Jennifer VanderMeulen earned the Ivy League Rookie of the Year award.
But entering the 2011 season, expectations are even higher for Harvard’s class of 2013.
If the Crimson is to qualify for the Ivy League playoffs—something it fell one game short of doing in 2010—and to make a run at the conference title, it will need its sophomores to not only produce on the field, but also to step into new leadership roles.
“I think with the task that we were given freshman year, we stepped up to the challenge,” said VanderMeulen, who notched a league-leading 56 goals during her rookie campaign. “I think we’re ready to step up as leaders ourselves and take control.”
Part of taking on new leadership responsibilities has meant guiding the Crimson’s latest crop of 11 freshmen, helping them adjust to college lacrosse, and teaching them Harvard’s system.
“I think [the sophomores] are talking a lot more,” tri-captain Sam McMahon said. “In the huddles, they’ll say, ‘No, you’re supposed to be there’—they’ll cold call people.”
But according to junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind, the legacy left by the group has been almost as valuable as its words.
“The freshmen last year definitely set the example in terms of [showing that] everyone on this team is the same grade once you get on the field,” Baskind said. “If anything, it’s setting the tone for every class to come. I think the freshmen this year have certainly seen how that happened last year and the potential role that there is to play.”
And on the field, Harvard’s sophomores could be even more dangerous than a season ago.
VanderMeulen, a 5’8” lefty attacker, spent the summer and preseason developing her right hand in anticipation of new defensive strategies that she expects opposing coaches to throw at her.
“[Being left-handed] was definitely to my advantage last year because people generally didn’t know me, so I could go left every time,” VanderMeulen said. “I’ve definitely been working a lot on my right hand.”
But even with her improved skill set, VanderMeulen understands that she might not be able to post 56 goals again this season, given the expected return of junior attacker Jess Halpern, who suffered a season-ending knee injury a year ago, and the addition of talented freshman attacker Jenn Leffew.
According to VanderMeulen, that is not a problem.
“Last year, I was definitely lacking in my assist column. I don’t like that. I like team offense,” said VanderMeulen, who finished 2010 with 10 assists. “[If] instead of having 56 goals, I have 30 goals and 20 assists, I would much rather prefer that.”
Micaela Cyr and Danielle Tetreault are two of VanderMeulen’s classmates who should reap the benefits of the attacker’s focus on distributing the ball.
Last season, Cyr—a 5’6” midfielder—got off to a slow start but ended the year with a bang, notching 11 goals in the Crimson’s final five contests. Cyr finished the season third on the Harvard squad in scoring with 19 goals and first in draw controls with 36. For her strong finish, Cyr received an All-Ivy honorable mention.
Tetreault also had a solid rookie campaign, totaling 20 goals and 10 assists.
But both Tetreault and Cyr’s numbers could see a bump this season.
“Everyone has stepped up so much. Danielle and Micaela come to mind at the moment, because they’re not afraid to go to goal,” VanderMeulen said. “I think our season last year gave them so much more confidence.”
But Tetreault, Cyr, and VanderMeulen aren’t the only three sophomores expected to make a major impact for the Crimson this year.
Nina Kucharczyk, who entered the starting lineup midway through the 2010 season, should see increased playing time at midfield from game one this spring.
“Nina is one of the fastest people I know,” Tetreault said. “No one can catch her when she decides to go to goal.”
If the Crimson is to improve on last year’s 3-4 conference record, it will need its talented sophomore class to step up—whether on the field or in a leadership role.
“We took it pretty hard on ourselves to lose...big games or make rookie mistakes [last year],” VanderMeulen said. “We’re not going to make the same mistakes this year. We’ve been through a season, and we know what it’s like. We don’t want to play the youth card anymore.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Chris Wojcik ’96 stands in Harvard Stadium on a chilly winter afternoon, yelling out instructions to his 44-member team during a weekday practice, he can’t help but feel as if he’s been here before.
Fifteen years ago, it was this very stadium that he called home, where he excelled on the field in more ways than one.
After a distinguished athletic career at Harvard in which he earned All-American accolades in lacrosse and All-Ivy distinction in lacrosse and soccer, Wojcik is finally back in the very place he started.
“I have very fond memories of playing soccer and lacrosse at Harvard,” Wojcik said. “It meant a whole lot to me. The wins and dealing with adversity, really just everything that went into the whole journey of a season and the relationships you build.”
As a player, Wojcik enjoyed success almost unparalleled in Crimson lacrosse history. By his senior year in 1996, with Wojcik captaining the squad, Harvard reached the No. 5 national ranking in the country and the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament.
“Our senior class really brought the program forward,” Wojcik said. “We got better and better each year, so it was great to finish our careers on a high note with one of the best seasons Harvard’s ever had.”
From 2002 through 2007, Wojcik—a member of the New Jersey Lacrosse Hall of Fame—returned to Harvard as an assistant under former head coach Scott Anderson, spending three years as a recruiting coordinator and two years as an offensive coordinator. In 2006, the Wojcik-led Crimson offense earned Harvard’s first tournament berth since the coach’s senior season 10 years earlier.
Wojcik then moved on to Bowdoin College, where he served as the Polar Bears’ offensive coordinator in 2008, when the team went to its first-ever NCAA tournament. In 2009, he took a job as the top assistant coach at Penn, where he worked for two years as the Quakers’ recruiting and offensive coordinator.
Then, on July 12 of last year, Wojcik finally had his big break. After John Tillman left for the University of Maryland following three up-and-down seasons at the helm of the Crimson, Wojcik received a call offering him the chance to become the Frisbie Family Head Coach for Harvard men’s lacrosse. He accepted immediately.
“It was a dream job for me to be able to come back to my alma mater and coach,” he said. “From the day I started coaching it was my goal [to return to] Harvard.”
But the man who has been a big part of the Crimson’s last two NCAA tournament appearances has a challenge ahead of him if he is going to make a third.
The 2010 Crimson entered the season ranked No. 12 in the country but did not live up to expectations under Tillman, struggling to a 6-6 record and failing to make the postseason for the fourth straight year.
Despite that disappointment, the new head coach is setting high expectations for his first season at the helm.
“We want to improve as the year goes on,” Wojcik said. “We [then] have lofty goals to win the Ivy League, get to the NCAA tournament, and make a statement in the tournament. Those are kind of the long-term goals. [For now], we take it one day at a time, one practice at a time.”
To achieve success, the former offensive coordinator is bringing with him an attack that his players are already raving about.
“We want to play an up-tempo and a fast, exciting brand of lacrosse,” Wojcik said. “I really believe in running the field and trying to play transition lacrosse. That’s what I’m trying to implement, and the guys have responded well to it thus far.”
Junior Jeff Cohen called the new system “exciting.”
“Everything we’ve done with him is very applicable to in-game playing,” senior co-captain Dean Gibbons added.
It’s his familiarity with upperclassmen like Cohen and Gibbons that Wojcik believes has made his transition to head coach easier.
“As an assistant here, I recruited the seniors and juniors,” he said. “I knew their personnel, their skill sets, I knew what their strengths were.”
His players, in return, have appreciated having a leader that understands them better than the average rookie coach would.
“Coach Wojcik is a great coach,” Gibbons said. “He knows the dynamic of the players, [and] he’s extremely intelligent.”
When the season kicks off tomorrow versus Canisius, the coach will lead those players out of the tunnel that he has run through so many times as an attackman and an assistant.
But now, Chris Wojcik has a team he can finally call his own, and he couldn’t be more grateful.
“It just makes it much more special to come back as head coach,” Wojcik said. “I feel really fortunate to come back. I’m going to make the most of it and give it my best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing its 2010 season in style, winning four of its last five games, the Crimson women’s lacrosse team is looking to carry its momentum into the 2011 season.
“We really wanted to go out with a bang, and we did,” sophomore attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “I think we were almost upset that our season ended, because we had just made such progress. We want to pick up from where we left off.”
But this year’s Harvard squad has quite a different look than the one that finished last season. Eleven freshmen are on the Crimson’s roster, and three new assistant coaches have joined Harvard coach Lisa Miller’s staff.
With solid sideline leadership, promising rookies, and talented returners, the Crimson expects this to be an exciting and competitive season.
“We’re going to be a good team,” junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind said. “I think it’s really a question of how good we’ll be and how far we’ll go. We proved our potential in spurts last year, so it’s just a question of consistency and what level we can really take it to.”
Consistency is going to be a necessity for the team, as the schedule ahead of the Crimson is challenging. Harvard will compete against four teams that appeared in last year’s NCAA tournament.
“[It’s a] tough schedule, but I think it’s really exciting more than anything else,” Baskind said. “Knowing that if we can knock off a couple of these teams, it will put our team in a good position in terms of getting recognized and going into Ivy play and hopefully the NCAA tournament,” Baskind said.
The Crimson will begin its 2011 season on Sunday with a match on the road against No. 13 Stanford. Last year, the Cardinals appeared in the NCAA tournament and finished 16th in the nation.
“Looking at the schedule, there’s no easy game,” VanderMeulen said. “I think playing teams at a higher caliber is going to force us to play with them. Overall, I think it will be great for us.”
Harvard will play eight games on the road, four of which are league contests. The Crimson will also challenge six competitors at Harvard Stadium, including Ivy opponents Penn, Yale, and Columbia.
Along the way, the team will be led by tri-captains Baskind, senior defender Sam McMahon, and junior Tyler Petropulos.
“Our captains have been great,” VanderMeulen said. “It’s nice having a leader at every part of the field. They’re really positive, which is really important. They’ve done a great job.”
All three have earned the respect of their teammates through solid play, setting a standard for the rest of the squad across the pitch. McMahon started all fifteen games last year on defense and collected 14 ground balls. Petropulos also started every game as a sophomore and earned honorable mention All-Ivy League honors as a freshman, serving as a solid presence in the attack.
Baskind anchored the midfield for the Crimson, finishing second on the team in goals and points while leading the squad with 41 ground balls and 25 caused turnovers.
VanderMeulen will also look to build upon a successful freshman season. Dangerous in the attack, the lefty recorded 56 goals and eight assists, and her impressive play caused her to be named the 2010 Ivy League Rookie of the Year and to a spot on the All-American third-team by WomensLacrosse.com.
Junior attacker Jess Halpern hopes to soon join these players on the field and to bolster the Crimson’s attack. After being voted Ivy League Rookie of the Year in 2008 and first-team All-Ivy in 2009, Halpern suffered a season-ending knee injury in the second game of her 2010 campaign. If the junior returns to form, she and VanderMeulen will be one of the strongest attack duos in the league.
With so many offensive weapons, the Crimson will focus on improving its defense in preparation for its daunting schedule.
“I think if you look at past years, our strength has always been in the offense,” McMahon said. “I think that’s slowly changing... There’s more of a balance with offense and defense. Our offensive unit is going to be amazing. In practice, I’m wowed every single time they touch the ball. That being said, our defense is really coming together. We’re going to be playing a system where we’re going to be pressuring the opponent.”
Synchronizing its offensive and defensive efforts will require Harvard to develop strong team chemistry on the field, something its players claim is one of its assets.
“Our biggest strength is our teamwork,” VanderMeulen said. “Last year, I felt like there was a lot of individual effort. This year, we’re really starting to come together and to play as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You step onto the field, and the whistle blows. Adrenaline surges through your body as you cut, dodge, check. Nothing matters but the moment, the team, the game. You feel alive. You feel invincible.
But it only takes one moment, one misstep for the limitations of your body to cause you to come crashing back to reality. A snap of a tendon can send you to months of rehab or even to a permanent place on the sideline. You are left with a choice: do you stop playing, or do you spend hundreds of hours training to get another chance at your dream, another opportunity to play the sport you love?
It’s a decision that no athlete ever hopes she will have to make.
In her first two seasons, Harvard attacker Jess Halpern had become a dominant force in the Ivy League. After being named Ivy League Rookie of the Year in 2008, Halpern continued to excel as a sophomore, leading the league in goals and points per game and being named to the All-Ivy League First Team. Coming into her junior season last spring, Halpern was expected to be an integral part of the Crimson attack.
When she walked onto Homewood Field in Baltimore, Md., for the second game of the season—just days after being named to the watch list for the Tewaaraton Trophy, given to the nation’s top collegiate player—Halpern figured the match against Johns Hopkins would be like any other game.
After recording two second-half goals in the match, Halpern received the ball and ran down the sideline with one defender on her back and another running toward her from the front. Halpern planted her right foot to do a split dodge, but as she cut got a push from behind, and her knee buckled in.
“I knew right when it happened that something awful had happened to my knee,” Halpern said. “I heard and felt my knee crunch and pop, and I just collapsed. I immediately knew I could have torn my ACL.”
After taking her off the field, the trainer confirmed Halpern’s suspicions that it was most likely an ACL tear.
“I was living out my biggest fear,” Halpern said. “I was freaking out to think that I would be out for the season. It was a shock and super surreal for me.”
While waiting in the airport, Halpern called Lauren Bobzin ’08, who had been captain her freshman year, for advice and support.
“She was the first to suggest that I could red shirt,” Halpern said. “She said how in the long run it could be better for the team, better for me, and really a blessing in disguise. Talking to her, I realized that I really wanted to play another season of lacrosse.”
After confirming a few days later through an MRI that she had torn the ACL and sprained the MCL in her right knee, the decision was easy. Giving up a season or quitting wasn’t an option, and Halpern was ready for the rehab process to begin. She confirmed a few weeks later that she was taking the semester off and red-shirting.
After undergoing surgery in May, the true work began.
Remaining determined through months of daily strengthening, conditioning, and rehab, her dedication was obvious to her teammates.
“You can see how badly she wants to be out there,” junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind said. “She shows a lot of dedication in her treatments.”
The greatest obstacle and reward in the recovery process was when she ran for the first time after her surgery.
“I was so nervous to run,” Halpern said. “I had to learn how to run evenly all over again. It’s hard because as much as it’s a physical game, it’s also a mental game. I had felt trapped and bad to not be able to do all of these physical things. I was going crazy, because I wanted to play so badly. I wanted to go out, dodge, run, and be free. Once I took those first steps, I felt free again for the first time.”
Halpern began to show a lot of progress, and after about sixth month’s worth of training after her surgery, she was able to practice with the team again.
“The year that I wasn’t playing, I felt that there was a void inside of me,” Halpern said. “I hated being on the sideline and not being able to be out there. It took a toll on my mind, but I tried to channel that energy through working really hard in my rehab and to make sure my knee was 100 percent when I came back.”
Although practices had been going well, Halpern found out three weeks ago that she had sprained the same MCL once again. But despite the setback, Halpern is expected to take the field for the Crimson in one to two weeks.
Knowing everything that she has been through, Halpern’s teammates look forward to her return.
“Jess is almost a once in a lifetime player,” sophomore attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “She gets so much pressure, so much attention, yet she blows by everyone. She’s the type of player you admire. She’s fantastic. Hopefully she’ll be out there soon and ready to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men’s lacrosse team chases a berth to the NCAA tournament, every game will be important in its pursuit of the Ivy League title or an at-large invitation.
The 2011 campaign begins at home tomorrow afternoon versus Canisius. The Crimson plays its opening home games at the Soldiers Field Soccer and Lacrosse Stadium before making its way over to Harvard Stadium for a battle against UMass on March 29.
Harvard opens its Ivy League schedule on March 19 at Brown. The Crimson has a tough Ivy League schedule this year, including important contests at home against Cornell on April 9 away at Princeton on April 23, and at home against Yale on April 30. Harvard’s contest against the Big Red will be televised on CBS College Sports,  a game that will give the Crimson a chance to shine against the 2010 Ivy League Co-Champions.
“We’re learning from the previous two seasons, but it definitely feels a little different,” junior co-captain Kevin Vaughn said. “It feels a little fresh; it feels like we’re going to do well, and we expect to.”
Harvard also plays a tough match against the Tigers, winners of the 2010 Ivy League Tournament.
The team closes the season with its traditional rivalry game against Yale. The Crimson squeezed out a close 10-9 victory over Yale last season.
“As a team, we just have to stay mentally disciplined,” junior co-captain Dean Gibbons said.  “[We have to] take advantage of opportunities—definitely be aggressive on the field, but be smart with the ball and not make any turnovers.”
Wojcik is leading men’s lacrosse in his first year as a head coach. For the past two years, Wojcik was an assistant coach at Penn and proved his merits as an assistant coach and a recruiter for the Quakers.  Before Penn, Wojcik worked as an assistant coach for the Harvard lacrosse team, serving as offensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator from 2005 to 2007.
Wojcik will look for leadership help from his two experienced co-captains, Gibbons and Vaughn, to help lead the Crimson into the 2011 campaign. Gibbons, an attacker, was an Inside Lacrosse Preseason All-American honorable mention. He tallied 27 goals and 41 points during the 2010 season.
Vaughn, the other co-captain, started all 12 games and netted 15 goals and 23 assists last year. He proved to be a clutch performer by netting two game-winning scores during the 2010 season.
“We’re expecting big things [this season],” Vaughn said. “We want to be very successful, but at the same time we know we want to have a lot of fun doing it. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job of that.”
But the captains won’t be the only ones with increased leadership responsibilities, as all the upperclassmen look to step into larger roles.
Juniors Daniel DiMaria and Terry White lead the 17 upperclassmen into the 2011 season. Both DiMaria, a defenseman, and White, a midfielder, were named to the NEILA preseason team. White netted 13 goals and six assists during the 2010 season.
Junior Jeff Cohen played a big role in the 2010 season as an attacker, starting every game. Cohen led the team with 29 goals, and the team will look to him as an offensive threat for next year.
“As a team, I think we’re trying to improve on coming out and playing hard everyday,” Cohen said. “We’re trying to run up and down and be a kind of run and gun kind of team.  We have to be in good shape.”
Last year’s heralded freshman class will also be looking to take on increased roles and expectations as it heads into its second seasons.
Leading the sophomores, Alex White played in every game last season and netted six goals and six assists.  Peter Schwartz also had a significant role during his freshman season, netting three scores and six assists for the Crimson in only seven appearances.
Ten freshmen join the lacrosse team this spring, seven of whom earned U.S. Lacrosse All-America honors for their success in high school.
The recruiting class was ranked ninth in the nation by Inside Lacrosse Magazine, and is already starting to mount recognition, including John Rose’s selection as the NEILA Rookie of the Year.
“It’s a new era for Harvard Lacrosse,” Rose said. “I think we’re a team that has a lot of depth, a lot of potential, and we know it this year.”

Returning the top four scorers to any team would be the cause for lofty preseason expectations. The Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s returning talent hasn’t gone under the radar—the media has noticed, slotting the Crimson at No. 16 in the LaxNews Preseason Poll.
Yet old faces aren’t everything, especially coming off of a somewhat disappointing 2010 campaign that saw Harvard go 6-6 overall and 2-4 in conference play. Add an entirely new coaching staff into the mix, led by Chris Wojcik ’96, and there are many uncertainties heading into the 2011 season.
Yet these ambiguities leave plenty of room for the highly touted 2011 freshman class to make an immediate impact.
“I think that the freshman class is very talented,” Wojcik said. “They’re also great kids of high character. I think they will have a significant impact on this program pretty quickly. There will probably be at least three of them who will probably play significant minutes this year.”
Ranked ninth by Inside Lacrosse, the freshman class may not boast one obvious standout newcomer, but is noteworthy for its considerable depth—the publication ranks four of the 10 freshmen in the list of top-100 recruits.
“They’re a very hardworking crew,” junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan said.  “They’re not really flashy guys. They’re not a lot of guys that are going to wow anybody. At the same time, they are a lot of guys that are really hard workers. They really play well between the lines—they do a lot of dirty work.”
This depth and consistency might prove to be  more valuable than raw talent alone. Increased depth will serve to make practices more competitive and to more accurately simulate live-game situations.
“Everyone has a clean slate,” Vaughan said. “There are guys jockeying for positions at the attack, midfield, defense, and goalie, so there is this new air about our team where everyone is fresh, [and] loves playing lacrosse right now. We’re just having a ton of fun.”
Freshman attack Carl Zimmerman is one such attackman jockeying for playing time. Hailing from Homer, N.Y., Zimmerman is the most highly-ranked freshman in the class, slotted at No. 30 by Inside Lacrosse. He lays claim to the Homer High School scoring record with 188 goals and 267 points in only three years of action. Zimmerman, along with Garrett Campbell, are the only two attackmen in the freshmen class. Both will be valuable additions to the Crimson’s already strong offensive unit.
Freshman long-stick midfielder John Rose, from Locust Valley, N.Y., will also likely have an immediate impact. Ranked 35th of the top-100 recruits, Rose helped Deerfield Academy to a 65-3 record. Rose was also named to the New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association Preseason Team and the Preseason Rookie of the Year.
“I mean, obviously, it’s a great award, but you have to stay humble.” Rose said. “There is not one guy that is going to carry the team on his back...I’m just going to keep doing what I’m doing, trying to help out the team.”
Another freshman expected to be vying for minutes from game one is midfielder Eric Slingerland, who is ranked 43rd of the top-100 recruits. Hailing from Beverly, Mass., Slingerland holds the Phillips Exeter Academy record for most career goals scored by a midfielder with 154.
Yet the high level of talent doesn’t mean the transition will be easy for the incoming class.
“The biggest jump for freshmen is to be able to make the jump physically, into the speed of the game,” Wojcik said. “A lot of them made significant strides getting stronger, getting faster, getting in better shape.”
“For a few of them, their development has been accelerated by physical development. Now they’re in a position where they can compete college lacrosse-wise,” Wojcik added.
Yet the freshmen won’t be making the transition alone.
“[The upperclassmen] have been great,” Rose said. “They’ve really done a great job of welcoming us and creating a family atmosphere among the entire team.”
“The freshmen really pick up on the mentality of the upperclassmen every single year,” Vaughan said. “So the juniors and seniors have a big hand in framing the mentality of the freshmen class.”
The better the transition for the freshmen, the more likely that the Crimson will be able to live up to its high expectations.
“We’re hungry, as a team and the coaching staff as well,” Rose said. “We’re going to make some noise this year.”

High school hockey star Devin Tringale recently committed to Harvard. The 17-year-old Medford native is currently a junior at Lawrence Academy in Groton, Mass.
“Everyone’s excited,” Tringale said of committing to play for the Crimson. “We’re obviously pumped up about it.”
A lifelong devotee of the sport, Tringale started playing hockey at age four.
“Hockey is huge in my family," he said. "My dad was a coach of Medford High, and he taught me how to skate.”
He joked about how when he was younger he went through a period of hating hockey but kept playing thanks to his parents' encouragement.
“Thank God,” he said.
When Tringale was looking at schools, Harvard was at the top of his list.
“When I started having contact with the coaches, I just knew it was my number one choice," he said. “I’ve been talking to them for about a year now, and when they gave me an offer, I was ecstatic...I called up Coach Donato and accepted the next day.”
Tringale and the Spartans are currently 20-8.
“I pride myself in hard work and being a good team player,” Tringale said.
Tringale expressed enthusiasm for Harvard life outside of the rink as well.
“It’s an incredible education—the doors that it opens when you go to Harvard.” He added, “To be playing for Harvard, in the ECACs, and be able to be in the Beanpot is really exciting.”

This weekend will serve as a turning point for a number of Harvard squads as they prepare for postseason play.
First, the track & field and swimming teams head out to compete in their Ivy League Conference Championship meets. For many of these athletes, this weekend will be their last opportunity to compete as a team before national competition begins.
The men’s and women’s basketball teams have double-headers again this weekend, with the men’s team visiting Brown on Friday and Yale on Saturday. The men hope to close out the road portion of their schedule on a high note, before hosting Princeton and Penn next weekend.
The women, meanwhile, are set to host Brown and Yale this weekend, as they look to secure an NCAA berth.
The women’s ice hockey squad begins the ECAC quarterfinals against St. Lawrence in a best-of-three series to determine a spot in the semifinals. The men play two crucial games against Clarkson and St. Lawrence, finishing out the regular season before ECAC postseason play begins next weekend.
The women’s water polo team heads to Pennsylvania for the ECAC Championship. Harvard opens the weekend with a first-round match against Brown, and will then face either Iona or Bucknell on Saturday. If the Crimson, seeded sixth coming into the Championship, earns victories in its first two matchups, it will square off in the finals on Sunday.
The skiing team heads to the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Championships for its final race of the season. The team is looking to build upon recent success after finishing ninth in the Middlebury Carnival.
The women’s and men’s lacrosse teams open their seasons against non-conference opponents. The women will travel out to sunny Palo Alto, Calif., for a game against No. 13 Stanford on Sunday. The men open on Sunday as well against Canisius at home.

If you’ve ever wanted to see an unstoppable force descend on the Cambridge area, look no further. The College Squash Association’s national championship is right around the corner, and Harvard is right in the mix this weekend.
“I think the team is as prepared as we could be,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “A couple of players have little twinges here and there, which is normal at this point in the season, but we’re ready to go, and certainly, we’ve got the right mindset.”
Vying for the Potter Cup, the highest esteem in all of college squash, No. 6 Harvard (7-5, 3-3 Ivy) is pitted against stern competition on its three-match march to the title.
The squad faces Ancient Eight rival No. 3 Princeton (10-2, 5-1 Ivy) in the first round, this afternoon at 2 p.m. in the Murr Center.
When the two teams last met three weeks ago, the Tigers dashed the Crimson’s hopes of an Ivy League title with a crushing 7-2 victory. This weekend, the tone of Harvard’s tournament opener is quite clear: retribution.
Since losing to Princeton in each of the top-five matchups, the Crimson has fallen to No. 1 Trinity and No. 2 Yale, managing to sneak out a few points against its top-ranked opposition.
The Tigers? They’ve cruised to an easy 8-1 victory over No. 4 Rochester (11-3) and suffered a 6-3 defeat at the hands of No. 1 Trinity (17-0, 1-0 NESCAC).
Still, the squad is optimistic despite its losses against top-ranked teams.
“We’ve really grown as a team and have come together, working hard over the last several months,” said freshman No. 7 Tommy Mullaney, the only squad member to have taken a point from all three of Harvard’s fiercest competitors. “I think everyone’s feeling really excited and enthusiastic about giving it all we’ve got this weekend, from Princeton to whomever comes next.”
As a little more fuel to the fire, if the Crimson were to edge the Tigers in the quarterfinals, it would likely face Ivy League champion and perennial rival No. 2 Yale (13-1, 7-0 Ivy) in a replay of its 7-2 loss just a fortnight ago. The Bulldogs managed to go unbeaten in the Ancient Eight this season, suffering their only loss against the unstoppable Bantams.
With the possibility of facing the three toughest teams in the tournament, the coaching staff is surprisingly calm.
“It’s funny,” said Way of his close competition, “they each finished ahead of us, and rightfully so. They’re definitely where they’re supposed to be. But, we played very well against them, and even though we lost to all of these teams, all of our best matches included them. We’ll just take it one match at a time.”
Undoubtedly, the talk of the tournament will be around No. 1 Trinity, which is looking to grab its 13th consecutive national championship, and is riding the longest winning streak in all of college sports history, currently at 241 games dating back to its first title win in 1998-1999.
For perspective, the last time the Bantams lost—which was to Harvard—SpongeBob still had a year before it would even pilot the airwaves, and the first “Now That’s What I Call Music!” CD in the United States was still a couple months in the future.
That being said, Trinity will be the definite favorite coming into this weekend and would only cross paths with the home team for the title. But, if the two were to meet, counting the Crimson out might not be the safest move. Harvard has claimed the Potter Cup 30 times since 1950, accounting for half of the tournament’s champions in the past 60 seasons of play.
“We’re the underdogs for sure,” Way said. “So mentally, that’s not a bad place to be sometimes. Look for us to come out fighting for it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When people think of the islands of Hawaii, they think of honeymoon vacations and cruises from the West Coast. But for sophomore Aisha and freshman Shayna Price, the island paradise of Hawaii served as a training ground for the rigors of Ivy league athletics. Born only 14 months apart, the two sisters developed a strong bond from their early days of sports in Honolulu.
“From the time we were four years old, we played soccer and basketball together,” Aisha said. “And later when I picked up water polo, Shayna started playing also, so we played on the same team for all our lives.”
The Price sisters, both attackers on the Harvard women’s water polo team, have shown their natural abilities over the course of the season thus far, contributing a total of 39 goals, 18 assists, and 43 steals between the two. The duo has played a big role in the Crimson’s 7-2 start.
Less than two years ago, Shayna and Aisha competed for Punahou High School, whose athletics program was ranked No. 1 in the country by Sports Illustrated in 2008 and 2009. The demanding schedule of their high school’s athletics prepared the girls well for the move to the Ivy League.
“I feel like I had to [practice for long hours] all throughout high school, so sports have really helped me to keep my school work in check,” Shayna said. “In terms of transitions, it’s been very smooth. It’s been a good transition and I’ve been able to manage it.”
Not only does Aisha devote her time to the water polo team, she also plays for the Harvard women’s soccer team. This season, she started six games at the midfield position and scored her first career goal against Dartmouth.
Both say that having a sister on the team has been a huge advantage toward helping them adjust to being away from home.
“We can accredit everything to having a sister on the team,” said Aisha, who was named the water polo team’s Rookie of the Year last season. “We are at this point today from training with each other since we were younger. It’s been the greatest blessing that both of us can come to school together.”
Coming from a very close family, living so far away from home can, at times, be a challenge for the sisters, but it was a difficulty for Aisha eased by Shayna’s arrival on campus this year.
“We owe everything to our parents, who have supported us every step of the way,” Shayna said. “Both of our parents had been at every one of our games all our lives [until leaving home].”
Before and after each game, both sisters call their father, whom they consider one of their coaches, for pep talks and game recaps. Because the flight to Boston from Hawaii is so expensive, their parents have not been able to make the flight out to see them play yet this season.
The Price parents will finally be able to see their daughters play together for the first time as teammates on a Division I college team during spring break when the team will head to California for a tournament.
“They compete very hard, and when they are put on opposing teams in practice, they go crazy going after the ball,” said Harvard water polo coach Ted Minnis. “It’s great to have two sisters who love the game as much as each other and who have fun every play. They have such a natural chemistry, a sisterly bond that extends to the entire team.”
With such an accomplished history shared between the two, Aisha and Shayna have developed an obvious bond in the pool that extends beyond most teammates’ relationships. They have grown to fully understand each other’s playing styles and can anticipate each other’s every move.
“I can really tell when she wants the ball, just by looking at her eyes,” Aisha said. “Then Shayna can rocket it in the goal, because she has a great arm.”
But while this bond can force the sisters to be overly competitive at times, when they step out of the water, Shayna and Aisha put aside their athletic rivalry to focus on what is truly important to them.
“We go very hard against each other, even in practice,” Shayna said, “because we know at the end of the day, we’re still sisters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among all the Ivies, Yale and Brown, at least in my mind, are Harvard’s neighbors. The three New England universities live on the same road, I-95, and the green quads of each punctuate semi-urban communities.
The Bears did the Crimson a big favor last weekend by beating league-leading Princeton, and perhaps the neighborly thing to do would be to show Brown some gratitude. But I won’t, because in my experience, neighbors are rarely neighborly.
Sure, there might be Christmas cards. There might be baskets of fruit. But secretly every person is waiting for a neighbor’s dog to take a steamer on his lawn so that he can let his neighbor have it.
I’ve only had a few neighbors in my life, but each has been a disappointment.
When I was little, our neighbor Jay yelled at me when he caught me throwing fistfuls of mud at my family’s car. MIND YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS, JAY. Fat Lynn lives next door to us now. She just smokes butts on her stoop while giving us the hairy eyeball and daring us to judge her. Here at school, there’s an anonymous student next door who keeps calling HUPD to shut down our parties. Please stop.
To be honest, I’m just as bad a neighbor as anyone. A couple years ago, I accidentally stumbled into my neighbors’ room and yakked all over their bathroom. Sorry girls, I was just being “neighborly.”
Robert Frost put it best: “Good fences make good neighbors.” Maybe from afar, I can appreciate the Bears for handing the Tigers their first league loss. I might have even toasted to them several times last Saturday night. But as their neighbor, I cannot thank them because I know this week Brown will try leave a proverbial turd in Harvard’s punch bowl. The same sentiment holds for Yale. Even more so.
So as the Crimson embarks on its final road trip of the regular season, I hope that Harvard does the “neighborly” thing to the Bears and Bulldogs and embarrasses them on their home front. I can tolerate our neighbors at a comfortable distance, but, when offense and defense are the only “fences,” all congenial feelings fall by the wayside.
HARVARD (20-4, 9-1 Ivy) at Brown (10-14, 3-7 Ivy)
On a couple occasions, I’ve played basketball with Paul Krasinski, the older, less-dashing brother of John Krasinksi, who plays Jim Halpert on “The Office.” The only part of those sloppy pick-up runs relevant to this game is that Paul played for Brown in the late 90s. And given his tangential relationship to “The Office,” I think it’s fitting to declare the Bears the Scranton branch of the Ivy League.
Brown obviously has a couple pieces missing—namely, in and around the paint—but this ragtag bunch has managed to compete with the best, putting a scare in the Crimson and taking down Princeton. And given the mustard-yellow shirt that Bears coach Jesse Agel wore at Lavietes as well as Providence’s own civic decline, I think the Scranton comparison is apt.
As far as tonight goes, I doubt this game will have the drama of its predecessor. Brown forward Peter Sullivan is back after missing the last game against Harvard, and he should supply a much needed post presence. But the Crimson is coming off a weekend during which it was firing on all cylinders. I expect its success to continue.
Pick: Harvard 77, Brown 68
CORNELL (7-17, 3-7 Ivy) at PRINCETON (20-5, 8-1 Ivy)
Every week, it seemed the Tigers were able to eke out a one-possession win, so I was pretty confident the other shoe would drop and some team would eventually beat them. I just didn’t think that team would be Princeton, itself.
Against the Bears last Saturday, the Tigers shot four-of-21 from three and 21-of-55 from the field. They were also one-for-one at shooting themselves in the foot. I’m going to chalk up Princeton’s loss to having an off night as much as a solid Brown effort, and I predict that they right the ship tonight.
Pick: Princeton 74, Cornell 63
COLUMBIA (14-10, 5-5 Ivy) at PENN (11-12, 5-4 Ivy)
This time last week, I was jumping off the Quakers’ bandwagon as their Ivy title hopes went down in flames Hindenburg-style. But last weekend, Penn showed a little pep, winning two tough road games in Providence and New Haven. Tonight, the Quakers have a shot at winning pole position in the race for second runner-up in the conference. It’s small consolation, I’m sure, for seniors Jack Eggleston and Tyler Bernardini, who will retire without hanging any banners, but it’s a carrot nonetheless.
With that in mind, I like Penn for the win at home.
Pick: Penn 71, Columbia 66
DARTMOUTH (5-19, 1-9 Ivy) at YALE (12-12, 5-5 Ivy)
You can’t compete in the Ivy League if you don’t win on your home court, and Yale dropped the ball last weekend by losing a pair at the Amphitheater. Instead of sitting at 7-3, the Bulldogs are middling at 5-5, with no real hope of extending their season beyond March 5. At least they have Dartmouth coming to town. Yale should win in a landslide.
Pick: Yale 68, Dartmouth 56
COLUMBIA at PRINCETON
Columbia was electric last Saturday with Harvard visiting. Levien was packed with students getting fratty on Greek Night. Unfortunately, they deserved a better game. The Crimson cruised for the full 40 minutes, so the Lions’ faithful directed most of its attention towards chanting the names of Sigma Chi brothers.
Columbia’s road does not get any easier, as, after facing Penn, it squares off against Princeton tomorrow.  The Tigers won, 76-46, in their first meeting, and I don’t see why tomorrow’s result should be any different.
Pick: Princeton 75, Columbia 61
CORNELL at PENN
In Ithaca late last Friday night, I went to the Hot Truck, and thoroughly enjoyed my “Double Sui.” It doesn’t make a ton of sense to me that at Cornell—the coldest campus in the Ivies—students need to wait outside for their late night munchies, but at least the food was good. The Big Red might not have the worst cuisine in the league after all. Outside of Dartmouth, though, it might have the worst team. Penn should get a measure of revenge for its loss at Cornell earlier this year.
Pick: Penn 72, Cornell 67
DARTMOUTH at BROWN
This game is like reading for Tangible Things. It doesn’t matter.
Pick: Brown 68, Dartmouth 60
HARVARD at YALE
This game looms as Harvard’s biggest challenge until its final contest against Princeton. If the Crimson can clear this hurdle, it will be poised for a truly epic final weekend at home. I’m willing it to happen with this pick.
Pick: Harvard 69, Yale 66
RECORD LAST WEEK: 5-3 (To date: 24-9)

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and some other schools too).
Three Brown alums are planning on opening a medical marijuana "compassion center" in North Kingston, RI. They have applied to the state for one of three permits that will be issued for such a center. They said they expect to be able to sell their product for as little as $280 per ounce to 600 patients and project their annual revenue to exceed $2 million dollars.
It seems likely that students and professors at Texas colleges and universities will soon be allowed to carry guns on campus. It is predicted that the state will soon pass a law forcing its 38 public universities to let members of the community bring weapons onto campus grounds. There are over 500,000 students in the Texas public higher education system. Many proponents of the change suggest that more guns on campus would reduce the likelihood of a situation similar to what happened at Virginia Tech in 2007. Others however, express reservations about the mix of students, guns, and campus parties.
Students at Penn State raised over $9.5 million to help fight pediatric cancer in a massive dance marathon. The event, sponsored by fraternities and sororities, consisted of 708 students dancing for a total 46 hours. The total this year was almost $2 million more than was raised last year. In the 34 years since it was first held, the event has raised more than $70 million for the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.

With housing day quickly approaching, the average freshman faces many vital questions such as "Are Mather singles really worth the cement?," "Are Quad rooms really that good?," and "Where, exactly, is the Quad?"
 
Anxious freshmen, fret no longer! Stop sneaking into random Kirkland rooms (yes, they really do hold eight people). Instead, let Harvard Rooms do the dirty investigative work for you.
 
This new website—designed by Kevin J. Chin '13 and Kidus T. Asfaw '13, both of Eliot House—allows those who register for the site to view the rooms of other students in the database. In return, users are encouraged to post photos and reviews of their own rooms. Simply click on a House and choose the desired entryway to see the photos and comments.
 
Originally created as a CS50 project last semester, the site launched right before the fair. Despite its early release, hits have only recently started picking up. 
"We need everyone's help to get the site out there," Chin said. "The only way the site will be useful is if everyone works together."

Boloco kicked off its fourteenth "Birthday Bonanza" yesterday with discounted deals, and its location on Mt. Auburn Street will offer special deals each day for the next two weeks.
"We try to do something different every year," said Sal A. Farulla, Boloco’s general manager. "This one was to give everyone something different on a daily basis for 14 days because it's our fourteenth year."
If the thought of a burrito is making your mouth water, simply visit Boloco's website during the next two weeks to learn the code name for each day's unique deal, which were inspired by patrons on their Facebook page.
"It's always good to meet the kids from the area. That's what grew our business from day one," Sal said. "We want to make people feel like Boloco is theirs as opposed to just self-serving."
