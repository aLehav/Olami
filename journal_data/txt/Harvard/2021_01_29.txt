After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the Biden relations whose coats were compared to Neapolitan ice cream (all of whom looked fantastic) to Ella Emhoff’s Miu Miu bedazzled tweed coat to the rainbow of purple worn by three of the most recognizable women in the United States, President Joe Biden’s inauguration was, perhaps, the biggest fashion event of the past several months. And to those who are doubtful of its significance, the answer is clear — fashion is absolutely a political statement, laden with meaning, and will continue to be for as long as people wear clothes.
Blue-purple, maroon-purple, and close-to-royal purple: Vice President Kamala Harris, Michelle Obama, and Hillary Clinton each presented their takes on the eye-catching color. In ancient Rome, purple was the color of the ruling classes, though it now has additional meanings and imparts further emphases — Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for office, made it central to her campaign. Amanda Gorman’s lemon-yellow coat was spellbinding; notably, yellow opposes purple on the color wheel and was also one of Chisholm’s campaign colors.
What does all this mean? Many have opined, and so will I. At the most basic level, it is impossible to believe that the sartorial choices of the inauguration were accidental. All the much-photographed individuals knew they would be much-discussed and much-dissected after the event. The inauguration was the chance to say something — regardless of what that something was. Dr. Biden emphasized sustainability with label Markarian, while Harris and Obama highlighted Black designers.
The implication of statements like “it’s shallow to focus on fashion when there are bigger issues at hand” misses the point. Yes — in the broad scheme of things, in “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs,” the type of clothes aren’t nearly as important as their mere existence, to say nothing of food, water, and shelter. But within the context of the inauguration, and in comparably high profile events, people dress with intention. That is, they do so with the desire to communicate values, beliefs, preferences, and personal quirks. Fashion, as perceivably shallow as some might believe it to be, tells other people about us — information that, be it “positive” or “negative,” has its own narrative.
While fashion can be a political statement, the slippery slope appears when it is used to judge the competence, integrity, or merit of the person in question. Often, this phenomenon happens to women, though plenty of people vilified President Barack Obama when he donned a tan suit. (The incident even has its own Wikipedia page; by contrast, nobody seemed to criticize Ronald Reagan when he wore his own tan suits.) For women, the classic situation of “damned if you, damned if you don’t” can be quick to rear its ugly head: Show up in heels, and one is trying too hard. Show up in loafers and a pantsuit, and it means one is too aggressive. Show up without makeup, and one is not presentable enough. It is difficult to win the game, but it is naive to believe that the game itself does not exist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan. 20, nearly every household across the United States watched the inauguration of President Joe Biden. Damp-haired from the shower and with cinnamon oatmeal in hand, I dropped onto the couch between my parents to watch as well. Truth be told, my family is a family of various priorities. My father came into the living room to watch Joe Biden morph into President on the 40-inch screen. My mother took a break from stirring the pot of black beans to comment on Jennifer Lopez’s hair. And I, the former high school slam poet, ate my breakfast, waiting for the inaugural poem.
Then came Amanda S. Gorman ’20, the 22 year-old poet and activist in a yellow coat, to stand in front of the podium. For roughly five minutes, she spoke of hurt and hope, of history and legacy. Halfway through, my mother’s voice betrayed her shock. “She’s so young!”
My mother’s sentiment has reverberated across the internet. News outlets, from the New York Times to The Jakarta Post, conclude: Gorman was an unexpected but welcome addition to the inauguration ceremony. The Guardian goes so far as to claim that Gorman reminded them that politics needs poetry. I, on the other hand, think that Gorman’s presence on the 21st only reinforced what adolescent writers already know: The world needs young poets.
It makes sense that the broader public — people like my mother who do not regularly read poetry — was shaken into the realization that poetry is important work, that young poets are powerful and capable of change. Young poets aren’t regularly splashed across television screens as, say, college football players are, making it easy to go decades without encountering their work. After hearing Gorman read “The Hill We Climb,” it’s easy to look at the uncovered obvious and ask, how did we miss this?
Until Gorman’s inaugural poem, many people were missing out on this: the power of the youth and their poetry. Preteens, adolescents, and young adults have been meaningfully sharing their emotions, thoughts, and ideas through stanzas long before Gorman’s inaugural address dominated headlines. Urban Word, the organization that runs the Youth Poet Laureate Program, is a literary arts and youth development nonprofit that has spotlighted young poets since 2008. Since Gorman’s National Youth Poet Laureateship, several others have held the title, including Patricia Frazier, Kara Jackson and Meera Dasgupta, not to mention the hundreds of poets recognized at the regional and local levels.
Organizations like Urban Word don’t just do the invaluable work of identifying the next giants of the literary landscape, but they also lend young poets the opportunity to seriously hone their craft. They treat poetry, along with performance poetry, with the respect it so rightfully deserves. As a result, literary arts organizations are often the first space where young poets feel their writings will be received with something more than a skeptical snort.
Gorman’s presence at the inauguration ceremony, in turn, lends legitimacy to poetry from the young; she puts a face to the ever-growing number of seventh graders who want to be writers, the middle and high schoolers secretly scribbling metaphors in their notebooks.
Her presence is simply a reminder that important spaces are incomplete without young people. Her performance is a gentle nudge towards the increasing inclusion of young poets, young activists, and young changemakers in places of power. Gorman’s inaugural poem, in the end, is proof of what happens when young talent is invested in and young voices are heard. When young poets are taken seriously, they shake the world, starting at the swearing-in of the 46th President of the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beyond the big hair, bold colors, and dance pop, 1984 is now also known as the year of Wonder Woman’s next big adventure. The first major Warner Bros. release to come out both in theaters and on HBO Max, “Wonder Woman 1984” follows DC’s beloved Diana Prince sixty years after the events of “Wonder Woman.” Diana, now a permanent resident of the human world, encounters a mysterious wish-granting stone with a terrible price for those who use it. When the artifact goes missing, Wonder Woman must battle a corrupt businessman with dangerous powers and a coworker turned evil in order to save the world from impending doom.
“Wonder Woman 1984” suffers from major pacing issues. The major reveals and stakes of the story fall flat, and certain scenes seem forced and unnecessary. This awkwardness shines through especially in moments where the risk or conflict seems completely avoidable, or when the solution to a character’s problem seems to come out of nowhere. Notably, while chasing down the bad guy, Diana is able to turn an entire plane invisible despite a massive lack of practice. Successes of convenience are not nearly as impactful for audiences when compared to the well-earned successes of Diana’s past.
“Wonder Woman 1984” assumes that the audience already deeply cares about Wonder Woman and her world. This is not a baseless assumption, but this makes it all the more disappointing when the movie does next to nothing with its character arcs. In this film, the big lesson Diana has to learn is how to truly let go of Steve, her love interest from the first movie who is brought back to life by the aforementioned magical stone. The formerly selfless Diana is willing to risk watching the world burn if it means she won’t lose her lover again. The payoff does nothing for viewers when the sacrifice she makes to earn that growth is the same as the first movie: Letting Steve die so that she can save the world. And while it is delightful to see Chris Pine in a fanny pack getting excited that humans went to the moon, he ends up being a manic pixie dream girl. He’s strictly there to move along Diana’s character arc and lacks any of the substance he has in the first movie. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are incredible actors to play these characters, as shown by the first film, but they don’t have a whole lot to work with this time around.
The one standout character was Barbara Minerva, also known as eventual super villain Cheetah. Despite her fall from grace, hers is the only fleshed out arc in the film. While Barbara’s story does fall into some uncomfortable tropes of external appearance tied to internal worth and external admiration, Kristen Wiig gives a good portrayal of a socially awkward and relatively powerless woman whose admiration of the strong and charismatic Diana twists into deep envy and hatred.
One of the main reasons why this movie is so disappointing is its generally high production quality. The aesthetics of the film are wonderfully crafted, from the elaborate and imaginative Amazon Olympics opening sequence to the vibrant and colorful slices of life in the ‘80s. Additionally, Hanz Zimmer delivers an absolutely epic soundscape to underscore Diana’s adventures. However, no amount of visually impressive fight scenes with adrenaline-inducing orchestration can distract from a lackluster story.
Overall, the movie does have a powerful message about moving on from what could have been; it also encourages spending time working for the world you want instead of simply wishing for it to be different. Sadly, these messages are buried under an ultimately subpar script. Maybe the slapstick humor and shallow dialogue of this movie were intended to be nods to the nostalgic campiness associated with ‘80s movies. Unfortunately for “Wonder Woman 1984,” the schtick doesn’t stick, and the film falls tragically short of its trailblazing predecessor.

Nine neatly arranged album covers (they’re not real vinyls, just paper print-outs) of iconic albums, including Radiohead’s “Hail to the Thief,” Tame Impala’s “Currents,” and Caribou’s “Our Love,” adorn the wall of Ethan J. Fields ’22’s bedroom. Track lights bathe a poster of his favorite movie “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” in a dim violet glow. The closet door tilts, broken, at an awkward angle — he hasn’t gotten that fixed yet. This narrow ten by ten bedroom  is, as Fields puts it, “the lab.”
At first glance, Fields resembles the quintessential American adolescent — he rides his bike around the Florida suburbs to escape the monotony of Zoom classes and occasionally contemplates throwing Oreos into his mom’s new air fryer. He also has received DMs from singer-songwriter Charlie Puth, is coordinating a video project with singer and record producer Mike Posner, and flew out to California in December to exchange gifts with R&B icon Alicia Keys as part of a brand advertisement. The Harvard junior boasts nearly 400,000 followers and 9.5 million likes on the digital platform TikTok.
Over the past months, Fields has risen to prominence on TikTok through iconic music mashups. One of his most famous is an alternative cover of Mike Posner’s 2010 hit “Cooler Than Me” in the grunge style of Nirvana, which he later developed into a full-length song. The soundbite has since been used in hundreds of videos across the platform — including mega-influencer Addison Rae’s TikTok thanking fans for 50 million subscribers. Fields’ videos are aesthetically distinct, marked by saturated undertones of violets, blues, and pinks accompanied by bold, retro font.
While today’s influencer culture is mired in controversy — think derivative dating drama, obligatory shade posts, and Facetuned apology videos — Fields recognizes the superficialities of the landscape he inhabits, and rather than succumb to it, he subverts it.
In his recent TikTok video series titled “Making It Cool: The Making of Cooler Than Me by Ethan Fields,” Fields takes a parodic approach to the typical promotional video. Instead of describing himself as an influencer or even a musician, the banner under his name simply reads, “Gemini” and, on another occasion, “Read Nietzsche Once.”
Fields is currently in the process of expanding the series to involve musical stars such as Mike Posner and bassist Blu DeTiger.
“Instead of putting a generic title — like a musician or whatever — I’m thinking, with each influencer that we cast, to kind of flip the script and put something that you wouldn’t expect,” Fields said.
As an example, he cites Mike Posner — the artist behind the original track “Cooler Than Me” — who famously trekked across America from Asbury Park, N.J. to Venice Park, C.A. after his father died of cancer. “Obviously, that’s slightly different than his main claim to fame. So things like that, just to have fun with it and put in little Easter eggs here and there,” Fields said.
Fields’ scrutiny of superficial media, however, extends beyond influencer culture. In a world supersaturated with songs that have catchy beats but whose lyrical value falls flat, Fields strives to achieve a golden ratio. “Oftentimes, people will get to this two-minute thirty-second loop that doesn’t really have a bridge, but the beat in pocket sounds nice. And it’s very listenable,” he said. “I think people are just trying to make stuff that’s listenable without getting to that deeper level of, like, ‘What’s a hook that’s really going to last beyond the initial playlist curation?’”
When creating music, Fields leans into ordinary moments of inspiration. “Choosing the song and figuring out where the relationships are, I think is a little more interesting. And that’s something that comes a little more fleetingly,” he said.
His first music mashup video was Wii Sports’ main menu music in the style of The 1975, a soundbite that has since received over 144,000 views on TikTok. “That just came from playing the game and hearing the synthesizers and thinking, ‘Wow, sonically, it's doing a lot of things that are similar to this most recent 1975 record. So let’s give it a shot and interpolate that over some of the beats that they would use,’” he said.
Fields’ foray into musical experimentation has evolved into a collaborative process. “You’re constantly trying to respond to what fans like,” Fields said. “You’re the same age as your fans. It’s this really weird thing about TikTok, is that your audience is so curated that they’re going to be like you. So I find myself always getting joy from remaking those sounds.”
Specifically, Fields has found success in creating alternative sounds that harken back to a nostalgic time for teenagers and young adults. “There’s this golden spot from 2007 to 2013 when kids our age really started to become cognizant of popular music — I think we all yearn for that era. Songs that are symbolic of that like ‘Tongue-Tied,’ ‘Sweater Weather’ — alternative songs that just cross the threshold from bubblegum pop into the slightly more alt territory,” he said. “It’s a very specific type of song that works. When you do those songs as the niche bands, people really respond to that.”
Beyond TikTok, Fields has pressed pause on his path as a Government concentrator at the College to explore the possibility of pursuing music professionally. He enrolled last fall in the Berklee College of Music’s dual degree program, taking vocal lessons, lyric-writing classes, and expanding his exposure to classical music over Zoom.
Fields’ parents have always supported his musical pursuits. “Just because I played so much, and it was like they could tell I loved it,” Fields said.
He notes, however, that he still had to provide his parents with a “pitch” of sorts to demonstrate “where it could go.”
In December of 2020, for example, Fields posted a TikTok video of a gift exchange with Alicia Keys, which featured apparel by the brand Chinatown Market. “For me, the Alicia Keys video was sort of that watershed moment of, ‘Oh, they want to fly you out to do this advertising,’” Fields said. “And she’s one of those artists that bridges the generations so well — so now they’re really on board with whatever.”
Despite his steep rise to internet stardom, Fields is quick to make light of his situation, combining humor with a signature hint of self-deprecation.
“I think I have the mentality of a quirky side character, but I’ve been kind of thrust into a main character role. And I’m sort of figuring out how it works. Kind of like Obama — just kidding. That was so dumb,” he laughed. “That was so dumb.”

The Season Five premiere of “Riverdale” asks the eternal question: Is it so bad it’s good, or is it just bad? The CW’s hottest (and, admittedly, most fun) mess is back for another season that might finally confirm whether “Riverdale” is more the former or the latter. Over the past four years, the show has evolved from a delightfully campy high school drama that delivered a stylish and satisfying murder mystery in Season One to a hodgepodge of what-am-I-watching moments whose unpredictable plots and comically awkward dialogue have risen to internet infamy and continued to dominate television discourse online. For now, however, it seems that the cults, demonic board games, covert organ farms, and musical episodes are (sort of) in the rearview mirror as Archie Andrews (KJ Apa), Betty Cooper (Lili Reinhart), Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse), Veronica Lodge (Camila Mendes) and friends finally wrap up their last year at Riverdale High.
But if the Season five premiere doesn’t really feel like a season premiere, that’s because it isn’t. Like many television shows, “Riverdale” abruptly shut down production in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. As such, the first three episodes of Season Five pick up exactly where Season Four left off, providing a conclusion and postscript to Season Four’s unfinished arc before moving onto new material — definitely a plus for a show with notably murky season-to-season continuity and a tendency to abandon burgeoning storylines mere episodes after their introductions.
Last season, writers set out to reground the show in the high school drama supposedly at its story’s core, but in truth seemed far more concerned with the numerous businesses and establishments its 17-year-old protagonists now own (at least Barnard seemed impressed that Veronica runs a nightclub?). The opening of Season Five, however, more or less follows through on the writers’ original promise, allowing Archie and Co. to do at least a few normal high school things before graduation: namely, go to the prom, which no one with the exception of Cheryl Blossom (Madelaine Petsch) seems to care very much about — understandably so, since, as always, the show’s protagonists have much bigger (and weirder) fish to fry.
And it seems that Betty and Archie’s fake dating exploits from last season have lasting repercussions for each of their relationships, as we learn that the perpetually indecisive Archie still harbors feelings for Betty. He eventually divulges this fact to Veronica, but not before she discovers and performs a song Archie actually wrote for Betty. Ironically enough, the rekindling of a love triangle that epitomizes cliche just might be the one thread of this story that stirs the pot in a semi-satisfying manner going forward — because somehow the same show that gave us the Gargoyle King and a season arc about a drug called Jingle Jangle writes pretty bland relationships. It’s certainly high time that “Riverdale” shook up its two stagnant main pairings, which have grown stale and, in Betty and Jughead’s case, borderline incestuous (they share a biological half-brother, because of course they do).
But for an episode entitled “Climax,” this season’s premiere is surprisingly tame, arguably anticlimactic. There are a few moments key to the show’s latest convoluted mystery — for example, when prom is interrupted by another violent broadcast from the Auteur, an anonymous individual who has been distributing voyeuristic videotapes of Riverdale homes being watched— but the “Riverdale” writers’ poor track record in matters of continuity pretty much ensures that stakes never feel high and villains always feel disposable.
As the internet knows, “Riverdale” just isn’t the glossy thriller it purports to be. But perhaps unfortunately, Season Five’s debut doesn’t lean quite as hard into the hilarious nonsensicality of its previous seasons, either. In reality, the episode accomplishes little beyond delivering a largely unexciting prom sequence brightened only by the show’s consistently strong costume and set team and the vaguely interesting choice to break up a few of its couples.
However, finding new ways to work within the show’s already outlandish world might just create new possibilities for growth in the upcoming season, which promises somewhat of a departure from its wayward narrative trajectory in at least a few ways. Creator and executive producer Roberto Aguierre-Sacasa confirmed that Season Five would see a seven-year time jump: launching “Riverdale” several years into the future seems a promising solution to both the cast’s unbelievability as high schoolers and the plot’s tendency to stray wildly from typical teen drama genre territory (when’s the last time any of these characters actually went to class?). Hopefully these coming changes will also bring radical amendments to the show’s underutilization and serially shoddy treatment of its queer and nonwhite chracters, especially following actress Vanessa Morgan’s now-viral critique of the writers room’s handling of the show’s Black characters.
Indeed, “Riverdale” Season Five presents its creative team with an opportunity to rein their show in — or to let it go completely. Either way, let’s hope Twitter can milk some good memes from it.

“Bling Empire” premiered at the perfect time — right at the end of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians’” seventeen-year reality TV reign. Just when audiences were beginning to wonder where they’d turn to get their fix of rich people problems after 15 seasons of the Kardashian Klan, “Bling Empire” dropped and became an immediate sensation, putting “KUWTK” and its predecessors to shame.
Set in sunny Los Angeles, “Bling Empire” is shot like a typical reality television program, with events from the cast members’ daily lives interspersed with interview footage. “Bling Empire” is much more visually gripping than your average reality show, however. The footage is beautiful, with lavish shots of sunsets and palm trees, and sets like the cast members’ pristine mansions are easy on the eyes, to say the least. The cast members dress up in outfits that reflect their personalities for their interviews and sit in what looks like someone’s well-decorated living room, making the shots feel more intimate, as if they’ve come out of a documentary. This, coupled with the lavish beauty the cast members surround themselves with in their daily lives — glittering diamond-encrusted necklaces, sparklingly clear pools, beautiful views from a private jet — makes watching “Bling Empire” an aesthetically immersive experience.
Out of all the main cast members, Kevin Kreider is the only non milli-or-billionaire. He views the world of “Bling Empire” like most members of its audience do — with incredulity. He is shocked to learn the price of a pair of Dior sneakers, and even more shocked when he learns a friend’s place costs $19,000 a month (when Kevin tells his friends he pays $1,100 a month in rent, influencer Jaime Xie disbelievingly replies, “That’s not even a pair of shoes!”).
The loveable multi-millionaire Kane Lim is the omniscient narrator of sorts in the show, his interviews revealing the backstories and gossip on all of the cast. He loves shopping and boasts a wall-to-wall collection of impressive shoes, and despite his immense wealth (his family owns a number of shopping malls in Asia), he is one of the most down-to-earth members of “Bling Empire.” A practitioner of Buddhism, he acts as the peacemaker of the group and goes out of his way to support his friends.
Despite what the covetous Christine Chiu thinks, the indisputable queen of the friend group and of “Bling Empire” itself is Anna Shay, billionaire weapons heiress who, according to cast member Kelly Mi Li, travels to Paris more times in a year than she travels to Silver Lake. At 60 years old, Anna is the oldest and wisest of the clan, always ready to dole out sage advice, all the while bedecked in exclusive high jewelry.
Speaking of jewelry, two of the main conflicts of the show’s first season revolve around Louis Vuitton necklaces and... a penis pump. In one episode, Christine Chiu, name-dropping co-owner of Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, Inc. decides to wear an exclusive Louis Vuitton necklace to Anna’s party, knowing that Anna owns a similar one. As a result of Christine’s slight, Anna relegates Christine’s place-setting to the end of the table at dinner, setting off a season-long chain of battles in an escalating social war. The penis pump incident occurs when Kim Lee, famous DJ, discovers said pump while snooping around Anna’s bathroom and throws it out the window in the middle of a backyard spa day. Anna is understandably unamused.
For all of the ways in which it is vastly out-of-touch, the show is oddly compelling.
After finishing Season One, I found myself starting the series over again almost immediately. Despite the grandiosity of it all, “Bling Empire” feels profoundly real. It isn’t all sex toys and sapphires — we watch Kim go on a search for her biological father, while Kevin, who was adopted from Korea, undertakes a similar mission. We learn about the pressure placed on Christine to produce a male heir for her husband’s dynastic family (Gabriel Chiu is the 24th generation direct descendant of the Chinese Song dynasty) and the medical difficulties that ensue. We watch couples fight, make up, and go to therapy sessions. Even though the cast members live oceans away from their home countries, the cast members remain fiercely and proudly connected to their heritages in a way that hasn’t always been represented in reality television. They throw Chinese New Year, Moon Festival, and Singapore Day parties, and regularly spend time learning from each others’ parents.
Maybe the realness of “Bling Empire” comes from the confidence with which the cast members wear their wealth. Unlike the nouveau riche Kardashians, whose status is wholly dependent on their fans for so many years, the members of “Bling Empire” (barring Kim Lee) are not famous, nor beholden to Instagram likes and the whims of fans. They have grown up in this life, and they wear it with ease. Or maybe the success of “Bling Empire” can be chalked up to the desire for escapism in a time of endless uncertainty — right now, who wouldn’t want to be able to take a private jet to Paris just to go to dinner?

In the immortal words of "Mean Girls"' Karen Smith, “Why are you white?” Whitewashing, unlikeable characters and the uninspired inclusion of every teen trope under the moon make Netflix’s new “Fate: The Winx Saga” an insult to the cartoon so many grew up on.
Even before airing, the show faced heavy criticism for its unnecessary changes to the source material. The 2004 “Winx Club” cartoon followed protagonist Bloom and her five friends Stella, Flora, Musa, Tecna, and Aisha (known in some dubs as Layla) as they studied at Alfea College for Fairies and fought threats against the world of Magix. In the cartoon, Musa and Flora are coded as East Asian and Hispanic/Latina, respectively, yet Netflix cast two white women to play them in the live action adaptation Although, in Flora’s case, the [show claims she isn’t whitewashed, there’s simply a new character named Terra (Eliot Salt) — who just so happens to have the same powers and personality as Flora. Ostensibly, her inclusion is to incorporate better body diversity — an important and worthwhile change as this is a prominent failing of the cartoon — but someone really should tell Netflix that plus size Latina women exist. While Precious Mustapha was a great casting choice for Aisha, the erasure of the other women of color tokenizes her character, and Mustapha isn’t given enough to work with as Aisha is the only Winx girl who does not get a proper subplot. Netflix can say what they like about valuing diversity, but it’s clear where they put their time and money — in this case, into a bland project that goes out of its way to be less inclusive and compelling than the source material was.
In addition to these terrible changes, “Fate” either doesn’t know or doesn’t care what friendship is. The cartoon was strong because the fabric of the show was the members of the Winx Club: their personal challenges, teamwork and support for one another. In “Fate,” they occasionally stand for a line-up sho, as if that’s equivalent to meaningful female friendships. When they talk about their problems, they talk at each other — the other girl in the conversation could be replaced with a brick wall and nothing would change. They argue without resolution and almost invariably rebuff the few overtures of friendship we see.
This is most clear during episode four, when all of the main girls minus Stella (Hannah van der Westhuysen) go out of their way to try to eat lunch with Bloom (Abigail Cowen) while the rest of the school is ostracizing her — finally, a chance for some positive interaction! However, Bloom responds by getting up and leaving.
Beyond their (lack of) friendships, all five of the main girls are difficult to root for even as individuals. Bloom is selfish and actively dislikes other human beings (or wingless fairies, apparently), Terra irritates everyone with her inability to read a room, Stella oscillates between being cruel and pathetically needy, Aisha is overbearing and judgemental, and Musa (Elisha Applebaum) flat out doesn’t want to be there. Their supposed character arcs are disjointed and slapdash, and there is not one genuine redeeming quality in sight.
The same lack of focus and poor execution persists with the show’s conflicts. The members of the Winx Club get annoyed at each other for cheap attempts at comedy, but these disagreements are never addressed again or resolved. All but one of their romantic interests are flaky and toxic, which is certainly not helped by the inclusion of a contrived love triangle. In the same vein, the highest stakes conflicts are boring. In “Winx Club,” the initial primary antagonists were the Trix, a trio of evil witches who were a foil to the Winx Club’s friendships and out for blood. They were dynamic and dramatic, and they even sometimes won.
In the show, we have… fire zombies.
The Burned Ones are purportedly impossible to kill — so of course Bloom manages it on her first try. They’re as effective as the screenwriter says they are and devastatingly dull. The analogue for the Trix in “Fate” is one girl — oh-so-cleverly named Beatrix (Sadie Soverall) — who is actually one of the show’s stronger elements. She’s a great example of grey morality in a character, as she does bad things that could possibly be justified. Unfortunately, she’s the only show-invented character to be interesting in this way — much of the narrative energy is expended on new Specialists and teachers, and the core of the show suffers for it. Bloom stumbles along on her quest for answers by herself, while none of the main characters care about the main plot and the threat that the Burned Ones and those who sent them pose to Alfea. And since the main characters don’t care, the viewers certainly can’t be expected to either.
Moreover, “Fate” won’t go two scenes without reminding the viewer just which demographic they’re rebooting “Winx Club” for. Despite none of the characters actually being from Earth, they make sure you know just how hip they are by name-dropping everything from Harry Potter to James Bond to Huda Beauty. And, remember, they’re teens, so random f-bombs and crude sex references are a must.
Similarly, the teen angst has been pushed to the extreme. It’s not enough that, in the cartoon, Bloom was adopted after being the sole survivor of a genocide of her home planet: “Fate” had to invent extra trauma for her. If any parent is mentioned, they’re abusive, dead, or simply untrustworthy, and the teachers are all equally unreliable. The teens have to “solve” their problems by themselves, always with a phone in their hand — because of course they are always carrying phones. Despite these many gestures towards a TV-MA rating, no one really looks like a teenager. Most of the actors are obviously too old for their character’s age, and no one is dressed like a teenager — their fashion is equal parts ridiculous and disappointing when the source material was so fashion-forward. Similarly, despite the show’s attempts at mature, gritty themes, the main characters have the same ages as their cartoon counterparts: They’re all sixteen. Just like with “Riverdale” and the “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,” Netflix can’t resist continuing to sexualize minors in “Fate.”
Despite the many, many complaints lodged, “Fate: The Winx Saga” could have been adequate — if it was an independent property. As a story about a group of teenagers in another dimension navigating learning magic, high school drama and intermittent danger it would be on par with Netflix’s other abominations aimed at teen girls. But as a “Winx Club” live action? It’s a damn shame.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One hundred years ago today on January 29, 1921 at Radcliffe College, Dr. Eva Beatrice Dykes successfully submitted her dissertation “Pope and His Influence in America from 1715-1850” to become the first Black woman to complete the requirements for a Ph.D. in the United States. The morning I first saw Dr. Dykes’ dissertation submission for her Doctor of Philosophy in English Philology degree, Harvard announced the closure of campus due to the rising Covid-19 pandemic. Minutes after receiving the email from University President Lawrence S. Bacow, I rushed to Schlesinger Library archives to spend as much time as I could with Dr. Dykes’ Radcliffe records.
For the next three days, I poured over her files that included everything from her Radcliffe application and an old yearbook to newspaper clippings and Radcliffe alumni surveys. The more I read, the more the intimate details revealed the long and prominent life of Dr. Eva B. Dykes.
After receiving her first bachelor’s degree from Howard University in 1914, Dr. Dykes taught English at Walden University for a year. She then matriculated to Radcliffe college in 1915 and just two years later graduated with a second bachelor’s Magna Cum Laude. A few months later, she began her graduate work in English philology. After making history, she had a long career teaching at Dunbar High School, Howard University, and eventually Oakwood College where she would spend the rest of her career.
One day at Oakwood College, Dr. Dykes noticed that all the other professors had gotten a promotion. She approached the President of Oakwood College, Frank L. Peterson, at the time about why she didn’t receive one. She recalls him stating, “Well, you are a woman. That’s why you didn’t get it.” Dr. Dykes then responded, “President Peterson, if I go over here to the store and want to buy a loaf of bread, do I get a reduction because I am a woman? If I want to go downtown and buy clothes, do I get a reduction because I am a woman?”
The confidence and determination she displayed at every stage of her life spoke to my state of mind at the time. I was a bit lost and uncertain about which Ph.D. program offer I would accept, eager to visit as many universities as possible before the pandemic put my plans to a halt. In her files I saw someone who had very few options for where she could study as a Black woman in the early twentieth century. Yet here I was with an abundance of options. In many ways, I chose to study at Harvard to walk the path Dr. Dykes paved for me.
At Schlesinger Library, I heard Dr. Dykes’ voice for the first time through the Black Women’s Oral History Project and her words only further confirmed my decision. As I listened to her describe her life to Dr. Merze Tate, the first Black woman to graduate from Radcliffe with a Ph.D. in Government and International Relations, I realized the precious burden Black women have to preserve and honor the ones that came before us. As precious of a burden as it may be, if we don’t honor us, who else will?
Harvard professor Danielle Allen followed the legacy of Dr. Tate in many ways as she curated an exhibit called “Integrating the Life of the Mind: African-Americans at the University of Chicago, 1870-1940.” Through the exhibit, she preserved the legacy of another Black woman, Dr. Georgiana Simpson, who due to an earlier commencement date than Dr. Dykes became the first Black woman to receive her Ph.D. degree in the United States. Both women were joined by Dr. Sadie Alexander at the University of Pennsylvania, making it three Black women in total who earned their Ph.D.s in 1921. Without Dr. Allen’s dedication to publicly honoring the accomplishments of Black women, I would have never found her exhibit during my sophomore year in college and discovered my interest in history.
In 2017, I co-founded the Monumental Women Project with my friend, Asya Akca, to make Dr. Allen’s discovery even more public. We commissioned a bronze bust of Dr. Georgiana Simpson, the first public monument to honor a Black woman in the city of Chicago. Through this, I learned that when we relegate Black accomplishments to underground vaults, folders, and corners of our libraries and archives, we miss opportunities to imbue Black life into campus monuments, traditions, and buildings. Just imagine how a public monument to Dr. Dykes, especially here at Harvard, could inspire a new and larger generation of Black women, whose underrepresentation persists in both public monuments and academia.
So today, I honor and introduce to you Dr. Eva B. Dykes. She was an academic, a pioneer, an accomplished pianist, and a woman of faith who gave herself as much to her church as she did to her universities. She never married nor had children, but her legacy remains in every Black person that has the opportunities she made available to us.
Celebrating the centennial of the first Black woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States during my first year in my own Ph.D. program seems bittersweet, as I have been unable to experience Harvard’s campus as a graduate student. However, I am encouraged by Dr. Tate, Dr. Allen, and all the other Black women who came before me that we’ll find a way to honor Dr. Eva B. Dykes’ legacy on campus with the same rigor and devotion she dedicated to her career.

Harvard has formed a steering committee to catalogue and develop policies around the human remains housed in the school’s museums, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in an email to affiliates on Thursday.
The announcement comes following a review by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, which found that the museum holds the human remains of at least 15 individuals of African descent who were likely to have been alive during the time of slavery in the U.S., Bacow wrote.
“This important work is long overdue,” he wrote. “On behalf of the University community, I apologize for Harvard’s role in collection practices that placed the academic enterprise above respect for the dead and human decency.”
The committee will be tasked with creating “a comprehensive survey of human remains” across all Harvard museums and examining their use. It will also develop a policy on the “collection, display, and ethical stewardship” of human remains in all University museums.
“The committee’s initial focus will be archival research on the remains of the fifteen individuals identified in the Peabody review,” Bacow wrote.
The steering committee — which is charged with producing a public report by fall 2021 — will be headed by Evelynn M. Hammonds, a professor of History of Science and African and African American Studies and a former Dean of the College.
“Guided by their findings, the committee will consult within and beyond the Harvard community to consider options for the return of these remains, as well as their burial or reburial, commemoration, and memorialization,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow noted the University also “care[s] for” one the largest collections of American Indian remains in the country, and is working to return culturally affiliated Native American human remains and objects in the Peabody Museum to tribal nations.
Bacow wrote that these existing efforts, as well as the ongoing University-wide initiative researching Harvard’s ties to slavery, will inform the efforts of Hammonds’s committee.
“One measure of any community is how it treats its least powerful members,” Bacow wrote. “We cannot remedy the indignities visited upon some of the individuals whose remains are housed in our museum collections while they lived, but we can help to ensure that they are treated in death with the care that we would wish for ourselves.”
Bacow wrote that the discovery underscored the importance of reckoning with the University’s history with slavery.
“Our museum collections undoubtedly help to expand the frontiers of knowledge, but we cannot—and should not—continue to pursue truth in ignorance of our history,” he wrote.

The first National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda S. C. Gorman ’20 will recite an original poem at the Super Bowl LV pre-show on Feb. 7, following a streak of success that led her to the nation’s Capitol to perform at President Joe Biden's inauguration last week.
Since she performed her inaugural poem, ‘The Hill We Climb,’ Gorman’s three books — “The Hill We Climb: Poems,” “Change Sings: A Children’s Anthem,” and “The Hill We Climb: An Inaugural Poem for the Country” — became the top three bestselling books at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Powell last Friday. Gorman also signed to IMG Models — a modeling agency that represents Bella Hadid, Ashley Graham, and tennis player Naomi Osaka — the company announced Tuesday.
Next Sunday’s poem will pay homage to three honorary Americans selected by the NFL, per a league press release. They include educator Trimaine Davis, nurse manager Suzie Dorner, and Marine Corps veteran James Martin.
Gorman, a former concentrator in Sociology and a Leverett House alumna, became the first U.S. National Youth Poet Laureate in her freshman year at Harvard in 2017. Before then, she served as the Inaugural Youth Poet Laureate of the West.
Sociology professor Jocelyn S. Viterna — who met Gorman during her freshman fall at Harvard — said the poet’s focus on art and passion for social reform “expanded” the way the department thought about its own discipline. Viterna added that Gorman and her classmates ultimately brought about a “complete revision” in the way that the department taught theory.
“She was invested in Harvard and didn’t just pass through and get her degree,” Viterna said. “Harvard is a better place because she was here and because she was thoughtful about the program and her place in the community.”
Viterna said she enjoyed watching Gorman make arguments in class because of the power and purpose that animated her words. The poem performed at Biden's inauguration, Viterna said, embodied Gorman’s long-standing desire to inspire change.
“I appreciated how she was able to capture the reality of what we’ve gone through,” Viterna said. “She was still able to imagine a force for change in the future and that’s one of the things that feels very emblematic to me about Amanda.”
Laura Gorman Thomas, the sociology department’s undergraduate advising and program administrator, met Gorman during her sophomore year. The poet's “self-assuredness” made a lasting first impression, said Thomas, who is not related to Amanda Gorman.
“There was something about the way that she carried herself,” Thomas recalled. “The first thing she said to me, once we introduced ourselves and she was sitting across me, she said, ‘I will be president in 2036.’”
“And I have no doubt she will be,” Thomas added.
Despite the poet’s achievements and frequent speaking engagements outside of class, Thomas said Gorman remained humble and involved in her studies.
Thomas added that she watched Gorman’s inaugural reading multiple times and was “amazed by her words.”
“I was very excited and proud of her, but I’m not surprised. I know how smart she is,” she said.
NYU professor of sociology Bart Bonikowski, who formerly taught Gorman at Harvard, wrote in an email that the poet’s “intellectual playfulness” and creativity fuel her “very serious goal” of exposing societal flaws and creating hope.
“Amanda is simply remarkable: a brilliant poet, an exceedingly generous and kind person, a tireless activist, and a top-notch researcher,” he wrote. “There is also a certain vulnerability to her creative work and personal disposition that I greatly value.”
Bonikowski recalled that Gorman helped catalyze a difficult class discussion following former President Donald Trump’s election in 2016.
“It was an emotional hour, and I distinctly recall Amanda asking typically astute questions, but also being frank about the sense of foreboding she felt about the political changes to come, which would disproportionately affect communities of color,” he wrote.
Bonikowski added he was “thrilled,” four years later, to see Gorman take the stage on a historic day for the nation.
“That her reading followed the swearing-in of the first woman, first Indian-American, and first Jamaican-American Vice President, and that the day marked the end of a particularly shameful four years of our history, made the moment all the more profound,” Bonikowski wrote. “And yet, Amanda not only rose to the occasion—she stole the show.
Bonikowski said he considers himself “lucky” to have known Gorman and witnessed the rise of her career, but noted that she is “just getting started.”
“I have no doubt whatsoever that we will all continue being impressed by her for many years to come—and that the world will be a better place as a result of her brilliant work,” he wrote.

Harvard University Housing announced last week that it will hold rents for the 2021-22 academic year flat in comparison to the cost of rent this academic year across all of HUH’s properties.
In addition to holding rents flat, HUH announced on Jan. 22 that it will continue pandemic relief policies established during the early months of the crisis. These policies include offering more latitude in subletting, flexibility in lease dates, and individual roommate rent charges. Across all units, HUH will extend a pandemic relief adjustment of $150 per month from March 1 through June 30, 2022 across all units.
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that HUH has attempted to address pandemic-related economic hardships through several policies.
“The temporary pandemic relief adjustment is just one way in which Harvard University Housing (HUH) is helping to mitigate the difficulties and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic,” she wrote. “From penalty-free early lease terminations, to sublet rent relief, no-fee transfers, and greater flexibility in the choice of lease start dates, HUH is proud of the ways in which it has tried to help ease the difficulties some residents may be facing.”
Cynthia E. Ahmed, a Harvard Law student who will reside in University housing with roommates during the spring semester, said she was impressed by the flexibility in lease dates offered by HUH.
“Basically, you can start a lease any time from January until the end of February, with totally flexible dates — and you can reserve it but not have to pay for it until you move in,” she said. “And then you can move out or terminate your lease at any point, and not have to pay penalty or be responsible for the rest of the lease.”
Other tenants, however, said they wished HUH was more proactive about supporting residents during the earlier months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Felipe Estrada-Prada, a senior learning technologist at Graduate School of Education’s Teaching and Learning Lab, said rigid rates motivated many residents to move out during the pandemic.
“They were very unflexible at the beginning. And to be honest, I don’t really see right now much more flexibility,” he said. “I think they could have done so much more. I mean, they have empty units, and people were really leaving because they couldn’t pay.”
Juan Pablo Ugarte, a Graduate School of Design student who lives in HUH with his wife and daughters, said HUH’s sublet rent relief option is “extremely useful” — especially for international families that frequently travel like his own. Ugarte and his family returned to Chile during winter break through use of HUH’s sublet option and were able to avoid paying rent during the month they were gone.
“For the winter break, it made sense for us, because, essentially, we were thinking that with Covid cases going up, they were going to close the daycare again,” he said. “It didn’t seem like such a good time to be locked in the house. It was a little depressing, I guess. So we took that option, which is essentially a month without rent.”
Lucero R. Varela, a research assistant at the Ed School’s EASEL Lab, said the relationships she built with fellow HUH residents, particularly through HUH’s Graduate Commons Program, have helped her connect with fellow peers during a time characterized by isolation.
“During the pandemic, I was feeling alone because I have been living alone in my apartment for, like, 10 months,” she said. “This was my first experience living alone. So it was great to have them and to be able to connect with them a few times a week.”

A former Harvard dormitory building that today houses Harvard Square staples like Pokeworks and OTTO Pizza was purchased last month by Gazit Horizons, Inc. for $45 million.
The 50,000 square foot building, which is located at 1430 Mass. Ave., was purchased in an “off-market transaction” from previous owner University Common Real Estate, which owned the property for more than half a century, according to Gazit’s press release. Gazit Horizons is a subsidiary of global real estate company Gazit-Globe.
The sale occurs against the backdrop of a slew of construction projects springing up in Harvard Square, including renovations of the Harvard Cooperative Society’s flagship store and The Abbot Buildings that previously housed the Curious George Store.
Jeff Mooallem, president and CEO of Gazit Horizons, said his company’s business plan is to locate real estate that it deems “difficult” — “if not impossible” — to replace.
“Boston has always been a city that we’ve really, really liked as an investment thesis,” he said. “The politics are such that buying older buildings and fixing them up makes more sense than it might in a city where everything is torn down and built brand new.”
Mooallem said Gazit Horizons plans to knock down the existing low ceilings and double the height of the retail space.
“There's very little we can do on the exterior of the building because it is a historic designation and it does have great character already,” Mooallem said. “But I think you'll see us modernize the office space, both improving the lobby, the elevators, and feel of it.”
Though the pandemic has devastated local businesses and deterred tourism, Mooallem said he believes Harvard Square will bounce back.
“We're long term owners, we're patient owners,” he said. “When the traffic and the tourists and the students and the employees come back, we think we'll be ready with a good asset.”
While CVS and Santander Bank — two of the building's main retail tenants — have leases that are expected to expire in 2021, Gazit Horizons will continue to work with the other businesses occupying the space while also getting “a fresh tenant or two into the mix,” Mooallem said.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, wrote in an email that the previous owners of the building, which was known as College House when it was used as a Harvard dorm, are “treasured community partners.”
“They are supportive of the Square, the HSBA, the city and many social service initiatives in and about the Square. We will miss them,” she wrote. “However, we have met with the new owners and are pleased they intend to be active and supportive partners.”

Political reporters and experts convened over Zoom to discuss the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building, former President Donald Trump’s impeachment, and the inauguration of President Joe Biden at a JFK Jr. Forum panel Thursday.
The event, entitled “What Just Happened? Insurrection, Impeachment, and Inauguration” featured Igor Bobic, a HuffPost senior political reporter; Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager for former President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign and the executive producer of Biden’s virtual inauguration; and Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the blog LawFare. Dan Balz, an IOP senior fellow and a political correspondent for the Washington Post, moderated the event.
Bobic, who was at the Capitol on Jan. 6 to cover Biden’s electoral vote certification, offered insight into what it was like to witness the insurrection up close. He captured a video — which has garnered 10.5 million views on Twitter — of Capitol police officer Eugene Goodman confronting the mob inside of the building and leading rioters away from the Senate floor.
Bobic said that the magnitude of Goodman’s intervention was not clear at the time. Goodman has since been credited with diverting the crowd from interacting with senators who had not yet been evacuated.
“It wasn't clear to any of us what he really did until days later, when we found out that the Senate Chamber itself, with all 100 senators in there and the vice president, wasn't sealed at the time that officer Goodman was only steps away, downstairs,” Bobic said. “If he didn't delay their progress, who knows what would have happened?”
Bobic also said the image of a man carrying a Confederate flag through the Capitol building will be “seared” into his brain.
“To me, the symbolism of this rioter carrying a Confederate flag outside the Senate Chamber itself was the most visceral thing,” Bobic said. “It just made me so outraged standing there.”
The panelists also discussed the aftermath of the Capitol insurrection, specifically Trump's impeachment — his second during his tenure. Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives on Jan. 13, is set to face trial in the Senate in the coming weeks.
Wittes said the marked partisan split regarding Trump’s impeachment suggests that polarization in government hinders the Constitution's efficacy.
“What Trump has done has really shown that the impeachment as a mechanism of accountability doesn't work in the face of genuine partisan polarization,” Wittes said. “And that's something I think the founders did not anticipate. It’s certainly not the way they wrote about impeachment.”
In addition to political polarization and extremism, the U.S. is also suffering from a global pandemic. Taken together, the inauguration was especially difficult to put on, Cutter said.
“We had hundreds of people traveling here to produce the shows, and there was a lot of nervousness about it,” Cutter said. “So that was what we had to work through to make people feel safe to participate in a presidential inauguration, which is startling that you even have to say that.”
A silver lining of the largely virtual setting, Cutter said, was that it made participation in the inaugural events more egalitarian.
“You didn't have to have an inside game to get a ticket to sit on the floor to watch a speech. You didn't have to spend thousands of dollars for a ticket to the inauguration and stand in long lines and high heels and lose your coat. You can sit on your couch and feel just as much a part of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faced with another semester online, a lost year of athletics eligibility, and a dearth of social interaction, some students who took classes in the fall opted to take the spring off.
A Harvard College Open Data Project report published in December predicted that the freshman and sophomore classes would shrink 3 and 5 percent, respectively, in the spring semester compared to the fall. The College has yet to release official spring enrollment data.
Sarah Mrad ’24, who spent her first semester of college at home in Lebanon, said she decided to take a leave following months marked by limited social interaction.
“I really did enjoy my classes, and I did feel like I learned as much as I would in a non-remote setting. However, the classes were the only thing that I could enjoy,” Mrad said.
Federal visa restrictions shut out international freshmen, including Mrad, from living on campus last fall because all College courses were held online. Those same restrictions are still in effect this semester.
Mrad said the time zone difference between Lebanon and Cambridge meant her classes ran as late as 4 a.m. It also prevented her from joining most extracurricular activities.
“Clubs would usually meet evening time, like Boston time, so I was never really able to participate in anything,” Mrad said. “I wasn’t able to make any connections and I wasn’t able to benefit from clubs or anything that Harvard offers besides classes.”
By contrast, Brian J. Zhou ’24, who lived on campus for his first semester, said the fall “exceeded expectations.”
“We thought we were gonna be imprisoned in dorms and stuff but still got to meet up with people and hang out outside and explore Boston, so that was very nice,” he said.
Still, Zhou said he decided to forgo taking classes this spring to intern abroad in Morocco.
“The main reason was probably more to do with having an opportunity to work at a nonprofit about social entrepreneurship in Morocco,” he said. “Once I had that figured out I was like, ‘Alright, this is not that hard of a decision.’”
Sofia A. Castore ’24, meanwhile, said she did not find another semester of online school appealing.
“This was my first time doing classes online, and it really wasn’t the best for me. I couldn’t really pay attention,” she said. “I didn’t really feel like I learned anything.”
“I felt like it was unfair to my parents to have them pay,” she said. “I wasn’t really gonna get the full advantage of my education.”
By taking the spring off, Castore — a member of the women’s field hockey team — will also be eligible for another year of collegiate athletics.
“All the Ivy Leagues have a rule where you can only be enrolled for eight semesters, so in order to use the extra year of eligibility that the NCAA granted fall and winter athletes, you have to take a semester off at some point,” she said. “If I take the spring off, I’m able to play an extra season of a fall sport.”
Preserving athletics eligibility also prompted Dylan Rhee ’24, a member of the men’s swimming and diving team, to take the semester off. Rhee added that seven other freshmen on the men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams are also taking the spring off.
Though Rhee said his experience on campus during the fall semester was positive and provided “some semblance of a social life,” he said Harvard’s decision to offer spring housing to seniors and juniors — not freshmen — helped him make his decision.
Rhee said he is searching for an internship and plans to spend most of the spring training for the upcoming Olympic swimming trials in June.
Though Harvard invited upperclassmen back to campus, some still decided to defer their enrollment.
Stephanie Yao ’22 said her decision to take time off from the College was “difficult” because she would have been prioritized for Harvard housing as an enrolled junior this spring. Still, Yao said she is pleased with her choice.
“I just felt like I was missing the opportunities to be able to meet people on campus and, to me, being at Harvard is ultimately about the people you get to meet,” Yao said. “I didn’t want to give up another semester of not being able to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Disclosure by academics and cooperation from universities are paramount in maintaining a balance between open academic exchange and national security priorities, United States Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a Jan. 20 interview with The Crimson.
Lelling — who serves as U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts — has prosecuted several academics for failing to disclose their research ties to Chinese institutions and the Chinese government. Notably, Charles M. Lieber, the former Harvard Chemistry department chair, was arrested last January on charges of lying to federal authorities about his involvement in a Chinese talent recruitment program. He is being prosecuted by Lelling’s office.
Lelling said the issue of academics at American universities sharing research with foreign governments is not limited to just Chinese actors, nor to the recent decade.
“In the eighties and earlier, there was concern in the United States about the influence of Arab countries on higher education in the United States through OPEC,” he said, referring to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. “Currently it’s the Chinese, and concern about the Chinese government's influence or infiltration of higher education.”
Lelling said the U.S. government is concerned not only with Chinese actors circumventing academic norms, but also with Americans complicit in sharing proprietary information. To that end, Lelling said the Justice Department has made targeted arrests to raise awareness of the issue and the fields in which it takes place.
“It's really across industries and across academic disciplines on the hard sciences side,” Lelling said. “[We] try to deter it by either prosecuting Chinese nationals who've come to the United States for the purpose of stealing technology or prosecuting people in the United States already — U.S. citizens — who are collaborating with the Chinese, which is perfectly legal, but who hide those affiliations. You see both flavors.”
In November 2018, the Justice Department established the China Initiative, which works on “identifying and prosecuting those engaged in trade secret theft, hacking, and economic espionage,” among other goals, according to the department's website. Lelling currently serves on the initiative’s Steering Committee, alongside the Assistant Attorney General for National Security and other U.S. attorneys.
“A lot of what we focused on was outreach: we didn’t want to just show up and start prosecuting people,” said Lelling, who will likely be replaced by a nominee of President Joe Biden in the near future. “The point of the effort was to sensitize the public that there is this massive effort by the Chinese government to steal technology from the United States and bring it to China.”
Lelling said the initiative also aimed to sensitize universities so leadership would reiterate the importance of proper disclosure to faculty.
“That collaboration is totally legal, but the government’s got a right to know if it’s happening so that public policy decisions can be made about whether you want this much collaboration,” Lelling said.
Lelling acknowledged the China Initiative’s efforts have “unavoidably” placed additional scrutiny on individuals of Chinese descent in America.
“What you don’t want is a general rising level of hostility to people who happen to be of Chinese ethnicity — very difficult balancing act,” Lelling said. “Whenever we talk about these cases, we are careful to say, it’s not about ethnicity. It’s about conduct.”
“[The Lieber case] helped us make this point that we’re not just chasing down Chinese nationals, people of Chinese ethnicity in the United States,” Lelling added.
Lelling lauded Harvard’s efforts to curb unfair academic practices, noting that Harvard has successfully balanced the interests of its faculty with its obligations to the government.
“On the one hand, the Harvard administration has been forthcoming with information to the government and has given us some cooperation,” Lelling said. “On the other hand, the [Harvard] administration has been pretty good — at least from what I hear — about dealing with its own faculty on this issue.”
Last October, Lieber sued Harvard, alleging the University broke its contract by refusing to indemnify him for his criminal defense. Lieber also alleged it was illegal for Harvard to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney’s Office by furnishing them with documents and witnesses.
Lelling’s office noted in a Wednesday court filing pertaining to the Lieber case that Harvard had “substantially completed its production of documents to the government.”
Lieber’s attorney, Marc L. Mukasey, wrote in an emailed statement Friday that the allegations against his client are “bogus.”
“Professor Lieber’s contributions to science were ruined by the government’s sensational, headline-grabbing - yet totally unsupported - claims about espionage and national security,” Mukasey wrote. “If an amicable and peaceful dialogue about harmless - and indeed beneficial - academic collaboration with China had been undertaken, the DOJ could have accomplished [its] goals without destroying the Professor’s life.”
On Jan. 14, Lelling announced the arrest of MIT mechanical engineering professor Gang Chen in the latest development in the China Initiative. In stark contrast to Harvard’s cooperation with the government in the Lieber case, M.I.T. has challenged Lelling’s allegations and has paid for Professor Chen’s legal defense funds, according to the New York Times.
Lelling said developing rigorous reporting guidelines can help allow for robust academic cooperation without endangering national security interests.
“Collaboration with foreign researchers is like the lifeblood of the scientific community — no one is saying don’t do it,” Lelling said. “Equally importantly, don’t lie about it, don’t hide it. Catalog it, be forthcoming about it on the appropriate forms.”
Lelling advised his successor to continue to build relationships and trust with academic institutions and the public.
“You have to reach out to the high-tech sector, the life sciences sector, and the academic institutions in this area in order to maintain trust in what the federal government is doing,” he said. “My view as a federal prosecutor has always been: do the cases you need to do, but you need to be as transparent as you can be because the public has a right to understand why you’re doing it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are not many long snappers in the National Football League. Each team usually allocates just one roster spot for a long snapper (only seven of the 32 teams currently have two long snappers under contract). The limited number of spots makes the position a not-so-easy job to land, but to Tyler Ott ‘14, former Harvard football tight end and current pro long snapper, it is one of the best jobs in the NFL.
“It’s a pretty great job in the NFL. You know, you might have some pressure situations, but as far as contact and staying healthy—knock on wood and everything—it’s one of the best positions I think that you could be playing,” Ott said.
In an NFL season that came with many firsts—teams played in empty stadiums, teams were restricted to entirely virtual practice some weeks, and the Super Bowl will be hosted by one of the teams playing for the title—some of the most exciting firsts revolve around Harvard football.
This NFL season marks the first time that two Harvard football alumni have been selected to the Pro Bowl (the NFL’s all-star contest) in the same year. Harvard tight end and pro fullback Kyle Juszczyk ‘13 of the San Francisco 49ers and Ott of the Seattle Seahawks—former teammates—earned selections to “play” virtually in the Pro Bowl this Sunday, January 31. The festivities include a week’s worth of digital events, concluding in a “Madden NFL 21” game featuring video-game versions of the players selected to the all-star event, like Ott and Juszczyk. The game’s normal in-person version, however, is canceled this year, unlike the regular season or Super Bowl. This is Juszyzyk’s fifth selection to the Pro Bowl, and Ott’s first.
Pro Bowl selections are voted on by fans, players, and coaches, with each groups’ ballots counting for a third of the vote. Nonetheless, this is only the second year in which long snappers have been included on the ballot. Before the 2019-2020 season, the coaching staffs of the two Pro Bowl teams hand-picked the long snappers themselves.
“Obviously very proud and excited and humbled to be selected… It’s humbling to know my peers see the work I’ve been doing and the season I’ve been having,” said Ott, who joins the list as just the fourth Crimson alum to be selected to a Pro Bowl.
The others are Pat McInally ‘75, who made the Pro Bowl in 1982 as a punter with the Cincinnati Bengals, Matt Birk ‘98, who made the Pro Bowl six times in the 2000s as a center with the Minnesota Vikings, and of course, most recently, Kyle Juszczyk ‘13, who has made the Pro Bowl the last five seasons, once with the Baltimore Ravens and subsequently with the San Francisco 49ers.
Ott’s path to the Pro Bowl, before running through Harvard, began when he first picked up long snapping in middle school—and may have never occurred if a soccer player had not taken his spot.
“I was a kicker for a hot second, back, like fifth, sixth grade,” Ott recalled. “Seventh grade...we had a soccer player decide to join the team and take over kicking, so to stay a part of that, I messed around with snapping a little bit.”
Ott credits his former coach Carl Johnson for helping him hone the skill, beginning in his freshman year on junior varsity at Jenks High School in Oklahoma. Johnson, who used to coach long snappers and special teams at the college level, asked Ott to snap one day during practice and coached Ott along the way as he stuck with it. “He pretty much gave me the foundation of my snapping,” says Ott. Since then, “It’s all been kind of self-taught and self-adjust as needed, working on different stuff.”
When he arrived at Harvard as a first-year after being recruited as a tight end, the Crimson coaching staff had no idea Ott would end up doubling as a long snapper.
“They didn’t really know I could snap until I raised my hand one day at practice, or before practice, and was like ‘Hey do you guys want me to go snap or anything?’ and they’re like, ‘Uh, sure, we didn’t know you could,’” said Ott.
Needless to say, he took over primary long snapping duties beginning in 2011, his sophomore season, while continuing to play tight end. In 2014, Ott finished the year with 15 receptions for 188 yards and four touchdowns, including three against Princeton in a triple-overtime heartbreaker. While considering trying to play tight end professionally, Ott ultimately decided to give long snapping a shot at the NFL level after graduating with a degree in economics and a secondary in environmental science and public policy.
“I thought there was a slim chance I could maybe play tight end, but you know snapping was really my ticket,” he said.
Ott began his NFL career with brief stints with the New England Patriots, New York Giants, St. Louis Rams (now the Los Angeles Rams), and Cincinnati Bengals throughout his first two NFL seasons. A January 1, 2017, phone call, however, would change his career. Due to an injury to the Seattle long snapper right before the squad's wild card playoff game, the team needed a replacement in a hurry. The Seahawks would turn to Ott, signing him in time for their win over the Detroit Lions on January 7. Ott has remained with the team ever since, signing a three-year contract extension in 2019, contracting him through the 2022-2023 season.
Despite Ott’s success this year, the season did not come without its challenges and difficult choices. On his decision to opt into this COVID-affected season, Ott, who is involved in the NFL Players Association, the union that represents the league’s players, said, “We felt safe with the protocols that the NFL was putting in place… So we felt pretty safe that, if there was going to be a season, that I should keep working… You know, every year lost in the NFL is big because you don't have a long career.”
Tyler and his wife Ashley Ott ‘11, former Crimson women’s ice hockey forward, have a five-month-old son, and Ott said one of the toughest parts of this year has been not being able to see family, especially for them to meet the baby. Despite these challenges, Ott said he is very fortunate to be in the position he is, being able to play football and being on a team that did exceptionally well with staying safe. The Seahawks finished their season without a single COVID-19 case on the roster and avoided practice and walk-through cancellations entirely.
Looking towards the virtual Pro Bowl this Sunday, former Crimson teammates Ott and Juszczyk—who now faceoff at least twice a season as divisional rivals—will be (in theory) suiting up to play together on the same team once again, although on the screen and not quite on the field.
Reflecting on his time at Harvard, Ott remarked, “I was in a [tight end] group with some really good players… We had a really stacked room… [The] tight end room was always a really good room for some reason at Harvard.”
All these years later, Juszczyk, Cameron Brate ‘14 (who will be appearing in Super Bowl LV next week), and Anthony Firkser ‘17 are all among those who played tight end with Ott for Harvard and are currently competing in the NFL. Centers Nick Easton ‘15, Cole Toner ‘16, and Adam Redmond ‘17 also all overlapped at least one year with Ott in college and are on active rosters or practice squads in the NFL. While never overlapping with Ott, quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05 just completed his 16th season in the NFL as well. Ben Braunecker ‘16—another member of that tight end room—also recently spent four years with the Chicago Bears before retiring following his release last offseason.
Ott says that people often ask him how many Harvard football alumni are in the NFL. “We always remind guys that there's like eight or nine of us that are in the league right now on roster[s] or on practice squad[s] and everybody's like, ‘No way, you're kidding.’”
“We [Harvard alumni] get to jersey swap and do all that fun stuff...trying to get the Crimson collection of jerseys together… We show some proof on the field that we have some good football back in the Ivy League.”

A lot of things developed over early quarantine: my crippling TikTok addiction, whipped coffee, and my pets and I became really close. Like, really close — to the point of separation anxiety. And while we may not be able to be with them, try a few of these ideas to help cope with missing them!
“Adopt” a dog on campus 
There are so many cute dogs on campus from tourists, proctors, and families, all of which could be “yours.” While we cannot condone stealing someone’s pet, “adopt” one — go visit your local proctor and offer to take their dog on walks or pet-sit! While respecting social distancing and with permission, you could also pet some local dogs and make a new friend. Pro tip: as a Quadling, I can tell you the Quad has an abnormally large amount of cute dogs. And if campus dogs aren’t enough, go check out one of Cambridge’s multiple dog parks!
(Secretly) foster kittens
In times like these, we must all adjust to new ways of life. With no guests allowed in rooms, we have been presented with an immense challenge this semester, but also a wonderful possibility: fostering kittens. These little balls of fluff would provide immeasurable joy and it would be as beneficial to you as it would for them! For ~legal reasons~ we? do not condone fostering kittens… But realistically, how would anyone know? Food for thought...
Facetime your pets!
Call your family under the pretense of talking to them and demand to speak with your pet! While you can’t see their cute faces in person currently, their nose pressed up against the camera is a serotonin boost and a great photo-op. From personal experience, results can vary, as my dog gets very excited and my cat feigns disinterest and acts as if she has no idea who I am. However, it is still highly recommended.
Adopt a rock/plant
Need a companion but just don’t have the time to take care of it? Why not adopt a rock! You can paint it, talk to it, and keep it on your desk to study with you. Hey, desperate times call for desperate measures. Or buy a plant! Very similar to the rock, but with slight responsibilities. Just water as required and bam!
Befriend the squirrels
Campus has a lot of squirrels. Yes, they are pretty thicc and alarmingly aggressive, but also could be a good pal. All you need to do is channel your inner Snow White, don’t flinch when they run at you maliciously, and win over their hearts. Disclaimer: this has not yet been done successfully, so befriend the squirrels at your own risk. High risk, high reward type of scenario.
Although all of these are guaranteed to bring you immense joy, we know none of them can really replace seeing your pet now that you’re away from home. Hang in there! Soon you will be together again!
