After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 9, 2013, at 4:04 p.m.
Joanna Y. Li '12, a Kirkland House resident and neurobiology concentrator who had been on leave from the College since last spring semester, died Tuesday in Somerville, Kirkland House administrators announced in an email to the House community Wednesday night.
Kirkland will hold a gathering in the Senior Common Room at 5 p.m. on Thursday to remember Li.
In their email, Kirkland House Masters Tom C. and Verena A. Conley and resident dean Cory T. Way urged any community members in need of counseling services to reach out to them, House tutors, or University Health Services.
“The news is disquieting for everyone at Kirkland, especially for the students, faculty, and staff throughout the College who have known her,” they wrote. “We mourn her passing.”
In an email to the Harvard community Thursday morning, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds described Li as “a beloved member” of the Kirkland House community whose loss “will be felt deeply” at Harvard.
Hammonds wrote that Li had been on leave from the College since February 2012. She wrote that medical examiners have not yet determined the cause of Li’s death, but that they do not believe foul play was involved.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

An envelope sent to Harvard Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz that was opened Thursday afternoon contained a suspicious white powder, prompting the evacuation of Hauser Hall’s fifth floor. An on-scene test and a laboratory test later in the evening both indicated that the substance was not dangerous.
Around 3 p.m., several law enforcement agencies and fire departments, including the Boston Fire Department’s hazardous materials team, arrived at the Law School.
According to Law School spokesperson Robb London, a faculty assistant for Dershowitz opened the letter and notified authorities after she saw that it contained white powder. London said that a preliminary test of the powder was negative for any substance that would have required further evacuation.
The Law School tweeted around 11 p.m. that a laboratory test conducted later in the evening did not indicate that the substance was hazardous and that Hauser Hall would reopen on Friday.
The assistant who opened the envelope, as well as three others who were present in the room, exhibited no apparent symptoms, though they continued to be monitored as of 6:15 p.m Thursday evening.
This is not the first time Dershowitz has received suspicious mail. London told The Crimson that the same faculty assistant opened a letter addressed to Dershowitz in January 2009 and discovered a white substance that turned out to be innocuous.
A 3:30 p.m. email from Francis X. McCrossan, the dean for administration at the Law School, told students, faculty, and staff to avoid Hauser Hall but noted that no other buildings were in danger.
Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison sent an email to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at 5:30 p.m. with information on the situation. The email said that the administration had no reason to believe any undergraduates were on the scene and advised avoiding Hauser Hall. Ellison sent another email to the FAS around 11:30 p.m. with updates on the substance’s negative test result.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the investigation.

The Harvard-Allston Task Force engaged in the first of a round of discussions on community benefits in Harvard’s new Institutional Master Plan for Allston development at a task force meeting Wednesday evening.
The nine-building plan, which Harvard hopes to file with the city around July 1, will include a section devoted entirely to community benefits. University representatives said these will be based on input from residents and the task force.
Allston residents’ opinions of what would constitute community benefits varied widely. Task force member Harry E. Mattison suggested planting trees along Western Avenue, while Allston resident Tom Lally pushed for transportation improvements.
“Allston has been clamoring for mass transit,” Lally said. “Build us a subway from Central Square to Watertown Square that goes through Allston.”
Boston Redevelopment Authority chief planner Kairos Shen said that mass transit is outside Harvard’s jurisdiction.
“The University should not substitute for state government,” he said. Shen added that the University could address transportation issues in Allston with the Harvard-Allston shuttle and the creation of new bike lanes.
Linda Kowalcky, deputy director of the BRA, presented on four preliminary categories of community benefits: public realm and open space, education, neighborhood infrastructure and amenities, and economic and workforce development.
Additionally, Kowalcky mentioned the inclusion of a project that would substantially improve the neighborhood, an idea originally referred to as a “transformational project” in Harvard’s first IMP for Allston in 2007. The 2007 master plan, which included designs for a $1 billion science complex, was halted in 2009 because of financial constraints.
Task force chair Ray V. Mellone echoed the need to pursue projects that could have a large impact on the community.
While the next few task force meetings have been scheduled to cover Harvard’s goals for educational community benefits, Kowalcky said that issues of transportation and housing will also need to be addressed in the coming weeks.
“At these meetings we’re not going to [solve] every housing problem or transportation problem or education problem,” Kowalcky said. “What we can do is try to identify what the key objectives are—what outcomes folks want to see.”
Wednesday night’s task force meeting was the first since two Harvard development plans were approved by BRA board review and was the first meeting this semester devoted entirely to community benefits.
Shen cited complaints about the fast pace of Harvard’s development as the impetus behind community benefit-oriented meetings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part III of a three-part series on gender disparity issues at the Law School. Part I ran on May 6, and Part II ran on May 8.
The law firm Brune & Richard is an anomaly. In a world where female lawyers represent fewer than 20 percent of partners in private practices, women make up 12 of the 18 lawyers at Brune & Richard.
And for founder Hillary Richard, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1988, that number makes a difference.
“What it presents for female lawyers, particularly younger lawyers, is an array of possibilities that they don’t see at other firms,” Richard said. “Women who come to work here know that being a woman is certainly not going to hold you back, is not going to be an impediment to partnership, and is not going to be an impediment professionally in any way.”
But when female students graduate from the Law School, most must grapple with the large gender gap in the legal profession, especially at the level of the most prestigious positions. According to a Feb. 2013 report by the American Bar Association, fewer than one-third of federal and state judgeships are filled by women, and only 15 percent of equity partners in law firms are female. Just 21.6 percent of general counsel at Fortune 500 companies are female lawyers, and women make up barely one-fifth of all deans in U.S. law schools.
Harvard Law professor David B. Wilkins ’77, an expert on the legal profession, said he thinks this severe gender disparity creates a vicious cycle that prevents many women from moving up in the field.
“I think it’s true as in many other places in society,” he said. “If people see people like themselves succeeding, they are more likely to succeed.”
At Harvard Law School, where fewer than one in five professors is female and women are regularly outperformed in the classroom by their male counterparts, graduating students are not immune to the pressure of entering a field dominated at the top by men.
A “FEMINIZED” PROFESSION, BUT NOT AT HARVARD
“Law is becoming a feminized profession, by which I mean the majority of the entrants to the profession are women,” said Wilkins, who described the breakdown in the United States as “50/50,” whereas worldwide “women make up the majority.”
Yet one would never get that sense from the campus of Harvard Law School.
More than six decades since the first women were admitted to the school, female students have never made up 50 percent or more of a class, according to Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Jessica L. Soban ’02, a former Crimson business editor.
A gender disparity is especially apparent in the most prestigious extracurricular activities, where women succeed in smaller numbers than their male peers.
According to Yvonne L. Smith of the Dean of Students Office, twice as many men as women made it to the semi-final round of the Ames Moot Court competition, a prestigious mock trial held annually by the school, and only nine of the 44 most recently elected editors on the Harvard Law Review have been women.
Valerie Duchesneau, director of student organizations on the Student Representative Board, pointed out that while most journals at the Law School have many women on staff, the Law Review is different.
“For me that’s why that statistic says something about there being a real problem,” said Duchesneau. “Somehow the Law Review gets a lot of the prestige that these other journals don’t carry.”
The gender gap at the Law Review is nothing new.
“When I was a student here from 1994 to 1997, I took the Law Review competition in the spring of 95, and of the 40 to 42 people who made the Law Review that year, only nine of us were women,” said visiting professor Laura A. Rosenbury ’92 in a video released by Shatter the Ceiling, a new coalition to address gender disparities. “I assumed when I came back to the faculty this year, that the Law Review would be close to 50/50. And it’s not.”
Students and faculty said there is no clear answer as to why certain extracurricular activities end up disproportionately male. The Harvard Law Review this year implemented a new gender-based affirmative action policy in an attempt to counteract the gap.
“There is, for lack of better terms, a hierarchy in terms of extracurriculars on campus,” said third-year Harvard Law student Stephanie E. Davidson, outgoing president of the Women’s Law Association.
TROUBLE AT THE TOP
And while the problem might start with student activities, it extends into the job market. Many in the Law School consider certain activities like the Law Review and Ames Moot Court to be important lines on the resume when securing top jobs after graduation.
Female graduates at the Law School find positions at private law firms less often than their male peers, according to Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark A. Weber. At the same time, he said, women tend to enter public interest work in greater numbers than men.
Nationwide, women make up 19.9 percent of partners in private legal firms, according to the American Bar Association.
Visiting professor Daniel R. Coquillette said that part of this disparity can be attributed to the fact that large law firms have “never made the accommodations they should make to family life.”
“I was an associate in a big law firm and I’ll tell you, it really is a very, very tough existence,” he said. “You might say that they treat men and women equally. And that’s true, they make it difficult for everyone, but under the conditions of modern society, it impacts women more.”
Wilkins agreed that typical legal careers, particularly at law firms where the key years in which lawyers become partners coincide with the time when many choose to start a family, are “not just made for a man but made for a man whose wife doesn’t work.”
“In a profession in which human capital is at its core, we are systematically losing out on the talent of very talented female lawyers who are leaving the profession altogether sometimes,” he said.
Wilkins helped co-author a study entitled “After the JD,” in which researchers surveyed lawyers in 2008 who had entered private practice in 2000. They found that at large law firms of 250 or more, men were five times more likely to have been made equity partner than women.
Weber said that while the statistics at the level of the top positions might paint a troubling picture, firms who hire HLS graduates soon after graduation treat candidates equally regardless of gender.
“What we’ve seen on the output side is that employers just want to hire smart, talented students,” he said. “It’s never an issue of gender. I’ve never seen employers say ‘We want to hire men.’”
Nevertheless, Wilkins said he thinks “unconscious bias and stereotypes” may play a powerful role.
“Whether they be clients or partners, when they think about a successful lawyer they are less likely to think of a female lawyer,” he said.
Richard said she thinks this issue is rooted in the low number of female partners. With a small number of women at the top, female job applicants find it harder to imagine their own success.
“I think with anything else, the more diversity that you have, whether its gender or race or what have you, I think the more it opens your mind to the possibility no matter who you are that there are jobs and careers open to you,” said Richard.
In lower courts, women fill more clerkship positions than men, according to Weber. But that dynamic changes at the level of the top positions. Among HLS graduates, far more men secure clerkships at the Supreme Court than women, a statistic often cited by the Shatter the Ceiling coalition.
“The higher you go in the profession, whether its Supreme Court Justices, partners in law firms, or deans of law schools, the number of women is smaller,” Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow said. “It’s not just Harvard Law School’s problem, it’s the legal profession’s problem.”

Richard J. Murnane, a professor known for his research on the intersection of economics and education, has been named acting dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, University President Drew G. Faust announced Thursday.
Murnane will begin his term as interim dean July 1, following the departure of current dean Kathleen McCartney, who will take over as president of Smith College after eight years at the helm of the Ed School.
“Dick Murnane has long been an admired leader within the Ed School faculty, recognized for his excellent scholarship and teaching, his wide experience and collegial style, and his deep devotion to the School and its beneficial impact on education policy and practice,” Faust said in a statement. “I am grateful to him for taking on this interim role, and I know he can count on the advice and support of people throughout the HGSE community.”
Murnane, who has been a member of the Ed School faculty since 1983, was trained as an economist, and much of his work has focused on the relationship between the shifting American economy and its education system. He said Thursday that he is honored to serve as acting dean as the search for a permanent dean continues.
“I am pleased to serve the School during this period of transition, ” Murnane said in a statement. “My colleagues and I are gratified by President Faust’s efforts to find a dean who will lead our vibrant School well.”
Murnane will delay a planned sabbatical until a permanent dean is found. In a message to the Ed School community Thursday, Faust said that the search is “progressing well” with the help of a faculty advisory committee and assistance from individuals across the University, but did not publicize a timetable for that search.
McCartney said that Murnane’s colleagues were “dancing in their offices” when they heard the news.
“I cannot imagine a better choice,” she said. “He’s an amazing person. He’s an amazing institution builder.”
Though the length of Murnane’s term is uncertain, McCartney said that she expects he will play a large role in crafting the school’s future.
“He’s an economist so he’ll understand how to build the school financially,” McCartney said. “I know he’ll make progress in our aspirations for the capital campaign and in our academic planning.”
McCartney first announced her departure last December. During her eight-year tenure as dean, she worked to diversify the school on all fronts, growing financial aid, hiring more minority faculty, and expanding degree offerings. In 2009, she helped launch a first-of-its-kind Doctor of Education Leadership Program. She also worked during her tenure to establish the framework for the school’s first Ph.D. in education, which is set to launch next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking off the cuff to a packed crowd in Memorial Church Thursday evening, Korean pop sensation Psy remarked on how strange it was to be giving a talk at Harvard.
Psy, who studied at Boston University and later Berklee College of Music in the 1990s, said that despite his proximity to Harvard, the University felt a universe away during his college days.
“After 14 years, who knew I came back to Boston give a speech in Harvard?” he said. “Isn’t life beautiful?”
Psy’s self-effacing humor shone through Thursday as he treated ticketholders to candid reflections, a free Korean meal, and a discussion of his unexpected success in the American music market. Sporting his signature black suit and sunglasses, Psy said he chose not to use a script for his speech, much to the surprise of event planners, because he wanted to give attendees an informal account of his life experiences.
“I’m not here to make something academic or educational,” he said.
In one humorous anecdote, the Seoul native recounted coming down with a terrible case of diarrhea and struggling to communicate with a pharmacist during his second full day as a college student in the United States.
Psy also reflected on “Gangnam Style,”­ the hit 2012 pop song that has since made him famous in America. He said that his intention when making the song was to cheer people up during a time of worldwide economic downturn.
“I really tried my best to be as ridiculous as possible,” he said.
Alexander Zahlten, an assistant professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, introduced Psy at the Korea Institute-sponsored event. Zahlten said that the fact that Psy’s “Gangnam Style” music video can be easily imitated and parodied by the public has been crucial to its success.
For his part, Psy offered another explanation for why his Korean music has achieved so much popularity among English speakers despite the language barrier.
“I think there was something beyond the language,” he said. “I think it’s fun. The word fun. All the people around the world, we like fun.”
Attendees at the event came dressed for the occasion, donning sunglasses in imitation of the pop star’s signature shades. One student even wore a horse mask in reference to Psy’s wildly popular music video for “Gangnam Style,” which broke the all-time record for most views on YouTube.
Students in attendance at the event commented on Psy’s good sense of humor and ability to work a crowd.
“I think he’s naturally funny,” said Alex J. Pong ’16. “He really read the audience well.”
To thank students for coming to hear him speak on the night before the College’s first official day of exams, Psy provided attendees with boxed dinners from Korean restaurant chain Bibigo upon exiting the church.

"Flyby!" you cry, "How will I get through this week?" Dearest reader, fear not! These are the foremost productivity hacks to help you survive finals week. Read it and weep.
1. Master your sleep cycle. All the cool kids know that sleep occurs in 90 minute cycles, which is why setting your alarm for an hour long nap never really works out too well. Wake up feeling refreshed by timing your sleep (read: naps) in 90 minute intervals.
2. Get off Facebook and Buzzfeed. Whether you love it or hate it, you're spending all of your time on it. We know—we've seen the computer screens in Lamont. To help us help ourselves, it's probably a good idea to check out Chrome/Firefox extension Stayfocusd, which can block certain sites after you spend a set time on them. For the freaks on Safari, check out Mindful Browsing. And there's always SelfControl.
3. Get comfortable. It's finals week, and if there ever is an acceptable time to wear pajamas in public, it is now. Take advantage.
4. Stuff your face. Ain't nothing like Insomnia to match your insomnia. Or some t-t-tasty, tasty (burger) for your Fergalicious self. Or some b.good to do good. Or some J.P. Licks to help you lick your final. Whatever it takes.
5. Reach out. Call your family (Mother's Day is coming up!), hang out with your friends, get off Facebook (see above) and get some face time. As much as you love studying, the weather's just too nice to be stuck inside.
