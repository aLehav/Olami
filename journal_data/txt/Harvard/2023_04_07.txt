After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You put on your headphones, walking home after another long day at school. You’re angry at the world, feeling full of self-doubt and more than afraid of what’s to come. You put on your headphones to escape. Suddenly, Chester Bennington’s vocals blare, Mike Shinoda’s rap verses punch, and the band’s instrumentals attack. Tired and confused by the clusterfuck that’s called life, you can finally let go and relax, letting the music do the fighting for you. That’s the kind of comfort “Meteora” — Linkin Park’s 2003 sophomore album — offers us in the darkest of times.
Following four weeks of lead single “Lost” charting on alternative & rock radio, rock-rap legends Linkin Park unveiled a 20th Anniversary Edition of “Meteora” on April 7. “Lost” was first officially released on Feb. 10 as the first pre-release from the album. The colorful anime images portraying the band members in the music video stunned fans, propelling the single to Linkin Park’s first #1 on Billboard’s Rock & Alternative Airplay Chart in more than a decade. The single isn’t the only unreleased gem the 20th Anniversary album brings; “Fighting Myself,” and “More The Victim” are just two of the songs from the “Meteora” sessions that Linkin Park worked on but never fully finished. Today, more than 20 years later, these new releases — along with live performance tracks from Texas, Nottingham, and more — force us to reconsider the album as a whole.
“Meteora” liberates.
The album itself cultivates a medium for rebellion. Songs like “Don’t Stay” and “Breaking The Habit” offer ways of breaking from the norm — from a toxic relationship, from a toxic label, from any dependence to an addictive setting. In answer to “Figure.09”’s lyrics “Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you,” “Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone,” from “Lying From You” is exactly the kind of answer we all need to get us through a hard breakup. On tracks like “Hit The Floor” the lyrical themes are reinforced by the screaming verses Bennington executes with just the right amount of rage, while Shinoda spits bars to support the beat. Throughout it all, the reassuring feeling of “you are not alone” fosters a safe space for the audience to rage against the machine.
“Meteora” meditates. 
The introspective — and at times excruciatingly raw — lyrics are doused in anguish. “Easier To Run”’s lyrical prowess shines in moments like “It's so much easier to go / Than face all this pain here all alone.” “Somewhere I Belong” is a masterclass in healing, despite the problems one faces along the way to self-acceptance. Even the wildly popular “Numb” offers contemplation; “And I know I may end up failing, too / But I know you were just like me / With someone disappointed in you” in the bridge is the epitome of loving thy enemy. Even though it is the most well known song Linkin Park has ever made, the intentionality of the lyrics don’t get overshadowed by the song’s success. With the addition of the Texas live performance version of this classic, we are able to reacquaint ourselves with its familiar melodies — almost as if hearing them for the first time.
“Meteora” astounds. 
The complexity of innovative sounds is not lost on the listener. The complicated beats mashed up with pop-drops come together in a symphony of dissonance — creating a sound that’s somehow so harmonic yet distinct at the same time. With the samples of Japanese bamboo flute on “Nobody’s Listening,” each of the unique layers in the melody become even more distinctive and recognizable as they are lifted to the forefront by the woodwind. Lyrically, Linkin Park astounds with the backwards lyrics on “Fighting Myself,” ​​​(ti stnaw eno on ,siht ot neppah reven ll'ti ,ti stnaw eno oN). “Faint” is a prime example of the driving tempo of Bennington’s vocals competing with the gritty guitar, strings, and pulsing cymbals — creating a song so busy that the listener is hanging off every word to grasp the meaning. “From The Inside,” on the other hand, leaves instrumentation taking over — as the waltzing tempo of the guitar riff sways the listener to the compound meter, bringing the music to the forefront for a change: The climax becomes almost alarmingly loud when it brings the guitar into the background, building off from that effect. The lyrical themes also compete; doubt, complacency, and fear clash with acceptance, refusal, and triumph. In a way, they resolve themselves, canceling out in a cathartic manner.
My generation grew up alongside Linkin Park. We witnessed the growth and flourishing of arguably one of the most influential artists of the 21st century. Albums like “Meteora” were a staple of our childhood — helping us through our teenage years and influencing us to this day. Following Bennington’s suicide in 2017, we were lost, mourning, in denial — unable to see a future for the band without the lead vocalist. With the release of the 20th Anniversary album, it’s clear Linkin Park will continue to be with us for many years to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year, around a thousand young people take a break from their professional lives, foregoing what can often be ludicrous salaries in consulting or finance to return to school.
What type of classes could reasonably convince an analyst at Goldman Sachs to put their promising career on pause? Honestly, probably none. Yet Harvard Business School still manages to attract over 8,000 applicants annually, some of whom (often on top of their foregone salary) shell out triple figures for a Master in Business Administration — and, of course, the social network that comes with the degree.
In my conversations with HBS students, I got the sense that the school operates more as an effective party host than as a teacher. You might read that with disdain. Yet I came away thinking that HBS has crucial lessons to offer on how we might deal with the networking culture present at our own college.
Isolated from the College and most other graduate schools by the Charles River, HBS exudes propriety and decorum. Walking through its 40-acre campus, amidst idyllic grass lawns and red brick buildings, I couldn’t help but shake the feeling that I was walking through a Sims city designed by a team of McKinsey consultants.
HBS’ most well-known degree, the two-year MBA, is based on a “case- and experience-based curriculum” where “students build deep general management and leadership skills.” Incoming students have an average of five years of work experience, with 32 percent of the Class of 2024 coming from a job in consulting, private equity, or venture capital.
To learn more about the school’s educational model, I talked to Carter W. Lewis, an MBA candidate at HBS. HBS classes use the case method, wherein students read documents detailing a problem faced by a real person leading a real organization. As a result, the classes are radically different than at the College.
“Folks will come to class with different arguments already kind of in mind, and then the teacher kind of guides discussion, and lets students interact with each other,” Lewis told me. “It’s very, very collaborative and interactive.”
Although the B-school lauds its academic curriculum as a way to enable its students to graduate with “grounding and practice in how to make difficult decisions and what it means to assume leadership in a global environment,” some students feel that much of the value of an HBS education lies in the networking opportunities it offers.
“I didn’t particularly gain a lot from finance and accounting classes,” Lewis told me. “For me, the benefit is definitely more so in the network of people, and taking advantage of opportunities to travel with new friends.”
This networking culture at HBS is undeniable. Referring to the MBA ecosystem, Celia A. Stafford, a PhD candidate at HBS, told me that “the entire point is networking, and so it can become very transactional a lot of the time.”
“It’s very common at HBS to get an email or a text or like, a message from somebody you don’t know asking to get coffee,” Lewis told me. “You don’t know if there’s an angle there, because they know you work in a certain field. You don’t know if it’s because you might have a mutual friend, and they just want to get to know you.”
As Cameron R. Armstrong, a 2020 MBA graduate, wrote in a Substack post about his experience socializing at HBS: “I felt the exact moments when people stopped paying attention to what I was saying because they decided this whatever military guy from Georgia couldn’t help them get their next private equity internship or job or something. I saw the instant the light of focus fade in their eyes as conversational autopilot took over and they subtly searched for another person to chat up.”
I found this description striking because it was so familiar to me – and it may be to you too. I'd be lying if I said my own conversational autopilot hasn't lit up at a reception or two. Students have long decried the College’s culture of “destructive social networking,” arguing that it “creates a culture of transactional relationships and absurd standards.”
The HBS students I spoke to recognized the potential drawbacks of this networking culture. Stafford told me, “There are times where I’ll be meeting someone and it becomes clear very quickly that I am not somebody, my parents are not somebody, so there’s not all that much they can gain from me.”
But I was also surprised at how understanding and approving some students were of this culture.
“I don’t dislike it, because I think I understand it,” Stafford said. “It’s worth it for the networking opportunities, and the job, and the education, and it’s an incredible place to be. Really, truly, I feel so unbelievably blessed. But I do think there’s a little bit of a, ‘Okay, if it’s a necessary evil, this helps me achieve my goals.’ So I’m willing to be exhausted for two years.”
Should we at the College learn to embrace networking culture as some of those at HBS have? Maybe our complaints about transactional relationships are less of a valid criticism and more a failure to take advantage of the privileged position we’ve been put in. That could be true.
Yet I think there’s a more cutting criticism to be made of the networking culture that HBS fails to fully respond to. The networking efforts made on campus translate to membership in an elite social network after graduation. This process has gone on so long that even those who never made an effort to network will still be granted membership to this exclusive club by virtue of graduating with a degree from HBS.
“There is definitely an HBS bond that you will always be connected to whomever,” Stafford told me. “If I needed it, I would be able to call them and be like, ‘Hey, I graduated from HBS with you, remember when you came to my Whiskey, Bourbon, and Spirits Society event? I need a job.’”
When I asked Lewis how much of HBS’s contribution to its students was the brand, he answered, “ninety-seven percent.” Of course, he said, some students who come to HBS with little financial experience do learn a lot from accounting classes. Yet everyone benefits from the Harvard name.
There’s something unsettling about this exclusivity. My dad used to say, “What defines a club isn’t who’s in, but who’s not allowed in.” Does the education received at HBS and the College really merit the benefits it brings? In other words, is this hyper-elite club justly formed?
I’m not going to try to speculate about the ethics of exclusivity. I will say, though, that in dealing with this problem, we should remember the second part of John Rawls’ second principle of social justice: Any social and economic inequalities that exist should be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society. If this club is going to exist, Harvard should make some effort to ensure its graduates contribute to the public good.
We’re already starting to see this in some sense. New HBS courses, like “Reimagining Capitalism” and “Capitalism and the State,” are forcing students to confront the inequities inherent in capitalism. At the College, too, we’ve begun to see efforts to promote equity and inclusivity. Administrative actions, like the creation of the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Forum, have placed these values closer to the center of the conversation. Similarly, even at the student level, we’ve seen historically elite social clubs begin to prioritize diversity and inclusion.
As others have pointed out, this reality still leaves a bad taste in our mouths. We might be more comfortable condemning the existence of institutions as exclusive as HBS and the College as a whole. In a way, that’s almost the simple and easy opinion to have.
We shouldn’t throw the baby out with the bathwater, though. I think there’s a way to embrace this networking culture and the post-graduate benefits it brings while still grappling with important social justice issues. This means questioning our assumptions and critically examining vestiges of unjust exclusivity, so that everyone has the fair opportunity to access these social ecosystems. Only in doing so can we justify the existence of the Harvard club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We can both recall the precise moment the reality of the climate crisis came crashing down on us. For Anna, it was in 2022, in Jackson, Mississippi:
Last year, my hometown made national news as a water crisis kept nearly 150,000 residents, including my family, from safe drinking water. Systemic disinvestment in water infrastructure and climate change are at the heart of Jackson’s water crisis. Tucked away in my corner of campus, I prayed for my mother and father, that their bodies would not be poisoned. I wished for protection of the babies bathing in contaminated water. My heart changed as it thirsted for justice and protection of that which is sacred: water.
For Maya, it was the day the sky turned red in Northern California:
"I stepped outside of my house and felt my breath leave my body. Even today, I find it difficult to express the disorientation of looking up at the sky and seeing a milky red haze, the color of light pouring through skin; it felt like God had closed their eyes. I can remember the despair, paired with a deep confusion. As fires ravaged my home county, I was living in a state of hyper awareness, checking the alerts on my phone to see if my family would need to evacuate. But in that moment, all I could do was stare up at the sky, mouth agape."
Although we live in different states facing distinct impacts of the climate crisis, both of our homes are bound by a shared reality: this time, the crisis is profoundly urgent.
While climate change has material implications, the environmental devastation also has urgent psychological, spiritual, and social implications given the toll that loss of life (human and non-human), habitat, and livelihood have on human wellbeing. Recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Climate Council of Australia, as well as studies published in Nature and PNAS, note that climate change is linked with 1) an increase in climate-related anxiety and PTSD, 2) a rise in the likelihood of armed conflict, and 3) growing suicide rates among farmers. To mitigate these potential outcomes, communities will need to deploy social and spiritual resources to attend to the emotional fallout from ecological devastation, especially for communities of color which climate change disproportionately impacts.
In times of crisis, humans turn to spiritual leaders; spirituality has been integral to some of the most formative movements of the past century. Faith leaders are among the most effective people to spark action, and we see examples of ecotheological thought across nearly every major religion. As spiritual practitioners, we believe that land and spiritual wellbeing are deeply interconnected. This is not a revolutionary notion. Indigenous leaders have been raising the alarm that our spiritual and physical realities are intertwined for centuries. We must listen to and learn from them as we mobilize collective, spiritually rooted action worldwide.
More recently, we have seen the potential for spiritual leaders to activate communities around critical climate action: the leaders of Standing Rock mobilizing collective action around the sacrality of water, Pope Francis’ Laudato Si’, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ donation of 5,700 water shares back to Great Salt Lake, the joint Appeal signed by almost 40 faith leaders ahead of COP26 in 2021. Chaplains and spiritual practitioners, including ourselves and our classmates at the Harvard Divinity School (where we’ll be gathering April 10-14 for Climate Justice Week), are offering spiritual care to people in the wake of climate disasters and in the face of climate anxiety.
Climate action is often discussed through a lens of policy, science, and infrastructure, especially here at Harvard. These interventions are, of course, essential, yet climate change asks more of us. Acknowledging our impact on the earth demands that we contend with bigger questions like: What is the role of people on this earth? How do we care for each other during increasingly challenging times? How do we live well, live sustainably, treat the land and its species as sacred? How do we find strength and courage to walk forward with an open heart in the face of devastation?
These are the questions we ask as we look at red skies and wonder if our loved ones have clean water to drink. The grief, disorientation, and despair of these moments will find healing in community and spiritual care. If we spend more time responding to these questions, just maybe our planet will heal too.
As we look to the next decade — which will determine just how much temperature change our world will experience — we cannot afford to disregard the existential nature of what we are facing. Our earth will be forever changed. We are being asked to love a world of increasing chaos and difficulty. We must turn to one another, look at the fires and poisoned water, and ask ourselves what more we can do. Our future is at stake.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I moved into my Harvard University Housing residence last summer, I had to furnish an entire apartment for a family of four. I would only use the apartment for 11 months.
My strategy was to try to live as minimally and cost-efficiently as possible, which meant regressing to college-style sleeping on a mattress and drinking from containers not meant for beverages. In the dead of the summer humidity, I dragged downstairs a poorly-made secondhand table by myself and spotted a neighbor similarly battling a mattress to the curb all on her own.
The number of furniture items casually abandoned on the streets of Boston and Cambridge during move-in and move-out season is a novelty for newcomers. Neighbors call it “Allston Christmas.”
Many items seem to get picked up, but many others still end up in landfills. We have all heard of ‘fast fashion’ and the negative impacts this kind of consumerism has on the environment, but it seems that there’s a culture of ‘fast furniture’ here as well. This collective annual repetitive waste is a disaster for the environment, and universities should take action to prevent it.
Harvard University Housing provides approximately 3,000 units of housing to graduate students, faculty, and staff. But currently, only around 250 of these units can be identified as furnished. Most units require occupants to acquire furniture when they move in and dispose of it when they leave. Approximately 50 percent of the units turn over each year, which means this phenomenally wasteful practice of fast furniture can be repeated regularly.
Producing the average piece of furniture generates 47 kilograms of carbon dioxide — the equivalent of burning approximately 5.3 gallons of petrol. One of the worst offenders is the mattress, whose foam material is conventionally made of nonrenewable virgin fossil fuels. Producing one full-size mattress costs approximately 79 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions, and according to IKEA, only 13 percent of the foam can be recycled.
If each savvy renter buys just one mattress and one other piece of furniture during their transient stay in Cambridge (an optimistic assumption), that would result in 126 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions. This is the equivalent of powering 77.1 gasoline-powered vehicles a year for the total approximate 2,750 unfurnished units of housing.
The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference’s commitment to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require us to reduce emissions globally by 43 percent by 2030. But simply attending my one-year program at the Harvard Kennedy School has increased my share of emissions more than reducing it.
To be fair, the city of Cambridge overall does a fairly good job of diverting and recycling waste. Many lucky renters inherit free items by simply walking around during Allston Christmas. Harvard’s Recycling and Surplus Center provides free, used University furniture, and there are free service organizations that arrange for group furniture donation pickups. There are also various informal and formal private marketplaces to upcycle secondhand.
But this obvious strategy is frustrated by the time and cost burden placed on students. The leakage in refurnishing rental units is not absolute in every situation, but simply seeing the items left on the streets of Cambridge and Boston will affirm that there’s room for improvement.
Too many graduate students take the path of least resistance. Facing limited time, logistic, physical, donation, and priority restrictions, many of us — particularly families — buy far more than a few mattresses. Aside from environmental impacts, the amount of money, stress, and time this pattern of fast furniture generates is frustrating and unnecessary.
Rather than contributing to fast furniture, Harvard University Housing should increase the number of furnished units, providing students with basic pieces of furniture such as beds, desks, tables, and chairs (which every student needs) — similar to what undergraduates receive. Not only would providing (partially) furnished units lift the unnecessary and regressive burden of furnishing units from students, but it would also be more in keeping with Harvard’s own sustainability goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by “the maximum practicable rate.”
Harvard University Housing has said that the number of furnished units they provide will likely not change over time. Is the current low percent of furnished housing really the maximum practicable rate?
As I get ready to leave Harvard at the end of the spring term, it’s time to figure out what to do with the fast furniture and household goods I myself bought less than a year ago. Some of the items are so poorly made that I’ll probably have to pay someone to take them to the dumpster by June 31 when my lease expires. And when July rolls around, there will be a new crop of graduate students who will face the same dilemma and hassle all over again.
Until Harvard University Housing decides to address the climate impact of furniture waste systematically, it is up to each of us to consume less to stop the planet from overheating: one mattress at a time.

Valeria Luiselli is a visiting professor of ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration in the English Department. Luiselli is the author of several books including “Lost Children Archive,” which was longlisted for the Booker Prize.
FM: You were born in Mexico City and grew up in South Korea, South Africa, and India. Which do you feel most attached to?
VL: I think South Africa, in terms of the countries that are not Mexico, where I grew up. And I think the reason for that is that I spent the last drops of my childhood there — my transition into teenagehood, and into a much more politically conscious age.
I was there during the transition to democracy in South Africa during Nelson Mandela’s administration, so it was a particularly intense political time. For the first time, I inhabited the world politically, so to speak, understanding that we were political beings and that something was changing. It was a very, very intense time, so I remember it very vividly.
FM: You teach a course called “Plundering the Americas: Histories of Extractive Violence and Creative Resistance in the Americas.” How do you approach creating and discussing work centered around the ideas of empire and U.S. imperialism here in the U.S.?
VL: I think that we look at different instances in which official modes of knowledge — national archives, or final histories of nations — have congealed versions of history.
We try to go into the cracks of those archives and extract from those cracks the possibility of understanding what has been left out from them, what has been voluntarily silenced — in an engineered kind of silence, or in some cases just through a kind of inertia.
During the time of Obama, there was a document, a kind of “pardon,” or an “ask for an apology” written by the United States government, directed at Native American peoples. The document lists a shopping list of wrongdoing, so to speak, all beginning with the word “whereas.”
It’s a very disquieting document because of all the things it does not really say about the horrors of genocidal imperialism and colonization. And we saw one example of a response to that archive, which is this wonderful poem by Layli Long Soldier called “Whereas,” and she responds to this document with her own were “whereases.”
FM: What made you start teaching?
VL: Survival.
I had to start teaching while I was doing my Ph.D. I had some experience with teaching before that, and I had dreaded it. I taught English to businessmen in Spain. So it was a very bad experience of teaching. But then I started teaching as a graduate student — because that’s part of your responsibility as a graduate student — and for the first time, I actually really enjoyed it. I taught courses in language, but also in Latin American literature and culture. And that’s where something changed in my view of what can be done through teaching. And from then on, I really enjoyed the practice of it, and the commitment to teaching.
FM: Alongside your writing, you have also been involved in political advocacy, notably translating for children in immigration court and teaching creative writing to incarcerated girls in New York City. Is the impulse to do this kind of work different from the impulse to write or make other art? 
VL: I think the impulse, or the pulse more than the impulse, might be a similar one. But I understand the limitations of one form and the other, and try not to aspire to more than what one form can achieve. So I know, in my case at least, that writing fiction in particular is not the best tool for political denunciation or activism. Some fiction can lead the readers to think as an activist or to act, but it’s not something that I would like to think about when I’m writing fiction. But then, on the other hand, when I’ve written nonfiction in the past, like “Tell Me How It Ends,” I did have a much more political agenda in mind.
How is writing a tool for reshaping accepted narrative, a narrative that forms a very congealed part of the collective imagination? And how do you reshape that collective imagination through thinking about narrative differently? How do we reshape the view of the migrant as an inherently victimized figure or as an intruder of sorts by thinking, for example, of migration in its kind of heroic arc? Of the migration story not as a tragedy, but as a form of epic?
FM: Can we say then that non-fiction can do certain things that fiction can’t? And vice-versa?
VL: I think each genre has its limitations and its scopes. I don’t know that they can be very scientifically marked and regulated. I wouldn’t say that the essay inherently is an instrument of political change and action, whereas the novel can’t. I think that kind of prescriptive attitude toward writing might do very well in a creative writing class of some sort, because people want rules and people want a takeaway, but that’s not actually how it is. It’s much messier than that. It’s very difficult to be normative about literature in that way or about the practice of writing.
FM: How do you know which medium or genre feels right for the story you want to tell?
VL: Trial and error. For ages. For four years now I’ve been working on a novel that until two weeks ago had no shape. And now I’m only starting to find an architecture within it; it was just a collection of notes.
Four years it’s taken me, and the result is that it’s both fiction and nonfiction. I couldn’t decide which one this time, so both.
FM: Was there a moment when you decided to become a writer? 
VL: I think there were many moments in which I aspired to become a writer. There were certainly many years of writing and realizing that writing was the activity that gave me the most profound forms of intellectual and emotional pleasure, joy, curiosity, satisfaction, also frustration and fear.
It was not until when I was an undergraduate student studying philosophy at the UNAM.
I met a girl my age, who is to this day like a sister to see me. We were smoking a cigarette outside class — you smoked inside and outside class in those days, but we were respectively smoking right outside class, not inside class — and I asked her her name. I’d been seeing her for weeks and I thought she was very interesting and I wanted her to be my friend, but I didn’t know how. And I asked her her name and what she did and who she was. And she said she presented herself like a writer. We were 19 years old, and I was like, “What do you mean? A writer?” I know it might sound trite these days, but I really had never read a female writer of fiction. Also, I was studying philosophy, not literature, so I came to literature on my own and later. But in high school, I had read only guys, really. Maybe I had read some Juana, the Mexican poet.
So it was really important for me to hear someone my age who considered herself a writer. And I think after that it became a realistic perspective to me.
To this day, every Monday, we check in, and we tell each other what we’re working on that week, where we’re going, if we did what we said last week, if the chapter is working or not, and we have a very tight discipline that’s now more than two decades long.
FM: What books in your life shaped you the most?
VL: Brodsky’s essays, that collection “Less Than One.” Anne Carson’s “Plainwater” is one of my favorite books. It’s such a beautiful book. Juane Rulfo, “Pedro Paramo.” I think it’s the best novel that has ever been written. Really plainly so. But there’s so many that it’s a very unfair question, so I’m only going to give you three. I mean, I could say Ovid’s “Metamorphosis,” for example, that I read over and over and over and over again. So maybe that too.
FM: Your book, “Lost Children Archive,” is full of literary references, and you reference classics such as Ezra Pound, Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot. It seems like our time has a tricky relationship to these kinds of authors, the very classical authors with the classics, trying to find their meaning while wrestling with the fact that they’re written in very different times. Why and how do you still hold onto these classical texts? 
VL: Why do I enter into conversation with other writers so overtly? I think first of all because that is very much my process in writing. I find it difficult to write if I don’t often stop to read and look at how others have done things before me. It’s what orients me. I get lost very easily, because I don’t write linearly: I write in a completely scattered way. It takes me time to build the cartography that I can navigate without getting lost. Once I build it, I can jump from A to B to C, but in the building of that cartography, my orientation posts — my lighthouses, so to speak — are usually other other writers.
FM: You’ve published extensively in both English and Spanish, sometimes assisting in translations of your own work. Does the language of the story change what’s being said?
VL: I’ll never know.
If I do it in one language, I’ll never know what it could have been in the other one. It’s just a mystery that I just have to live with.
Some things might be said more humorously in one language than in another, or some things lose that kind of vibrancy. But I don’t think that, inherently, a language produces, in me at least, prose that is more humorous or more melancholic or more anything. It has to do more with the moment and the material itself.
FM: As you were writing your novel “The Story of My Teeth,” you sent chapters to be read to factory workers at the Jumex juice factory weekly in Mexico. The workers would read the chapter out loud, sort of critique them, and send their thoughts back to you and then you’d revise the chapters accordingly with their criticism and then continue that process. My initial question is why did you decide to do this? But I guess a connected question is part of that, for you, figuring out a blurring of the lines between the writing that was produced by you versus writing that’s produced communally?
VL: Thanks to that mode of writing, I have more and more thought of collective experiences of writing or collective modes of documenting. The project that I’m working on is a lot more collective — like, brutally collective.
I don’t know if I was too conscious of it while doing it, but I think it taught me how to write in a way and how to listen in a way that has informed my work since.
One of the things that I was really interested in trying to understand was just how they understood their own place within this very complicated ecology created by the geographical proximity between the factory and this art gallery in the same plot of land and they belong to the same company.
Their tireless work during the day produces the revenue and the surplus of money that eventually goes into buying this expensive contemporary art that exists in this gallery that’s kind of vacuum packed and really well air conditioned, while the factory is super hot. And I really wanted to hear their views on that disconnection and connection.
FM: Do you have a reader in mind when you write?
VL: More than a reader, I have a ferocious critic in my head.
Sometimes it’s really important to read yourself through the lens of some kind of other critic, but also it’s really important to unlisten sometimes, because it’s really hard to produce creative work if you let those inner critics take over.
FM: The New Yorker said of “Lost Children Archive” that it “confronts the complexities of bearing witness.” Where do you draw the line between documenting pain as opposed to exploiting it? 
VL: For me, it’s very important not to document pain as such. My books and my projects moving forward don’t reproduce the narratives that do a kind of pornography of pain. They don’t go into the details of violence.
That line for me is clear. It’s what should be clearly drawn. And it’s hard as a reader because the testimonies I come upon are brutal. But then as a writer, I don’t see my work as simply reproducing that archive.
FM: You write about people and topics that are very close to you. Do you see yourself in your stories, or do you keep a certain distance?
VL: I don’t really care much for autofiction. I just simply use the material that I have. Sometimes it begins with a family scene that then gets processed into something fictional as soon as it’s embroidered into a text. If that was originally true or not, if I was actually there, if I was in that scene — it doesn’t really matter to me. What matters to me is how to write fiction.
FM: What message would you give to an aspiring writer?
VL: Other than the typical one, which is you have to read and read and read?
Don’t fall into the trap of an MFA; rather, do a Ph.D., unless the MFA is tuition free and giving you a stipend. In that case, yes, if you’re being treated like a graduate student and have compensation for your work and research, fantastic.
MFAs are often a bit of a trick for people. So, don’t fall into the trap. Do a Ph.D.; it’s free.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. Census Bureau plans to release documents for academics to use to assess potential racial bias in redistricting, after the Harvard Law School’s Election Law Clinic requested the materials through the Freedom of Information Act, the agency announced March 27.
The Election Law Clinic — in conjunction with law firm Selendy Gay Elsberg PLLC — filed suit against the Census Bureau last October on behalf of Columbia University political science professor and department chair Justin H. Phillips, seeking to enforce a FOIA request that Phillips had filed in July 2022.
Academics hope to use the data files Phillips requested to determine whether data privacy techniques first used in the 2020 Census underrepresented people of color in redistricting processes. A group of more than 50 individuals, including professors, Ph.D. students, and industry professionals signed an open letter the Election Law Clinic sent to the Census Bureau in September 2021 requesting the files.
The Census Bureau declined to comment, saying that they do not respond to ongoing litigation and referring the request to the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.
Differential privacy — the data privacy system used in the 2020 Census — aims to preserve information about groups of people while masking information at an individual level. The Census accomplishes this by randomly varying individual data points — referred to as adding noise — in a way that does not alter the data’s aggregate properties. A differentially private algorithm was applied to the raw census data to create a “noisy measurements” file.
In July 2021, Harvard Computer Science professor Cynthia Dwork, Election Law Clinic director Ruth Greenwood, and Harvard University Professor Gary King wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed that though the post-processing algorithm applied by the Census Bureau to the noisy measurements file is “quite helpful for some purposes,” it also “introduces biases that are difficult to correct for others” — a conclusion also reached by Harvard Government and Statistics researchers in a May 2021 study.
“Fortunately, making available the noisy measurements file is an easy solution and the key to ensuring that analysts can easily use the data appropriately,” the op-ed stated. “That file will allow analysts to correct for all biases (with straightforward statistical methods easy to make available to all) and to offer accurate margins of error.”
In an interview after the Census Bureau’s announcement, King said that “now for the first time, we can find out” if the 2020 Census contained biases. To do so, he hopes to use statistical techniques to determine “how the different racial groups are voting.”
Greenwood said the noisy measurements would allow researchers to assess potential concerns over bias in the 2020 Census.
“It will give us some sense of if there are places that are undercounted. There was some belief that, perhaps, Native American communities in tribal areas — because of the low population density — would end up appearing to be undercounted in the final census and that may have consequences for federal funding but it could also have consequences for representation,” she said.
Third-year law student Delaney I. Herndon, who is in her third semester at the Election Law Clinic, spoke about the nature of student involvement in the case.
“I was not involved on the project last semester but joined the team this semester as we were preparing for a potential motion for summary judgment, and I’ve been working with the clinic on the case as we’ve been interfacing with the Census Bureau and opposing counsel this last semester,” she said.
Herndon, who plans to clerk after Law School, said that she “hopes to work in the election democracy voting space long term.”
Despite the Census Bureau’s March 27 announcement, Greenwood said “they haven’t set a date” for the release of the noisy measurements.
“In the rest of the case, we can still seek to have a judge set a date for the release of the 2020 file, and so that isn’t resolved yet,” Greenwood said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers from Harvard Medical School, the University of Geneva, and Ludwig Cancer Research published a study last week suggesting neutrophils can play an important role in improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes.
The study, led by HMS professors Allon M. Klein and Mikael J. Pittet, found that mice and human cancer patients had different outcomes based on levels of different types of neutrophil found in their blood and tissues. The researchers published their findings on March 30 in the journal Cell.
Immunotherapy, a form of cancer treatment, aims to eliminate tumors using the body’s immune system machinery. But the varied outcomes of patients treated with immunotherapy have been a topic of ongoing scientific research.
“There are therapies that work and we don’t know why, and there are therapies that don’t work and we don’t know why,” said Nicolas A. Gort Freitas, a Ph.D. candidate in Systems, Synthetic, and Quantitative Biology who works in Klein’s lab.
Traditionally, immunotherapy utilizes the adaptive immune system — including T cells and B cells — to recognize and attack specific antigens such as tumors. Neutrophils, short-lived white blood cells in the innate immune system that circulate rapidly through the human body, have been largely overlooked by researchers due to their observed role in promoting tumor growth, according to Klein.
Gort Freitas said the study revealed “heterogeneity among neutrophils,” separating “evil” cells that contribute to tumor growth from “good” cells that combat cancer. Experiments in mice showed this latter subset of neutrophils was abundant in successful treatment. When the researchers intentionally blocked these neutrophils, however, treatment efficacy decreased.
“Every single time that a therapy succeeded in our animal experiments, we saw a large neutrophil response, and when the therapies failed we saw that the neutrophils weren’t doing too much,” Klein said.
Neutrophils are not the only cells in the innate immune system that have been misunderstood for their role in cancer progression, according to Christopher S. Garris, an assistant professor of pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital and contributor to the study.
“This happened with the macrophage. It happened with the dendritic cell, Garris said. “As we further get better techniques — like single cell RNA sequencing — to subdivide and cluster new cell populations and make distinctions, we’re going to find there’s going to be good ones and bad ones.”
Klein said the research can help improve immunotherapy treatments by activating tumor-fighting neutrophils in patients in conjunction with interferon therapy.
“These neutrophils, they look like they have a pattern which shows that they’re responding to a particular signaling molecule called interferon,” Klein said. “Interferon is an immune modulator molecule, so combining different types of immunotherapies could simultaneously activate the T cells.”
While the findings of the study are promising, Klein said it is “an absolute imperative” to continue research of neutrophils in humans.
“At this point, we just know that they’re important,” said Klein. “But the precise way in which they act, we’ve only really sketched out in some very broad outlines.”
Klein said he believes scientists should take a more holistic approach to cancer treatments.
“There is already active attention on how to bring the innate immune system into the story more closely,” said Klein. “I suspect that there’ll now be even more attention on how to bring neutrophils into immunotherapy and to target neutrophils specifically.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amazon President and CEO Andy R. Jassy ’90 discussed failure, innovation, and the future of technology at a Thursday lecture moderated by School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III.
Jassy, 55, joined Amazon in 1997 after receiving his MBA from Harvard Business School, holding various leadership roles in the company before founding Amazon Web Services. Harvard partners with AWS on research efforts on topics including quantum networking and solving global challenges through data science.
Jassy, a former Crimson advertising manager, began the event by discussing his philosophy on how to build and manage innovative teams, underscoring decentralized product development and moving fast with reversible “two-way door” decisions.
“We over-index hiring builders. We think of builders as people who like to invent,” Jassy said. “People who like to look at customer experiences, figure out what can be better about them, and seek to change them or reinvent them.”
Jassy, who succeeded Jeff Bezos as president and CEO of Amazon in July 2021, credited Amazon’s success to its willingness to launch new projects and innovate.
“We say yes to a lot more new ideas than most companies,” Jassy said.
Throughout the talk, Jassy discussed the importance of embracing failure.
Jassy said the Fire Phone — Amazon’s short-lived entry into the smartphone market — was an example of strong execution and risk-taking, though it ultimately did not succeed. Still, the project’s team was rewarded for their work and subsequently placed on other high-priority initiatives, which Jassy described as a “cultural, reaffirming experience.”
Reflecting on Amazon’s history, Jassy said tolerance for failure and iteration is one of the reasons the company continues to innovate.
“Almost all the most important lessons I’ve learned have been through failure — professionally, academically, all of it,” Jassy added.
During the talk, Doyle said he believes Jassy’s lessons about failure are applicable to academic and research experiences at Harvard.
Jassy also discussed his views on the future of technology and generative artificial intelligence.
“It’s unbelievable,” Jassy said about large language models. “The models have gotten so much better so quickly over the last nine months.”
“Literally, almost every customer experience has a chance to change. And I think it’s one of the most exciting, important technology opportunities and changes since the Internet,” Jassy added. “So that is incredibly exciting.”
Beyond his career, Jassy also discussed his avid interest in sports, appreciation for family, and focus on education and racial equity through the organization Rainier Scholars, a nonprofit he supports.
Asked about career advice, Jassy encouraged exploring diverse interests, saying he had initially intended to pursue law before realizing it was not the right fit for him.
“You don’t have to know what you are going to do right now in college,” Jassy said. “Try things and see what you like. Don’t feel like you have to declare early.”
“Pick the things to do here, or when you get out of school, that you’re passionate about right now,” Jassy added. “Having something that you wake up in the morning and that you’re excited to do really matters.”
Doyle wrote in a statement following the event that SEAS invites top executives from tech companies, like Jassy, to share their perspectives at lecture events.
“He had numerous pearls of wisdom that he shared with our students,” Doyle wrote. “I was struck by his encouragement to be confident, challenge ideas and ask questions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Asifa Majid, a William Bentinck-Smith Fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, presented her findings on the building blocks of language and conceptual variation during a presentation Monday.
The lecture, titled “Language and Thought,” centered on how language bridges thought and communication as well as the distinct properties that emerge from this connection.
During the lecture, Majid, a psychologist and professor of Cognitive Science at the University of Oxford, detailed the importance of fieldwork in her research of conceptual variation, or the differential representations of the same idea.
“Fieldwork to me is important because you want to go where language lives to improve the ecological validity of our findings,” Majid said. “It helps examine the nexus of culture, language, and daily discourse practice.”
Majid said collaboration is crucial in her field of study, stressing that “one single person can’t do this.”
“I work with people who are committed to long-lasting, or long-scale, descriptive work in communities around the world,” Majid said. “They’re either doing fieldwork, or they’re native speakers themselves with expertise in these languages.”
Describing a study in which she and her colleagues investigated global responses to smells, Majid described how their findings identified a universal response despite differing languages.
“We look at the muscle movements of the faces and we can see that there’s a strong correlation in which smells elicit a disgust response and which ones elicit a more pleasant response,” Majid said. “What that suggests is that there’s an initial universal emotional reaction to odors, and then later cultural-specific packaging for language.”
Throughout the lecture, Majid highlighted the importance of increasing diversity in linguistic studies, using maps and statistics to demonstrate the geographical inequity in current research priorities.
Though language diversity is greater in Papua New Guinea and Africa, Majid said, it is relatively smaller in Europe. Majid cited a 2008 study showing that in contrast, 68 percent of psychological study participants come from the U.S., 14 percent come from the U.K., and 13 percent come from the rest of Europe — with just 5 percent coming from the rest of the world.
“This paper caused a big furor in the field and yet, when we look again a decade later, hardly anything shifted at all,” Majid said.
Majid finished the lecture by stressing the importance of expanding research beyond Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic — or “WEIRD” — linguistic study participants.
“More broadly, I think what it tells us is that we really need to go beyond our WEIRD participants to think about diversity,” Majid said.

Weekend closures of Memorial Drive will return April 30, but only on Sundays, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation announced Monday — despite resident calls to maintain the full weekend closures of the past three years.
The DCR tweeted the decision to close the road Sundays until Nov. 12, which drew criticism from some Cambridge residents and Harvard affiliates for defying the Cambridge City Council’s vote to keep Memorial Drive closed to vehicles on both Sunday and Saturday.
City Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80 responded to the DCR’s tweet, tagging and asking Massachusetts Governor Maura T. Healey ’92 to keep the road closed on Saturdays as well.
“Thousands of residents and overwhelming majority in the neighborhood and on city council want it,” she tweeted. “Democracy and responsive government will prevail.”
In October 1985, the Massachusetts Legislature approved a law to close a portion of Memorial Drive to vehicles from Western Ave. to Gerry’s Landing Road from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. every Sunday to create a space for recreation. The closure, according to the law, begins at the end of April and continues until mid-November.
In 2020, however, the DCR began closing Memorial Drive on Saturdays in addition to Sundays, at the request of the Cambridge City Council. The Saturday closures continued alongside the required Sunday closures through 2021 and 2022.
Cambridge residents and Harvard affiliates previously shared how the closure of Memorial Drive on Saturdays yielded significant benefits at a Feb. 13 meeting. At the same meeting, other residents living on side streets affected by increased traffic during these closures asked the city to keep the road open Saturdays.
The traffic closures enjoy support among many Harvard undergraduates, and some have taken concerns to the public comment sections of prior City Council meetings.
“I can’t believe that they’re thinking about stopping closing the road,” Zoë A. Clark ’26 said.
Clark said “the experience of being out in open air is much more than any traffic jam that these other people might face,” referring to the resulting increased traffic that Cantabrigians have bemoaned at City Council meetings.
In an interview, Councilor Marc C. McGovern said the traffic is not “as bad as what some people have made it out to be,” adding he lives in the affected Riverside neighborhood.
“When you see hundreds of people enjoying the river, I can sacrifice a couple minutes of my time,” he said.
On the DCR’s decision itself, McGovern said he “would think that, at the end of the day, creating more opportunity for people to recreate and to get out will probably be more in line with their mission.”
“They are the Department of Conservation and Recreation — hard to have a lot of recreation on Memorial Drive when you get cars zipping up and down at 50 miles an hour,” he added.
DCR spokesperson Ilyse Wolberg wrote in a statement to the Boston Herald that the road is returning to its pre-Covid schedule. Full weekend closures came with “concerns about elevated traffic and pollution in surrounding residential neighborhoods,” according to Wolberg.
“While this effort was a success in expanding access to outdoor recreation, it was not without its negative impacts,” Wolberg wrote.
The Harvard College Democracy House, in partnership with the Walkable Mem Drive campaign, circulated a petition Tuesday among Harvard students against the DCR’s decision to limit the traffic closures to Sundays.
“I’m skeptical of the claims of Riverside residents that complain about increased traffic on other streets,” Micah I.K. Williams ’23-’24 wrote in an emailed statement. “Either way the goal should be to reduce car travel overall, and the city/state are entirely capable of taking action to do this.”
“The problem isn’t Riverbend Park — it’s cars,” he added.
In a Tuesday message to the Dunster House email list, Williams wrote that he hoped to organize a protest Saturday in support of Saturday closures.
“If DCR won’t shut the road down, we can shut it down ourselves,” he wrote.

Harvard Medical School instructor Robert H. Goldstein will serve as the next commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the DPH announced in a press release Monday.
Goldstein, who will assume the role on April 18, currently works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a senior policy adviser and at Massachusetts General Hospital as an infectious disease physician.
A graduate of Tufts University, Goldstein said he became passionate about public health after helping HIV patients during his residency at MGH, which led him to pursue a fellowship in the MGH/Brigham and Women’s Hospital infectious disease program.
“You can’t be an HIV doctor and not be interested in public health — they go hand in hand,” Goldstein said. “We need a robust public health system to take care of people who are at risk for HIV and living with HIV because they’re oftentimes the most vulnerable in our societies.”
“My work in HIV medicine, and my work with those most affected by HIV — in particular, the LGBTQ community — meant that I had to be interested in, integrated into, and a part of the public health system,” Goldstein added.
In the press release announcing the appointment, Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen E. Walsh said she will work with Goldstein to address critical issues for Massachusetts residents, highlighting the importance of “health equity, inclusion, and reducing barriers to care for the most vulnerable communities in our state.”
“It was a no-brainer to say yes to this, to be able to work with such an amazing team and get to do really interesting and impactful work,” Goldstein said. “What I’m excited to do is to work alongside the people that have been at the department for many years and also to bring in new people who will continue that commitment and further that work to really reduce the structural barriers that are in place.”
Walsh said Goldstein’s experience in both clinical and policy settings “positions him well to lead the public health response in Massachusetts.”
Margret R. Cooke, the current commissioner, will shift to an advisory role for seven months following the start of Goldstein’s appointment to “support a smooth transition at DPH,” according to the release.
Asked about specific plans for addressing structural barriers to medical care accessibility, Goldstein said he wanted to start by learning from current DPH officials in order to see “what is working well and what is not working well.”
Still, Goldstein discussed the plans he intends to pursue once he assumes this position, including those related to potential negative impacts to the accessibility of healthcare following Massachusetts’ plan to end the public health emergency for Covid-19 on May 11.
Goldstein said ending the Covid-19 public health emergency could negatively affect those seeking treatment for substance use disorder, people seeking gender-affirming care, or people who live in rural parts of Massachusetts.
“As a department of public health, we need to be at the table with others including folks at MassHealth and the Department of Mental Health,” Goldstein said. “What do we do for the people who still need those substance use treatment programs and those providers, but can’t access them because they don't have a car to drive to where they were getting care virtually?”
As a policy advisor at the CDC, Goldstein was closely involved in the federal government’s response to Covid-19 as well as the monkeypox outbreak in 2022, which was successfully controlled.
Goldstein said an “unspoken” public health challenge he wanted to address was rebuilding “the trust that people have in public health.”
“Over the past three to four years, trust in public health has decreased,” Goldstein said. “That’s a huge impact in our ability to get people vaccinated, in our ability to educate people about common sense gun violence prevention strategies, in the opportunities we have to connect people to reproductive care and access services to decrease maternal mortality.”
In light of the public health workforce deficit, Goldstein said his educational work at HMS has been focused on “exciting people about public health, getting people interested in public health as a career, and making them realize the power and the impact of public health.”
“Even before Covid started, we were down by tens of thousands of public health workers across the country,” Goldstein said. “Now, at the end of the public health emergency, we are in not much of a better place.”
Goldstein emphasized the importance of getting undergraduates to explore public health careers.
“Public health is really exciting,” Goldstein said. “We need to start rebuilding that workforce, and no better way to start than with really eager and excited and really smart people who are in college and universities right now.”

Claire S. Yoo, a senior at Idaho Falls High School, said she was so nervous waiting for the results of her early action application to Harvard College that she took an “hour-long shower.”
She was “shaking” as she navigated to the applicant portal.
“I clicked it — and the confetti went everywhere,” said Yoo, who started screaming as her mom ran into the room.
“We all came downstairs and started jumping around,” Yoo added. “It was the best day of my life. Like, genuinely.”
Yoo is one of 1,942 applicants to the College who opened their admissions portals on Dec. 13, 2022 and March 31, 2023 to confetti and the word “Congratulations!” — an official welcome to the Class of 2027.
The 1,220 students accepted during regular decision last month join 722 admits from the early action cycle, who learned of their acceptances in December. The 1,942 admitted students were selected from a total applicant pool of 56,937.
The College admitted 3.41 percent of applicants, marking a slight increase from last year’s 3.19 percent and the second-lowest acceptance rate in the College’s history.
Dev S. Ahuja, a member of the incoming class from Cleveland, Ohio, described Harvard as his “dream school” but said he was deferred after applying early action to the College.
On Ivy Day — when all eight Ivy League schools release admissions results — he planned to open up decisions in alphabetical order, with his parents and grandmother in the room and sister on FaceTime. Still, he decided to save Harvard for last.
“Then I just saw the status update,” Ahuja said. “I took a deep breath. And then I hit the button. And immediately I saw the confetti and I jumped out of my chair.”
Jason Coreas, a senior attending Avalos P-TECH School in Houston, Texas, opened his decision with his mother and brother at his side.
“I opened it, and then the three of us were bawling our eyes out,” Coreas said.
Coreas said his mother, who immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico at age 18, “dreamed” of him attending Harvard. As a first-generation college student, Coreas said getting accepted to the College meant “making every single person” in his family proud.
For Stephanie Yakoff, a senior from Fort Lee, New Jersey, who committed to playing tennis at Harvard during her junior year, opening the status update wasn’t such a surprise.
Still, Yakoff said she is looking forward to meeting other members of the class during Visitas, the College’s admitted students weekend, on April 23 and 24.
“Definitely hoping to meet new people and learn more about how Harvard works in general,” Yakoff said.
Yakoff said she has already started to connect with other admits through social media.
“Through Snapchat and Instagram we have all these group chats, through LinkedIn, Discord. So I’ve met, I would say, a good 30, 40 percent of the Class of ’27 now,” Yakoff said.
For Nana Yaa P. Dwomoh, a high school senior from Brookings, South Dakota, decision day coincided with her mother’s birthday.
“The whole day, she was like, ‘All I want for my birthday present is for you to get into Harvard,’” Dwomoh said.
Dwomoh opened her Harvard decision alongside her parents and younger siblings, whom she described as her “motivation.” She said she wanted her siblings to know they could “achieve things like this” and not be discouraged by racial barriers or being from “such a small town.”
“I feel like this was the best example that I could set for them. And so I was crying, seeing their reaction and their happiness,” she said.
Dwomoh — who moved from Ghana to the U.S. during elementary school — utilized organizations like First Gen Scholars and the College For All Program to navigate the admissions process. She immediately texted her mentor after her acceptance.
“And he called me immediately, and he was crying,” Dwomoh said.
Olivia Pan, a senior from Middleton, Wisconsin, said the night before early decision results were released, she had a dream — that she was rejected.
When Pan opened her decision, however, confetti floated across her computer screen.
“I was crying, so I couldn’t speak,” Pan said.
Dominic W. Sheeks, an admit from North Baltimore, Ohio, decided to take a gap year after graduating from high school in 2022. During his time off, he interned with the Hancock Public Health Department on drug addiction policy before applying in the early action cycle.
Though some of his teachers were worried that Sheeks wouldn’t attend college if he took the gap year, Sheeks said it was “by far, one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.”
“I’ve had so much personal and professional growth and gained so much insight into the recovery field but also myself,” he said.
Sheeks said his acceptance to the College was a “full circle moment.”
“I didn’t apply to Harvard for the prestige,” Sheeks said. “But to be able to go to the most competitive university in the nation when years ago, I didn’t even see myself graduating, is very surreal. And I’m definitely very humbled by all of it.”
Correction: April 13, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Claire S. Yoo was accepted to the Class of 2027 during regular decision. In fact, she was accepted early action.

Maryland District Court Judge Julie R. Rubin ruled in favor of the Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Clinic in a lawsuit against the United States Department of Agriculture in a March 23 decision.
The clinic — which filed the suit in November 2019 on behalf of animal rights advocacy groups Rise for Animals and the Animal Legal Defense Fund — challenged the USDA’s denial of a petition submitted by the plaintiffs. The petition called for the USDA to improve the standard for the treatment of primates involved in research, alleging that the agency had violated the Administrative Procedure Act.
Rubin sided with the plaintiffs in her opinion, concluding that in its decision to deny the petition, “the Agency did not consider evidence relevant to the subject matter it was tasked with deciding, that it failed to offer a plausible, reasoned explanation of how it considered relevant public comments, and/or that it failed to explain the basis for its conclusion that there were no relevant public comments.”
The USDA did not respond to a request for comment.
In a brief filed in support of a motion for summary judgment during the lawsuit, the USDA argued that its denial letter for the petition met the required standards because “all that is required by the USDA is to ‘adequately explain[] the facts and policy concerns it relied on and [whether] … those facts have some basis in the record.’”
Caitlin Foley, a senior attorney at the Animal Legal Defense Fund, said there are multiple ways the USDA could respond to Rubin’s decision.
“They’re going to have to come up with either a way to implement some of the things that we are requesting in the rulemaking or go back to the drawing board and try to figure out another way to achieve the same aims,” she said.
Foley added that the decision is unusual and that she sees this case as a “good win.”
“These usually aren’t really successful cases when you challenge an agency’s decision-making just because of the deference that’s given to an agency’s determination to deny a petition for rulemaking,” Foley said.
Rubin is also presiding over another lawsuit filed last April against the USDA by the Animal Law and Policy Clinic on behalf of the same plaintiffs. In this case, the clinic challenges a policy that it argues was “secretly implemented” by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service — a subdivision of the USDA.
According to the complaint, APHIS “relies on third-party accreditation by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care,” which the clinic alleges violates the Animal Welfare Act’s requirement that the agency must “conduct full annual inspections of research facilities.”
Katherine A. Meyer, director of the Animal Law and Policy Clinic, said in an interview that she felt hopeful about the pending case, adding that Rubin’s recent decision was “in very favorable language to our position.”
Meyer also said Rubin’s decision provided the clinic’s students with a valuable teaching moment, saying that it is “really great for my students to see that what I’ve been teaching them is correct.”
Ashton F. Macfarlane ’17, a third-year Law School student who works at the clinic, said that he could not have “imagined a better conclusion to this particular case.”
“It’s just incredibly rewarding to see so much of the language that we worked on and wordsmithed and thought about, hoped that maybe a judge would take seriously and to see not just a handful of our arguments, but almost every argument we made endorsed by the judge in this flamboyantly positive way is phenomenal,” he said.
Ed Butler, executive director of Rise for Animals, said he wishes the USDA will take action on the verdict in this case.
“We’re hoping that they will do the right thing by the animals and adopt a practice that will help improve the lives of these animals,” Butler said.
Butler said Rise for Animals will continue to fight not just for policy change at the USDA but to end all animal lab testing.
“Certainly, make no mistake, we would like all the animals out of these labs,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Academy Award-winning actress Michelle Yeoh will serve as Harvard Law School’s 2023 Class Day speaker, the school announced Wednesday.
Harvard Medical School also revealed that its Class Day speaker would be Emmy Award-winning neurosurgeon Sanjay Gupta in a March 17 press release. The Medical School’s Class Day events take place on May 25, after Commencement concludes.
The Law School’s Class Day festivities, which will take place on May 24 — one day before Commencement — seek to celebrate the graduating class. The day will feature awards and speeches, including Yeoh’s keynote address.
Yeoh, originally from Malaysia, began her acting career in Hong Kong, taking roles in a number of action and martial arts films. She later moved to the United States, receiving critical acclaim for her work — which includes lead roles in “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.”
She garnered an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” marking the first time the honor went to an Asian actress.
Outside of her acting work, Yeoh has served as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations since 2016, advocating for causes including ending poverty and promoting environmental sustainability. Yeoh also serves as the vice president of the board of the Suu Foundation, which works to improve the lives of people in Myanmar.
Yeoh found the invitation especially “meaningful” because her father was a lawyer, according to a Law School press release.
“It is a tremendous honour to speak at Harvard Law School’s 2023 Class Day,” Yeoh said in the statement.
Harvard Law School Dean of Students Stephen L. Ball and the Law School’s class marshals announced the news in an email to graduating students.
“We are thrilled to welcome Michelle Yeoh to campus to celebrate our commencement and help us mark this important milestone,” they wrote. “As an acclaimed actress and advocate for so many important causes, she will undoubtedly inspire us, the Class of 2023, as we prepare to make a difference in our world and in peoples’ lives.”
Gupta, who will be the Medical School’s Class Day speaker, is CNN’s chief medical correspondent and an associate of neurosurgery in Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital. He has won multiple Emmy Awards for his work hosting “Sanjay Gupta MD” and reporting on Charity Hospital in New Orleans amid Hurricane Katrina.
Gupta also reported on the first surgical operation on the battlefield during the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and also joined the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division in 2009 while it performed rescue missions in Afghanistan.
In a Medical School press release, Gupta said he was “thrilled and honored” to give the Class Day address for “future leaders in health care.”
“As it has been 30 years since my own medical school graduation, I will humbly offer some of the lessons I have learned over that time,” he said in the press release.

Harvard University Police Advisory Board Appoints Undergrad Rep After Yearlong Vacancy

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department Advisory Board — tasked with overseeing HUPD’s commitments to transparency and campus engagement — has lacked undergraduate representation since the graduation of its only College student member in May 2022.
Noah A. Harris ’22, the former president of the Harvard Undergraduate Council, was the only undergraduate on the board. Harris’ position on the board has been vacant since his graduation in May 2022, leaving the University’s police force without any formal undergraduate oversight.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that the board is still without an undergraduate representative and did not respond to a request for an updated list of members.
“The committee has been actively reaching out and connecting with several people in attempts to fill the position,” Newton wrote in a Wednesday statement.
In a February 2022 meeting, the HUPD Advisory Board provided feedback on a series of forums proposed by the University’s Reimagining Community Safety working group and offered advice on updates to the HUPD’s crime and workload dashboard.
In an interview with The Crimson last week, board chair Tim Bowman — the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ dean for administration and finance — said the Advisory Board will continue to seek input from different stakeholders within the University to attempt to increase diversity in membership.
“We’ll go to those stakeholder groups who know their community the best and ask them to give us names,” Bowman said.
“I believe that we are in the process of transitioning me off of the board and on-boarding new members,” Osiris Rankin, a Psychology student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, wrote in a Thursday statement. He also confirmed he is still a current member.
The Crimson reached out to each of the Advisory Board’s 13 members as of 2022 — representatives from across the University’s schools, including professors, administrators, and students — to inquire about progress made on the board’s initiatives. Eight did not respond to requests for comment, three declined to comment, and two responded: Bowman and Rankin.
“We have met as a board on multiple occasions this year, including recently,” Rankin wrote. “In our meetings, we have discussed department initiatives such as those related to hiring, promotion, training, emergency response, transparency, and communication.”
The Advisory Board was formed in response to a December 2020 external review that called for significant reforms for greater accountability within the department. The review came in the wake of a January 2020 Crimson investigation surfacing a pattern of racism, sexism, and alleged favoritism within the department. In June 2020, longtime HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley announced plans to retire.
Bowman said the Advisory Board is looking into whether or not HUPD officers should always respond to mental health calls or if “there are other ways the University can respond” instead.
“Some people feel a little overwhelmed when Harvard University police is the one unlocking the building for them,” Bowman said. “And it may not be even the best use of their time.”
HUPD has faced heightened scrutiny in the aftermath of a “swatting” attack on Monday, which saw at least five HUPD officers raid a Leverett House suite equipped with riot gear and assault rifles. During the encounter, officers ordered the four College seniors in the suite out of their rooms at gunpoint.
Newton, the University spokesperson, declined to comment on Monday’s “swatting” attack. Four of the board’s members also declined to comment on the matter.
HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay wrote in a Wednesday statement that the officers were responding to a caller who claimed to be armed and holding a woman hostage in the suite.
Rankin wrote that the HUPD workload and crime dashboard team has met with experts and stakeholders outside the Advisory Board. He added that he discussed a newer version of the dashboard with HUPD within the last month outside of the board’s regularly-scheduled meeting.
“The dashboard incorporates community feedback on ways to effectively and transparently share information with all of Harvard and the general public,” Rankin wrote. “This includes information on calls to the HUPD and actions taken.”
HUPD’s workload and crime dashboard has not been updated since June 2021.
After the board’s February 2022 meeting, Bowman told The Crimson that “it’s early for us to try to be issuing recommendations,” and the board members were “bringing ourselves up to speed.” More than a year later, the board has not publicized any formal recommendations it has issued to HUPD.
“The reputation of HUPD at Harvard, I think, is starting at a positive place, and I realize there’s always been some issues and concerns that in many ways is systemic of just policing in the United States in general,” Bowman said in last week’s interview.
“But I think it’s been a very effective, very positive organization,” Bowman added. “How can we now even take that further and improve upon that?”

As Claudine Gay prepares to move from her station in University Hall to the president’s office across Harvard Yard, one of her most important tasks will be to select her own successor as the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Encompassing more than 1,000 tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty; more than 7,000 undergraduate students; and thousands of graduate students, the FAS constitutes Harvard’s largest academic school, and according to its own website, the “historic heart of Harvard University.”
Gay and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 are leading the search for Gay’s successor, which was formally launched in February, alongside an advisory committee of 12 professors from across the FAS, a Harvard Business School professor, and Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82.
In past searches, top contenders have tended to possess substantial administrative experience and a deep familiarity with the structure and governance of FAS.
Gay herself was the dean of Social Sciences when University President Lawrence S. Bacow offered her the position. Her predecessor, Michael D. Smith, was the associate dean for computer science and engineering prior to becoming FAS dean, and his predecessor William C. Kirby had served as the director of Harvard’s Asia Center and a former History department chair.
The other top candidates for the role of FAS dean shared these characteristics. Before former University President Drew G. Faust tapped Smith for FAS dean, she reportedly offered the role to Geophysics professor Jeremy Bloxham, the divisional dean for Physical Sciences at the time; however, Bloxham rejected the role.
In the search that ultimately appointed Kirby in 2002, Faust herself — then the dean of the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study — was a contender, along with Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Peter T. Ellison.
Of the three current divisional deans — Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs, Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey, and Dean of Social Sciences Lawrence D. Bobo — Stubbs declined to comment on whether he was interested in the position in an interview this week, while Bobo said last week he was uninterested.
Bobo also stressed the importance of familiarity with the FAS, saying he hopes “they lean toward an insider” for the position.
Diana Sorensen, a former dean of Arts and Humanities who served on the advisory committee during the 2018 dean search that ultimately selected Gay, said the candidate had to have administrative experience.
“It has to be somebody who’s been the chair of a department, the director of a center, a divisional dean, you name it, but somebody that has a sense of what it takes to be a strong leader, as an administrator and as a faculty member,” Sorensen said. “The two pieces have to come together.”
With the search now in motion, several FAS professors spoke with The Crimson about their hopes for the successor to Harvard’s most powerful dean.
For years, Harvard’s presidents and FAS deans have been concentrated in the social sciences.
Bacow, Harvard’s current president, has a background in economics and public policy, while Gay is a scholar of political science and African American studies. Though Gay’s predecessor, Smith, is a computer scientist, he replaced Kirby, who researches Chinese history. Smith served under Faust, a historian, while Kirby served under Lawrence H. Summers, an economist.
But members of the faculty say that the next FAS dean does not necessarily have to come from a particular academic background.
“Where someone comes from, I don’t think that that’s always necessarily a good indicator of where they’re going to go, what they’re thinking, and who they are,” Woodward Yang, a professor of Electrical Engineering, said. “I think that that’s kind of a poor metric.”
Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, a History professor, said the next dean’s academic background matters less than their ability to communicate with faculty across a range of disciplines.
“In thinking about who would be an effective candidate, one of the most important criteria, in my view, would be that whoever be picked be somebody who is able to understand and work with people across all the divisions in the FAS,” Jasanoff said.
Philosophy professor Edward J. “Ned” Hall echoed Jasanoff, saying that the next FAS dean should have “broad understanding of the range of research that Harvard supports and ought to be supporting across different divisions” in addition to a “compelling vision for what a good liberal arts education is going to be.”
“It’s not any one academic discipline,” Hall said.
Venkatesh N. Murthy, a Molecular and Cellular Biology professor, said he would “love to see” a scientist fill the deanship, although he noted a scientist dean is unlikely to be “science only, science first.”
“I would like to see maybe a bit of balance, where let’s say the FAS should perhaps be more in the science-leaning side of things, but of course somebody who’s very, very active and knowledgeable about social studies and policy and things like that,” Murthy said.
“Not just like a nerd scientist,” he added.
Wesley M. Jacobsen, a professor of the practice of Japanese language, also called for “a balance” between the sciences and humanities, saying that scientists need a humanistic perspective to address “increasingly critical issues about human survival, human existence.”
“We need scientists who can communicate, we need scientists who are concerned about social issues, about human life on this planet,” Jacobsen said.
He said that while “breadth of vision” is more important than a dean’s specific background, Kelsey, the current Arts and Humanities dean, would “make an excellent FAS dean.”
Murthy said he would “personally be delighted” if Stubbs, the current Science dean, were selected as Gay’s successor. In emails, chemistry professor emeritus E.J. Corey and astronomy professor emeritus Robert P. Kirshner ’70 also said they felt Stubbs would be a strong candidate for the deanship.
Whatever their background, the incoming FAS dean will be tasked with shepherding Harvard’s aggressive shift toward the sciences.
In recent years, the University has significantly upped its investments in scientific research and education, including a $200 million donation by Melanie Salata and Jean E. Salata to establish the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability; a $500 million investment funding the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence from Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan ’07; and the opening of the $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex, which houses the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, a division of the FAS.
Still, some professors said Harvard should further assert itself as a leader among institutions of higher education in science and technology.
Murthy, the MCB professor, said he feels the change in leadership is an opportunity for Harvard to stop “playing defense mode” and instead be “proactive” and “set the agenda for the world.”
Every faculty member has “their own slightly selfish take on things,” Murthy said; his view is that Harvard ought to “influence policymakers” in fields such as public health, biomedicine, and artificial intelligence, which he said the school has not prioritized in recent years.
“Should we just let this go to the School of Public Health?” Murthy said, referencing public health and Covid-19 research. “Or should FAS engage in this?”
Compared to other universities, Murthy said Harvard “can’t afford” not to lead in STEM.
“Stanford is always in the news, MIT is in the news all the time,” Murthy said. “What are they known for? I would argue they’re known mainly for science and tech.”
In order for Harvard to “stay competitive at all in the sciences,” Mansi Srivastava, an associate professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, said the University needs to address graduate student and postdoctoral researchers’ demands for increased support and compensation.
“I think if Harvard is going to be realistic about what’s happening in the sciences, they have to contend with the fact that we cannot take the position that, ‘Oh, we’re Harvard, so the best people will come here regardless of what the salaries are,’” Srivastava said.
Matthew D. Shair, a chemistry professor, said an FAS dean from the life sciences would be well-positioned to lead the school’s advancement in scientific research.
“One of the jewels of our department are the life sciences,” Shair said. “I’d love to see somebody in the FAS deanship with a deep understanding of what it takes to achieve excellence in the life sciences.”
“I think that’s challenging for someone who doesn’t work in that area,” he added.
Shair said he hoped the next dean will “foster” opportunities for collaboration across different scientific departments and with the biotechnology private sector in Boston and Cambridge.
“That would be very exciting to me personally and, I suspect, to a number of my colleagues,” Shair said.
While some professors push for a reinvestment in the sciences, other professors raised concerns about Harvard’s priorities shifting away from the humanities, reflecting a growing trend in higher education. The next FAS dean, they said, ought to reaffirm the importance of the liberal arts.
Professor Derek J. Penslar, whose research focuses on Jewish history, said he feels Harvard should send a “stronger message coming from the top” about the importance of a humanistic education.
“The dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is responsible for the liberal arts, broadly understood,” Penslar said. “And this is why I think a strong message from the dean of FAS regarding the essentiality of all of the subjects taught in the College would be very important.”
Jacobsen, the Japanese language professor of the practice, said he hoped the next FAS dean would combat what he saw as “a trend against the humanities” at Harvard.
“There was kind of a concern that humanities concentrators are going down and may not be as serious at Harvard as at other places,” Jacobsen said. “My concern would be that humanities are held up as a centrally important part of the Harvard undergraduate education.”
According to Hall, a more robust liberal arts education at Harvard would require the University to take a stronger stance on promoting academic freedom.
“I’ve talked to a lot of students who come here thinking like ‘I want the liberal arts experience!’ and they think, ‘Oh, and I don’t really get it because everybody’s cautious about what they talk about,’” he said.
Steven A. Pinker, a Psychology professor who has been outspoken in the movement for increased academic freedom, urged Gay and Garber to select an FAS dean “with a steadfast commitment to disinterested inquiry, civility, objectivity, reason, scholarship, and freedom of speech and thought” in a Feb. 17 letter obtained by The Crimson.
“The Dean must not only believe in these values but be willing to use Harvard’s pulpit to speak out for them, and to ensure that they predominate within Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences,” Pinker wrote.
In an interview, Pinker also said the next FAS Dean should display “a commitment to academic freedom, and a commitment to securing the credibility of the academy and the professoriate.”
Penslar said that rather than trying to compete with other institutions such as MIT in the sciences and applied sciences — a costly endeavor, he added — Harvard should consider pursuing more partnerships between the two schools.
“It seems to me that Harvard and MIT together could make up the finest educational consortium in the world,” Penslar added. “But from an outsider’s perspective, from my perspective in history, it does seem odd for Harvard to be apparently duplicating what has done so well at MIT.”
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment for this article.
Hall, the Philosophy professor, said “the decline of the humanities across colleges and universities in the United States is a pretty serious matter.”
“Having a new FAS dean who saw that as a serious problem, and maybe one that didn’t just require throwing resources at the humanities, but demanded of the humanities that we think hard about what our mission is and how to make that mission legible to young people, someone with those sort of priorities would be great,” Hall said.
At the monthly FAS meeting in February, Gay told faculty attendees that she and Garber would read every email sent to a dedicated dean search email address.
“I really can’t overstate the importance of your input in this process,” she told faculty at a subsequent meeting in March.
Shair said that faculty “should be very involved” in the search.
“I think it would be great if the committee or members of the search committee visited each FAS department for 45 minutes or an hour and heard at a faculty meeting what’s on their minds,” Shair said.
Srivastava, the OEB professor, said she felt that the process was open to her feedback, adding it was consistent with her perception of Gay as an “amazing listener.”
“I think they’re talking to lots of people,” she said.
She added that she attended one of a handful of “small group discussions” for tenure-track faculty to share their perspectives and knew of another discussion for non-tenure-track faculty.
The structure of this search mirrors that of 2018, with the incoming president and provost at the helm and a faculty committee in an advisory capacity. Sorensen, who served on the advisory committee in 2018, said that the nomination process was “very open,” and that the committee narrowed down an “expansive” list of nominees to a shortlist.
But, she confirmed, the final decision came down to Bacow and Garber.
“As we always knew would be the case,” she added.

Amidst one of its most successful seasons in program history, Harvard track and field split between Texas, Florida, and Massachusetts last weekend for the third week of its 2022-23 outdoor season. Sophomore Izzy Goudros was the first to compete for the Crimson at the Texas Relays of the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). Goudros represented Harvard well, setting a new school record for the women’s heptathlon with a score of 5637, putting her in seventh place at the meet and in the NCAA standings.
Over at the Florida Relays, the Crimson continued to set more records.
“[The] Florida Relays was a super exciting environment,” junior sprinter Lance Ward said. “There were lots of Olympic-level athletes there, including Rai Benjamin, Noah Lyles, and Erriyon Knighton, some big names on the American side.”
“We were right there next to them and everybody kind of brought their A game,” Ward continued. “We’re just continuing to improve and Florida Relays was an awesome place to do that.”
Senior Stephanie Ratcliffe threw 70.15 m to win the women’s hammer throw and break her previous school record by nearly three meters. Her mark in Fla. puts her first in the national league at two meters further than any other collegiate athlete has thrown this season. Her teammate, sophomore Anastasia Retsa, also improved on her school record, jumping 4.18 m to take second place at the relays. Senior Sarah Omoregie also made it on the podium, throwing a personal best in the women’s shot put with a mark of 17.21 m to take third place at the meet and put her sixth place in the national league.
Sophomore Kenneth Ikeji threw a 72.48 m hammer throw, giving him the silver medal and replacing his previous school record. Senior Alexander Kolesnikoff also had a record-breaking throw on Saturday, throwing 20.05 m in the men’s shot put to win the event and become the first Harvard athlete to throw over 20 meters. He now leads the nation with this mark.
Senior Aaron Shirley who had previously set the school record for the men’s 400 m hurdles last week took first place in the event with a time of 50.75 seconds. Senior Samuel Bennett also won his race in the men’s 110 m hurdles, running a time of 13.79 seconds in the preliminaries to break the school record and 13.56 seconds in the final to win the race.
Shirley was also a part of the Harvard record-breaking men’s 4x400 m team, along with juniors Gregory Lapit, Peter Diebold, and Ward. The team of four ran a time of 3:07.79 seconds, taking second place and shaving almost a second off the previous record.
“The 4x400 [relay] is always that event at the end of the meet where everyone's a little bit tired, but everyone comes together and gives it their all,” Ward reflected about the event. “Everyone is watching and cheering and everybody loves the [race] due to the nature of how difficult it can be.”
“I was particularly fatigued coming into the race, but I looked at the other guys around me and I knew that we were all gonna do everything in our power to run the best race that we could and we were doing it for each other — that’s what we did. It turned out pretty great,” Ward reflected.
Sophomore Victoria Bossong ran a time of 2:07.11 seconds in the women’s 800 m run which puts her fourth in program history.
Over at Dartmouth, Harvard had three athletes earn the gold medal.
Sophomore Jeremiah Swett threw 43.74 m to win the men’s discus throw in a competition of 20 athletes. In the same event for the women, first-year Michaela Denson also won with a throw of 43.30 m. Senior Kyle Murphy also won his event, jumping 13.34 m in the men’s triple jump to earn himself first place.
This weekend, Harvard will host Yale, Oxford, and Cambridge for the historic HYOC meet this Saturday, April 8 on McCurdy Outdoor Track where Harvard and Yale will team up against Cambridge and Oxford.
“I think we’re all coming into this weekend pretty excited,” said Ward about the Crimson’s upcoming home meet. “We actually happen to be teaming up with Yale this weekend which usually doesn’t happen.”
“It’s kind of a little Atlantic rivalry there — we’re all kind of excited about that. It’s a historic tradition that goes back quite a ways. It occurs every two years. We’re all looking forward to that, it’s pretty historic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team has had a busy week. A three-game sweep over Brown this past weekend and a doubleheader against Massachusetts neighbor Merrimack have bolstered the Crimson’s confidence as they wade through the depths of midseason play.
“We just passed the halfway point of our season, so we are really focusing on getting to our best softball,” sophomore lefty Savannah Fitzpatrick said. “We can end Ivy play strong and go into the Ivy tournament feeling good [and] feeling confident in ourselves.”
Battles with Brown (5-19, 2-7 Ivy) last Friday and Sunday indicate the team is heading in the right direction. The Crimson (16-9-1, 7-2) bested the Bears 3-1, 6-2, and 7-0, showcasing consistent output at the plate and formidable defense in the field.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1  
Junior Madi Mays set the pace early in game one, sending junior Lauren Bobowski home with a first-inning single. Senior infielder Teagan Shaw produced the rest of the scoring in that same inning, knocking in two more runs with a single. She later put up a single in the bottom of the sixth.
When Brown put Harvard away in order during the bottom of the third, the Crimson needed to lock in the batters’ box.
“Our pitching staff is definitely one of the strongest in the Ivy League,” first-year Riley Flynn said. “We can all start and finish games and we can all come in for each other.”
Flynn came in clutch in the final 2.2 innings on Friday, relieving Anna Reed and striking out two. Reed walked away with the win, striking out four and walking none.
Senior Megan Welsh capped off the game with a thrilling catch. The right fielder rammed into the wall to rob Brown’s Jasmine Hsiao of a homer.
HARVARD 6, BROWN 2
The first Crimson player to approach the plate on Sunday, Bobowski started the scoring for Harvard. She reached on a full-count error, then stole second, later hustling home after a groundout two at-bats later. The Crimson managed to fill the bases and score one more, closing the inning ahead 2-0.
In the sixth, Bobowski finished off the scoring with an RBI double that scored Kaitlin Lampson and was then batted in by a double from senior Allison Heffley.
Sophomore Katie Arrambide pitched the first six innings, striking out three, walking two, and earning her fourth win of the season.
HARVARD 7, BROWN 0
In game three, Harvard only needed one pitcher: Flynn. In her 17th appearance for the Crimson, the righty struck out four and allowed only two hits.
Flynn acknowledges that “it's a big jump coming out here [to Massachusetts],” but credits upperclassman guidance for her strong first campaign. “[They] are able to help me navigate anything from classes to social to softball and anything in between.”
Payne and Shaw batted in two apiece in the first frame, giving Harvard a 4-0 lead. Arrambide scored on an error in the second, and a fifth-inning single from Douglas sent two more home to cap off Crimson scoring for the day, 7-0.
Harvard currently stands in step with Princeton at the top of League standings, and the Crimson has big hopes as they roll into May.
“Our goal is obviously to win the Ivy League championship,” Flynn said. “Right now we are in a good position to do that. We are definitely working towards that every day, whether in practice or in games.”
To reclaim their 2019 tournament title, stolen by Princeton in last spring’s championship, daily diligence is crucial.
“We are really focusing on taking each game at a time, each series at a time,” Fitzpatrick said. “You’re seeing a lot of upsets each weekend, so we are trying to stay dialed in before we worry about games down the line.”
Harvard will ride this five-game win streak straight to Hanover, N.H. on Saturday for a three-game set against Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James Blake ‘01, the former Harvard tennis star who reached a career-high ranking of No. 6 in the world in 2006, wears many hats today: tennis player, commentator, tournament director, charity director, author, public speaker, and many more. Ten years after retirement, Blake continues to break barriers as he brings his life and tennis experience to the sport.
“I just knew I wanted to still be back in tennis, and I still had that desire, I still enjoyed the sport,” Blake shared with The Crimson.
The Miami Open, one of the nine coveted ATP Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 tournaments on the nearly year-round professional tour, wrapped up last week at Hard Rock Stadium. The coveted singles trophies were taken home by Daniil Medvedev and Petra Kvitova, culminating an exciting 12 days of play at the highest level of the sport. Blake became director of the Miami Open in 2018, making him the first Black tournament director on the ATP Tour.
Under Blake’s leadership, the tournament relocated to Hard Rock Stadium — home of the Miami Dolphins — and saw the construction of a state-of-the-art tennis facility. The move skyrocketed the event’s fan attendance, with a stunning 390,000 visitors in the first year at Hard Rock.
“The tournament director role has also been a wonderful fit because I feel like I can help the players,” Blake shared. “I come from, obviously, the playing background, so they know that they have a voice in the room, and it's the voice of a former player that knows what they're feeling, what they're sensing, and what makes the tournament good for them.”
At the same time, Blake has continued his work with charity and activism. In 2008, he founded the James Blake Foundation, which raises money for the Thomas Blake, Sr. Fund at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The foundation began as a one-time memorial to Blake’s father, combining music — Blake’s childhood friend John Mayer performed — and tennis. The events continued annually, and the foundation continues to raise money for cancer research. In the same year, Blake was awarded the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year Award.
In 2015, Blake became an “accidental activist,” after he was attacked by a New York City police officer while waiting outside his hotel in Manhattan. Blake wrote a book, Ways of Grace: Stories of Activism, Adversity, and How Sports Can Bring Us Together, in the aftermath of the attack which delves into his decision to use his platform to speak out on police brutality. The book dives into the lives and work of athletes throughout history who used their positions to speak out and create change.
“[The book] talks about being an accidental activist, because I didn't necessarily have a plan to be [an activist] until that happened when I realized I could have gone away and not done anything about it,” Blake said. “And as I thought about it, and reflected on it, instead of making a rash decision, I thought, well, you know, what if I had been James Blake the accountant, and that had happened to me? I wouldn't have had a voice, I wouldn’t have been able to make any difference. But I actually have the ability to speak to some people and to have this voice. And so I felt that that's my responsibility.”
Blake’s transition from athlete to philanthropist, activist, and tournament director was certainly a major change, but he has been a trailblazer throughout his entire career.
Before his selection as a wildcard for the 1999 US Open, the Harlem, N.Y., native was a standout player for the Crimson, placing him in the small subset of professionals who came from the college arena.
“College tennis was an unbelievable transition for me,” Blake shared with The Crimson. “It was really perfect because when I got to school, I was still 17 years old, about 150, 155 pounds, so I definitely needed to develop both physically and mentally to be at the level of the pros.”
In his two years at Harvard before committing to tennis full-time, Blake was a two-time All-American, playing alongside his older brother, Thomas. He was named the ITA National Player of the Year and won the ITA Rolex National Indoor Championship in 1999 to finish his college career. Blake credits his time at Harvard as critical for his development as a player.
“I really do remember so many of the matches I played [at Harvard]. I think it's partly because it inspires a feeling. The matches you play on tour are exciting and thrilling because of the fans, but there's so much more when there is that emotion attached to it,” Blake said. “That's where your memories I think are triggered. For me, so many matches in college tennis really sparked an emotion [in] me, whether it be so positive for winning a clinching match, or so negative when you feel like you let the team down.”
Blake won ten singles titles during his prolific career on the professional circuit before his retirement in 2013. His first title came in 2002 at the Citi Open in Washington, D.C., where he defeated the legendary Andre Agassi in the semifinals. He would go on to collect nine more singles titles, as well as a Davis Cup team championship. Yet Blake faced a number of challenges along the way — in 2004, he broke his neck while practicing and later lost his father to cancer. Despite that, he returned for his best season yet in 2006 and continued playing until 2013. He played his last professional singles match at the US Open, where he was a wildcard qualifier 14 years earlier.
“It was a pretty natural decision, my body was starting to fail, really. And also, I had one daughter already and another was on the way,” Blake said. “So it actually felt like a really perfect time to step away where I could be much more involved and help my wife and be a part of the family dynamic a lot more than I had been as a full active tour player.”
The realm of tennis has developed a lot in the ten years since, and Blake has had a front-row seat.
“It's been great to see that the tournament, the tour, the level just keeps getting better and better,” he shared.
What’s to thank for the continually improving quality of tennis, and making it possible for players to compete into their late 30s? Better training, more money, and technology.
“Everything they're doing for recovery is really, really extending careers, and making for better players,” said Blake, referencing the influx of technologies like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, Normatec boots, and intense physical therapy. “Late in tournaments, when you might see some players faltering a generation ago, where they played too many matches in a row, a player is able to recover so much better now.”
Blake’s unique experiences have given him the tools to expand his impact far beyond tennis and into activism and philanthropy. With his intimate knowledge of the sport and its business, his involvement in charitable causes and activist missions, and his new administrative role at one of pro tennis’ most important tournaments, he is well-positioned to play a major role in the sport’s future.

The time has come: Yardfest is approaching, rumors are circulating, and the Monday morning hangover is already calling your name (why is Yardfest on a Sunday again?!). Who is performing? Do you know? Does anyone know? Does the College Events Board even know? Well, while CEB frantically begs someone, anyone to perform by next Sunday, we’ll provide our guarantees predictions on who it will may be.
The Soundcloud Rapper from My High School
My dad once told me: “expectations lead to disappointment.” In light of his wisdom, we will begin by setting the bar as low as it could go: SoundCloud, high school, and teenage boys. Believe it or not, MattyBars from good-ole’ Ellicott City, Maryland might just pop out. With his 3k listens on SoundCloud and dropout-level ambition, MattyBars has officially made it to the big (Ivy) leagues. Matty if you are reading this, I was your fourth listener on SoundCloud. Remember me forever.
Future 
I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge CEB’s first clue: “🎭📅". The most convincing argument I have gathered thus far has been none other than Future himself. I mean come onnnn: Masks? Mask OFF?? July 17? A date that is in the FUTURE??? Now how about the second clue?: WALL-E? THE MOVIE THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE FUTURE??? This is very high-level thinking, I know. These guys forget we go to Harvard.
One Direction 
Yes, you read that right. The One Direction reunion IS happening AND it’s happening right in front of my freshman dorm. Girls will be screaming, guys will be crying, and Rakesh Khurana will be getting a very blurry selfie with each and every one of them (yes, including Zayn). This is the time to find out what makes you beautiful. This is the transformative experience a Harvard education provides. This is what ecstasy feels like.
Okay. Now wake up. Apart from your dreams, this would only happen in your wattpad fanfictions. I’m talking to you, y/n.
The Weeknd 
I am going to be honest and admit that this is ChatGPT’s guess and not mine. Here’s what it told me though!
Masks: The Weeknd is known for wearing masks at his concerts and performances.
July 17: The Weeknd’s debut album contains the lyric "July 17 will never be the same." (fact check: it does not.)
Wall-E (this one is actually crazy): “The Weeknd contributed a song titled "Earned It" to the soundtrack of the movie "Fifty Shades of Grey", which was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. Taylor-Johnson is married to Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who played the character of John in the movie "Nowhere Boy". The main character in "Nowhere Boy" is played by Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who also played the voice of the character of Ferb in the TV show "Phineas and Ferb". The voice of the character of WALL-E in the movie "WALL-E" was provided by Ben Burtt, who also provided the voice of Ferb's pet, Perry the Platypus, in "Phineas and Ferb". Therefore, the connection between "WALL-E" and The Weeknd is somewhat convoluted, but it can be traced back to his contribution to the "Fifty Shades of Grey" soundtrack.”
No Caller ID: I spent eight minutes arguing with AI for it to give me a viable relation between this clue and the Weeknd. Nothing. Literally nothing. If this is the future, I’m out. How could you possibly use this thing to write your EXPOS essays?
Taylor Swift
Call it optimism, call it delusion, I don’t care. Those two are synonymous anyway. BUT WHAT IF? What if Taylor Swift heard the cries of desperate Harvard students and wanted to atone for Ticketmaster’s crimes? What if she just loves the cold, damp mess that is Cambridge, Massachusetts? What if she wanted to add Remy to her cat collection? These are possibilities people. I will fully enter cardiac arrest if this happens. I am not joking. I will be sobbing to every song and meditating on this experience for the rest of my existence. No, I cannot remember a single formula from Ec 10B, but I will be able to recite every single syllable of the 10-minute All Too Well.
Please be aware that these are not predictions, but pure fact. If the headliner is not one of these artists, it’s because it WAS, and the College Events Board read THIS article, and CHANGED it. If all goes well, I’ll see you and MattyBars at Yardfest! <3

Boston’s Chinatown, located in downtown Boston, is just five train stops away from the Harvard campus along the Red Line. It is the only historic Asian enclave in New England, with history dating back to its construction in the 1800s followed by the earliest wave of Chinese immigration in the early 1890s.
To power us through the day, my roommate and I made our first stop at Bánh Mì Hương Quê, a Vietnamese sandwich shop located on Washington St. near Empire Garden Restaurant, a popular Dim Sum place in Chinatown.
A worker at the store prepares bánh mì while chatting with customers in Cantonese. When she took my order for a Vietnamese iced coffee, she smiled and asked if I also want a bánh mì for the day.
The store is famous for their Vietnamese baguette sandwich, bánh mì, which comes with your choice of protein along with pâté, house mayo, assorted pickled veggies, cilantro, and jalapeño all together in a crunchy baguette. The store’s best seller is the bánh mì thịt nướng — a grilled beef bánh mì. So I ordered it.
The worker told us in Vietnamese that she has been living in the U.S. for almost 30 years and can also speak fluent Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese.
Our next stop was Ding Ho Fast Food, a Chinese food restaurant joint that has been around since 1980. The cozy little restaurant is hidden away on the corner of Harrison Avenue.
The store usually has three main starch options: lo mein, mei fun, and fried rice. The two proteins that are served daily are curry chicken and soy sauce chicken. Besides these main dishes, Ding Ho also serves dumplings and various kinds of Chinese-style soups.
The store workers shared with us in Mandarin that they are immigrants from Guangdong and have worked at Ding Ho for one to two decades. The store is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.. However, they often start preparing the foods as early as at 6 a.m. in the morning.
In Mandarin, one of the two employees shared with us more about the long history of the store while preparing the next batch of food: vegetable stir fry.
Boston’s Chinatown is also known for its numerous bakery shops like Ho Yuen Bakery, located on Beach St. next to Gourmet Dumpling House.
Inside Great Taste Bakery & Restaurant, customers waited in line to order assortments of baked goods and pastries. The store functions both as a bakery and a typical Hong Kong-style restaurant, serving dim sum and other traditional dishes of rice noodles, hot pots, and sea foods.
Street vendors sell mangos, bananas, and dried foods on Beach Street. They remind my roommate, Kevin Liu ’23, of where he grew up in New York City's Chinatown.
We spoke to the owner of New Wing Wah Street Stall and learned that his family street market business has been in Chinatown for over a decade selling fresh fruits, vegetables, and Chinese New Year items.
The owner told us that he and his family often set up as early as 5 a.m. and the store often sells out at around 5 p.m.. Their street stall is known for its seafood items, the most popular of which are the dried scallop from Japan and China and oysters from China, Korea, and Japan.
