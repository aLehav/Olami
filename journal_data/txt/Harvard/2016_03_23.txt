After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
She’s beautiful—that’s undeniable. She makes me laugh. We joke maybe a little too often about having kids together, and next year we plan to adopt three fish named Chester, Alan, and Arthur after our excellently mustachioed 21st president.
Finding a BFF, as I might say if this were 2008 and I still called Taylor Swift “my favorite band,” has been one of the most grounding forces of my sophomore year. Having a person who will call you continuously when you’re falling apart, who will order Domino’s with you when you feel you can’t study anymore, who will sit talking with you in the dining hall long after it closes about everything from God to the middle names of presidents, is a beautiful thing.
To portray the oddity and intensity of female friendship is a daunting task, which is why much of our media chooses to take the easy way out. Cartoonist Alison Bechdel created the eponymous Bechdel Test, which asks of all works a simple question: whether two women in a piece of media talk to each other about something other than a man at any point. Too much of what we consume fails this test, reducing female characters to flat silhouettes that revolve around their male leads.
The obvious viewer counterweight to these wanting types of portrayal comes in the form of female friendships like the ones I’ve experienced in my own life: nuanced, complicated relationships that are given equal—if not greater—weight than romantic relationships. Women who can rely on each other and support one another through the darkest and most confusing moments in their respective lives. To portray this symbiosis is unquestionably difficult, but successful depictions provide a necessary look into the complex world of relationships between women.
It’s no wonder then that Abbi and Ilana of “Broad City” have become pop-cultural staples of our current climate. Occasionally set up as a dichotomy, these two function more as a continuously orbiting binary—irrevocably, inextricably tied to one another and constantly in each other’s orbit. They play off one another, Abbi keeping Ilana at least somewhat stable and Ilana pushing Abbi out of her comfort zone. Their existence is tandem, entangled, and somehow haphazardly beautiful.
For much of my life, I saw relationships with men as inherently imbued with a value impossible to achieve with people who weren’t men. I was always jealous of friends who said, “I just get along with guys better—there’s so much less drama.” This easy camaraderie with men seemed cool, interesting, and desirable throughout my middle school and high school years. And when I realized that I might like girls, I responded by convincing myself that I had to end up with a man, that it somehow meant more.
And then I started to consume media that was different. There was “Jessica Jones,” with its central relationship being a female friendship. There was “Gilmore Girls,” aptly titled given its focus on mother, daughter, and a constant cast of supportive friends. And of course we have Abbi and Ilana, the dynamic duo that’s dominating modern television.
Sometimes on rough afternoons, after trying weekends or stressful nights, my BFF and I will sit together in the basement of Lamont or on her bed and watch “Broad City.” Between us, there’s no clear Abbi, no clear Ilana. While we can’t be divided in terms of this iconic comedy dichotomy, the strength of the “Broad City” friendship, of the Abbi and Ilana entanglement, feels intimately familiar.
In the season finale of “Jessica Jones,” it is Trish, Jessica’s best friend, whom Jessica saves. Throughout the series, though, the roles seem to be reversed, with Trish constantly looking out for Jessica, supporting her through addiction and trauma and the survival of abuse. Through positive and negative relationships, this cycle of support is the backbone of the show. Comfort and consistency are the things of solid friendship, free of the pressures to look good, to put on a persona, to put out. Friendships can exist independent of expectations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Hers
The veins beneath her skin glowed blue beneath the MTA fluorescents, as if Time had frozen them in porcelain. He imagined pressing his lips to a Russian china doll or the Vatican floor. Peter grabbed her hand, wanting to tell her how he felt, that this trip to New York wasn’t just a platonic excursion, how he had never been so encapsulated by a woman. Delilah looked up and smiled like a child observing a strange painting. The subway doors opened, releasing the moment out into the March air.

His
Peter and Samson had kissed just once, drunk, on the shuttle back from the Quad one Saturday night freshman year. Both pulled away and laughed. But as the humor faded, the space between the two men fell away, replaced by a quiet heavy with meaning.

The Wrath of Angels
The ArchAngels had cast him out of Heaven, so Peter wandered in the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Gabriel had cast the first stone. It hit the surface and rippled throughout the roommates.  Peter returned from section and opened his door to a common room he barely recognized. The angels had stripped away every hint of habitation aside from his own. Their coats were gone from their hangers. They’d taken their mugs from the shelf. The calendar had been torn off the wall. Their bedroom doors were closed, locked. Peter had never known such a violent silence.
He could hear them on the other side of the wall. Delilah was crying. Samson kept saying, “Time.” Peter stopped listening when they started having sex.

First Night
Peter ran into Michael in the bathroom, running sink water over his righteous sword. Peter asked if they could talk. “I think that time’s passed,” Michael said, and nothing else. Peter watched his own blood stream off the blade and down the drain.
Noah: I can’t.
Peter: Please, just for tonight. We could cuddle?
Noah: I have a pset due tomorrow. Plus I have to work on this fucking arc.
Peter: Please, I can’t be in my room.
Noah: This is really unfair of you to ask me. You know I have a lot of work. Gnight.
Peter slept with the lights on, hoping the silence wouldn’t get to him.

Theirs
“But where are you going?” Peter demanded. Samson and Delilah had their hands in the other’s pockets.
“We built a shelter where the angels’ quiet can’t get at us,” one said.
“Yes, but there’s only room for you two.”
“It’s okay, Peter. We don’t need protection anymore. We built this ourselves,” the other assured.
“What about me?” But they’d already retreated into their shelter. Delilah was fussing over Samson’s new haircut.

Abnormal
Abnormal was every Tuesday and Thursday like clockwork. The prof was predictably 40 minutes late. Noah sent Peter doves across lecture over the Cloud—little electronic olive branches. He could come over tonight if he wanted.
Abnormal meant studying certain subjects from which Peter continuously distanced himself. The theory had been gently suggested, and he admitted to a slight suspicion but never allowed those thoughts to become fully formed in his mind. To permit them space within his brain meant partially admitting to their truth. Over all else, he was most terrified of being unoriginal. A right-brain bisexual with mild to severe depression: It’s been done. Truth was so easily twisted and tucked away, like history and statistics.

Ours
Peter had a drawer in Noah’s wardrobe. He couldn’t really remember how it had gotten there, like a strange bruise one finds on his arm one day. He couldn’t recall the last time he’d slept in his own bed. Time ticked by but lost all logic in Noah’s presence.

LamCaf
“I saw your roommate here yesterday!” Liz sang, handing Peter his chai.
“ArchAngel?”
“No, from last year! Other Noah!” Peter hadn’t thought of Other Noah in months. A storm flashed through his mind.

Another Sky
They’d gone to dinner and now they were seated side by side, waiting for the show to begin. This date, five months after their first, had been Noah’s idea. It was Peter’s idea to buy tickets for Saturday so he wouldn’t have to bump into the ArchAngels. Gabriel was the lead, so Peter supposed he’d congratulate him afterwards. He hadn’t spoken to them for nearly a month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to believe that open discourse was a value all Americans hold dear. I presumed that when asked about what makes America so unique, many Americans would respond that our pluralistic society is the foundation of so much of our success. That it was understood that without a marketplace of ideas, our society simply could not flourish.
But then I started college.
Since the beginning of my freshman year, I have come to believe that a more fitting way to describe the current culture on college campuses is a culture defined not by open expression—but by sensitivity. This undue focus on feelings has caused the college campus to often feel like a place where one has to monitor every syllable that is uttered to ensure that it could not under any circumstance offend anyone to the slightest degree. It sometimes feels as though pluralism has become an antiquated concept. Facts and history have been discarded, and instead feelings have been deemed to be the criteria that determine whether words and actions are acceptable.
It is important to have organizations and movements on college campuses that work toward protecting individuals’ identities. The past few decades have witnessed an explosion of new identities, and students should become aware of and respect the plethora of new identities that have recently emerged. But many of these movements have gone too far.
Take the University of New Hampshire’s “Bias-Free Language Guide.” The list was compiled to inform students of words that are considered offensive in conversation. According to the guide, which was removed from the school’s website a few months ago after it incited controversy, the word “American” is unacceptable, for it fails to recognize people of South American origin. “American,” it argues, should be replaced with “resident of the U.S.” The words “senior citizens,” “older people,” and “elders” should also be eliminated, and instead replaced with “people of advanced age” and “old people.” If we’re at a point where it is offensive to say that your 90-year-old grandparent is a senior citizen, it seems that pretty soon, there may not be any neutral words left.
While some may argue that these language guides are merely suggestions largely ignored by students and administrators, they have in fact become the new reality. Over the past few weeks, Bowdoin College has witnessed an alarming shutdown of freedom of expression. A few weeks ago, students hosted a tequila-themed birthday party that featured guests donning mini-sombreros, and the administration subsequently decided to seriously investigate an "act of ethnic stereotyping.” The invitation to the party, sent by a student of Colombian descent, read: “the theme is tequila, so do with that what you may. We’re not saying it’s a fiesta, but we’re also not not saying that :).” The students who hosted the party were put on social probation (which appears on one’s permanent record) and were kicked out of their dorms. Two student government representatives who attended the party faced impeachment charges, and other students who were present at the event or were photographed wearing sombreros have also been subject to disciplinary action.
The unfolding of events is especially outrageous given that a few months earlier, Bowdoin hosted on-campus reunions that featured photo booths and props including mustaches and sombreros. Furthermore, the annual administration-approved Cold War party occurred on the same night as the tequila one, and guests showed up dressed as Soviets—wearing fur hats and coats. Just a week later, the dining hall hosted Mexican night. Nonetheless, the tequila party was the only one deemed cultural appropriation.
The rise of safe spaces has also deeply encroached upon open dialogue and free expression. It is ironic that while the origins of the term safe space can be found in the 20th century women’s movement, where it "implies a certain license to speak and act freely,” today the term has come to be associated with precisely the opposite: the inability to speak freely. Journalists have been silenced in the name of safe spaces and debates have been barred. Books have been banned and conversation topics prohibited.
In a class I attended earlier this semester, a large portion of the first meeting was devoted to compiling a list of rules for class discussion. A student contended that as a woman, she would be unable to sit across from a student who declared that he was strongly against abortion, and the other students in the seminar vigorously defended this declaration. The professor remained silent. In a recent conversation with peers, I posed a question about a verse from the Bible. A Harvard employee in the room immediately interjected, informing me that we were in a safe space and I was thus not permitted to discuss the controversial biblical passage. And these are just stories from the past three months.
The assaults on free expression have dire consequences. The rise of the microagression movement has been reported to be detrimental to mental health on campus. Students’ emotional distress is increasing as educators presume that fragile undergraduates need to be protected from any form of dissent. Administrators must recognize that the current restrictions are incompatible with the very premise and goal of an education.
It is time to stop focusing on feelings as the criteria for speech and actions on the college campus.

“Que triste es el olvido antes que el hueco de una tumba se abra... No me dejes morir, que no he vivido.”
(How tragic is to be forgotten before one’s tomb is opened… Don’t let me die, for I have not lived.)
­­­—Manuel Álvarez Magaña, renowned Salvadorian poet
Every so often, someone tries to kill my uncle. From the idiot who tried robbing his bus with a hand grenade to the young man who shot up his car, my uncle’s had his share of rough days in El Salvador. By this point, attempts on his life have become part of a greater Magaña family tradition of continuous close calls with death, a tradition I hope doesn’t foreshadow my future with the Army. The death squads hunted my mother, the nationalists tried to forcibly conscript my uncle, and the guerrillas killed their friends. It seems that El Salvador and suffering tend to come hand in hand.
In the early 2000s, El Salvador’s future didn’t look like its abysmal past. In March 2012, the government brokered a controversial truce between MS-13 and Barrio 18, El Salvador’s two largest gangs. To the surprise of many, the gangs’ respective leaders honored the truce, leading to the country’s largest reduction in homicides. Unfortunately, the peace was short-lived. In February 2013, El Salvador’s government transferred leaders from Barrio 18 and MS-13 to a maximum-security prison in Zacatecoluca, hoping to cripple the gangs’ ability to organize. Ironically, the move worked, but with devastating consequences.
With their chain of command compromised, the gangs’ leaders were unable to enforce the truce. To make matters worse, in the absence of communication between leaders, neither gang knew if the other intended to preserve the peace. Left to their own devices, members of each gang deferred to their natural instructions: Eliminate the opposition.
By mid-2013, the truce between MS-13 and Barrio 18 was non-existent, along with any hope of an El Salvador worth living in. By the end of 2013, El Salvador found itself drowning in blood once more. The government’s reaction? Initiate a wave of extra-judicial killings. El Salvador’s police and military forces once more formed death squads to hunt suspects. In a twist of irony fitting for El Salvador’s tragic history, the leftist Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front government now uses the very same tactics the nationalists and CIA employed to hunt FMLN party members in the 80s to now promote “security.”
Through the gangs, the poor kill the poor, but with the aid of repressive government operations, an incompetent government now kills its impoverished people so that they may protect the poor from themselves.
Understandably, El Salvador is seeing its greatest exodus since the height of its civil war. In 2014, thousands of unaccompanied migrant children found themselves in legal limbo as Congress played politics with their lives.
In December 2014, the U.S. State Department opened a program intended to allow minors from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to apply from their homes for refugee status in the U.S., thereby circumventing the hellish trek through Mexico. Since November 2015, more than 5,100 Salvadorians applied, of which only 16 were approved.
This past January, I had the pleasure of working at the border with a friend. Unsurprisingly, we encountered numerous migrants fleeing Central America’s violence. In the bathroom of an empty church, we met a worker who had already been deported twice. When asked why he kept returning despite the deportations, he answered that, as long as he’s on the run, the gangs can’t kill him.
When conservatives speak of a wall or tougher migration policies, I’m shocked by their ignorance. El Salvador is now the world’s murder capital; do they think tougher immigration measures will frighten away migrants who’ve seen some of the world’s worst violence? Then again, when my liberal friends speak of reforming migration policy and amnesty, I’m also dumbfounded. Neither approach addresses the root cause behind El Salvador’s exodus: violence.
Deport more people, and you’ll strengthen the gangs; after all, deportations are what transferred MS-13 from the streets of LA to the slums of El Salvador. Liberalize immigration policy, and you’ll only condemn El Salvador to another decade of labor shortages and brain drain as hundreds of thousands of Salvadorians understandably seek better lives elsewhere. The solution? Help make El Salvador a country worth living in.
Unfortunately, the solutions that eradicate violence effectively tend to make for poor campaign slogans. Thus, as long as politicians oversimplify the immigration debate into a battle between amnesty and mass deportations, the root cause of the Central American exodus will remain unresolved.
My mom always fears for her family in El Salvador. Every phone call with her mother, every Skype session with her sister, every visit from her brother could be their last. People she loves—people I love—are in constant danger of getting killed. But then again, there’s nothing special about that. Death’s the Salvadorian way, right?
El Salvador bled yesterday, El Salvador bleeds today, and El Salvador will bleed tomorrow. Likewise, few cared yesterday, few care today, and even fewer will care tomorrow unless we substitute change for rhetoric.
Until then, the world will continue to ignore Salvadorian screams.

Shortly before spring break, Currier House produced a Housing Day video in which a Trump impersonator travels from house to house, criticizing each in the style of the real estate developer’s bombastic insults, before eventually praising Currier. Shortly before Housing Day, the video—which had previously been approved by the House’s Faculty Deans and tutors—was taken down.
One does not need to be a fan of Donald Trump to recognize that he is no longer a fringe character. While Trump’s meteoric political rise is disturbing, it also makes him a valid target for satire. In light of this reality, Currier House’s recent decision to take down a Housing Day video featuring the businessman and Republican presidential front-runner was wrong.
With the exception of passing references to campus liberalism and Ted Cruz, the video is entirely apolitical. It does not purport to promote, endorse, or sanction Donald Trump, his policies, or his rhetoric. Even had the video been more politically charged, it still would not be Currier’s place to decide what topics are valid objects of political satire. Such a view would find us on an uncomfortable and slippery slope down the dark road of administrative censorship.
After all, this video was created by Currier’s House Committee, the body that supposedly represents the residents of the House. If the video needed to be taken down, it should only have been done after extensive dialogue with students. Though productive dialogue did occur at a town hall meeting after the video was taken down, the House should have conducted a longer and more thorough process of consultation before reaching a final decision.
Some Currier residents, especially Latino, undocumented, and Muslim students, may very well have  felt uncomfortable with satirizing Trump, given his bigoted and racist views. But opposition to his poisonous rhetoric is precisely why it deserves satire. Indeed, all political satire inevitably touches on difficult topics.
Other apolitical Housing Day videos could be similarly construed as offensive. Numerous videos describe gratuitous sex, drinking, or drug consumption or, more appropriately, they parody songs that do. By the standards of Currier House, these videos should be taken down as well.
The brutal reality is that Donald Trump is leading the race for the Republican nomination. As of now, he has amassed nearly 50 percent of all GOP delegates awarded thus far. He is the subject of constant political discussion, newspaper headlines, and cable news coverage. He is certainly a reasonable target for satire.
More fundamentally, Housing Day videos are not house mascots. They are not comparable to shields, crests, or namesakes. They do not represent a House, nor do they embody it. They are one-time, passing, light-hearted, student-created, and unofficial ways to celebrate Housing Day. When they satirize the Republican presidential frontrunner—hardly a road less traveled—let’s not blow it out of proportion. Let’s not censor it either.

A new spring break meal plan has received mixed reviews from students who stayed on campus over the weeklong holiday.
The meal plan—which Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana detailed in February—offered students with “high financial aid” a $225 stipend to buy food in and around Harvard Square instead of eating in the dining halls, which were closed from March 11 to March 19. The allotment amounted to a daily stipend of about $25.

For many, the stipend was a welcome relief. Allison M. Rabe ’19, said she was pleasantly surprised when she heard news of the program, and “jumped at the opportunity.”
Students who qualified for the stipend received an email from Khurana in late February inviting them to apply. Those interested were required to submit an application, which asked for information regarding their financial aid status and whether they would be on campus over the break, according to Tynan G. Jackson ’19, a student who applied for the stipend.
Both Rabe and Jackson said they were happy with the amount of funds given, and did not use all of the money they received. Jackson added that over the break, the College and various student groups hosted numerous events that handed out free food.
“I think the stipend overall improved my spring break experience,” Jackson said.Yet, for those who did not receive funding, staying on campus during spring break proved to be a different experience.
“I didn’t expect the dining halls to be closed; it was really short notice, so I didn’t know I would need funding,” said Elsie A. Tellier ’19, a student who applied but did not receive funding.
Rationing food and creating a tight budget helped some other students staying on campus for spring break. To save money, Tellier and her blockmate also went to grocery stores to pick up cheap food that they knew would last for the week. When the dining halls closed on the Friday before break, many students scrambled to take as much food as they could, she said.

In a speech at the 2016 Harvard World Model United Nations in Rome last Thursday, Pope Francis urged international unity as a remedy for the ills of the modern world.
“The issues and challenges you discuss are not faceless,” the Pope said through a translator. “Behind every difficulty our world is facing, there are men and women, young and old, people just like you.”
The conference gathered approximately 2,400 delegates, who hailed from some 110 different countries, according to Joseph P. Hall ’16, the Secretary-General of Harvard WorldMUN.
Addressing the delegates, many of whom were waving their respective national flags, the Pope said, “I am especially pleased to know that your members represent so many nations and cultures and, therefore, reflect the rich diversity of our human family.”
The greatest benefit of delegates’ time in Rome, the Pope continued, did not have to do with learning about diplomacy, international systems or organizations, but rather their time together and their encounters with people from around the world.
WorldMUN organizers said they were inspired by the pontiff’s message.
“I think the papacy is a tremendously important figure in international relations no matter what era it is,” Hall said, “and I think this Pope in particular has taken on a message that resonates with our generation very well because he’s got a message of inclusion, of service, and of equality.”
Rajkumar S. Pammal ’17, another member of the WorldMUN team, called the experience surreal.
“As the Pope walked down the aisle from the back of the auditorium to the elevated stage where he took his seat in between two cardinals, every member of the audience was truly captivated,” Pammal said.
Many delegates, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the organization of the conference. For a number of delegates, the Pope’s message of international unity was overshadowed by more immediate concerns about the conference’s logistics. Through the Harvard WorldMUN’s Facebook page, many participants raised concerns with the price of the conference, the availability of amenities, and the organization of the leadership.
Sam R. Povey, a student at the London School of Economics and Political Science, for instance, criticized on Facebook what he called “the lack of experienced chairs, actual chairs, tables, buses, and pages.”
The organizers of Harvard WorldMUN responded by echoing the Pope’s message of international unity and cooperation.
In a letter to delegates posted on its Facebook page, Hall and the WorldMUN organizing committee urged attendees to focus on the positive aspects of their experience.
“As we all know from Model UN,” the letter read, “being angry about problems without helping to create solutions is not constructive.”

Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung plans to seek higher office in the Massachusetts Senate, the upper body of the Commonwealth’s legislature.
Cheung, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate, collected the 500 signatures needed to get his name on the ballot for September’s Democratic primary to represent the Second Middlesex District in the Senate. He will campaign against incumbent Democrat Patricia D. Jehlen, a long-term state legislator who has represented the district, which includes Cambridge, Somerville, and other towns, since 2005.
 After several terms on the City Council, Cheung, who announced his campaign last week, said he began to see a divide between the local and state levels of government.
“I realized that a lot of the work that I’ve been doing on the council, you really need to take action with state leadership to make significant change and really improve the lives of residents,” Cheung said.
The councillor said his priorities for this year’s campaign include “investment in education, in transportation, in infrastructure and in each other.”
No stranger to campaigning, Cheung successfully ran for several different offices since the start of his political career in 2009. Most recently, Cheung won reelection to the Council as part of the “Unity Slate” of seven incumbents.
“I first ran in office in 2009, while I was still in the Kennedy school. But now, I’ve ran five times. Five or six, I’ve lost count,” Cheung said.
From his time at the Kennedy School, Cheung said he learned campaigning techniques, using a lot of data that is uncommon for local races. He continues to use his contacts at HKS, like lecturer Linda Bilmes, who advises him on policy for the Cambridge City Council.
Henry S. U. Shah ’17, a former Crimson magazine editor, said he was attracted to Cheung’s “21st century campaigning techniques” when he volunteered on Cheung’s 2013 City Council campaign during his freshman year.
“What first excited me and still excites me is his ability to run a local campaign and run a really local form of governance where he walks door by door,” Shah said. “But he also connects with everything that the web, Facebook, and Twitter [have] to offer with transparency and accountability.”
In 2013, Shah penned a Crimson op-ed showing his support for Cheung as the “students’ voice” on the Council. Today, Shah works for the Entrepreneurship Walk of Fame, a Kendall Square organization that Cheung runs.
Cheung’s most ambitious campaign yet was his 2014 run for Lieutenant Governor. He entered the race late, hoping to bridge the divide between state and local legislators, Cheung said. Cheung’s hopes ended when he finished second in the Democratic primary that year.
“It was really heartening to get all the support I got from across the state. We got in the race late to try and raise awareness of the importance of cities and towns’ needs,” Cheung said. “I don’t think I would do it again though, too much time away from home.”
Cheung hopes to bring lasting reforms in the State Senate and then eventually leave electoral politics for good.
“I don’t have any plans to become a career politician. At some point I’d like to go back to having a job that allows me to go home at five o’clock at night,” Cheung said.

Beginning this week, a new startup will enable students to send feedback to their Undergraduate Council representatives via text message.
The startup, named Feedback Hotline, provides a phone number that students can text to send anonymous feedback to their UC representatives or the UC President and Vice President, depending on a three-character code included in the text message.
The same phone number can also be used to send feedback to businesses, several of which are located in Harvard Square and Porter Square. Feedback Hotline is operating or preparing to operate in 105 locations, including Pinkberry’s Harvard Square location, according to Akshar Bonu ’17, one of the co-founders of the startup.
“I really like it,” Bryan Ruiz, a manager at Pinkberry, said.  “When customers have a complaint, they send us a message about it and we can help fix it.”
Customers visiting the restaurants can use place cards on tables with the number of the feedback hotline as well as the three-character code to provide feedback.  The restaurant then receives emails with the feedback attached.
Pinkberry gets about two messages a day from customers through Feedback Hotline, according to Ruiz.
Mike’s Pastry and Chutney’s in Harvard Square are currently in talks with Feedback Hotline about setting up programs for their stores.
Bonu said he came up with the idea when he visited his hometown in the Philippines, and found it difficult to provide feedback to local businesses he visited.
“It was very hard or unclear how to send feedback to them,” Bonu said. “It’s very complicated.”
With Feedback Hotline, Bonu hopes to make the process of providing feedback to businesses and organizations easier and more consistent.
“It’s one number you can text to send feedback to anyone,” Bonu said. “The feedback is often actionable, and that’s what businesses really appreciate. They want to go out and improve.”
Bo Seo ’17, who co-founded Feedback Hotline along with Bonu and University of Texas student Claudio M. Wilson, said he worked on Feedback Hotline’s partnership with the UC in order to make it easier for students to communicate with their elected representatives.
“For any strategic objective a student government like the UC might have, you need effective communication between that student government and the student body it seeks to represent,” Seo said.
The UC formally established the partnership during the UC’s general meeting on March 6, when the Council voted unanimously to grant Feedback Hotline $488 under the UC’s Grant for an Open Harvard College.
“We’ve been really lucky to have a UC that’s been very receptive to hearing new ideas and to implement such plans so quickly,” Seo said.
In addition to providing feedback to the UC, Feedback Hotline also has plans to expand to other student organizations on campus.
Eventually, Feedback Hotline also hopes to coordinate with college administrative offices such as the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to allow students to more easily provide feedback to administrators as well.
“These offices already try to solicit feedback in other ways,” Seo said. “We think ours is an easier alternative.”
In the future, Feedback Hotline intends to allow feedback via other channels, including a dedicated mobile app and a Facebook Messenger presence. The startup is also working on a mechanism to allow places that have received feedback to respond to it, according to Bonu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard student groups urged University President Drew G. Faust to join their coalition aimed at improving campus dining service employees’ labor contract, presenting her with a letter Tuesday outlining what they consider problems with the agreement.
The letter comes ahead of a round of negotiations between Harvard and its dining services workers set for late spring. The issues on the table include health care and fair labor wages—two points emphasized during recent negotiations between Harvard and its largest employee union. The letter also calls for year-round employment opportunities for dining, security, and janitorial workers.
Gabe G. Hodgkin ’18  and Grace F. Evans ’19—members of the Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate organization that has previously hosted events with various Harvard unions—spoke briefly with Faust during her office hours at the Science Center to present the letter. When Faust left the meeting, she encountered a group of about 20 SLAM members, Harvard workers, and union affiliates who were there to support Hodgkin and Evans.
Faust said Harvard is committed to reaching a favorable settlement in the upcoming negotiations that address the “needs of the union and the needs of the University.”
Representatives from organizations across the University—including Reclaim Harvard Law, the College Democrats, and the Graduate student unionization effort—signed the letter and accompanied SLAM when they presented it to Faust. These groups have formed what they describe as a “coalition” that currently supports HUDS workers as they prepare to negotiate their contracts.
A chief concern in the impending negotiations is the topic of health care—an issue that has been controversial at Harvard, most recently in the wake of a health care benefits package that the University extended to its non-union employees. The letter argues that any contract that does not include affordable health care is directly in opposition to “principles of equity and justice” that Harvard embodies.
In fall 2014, Harvard introduced a controversial new health benefits package for its non-union employees, which many professors criticized for its deductibles and coinsurance payments that they argued would burden junior faculty and faculty with families. In August 2015, in response to criticism and discussions with those affected by the plan, Harvard offered an additional plan without deductibles or coinsurance, among other changes.
Specifically referencing the recent mumps outbreak across Harvard, the letter states that “when any member of our community is sick, everyone’s health is at risk.”
This letter is the latest in students’ efforts to change the contract. In February, SLAM hosted an event in Adams House for HUDS workers, drawing a crowd so large that attendees had to cycle in and out of the room to ensure that everyone could hear from the workers.
Edward B. Childs, a HUDS employee stationed at Adams House who said he has been affiliated with Harvard for about 40 years, expressed gratitude for SLAM members’ efforts.
“We really feel powerful now that the custodians are here with us, that the guards are here with us,” Childs said, referencing other workers who are now part of the coalition.

Thirteen Harvard alumni have joined a group of 710 plaintiffs in a privacy lawsuit against Google, alleging that the company had been intercepting their e-mail content through the Google Apps for Education platform from 2011 to 2014.
In the complaint filed last week, the plaintiffs claim that Google violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act by scanning e-mail content for the company’s own commercial purposes and without the consent of the faculty, students, and staff that use the google education platform.
Ray E. Gallo, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, said Google can intercept content for purposes that are “ordinary and customary in the course of providing email service” under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, although that provision does not necessarily include scanning for advertisements.
“It’s not an essential part of providing email services,” he said.
Many institutions that use the Google Apps for Education suite, including Harvard, signed contracts with Google that prohibit the company from intercepting content for marketing purposes, according to Gallo. These agreements were often made known to users upon adoption of the Google Apps for Education platform.
The complaint cites an archived FAQ section of Harvard University Information Technology’s website from 2013, which explicitly states that Google “will not use user data for purposes other than maintaining the Google Apps for Harvard service.”
According to Gallo, an April 2014 statement from Google implies that the company had been violating its contracts with universities until April 2014. The company announced then that it had “permanently removed all ads scanning” from the Google Apps for Education platform in April 2014.
Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, plaintiffs could receive $10,000 in statutory damages from this case.
This case is one of several e-mail privacy lawsuits filed against Google. Chris J. Hoofnagle, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in internet and information privacy law, said that this case differs from many similar class-action lawsuits.
He describes the case as a “mass joinder” lawsuit, which means that all 710 plaintiffs chose to become involved in the case, rather than involuntarily being included in a class of plaintiffs.
“It’s a much more powerful posture,” Hoofnagle said.
Hoofnagle described the lawsuit as a procedural “nightmare” for Google because of the sheer number of plaintiffs.
“In a normal suit, you depose all of the plaintiffs. Class action, you depose some representative plaintiffs. But presumably in this case, Google would depose all [710],” he said.
Stephen J. Morrison ’15, one of the 13 Harvard plaintiffs in the case, said he “ironically” found out about the lawsuit because of a targeted ad online, and became concerned about the greater consequences of Google’s alleged privacy violation. He then joined the class of plaintiffs.
“I intend to do everything in my power to discourage… the emergence of a global marketplace for personal information, which has far-reaching and disturbing implications,” he said.
Gallo said that the defendant has yet to respond to the complaint.

Over a hundred students from several Harvard schools traveled to Cuba for spring break as the Obama administration eases regulations on visiting the island.
During the week-long trip, students visited Havana and Varadero as part of a travel program licensed by the US government called Cuba Candela.  Business School student Chad Olin founded the company last year.
Students said they were excited about traveling to Cuba at a unique time when dynamic changes are taking place between the country and the United States.
“I realized that Cuba will never be what it it’s like now because of the changing diplomatic relations and I thought this would be my only opportunity to see it for what it is now,” Claire V. Worley ’17 said.
A week ago, while the students were touring Cuba, the Obama administration announced a loosening of restrictions on traveling to the island. This marks the first time in decades that US citizens can travel there without permission from the government.
“The idea of experiencing a country that has been off limits for so long together has been exciting,” Maggie S. McNamara ’17 said.
Students found that their experiences on the island gave them a different perspective that enabled a better understanding of course material that focused on Cuba.
“I’m in a class right now where we’ve literally spent a month comparing a capitalist economy to a socialist one. To go to Cuba and see one in practice was a whole different experience than just talking about it,” McNamara said.
Similarly, Aleeza H. Hashmi ’16 described the experience as “eye-opening.”
“I think it’s very easy to put others in their box and say what we’re doing is right and what they’re doing is wrong versus being able to fully appreciate why these types of systems exist in the first place,” Hashmi said.
Trip participants said they expect more Americans to visit the island in coming years as the White House continues to loosen travel restrictions. According to the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, the number of Harvard students traveling to Cuba to study has nearly doubled from the previous fall, indicating a rise in student interest.
Olin said he hopes to bring more young people to Cuba from across the United States in order to expose them to a country that has been closed to the United States for much of recent history.
“It’s the vibrancy of the Cuban culture that manifests itself in many ways,” Olin said. “It’s the music on the street, walking down the street you’ll hear reggaeton coming from five different places.”

Author Michael A. Gould-Wartofsky ’07 discussed on Tuesday evening the Occupy movements of 2011, and its influence on social movements.
Speaking at the Kennedy School to an audience of students, staff, and local residents, Gould-Wartofsky reflected on his own experience participating in and writing about the movement, saying he believes the “moment” changed the way Americans perceive issues of class, race, and inequality.
“Occupy was not a social movement, but rather a point of unity between multiple social movements with distinct issues and interests,” Gould-Wartofsky said.
Gould-Wartofsky gave an overview of Occupy’s history and significance, applying lessons of its influence to more recent social movements, such as Black Lives Matter and Fight for $15, a campaign for a higher minimum wage. According to Gould-Wartofsky, the recent revival of income inequality in public and political discourse can be attributed to the legacy of Occupy.
“The ‘one percent’ was a language that could bring class politics back into mainstream discourse without alienating American publics in the process,” Gould-Wartofsky said, referencing Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign as an example.
Gould-Wartofsky argued that the influence of Occupy translated far beyond electoral politics.
“This is going to be more than one election cycle, and this is going to have more than a diffuse impact on the individual preferences expressed on secret ballots in periodic elections,” Gould-Wartofsky said.
He also drew upon his own experience with activism as an undergraduate at Harvard.
“Before 2011, we very much saw ourselves as a militant minority, who were fighting the good fight with some of our allies, employees and workers on this campus, very much in minority spheres, and almost accepting and embracing that role,” he said.
Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, who moderated the discussion, emphasized the role that campus activism, at Harvard and elsewhere, can play in changing views on inequality.
Referring to Harvard closure of the gates of Harvard Yard during the Occupy Harvard movement, McCarthy said he has never seen the University react in the way it did then.
“There was something about Occupy Harvard, a little piece of this Occupy moment, that was so threatening to the institution, that it literally excluded its members,” he said.
Edward B. Childs, a chef in Adams House, attended the discussion because of his interest in Occupy’s significance. Childs is also a chief steward of the Harvard dining hall workers in the Local 26 union of hospitality workers.

When Harvard rolled out a new policy defining sexual harassment in September 2014, it took a largely unprecedented step. For the first time, the University defined sexual harassment the same way at each of Harvard’s schools, replacing definitions that were, in some cases, as many as 20 years old.
A new office—the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution—began investigating formal complaints from each of Harvard’s schools and enforcing the newly centralized policy. But for students, faculty, or staff who filed complaints about conduct that occurred before September 2014—when the new policy went into effect— the investigative office uses the previous, school-specific policies to define sexual harassment and sexual assault.
“ODR applies the School or unit policy that was in effect when the incident occurred but uses the procedures that are currently in effect,” Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX officer, wrote in an email. “The policy in effect at the time the alleged incident occurred is the one the Respondent was on notice of.”
Since it opened in September 2014, ODR has received 34 formal complaints, 13 of which  investigated conduct that occurred before September 2014, according to Karvonides. In an email Tuesday, Karvonides declined to detail how many of those cases ODR investigated using old policies, writing that such data would require “complex analysis of case files.”
Karvonides added that the different policy standards have not affected the results of any investigations.
“We have not had an outcome that would be different under an old school-level policy versus the new policy,” Karvonides wrote Tuesday.
Harvard currently defines sexual harassment, a term that includes sexual assault, as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” that “is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it interferes with or limits a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s education or work programs or activities.”
Previously, each of Harvard’s schools could craft their own policies defining sexual assault. The previous Faculty of Arts and Sciences policy, adopted in 1993, provided definitions for sexual misconduct that included the categories of rape, indecent assault and battery, and “persistent unwanted sexual contact or conduct.”
The FAS policy defined rape as “any act of sexual intercourse that takes place against a person’s will or that is accompanied by physical coercion or the threat of bodily injury.” Before September 2014, the College’s Administrative Board, rather than a central office,  investigated complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault between students at the College.
Harvard overhauled its sexual assault policies and procedures in 2014. That April, the Department of Education launched an investigation into Harvard’s compliance with Title IX, and a few months later, in July 2014, Harvard unveiled its new policy and procedures that more closely conformed with federal guidelines.
Although the new policy is in effect, students can only be held liable for school policies that existed when the conduct occurred, a practice that is common when federal legislation changes.
Still, Jessica R. Fournier ’17, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student activist group that focuses on Title IX compliance and sexual assault prevention, said the continued application of the old policies is troubling.
“That old policy that Harvard says is in the past is still being implemented in some cases, and I don’t think that’s something that students know,” Fournier said. “I certainly don’t think it’s something that they tell students, and I think students should know about that.”
A federal investigation into the College’s Title IX compliance remains ongoing.

One individual died and another remains hospitalized with serious injuries after a shooting near Mt. Auburn Hospital late Tuesday night, according to Meghan Kelly, Communications Director of the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office.
Armando Hernandez, Jr., 30 of Belmont, was transported to Mt. Auburn Hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to Kelly. The other victim, an adult male, remains in a Boston hospital with serious injuries as of late Wednesday morning.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email at 11:30 p.m. Tuesday that immediately after the incident occurred by the 300th block of Mt. Auburn Street, two male victims had been sent to nearby hospitals with serious injuries. The investigation is ongoing, and officials have not released information about a suspect.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Warnick said an arrest has yet to be made.
"Cambridge Police believe this is a targeted incident and that there is no threat to the public’s safety," he wrote in an email.
Harvard University Police Department alerted students to avoid the area, which is located about a mile from Harvard Square. HUPD sent their alert at about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday.
Michael L. O’Connell, Vice President of Mt. Auburn Hospital, said that late Tuesday night the hospital operated as it would any other night. The building was secured and the emergency department was still open, O’Connell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just hours after a bombing attack in Brussels that killed at least 30 people, five faculty members spoke about Harvard’s role in addressing global crises—terror-related and otherwise—on Tuesday evening.
Several dozen people attended the event, the seventh annual installation of the “Harvard Thinks Big” speaker series hosted by the College Events Board, which focused on five issues: educational inequality, income inequality, race relations, terrorism, and climate change.
“At the end of the day, it’s our job to do our part to make the world a better place,” Timothy A. Makalinao ’18, who was master of ceremonies for the event, said to the audience at Sanders Theatre .
The CEB chose crisis as its topic because of its relevance to current affairs and its broad applicability to a range of disciplines, according to Harvard Thinks Big co-chair Caleb Spiegel Ostrom ’18.
“We thought it was something that feels very pressing, something that we could build a diverse and interesting event around,” Spiegel Ostrom said of the topic. “It allowed us to bring in professors from a broad range of subjects and fields.”
The faculty members who each spoke for 15 minutes each were Katherine K. Merseth, a senior lecturer on Education; Jennifer L. Hochschild, a Government professor; Brandon M. Terry, a professor of African and African American Studies; Ron Schouten, a Psychiatry professor at the Medical School; and Daniel P. Schrag, a professor of Environmental Science and Engineering.
“I’m leaning a little bit on Harvard students to consider an obligation to make the world a better place,” Merseth, who spoke about education inequality, said in an interview before the event. “I’m very much eager for education to become a topic of greater interest at Harvard College for students.”
In her talk, Merseth emphasized the importance of education in improving the standard of living worldwide.
“I think the education of children and youth is the most important issue that we face today in our society and in our world,” she said. “Consider how you could help ensure a high-quality education for all children.”
Schouten, who briefly made reference to the attacks in Brussels in his remarks, questioned whether all terrorist attacks could be considered acts born out of mental illness.
“After each of the horrific events that are far too numerous, far too depressing to list, people declared that anyone who would do that must be sick, must be crazy,” Schouten said. “As a psychiatrist, I maintain that the vast majority of cases that involve violence do not include mental illness.”
Ankita Sukheja, a student at the Graduate School of Education who attended the talk, said she was attracted to the talk because of an interest in global affairs.
“I’m an international student,” Sukheja said. “We’re more and more becoming a globalized economy all over, so I wanted to know details about the event, so that’s why I’m here.”

UPDATED: March 23, 2016, at 10:52 a.m.
After a federal judge allowed two claims to move forward last month in a multimillion-dollar patent royalties lawsuit filed against Harvard by a former graduate student, both parties filed statements on Monday, highlighting sharp, unresolved divides on issues of liability and relief.
Former Harvard Ph.D. student Mark G. Charest, who worked in the laboratory of Chemistry and Chemical Biology of professor Andrew G. Myers, filed the lawsuit in 2013.
Charest, along with others in the lab, discovered a technique for synthetically creating a new class of tetracycline antibiotics, an invention that Harvard patented and licensed to the life science company Tetraphase, created by Myers and Harvard’s Office of Technology Development. The Tetraphase license is characterized in court filings as the technology office's “most successful license to date,” potentially bringing in over $1 billion in revenue.
In an amended complaint filed in January 2014, Charest alleged that the Office of Technology Development and Myers coerced him into accepting a lower share of inventor royalties from the patent. The complaint also alleges that the office later reallocated a portion of the license royalties to a separate patent—to which Charest did not contribute—to effectively halve his share.
Charest further claimed that when he appealed the adjustment of royalty shares, Harvard violated its intellectual property policy by sending the appeal to an ad hoc committee of professors allegedly reliant on funding, convened by then-University Provost Steven E. Hyman, rather than to a standing committee of intellectual property appointed by the University President.
“I struggle to understand how the President and Fellows can defend the behavior detailed in the court’s proceedings, this behavior is clearly at odds with Harvard’s stated mission and values,” Charest wrote in an e-mailed statement. He also alleges that Harvard had withheld royalties from him and would not release the amount he was owed unless he signed a release of claims against the University.
“What typically happens in those situations is that the parties sit down together and figure it amongst themselves, and so it rarely goes to trial, it rarely gets to the point where somebody files suit,” Jennifer Carter-Johnson, a law professor at Michigan State University who has been following the case, said. “But the problem of a disagreement amongst parties is fairly common.”
In a February opinion, U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock dismissed five of the seven claims against the University, including all claims against Myers. The court’s memorandum and order stated that, even though Charest’s allegations of coercion may have represented sufficient reason to take legal action under Massachusetts law, they had run past the relevant statute of limitations and had to be dismissed.
Two claims, however, will move forward: first, the claim that the University’s intellectual property policy is an enforceable contract and that the alleged lack of a fair appeals process for Charest represents a breach of that contract; second, the claim that Harvard’s withholding of royalties owed to Charest constitutes an “unfair or deceptive” business act outlawed under Massachusetts law.
Myers did not respond to requests for comment.
David J. Cameron, Harvard’s director of media relations, wrote in an e-mailed statement that the University was “pleased that five of seven claims have been dismissed at this early stage of the case, including all the claims asserted against Professor Myers.”He added that Harvard looks forward to “presenting evidence to defeat the two remaining claims in the next phases of litigation.” The University maintains that it fulfilled any procedural promises it made to Charest and that it had no intention of withholding payment from him, according to Cameron.
“A whinny is as good as a nod to a blind horse,” Woodlock, the judge, said in response to the latter argument, according to a 2014 transcript of court proceedings provided to The Crimson. “Nobody gave him the money.” Woodlock had also characterized Harvard’s intellectual property appeal process as “shoddy” and “raggedy-ass.”
Both parties filed supplemental statements to a joint statement on Monday, registering their disagreement about the scope of the case and Harvard’s liabilities. Harvard has argued that even if it is found liable for the remaining two claims, the court should “remand” the case to the University. With a remand, Charest would go through another appeal as dictated by Harvard’s intellectual property policies, instead of receiving damages determined by the court.
“This has never happened before,” said Michael J. Tuteur ’80, a litigation attorney whose firm is representing Harvard in the case, according to the 2014 transcript. “So one of the reasons it may be raggedy-ass is because [Harvard] had never actually had to go through it before. And maybe this is a lesson learned.”
In a supplemental filing, Harvard’s counsel also wrote that it would be inappropriate for the court to calculate damages based on speculation about future royalties, characterizing the allocation of royalty shares between the two patents as an internal matter.
Brian D. O’Reilly, who is representing Charest in the case, called the University’s position one of “extreme arrogance.”
“This is not some student disciplinary proceeding that Courts have sometimes been reluctant to interfere with,” O’Reilly wrote in his supplemental filing. “This is a classic contract case and the Court should treat it as such.”
The case will likely not go to trial until late 2016.
Though universities vary widely in their intellectual property policies and the structures that they have in place for resolving disputes similar to Charest’s, Carter-Johnson, the Michigan State University law professor, said the outcome of the case could set the tone for discussions among co-inventors going forward.
“There are all sorts of negotiating power imbalances in these discussions: a graduate student relies on their PI to give them recommendations, to sign off on their thesis, and those sorts of things,” Carter-Johnson added. “Depending on how this case comes out, it will impact whether graduate students think it’s worth it to advocate for themselves.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: March 23, 2016
A previous version incorrectly spelled the last name of the U.S. District Court Judge overseeing the royalties case. His name is Woodlock, not Woodstock.

Earlier this month, the University’s sexual assault prevention task force released the findings of a near two year effort to study and address sexual misconduct on campus. In the wide-ranging report, the task force recommends instituting mandatory sexual assault prevention training, creating a new administrative post focused on prevention efforts, combating the influence of the College’s male final clubs, and establishing annual school-based surveys. Along with a 20-page report, the task force published dozens of pages of subcommittee research and data on the prevalence of sexual harassment on campus. Senior writers from the The Crimson's News Board parsed through the final report to highlight eight key takeaways. Click on each note to view the entire report.
*This point comes from a separate document compiled by the task force's outreach subcommittee.
For months, male final clubs have worried that administrators would consider barring undergraduates from entry into the organizations, an option that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has refused to rule out. Amid this pressure, two final clubs broke from more than a century of tradition and accepted female members, and at least one other geared up for a potential legal battle with the University. Here, the task force’s outreach subcommittee makes the first public recommendation that the College consider forbidding undergraduates from joining single gender final clubs, a measure that would almost certainly draw ire, and potential litigation, from the male groups.
Even ignoring the final club-specific three-page addendum to the report, these sentences represent a near-complete reversal of the College’s decades-long strategy of refusing to recognize or directly oversee the clubs. While administrators have previously characterized the organizations as against the mission of the College, the report’s unequivocal condemnation of the clubs is notable, and could signal further action. In 2014, after the release of an analogous sexual misconduct report, Amherst banned student involvement in “fraternity-like and sorority-like organizations.”
Currently, the Title IX office employs a slew of administrators who focus in part on policy—including University Title IX officer Mia Karvonides, who oversees Harvard’s compliance with the law and coordinates investigations into complaints. The newest addition to the ever-growing Title IX bureaucracy will focus specifically on just one goal: the prevention of sexual assault at Harvard. The creation of a new University-wide position echoes a greater institutional shift in recent decades—the move toward locating resources in and crafting policies from Harvard's central administration.
Last fall, results to a University-wide survey revealed what administrators called a “troubling” sexual assault climate on campus. The survey, which Harvard administered along with 26 other schools, asked students to assess their knowledge of the University’s sexual assault resources and whether they had experienced sexual assault or harassment while enrolled. Under the report’s recommendation, individual schools would create their own surveys to understand the prevalence of sexual assault on their campuses, which could offer Harvard more data than ever before about sexual misconduct across its vastly different units.
Undergraduates have called for required annual sexual assault prevention trainings—the College currently holds mandatory training for freshmen—over the past few semesters. During the Undergraduate Council’s most recent presidential campaign, for example, several tickets included the proposal in their platform. If implemented, such training would mark a significant increase in training for students, who indicated in the University-wide sexual climate survey that they were generally unaware of Harvard’s sexual assault policies.
At a town hall hosted in early March intended to inform students of Harvard’s Title IX policies, a number of students complained that Harvard’s “unwelcome conduct” standard was confusing. Last semester, student activists criticized a document released by Harvard’s Title IX Office intended to clarify the University’s Title IX procedures, calling the document “totally inaccessible.” The University-wide survey indicated that a sizable portion of students did not know how the University defined sexual harassment or which office investigated complaints.
The College has wavered back and forth on whether to allow hard alcohol on campus. In 2010, Harvard banned hard alcohol at on-campus House formals, and in 2011 it extended that restriction to off-campus House formals. But in 2012, Harvard reversed both of those decisions, citing student feedback. The debate, though, was far from over. Earlier this semester, Mather House outlawed the consumption of hard alcohol in its Junior Common Room, but just weeks later walked back that policy. Now, the report suggests perhaps it is best Harvard move again towards banning liquor. Peer institutions have also grappled with allowing hard alcohol on campus. Last January, Dartmouth authorized a campus-wide moratorium on hard liquor, citing dangerous student incidents involving hard alcohol.
Decreasing entry points would likely prove to be easier in some locations and harder in others. Adams and Cabot have a relatively high number of entrances, while some other Houses including Mather and Dunster have fewer entrances.
—Staff writers Jalin P. Cunningham, Andrew M. Duehren, C. Ramsey Fahs, Melissa C. Rodman, Ignacio Sabate, Luca F. Schroeder, and Daphne C. Thompson compiled this report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 20 Ph.D. students in the Graduate School of Design and the History of Art and Architecture Department met with administrators on Wednesday to review student benefits and relay frustrations to the graduate school leadership.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences dean for administration and finance Allen Aloise initiated the series of meetings, called “graduate student outreach meetings,” in the fall. To date, GSAS administrators have met with students in 28 departments, and intend to reach out to every department, with separate meetings for students seeking master’s degrees. 
“I wanted to hear directly from graduate students about what is working and what could be improved in the graduate student experience,” Aloise wrote in an email.
According to a document from GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall , administrators have discussed transportation, stipend support, housing, teaching assignments, childcare, and dental insurance at the meetings.
Brett Culbert, a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of Design, said Wednesday’s meeting was an effective way to communicate his concerns as a graduate student.
“In general, I got the feeling that they want to help us,” Culbert said. “It’s nice when you can be with your peers and air out these complaints or grievances as a group.”
According to Culbert, administrators said at the meeting they hope to devise a central posting board for teaching positions, which could be useful to students in departments without pipelines of master’s students or undergraduates. According to the document from Hall, GSAS administrators are currently reviewing the teaching appointment process and issues with late pay, and are also assessing dental benefits.
The meeting comes at a time when GSAS administrators have expanded some graduate student benefits, and a majority of graduate students have called for the formation of a union and collective bargaining rights. GSAS administrators, meanwhile, have strongly opposed the unionization effort.
Although Ph.D. stipends increase regularly each year, GSAS increased their MBTA discount to 50 percent in January and doubled the stipend and leave time for expectant or adoptive parents in February.
Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana said the MBTA discount change came from discussions at an outreach meeting, where students raised concerns about the cost of transportation.
Some graduate students said they have noticed a correlation between union organizing and administrative changes to benefit packages.
Union supporter Matthew L. Santana, a Ph.D. candidate in the Music Department who attended an outreach meeting last semester, said he thinks it is “fairly clear” that the meetings are a direct result of the unionization effort.
Culbert, who is not a member of the unionization effort, said the meetings and additional benefits appear to be tied to union organizing. But he expressed doubt over whether a union could solve student concerns.
“There’s less motivation here to unionize in our department, and I know many students who are opposed to it,” Culbert said. “I would definitely support probably many of the points that people who want to unionize are going after. [But] my knee jerk reaction, my gut reaction isn’t to immediately be like ‘oh let’s unionize.’”
Santana acknowledged that there is no way to predict the success of a potential graduate student union, but said that is not a reason to stop the effort. He added he thinks a union is necessary to ensuring changes get made.
“As long as there’s not a union, they’re not protected by a contract,” Santana said, referring to new benefits for graduate students.
Going forward, Culbert said GSAS administrators should be held accountable for the work they are doing to augment benefit packages and the graduate student experience.
“The best thing to do probably is to come back here in four months so we can return to these points and see what kind of progress is being made,” Culbert said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In the midst of one its most challenging weeks of the year—with two games against top 10 programs in seven days—the Harvard women’s lacrosse team faced a different kind of test this Tuesday. Squaring off against a squad that has yet to pick up a win this season, the Crimson needed to keep its focus and avoid slipping up.
In the end, Harvard (5-2, 1-0 Ivy) did exactly that, riding a dominant first half to a 13-3 victory over Holy Cross (0-9, 0-1 Patriot) in Worcester, Mass.
“The game went really well tonight,” junior attacker Marisa Romeo said. “They put a lot of pressure on but we handled it well. Lots of people played and everyone contributed to the winning effort.”
A standout performance from the offense helped lead the Crimson to the win. Junior attacker Maeve McMahon was perfectly efficient on the night, notching four goals on four shots.
Meanwhile, Romeo collected three goals and three assists to take her points total for the year to a team-high 22.
McMahon’s sparkling conversion rate reflected a team-wide efficiency in front of net. While the Crusaders actually outshot Harvard on the night, 28-22, the Crimson put the same amount of shots on goal as did Holy Cross.
The Crusaders were unable to convert their higher shot total to goals largely because of co-captain goalkeeper Kelly Weis. The senior stopped a career-high 15 shots to limit the Crusaders to their lowest goal count against the Crimson since 2008.
Weis’ dominant showing between the pipes topped off a strong night for the entire Harvard defense that saw the Crimson outdo the home team in both ground balls and draw controls.
Sophomore midfielder Nekele McCall ruled the draw circle, finishing the game with eight draw controls, more than Holy Cross managed as a team.
“The defense slowed down their o fense and came up with key caused turnovers, and we didn’t let them go on a run and fight back in the second half.” sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn said. “Kelly had a great game in cage and Nekele came up with the draws when we needed them.”
With the offense firing on all cylinders and the back line holding strong, Harvard slowly built up a decisive lead over the course of the first half that it would not relinquish all night.
McMahon picked up her first goal three minutes after the opening whistle, but the Crusaders defense would find its footing, keeping the Crimson from increasing its lead until Romeo finally broke through to collect her first score of the night seven minutes later.
McMahon then chipped in two more goals, both assisted by Romeo, to put Harvard up, 4-0, halfway through the period.
Holy Cross cut into the Crimson’s advantage with a finish from attacker Tess MacKay, but the visitors responded with four goals in two minutes to crush any attempt at a comeback. Senior midfielder Alexis Nicolia, sophomore attacker Eliza Guild, McMahon, and Glynn each found the back of the net to pull the team’s lead to 8-1.
Nicolia and Romeo would each put away one more goal before halftime, while Weis and the rest of the Harvard defense held firm at the other end to send the Crimson into the break ahead by nine points.
Determined to put the game to bed, Harvard burst out of the gates in the second stanza, as freshman midfielder Ali Thaler scored in the first minute of the period, and fellow freshman and midfielder Caroline Garrity picked up her first score of the season two minutes later.
Romeo notched her third goal of the contest and her 16th of the year with 25:31 on the clock to round out Harvard’s scoring for the evening.
Holy Cross would claw back with two more finishes before the final whistle, but it would not be enough to keep Harvard from collecting the win.
Although it came against a non-conference opponent, the victory could help Harvard establish some confidence as it heads back into Ivy League play against No. 10 Princeton.
“This game will help us for Princeton because we got to see a different type of defense and offensive formation,” Romeo said. “That will help us to learn how to adjust to whatever is thrown at us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, while most students were on break from school, the Harvard baseball team (5-7) traveled down to Florida to gear up for the Ivy League season and continue its non-conference schedule.
Despite the team finishing the trip with only three victories out of eight contests, junior pitcher Nick Gruener shone for the Crimson. He recorded 11 total strikeouts over his two outings, with seven against Florida and four against Army.
“Nick’s been having a great season, and it puts a little bit less pressure on the offense when you have a guy that’s pitching very well,” captain DJ Link said, “We’re extremely confident in all our guys going out there, but it lets everyone relax a little bit.”
Going into the second game of a double header in Gainesville, Harvard had already suffered two losses against the Gators (21-1) that weekend by a combined margin of 16 runs. Gruener’s mindset going into the final game against the SEC powerhouse was to do more than just pitch well.
“I had to think that I was the best pitcher out there,” Gruener said, “I couldn’t think ‘Oh my gosh these guys are so much better than me’ because ultimately that would lead to failure.”
Gruener threw seven innings against Florida, only allowing three runs. Considering that the Crimson had allowed 25 runs in the first two games of the series, and that the Gators score more than six runs per game on average, his performance was a boost for the Crimson.
He even managed to keep the Gators off the scoreboard until the seventh inning.
“They seemed like in that last game that they got their leadoff runner on, which is tough for a pitcher to pitch out of,” Link said. “I think Nick did a really good job of staying within himself and staying composed and not letting up too many runs when they’re getting their leadoff guy on.”
The Miami, Fla., native not only had to compete against Florida’s explosive offense, but also the arm of sophomore Alex Faedo. Faedo recorded 13 strikeouts and allowed only two hits in eight innings.
Gruener, however, matched him inning-for-inning for the majority of the game, which brought energy and confidence into Harvard’s dugout.
“Guys were really fired up. It was exciting that whole game because it was 0-0 against the best team in the country,” Gruener said.
Gruener’s strong performance brought excitement to the stands as well. Having attended Miami Palmetto High School, some of his friends came out to see their old classmate face the top-ranked team in the nation.
“I had 20 or 30 students from my high school, and they were crazy. They were down the right field line going nuts after every strikeout,” Gruener said.
The next week the Crimson would face off against Army (8-10), where the confidence gained from the Florida game fueled Gruener to another solid performance.
The right-hander threw four strikeouts while allowing just three runs, two earned, in nine innings. Gruener led Harvard to a 5-3 victory over the Black Knights, and in the process notched his second win of the year.
The righty went the distance for the Crimson in its final tilt with Army, scaering nine hits over his nine innings of work. The complete game is the third in his career and the first of the young season.
Gruener has been a regular starter for the Crimson ever since his freshman year in 2014. He pitched 83 innings over his first two seasons, only allowing four home runs in those first years.
But even after contributing his first two seasons with the squad, Gruener is having the best statistical campaign of his career to date. His 2.86 ERA is well below his career average of 4.82 and he’s sporting a 16-to-1 strikeouts-to-walks ratio.

Now that we’re all back from #SB2K16, the cold reality of Boston has hit us once again. And we're not talking about the snow, we're referring to Housing Day results.
I couldn’t help but notice that some freshmen were absolutely devastated when they got #quadded. If you’re one of the few freshmen who got Currier, Cabot, or Pfoho and are wondering how to break the news to your parents, don’t worry. Flyby’s got you covered. As a seasoned Currier tree-ling, let me enlighten you with the wonders of the Quad.
Food:Want to shed the freshman 15 you gained last semester? But you don’t have time to go to those zumba sessions at the MAC? Look no further than the Quad. You won’t be spending all your money or gorging yourself with greasy food at the Kong or Tasty at 4 a.m.
But that doesn’t mean there are no restaurants near the Quad. There are a few hidden gems (and even a Starbucks) on Mass Ave and near Porter Square. A bonus is that these restaurants are cheaper than Harvard Square; your parents will most definitely be happy to hear that.
Facilities:A common chant among Quad Houses during dorm storm is “more singles more sex.” Quad Houses indeed have more singles, resulting in the majority of sophomores getting singles. When calling your parents though, maybe focus more on how much studying you will get done without a roommate to distract you.
Besides the rooming, you can brag to your parents about the new facilities such as the dance center right across Garden street, the QRAC where you can finally #getbig, and the SOCH with its cool study spaces.
Fun:There’s a reason why the Harvard Shuttle is packed on Friday and Saturday nights. Every weekend, there’s always multiple parties throwing down in either Currier’s Tenman or Solarium, Cabot’s Aquarium, or Pfoho’s Belltower or Igloo. No more wandering around the streets of Mt. Auburn.
Another bonus is that you do not have to go to Lamont Cafe anymore as a quadling. Cabot Cafe is a hip late night cafe with your essential coffee, tea, and steaming mugs. Most nights people gather to crank out some work. But some nights, there are concerts by bands like the Lighthouse Keepers with free drinks. Could life get any better?
If coffee isn’t your thing, the Quad Grille, located in Pfoho is another cool spot for late night munchies and games. Their milkshakes, mozzarella sticks and chicken wraps are a staple. While waiting for your food, you can play a game of ping pong or pool or lounge in front of the TV catching the latest March Madness game.
Not convinced yet? Still think the Quad is just a faraway land of exile? I can’t guarantee to sway all your parents, but just remember: You didn’t choose the quadlife. The quadlife chose you.

Remember last year when we gloated over the fact that Yale copied Harvard by adopting CS50, our notorious introductory computer science class with record breaking enrollment numbers of over 800 students? Well, the saying “what goes around comes around” must exist for a reason, since recently some administrators at Harvard have been looking up to Yale to improve its social scene.
This year, the administration’s mission seem to be want to create inclusive, open, and safe social spaces on campus. Eli Schachar, a Lowell Resident tutor, has a few suggestions for how the College can work towards this goal. And, he happens to be a Yalie. Here are some of his suggestions:
A Harvard version of Toad’sToad’s, the notorious nightclub in New Haven, has its mixed reviews with its sketchy townies and sticky floors (but let’s be real; final club floors are sticky too). But we have to admit their party was lit during Harvard Yale weekend. It would be cool to have a Harvard version as well. Perhaps the club above Kong is a possibility. Chinese food and an open party space? Sounds like heaven to me.
More in-suite common roomsThe recent house renovations in Quincy, Dunster and Leverett have received criticism for the replacement of in-suite common rooms for hallway common rooms. In suite common rooms might very well be the inclusive social space so many students are pining for, something the administration should keep in mind with the renovations for Winthrop and Lowell coming up.
Freshmen live with upperclassmen in HousesYale is known for their residential college system, which are kind of like Harvard’s houses, except with freshmen. Instead of being sorted on housing day, Yale freshmen are sorted into their residential colleges before they even step on campus. This could have its pros and cons as we would lose Housing Day, a beautiful Harvard tradition. Plus, who will live in the yard dorms? Will freshmen live in the Quad as well? How many freshmen will get lost on their way to class? There are too many unanswered questions here.
Undergrad RA’s instead of resident tutorsLike many other colleges, Yale has undergrad RA’s or resident assistants instead of proctors and tutors. So instead of an angry and sleep-deprived grad student shutting your party down, it might be an even more sleep-deprived fellow Harvard student. This modification would really change the social dynamic. Some interesting possibilities here.
Perhaps a change is in need, despite the fact that the inspiration came from an icky place called New Haven. But some of these suggestions would change some of the fundamental traditions and nature of Harvard. It will be up to the administration as well as the voice of the students to decide what kind of Harvard we want to become.

With Yardfest only a month away, the rumor mill has been churning out potential artists almost as fast as the mumps spread from the PSK to the rest of the campus. While it seems like we won’t be saying “hey what’s up hello” to Fetty Wap after all, there is one possible headliner who could be just as “damn fine, tho”.
A little bird (or maybe it was the Mather turkey) told us that Steve Aoki will be the latest artist to join the likes of Jessie J and Tyga as Yardfest headliner. Don’t know who that is? Still bitter that it won’t be Fetty? Well fear not, Flyby has compiled a list of pro tips on how to have a bangin’ time regardless if you’re a die hard Aoki fan or if you’re just as indifferent about him as you are about Yenching leaving the Square.
TailgateWho says tailgates are just for sports? Skip your boozy Sunday brunch plans and participate in the pre-Yardfest tradition of party hopping all down Mt. Auburn Street. Just make sure to remember your face mask before entering the PSK.
THE FOODDon’t forget that half the fun of Yardfest is the buffet style barbeque feast. Bonus points if you can find the truck of ice cream sandwiches to satisfy your mid-day munchies.
SnapchatSee if you can get close enough to the stage to use a Snapchat face filter on Steve Aoki’s face. If not, Snap Story your heart away so you can relive all your regrets while recovering from your wild night in your Monday morning lecture, because yes, to all who weren’t aware, Yardfest is in fact on a Sunday this year.
People watchPlay “I Spy: 9am-er Edition”. Challenge your squad to see who can spot the most students awkwardly standing around looking confused (or envious) about everyone being so turnt.
Steal the showTeach yourself how to DJ and then learn every single Steve Aoki track so you can jump on stage and perform with him. Or in the event that all the rumors are false, replace whoever the actual artist is with the Steve Aoki favorites that everyone now has their heart set on. HUPD will be too preoccupied checking IDs and attempting to keep out wandering tourists to notice. Trust us.
Still uncertain whether or not you’ll have a good time? Well, don’t forget that Steve Aoki is the dude that basically provided the soundtrack for Project X. If anyone can breath some life into our comatose social scene, it’s him. So, start blasting “Boneless” to annoy all your neighbors who think studying is more important than Yardfest and get pumped for April 24th a.k.a. Harvard’s’ attempt to trick pre-frosh into thinking we can actually have fun!
