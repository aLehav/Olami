After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In anticipation of his upcoming album “Set My Heart On Fire Immediately,” Mike Hadreas — better known by his alias, Perfume Genius — released the singles “On the Floor” and “Describe” on Mar. 16. Hadreas, who in his Spotify biography is described as being a singer/songwriter “whose music spans fragile piano ballads and swaggering glam rock as he explores sexuality, homophobia, and domestic abuse with brutal and often poetic honesty,” showcases both fragility and swagger with songs that are raw and scathingly honest.
“On the Floor,” the second single from the album and the A-side on this release, starts with an upbeat and summery intro. The lyrics, however, are sobering. “Lock the door / The constant buzzing / All through the night / The fighting / Rips me all up inside,” sings Hadreas, his voice lilting over the song’s funky guitar. If it weren’t for the strain in his voice, you’d hardly notice the dark undercurrent of the lyrics as they clash with the lively music.
Over top of swirling synths and deceptive, luscious harmonies, Andreas’ vocals throughout “On the Floor” are almost painful in their ache and earnestness. “(How long ‘til) this washes away? / (How long ‘til) my body is safe?” he sings in the song’s chorus, anxiously pleading with his listener for an answer as the harmonies complete his thoughts before he can get them out himself. “Take this wildness away,” he begs.
The song is incessant in its outward cheer, though Hadreas’s mind is on other things. He sings of being trapped, but the music forces him into a feigned happiness. Beneath the bubbling sound, all his words convey is longing. “I just want him in my arms,” he repeats, dejected yet hopeful, as the music fades into a sparkling piano outro.
The second track and B-side of the single release, “Describe,” bursts open with thick and sludgy guitars, contrasted with Hadreas’s sulking vocals. “Can you describe them for me?” he begs in the chorus, referring to his inability to understand his own emotions. Despite this entreaty, his voice gives the impression that he’s already given into whatever numbness is plaguing him throughout the track — a numbness characterized by the muddiness of the music, with its heavy electric guitars and thumping bass drum.
“I started writing about when you are in such a dark place that you don’t even remember what goodness is or what anything feels like. And so, the idea was having someone describe it to you, because you forgot or can’t get to it,” Hadreas said of the single in an interview with DIY Mag.
With each line, each plea to “just wait here with me,” the song builds and builds and builds to silence, as grungy guitars are replaced with a deafening stillness in the stripped-down second half of the song. Synths rise and fall as if they were water — giving the song a hauntingly beautiful ending, both brutal and honest.

Demi Lovato’s latest release, “I Love Me,” is a powerful testament against the judgement that she has endured from both the media and her own inner critic. In many ways, it’s a sharp contrast to her more recent single “Anyone.” The fun, upbeat song, which makes up for unimpressive instrumentals with meaningful lyrics, belongs on every empowering pump-up playlist as a reminder that if Lovato could make it through such an arduous journey, her listeners can, too.
On Mar. 5, Lovato revealed in an interview on “The Ellen Show” that her prior management team went to extreme lengths to control her lifestyle, worsening a preexisting eating disorder and putting her in a negative headspace that led to her eventual relapse. Now, with a new team to support her, Lovato is in a much better place.
“If you do go through this, you yourself can get through it. You can get to the other side, and it may be bumpy, but you are a ten out of ten, don’t forget it,” she said. “And as long as you take the responsibility, you can move past it and learn to love yourself the way that you deserve to be loved.”
Lovato’s message could not be clearer in her new single, which boasts lyrics that reject comparison and promote self-love. “Why am I always looking for a ride or die?” she sings in the verse. “‘Cause mine’s the only heart I’m gonna have for life.” No longer dependent on others for validation, Lovato encourages listeners to accept their flaws, calling for body positivity and combatting superficial criticism.
Unfortunately, the instrumentals of her new single leave something to be desired, with a synth-heavy pop beat that’s formulaic, repetitive, and reminiscent of Katy Perry’s “Roar.” Nonetheless, while the form of the song is not unique, “I Love Me” still has strong moments, particularly ones that showcase Lovato’s wide vocal range. In the outro, she effortlessly hits high, victorious notes and performs elegant vocal runs, reminding listeners of her talent.
Lovato’s music video for the single is full of Easter eggs, with references ranging from her early days on “Barney & Friends” to her experience with the Jonas Brothers in “Camp Rock” to, more soberingly, her near-fatal overdose in 2018. After fighting off a human embodiment of her darker thoughts, Lovato confidently struts around New York in a bright red trench coat, walking past nods to her milestones as dancers surround her with joyful choreography.
Ultimately, Lovato’s “I Love Me” signifies monumental growth in her career and personal life. The single is a representation of pure resilience, building excitement for the upcoming songs that will undoubtedly provide more insight and inspiration.

As people all around the world settle into the rhythm of working from home, social distancing, and self-quarantining due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an unforeseen situation has arisen as a consequence: the ascent of Instagram challenges. Without the time spent walking to and from class, travelling to work, or hanging out with friends, many young people have found themselves with an unprecedented number of unoccupied hours in their days. To fill this space, millennials and Gen Zers have turned to our trusty friend, Social Media.
An Instagram challenge is typically some kind of task that a user fulfills, posts photo or video evidence of, and then tags a handful of friends, challenging them to do the same. These tasks are not a new phenomenon resulting from self-isolation, but the sheer number and increasing ridiculousness of them is.
The first “challenge,” which purportedly originated in India, implored users to draw an orange. The trend went viral globally, and suddenly images of all kinds of fruits and vegetables flooded people’s stories on Instagram.
Interestingly enough, an unexpected consequence of this phenomenon was its ability to reveal people’s surprising creativity. A handful of users took a simple (i.e. boring) approach to their digital paintings, indicating a potato, for instance, with a solid, brown oval. Other potatoes contained facial features or arrays of anthropomorphic additions, with some paying homage to Mr. Potato Head himself. Drawings of oranges morphed into images of Donald Trump and then into the Lorax and back. People utilized full color palettes, livening up their masterpieces with attention to light and shadow, or took the easy route by throwing an emoji on their screen and calling it a day. The random people we follow on Instagram have appeared out of thin air to demonstrate their hidden artistic talents and then retreat into anonymity.
But it didn’t stop at drawing. Instagram users have taken on a number of challenges. The #10for10 pushup challenge features someone filming themselves doing 10 pushups and then tagging 10 friends to continue the chain. The “Until Tomorrow” challenge, where users post embarrassing photos and keep them up for 24 hours, and the omelette-making challenge, which is self-explanatory, follow similar systems.
While these trends are mostly borne out of boredom, they function as a tool for keeping our connections strong in the face of sudden isolation. Interaction is made easier for friends and family who now might be thousands of miles away. We can make fun of these increasingly silly challenges and get annoyed at their prevalence on our feeds, or we can appreciate how they allow us to maintain our relationships and add a bit of liveliness and humor to the otherwise dismal state of our current world.
So, hey, although quarantine might be boring for most young adults right now, at least we can thank it for revealing the surprising artistic merits of our friends.

“Deacon King Kong” is not for cynics. National Humanities Medalist James McBride’s latest novel points to the good in people, no matter how many bad things they’ve done. Set in 1960s Brooklyn, “Deacon King Kong” examines the aftermath of an alcoholic’s attempted murder of a young drug dealer in the Causeway Housing Projects. While other writers would focus on the senseless violence following such an event — such as Marlon James’ “A Brief History of Seven Killings” — McBride builds a hilariously improbable story of grace and redemption. In the face of alarming structural and personal trauma, “Deacon King Kong” is undeniably human and life-affirming.
Does “Deacon King Kong” feel original? Not especially. Some of the character archetypes — mobster with a heart who wants out, grizzled cop getting close to retirement, elderly woman with prescient information, etc. — have been done to the point of staleness. That said, McBride’s characters transcend their tropes because he humanizes them so well. Part of this dimensionality stems from personal experience. “The characters in ‘Deacon King Kong’ are people I’ve known and loved my whole life,” McBride says. Indeed, these characters are so omnipresent because they were commonplace in mid-century New York.
Take the internal suffering of Thomas Elefante, a gangster known as “The Elephant.” The only words he utters after a change of heart are “‘I wish... somebody would love me.’” Leading up to that acceptance, though, McBride offers a full page of metaphors and descriptions, each more depressing than the last, all focused on portraying Elefante as “a dreamless, friendless, futureless, sorry-ass New York guy.” This context is what makes “Deacon King Kong” flow so well. The actions would seem contrived and unearned without McBride’s emotional backdrop. In one sense, the reader needs this context to root for a character like Elefante; in another, the reader is unwilling to rationalize his decisions without it. Elefante’s message to a cop encapsulates McBride’s mission statement: “‘A lot of saints don’t start out well, but they end that way.’”
“Deacon King Kong” succeeds in more than just grounding unseemly characters. The universe around these characters is exceptionally thought-out and feels alive. He describes the borough in a Dickensian way, comparing it to Manhattan, where jobs are plentiful and rents are high. “The Republic of Brooklyn,” on the other hand, is “where cats hollered like people, dogs ate their own feces... and penniless desperation ruled the life of the suckers too black or too poor to leave.”
By focusing on intensely vulnerable characters, McBride shines a light in the darkness. Almost everyone in “Deacon King Kong” is a victim of abuse. A professional hitwoman — whose name would spoil one of the novel’s funniest plot twists — grows disillusioned with the men who raped her mother and sexualized her from a young age. Sportcoat, the would-be murderer who sets the novel’s events into motion, begins his lifelong love affair with alcohol under the auspices of dental students from the University of South Carolina. “‘The habits you acquired was put on you by the very folks who should have helped you be a better person,’” Sportcoat’s deceased wife tells him.
McBride, for his part, shows that these characters have the capacity to grow and overcome. There’s a sense of distributive justice in “Deacon King Kong,” as the characters who desperately seek change tend to find it. As a 108-year-old woman tells Sportcoat, “‘A blessing favors them that needs it. Don’t matter how it comes. It just matters that it does.’”
These heavy-handed themes may inform the novel, but McBride’s writing reads like a farce. Much of the plot revolves around cases of mistaken identity and false perception. Some cases stem from a bureaucracy that cares little about the Black inhabitants of the Cause House. Sportcoat evades police capture after his attempted murder since the cops are searching for the wrong man, relying on an outdated photo and a false name. (“‘How many names do a colored man need in this world?’” asks one of Sportcoat’s friends after this comes to light.) Elefante fails to notice that Sportcoat — one of the most wanted men in Brooklyn — is his mother’s gardener, even though he crosses paths with him several times. At other points, though, McBride invokes almost-divine intervention to advance the plot. Earl, a hitman sent to pulverize Sportcoat, fails in spectacularly unlikely fashion multiple times. An absurd quest subplot revolves around an incredibly valuable object often dismissed as a “bar of soap.”
All of these elements make “Deacon King Kong” a relentlessly compelling read. The plot’s lightheartedness and the deeply serious subtext paint a complicated yet optimistic picture. While McBride casts overdone characters on this journey, “Deacon King Kong”’s righteousness bleeds through the page enough to make a cynic smile.

In the first book of Virgil’s Aeneid, Aeneas tells his men during a time of hardship, “Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit,” which idiomatically translates to, “Maybe we’ll be laughing about even these things in the future.” It is a reminder that even the worst of circumstances eventually come to an end, that humanity can and will persevere through even the most severe destruction. It is a rallying cry in a time of extreme darkness.
I love Virgil, but I’ve always found that line to be complete bullshit. Who wants to look back on the worst moments of your life fondly?
For many of us, one of those worst moments — the ones that simultaneously turn the world upside down and provide clarity about what matters most — happened on March 10, when we woke up to emails from University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana asking undergraduates to leave campus within five days. I’ll forever remember that moment, when I really, truly realized how much I loved my new home just when I realized I had to leave it.
In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III commented, “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.” Forty-three years later, we woke up one morning expecting to study for midterms and went to sleep with our rooms in complete disarray, our lives forever altered. In the blink of an eye, we found ourselves at the end of our world as we knew it with no time to prepare, no time to process.
I miss my friends. I miss my professors.
I miss everything that makes Harvard the place I now call home. I miss the way the sunlight bounces off the couches in the Barker Cafe on a Friday morning. I miss the walk across the John Weeks Bridge at sunset, or sunrise, or really any time of day or night. I miss the silence of the Widener and Langdell reading rooms, a silence that represents an awe-inspiring search for profound intellectual discovery.
This is no blessing in disguise. This is nothing but a loss.
If Virgil’s words could ever ring true, now would be a nice time.
But I’m also not sure I want Virgil to be right. Because realizing what you’re losing is sometimes the easiest way to realize what you’ve already got. Because that horrible, all-encompassing feeling of lacking is an indication of how much you’ve been given. Because being without makes you appreciate every moment you have.
Because forever remembering how hard you sobbed when it all came to an end on that fateful day in March will ensure that you never again wish a moment at Harvard away.
When I consider skipping a lecture one day in the future, I want to remember what it felt like to realize I wouldn’t be walking to lecture at all. When I complain about the amount of work I have piling up, I want to remember what it felt like to wish for nothing more than to be able to walk into the stacks of Widener and check out a book for a research paper.
When we go back, I hope we live every day at Harvard like we’re about to wake up to an email asking us to leave campus. I hope we live every day at Harvard like it’s our last not because we live in fear of March 10, 2020 all over again, but because that day taught us a hard lesson about the magic that surrounds us in Cambridge.
What will define how this community, broken by circumstance, comes back together is not what has happened but how we shape what is to come with the decisions we make today and tomorrow. How we repair all that we’ve lost. Whether we make the most of the time we have left at Harvard. Because there’s just so much left to do, to discover, to experience. Because four years at Harvard wasn’t enough to begin with.
I don’t think I’ll ever be laughing about all of this, but I can’t wait to feel whatever I feel when “indefinitely” finally comes to a long-awaited end and an email tells us that we can come back home. I’m holding onto a feeling that I haven’t even felt yet, for I already know that it will be like no other.

On March 27, 1,085 high school students received news of their acceptances to the Harvard College Class of 2024 under a bizarre set of circumstances.
To those students, currently scattered across the world, we would first and foremost like to say: Congratulations! We are so happy for you, and we sincerely hope that you choose to become part of our community. You will bring your creative spirits, your intellectual curiosity, and your unique perspectives to campus, and our community will be better for it.
We also understand that it is a particularly difficult time to decide which college to attend, especially given the uncertainty of visas for international students, financial strain on families, and other unique challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Visitas usually presents a wonderful opportunity to gain insight into the Harvard community. While visiting campus will not be a possibility this spring, we encourage you to think more broadly about what type of college community you hope to be part of. Consider the activities you most enjoy, the community life you are most passionate about joining, the dreams you hope to reach. We encourage you to seek the school where you will be the most-supported, academically-enriched, and happiest version of yourself.
Know that there is most certainly a place for you here at Harvard.
The coronavirus crisis has reminded us that at the heart of every institution, no matter how large or small, is the collective, everyday life of its constitutive members. Our community is at its strongest when we approach others from a place of compassion and empathy, when we are together even as we are apart. No matter where you choose to go, we hope that this lesson carries over into the friendships you make and the courses you chart through the coming years.
Perhaps the most important takeaway in the turmoil of this pandemic is that the individuals and communities which matter most to you are not confined to a physical location or place. As you step into the uncertainty of your next four years, cherish those who are sustaining you in this difficult time. Know that your supporters struggle for you, and be prepared to engage in similar struggles for your college peers where they face injustice, pain, and conflict.
Of course, no virtual interaction can possibly replace visiting Harvard for yourself. While we hope that you choose to come to Harvard and become a part of this community, we hope you do so for reasons beyond Harvard’s name.
Of course, to gain a better understanding of our community, we encourage you to embrace the opportunities that Virtual Visitas affords you in connecting with your future peers and our campus resources.
Once again, congratulations! We hope to see you on campus in the fall.

Maybe you’ve noticed that grocery stores have been a lot emptier recently. The looming threat of coronavirus has caused Americans to clear out supermarket shelves, hoarding massive quantities of food, toilet paper, and other household goods. Combine fear over potential supply chain disruptions and a healthy dose of herd mentality — as in, “If everybody’s buying food, will there be any left for me?” — and it shouldn’t be surprising that it’s getting hard to find peanut butter with consistency.
These concerns are actually valid. American farmers are facing an unprecedented loss of labor, and we import a lot of our food, like Vietnamese rice, from countries no longer sending their food abroad. However, there is no sign that we will actually run out of food. In fact, if the level of food waste in this country is any indication, we’ve always had more food than we can consume. Americans will not starve in this crisis — so long as they are wealthy enough. While Americans with sufficient means buy up flour and beans, those with less are facing an extended period of hunger.
For a developed country, the United States has a massive hunger problem, which has largely been allowed to fester. Under normal circumstances, an estimated 40 million U.S. residents are food insecure, including one in every seven households with children. Currently, the Supplemental Nutrition Access Program, colloquially known as “food stamps,” serves 45 million Americans. This program has suffered cuts in recent years, and now averages about $4.15 in assistance per person per day. SNAP-dependence is so restrictive that entire food groups, particularly fruits and vegetables, can be unaffordable.
In the past, we have assumed that a combination of SNAP and charitable programs will meet the needs of the impoverished. In reality, however, this system was already failing millions of Americans. A pandemic will only destabilize it further, leading to potentially disastrous consequences.
Unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic has soared, and there is no indication that this trend will stop soon. Many experts estimate that it has already reached 13 percent and might rise to as high as 32 percent — higher than the unemployment peak of the Great Depression. Moreover, the people being laid off are disproportionately those in low-paying, service jobs — precisely those for whom even a relatively marginal loss of income is significant.
These mass layoffs will obviously impact the ability of the poorest Americans to feed themselves. A Feeding America study found that a 7.6 percent increase in unemployment and four percent increase in poverty would leave 17.1 million more people with food insecurity. We are now facing an increase in unemployment potentially four times that. In the coming months, tens of millions more Americans will likely struggle to feed themselves.
Unfortunately, SNAP and food banks might not cover such gaps in income. The latest coronavirus relief bill, which became law, includes some increased funding for SNAP, but many experts warn that given the circumstances, it won’t be enough to keep poor Americans fed. Many food pantries have shut down due to fears about the virus, and pantries that remain open are running low on food, at least partially a result of hoarding. Compounding this situation, the price of food could rise in the coming months as the supply of food decreases.
This will be particularly difficult for children and the elderly. They are already more likely to go hungry than other groups, and the supplementary aid they receive is directly threatened by this pandemic. Millions of children across the country rely on their schools, which are now closing, for meals. Though some school districts have found ways to get food to low-income students, this isn’t the case everywhere. Meanwhile, the elderly often need assistance to go to the grocery store, and may have gotten free meals from senior centers. Those vital social interactions are now potentially deadly.
I think it should be striking that the people who are most likely to die of COVID-19 are also those left most vulnerable in other ways. Crises often exacerbate existing inequalities, and this is no exception. Pandemics might also make class disparities even more severe than a typical economic recession otherwise would. Being sick affects your ability to work, which, in this country, also means it affects your access to healthcare. Thus, the poor are typically sicker, and also more likely to become sick.
Fortunately, there are ways to help. This CNN article, for example, has a list of organizations to which you can donate food or money, if you have the means. Still, we shouldn’t forget the larger lessons this pandemic teaches us. Hunger in this country is optional; we could eliminate it if we had the will. Ultimately, we should choose to make sure that everyone in this country is fed.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow has fully recovered from the novel coronavirus, he said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette Monday.
Bacow first informed Harvard affiliates he and his wife, Adele F. Bacow, tested positive for COVID-19 on March 24. At the time, he wrote that the two tested positive after first experiencing symptoms on March 22. He and his wife experienced coughing, followed by fevers, chills, and muscle aches.
Bacow told the Gazette — a University-run news publication — that he and his wife were “surprised” they contracted the virus. He said they had been very careful to isolate themselves 10 days before they started experiencing symptoms.
“One reason we had taken such precautions is because I live with an autoimmune condition that makes me very susceptible to any kind of infection,” Bacow said. “In fact, some people questioned why I actually got tested. It’s because I’m immunosuppressed. So I was at risk. And when we tested positive I thought, ‘This is going to be interesting.’”
Bacow added that while he was the president of Tufts University in 2004, he fell ill and had to take a month off work to care for his health. He said while he was ill with the virus, he wanted to “model” the type of actions he hoped others would take.
Bacow did not go completely “off the grid” while he was recovering, he said. He regularly checked emails, spoke daily with his Chief of Staff Patricia S. Bellinger '83 and Senior Fellow of the Corporation William F. Lee ’72, and received reports from Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. Bacow also spoke over the phone with Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and other officials in Cambridge, Boston, and Washington, D.C.
“I’ve been on calls with the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts, and the American Council on Education,” he said. “Last weekend we had the governing boards meeting on Zoom. We had a full meeting of the Board of Overseers and a meeting of the Corporation.”
Bacow said he and his wife “must have received a thousand responses” from people — students, faculty, staff, and alumni — all over the world when they made headlines after announcing their diagnosis.
“What was a little strange was lying in bed sick watching CNN, if I recall correctly, and having them report on me being sick,” Bacow said. “That was a bit of an out-of-body experience. Once it made the national news, we started hearing from old friends and family from around the country and around the world.”
In a video accompanying the interview, both President Bacow and Adele Bacow spoke about the impact of messages they received from students while ill.
“We were even more enthused by reading about all of the work that you’re doing, the research that you’re doing, students who are trying so hard to stay up with classes and classmates, what you’re doing to help those around you who might be in need, and all of the creative ways that you’re finding to bring community, deepen community, and bring some levity in these difficult times,” Adele Bacow said.

Harvard is prohibiting all University-related international travel and non-essential domestic air travel through at least May 31, according to an email sent to Harvard affiliates from University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen.
The University is also barring Harvard-organized and Harvard-funded international travel scheduled to take place between now and August 31, the administrators announced. They cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s global Level 3 and Level 4 travel advisories, which mean “avoid non-essential travel” and “do not travel” respectively.
“Personal international travel remains strongly discouraged, and we still urge you to use extreme caution for personal domestic travel,” they wrote. “This guidance pertains to all community members—students, faculty, staff, and postdocs/other academics. Because governments around the world, including the United States, may modify travel restrictions at any time, advance, nonrefundable travel purchases are inadvisable.”
Garber, Lapp, and Nguyen added they anticipate travel “will continue to be disrupted for some time.” They wrote that the decision to prohibit travel is “difficult and disappointing,” but encouraged students to explore alternative options for summer study, research, and work.
“It is unclear when those restrictions will be lifted,” the email read. “We know that many of our students – undergraduates as well as graduate and professional school students – rely on summer travel to further their education, fulfill academic requirements, and explore new work environments.”
The administrators wrote they are monitoring the suspension of visa processing at U.S. consular locations worldwide and are advising the University’s international students and scholars accordingly.
“We anticipate that many newly admitted and returning international students and scholars will face delays in obtaining or renewing visas,” they wrote. “The Harvard International Office (HIO) continues to issue the necessary University documentation for F-1, J-1, and other visa applications, so that when consular processing resumes, students and scholars will have the forms they need to schedule visa appointments.”
Garber, Lapp, and Nguyen concluded the email by thanking frontline health care providers and Harvard’s researchers, faculty, students, and staff.
“Thank you to the frontline workers and our researchers, faculty, students, and staff for your tremendous efforts these past few weeks,” they wrote. “We greatly value your patience, empathy, creativity, and resilience as we face these extraordinary challenges together.”

Harvard and MIT donated $500,000 to a temporary emergency shelter located at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School to house homeless residents, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said in a Monday press release.
Harvard and MIT matched donations — each donating $250,000 — to cover costs associated with the creation of the city’s temporary shelter.
The City Manager’s office announced Cambridge would open the school’s War Memorial Recreation Center, Field House, and garage to shelter the city’s homeless residents on April 1.
Local public health officials deemed the War Memorial Center the “most fitting for public health needs" because of its “proximity to healthcare facilities, quick activation time, physical infrastructure, variety of separable spaces, and secure off street and underground drop off access,” according to the press release.
In their joint-statement, Siddiqui and DePasquale said the residents of Cambridge “have benefited from the extraordinary generosity and partnership” of the city’s businesses and educational institutions since the beginning of the outbreak.
“As we grapple with the enormity of this pandemic, we know that the City must provide an appropriate safe location for our homeless community to take shelter, properly isolate or self-quarantine, and stay safe,” Siddiqui and DePasquale said. “We are grateful to Harvard and MIT for recognizing the critical importance of this Temporary Emergency Shelter and providing this instrumental funding.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the press release that Harvard is “proud” to support Cambridge’s homeless residents and ensure they have access to housing, food, health care, and mental health services alongside MIT and local leaders.
"From emergency housing, to PPE, to research and diagnostics, the entire Harvard community is bringing our best to respond to the many and unexpected issues that the novel coronavirus has presented — and we are honored to be working along so many committed partners in this effort in Cambridge, Greater Boston, and around the world,” he said.
MIT President L. Rafael Reif said in the press release that “supplying financial support to create the emergency shelter” was a logical next step in MIT’s effort to help Cambridge respond to the global pandemic.
“As soon as we understood the need, we knew we wanted to help — and we are pleased to partner with Harvard on this critical initiative,” Reif said. “MIT will also continue its support of Cambridge’s nonprofits, small businesses, and residents as this crisis unfolds. The leadership of Mayor Siddiqui, City Manager DePasquale, and the City Council have been a powerful inspiration.”
“With each passing day, it becomes more obvious that we are all interdependent, bound together as neighbors,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley and two other Medical School faculty advocated for the use of “triage committees” within individual hospitals to address a potential shortage of ventilators nationwide in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine late last month.
Robert D. Truog and Christine Mitchell — the Director and Executive Director of the Harvard Center for Bioethics, respectively — co-authored the paper, which was in part a reaction to reports from countries hit hard by the novel coronavirus.
Daley wrote in an emailed statement that in the weeks leading up to the article, he had been in contact with colleagues in China, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy.
“I became aware of hospital systems becoming overwhelmed, leaving physicians unable to deliver the highly individualized care they have come to expect,” he wrote. “This raised the question of traditional triage in settings usually restricted to battlefields, now that the battlefield is our hospitals.”
In Italy, 10 to 25 percent of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 required a ventilator. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 2.4 million to 21 million Americans will require hospitalization — but there are just 62,000 full-function ventilators and 98,000 basic ventilators in the nation, plus an additional 8,900 in a federal stockpile, according to the paper.
Accordingly, the paper predicted that the number of patients in need of ventilation could range from 1.4 to 31 patients per ventilator.
If faced with such a shortage, the authors recommended that decisions regarding which patients should receive ventilators be made by a designated “triage committee” rather than the medical professionals performing direct patient care. Per the paper, triage committees would be made up of volunteers “who are respected clinicians and leaders among their peers and the medical community.”
According to the paper, committees would allow doctors and nurses to maintain their roles as advocates for their patients and remove the weight of decisions from individual providers, among other benefits.
Mitchell, who is a registered nurse, said triage committees will also help ensure decisions are consistent and remove the possibility that different providers make different decisions in similar cases.
“You're worried particularly around the principle of justice and fairness and ensuring that not just the right people received the right resources, which of course is critical, but also that similar cases get treated similarly,” Mitchell said. “That's an expectation of fairness.”
Mitchell and Daley both said “ad hoc” decisions leave more room for bias and errors than a committee-led process.
“I have more reservations about leaving such challenging clinical decisions to individuals acting alone in the heat of moment and subject to potential influences from external forces,” Daley wrote. “Triage committees are set up so that the principles upon which decisions are made are as fair as possible and based on the best evidence available.”
Edwin L. “Ned” Palmer, a doctor at Boston Children’s Hospital and a member of the ethics faculty at the Medical School, said he found the paper “incredibly valuable.”
“Everybody across the country, every health system, will be challenged with these decisions in the coming weeks,” he said. “At this point, it doesn't seem a question of if, it's a question of when.”
Palmer said he supported the use of triage committees because they help shield healthcare providers from the “discord and disconnect” that comes with the choice to remove a patient from a ventilator.
“If these triage panels have one truly tangible benefit, it hopefully absolves you of some of that decision making, and overall reduces your burnout so that you can continue to work,” Palmer said. “I think one of one of the greatest losses here would be losing the nursing, the respiratory therapist, and the physician workforce to depression, to burnout, to post traumatic stress responses, because they were forced to make this decision.”
“In Italy, they had clinicians weeping in the hallways,” he added. “There has been numerous, numerous interviews with Italian intensive care doctors who were being forced to make decisions without support.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 8, 2020, 2:40 p.m.
One Friday last month, Nicholas W. Short sat in his home in Brighton, Mass. teaching a virtual section of Government 1108: “Politics of Economic Inequality,” a gallery of watercolor drawings behind him. As one student made a comment, the artist — Short’s four-year-old daughter — ran into the room and appeared on screen.
Her entrance prompted laughter from the class, but Short said the incident caused him concern.
“I don't know if students find that disruptive or they find it cute or distracting,” he said. “I wasn't actually speaking in the moment. Somebody else was. So I was worried that it would be a — they'd feel like they were being interrupted.”
“I've experimented with locking the door, but that just makes her angry,” he added.
The coronavirus crisis has forced Harvard to shift to remote learning, changing the way teachers communicate and students learn. But it has created unique challenges for instructors parenting young children.
As they navigate working from home without child care, several Harvard teaching instructors with young kids said they face challenges juggling their responsibilities to their children and their students.
Nicholas M. Utzig, who lives in a one-bedroom apartment in New York City with his wife and their two-and-a-half year old son and five-week old daughter, said he is hard-pressed to find several hours in the day when he can focus on his work.
“It's difficult to find — especially without daycare services — to find multiple consecutive hours to really work and get into a rhythm on things,” he said. “You’re sort of always doing a little work, then putting it down to do some family things, because toddlers are very, very busy creatures.”
Still, Utzig said he will prioritize students in the English department junior tutorial he teaches.
“My students depend on me and my performance to kind of help them get through their junior year — to make the most out of this, so I feel a strong obligation to them, first and foremost,” he said. “All of my normal — outside of teaching — grad student responsibilities, like the dissertation type thing or preparing for an article or for a conference or something like that has all been sort of shelved.”
Short also said he will have to delay his dissertation, though he noted he feels less urgency to finish given the contracting academic job market.
“With a lot of work, I could potentially be in a place to go out on the job market in September in political science,” he said. “We're now facing what looks like it will be widespread hiring freezes and no job opportunity. So it's been delayed at least a year, which theoretically gives me more time to do my research, but who knows how long this will go on.”
Anna S. Ivanova, who is quarantining with her husband and their nearly-three-year-old daughter at their home in Cambridge, also said teaching during the coronavirus crisis comes at the expense of her research. Though Ivanova, who teaches two sections of HIST 1280: "History of the Soviet Union," planned to submit her dissertation by next spring, she said meeting that deadline now seems unlikely due to the public health crisis.
Ivanova and her husband have swiftly remodeled their apartment to accommodate working from home. They have converted their daughter’s bedroom into a temporary office, moving her toys into the living room to make room for a desk and chair.
“Small kids are very loud. Just because they're excited all the time,” she said. “I always have to work with some kind of background noise.”
Despite the changes to her personal and professional life, Ivanova said the extra hours in her apartment have afforded her the chance to grow closer to her daughter.
“My own craft skills increased dramatically during these two weeks, because I never spent so much time with her at home,” she said. “We’re drawing and we’re doing PlayDoh, and we’re doing all sorts of crafts all the time, which we never did before.”
History professor Mary D. Lewis, the mother of a 9-year-old and an 11-year-old, said faculty also experience challenges teaching and parenting from home. She said tenure puts her in a more comfortable position than junior faculty.
“I feel extraordinarily fortunate right now. I mean, I have a house with a yard and a Harvard paycheck,” she said. “As far as faculty are concerned, I would be more concerned about junior faculty or faculty who have a non-permanent status who are much more vulnerable right now.”
“I'm in a position of privilege compared to many people who are trying to do this,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Harvard Book Store — an independent bookseller and Cambridge landmark founded in 1932 — has moved all book talks, events, and sales to virtual platforms.
The bookstore closed on March 15, preempting a Massachusetts stay-at-home advisory. But even before that date, general manager Alex W. Meriwether said in a Monday interview, the shop made changes as a result of the virus.
Advising guests to use hand sanitizer became part of the precautionary preamble “in addition to asking people to silence their cell phones” that preceded every Harvard Book Store event, Meriwether said.
Then Rebecca Solnit, an activist and author slated for a sold-out March 11 book talk, cancelled the day before.
Meriwether and his team then made the decision to cancel and refund all store-hosted events — including 44 talks — through April 24. The store announced it would shutter indefinitely, at least “through May 3rd,” according to its website.
The transition to virtual sales began soon thereafter. Meriwether described it as “very fluid,” since the bookstore already sells books online. That said, Harvard Book Store recently joined Bookshop, an online framework enabling independent booksellers to take advantage of e-commerce. Harvard Book Store will get 30 percent of every item sold through the service, according to Meriwether.
He said he has kept his whole staff, unlike many local businesses which have furloughed employees amid COVID-19-related economic plight, but has focused remote work on web orders. Meriwether likened the process to “training eight people to do what normally one person does.”
The book talks, which in the past have included figures such as Al Gore ’69 and Stephen King, have also moved entirely online.
“So suddenly, one of our event supervisors is hosting an event from her kitchen, as opposed to the third floor of the bookstore,” Meriwether said.
The bookstore held its first virtual talk on April 2, drawing over 600 attendees, according to Meriwether. He called it “an amazing response.”
The bookstore has yet to make a plan to virtually revive the Harvard Square Book Circle, an affiliated book club, but has introduced a virtual book recommendation service on its website.
“One of the special things about being a bookseller is being able to put the perfect book in someone’s hands when they come up to the information desk asking for recommendations,” Meriwether said.
Though he lamented the loss of that “person-to-person” interaction, Meriwether said the virtual service has since received “hundreds of inquiries.”
The store has seen an increase in web sales since the transition online. Despite the gloomy economic situation of many of Harvard Square’s businesses, Meriwether is optimistic about continuing business as usual — just virtually.
“None of this is stuff that we’ve never done before. It’s just doing things in a different way,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-three Harvard University Dining Services employees are at risk of going unpaid for the remainder of the school year because of a loophole in the compensation policies the University has instituted during the novel coronavirus pandemic, according to several affected employees and two representatives from their union.
The employees work in the dining halls that remain open, but are choosing to take sick or personal leave because they are in a high-risk group for COVID-19 or live with at-risk dependents. After their sick days and vacation time runs out — which, for at least one employee, will happen as early as Friday — they will go unpaid until the end of the semester, according to Aaron J. Duckett, a chief shop steward for their union, UNITE HERE Local 26.
Last month, the University announced it would pay through May 28 all Harvard employees who are able to work, but whose job duties stopped after campus closed due to the pandemic. The policy came as a relief to HUDS workers whose dining halls had shuttered for the semester, as they had previously only been promised pay for 30 days.
But it does not apply to those who work in Adams, Eliot, Kirkland, Lowell and Quincy dining halls, which remain open to serve the few undergraduates who remain on campus, or to those working in Cabot and Pforzheimer’s dining hall, which was repurposed to serve graduate students. The halls are serving exclusively bagged meals to comply with new Massachusetts rules prohibiting on-site food and beverage consumption.
Laquiesha N. Rainey, another Local 26 chief shop steward, said she believes the University should make an exception to this policy for at-risk individuals who have preexisting health conditions that prevent them from coming into work. She argued they should be guaranteed the same compensation benefits as other workers to “not have to worry about how to pay their bills or be able to take care of themselves.”
“Those people should be excused because you don’t want them to possibly get sick and bring it into the hall with them,” Rainey said.
Harvard’s enhanced workplace policies during the pandemic allow direct-hire employees to exceed their typical sick leave limits by 14 days. In addition to personal illness, the workers can now use paid sick leave “to meet self-isolation or quarantine requirements, or for the active care of others because of disruptions relating to COVID-19.” The additional days will be taken out of their sick time for next year, according to Rainey.
The University sent a March 24 letter describing the policy to employees who indicated they have an underlying health risk or are concerned about exposing dependents in a high-risk group.
“Employees who exhaust current sick time and the 14 unearned sick days will have the choice to use vacation or personal time to continue pay. Employees without vacation or personal time may go on an unpaid leave,” the letter obtained by The Crimson reads.
Duckett said in an interview that the policy leaves him concerned for the people who already used up most of their sick days each year due to a chronic or preexisting condition and will be unlikely to have many days left before going unpaid.
James C. Burdulis, a cook in Lowell House, is one of the 43 HUDS workers currently on sick leave. He said he broke two of his ribs earlier this year and used all his sick leave to recuperate. Though he is grateful for the 14-day loan, he feels forced to go back to work afterward because he cannot afford to stay home.
“I do plan on going back,” Burdulis said. “I don’t feel safe about it, but I don’t want to lose my job.”
Anabela A. Pappas, a dining worker at Cabot and Pforzheimer dining halls, said both she and her husband have taken sick leave after her doctor ordered them to stay home because she has Type 1 diabetes.
“He’s going to have to be forced to go back to work because we can’t afford it — that’s where we get scared,” Pappas said. “If he’s going to be forced to go back, it beats the purpose of being home.”
Her husband, Christopher M. Pappas, also works in the Cabot and Pforzheimier dining halls and said he plans to go on unpaid sick leave rather than return to work, as he does not want to endanger his wife by breaking their self-isolation.
“If this pandemic wasn’t going on, we wouldn’t be taking sick leave, we’d be working as normal,” Pappas said. “We feel that it’s unfortunate and unfair for us to have no other option but go out on sick leave where we’re going to use that sick time and we’re going to run out.”
He added he believes the University should provide dining employees in open facilities who have preexisting health conditions the same benefits as employees whose units have closed over the past weeks.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that University policies will continue to evolve in the coming weeks.
“We are committed to reviewing our human resources policies on an ongoing basis, with our first priority being the safety and wellbeing of each member of our community,” Swain wrote. “Over the past several weeks, the University has put in place enhancements to these policies, based on the needs of our workers and the best information we have available at the time.”
The letter the University sent to at-risk employees, meanwhile, notes that Harvard will review its sick leave policy at least every 30 days.
But for now, Duckett argued, the policy runs the risk of leaving HUDS’ most “high-risk” workers without pay simply because their dining hall happened to be selected to stay open.
“This is not the group of people that are going to go down to Market Basket and start working,” Duckett said. “In fact, if they weren’t at risk or high risk, they would just be in their dining hall working.”
“We just don’t want these people to slip through the cracks and not get paid, just simply in the name of the fact that their dining hall was open,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale discussed developments regarding the City’s emergency COVID-19 shelter and discouraged city councilors from closing several streets to vehicular traffic during Monday’s city council meeting.
The City Manager’s office announced Cambridge would open the War Memorial Recreation Center and Field House to shelter homeless people during the COVID-19 pandemic in a statement released last Wednesday. The War Memorial, which is part of the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School campus, will also serve as a temporary shelter for those who are unable to properly isolate or self-quarantine due to their housing arrangements.
According to the City Manager’s statement last week, the War Memorial is the “only existing site that meets both the physical space and activation time requirements needed” to effectively practice social distancing.
Guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Massachusetts State Government encourages people to stay at least six feet apart and avoid congregating in large groups — recommendations that are particularly challenging to follow in homeless shelters with limited space.
DePasquale informed city councilors that the city has created a webpage and a twenty-four hour hotline for the War Memorial shelter. He also thanked Harvard and MIT for their contributions toward the effort.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and DePasquale announced matching donations of $250,000 from each university on Monday afternoon. The funds will help cover costs associated with the creation of the shelter.
Cambridge Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. also spoke about additional measures the Cambridge Police Department is taking to prepare for the opening of the emergency shelter. Bard said he is instituting “neighborhood security twenty-four hours a day” around the shelter from a “dedicated group of officers” who serve in the family and social justice unit of the department.
"They're used to dealing with vulnerable populations and the same issues that may arise from the clientele that the temporary shelter,” he said.
Claude-Alix Jacobs, Chief Public Health Officer at Cambridge Health Alliance, said the shelter is “not yet ready for opening day” but will open by next week when the city has “all the protocols in place.”
Jacobs also said the city’s efforts to address the COVID-19 crisis coincide with National Public Health Week — an annual observance designed to highlight issues that are important to improving the public’s health.
“We typically have a display here in City Hall, we have signs on the front lawn, and we talk about this,” he said. “It's not a festive endeavor — by any stretch of the imagination — but just know that you have a strong team in place here to make sure that all those who live, learn, play, and pray here in the City are safe and protected.”
The City Council also discussed two policy orders which requested various Cambridge departments to determine the feasibility of closing Memorial Drive and other neighborhood streets to non-essential traffic. According to the policy orders, the closure of several streets would create more room for residents to go outside while maintaining social distancing practices.
Jacobs, DePasquale, and Bard discouraged city councilors from following through with the measures.
“This runs counter to what we have been recommending and proposing for weeks now,” Jacobs said. “Our sense is — that given that you close the streets — you run the risk of now having, in our opinion, de facto block parties,” he added.
During the meeting, Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80, who proposed the measure to potentially close Memorial Drive, said that she was “stunned” by this response.
“I would totally understand if we were telling people stay inside, this is a lockdown, but a shelter in place is a very different modality” Nolan said.
“It seems to me it's exactly now that it's essential we provide enough space for all residents of Cambridge to safely get outside for at least a few minutes a day,” she added.
Councilor E. Denise Simmons said that she was more inclined to support Jacobs, DePasquale, and Bard.
“As difficult an inconvenience it may seem, it's better for us to be inconvenienced for a moment than devastated for a lifetime,” Simmons said.
More than twenty residents offered their opinions of the measures during the public comments section of the meeting.
After more than an hour of debate, city councilors voted 5-4 to “table” the policy orders and discuss street closures at a later date. Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, Councilor Marc C. McGovern, Councilor Timothy J. Toomey Jr., Simmons, and Siddiqui voted in favor of tabling the amendment. Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, and Nolan voted against tabling the amendment.
