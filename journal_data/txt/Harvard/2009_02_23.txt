After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When asked by The Harvard Crimson about how students are doing, whether they have enough resources, and if they know where to go in order to get help, my initial reaction is that the paper doesn’t have enough space for a comprehensive answer.   
For a start, we have increased staff in Mental Health Service; revitalized the Bureau Study Counsel academic support services; developed an outstanding alcohol and other drug service; expanded the educational efforts of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Center for Wellness and Health Communication by welcoming them into the department of Behavioral Health and Academic Counsel; provided more education and support to residential staff; and worked to better coordinate all the programs in BHAC with the aim that students will be welcomed in any of our programs and directed to the most appropriate help. Without doubt, we are fortunate that our combined BHAC services are the best staffed, both in numbers and expertise, of any college in the country. Still, the efforts that mean the most to me are those that aim to increase student participation in promoting the well being of our community. 
Harvard College has a long tradition of student participation in promoting the emotional well-being of students. Room 13 was founded in the late 1960’s by Margie McKenna ’70, who is a psychiatrist at MHS. There are now five separate peer counseling programs, supervised by BSC and MHS staff. The student-run group, Mental Health Awareness and Advocacy Group, began 12 years ago. Now, we have the Community Health Initiative, Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Student Alliance and the Student Mental Health Liaisons, all dedicated to promoting student well being through education and advocacy. 
Several basic principles guide our efforts. First, we know from various surveys that students rely first on each other for help. But if students feel embarrassed or humiliated to share how they are feeling, they remain alone with their suffering. Second, many students are misinformed about the basic facts of emotional distress and the resources available to help them. Third, we all learn by example and students provide the most visible and meaningful examples for their friends and fellow students.  
The two pieces written by students on this page are wonderful examples of students sharing their experience and knowledge. Students lead by example when they speak without embarrassment about their treatment, or about feeling overwhelmed and finding help in conversations with friends and counselors. They teach us that emotional distress is common and remind us that we are more than a psychiatric diagnosis.  
Building on these principles, our effort is to develop a vibrant student partnership in order to create a caring community that recognizes friends in distress, supports them, and knows where to steer students for professional help. Thus far, the students’ participation has been impressive. For example, for the past three years, the Mental Health Awareness Week has been developed and implemented by students with support from UHS. Last year, we started a new student liaison group whose membership has grown to more than 20 students. One of the major sources of data about the attitudes of students regarding mental health services and the utilization of mental health services comes from Judy Herbstman ’07’s senior thesis. Each year for the past four years, Mental Health Advocacy and Awareness Group has sponsored small discussion groups and major guest speakers. Students are eager to serve as peer counselors and they provide a growing number of students with confidential peer support. 
Students are the experts about their lives and how they can live in college. We must rely on them to educate us and be our liaisons to the student community. We believe the more students are invested in the well being of the college community, the more students benefit. Fewer students suffer privately; fewer students feel ashamed to ask for help; and more students recognize that conversation with counselors or mental health staff improves their self esteem, lifts their mood, and reduces suffering. 
How are our students doing?  Most of our students—most of the time—are doing great. However, many students at times feel overwhelmed and need support. If our services continue to work collaboratively with students, most students will get the support they need. Every year I feel privileged and thankful to have the opportunity to work closely with our students, the College staff, and my colleagues in BHAC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students can be very tough on themselves. It concerns me that some carry a very narrow definition of success and others see asking for help as a sign of weakness. Years ago, freelance writer Linda Weltner shared the following story attributed to Norris Lee in The Boston Globe: 
A lecturer stands in the front of a class of overachievers, holding a 1-gallon wide-mouth mason jar. He fills it with good-size rocks, then asks the group, “Is this jar full?” The audience agrees that it is. 
“Oh, really?” he asks. He pours in several handfuls of gravel. “Is the jar full now?” The audience is doubtful. Probably not. He pours a handful of sand into the jar, filling it to the brim. “How about now?” he asks. Not yet. He pours in a pitcher of water. 
“OK,” he asks. “What’s the lesson to be learned here?” 
“Well,” says a man sitting near the front, “you’ve just demonstrated that no matter how full your schedule is, you can always fit more in.” 
“You’re absolutely wrong,” says the teacher. “The point I’m making is that if you don’t put the rocks in first, you’ll never get them all in.” 
This story says a lot about success. Harvard educators have more than education as a job; they must help students identify what the “rocks” in their world are at any point. By “rocks,” I mean the things a student wants to place high priority on when assessing progress made or distance still to go. Students want to be successful, but too often they see success in a limited way (for instance, a near flawless transcript) or they don’t really know what they are working toward.  
In high school, it was simpler. Students pushed to assemble records that would get them into top colleges. With tougher competition in college, it becomes more difficult to achieve the near flawless transcript. And, with many more post-graduate options, it is difficult to feel a clear sense of direction. 
In the past, when I have asked advisees what they want to be sure gets into the jar, or what they will use as a marker of success, they have thought hard. Some responses come to mind: I want to feel like I fit in personally and have one or two really good friends; I want to make strong progress in identifying a concentration; I want to interview my grandmother, whose health is failing, in order to begin to write a memoir. These responses have given the students a personal compass and a chance to look back at the end of the year with—more often than not—a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. That awareness has mattered hugely. 
My second concern is about the act of asking for help. Clarissa Pinkola Estes, a poet and psychoanalyst, made the following statement: “Asking the proper questions is the central action of transformation. Questions are the key that causes the secret doors of the psyche to swing open.” I know that it can be hard to ask questions or to acknowledge that you don’t have the answers that appear critical to move forward. But, it is important to remember that this is a complicated place and this is a complicated period of one’s development. We think more—not less—of students who ask questions and who take advantage of the myriad resources and support services here. Doing so suggests a kind of agency or taking charge that is both appropriate and applaudable and that contributes significantly to the achievement of success.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I don’t like being lost. I’m too nervous and too timid to appreciate the thrill of disorientation. When I returned to campus as a sophomore last fall, I reveled in the comfort of the familiar. I knew with confidence where each new step would take me, and when bewildered freshmen approached me for help, maps clutched to their chests, I gave them indulgent smiles and pointed them in the right direction. With amiable condescension, I’d watch them scuttle off to their next ice cream social in Ticknor, and feel relieved—I that I would never be that lost again.
Or so I thought. Just one month later, I was robbed of that confidence. Pressed to make some big decisions, I discovered I had no idea what I was doing, or where I was going. I felt stressed about grades, I was in all the wrong student groups, and I still didn’t know what I wanted to do in life. The feeling of this indecision—which I had been so comfortable with as a freshman—started to frighten me. Fear festered into unhappiness. All of a sudden, I was the one who was lost. I was the one who needed a map.
I was not alone in my struggle; mental health issues are far from uncommon on our campus. During the 2007-08 school year, 20 percent of Harvard undergraduates reported experiencing emotional distress. But its prevalence, however, does not make it easier to talk about. Depression is still an alienating experience; students who struggle with it often do so alone. Mental health problems continue to slip under the radar, because not all of us are comfortable speaking up about them. Too often, a student must reach a critical breaking  point—for example, failing in a class —before others realize that their friend needs help. Help is available at Harvard, but it takes courage to ask for it. In our fast-paced, competitive culture, it is hard to admit when we’ve lost our balance. If Harvard wants to make strides towards better mental health, we’ll need to make an institutional commitment to vigilance, and build a community that’s willing to listen.  But these changes should not be limited to the administrative and support functions of the University; in addition, we as students will need to remember that when we feel lost, it’s all right to ask for directions.
Harvard’s Task Force on General Education declared in its report in 2007 that “the aim of a liberal arts education is to unsettle presumptions, to defamiliarize the familiar, to disorient young people and to help them find ways to reorient themselves.” In and outside of the classroom, Harvard students are encouraged to explore the unexplored, to excavate the unfamiliar, and to learn in our wanderings through terra incognita just how limitless our learning can be.
The result is that a lot of the time, we feel off balance. As students, we’re entitled to feel uncertain, about what we know and what we want, but at the same time, it can make us feel anxious. At first, that sense of disorientation is fine––exhilarating, even. As a freshman, it was exciting to have preconceptions overturned, to wade through post modernist ambivalence for the first time, and to come out the other end with more tempered skepticism. It felt liberating to be “undecided”, not just about concentrations, but more broadly, about what I wanted to do in life. But by the end of last term, the impulse to reorient had already kicked in.  All of us face high expectations here—from our families, our professors, and most often ourselves–about what we should be doing at what time and where. In short, we cannot afford to be uncertain.
As students, we’re entitled to feel uncertain, about what we know and what we want, but at the same time, it can make us feel anxious. Soon, the impulse to reorient kicks in. All of us face high expectations here—from our families, our professors, and most often ourselves—about what we should be doing at what time and where. We cannot afford to be uncertain. As such, it shouldn’t be a surprise that many Harvard students struggle with mental health issues.  Ours is an unforgiving environment, even for the hardiest of minds. Our challenge is that we experience so much that is disorienting in our lives, in a culture that demands us to be goal-oriented. All these simultaneous pressures would be enough to make all of us fragile. For those who arrive at Harvard with mental health issues, or have other reasons to be vulnerable, our high-stress environment can only be exacerbates their deep set anxieties.
Sadness can be hard to articulate, too. Our task now should be to offer more channels for students to do just that. Last term, I didn’t realize I was depressed until I told someone I was. I felt estranged from friends and family. I worried all the time. I lost interest in activities I used to love, and started sleeping for longer and longer periods of time. Even then, I didn’t understand that I needed help until I said the words, “I’m unhappy,” and someone listened.
I wish now that I had the chance to reach out earlier. I was not alone in experiencing the so-called “sophomore slump”, and although Harvard recognizes the difficult transition students experience when they leaving the Yard, most sophomore advisers will focus their conversations on academics only. Mental health concerns remain unsolicited and unarticulated, locked under embarrassed reticence. While students can feel comfortable asking for advice about classes, an advising conversation might not seem like the right time to bring up depression.
We need to remember, however, that it is always the right time to speak up about mental health. We all have reasons to feel overwhelmed and unbalanced—it’s what our education is about—and to overcome these struggles, we must first name them. Four months after I first checked into Mental Health Services, I’m feeling happier. Like others, I took a difficult detour.  But I spoke up.  Someone listened.  And now, I’m heading in the right direction again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a place like Harvard, where the pressure to perform can seem overpowering, it is easy to feel alone.  Every day, we, like millions of other college students around the country, encounter challenges to our sense of self esteem and peace of mind, and we must find ways to overcome these obstacles.  Psychological research consistently tells us that one of the best ways to work through such difficulties is to share them—to talk it over with a friend or counselor or to simply ask for help when we feel overwhelmed.
This, however, is where the real challenge arises. Whenever or wherever it strikes, emotional distress has an uncanny ability to make us feel isolated, inadequate, and somehow weaker than other people.  Combine this feeling with the emphasis on self-sufficiency that is so common among Harvard students, and you have a recipe for silent suffering: not only do we feel like we have no recourse for help, but we feel ashamed to need that help in the first place.
At first glance, the mental health situation at Harvard can seem unsettling.  In a 2007 survey of student attitudes toward campus mental health services, 44 percent of polled students reported that they had felt like they needed mental health care at some point during the last year, but did not seek it.  The top three reasons for refraining included: negative expectations about the effects of assistance, feelings of being too busy to seek or receive care, and feelings of stigma or shame about needing help.  This statistic is unsettling for a number of reasons, but the most striking of these is its sheer magnitude.  A startlingly high percentage of students experience severe emotional distress and yet feel compelled to forgo professional help. 
Equally unsettling are the justifications that students offer for their decisions.  The truth is that the most common mental health problems faced by students are, in fact, highly treatable.  Moreover, in many cases there are multiple ways to address a given problem—meaning that treatment is also highly flexible and efficient.  Much of the stigma and shame that students feel when they struggle with emotional distress comes from the widely held belief that their experience is uncommon.  In reality, emotional distress is very common among college students, including those who go to Harvard.  In a recent survey of student well-being, 45 percent of Harvard students reported that, at some point during the last year, they had felt so depressed that they found it difficult to function in their day-to-day activities.
These findings are both troubling and informative.  Again we are confronted with the staggering number of students who experience severe, debilitating emotional distress at some point during their college years.  At the same time, however, this finding conveys an important message about the inconsistency of the culture of shame that often accompanies a student’s struggle with emotional distress at Harvard.  With almost half of the student body having experienced functionally significant depressive feelings, emotional distress is anything but uncommon and certainly not the result of personal weakness or inadequacy. 
Nevertheless, students often feel shame about seeking help.  While each person’s reasons for this feeling of shame may vary, it is likely that much of this stigma can be attributed to a general feeling that seeking professional help for issues related to mental health is uncommon at Harvard.  Once again, the numbers tell quite a different story.  By the time they graduate, 40 percent of Harvard students will have sought and received services from Mental Health Services or the Bureau of Study Counsel. And yet, students who are struggling with emotional distress or who are accessing services for the first time often feel terribly alone in their plight.
Rectifying this unfortunate situation is not as difficult as some might think. First, we can (and should) begin to break the silence that has stifled productive discussion of mental health issues within our community.  The aim of Mental Health Week is to share knowledge about issues of mental health, to stress the importance of students’ mental and emotional well-being, and to encourage students to reach out to friends in distress.  If real change is to be made, however, we must incorporate this same culture of open discussion and caring into the everyday fabric of Harvard life.
At a more tangible level, we can also work to simplify and ease the process of seeking help for students experiencing distress. Harvard provides by-appointment mental health services through UHS and the BSC, as well as 24-hour urgent care for students who need more immediate help than the appointment process can provide. In addition, students from Harvard’s peer counseling groups—Room 13, ECHO, Response, Contact, PCC—and the Student Mental Health Liaison program work to create a safe space for discussing mental health issues and can help students locate and access appropriate mental health resources and professional services.
As we look toward the future of mental health quality and care at Harvard, the vision is not one of despair but rather of hope. Of course, an unsettling percentage of our classmates experience severe emotional distress, and yes, a significant number of these students feel too ashamed to reach out for help. Yet by actively working to reduce the stigma surrounding issues of mental health, by looking out for signs of emotional distress in our friends, and by supporting efforts to increase the transparency and accessibility of campus mental health services, we each have the power to improve the state of mental health at Harvard. Together, we can make Harvard a place where each student feels empowered, safe, and, above all, valued as a member of our community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Obama’s announcement this weekend that his administration aims to cut the federal budget deficit in half by the end of his term may come as a surprise given the current economic crisis. Decreasing the current budget deficit, however, is important for the long-term health of the U.S. economy. The 2009 budget deficit is expected to reach $1.5 trillion—and cutting this in half by 2013 will be challenging. Still, it is heartening to see that, although the administration began its term by passing a $787 billion economic stimulus bill, it is making concrete plans that will benefit our country in both the short and long run.
On the heels of a massive economic recovery bill last week, Obama’s announcement that he will drastically cut the budget deficit over the course of his presidency seems highly difficult  to accept. Fortunately, the administration has made it clear that it has proposals on how to reduce the deficit, and we are hopeful that it can actually accomplish these promised cuts. Reducing the federal budget deficit is essential to maintaining a healthy economy in the long term.
The timing of this announcement may seem unwise in the midst of the current recession: Keynesian economics holds that the government should counter recessions with more, not less, spending. Given the sizeable federal spending that the administration has already approved, however, this announcement serves as a way to reassure the country that, despite the recession, the administration still has a long-term economic plan and is still committed to responsible fiscal policy.
It is also admirable that the Obama team has chosen to be more forthright than the previous administration when it comes to deficit accounting. The announced changes to budget deficit calculation—which will now include the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in addition to other previously hidden government spending—is certainly a step toward more transparent government. Their commitment to reducing the deficit in fact as well as on paper is essential to making real improvements in fiscal responsibility.
Maintaining a minimal budget deficit is essential in order to avoid saddling future generations with a hefty economic burden. On both sides of the political aisle, economists agree that maintaining a large federal budget deficit decreases national saving and lowers living standards in the long run. We cannot sustain deficits at 10 percent of GDP—as they are now—without significant consequences in the future.
Obama’s budget proposal, which he has stated will maintain commitments to health care, education, and energy, specifically, show that he is striving to maintain the priorities he set for his administration during his campaign. Going forward, however, he should be cautious in making too many conflicting promises that he might not be able to fulfill—particularly given changing economic realities since he began his campaign.
Overall, protecting our country’s long-term interests as well as its immediate future is a key responsibility of our politicians, and President Obama’s evident commitment to balancing these often-conflicting goals is commendable.

President Barack Obama often induces comparison to Abraham Lincoln. However, his recent announcement of a budget schedule that slices the deficit by one-half aligns him with a less celebrated commander-in-chief: Herbert Hoover.Hoover, the man whose infamous attempt to balance the budget in the face of skyrocketing unemployment and a deepening recession pushed the American economy over the edge into the Great Depression, is hardly a good example for our new president. Obama’s plans will not necessarily launch our economy into a depression.  He is attempting to slash the deficit, not eliminate it, and there are certainly wasteful government expenditures worth cutting.  However, it is important that Obama’s message to the American people is an unwavering pledge to end the economic plunge at all costs.Instead, this announcement sends mixed signals.  Obama recently signed a $787 billion stimulus package, the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, into law.  Tim Geithner just set out the skeleton for a plan to rescue the banking system that could cost up to $2.5 trillion.  Obama is also holding fast to his campaign promises to reform health care and education.  He has also highlighted Social Security as “the single most pressing fiscal challenge we face, by far.”  Obama is an intelligent man and a gifted leader, but accomplishing all of this spending while slashing the budget deficit without sending taxes through the roof will take a rather large feat of magic, not just determination and fiscal responsibility.Obama’s pledge points to either higher taxes down the road,or to broken promises.  Higher taxes during recessions only exacerbate the pain felt by Americans and slow down recovery.  The alternative, running a large deficit, is surely better than remaining in an economic downturn.  In many ways, the wasteful, destructive policies of the Bush administration that turned a budget surplus into the largest deficit since World War II have limited Obama’s options.  Eventually, he will have to take steps to cut the budget deficit.  However, a large deficit is much more harmful to an economy at full employment than it is to an economy with a gap between potential and actual production.  This compelled Obama to sign the stimulus into law.  But his bark must match his bite.  By mixing his messages, he casts doubt about his plans and his dedication to fixing the economy.The details of the budget don’t take into account the possibilities of other potential measures Obama might have to take to save the economy.  The current downturn was sparked by a bubble in house prices and the subprime mortgage crisis.  Some economists forecast another wave of bad news over the next three years, as option ARMs and Alt-A mortgages start resetting.  Other economists called for a larger stimulus package, and another might be needed in a couple of years.  By highlighting the goal of halving the deficit, Obama limits his ability to react to future crises.Obama’s economic policy, especially the stimulus package passed, shows a belief in the principles of Keynesian economics.  Maynard Keynes himself once suggested that, to battle the Great Depression, we bury money underground and hire workers to dig it out.  Hopefully, Obama’s policies to rejuvenate the economy are more useful than this, but his message should be closer to Keynes’s than to Hoover’s. Malcolm-Wiley T.

As part of his transition strategy, President Barack Obama introduced a web feature meant to symbolize his commitment to expanding the national conversation through the magic of Hope and Change. The feature, a component of the change.gov transition site called the “Citizen’s Briefing Book,” ultimately revealed that the “expertise and insight” that a large component of his web audience wished to share with the incoming president in this moment of crisis related to the need to legalize marijuana. Perhaps Obama overestimated the American public’s maturity. Over the past week, I’ve spent many potentially productive hours entranced by a website by the name “F*** My Life,” which may be found—for those willing to risk time better spent—at www.fmylife.com.Browsing through the site, one gets the impression that fmylife is much more emblematic of the national mood than whatever’s on offer at change.gov. The contents provide a disheartening image of the American psyche as a mental landscape whose anxiety cannot be assuaged by visions of hope and change but rather dwells upon the consequences of economic “structural adjustment.”Fmylife works by presenting an array of reader-submitted faux pas, each concluding with the initialism-exclamation “FML”, and allowing readers to vote on who “deserved” it and whose life is really “f***ed.”The top anecdotes tend to follow a certain pattern: a brief recount of one of life’s little disappointments, followed by a twist of the knife that makes it just that much worse. For instance, one classic submission reads, “Today, my girlfriend dumped me proclaiming she wanted someone more like her ‘Edward’. I asked her who Edward was. She held up a copy of her ‘Twilight’ book. She was talking about a fictional vampire. FML.”Unfortunately, few of the stories are so unambiguously amusing. A distressing number recount long periods of time in which the only person to contact the poster was his or her mother, clumsily discovered affairs, and the experience of getting laid off—often after having driven through a snowstorm to reach work on time. With consumer confidence plummeting after a month in which the U.S. lost nearly 600,000 jobs, this is a site for the recession.The site’s essence, then, lies in evoking the mindset of adolescence. Sometimes this is literal—a primary cause of angst on FML seems to be whether the writer’s “friends” are conspiring against him. More generally, though, adolescence tends to represent the stage in life in which one’s life is “f***ed” by social forces beyond one’s control, often represented by parents, teachers, or peer pressure. This feeling of adolescent helplessness is the analog for our current economic condition. As a teenager, one’s fundamental capabilities seem undefined and one’s independence constantly under threat. As we look ahead nationally to a period of economic reorganization—a slump to “grow out of”—America embodies the awkward maladjustment of the pimply ninth grader, but on a macroeconomic level.Reading about breakups via text message and unfortunate ways to find out that your mom is dating again may just be the perfect complement to a material world in which no employment relationship is safe, and your company may be flirting with setting up shop in China.The economist Joseph Schumpeter described economic growth under capitalism as a process of “creative destruction,” under which the old productive edifices are torn down in order to erect newer and more efficient modes of production. Few these days have the optimism to glimpse this creativity, however, within the current milieu. “We are all Keynesians now,” and the system is a heedless and uncontrollable beast, controlled by “animal spirits.” Logic and predictability have disappeared.So why not find solace in those little moments where failure comes in the form of a fictional vampire?Max J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At our new president’s behest, we have become a “service nation.” At least this appears to be the case from the effusive selflessness that has filled campus bulletin boards and open lists since the dawn of the new liberal epoch. With a shocking suddenness, the undergraduate gaze has swung from Manhattan penthouses to Mississippi shantytowns. City Year is now a more desirable employer than Citigroup. The increasingly social spirit of our generation is undoubtedly a good thing. But it is not nearly good enough.
Our newfound humanitarianism comes at a time when the deleterious effects of inequality and the destructive consequences of greed are coming into arrestingly sharp resolution. Economic and political configurations which seemed unshakable just a year ago have been laid low by the cumulative efforts of a class of well-educated buffoons. We could easily have been those buffoons had we been born just a few years earlier. Only recently have their mistakes become unmistakable.
Luckily for us, the social fashions shifted just in time. The grandees of the selfish class have been vilified and discredited. So, as selfishness collapses as a viable expression of young ambition, service has stepped in as a replacement. This is by no means a bad thing: the efforts of even a few service-minded young people will go a long way in repairing the acidic mistrust that has corroded the commonwealth.
Citizenship and service, however, are not coextensive. Service is an activity fraught with asymmetrical power relationships. As Harvard students, we can go paint community centers and tutor poor students and lobby for worker’s rights because we have the luxury of time and stability and because we are prodded along by the tickling guilt of our own comfort. This is not to undercut the work of the many students who participate in service, almost all with genuinely good motivations. Rather, it is to point out that we serve because we can, and we can because we are the beneficiaries of the same social lopsidedness which demands the service in the first place. 
Service is also hardly equivalent to genuine human decency—and it’s a lot easier. I much prefer the humane banker to the manipulative social worker. I have seen one student group whose members were so busy planning their high-minded service events that they left their own bridge housing rooms filthy for nameless custodians to tidy up. Maybe they were in a rush to go petition University Hall to offer custodians higher working wages. I bet those custodians wished that the students had just thrown away their trash instead.
Real humanity takes place in the practice of everyday life, in the fine textures of workaday relationships. It is awfully difficult. Service can’t be used to balance off an imagined moral ledger sheet or to cancel out privileges we feel bad about. Instead, we should try to avoid accumulating too much vulgar privilege in the first place—a quantity that isn’t measured in crude indexes like money or education or employment, but in the degree to which our social behavior trends either toward humility or toward hierarchism. 
Indeed, one of the most perverse consequences of an obsession with service is the wedge it drives between the servers and the served. In one particularly obtuse plan, the Obama administration intends to ensure that at least a quarter of federal work-study funds will support public service programs, “instead of jobs in dining halls and libraries.” That way, low-paid immigrants can take the dining-hall jobs from which the enlightened students have been liberated, and then the students can be paid to write policy papers and hold up posters in solidarity.
We need to get beyond service, not reject it. We need to embrace our commonality in a way that affirms our shared duties as participants in a democratic society, not in a society shorn between the helpful and the helpless. Ralph Waldo Emerson, speaking of the Young American, admitted that every society would have its group of talented and ambitious young people. He insisted, however, that their role was “not to drink wine and ride in a fine coach,” but rather to “adorn life for the multitude by forethought … by the remembrance of his humble old friend, by making his life secretly beautiful.”
I voted for this administration, and I believe in its vitality, its idealism, and its ambitions. I genuinely hope that its successes will be written into the history of our generation. But I hope that that will be a tale played out in the language of our common relationships, asserting the dignity and nobility of every member of society. Service is an urge which ought to hope for its own irrelevance, for if a truly equal society ever comes about, service will become happily obsolescent. We must thus act in the service of an equalitarian society, rather than in the service of an aristocratic charity to a pitied underclass.

In our consumer-driven culture, we define relationships with materialist symbols: saccharine cards on Valentine’s Day, long-stemmed roses on anniversaries, and diamond rings at engagements all serve as measures of our devotion to monogamy. However, with social-networking sites such as Facebook commanding an average of 20 minutes of our attention each day, a new standard of exclusivity is quickly divesting chocolates and perfumes of their primary significance. Forget meeting the parents: The ubiquitous Facebook “relationship status” now defines the seriousness of romance with a drop-down menu. We can be straightforwardly “single” or “in a relationship,” or more ambiguously define our love life as “it’s complicated.” Once ascertained, either alone or in tandem with a significant other, Facebook faithfully announces this romantic classification to hundreds of “friends,” many of whom are brief acquaintances or, at worst, complete strangers.With its unapologetic eschewal of nuance, Facebook pressures us to define our relationships and display the results for all to see. Yet relationships, like people, do not fit neatly into predefined categories. The premium that Facebook places on categorization has only exacerbated our societal obsession with affixing arbitrary labels to relationships and calculating our self-worth accordingly. For many women, “boyfriends” serve as status symbols, offering definitive proof of one’s capability to find a mate and achieve monogamous bliss; failure to assign that label can result in the abandonment of a healthy relationship for more “promising” prospects. This growing imperative to classify, and the anxiety over other peoples’ assumptions when that classification is inevitably removed, has changed the meaning of modern intimacy. Digesting complicated interpersonal interactions into broadcastable realities, virtual relationship statuses have come to define actual relationship statuses; indeed, the three words “in a relationship” have gained so much power that they can serve as the focal point of a breakup. In a testament to the definitive function of Facebook, the removal of that phrase often offers the final word, supplying undeniable proof that it is officially, and irreparably, over. Summing up the entirety of a relationship with a mockingly cliché broken-heart icon, Facebook forces this intensely private and vulnerable moment into the realm of public interrogation and imbues it with the disingenuous and impersonal tone of an e-mail. Although usually uttered in jest, the statement “it’s not real until it’s on Facebook” increasingly offers an accurate description of reality. Solidified in the digital universe, a committed relationship status serves as an explicit pledge of fidelity and a safeguard against unwanted come-ons. The relief of seeing those words in plain text promises to end the agonizing guessing game by confirming, beyond doubt, that the other person feels the same way. For some people, this declaration can become decidedly too real: Take the extreme example of the London resident who hacked his estranged wife to death with a meat cleaver last October after she changed her Facebook relationship status to “single.” Psychotic tendencies aside, this tragic case demonstrates the reality-making power of labels and begs the questions: What makes the online construction of a relationship status any less ephemeral or more valid than the online construction of a new, and inauthentic, persona? Since when did a relationship have to be publicly confirmed and classified in order for it to mean something? And what motivates our desire to define our relationship for everyone else—isn’t it enough for us to define our relationship with the only other person whom it concerns?Surely, proclaiming to the world that you care deeply about another person is not an action that warrants reproach. However, the transition from “single” to “in a relationship” on Facebook often stems from less-than-genuine sentiments, such as the desire to arouse jealousy in exes and single friends and the need for attention. Such motives, which would be decried as narcissistic in face-to-face conversation, somehow become socially acceptable when affirmed in the impersonal space of the Internet, where the safe barrier of the computer screen, and the absence of fact-checkers, separates the poster from the viewer and reality from fiction. The pervasive force of modern voyeurism—the fact that we can know intimate details about a person’s life and relationships without ever interacting with them, whether through Facebook, tabloids, or reality television—allows us to keep on looking, without examining the perverseness of transforming the act of viewing into a pleasure in and of itself. Against the atomized reality of individuals socializing through screens and in complete isolation, many still feel the need to classify their relationships based on our assumptions of how others will react—whether they be envious ex-boyfriends or childhood friends. The danger is that relationships, when placed on parade through the Internet, will become less about personal fulfillment and more about the perceptions and assumptions of others, a tendency that can cause an individual to lose both herself, and her relationship, in the process.For better or for worse, Facebook is a dating service. Yet, by transforming the relationship into a public status symbol, it has enabled us to forgo intimacy and vulnerability and has promoted the further fetishization of the labels “boyfriend” and “girlfriend.” We would all be wise to think carefully before assigning such definitive, and eminently public, definitions to our love lives.Courtney A.

Local patrons who order from the Harvard Book Store will now be brought their purchases by bicycle instead of truck, due to a recently-created “Green Delivery Service.” The two-week-old program is the result of a partnership with the Somerville-based Metro Pedal Power (MetroPed), a company that uses pedal-powered, three-wheeled vehicles to provide “eco-friendly pick-up and delivery services” to businesses and universities throughout the Boston area, according to its Web site.The service guarantees same- or next-day delivery for in-stock orders to Cambridge and parts of Somerville and Allston, and one-to-three day delivery to other areas in Boston. Heather L. Gain, marketing manager for Harvard Book Store, says that the partnership stemmed from the store’s effort to provide innovative services to the community.“We’re now able to provide faster delivery service, drop prices considerably, and have zero emissions,” Gain said.Deliveries—via MetroPed or otherwise—require a $5 flat fee plus $1 for each additional book, a rate reduced to make ordering books from home “more accessible,” Gain said. MetroPed owner Wenzday Jane said that from a customer’s vantage point, the delivery process remains exactly the same as using a traditional service. Every afternoon, a MetroPed “driver” stops at Harvard Book Store to pick up the orders—packed in repurposed shipping materials—and brings them to patrons. Jane said that the three-wheeled vehicles have a capacity of 650 pounds and are equipped with power assist to avoid getting stuck in snow banks. “We ride in all weather,” she said. Thirty green deliveries have already been made to individual residences, offices, and businesses since the partnership began, Gain said, adding that the response to the program has been positive.  “Cambridge is a very green-oriented community, so there has been an interest in Harvard Book Store to have greener practices,” Gain said. “I support it,” said Justin S. Ross, a Somerville resident and Harvard Book Store patron. “It sounds like an experiment, but one worth trying.”—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

The College’s second annual Mental Health Week kicked off at yesterday’s Undergraduate Council meeting as Paul Barreira, the director of behavioral health and academic counseling at Harvard University Health Services, discussed the resources available to students and fielded questions.“This isn’t for people who are mentally ill,” Barreira said. “This is for all of us and how we can grow as a caring and open community.”Throughout the week, titled “Speak Out: Mental at Harvard,” a series of events will aim to provide a forum to address student issues and raise awareness about mental health resources, said Tamar Holoshitz ’10, Student Affairs Committee chair and one of the primary organizers of both last year’s and this year’s events. The week is also focused on gathering suggestions from the student community for improvement of mental health resources and their accessibility, she said. “The week has two objectives—one is to raise awareness and the second is to create a dialogue that allows people to really speak up about their concerns,” Holoshitz said.The week is co-sponsored by a number of other student groups, including the Mental Health Awareness and Advocacy Group, the student mental health liaisons, Community Health Initiative, and Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors.“It affects every single student on this campus,” said Andrea R. Flores ’10, UC president. “The main issue with mental health is getting people comfortable with seeking out resources.”Two years ago, the mental health-focused events took place throughout April, which was designated “Mental Health Awareness Month.” Last spring was the first year the events occurred within the span of a week. Lianna E. Karp ’10, a student mental health liaison and co-chair of MHAAG, said that it is often difficult for students to tell others when they need help with a mental health issue. “I’m not sure if [mental health at Harvard] is overlooked. The better word for it is that students sometimes just don’t feel comfortable with it,” Karp said. “Because it’s Harvard there’s a lot of pressure on everyone to be perfect.”Barreira also discussed future initiatives geared towards freshmen, referencing plans to interface with Peer Advising Fellows. “The data shows that freshman year is one of the hardest transitions during a student’s four years at Harvard,” he said.­—Staff writer Eric P.

Students, professors, and community members paid tribute to civil rights leader and Harvard Law School alum Charles Hamilton Houston at a stamp commemoration event and panel discussion Saturday afternoon.Hosted by the Cambridge Post Office, the occasion marked the release of the Civil Rights Pioneers stamp sheet—a series designed to commemorate the achievements of 12 prominent civil rights figures including Houston, who led the legal battle against racially discriminatory laws in the mid-20th century.     “Stamps can start conversations, help share dreams, memories—and challenge us to reflect and remember those who have sacrificed so much to help make this nation live up to its promise,” said Katherine Lydon, the postmaster of the Cambridge Post Office.Issued by the United States Postal Service, the new stamp series pays homage to such civil rights giants as Oswald Garrison Villard, one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and assassinated NAACP official Medgar W. Evers in addition to Houston.Though a more general release celebration occurred in New York City, Saturday’s Cambridge event, held in the Zero Arrow Theatre, focused specifically on Law School graduate Houston. Born in 1895, Houston served as the NAACP Litigation Director, pioneering a novel legal strategy for confronting the institionalized racism of the United States’ Jim Crow Laws. As dean of Howard University Law School, Houston trained a generation of young black lawyers, including future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.In 2005, HLS established the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice to honor the great civil rights leaders of the 20th century. The Institute’s founder, Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., and Houston’s son, Charles Hamilton Houston, Jr., were both in attendance at Saturday’s event. “The Institute embodies my father’s ideals by continuing his fight for social justice,” Houston said.—Staff writer Courtney P.

The Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School announced a new fellowship position last week that will be funded by Cooley Godward Kronish, a technology-focused law firm. The fellowship will be aimed at establishing a closer link between the organizations. The clinic—part of the Law School’s Berkman Center for Internet & Society—defends anonymous online posters against legal demands for their identities, negotiates online music and software licensing agreements, and explores issues such as internet surveillance and the influence of the internet on democracy, according to its director, Phillip R. Malone ’81.Cooley, Godward, and Kronish is an national law firm that specializes in technology law and has an office in Boston. The new fellowship will provide of financial support for one of two fellows already working in the clinic, who will become the Cooley Cyberlaw Clinic Fellow, according to Malone.The position will also provide closer collaboration with the Cooley firm, which Malone said will allow the clinic to draw on the large firm’s expertise and resources.John G. Palfrey ’94, a Law School professor who formerly oversaw the Clinic, called the fellowship a “major step forward for the study of cyberlaw at Harvard Law School” and said the relationship with Cooley—“a leader in intellectual property law”—would be a boon for the Clinic. Current fellows have proven immensely helpful to students, according to Tom B. Sullivan, a student at the Law School, who worked at the clinic in 2008 and remains affiliated with the Berkman Center. Sullivan called his interactions with the fellows a “chance to get actual experience, and to be able to encounter problems you don’t encounter in the classroom.”

The Institute of Politics Director’s Internship Program anticipates that a record 375 students will apply to this year’s program, marking a 50 percent increase over last year. The program—which celebrates its 15th Anniversary this year—has increased the number of internships to 51 from 40 and has also increased the stipend awarded to $4,000 from an average of $3,500.
“This is certainly a record turnout,” said Amy Howell, the internship program administrator at the IOP.
The Director’s Internship Program provides paid six to ten-week summer internships for Harvard undergraduates at domestic and international political or public service organizations.
This year’s expansion amounts roughly to a 40 percent budget increase at a time when other Harvard programs and departments are slashing costs. But IOP officials said that they believed the program would remain at its current size next year due to financial considerations.
“It’s something that provides the opportunities for young people that we are striving to offer: interactions with people and public service,” said Esten Perez, director of communications for the IOP. “It is certainly a priority for us and we will maintain strong funding for it going forward.”
In addition, the stipend increase will apply across the board to all internship locations, while in past years more expensive cities would receive higher than average stipends to compensate for the higher cost of living. 
“Regardless of whether you’re in New York, Portsmouth, N.H. or Rome, Italy, everyone will be receiving a $4000 stipend,” said Howell.
Although the decision to increase the stipend amount and the number of internships was made long before the global financial crisis hit its peak this year, the rise in the applicant pool likely reflects student demand for stable, paying internships in a difficult job market.
“A lot of [other] internship opportunities require reaching out to multiple different groups,” said Amy M. Beeson ’10, who applied for an IOP internship at the World Health Organization. “It’s really nice to be able to do it all with one very concise application.”
But the increase in applications also corresponds to the program’s expansion of its internship offerings which included new placements at Google, Facebook, and Politico as well as five new programs in the area of environmental sustainability.
“We’re pleased every year when we receive a strong number of applications,” said Perez. “I think it’s a testament to the great opportunities we’re offering.”  
New internships are typically created by reaching out to former IOP fellows as well as other IOP alumni. 
“Each year, we review the placements and talk to the students,” said IOP Director Bill P. Purcell. “We tend to add new placements based on student interest and availability.”

The Committee on College Life discussed a report on student life drafted by University officials on Wednesday, in preparation for this year’s formal review of Harvard’s academic and institutional standards. The review marks an important step in Harvard’s bid to renew its accreditation—the national certification of the University’s curricular standards issued each decade.Wednesday’s meeting provided student and administrative representatives their first opportunity to put their stamp on the report, whose initial draft was assembled primarily through the use of institutional data. Harvard officials have relied on student survey responses, faculty and staff committee reports, and the findings of such special teams as the President’s Task Force on the Arts to piece together the initial draft of the report for review. The use of concrete source materials was necessary to create a draft that met the New England Association of Schools and College’s formatting requirements, according to Assistant Dean of Harvard College Courtney B. Lamberth, whose office had a substantial role in preparing the report.“Now we are in an active review period where we are seeking input from students, faculty, and staff to ensure that the self-study accurately reflects the community’s experience,” Dean Lamberth wrote in an e-mail after the meeting. One concern raised by student representatives at Wednesday’s meeting was whether the report—which makes no mention of social organizations like final clubs and sororities—captures the tendency of extracurricular and social life on campus to bleed together.But Lamberth pointed out in her e-mail that the reaccredidation standards do not inquire about social life, and that the University’s report is “bound by [the] NEASC to adhere closely to the standards.”The report addressed at Wednesday’s meeting was focused specifically on standards for admissions, undergraduate retention, and student services that the University must meet. It will eventually become a component of a larger report that Harvard will submit to NEASC in August.The University last underwent the accreditation in 1997. A special two-year extension was obtained for the original 2007 reaccreditation deadline, because Harvard had not yet completed its search for a new University president. Dean Lamberth wrote in an e-mail that the suggestions at Wednesday’s meeting “very helpful, adding that “the revised draft will reflect the feedback we received.”The reaccreditation process will culminate Oct. 18 through 21, when a NEASC delegation, headed by Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia, will visit campus. —Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.

There was a time when Sangu J. Delle ’10 seemed to have the job market in the palm of his hand.The high-profile Delle, who serves as president of the Black Men’s Forum, spent his first two summers as a college student working at prominent financial firms. As a freshman, Bear Stearns came calling. Goldman Sachs took him on as a sophomore. And those were not his only choices.But in the face of the most disastrous financial downturn since the Great Depression, times have changed, Delle said, and so has his grip on the job market. “Last year I had offers from everywhere, from Merrill Lynch to Bear Stearns to Morgan Stanley, he said. “Half these firms don’t exist anymore—the offer letters I have now are historical documents.”  Delle’s plight is hardly unique. This year, hundreds of Harvard students hoping to enter the finance industry are facing the most difficult career and internship marketplace in decades, as the firms remaining on Wall St. are shrinking their workforce and turning away even the most qualified applicants. Signs of the new crunch are not hard to come by, especially for young job-hunters immersed in the recruiting process.Kayley E. Laren ’09, the chief investment officer for Smart Women Securities—a student group dedicated to investment education—said that many firms are not looking to hire much beyond the size of their summer class.“There are far fewer firms that are in the career pool because of bankruptcies and acquisitions,” she said. “Frankly, if you’re just looking at a numbers game, it’s frightening.”While she was applying through the Office of Career Services’s e-Recruiting system, Laren noted far fewer interview slots this year. She also said that offers were coming much later than in previous years because of market volatility and uncertainty about government intervention.Judging the student concerns about the job market, she said that most student groups related to finance and consulting have “taken a hit” in recent months. According to Laren, Smart Woman Securities had experienced a drop in both new and returning membership relative to previous years.Students and career counselors have both been looking for ways to cope with the financial landscape’s sharp new contours. After three major investment banks folded in the last year, students have expressed increased interest in smaller boutique firms, that have suffered less in the face of market volatility. Harvard’s Office of Career Services began offering special information sessions called “Boutique Nights,” in response to increased student demand.Stephen M. Marks ‘06, an analyst at the New York boutique firm Greenhill & Company who has interviewed students at Harvard and Princeton, said that summer applications to his company from Harvard students had nearly doubled this year.Marks, who is also a former Crimson managing editor, added that part of the uptick could have been due simply to increased recruiting efforts by the firm.Besides looking at smaller companies, students also appear to be more receptive to far-flung locales in their job searches.Elena D. Butler ’10 said that traditionally unpalatable cities were coming into play more than in times past.“I definitely have been surprised at how many of my friends who were focused on staying in New York or Boston are now willing to take a job elsewhere after graduation,” she said.Butler, who has interviewed with companies in both finance and consulting, said that although she thinks of herself as a calm person, the process of finding a summer internship has caused her to be “much more stressed out than she has been in a long time.”But Delle, despite his difficulties this year, said he saw the situation somewhat differently, offering an optimistic perspective on the current job market. “For people who were following the crowd into finance, it’s time to follow your passions,” Delle said. “In these markets where job security is almost an oxymoron, you want to do what you love.”—Staff writer Victor W.

Students who once had to travel out of state to catch a Southwest Airlines flight are in luck—the airline announced last Thursday that it would begin flying out of Boston Logan International Airport this fall. Currently, students who fly Southwest must travel to either Manchester, N.H. or Providence, R.I. for service.“I’m really happy to go from Logan directly rather than going up to Manchester,” said Samuel B. Novey ’11. “It will be a lot easier to go home.”Veronica J. Shi ’11 said she prefers Southwest because “they usually have cheaper nonstop flights compared to other airlines.” “I would be able to have the convenience and proximity of Logan Airport, as well as the economical prices of Southwest,” she said.Last year, a free shuttle between Logan and Manchester-Boston Regional airport was discontinued in favor of one that charged $19 each way, increasing overall transportation costs.“Now that there is no longer a free shuttle, it’s a lot more of a hassle to get to Manchester,” Shi said.Southwest Airlines Spokesman Brad Hawkins said that airfares will remain comparable when service begins at Logan in the fall.He said that Southwest is able to begin the two-gate operation in Boston because of an effort to optimize use of available airplanes.“We now have the capacity to fly out of Boston,” said Hawkins.Hawkins said the company is not worried about competition from other low-fare carriers like JetBlue Airways and AirTran Airways.“We offer very different products and even different destinations,” Hawkins said.Southwest has not yet announced specific service details, saying only that it will offer a “conservative number of flights” in a press release announcing the change.The Dallas-based company has been serving both Manchester-Boston and TF Green Airport in Providence for over a decade. It currently operates in 64 cities across 32 states with 3,200 flights a day.

Spring may not be in the air quite yet, but this weekend still marked the start of the season for Harvard’s women’s lacrosse team. After compiling a 9-7 record last season—its best since 1994—the Crimson (1-0), making its earliest start in program history, came out strong.“It was great starting a week earlier this year,” senior attack Kaitlin Martin said.  “Getting another game under our belt before going into the league games will be beneficial.”Harvard once again opened its season against Holy Cross (1-1) Saturday afternoon in Worcester, Mass., beating the Crusaders, 13-10. This was the Crimson’s fifth-straight win against Holy Cross. “It felt amazing to finally get to play,” Martin said. “We’ve been practicing hard all fall and have had a tough preseason the past three weeks.”Last season, the Crimson met the Crusaders in its season opener and flew through the game, earning a 19-2 win. Sophomore Jess Halpern showed no mercy on Holy Cross for the second year running. Last year, Halpern made her collegiate debut with four goals against the Crusaders, and came back this year to score a career-high six goals, all of which were unassisted, this time around.“Jess was driving all game,” junior tri-captain Sara Flood said. “She was taking on people left and right, really dominating the entire time.”Halpern scored the first two goals of the game, and freshman Katie Doherty put another tally on the scoreboard with 17:41 left in the first half, putting Harvard up, 3-0.  Minutes later, Holy Cross midfielder Megan Fenton put up a goal for the Crusaders, only to be answered by another pair of Halpern goals, bringing the score to 5-1. But Holy Cross didn’t surrender, and managed to put up three goals in the final three minutes of the half, tightening the score at 5-4. The Crimson came out strong in the second half, adding a goal from Martin in the first 30 seconds. Not long after, the Crusaders found their rhythm and put two more goals in the back of the net, tying the game up at 6-6.After Harvard’s short setback, Martin and Doherty teamed up to get the Crimson back in the game, putting up four quick goals for Harvard.  Martin tallied the first and third of the series unassisted, and Doherty scored first from a free position shot and then off a pass from Martin.“[Doherty] stepped it up in this game,” Flood said. “She really proved herself today.”With only 6:45 remaining in the game, Holy Cross managed to get within two.  But, after another goal from Halpern, Harvard sealed its victory against its hometown rival, with the final score 13-10.Fenton led the Crusaders with a career-high five goals, and also added an assist.In the net was freshman Kerry Clark, making nine saves to record her first win of her collegiate career. Clark and her classmates impressed the team with their collective quick adjustment to the high level of play in collegiate lacrosse.  “Coach [Lisa Miller] told them from the beginning that they don’t have time to be freshmen,” Flood said. “With such a large amount of rookies on the team, they had to step it up right away, and that’s exactly what they did.”Harvard has welcomed ten new players, including nine freshmen and former Crimson tennis player Catriona Stewart, and has returned ten players from last season. Six of those freshmen—Clark, Doherty, Kathryn Sall, Tyler Petropolous, Chelsey Bowman, and Ellen Gleason—started in their collegiate debut, and Lauren Ianni also saw playing time.  “We feel prepared coming into the season,” said Flood. “We had a such good season last year, and now we can build off of that.” Harvard has its first home game of the season against Massachusetts on Saturday on Cumnock Turf at 1 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Searching for its first road victory of the season, Harvard (7-14-6, 7-7-6 ECAC) traveled to St. Lawrence (17-11-4, 9-7-4) and escaped with a 2-2 tie. Junior Doug Rogers scored twice, sophomore goalie Ryan Carroll had a solid performance between the pipes, and the Crimson gained a critical point in the ECAC standings. 
“It was a pretty hard-fought game,” Rogers said. “They are pretty tough to play on their home rink, but I thought we played with a lot of intensity, and I’m glad we were able to pull off a tie.” 
The Saints held a 39-29 shooting advantage, but were 0-for-4 on power plays, extending Harvard’s streak of successful penalty kills to 20.  The Crimson was 0-for-5 on the man advantage.  
“Obviously we want to limit more shots,” Carroll said. “When you give up that many shots, it’s hard to come away with the win this late in the season.”
Harvard came out with energy and applied pressure early against St. Lawrence. At the 12:58 mark of the first period, junior Alex Biega’s long pass to center ice found freshman Eric Kroshus, who tapped it to sophomore Mike Biega.  Biega found Rogers skating up the right side, and Rogers carried the puck wide and slipped a shot between the legs of Saints goaltender Alex Petizian for a 1-0 lead.  
St. Lawrence committed a penalty at 16:11, putting itself in a shorthanded situation. 
On the power play, the Crimson made a break towards goal, but Saints player Kevin DeVergilio intercepted a pass and sped down ice. 
He forced a shot from the left circle which made it past Carroll with about two minutes before intermission. 
Harvard got the first power play in the second period, but St. Lawrence nearly scored another shorthanded goal.  After a turnover forced by a Saints forecheck, St. Lawrence broke down ice, but shot wide from the slot.
Carroll preserved the tie with a stunning left-pad save in the 12th minute after a Saints player found a hole in front of the goal.  St. Lawrence kept the Crimson off-balance, and they took a 2-1 lead at 17:12 when Jeremiah Cunningham tapped in a rebound on a fast break. 
Soon after the Saints took the lead, St. Lawrence gave Harvard a two-man advantage for the remainder of the period. The Crimson took five shots on goal, but to no avail. The Saints maintained the lead at the second intermission and established a 10-7 shot advantage in the frame.  
Rogers offered the equalizer only 2:49 into the third period.  
He intercepted a pass at the St. Lawrence blue line, passed to Mike Biega, and dashed away to the slot.  He received a quick pass from Biega and put it past Petizian for the 2-2 tie.  
Carroll took charge for the remainder of the period, getting his right pad on an attempt from point-blank range. 
He later dove right and gloved a St. Lawrence shot. Soon after that save, a puck hit Carroll and got behind him, but he stopped it short of the goal line. 
“I think the team played pretty well,” Carroll said. “It’s hard to play on the road up there.  We showed in the third period we can compete. We just need to compete like that for the full 60 minutes.”
Harvard was able to kill a Saints power play in the waning minutes of regulation, and nearly stole a win when senior Nick Coskren’s shot was deflected into the protective netting.  
St. Lawrence had three of the four shots on goal in an end-to-end overtime, but Carroll maintained his resolve and helped Harvard capture the point.  
“This is another step in the right direction,” Rogers said. “We have to focus for the entire game and peak right around playoff time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s an old adage that goes, “a tie is like kissing your sister.” For the Harvard men’s hockey team, which earned a draw against Clarkson (9-16-7, 7-9-4 ECAC) Saturday, tying was more desirable than one might expect. After facing a two-goal deficit in the second period and being one score behind in the third, the Crimson (7-14-6, 7-7-6) surged back and snuck away with a 3-3 tie against the Golden Knights. The point against Clarkson, in conjunction with the point earned against No. 20 St. Lawrence on Friday, gives Harvard sole possession of sixth place in the ECAC standings and a shot at earning a first-round bye in the ECAC playoffs. “Judging how the games went, we’re pretty content with the result,” junior Doug Rogers said. “We showed this weekend we can come back when behind, which is crucial going into the playoffs.”In the first period, Clarkson came out of the gates quickly. Just 4:29 into the contest, Golden Knight Matt Beca slotted the puck past sophomore goaltender Ryan Carroll. Clarkson controlled the first period, outshooting the Crimson 12-6.Three minutes into the second frame, Harvard was whistled for boarding. The Golden Knights took advantage when Shea Guthrie deflected a shot into the net to give his team a two-goal cushion.The power-play goal broke the Crimson’s streak of 20 straight penalty kills. “I feel pretty comfortable [when we’re a man down],” Carroll said. “The guys in front of me know what they’re doing. Everyone has confidence that we’re going to kill the penalty.”In the middle of the second frame, Harvard started its comeback. Skating four-on-four, sophomore Mike Biega ripped a shot, but was thwarted by Clarkson goaltender Richie LaVeau. Junior Doug Rogers, in the right place at the right time, drilled home the rebound to cut the deficit to one. Rogers’s three weekend goals vaulted him into first place on the Crimson with 19 points this season. With 2:03 left in the period, freshman Alex Killorn notched the game-tying goal on a power play. Using senior Nick Coskren’s screen, the first-year snapped a shot past the skate of a distracted LaVeau.Harvard kept up the pressure in the third, but was the victim of a counterattack early in the period. After a series of Crimson attempts on goal, the Golden Knights gained control of the puck and quickly skated across the ice. Beca found space and sent the puck towards goal, but was denied by Carroll. Beca went after the rebound and struck it home to give Clarkson a 3-2 advantage. Harvard answered eight minutes later with a counterattack of its own. The rush began when junior Alex Biega dropped to the ice to block a Golden Knight pass. After the Crimson secured possession and made a couple of quick passes, freshman Daniel Moriarty centered the puck to sophomore defenseman Chris Huxley. Huxley wristed a shot past LaVeau to even the score. Despite several chances, neither team could register the game-winner at the end of regulation or in overtime.  After the game, Clarkson assistant coach Jean-Francois Houle expressed to an ECAC hockey reporter that he was disappointed with the result. Houle felt the Golden Knights outplayed Harvard at full strength.“I could see where he’s coming from,” Rogers said. “In the first period they definitely controlled the play. [But] the momentum really shifted and I thought we took over the second half more so than they did.” On Friday, the Crimson struggled on special teams, going 0-5 when up a man. But Harvard was perfect with a man-advantage on Saturday, scoring two power-play goals. “After the St. Lawrence game, we watched some video and addressed some of the things we need to do better, such as moving the puck more,” Rogers said. “We came out against Clarkson and did that. We identified where their penalty kill broke down and went at them.”Although Clarkson ranks below the Crimson in the league standings, the tie seems to be a confidence booster. Harvard has struggled mightily on the road this year, compiling a record of 0-11-5. The Crimson values all points it can muster away from home.  “I just think we have to realize that you have to play a simpler game on the road in order to win,” Rogers said. “I think we made strides toward that this weekend.”The tie puts Harvard two points behind Dartmouth and St. Lawrence for fourth-place in the ECAC.This weekend, the Crimson will face seventh-place Quinnipiac and second-place Princeton at home, where the team is 7-1-1 in league play. Harvard is unbeaten in its last four home contests.“I think the team is just coming together and is working on the same page,” Carroll said. “It’s crucial for us to win both games this weekend.”Two wins could give the Crimson a bye in the first round of the playoffs, which start in two weeks. —Staff writer Jake I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—With the score knotted at 58-58, Harvard took possession with just over 50 seconds left. Senior guard Drew Housman, who had carried the team with his season-high 22 points, cut into the lane. Penn’s defense converged on him, forcing him to kick the ball out to the top of the key, where junior guard Jeremy Lin was waiting to take the shot.“We were basically running a high pick and roll,” Housman said. “Coach [Tommy Amaker] put the ball in my hands and allowed me the freedom to try and make a play. I turned the corner and Jeremy was wide open.”Despite struggling with a severe ankle injury the entire game, Lin was still out there, and when the ball came to him, he rose up and let it fly.The drama riding on this one shot was palpable. Harvard had not won at the Palestra since the 1990-’91 season, the team was in danger of sliding closer to the bottom of the Ivy League standings with a loss, and Lin was taking the shot off one good leg.But the shot ripped through the net, propelling the Crimson to a huge 66-60 win over Penn Saturday night.Behind Housman’s staggering performance and Lin’s clutch shot, the Crimson not only broke its long losing streak at the Palestra, but in addition, the team was finally able to finish off a close Ivy game with a win.“Maybe it is not that big in the whole scheme of things this season but it is good for the program as a whole,” Housman said. “We have not [won at the Palestra] in so long.”While Lin’s shot was the clincher, the plays leading up to it were all the more telling for a Harvard squad, which has struggled in late-game situations this year.After senior forward Evan Harris fouled out with just over 11 minutes to play, the team was forced to play under-manned from there on out. With the only other viable big man for the Crimson, freshman Keith Wright, sitting on the bench with four fouls of his own, Harvard turned to oft-used reserve freshman Peter Swiatek for minutes. The Crimson struggled on the defensive end, as Swiatek could not control the Penn big men down low. This opened up the three-point line for Penn, and senior Kevin Egee delivered, knocking down three threes in the course of three minutes to bring Penn to within two at 46-44 with 7:50 to play.“Evan with four fouls, Keith with four fouls and then Evan fouling out, we’re just trying to massage it as much as we could and hold on,” Amaker said.But the Crimson battled back—by playing ugly. The team made its free throws, Penn did not, and the team stayed intense and tough. This was none the more obvious than in Lin’s performance, as the junior standout battled to an amazing 12 points despite a serious ankle injury, which forced him to hobble at every dead ball.And on top of that, the Crimson was holding an ace in the hole—Housman. The guard lit up the Penn defense for 22 huge points on top of five assists, going 8-12 from the floor.“Everything becomes much more critical because you don’t have the one or two guys that can make the plays [for Penn] consistently in tough situations,” Quakers coach Glen Miller said. “Housman is a senior and had 22 points, he controlled a lot of what Harvard did. I thought he was a real key to the game.”But the point that mattered the most was his last.Housman went to the line, with the Crimson down one, 55-56. In the strangest of series, Housman made the first, but his second went straight off the back of the rim, floated high, and landed right in the hands of senior Andrew Pusar. After another miss and another offensive board, the ball was kicked out to Housman, who held the ball, staring at the clock. He waited until there were just under 20 seconds left on the shot clock, then faked right, spun left, and cut to the corner.The Quakers expected a drive, but Housman stopped and pulled back for a jumper that rattled around and fell in the net, as he careened to the floor.With Lin injured, Housman knew he had to step up, and with shots like that, he did.“I heard earlier in the day [Lin] was not going to play,” Housman said. “I knew at that point I was going to have to step up, especially offensively because we would be lacking so much.”Lin tallied zero points in the first half, but even so, the Crimson held a 29-26 lead at the break, thanks to 11 points from Wright. It all changed in the second, however, as the Crimson lost Wright for much of the frame due to foul trouble. In the process, it lost its low-post dominance as well.It cam down to Housman and one clutch shot from the Crimson’s most clutch player, Lin, to put the team over the top.“Especially us seniors, we’re going to put everything out there,” Housman said, following the team’s 58-55 loss to Princeton the night before.In carrying his team to victory, Housman did just that.—Staff writer Walter E.

PHILADELPHIA—In trying to grab its first win at the Palestra since 1991—also the last time Harvard got a victory on the tough Princeton-Penn road trip—the Harvard men’s basketball team needed to correct the mistakes that contributed to its murky past on the “Killer P’s” road trip. The Crimson took advantage of many of the little things that had gone against it in its loss at Princeton the previous night as well as its 66-60 loss at home to the Quakers earlier this month to win by the same score.With Penn, hampered by a mix of failing to get loose balls and poor free throw shooting in those losses, the tables were turned on Saturday.Harvard shot just 7-of-16 from the foul line in the earlier fixture, but this time, Penn was just 14-of-25. While the Crimson got unlucky bounces on balls in those other losses, this time, after senior guard Drew Housman made the first free throw to tie the game at 56-56 with 2:16 left, the second went off the rim and straight to captain guard Andrew Pusar on the block. One minute and one more offensive rebound later, the team was on top.Then, after the Quakers tied it up, junior guard Jeremy Lin led a break up the court, but his intended pass for Pusar was blocked by Penn defenders. But Pusar was first to the ball again. With a three-point lead after Lin’s three, the Crimson gave nothing away at the foul line. Pusar hit one of two, but after a Penn hoop with 15 ticks made it 62-60, Lin would hit all four of his foul shots over two trips and the team would take a deserved-late game victory.“These are life lessons, you can deserve something sometimes and not get it,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought in my heart we deserved it.”THE WRIGHT STUFFWith the frontcourt decimated by injuries coming into the game and Lin hobbled by a hurt ankle, the rest of the team had to step up. One player who did so in a big way was freshman forward Keith Wright. The big man followed a fine performance Friday with 13 points and a team-best seven rebounds. 11 of his baskets came in the first half, where he routinely posted up the Penn defenders and led his team to a 29-26 halftime lead.“Coach kept telling me to post up hard, so that’s what I do,” Wright said. “The guards tell me they are going to look inside-out so they pass the ball in to me and trust me to make the smart play, the right play.”The best defense against him was foul trouble. He picked up his third foul three minutes into the second half and stayed on the floor to get his fourth a minute-and-a-half later while trying to receive a pass. But senior Evan Harris fouled out soon and freshman reserve Peter Swiatek, who played just four minutes in the Ivy season so far, had trouble against the impressive Quaker frontline, as he picked up four fouls in seven minutes. So Wright came back for good with just under 10 minutes left and played most of the rest of the game, with just a few breaks here and there.“Not everything is going to go our way in the game,” he said. “Coach tells us all the time and next play we got to keep our head up. We knew we had to play smart but we also had to still play hard. I went in with my fourth foul and coach told me to play hard, play my game.”The fifth foul never came and Wright got another bucket with a nice spin on Penn forward Cameron Lewis to pull his team within one at 53-52 with five minutes left.NOT SO KILLER POne of the most perplexing happenings in the league this season has been Penn’s play at home. The perennial Ivy contender has looked the part on the road, where it is 4-1, but at home, the Quakers are a surprising 0-4.Two weeks ago, Penn was swept at home by Cornell and Columbia, the first time it lost both weekend games at home in the league since 1968. And yet it happened again the next time up, with Harvard’s victory coming on the heels of Dartmouth’s 69-59 win the night before. A sign of the Quaker’s former dominance over those two northern schools is that in the 51 previous weekends those teams took a trip down to Philadelphia, Penn had never lost both games. That has changed now and Quakers look set for a second-straight mediocre Ivy season after winning the championship the previous three years.“I can’t get back tonight and I can’t get back last night,” Penn coach Glen Miller said. “It doesn’t do any good to dwell on it, you have to try and evaluate things and get better.”—Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

PRINCETON, N.J.—Another trip to Princeton, another similar result for the Harvard men’s basketball team as it fell, 58-55, in the final minutes for its 20th straight loss at Jadwin Gym on Friday night.The exciting ending came down to the last play. After Princeton guard Dan Mavraides knocked down two free throws with four seconds to put the Tigers (10-11, 5-3 Ivy) up 56-55, Crimson junior guard Jeremy Lin brought the ball up the court for Harvard (10-13, 2-7 Ivy). Lin passed halfcourt and dished the ball to senior guard Drew Housman on the left side of the court. Housman—the game’s leading scorer with 16 points—pulled up for the game-tying attempt several feet behind the arc, but his shot was too strong and bounced off the far side of the rim.“I told Drew it was a great shot,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I told him it was tremendous job by Jeremy making the decision, knowing we had enough time to get that pass in and we will take that any day of the week and twice on Sunday.”With the final shot failing, Princeton completed a season-sweep of Harvard, after winning 77-71 in Lavietes Pavilion earlier this month. But while that game was characterized by an effective Tigers offense and some porous Crimson defense, the visitors put in a much better performance on that end. While Princeton had just six turnovers in the first game and shot 56.8 percent from the floor, it coughed the ball up 15 times Friday and shot 46.2 percent on the game, including just 8-of-20 after halftime.The Tigers’ struggles kept Harvard close, but the Crimson came up just short in forcing one more Princeton turnover that may have changed the outcome of the game. With the visitors trailing, 52-51, after a layup by freshman forward Keith Wright with 1:10 to go, the Crimson seemed set to play more solid defense to get the ball back with a chance to take the lead. And with 37 ticks left, freshman Oliver McNally knocked the ball out of Princeton forward Kareem Maddox’s hands. But the ball bounced off McNally and out of bounds. The referees ruled that it was a change of possession, so the 35 second clock restarted, forcing Harvard to abandon its defensive game and foul.“We made a point of emphasis to get after them, get in the passing lanes,” Housman said. “We felt we should have gotten one more when Oliver fell out of bounds, that was a tough break.”Mavraides then hit two foul shots to put his team up by three. Freshman forward Peter Boehm answered by driving to the hoop for an open layup, only to see the shot miss. Mavraides made one of two on the other end, then Housman was fouled, making both shots to close within two at 55-53 with 12 seconds left. Mavraides went back to the line and again just made one of two, with McNally tacking down the defensive board and racing coast-to-coast for a layup with five seconds left to make it 56-55 and set up the endgame scenario.With Housman’s miss, an intense second half that featured four ties and seven lead changes was completed to the delight of the home fans. Harvard had a five-point lead early on at 31-26, but a six-minute drought on offense soon saw the Crimson down 41-36 with just over 10 minutes to play. But the team snapped out of it and would tie things up at 43-43 with seven minutes left on two free throws by McNally. It would grab the lead twice after. that, the last time when Housman beat his man and stepped in for a layup to put his team up 49-48 with 3:32 left.A minute later, Maddox would answer with two free throws, and the hosts would not give that up despite tenacious fight from Harvard.“We always have room to improve, that is obvious,” Amaker said. “I do think that the effort and energy we played with to give ourselves a chance tonight was tremendous.”The Crimson could have been severely undermanned near the end after both Wright and Lin left the game in the second half due to ankle injuries, but they each only missed a few minutes after some work on the bench and were back without missing much of a beat.“They’re both pretty tough guys,” Housman said. “They did whatever they had to do on the sideline, and they definitely battled down the stretch for us.”—Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—Jadwin Gym has never been a friend to the Harvard Crimson—at least not in the last 20 years.It was all the way back in 1989 when Harvard last took a game at Princeton. After Friday night’s 58-55 loss, nothing has changed.Even though the Tigers, as a program, have fallen far from its past position of dominance in the Ivies, the team still gives the Crimson trouble every time the squad comes to town.Especially under Tommy Amaker. The coach likes to play fast—quick tempo, quick shots, and pressing defense. Last year, Amaker did not have the personnel to run his system, but this year, he does.Wins at Boston College, New Hampshire, and Dartmouth prove it. But whenever the team comes to Jadwin, things start to slow down—considerably.“Obviously Princeton keeps things in low-scoring ways, so the numbers can be a little misleading in terms of the actual finishing numbers,” Amaker said. “But I thought we scraped and clawed defensively.”The defense was there, but when it mattered most, the offense was not. Harvard could not get into its attacking groove, and was forced to play the Princeton way.For 20 years, that hasn’t worked. But for the Crimson, there’s always next year. WHO’S HOUS’?The one thing that has worked for the Crimson at Jadwin Gym in recent history is not an offensive approach, but one standout scorer: senior guard Drew Housman. For four years, he has led the Crimson at the helm, trying to pull his team to that ever-elusive victory at Princeton.Two years ago, he came incredibly close, willing his team to two overtimes and the brink of victory, only to fall, 74-68, in a double-overtime thriller. He scored 18 of the team’s final 20 points in regulation and both overtimes, en route to a career-high 33 in the losing effort.Every time against the Tigers, he seems to find a hole and exploit it.“They were really worried about our shooters,” Housman said. “We were really limited in our three-pointers, and that means they were definitely spreading it out to our shooters. So that leaves lanes for people like me to drive, and [I’m] just being aggressive.”The history of Harvard playing at Princeton has been one of heartbreak, but Housman provides one bright spot.His 16-point, four-assist performance is just further proof. OVER AND OUTThings could have ended very differently for the Crimson had senior guard Evan Harris not fouled out with four minutes to play.Without his defensive presence, Harvard struggled to hold the Princeton big men in check, as Kareem Maddox, a tall forward shooting 83 percent from the line, got four easy ones off fouls from freshman Peter Boehm, who was forced to fill the void left by Harris.“Evan fouling out didn’t help us, we’re not deep and big, so not having Evan with his experience and his size is a big blow,” Amaker said. “It was unfortunate that he was in position to make the foul.”These four points were huge for Princeton, as Harvard tried to charge back and get a lead. Each time Harvard got closer, Maddox had two more free throws to put the Tigers back up by three.With Harris in, it might have been a different story.Without, the team was left scratching its head, thinking what to do next.—Staff writer Walter E.

The No. 4 Harvard women’s fencing team (17-1) cruised to its third Ivy League title yesterday with an overall undefeated record of 6-0 at the second part of the championship tournament held in Providence, R.I. After defeating Brown, 20-7, earlier in the day, the Crimson was guaranteed a share of the Ivy title. But the Crimson did not stop there, achieving its final victory against No. 6 Penn, 15-12, and clinching the top spot in the Ancient Eight. “We came off strong,” head coach Peter Brand said. “The Ivy League Championship was ours all along. It was a real team effort.” “[We are] really, really happy,” co-captain Emily Cross added. “Everyone fenced great and it’s really nice to finish things off with a bang.” Freshman Noam Mills led the team to its success with a 6-0 record on the day. Following Mills’ efforts were Cross and senior epee Lisa Vastola, who each went 5-1. Harvard had clinched the Ivy title in Mills’ final bout. Soon thereafter, cheers and excitement filled the room. “The women jumped up and down and hugged each other,” Brand said. “The last time the women won was in 2006. We’ve been building gradually. Having some really great freshman and bringing Emily Cross back from the Olympics certainly has given us the edge this year.” The Crimson showed a few signs of weakness throughout the day, especially in the sabre, where both Brown and Penn were able to edge out Harvard, 5-4, handing freshman Caroline Vloka two unusual losses. Vloka and teammate senior epee Maria Larsson finished the day 4-2. But it was the epee team that secured the Ivy title for the women, beating Penn 7-2 to make up for close losses in the foil and sabre. The epee team cumulated a mere three losses in 18 bouts, which was crucial in the team’s win against Penn. “The epee squad was fantastic,” Cross said. “They were really strong and it really helped us pull through.” The Crimson was able to win some key bouts in order to stay in the match. Harvard relied heavily on each team member doing her part to help the Crimson secure another Ivy League Championship. “We weren’t expected to do as well as we did,” Cross said. “Everyone really performed above and beyond expectations. What I love about this team is that everyone is really close…I think that helps us a lot when it comes to fencing in tournaments.” The No. 9 men’s team (9-9) responded to last week’s rough outing with a decisive win over Brown, 21-6, but was unable to notch the win against No. 4 Penn, losing 16-11.  “The men really redeemed themselves today,” Brand said. “They had a close match with Penn. I think [they] really were invigorated today beating Brown.” Four Crimson fencers went 5-1 on the day including co-captains Benji Ungar in epee and Kai Itamer-Kinter in the foil, freshman sabre Valentin Staller, and freshman epee James Hawrot. Although Harvard’s finish at the tournament was less than ideal, the Crimson showed promise for its future—especially from freshmen Staller and Hawrot.  Both Harvard teams will compete next Saturday at the IFA tournament held in Waltham, Mass. The women will use the tournament to stay fresh before they make a run for the national title this March. —Staff writer Melissa Schellberg can be reached at mlschell@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team began its season with a bang, claiming a 9-6 upset over No. 5 Duke yesterday afternoon.  The Crimson, who had not won against the Blue Devils since 2001, handed Duke its first loss of the season, dropping the Devils’ record to 2-1.Harvard dominated Duke in shooting during the contest, registering 45 shots on goal to the Devils’ 29. The Crimson had a 24-7 shot advantage in the first half alone.Harvard freshman Jeff Cohen also entered onto the collegiate lacrosse scene in fine form, filling in for pneumonia-plagued sophomore standout Dean Gibbons. Cohen tallied a hat trick in his first appearance in Harvard’s crimson and white, and helped his new team to its first victory of 2009.“[Cohen] played really well and he really stepped up in his first game,” said junior midfielder Jason Duboe. “It’s really exciting to watch him play.”Although the Crimson outshot and outscored its opponents, this offensive advantage was not always obvious.Duke began the game coming onto the field with engines firing, and recorded an early 11:56 goal in the first quarter.Harvard would have to wait for revenge against the Devil’s lone score—but when it responded it did so with a vengeance. The Crimson, led by its new freshman star, recorded three unanswered tallies in the second quarter.Cohen began the Crimson’s scoring spree at 11:09, finding the net with an assist from senior co-captain Max Motschwiller.  The freshman attackman wasted no time before notching another Harvard goal, scoring again at 10:41 from senior Nick Sapia.Junior Travis Burr finished the Crimson’s second quarter run, adding another tally from Sapia at 5:39.“We came out with some really good energy,” said senior co-captain Nick Smith. “It was great that we were able to hold Duke to one in the first half and that really frustrated them.”However, the matchup was not decided after the Crimson’s initial showing. Duke returned to the field and scored back-to-back goals in the third quarter, tying up the game 3-3.Harvard responded with a four-goal streak to end the third, securing the lead for the rest of the contest.  Duboe began the second half offensive with an unassisted goal at 4:41, followed by Cohen’s third, and final, tally of the day. Burr recorded his second score of the matchup at 1:54 from Motschwiller, who found the net himself with only nine seconds remaining in the quarter.The game concluded with three fourth-quarter Blue Devil goals and two Crimson tallies from junior Jesse Fehr and senior Jeff Wannop, to bring the final score up to 9-6 Harvard.“In general it was just a great team effort,” said Duboe. “We all controlled the game from start to finish and basically took care of the ball.”Senior co-captain Sam Slaughter echoed Duboe’s praises of his team.“We really controlled the tempo of the game,” said Slaughter. “We played with a lot of discipline and I think that made the difference today.”Although the Crimson was able to knock out their first top-10 team in head coach John Tillman’s time in Cambridge, Harvard will not be resting on its laurels. The Crimson has hard work ahead of it as the team attempts to surpass its 6-8, 1-5 conference record from 2008.“I definitely think this win is a great start, but we have a long road ahead of us and lots of improvements to make,” said Motschwiller. “We’re very excited about the win but we’re going to stay focused.”Despite the necessary hard work, Duboe is confident in his team’s ability to succeed in the upcoming season.“We’re going to gel on offense as the weeks go along and really find our roles, and our defense is going to shore up on everything,” said Duboe. “It’s definitely great to start out with a win—we’re just excited to keep the momentum going.”Harvard will look for another victory next Saturday as it travels to New York to take on Stony Brook.—Staff writer Alexandra J.

The Harvard skiing team recorded its fifth consecutive tenth-place finish this past weekend at the Middlebury College Winter Carnival in Middlebury, Vt. 
With 10-inches of fresh powder, the course conditions were ideal for the Crimson contingent, as the weather was sunny, with temperatures ranging in the mid-20s.
“The weather was phenomenal,” said men’s Nordic captain Dave McCahill. “It was perfect skiing conditions, and we were psyched to be there.” 
“It was absolutely gorgeous,” added women’s Nordic captain Anna Schulz. “It was the best day of skiing all year.”
Yet even with the great conditions, the Crimson was unable to improve on its string of 10-place finishes.
On the men’s side, junior alpine captain Chris Kinner notched two top-30 finishes over the weekend. 
After starting in the 43rd position, Kinner was able to claim 16th-place in the Giant Slalom event. In the Slalom event, Kinner placed 23rd, a 36-place improvement over his 59th starting position.
Three young skiers joined the captain in the alpine scoring columns. Freshman Kevin McNamara improved eight places from his 51st starting position to finish 43rd in the Giant Slalom event. Sophomore Brad Alvarez joined Kinner and McNamara in the Giant Slalom scoring, improving 22 places on his starting position of 72nd to place 50th overall in the race.  
In the Slalom event, McNamara narrowly missed a top-30 finish, placing 33rd after starting in the 61st position. Between Kinner, McNamara and sophomore Alec Boardman, who finished in 44th position after starting the race in 75th, the men’s Slalom squad scored 48 points, Harvard’s highest total of the weekend in an individual event.
In the men’s 10K MS event, McCahill finished 51st, followed closely by junior Trevor Petach in 53rd. 
With freshman Joe Tofte unable to compete due to illness, freshman Torin O’Brien stepped up to fill Tofte’s place and finished 58th.
The trio of McCahill, Petach, and O’Brien also brought home a 19th-place finish in the Men’s 3x5K Free Relay, earning the squad a second to last place finish in the twenty team field.
Despite the disappointing finish in the relay event, McCahill was proud of the performance of the men’s Nordic team, which is still unable to field a full roster of six skiers. 
“We had some good kick on the skis,” McCahill said. “It was great for [Torin] to be able to get experience in a top tier event.”
For the women’s team, freshman Caroline McHugh was the lone Crimson skier in the alpine events. She placed 32nd and 41st in the Giant Slalom and Slalom events, respectively, as she moved up over 10 spots in each race. 
Sophomore Cara Sprague, who has consistently been placing in the top-30 to score NCAA points, once again led the women’s Nordic team. 
Sprague finished 27th in the 10K MS event. 
Sophomore Alyssa Devlin and junior Audrey Mangan both fell barely short of top-30 finishes in the event, placing 34th and 37th, respectively.
Sprague, Devlin, and Mangan also comprised the 12th-placing Women’s 3x5K Free Relay squad. 
“It was the best relay finish in years,” Schulz said.
The team now turns its focus to next weekend, when it will compete in the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Championships in Sugarloaf, Maine. 
“We’re saving it for this weekend,” McCahill said. “We’re psyched.”
“Hopefully this will be our best weekend yet,” Schulz added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Between the hype, the stakes, and the caliber of the teams involved, Friday night’s game had all the right ingredients for another classic battle between the No. 9 Harvard women’s hockey team and No. 7 St. Lawrence.
But in the end, it was just another night, another conference win for the Crimson.
An early offensive outburst and a dominant defensive showing gave Harvard an easy 4-0 victory over the Saints at Bright Hockey Center in the first game of the final weekend of the regular season.
“Our kids had a lot of jump and they were certainly ready to go,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “They wanted to dictate play right from the beginning and they did.”
The rout was an unexpected one. Harvard entered the game one point behind St. Lawrence for first place in the ECAC standings, and the Saints had dealt the Crimson a 3-1 loss earlier in the season.
But Harvard came out of the locker room fired up, striking early and often, and before St. Lawrence could compose itself, the first period had ended and the Crimson held a 3-0 advantage.
“We’ve been coming out strong in a lot of our games,” sophomore forward Kate Buesser said. “It really sets the tone.”
Harvard tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt—riding a torrid streak in which she had factored into 19 of her team’s previous 23 goals—opened up the scoring for the Crimson with a goal 3:28 into the game.
Vaillancourt took a pass from junior Anna McDonald following a faceoff and drove down the left side of the ice. After eluding a pair of Saints defenders, Vaillancourt approached the net, holding onto the puck and patiently waiting for St. Lawrence goalie Brittony Chartier to make a move. Chartier took the bait, lunging and leaving her right side wide open. 
Vaillancourt slipped the puck into the vacant part of the net to give Harvard a 1-0 lead.
Just under seven minutes later, Vaillancourt lit the lamp again, this time flying solo.
After stealing the puck and racing into the Saints’ zone, the senior winger positioned herself in front of the net, with a defender and Chartier impeding the path to her 23rd goal of the season. With the direct route blocked, Vaillancourt took a detour, flicking a shot around the defender and over Chartier’s shoulder to deliver the puck to its final destination.
“[Vaillancourt] had a lot of energy,” Stone said. “She’ll find a way to get open, and I think people pushed the puck very well today so it allows for that to happen…She’s a dynamic player.”
With Harvard’s leading scorer setting the tone, Buesser followed suit.
Not to be outdone on this night, the sophomore contributed a pair of goals of her own.
With less than five minutes left in the first period, McDonald won the faceoff and got the puck to senior Sarah Wilson, who launched a shot that bounced off Chartier. Buesser put the rebound back in the net to make it a 3-0 game.
Midway through the second frame, Buesser’s number was called again.
Receiving the puck from sophomore defenseman Ashley Wheeler, McDonald took the puck to the right circle and found an open Buesser at the far post. 
Buesser sent home another one to score the Crimson’s final goal of the night. McDonald’s assist was her third on the game and Wheeler picked up her first career point.
“I think today’s game was the definition of team,” Buesser said. “Everyone was on their game.”
But while Harvard’s aggressive offensive assault was the story of the game, its defense provided a compelling subplot.
St. Lawrence mustered 22 shots on the night—just one shy of the Crimson’s 23—but Harvard controlled the tempo of the game from start to finish.
Even during the copious amount of time the Crimson spent a man down—the team logged 23 penalty minutes—Harvard seemed to always be on the offensive.
And when the Saints finally seemed on the verge of creating a legitimate scoring opportunity, junior Christina Kessler—the Crimson’s stalwart goaltender—was there to rebuff any St. Lawrence advances, notching her fourth shutout of the season.
“It starts with the defensive end,” Buesser said. “We feel like our team has enough offensive talent that the offense will come. We just focus on defense.”
With Harvard’s priorities in place, the team cruised through the rest of the game to take a 4-0 win and first place in the ECAC.

Whenever the puck got away, they got to it first. Whenever a rebound appeared, they made sure they had it back on their stick. When fighting the Clarkson Golden Knights Saturday at Bright Hockey Center, the Harvard women’s hockey team showed that it wanted it more.The No. 9 Crimson (17-9-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) claimed its second straight ECAC regular-season title on Senior Day, defeating the Golden Knights (16-12-6, 10-8-4), 6-1, in an action-packed game that had both an onslaught of shots and penalties.“Our kids came out with a sense of urgency,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I think we are playing very team-oriented hockey right now, and that’s what we want to continue to do.”The Crimson started out the game on the attack, scoring its first goal just three minutes into the game. Setting up the offense, senior Nora Sluzas took a slapshot from the blue line. Tri-captain Jenny Brine took control of the puck and tipped in a shot right between Clarkson goaltender Lauren Dahm’s legs, putting the Crimson up, 1-0, before most spectators had even reached their seats.Three minutes later, the Golden Knights responded after Brine was whistled for hooking. Clarkson got on the board when junior Britney Selina took a pass from Melissa Waldie and snuck the puck past Harvard junior goalie Christina Kessler with nine seconds left on the power play.“There was no letdown,” Stone said. “It was just all right, here we are. They’re not going to back down, they’re going to keep coming at us. And everybody knew that, so it was just a matter of responding.”The team’s opening came on the power play, when senior Kati Vaughn fed tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt a pass in the Harvard end. Vaillancourt drove up the ice, slipped between two Clarkson defenders, and deposited the puck in the low left corner.In the last two minutes of the first period, sophomore Liza Ryabkina would add a goal of her own. Katharine Chute found her classmate charging in from the right side, and Ryabkina chipped the puck into the right corner of the net, putting the Crimson up, 3-1.On the defensive side, Kessler made nine saves in the first period. The junior left the game after the first frame, replaced by senior Brittany Martin.“[Kessler] got banged up, and we just wanted to be safe,” Stone said. “[Martin] was ready to go, and she did a great job.”Harvard came out in the second, still riding its wave of momentum. At 4:26, on another power-play opportunity, junior Cori Bassett sent a pass to Vaillancourt, who launched a slapshot at Knights goalie Eve Grandmont-Berube. Grandmont-Berube, who took over for Dahm after Ryabkina’s goal, deflected the shot and watched as the puck landed on the edge of Brine’s stick. Brine tipped it in for the 4-1 lead.Both teams would continue to find themselves in power-play situations throughout the game. The Crimson had six players hit the penalty box, while Clarkson was whistled nine times.The next goal, however, would not come during a power play but instead during both teams’ line shifts. Senior Sarah Wilson, taking control of the puck, sent a long pass to fresh-off-the-bench sophomore Kate Buesser, who wristed it into the net to put the Crimson up, 5-1, with 12 minutes left in the period.“It’s great to see our team just dominating out there, just playing our game and not letting them have anything,” Buesser said.The third period saw less action, as the Golden Knights’ defense held strong against the Harvard attack. Vaillancourt scored her second goal with less than four minutes left in the game. The tri-captain skated in alone on a breakaway and went top-shelf to seal the regular-season title.Dahm and Grandmont-Berube combined for 31 saves, while Kessler and Martin finished with a total of 23. The Crimson was 2-for-8 on the power play and held Clarkson to just one goal in six opportunities.With the regular-season crown taken care of, Harvard’s focus is now squarely on the postseason.“Today’s the end of the regular season, Monday’s a brand-new season for us, and it’s time to take one game at a time there too,” Stone said. “We put ourselves in a good position. We’ve been able to get back to where we can maybe do some damage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After pulling off a dramatic 22-point comeback Friday night in order to ensure victory, the Harvard women’s basketball team knew that it could not afford to fall into the same hole against Penn on Saturday night. The Crimson (15-8, 7-2 Ivy) came out strong and finished even stronger on both ends of the court against the Quakers (6-17, 3-6 Ivy), taking the motivation from its last game and jumping out to what was as high as a 21-point lead  in the second half. When the final buzzer sounded, Harvard came out with a much more comfortable 69-54 win.Once again, the offensive production of the Crimson’s starting five took center stage, as they scored 63 of the team’s 69 points. For the seventh time this season, sophomore Emma Markley, the team’s leading scorer, had a double-double, posting a team-high 23 points and 14 rebounds, finishing strong inside on offense and dominating the boards.Freshman Brogan Berry and fellow guard senior Emily Tay had tremendous nights of their own as well, making sure that the momentum of the game stayed with Harvard, while putting the pressure on a Penn team that could not seem to keep up. Berry was the only Crimson player to make a three-pointer, sinking 3-of-4 from downtown. She was well aware of her range, utilizing the step-in jump shot very often. She finished with 19 points, one assist, and three steals. Tay’s crossovers, spin moves, and reverse layups pumped up the crowd, while her awareness of each player’s position on the court was impressive. She finished with a 9-1 assist-to-turnover ratio and 14 points of her own.“Our guards can beat their guards and could have gone up against them all night,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Our guards have been our scorers, especially when they were triple-teaming Emma Markley in the first half. I thought we had the advantage there.”Berry also notes how the Quakers’ focus on Markley helped her and Tay get into a rhythm. “Our bigs had a great night tonight, so they were bringing the defense in, and they just opened things up for us at the perimeter,” Berry said. “It was all a team effort, and it just came with the flow of the game.”But perhaps the most important story of the night was Harvard’s play on the defensive end of the floor. It was its mediocre defensive first half against Princeton that had caused the team to fall so far behind on Friday night. Saturday, the Crimson was looking to start with the same intensity with which it had finished the night before. Harvard smothered the interior and the paint, and Penn was unable to drive to the basket. Still, the Quakers were able to stay in the game with their outside shooting.“We were struggling to get the shooters out of their range or out of their groove,” Markley said.After the Crimson took a 47-29 lead midway through the second half, Penn attempted to mount a comeback, going on an 11-0 run. The Quakers’ Carrie Biemer made a layup and then sank three consecutive jumpers from beyond the arc, cutting the Crimson’s lead down to 7. “Biemer is a really impact scorer,” Delaney-Smith said, “As soon as she gets daylight, she scores.”This would be the closest that Penn would be able to get in the second half, as Harvard ended the game on a 10-4 run. That the Crimson was able to put in this type of performance without its injured co-captain Niki Finelli made the night all the more impressive.“I thought it was a tremendous team effort,” Delaney-Smith said. “Sometimes when you lose a player the caliber of Niki Finelli, who’s one of the consistent double-figure scorers for us, it sets you back on your heels. So I was pretty proud that we played for her instead of worrying about her. I thought the young kids stepped up big tonight.”With only five games left to play in the season, the Crimson understands that defense will be key if it is to win the Ivy League title.“Great defense by everyone gives you that spark on the offense,” Markley saidThe team hopes that this great defensive and offensive spark transfers to Friday’s game in New York, where they seek to repay Columbia for the loss at Lavietes. Harvard takes on the Lions at 7 p.m. on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you weren’t one of the 614 fans in attendance at the Harvard women’s basketball (15-8, 7-2 Ivy) game against Princeton (9-14, 4-5 Ivy) last Friday, then you missed arguably the most exciting game the Lavietes Pavilion has seen all school year.  The giant “H” that lies prominently at half court almost seemed to stand for “Houdini” rather than “Harvard” in the second half of the game.  
After an abysmal first half that left the Crimson down, 34-15, Harvard shocked all onlookers both on and off of the court by outscoring Princeton 39-16 in the second half and finishing with a 54-50 win.  A seemingly dead Crimson team revived itself at halftime and orchestrated run after unanswered run in the final minutes of the game, each time sinking its teeth deeper into Princeton’s seemingly untouchable lead.  
With less than a minute to go, the game was tied, 50-50.  As the atmosphere was overflowing with energy and the crowd tensed, sophomore Emma Markley sealed the deal as Harvard earned an astonishing win.  
After Markley hit a huge layup in traffic with 36 seconds to go, giving Harvard a 52-50 advantage, the Tigers had one more chance to stay in the game.  Princeton senior guard Jessica Berry missed a critical jumper and Markley was fouled as she inhaled the rebound.  She delivered the dagger from the line, hitting both free throws and sealing the game.  
What made the game so exciting was not merely the statistics of the final outcome, but the fact that Harvard was able to rally its players after playing so poorly in the first half.  The team was out of sync, the crowd was disheartened, and Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith was infuriated.  
“They could not have gotten worse,” said Delaney-Smith of her team’s performance in the first half.  “They weren’t us. It may have been the worst half of basketball in my 27 years.  Princeton was laughing at us.”
“We didn’t come out with enough intensity or energy,” said Markley, who finished with 16 points and eight rebounds.  “I don’t think we wanted it, or we didn’t seem like we wanted it.”  
Harvard had just two points in the first eight minutes of the game and did not get into double-digits until four minutes remained in the half.  With 10 first-half turnovers, the Crimson simply did not take care of the ball.  
Meanwhile, the Tigers were taking their time, looking for cutters, and creating open shots for their top scorers.  Princeton’s sharpshooting Berry played target practice from various points behind the arc, hitting four of five three-pointers in the first half.  Each of her rainbow set shots appeared to pause momentarily at its peak; she backpedaled triumphantly just as each ball plunged perfectly through the goal, touching nothing but the bottom of the net.
“Princeton was really hot,” said co-captain Emily Tay, who initiated the second half comeback with a steady stream of points and dishes.  “They were confident.  They caught us off guard and we were back on our heels.”
No one would quite reveal what was said in the Crimson locker room at halftime, but Harvard came out looking revitalized.
“You wouldn’t want to be a fly on the wall in there,” Delaney-Smith said. 
“She had a few choice words,” Markley said.  “I’m sure that got us fired up.”
As soon as the second half began, the Crimson’s body language changed, and it began quietly scraping at Princeton’s 19-point lead.  After a fade-away 12-footer from Tay, a strong layup in the paint from Markley, and a three from freshman guard Brogan Berry, the Harvard side of the bleachers started catching on to its team’s second wind. Minutes later, Princeton’s lead was cut to 10 by an acrobatic layup from Tay and an ensuing trip to the line for forward Katie Rollins, who was injured last week.  At this point the crowd was on its feet.
The crowd was right—out of nowhere, the comeback was in full force.  Crimson sophomore guard Jackie Alemany caught a fancy dish from Tay and sunk a three, cutting the lead to seven.  
Senior forward Emma Moretzsohn banked in a hook shot.  Then Tay hit one of two from the line.  Moretzsohn again.  The lead was now cut to two with eight minutes left.
“We basically turned on the switch,” Tay said.  
Another clutch trey from Berry gave Harvard a 40-39 lead, its first of the game, with five minutes to go.  Markley scored the next six points for the Crimson in just 90 seconds.  
Princeton stuck around, regaining the lead as freshman Lauren Edwards connected from downtown with 1:43 left in the game.   
Less than a minute later, Markley’s heroics put Harvard back on top for good. 
“I think tonight was a huge team effort,” Markley said.  “Everyone contributed.”
Friday night’s thrilling win kept the Crimson’s season alive, as a loss would have taken the team out of second place in the Ivy standings and further distanced them from undefeated Dartmouth (13-9, 8-0 Ivy). 
“It was good heart,” said Tay.  “We like to keep it exciting, though.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard’s seniors, Saturday’s game against Clarkson was more than just a chance to play for the ECAC title.It was also the last regular-season home game for the seven Crimson seniors—Sarah Wilson, Kati Vaughn, Nora Sluzas, Brittany Martin, and tri-captains Jenny Brine, Sarah Vaillancourt, and Kirsten Kester.And although Harvard has earned the right to play at Bright for the duration of the ECAC playoffs, the Crimson’s class of 2009 was honored after the game for its contributions to the program.“It’s so huge for us,” Vaughn said. “We’ve had a tough season, it hasn’t been easy for us, but for us to finish like this is really exciting.”Before the post-game ceremony, though, Harvard’s oldest skaters showed just how much the team will miss them next year.Every senior skater except for Kester finished the afternoon with at least one point—with Vaillancourt, Brine and Vaughn each recording three.Martin, who has backed up junior goaltender Christina Kessler for the last two seasons, played the last 40 minutes of Saturday afternoon’s game, holding the Golden Knights scoreless and making 14 saves.“I’ve had just the greatest two years with them, and they deserve every win that they get,” sophomore Kate Buesser said.  “It’s a great way to send them off into our new season, and hopefully we can keep it going for them.”SECOND STRINGERSIt’s been nearly a month since Buesser, Wilson, and junior Anna McDonald became the Crimson’s second line, and for weeks, the trio has struggled to put the puck in the net.In the line’s first nine games playing together, it mustered just eight points—three of which came last Saturday against Colgate, when Buesser and McDonald assisted on Wilson’s third-period game-winner.In comparison, Vaillancourt alone recorded 22 points in that same stretch.It wasn’t that the trio wasn’t creating opportunities. It was simply a matter of finishing them.That all changed Friday night, when the second line combined for six points to send Harvard past St. Lawrence and into first place in the ECAC for good.“It is great to see results,” Buesser said. “We have a grade-A chance thing that we record, and I feel like our line has a lot of those, but it’s great to finally get some in the net.”Wilson and Buesser connected for another score on Saturday afternoon.The most impressive example of the line’s chemistry came near the end of the first period Friday.McDonald won a faceoff in the offensive zone and quickly passed the puck to Wilson. The senior launched a shot at Saints netminder Brittony Chartier, and though the puck bounced off the goalie’s pads, Buesser was waiting at the right post to slam it home.Just like that, Harvard and its second line were flying with a 3-0 lead.“They’ve had a lot of weeks of really great play,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “They’re playing with a lot of confidence, and finally the results are showing. And that’s the most important thing—that they didn’t get discouraged, they just kept after it.”WE ARE THE CHAMPIONSThough Harvard took a different road through its conference slate this season, the end destination was the same. With its 6-1 thrashing of Clarkson on Saturday, the Crimson claimed its second consecutive and sixth overall ECAC regular-season title.Harvard finished one point ahead of St. Lawrence for the league crown, while Princeton slipped by a fading Dartmouth squad on Saturday to grab third place.Not bad for a Crimson team that was under .500 just seven weeks ago.“It means a lot, because I’m sure there were a lot of people who counted us out,” Stone said. “Our kids just kept working and stayed determined and played one game at a time. And see what happened…we’ve been able to crawl ourselves back and now we’re in a good position.”Harvard was the preseason favorite to win the conference after going a perfect 26-0-0 in ECAC games last season.In another callback to last season, the top-seeded Crimson will once again face off against eighth-seeded Cornell in the tournament’s opening round. Last year, Harvard swept the Big Red, 3-2 and 4-2, at Bright en route to the tournament championship.—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike junior co-captains No. 10 Louis Caputo and No. 4 J.P. O’Connor, the Harvard wrestling team did not go undefeated this past weekend. Harvard (5-12, 2-3 Ivy) hosted Columbia, No. 22 Hofstra, and No. 2 Cornell at the Malkin Athletic Center Friday and Saturday for senior weekend. The Crimson tackled Columbia (3-14, 1-4 Ivy League) first, overcoming the Lions, 25-18. Up next, the No. 22 Pride (10-6) proved to be more of a challenge, defeating Harvard, 31-11. Last on the line-up was wrestling powerhouse No. 2 Big Red, who topped the Crimson, 34-9.Despite his team’s solid effort in the Friday split, Harvard coach Jay Weiss expressed disappointment with the lopsided defeat against Cornell.“Our job is to go out on the mat and fight,” Weiss said. “But we didn’t wrestle hard [against the Big Red].”Harvard showed little energy as it limped through the end of the dual meet season, and must regroup and overcome lingering injuries in time for the ECAC championships in two weeks.NO. 2 CORNELL 34, HARVARD 9Cornell lived up to its reputation on Saturday with a victory in eight out of 10 matches against the Crimson. O’Connor and Caputo were the only two grapplers for Harvard to notch a win against the Big Red. Both emerged from the weekend unscathed. Caputo capped an undefeated effort with a forfeit by Cornell, while O’Connor overpowered Derek Schreiner by decision 6-1. O’Connor cruised through his matches, despite battling illness.“J.P. has been sick all week,” Weiss said. “He hasn’t been to practice and he gutted it out.”Sophomore Corey Jantzen, too, is not 100 percent, and even though he wrestled Friday, his hurt ankle kept him sidelined against Cornell.“It is that same lingering high ankle sprain,” O’Connor said. “But, he will be ready to go soon. All Corey needs is to have a good tournament and he’s going to win a national title.”Another standout, rookie Walter Peppelman, came up short in a hard fought match against DJ Meagher. Even though the Crimson wrestler clearly had the advantage in both the second and third periods, he suffered a 3-1 loss due to an early takedown by his opponent.“Those are the toughest matches to lose,” O’Connor said. “When you kind of come on at the end of the match and you find out in the last minute that you are better than the guy and [still] end up losing.”Ultimately, the Big Red reigned over the Crimson, dominating the match with a 25-point margin of victory.NO. 22 HOFSTRA 31, HARVARD 11The Crimson struggled early on against the Pride, forfeiting at 125 and falling at both 133 and 141. However, Peppelman rebounded to continue his streak, overwhelming his opponent 17-0, and earning yet another technical fall.“For me it’s always fun to go out and wrestle after him,” O’Connor said. “He definitely pumps up the crowd and I think he deserves a lot of respect...He goes out there and kills guys 17-nothing, 18-nothing.”O’Connor and Caputo also did not disappoint, capitalizing on Peppleman’s momentum to defeat their opponents by decision. Unfortunately for Harvard, its momentum was short-lived and the squad ultimately fell to Hofstra.HARVARD 25, COLUMBIA 18Harvard came out strong early in its first match of the weekend against Columbia. After awarding the Lions the first points of the match due to a forfeit at 125, senior Tommy Picarsic (133) paced the team with a 9-2 decision, setting the tone for the rest of the match.  Following Picarsic’s example, Jantzen (141), Peppelman (149), and O’Connor (157) all triumphed over their opponents in succession. With the reemergence of Jantzen from an ankle injury as well as Peppleman’s continued win streak and team-leading eighth technical fall, the weekend looked promising for the Crimson.  After a tough loss at 165 to freshman Bryan Panzano, sophomore Andy Olsen (174) and Caputo (184) regained momentum and clinched the victory with a fall and technical fall, respectively.  Senior Patrick Ziemnik also stood out this weekend at 197, wrestling up two weight classes. Due to the absence of both heavyweights for medical reasons, Ziemnik stepped up to help the team.“To me [Ziemnik’s effort] really stands out,” Weiss said.Ziemnik held his own, only falling by decision, 11-4.

The Crimson men’s tennis team traveled to the mid-west this weekend for a pair of testing match-ups against two top Big Ten teams. On Friday evening, No. 48 Harvard (4-3), traveled to chilly Ann Arbor to take on No. 19 Michigan (6-4), where the Crimson failed to overcome the Wolverines for the fourth consecutive year. The team then drove 200 miles through a snowstorm to play Northwestern (10-1) in Evanston, Illinois, where Harvard could not earn a point against the Wildcats.“The weekend was really challenging,” Crimson coach Dave Fish said. “It was very humbling for the team.” NORTHWESTERN 7, HARVARD 0 Harvard entered Sunday’s match at Combe Tennis Center looking to turn the tables on 4-3 defeats against the Wildcats in 2006 and 2007. But the ailing Crimson left disappointed after being shut out 7-0.“We had almost half the guys sick or injured,” co-captain Chris Clayton said. “We were a beat up team. We didn’t have the guts today.”Sunday marked the seventh Northwestern shutout of the season. The only victory of the afternoon came from the No. 1 doubles pair of Clayton, ranked No. 53 nationally, and sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans, who won 8-3. The team lost the doubles point after neither of the other pairs could knock off the Wildcats. In singles play, Harvard lost in straight sets on all six courts.“I haven’t seen us lose that many matches in straight sets that quickly in a long time,” Clayton said. He added that it reminded him of the team’s last 7-0 loss in 2006 at Illinois. NO. 19 MICHIGAN 5, HARVARD 2 Fortune was not on the Crimson’s side on Friday evening. Harvard had to fight not only a top-20 team in Michigan, but also by injury and sickness. With senior Sasha Ermakov stricken with flu, freshman Alistair Felton suffered a pulled hip muscle halfway through his doubles match, preventing him from competing in singles.“We used up our luck in winning the ECAC tournament [last weekend],” Fish said.The Wolverines took the doubles point to start the evening. At No. 1, Clayton and Chijoff-Evans lost to Michigan’s top duo 8-6, before the No. 2 partnership of junior Michael Hayes and Felton squeezed out a win 9-8 (8-6). Despite his pulled muscle, Felton was able to finish his doubles match. Freshman Davis Mangham and sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien fell 8-3 at No. 3.In singles, Clayton performed strongly at No. 1 in the second set after dropping the first. Playing for the first time this year, the co-captain maintained focus in the deciding super tiebreak to win 4-6, 6-4, 10-8.“Clayton is coming off walking pneumonia and hasn’t played since November,” Fish said. “His performance was pretty remarkable.”“My expectations were pretty low coming into the match,” Clayton added. “I didn’t know where my fitness level would be. I came in with the attitude of trying as hard as I could.”No. 2 Chijoff-Evans faced a similar situation to Clayton’s. Also losing the first set, Chijoff-Evans won the second set and super tiebreak to take the match 5-7, 6-3, 10-6.The remainder of Harvard’s singles matches did not go quite as well as the top two courts.At No. 3, Hayes had difficulty keeping up with the Wolverines’ co-captain Peter Aarts, dropping his two sets, 6-1 and 6-2, while No. 4 Mangham lost to his opponent, 7-5 and 6-2. Omodele-Lucien made his first appearance on the No. 5 court due to Felton’s pulled muscle, but lost, 6-4, 6-7 (9), and 10-4.“[The second set] boosted my confidence for the ten-point [tie]breaker, but I got ahead of myself and was not as focused as I needed to be,” said Omodele-Lucien. “It was a tough match, but you learn from a loss like that because you know what to do next time when you’re in that kind of situation. I’m stronger because of this loss.”At No. 6, freshman Robertson McAnulty had the opportunity to play in his first dual match of his collegiate career due to Felton’s injury. But the walk-on faded as the match progressed, losing 6-3, 6-0.“It was a learning experience. I learned what it’s like to play in that atmosphere and [realized] ways that I can improve,” McAnulty said.The team will have next weekend off before taking on Marquette at the Murr Center on March 8.

The Harvard women’s tennis team had a successful weekend, splitting with non-conference opponents No. 33 Illinois (6-2) and Binghamton (4-2). After a hard-fought, 5-2 loss to the Fighting Illini, the Crimson rebounded with a solid performance against the Bearcats on Sunday, winning 5-2.  NO. 33 ILLINOIS 5 HARVARD 2Harvard met its first major test of the season when it hosted Illinois on Saturday. Although the Crimson played competitively in the doubles matches, the Illini’s experience and depth helped them defeat Harvard.“I’m really proud of our squad today,” Green said. “We definitely had a lot of energy today, and I’m proud of the way we fought. I see a big improvement from last weekend.” Senior Beier Ko dropped the first two games of her opening set, but quickly rebounded to 3-3 and proceeded to win at No. 1, 6-4, 6-4, improving her record to 4-0 in the dual season.  “I got off to a slow start, but we were very motivated to play Illinois as a whole,” Ko said. “I was really determined to win that match.” Ko also played spectacularly with sophomore Agnes Sibilski in doubles at No. 2. Down 7-5 to Marisa Lambropobus and Megan Fudge, Ko and Sibilski fought back to tie it at 7-7. After dropping the first point of the tiebreaker, the pair quickly garnered a 4-1 lead. The teams exchanged two points each, and Illinois then answered with its own four-point streak to lead 7-6. Ko and Sibilski won five of the next seven points to win the tiebreaker and the match, 8-7 (11-9).  Jania won her match against Lambropobus to improve her record to 3-1 in the dual season, making her the only freshman since 2005-2006 to start 3-1 in the spring season.  After going down 3-2 in the first set, Jania continued to apply pressure and rebounded to win the set, 7-5. She used that momentum in the second set, comfortably winning 6-1 to capture the second point for the Crimson. “Playing a top-ranked team definitely helps us improve,” Green said. “It totally gets us ready for the Ivy season, and we’re not going to take anyone lightly.” HARVARD 5, BINGHAMTON 2After a tough loss to Illinois, the Harvard women’s tennis team rebounded impressively with a win over Binghamton. The Crimson (2-3) showed the depth of its rotation and played with energy against the Bearcats to win the match. “I think overall it was nice to see our squad bounce back from yesterday’s loss to a tough team,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “Binghamton is definitely a dangerous team.”The Crimson opened strong, sweeping the doubles matches to start the contest with a 1-0 lead. At No. 1, captain Laura Peterzan and sophomore Samantha Rosekrans defeated Jillian Santos and Yulia Smirnova, 8-6, gaining their first win of the season as a pair. Peterzan competed at No. 1 singles and comfortably closed out Binghamton’s Lauren Bates, 6-1, 6-0. Freshman Camille Jania dominated the first set at No. 2, beating Santos 6-1. Santos rebounded with a 6-0 victory in the second set, and led 5-2 in the third set. After winning three straight games to tie 5-5, Jania eventually forced a tiebreaker, but Santos won it 8-4, dropping Jania’s record to 3-2 in this spring. Freshman Louise Laciny clinched the victory for the Crimson after a nail-biting first set, triumphing over Basak Gone, 7-5, 6-3. Classmate Caroline Davis notched her first career win in duals play by defeating opponent Danyelle Shapiro, 6-3, 6-1.“I think we showed our depth today,” Green said.“I’m proud of our freshman and how they stepped up in doubles and singles. “It gives them confidence, and we showed we’re ready to put anybody in if we need to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harvard women’s basketball team’s victorisou weekend that included wins against Penn and Princeton, it was forced to switch from the style of play it had employed all season. The squad, praised for the performance of its guards—Emily Tay, Brogan Berry and Niki Finelli—looked to shift some of the scoring duties over to the team’s forwards. “Our guards have been our scorers when it should be our forwards,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We are trying to do a better job. They started double and triple teaming Emma Markley, but she still manages. We want that balance back.”Friday’s 22-point Crimson comeback saw a collapse in the team’s perimeter shooting, which allowed Princeton to take the lead against the best shooting team in the Ivy League. Harvard was held to 14.8 percent from the field and shot 16.7 percent from three-point territory.  When the Crimson came out of the locker room for the second half, it looked to its forwards to close the gap. The transition from a perimeter-oriented offense to a big-man offense allowed sophomore Emma Markley to shine.This transition continued in Saturday’s matchup as Markley led the team with easy buckets underneath.  Her formidable presence on the boards allowed the resurgence of Harvard guard play. After Markley was double-teamed, the Crimson guards picked up where she left off. Harvard went 20 percent from beyond the arc in the first half, only landing one three pointer, but shot 50 percent from the three-point line in the second half after the guards took over the scoring initiative. THREE-POINT LANDThe Crimson, a team that is usually wet from beyond arc, saw a breakdown in its three-point shooting this weekend. The team shot 27.3 percent from three-point range on Friday and 33.3 percent on Saturday.  “They are hesitating,” Delaney-Smith said. “Tay is an excellent shooter, but she doesn’t like to shoot. I’m trying to get all of them to shoot more.”The role that Penn and Princeton’s defensive efforts played in the lapse was arguable.“They came in knowing our system, but every team knows each other team’s system well because it’s a small league,” Delaney-Smith said.In Saturday’s game against the Quakers, Berry was the only player to make a three and her shooting accounted for all three team three pointers. The Crimson only attempted nine three-point shots against Penn, as it looked to get its forwards more involved in scoring. Friday’s matchup saw Harvard capitalize on three of its eleven three-point attempts, a disappointing statistic for a sharp-shooting team. “That was the worst half of basketball I’ve seen in my career,” Delaney-Smith said. “I didn’t know what they were doing out there. I felt embarrassed, but it wasn’t me—it was them.”The Crimson then relied on the foot work of Markley underneath to pick up the slack of the team’s three-point shooting in the game against Penn.ON THE BOARDSDespite the 22-point deficit on Friday, the Crimson was able to take control of the boards. The Crimson snagged over 42 rebounds compared to Princeton’s 27. Harvard was especially dominant on the offensive glass, posting 16 offensive rebounds to Princeton’s five. Despite stellar rebounding, the Crimson was unable to capitalize in the first half. When play shifted to Markley in the second half she made her presence felt on the boards, tallying 8 rebounds.“We struggled to get into a groove,” Marley said. “They pressured me on the inside, it was tough but we need to play harder on the boards.”Harvard also out-rebounded Penn, 40-28, but was able to convert on their rebounding efforts.By the end of the weekend, Harvard found a system that worked after a catastrophic start in the form of a 22-point first half deficit. The Crimson showed its resilience, as it moves to close out the regular season.—Staff writer Evan Kendall can be reached at ekendall@fas.harvard.edu.

The Crimson couldn’t dominate either T this weekend—Trinity or the center of the court.The fifth-ranked Harvard men’s squash team’s aspirations to bring home the CSA National Team Championship were crushed by unassailable No. 1 Trinity on Saturday. After upsetting No. 4 Cornell the day before, the Crimson (7-6, 3-3 Ivy league matches) was absolutely no match for the Bantams. Harvard then wrapped up its trip to Princeton, N.J. with a loss against No. 6 Rochester yesterday afternoon in a consolation match that left Harvard just shy of third place, but not disappointed.“I feel like we had a great weekend,” captain Verdi DeSesa said. “We beat our ranking coming in, which is what we were looking to do.”NO. 6 ROCHESTER 7, HARVARD 2Rochester (12-6) was vengeful coming into the match, with a 5-4 December loss against the Crimson still vivid in their minds. The Yellowjackets got the last laugh, though, triumphing over Harvard to claim third place.Junior Colin West finished a strong weekend with a 9-1, 9-4, 9-0 drubbing of Rochester’s Jim Bristow, and sophomore Richard Hill earned an additional win for the Crimson, but the rest of the lineup faltered against the Yellowjackets.Senior Ned Reeves overcame a two-game deficit against Yohay Wakabayashi to even the match with a particularly strong 9-1 fourth set, but could not sustain the momentum, falling 9-6 in the fifth.Junior Franklin Cohen also went the distance, giving Joseph Chapman all he could handle, but could not top the Yellowjacket in five sets.With the remaining contests finishing 3-0, Harvard could not muster a comeback, settling for fourth place.No. 1 TRINITY 9, HARVARD 0The Crimson knew it had to give it its all to beat the Bantams, but Trinity (19-0) proved why they have been national champions for a decade. The Bantams had not tasted defeat in 200 squash matches going into the match against Harvard—the longest win streak for any collegiate sport—and easily captured win 201.“Trinity is an unstoppable force right now,” said DiSesa of the eventual national champions. “We know they have a lot of great players, but a lot of us have the ability to play with them, so this is the matchup we wanted.”Trinity swept the Crimson in what seemed like lopsided play. The Bantams asserted their supremacy with 3-0 victories in seven of nine matches.The day started off with Harvard senior Niko Hrdy challenging Trinity’s Manek Mathur in a close contest, 9-7. Things turned bad, though, as Mathur kept Hrdy scoreless in the next two games to give Trinity its first win.Hill was only one of two Crimson competitors to win a game against Trinity, taking the third set from Supreet Singh. Singh had won the first game easily, 9-1, and struggled to keep Hill off in the second, 9-7, before dropping one to him, 9-1. But Singh bounced back and sealed the match with a 9-3 fourth set.Reeves traded games with Chris Binnie before the Bantam’s ninth seed put the game away (9-3, 3-9, 9-3, 9-5). The Crimson did not fare any better after Reeves’ loss, failing to provide much competition for Trinity.Eliot Buchanan challenged the Bantam’s Parth Sharma in the second set in a heated 10-8 contest, but the Crimson sophomore couldn’t overtake Sharma and fell 3-0. The rest of the team lost in the same manner, including the Crimson’s No. 1 player, West, who was the only Harvard competitor to beat the Bantams earlier this month. Trinity’s Baset Chaudhry fended off West in the first game, 9-6, before he cruised to easy victories in the next two games, 9-2 and 9-4.HARVARD 5, CORNELL 4The Crimson came into the match seeking to avail their first loss of the season when they dropped a road contest against the Big Red in December, 6-3. It appeared that Harvard was taking care of business with an impressive start to the tournament. The Crimson swept the first three matches, led by dominant performances by Hrdy, Hill, and Reeves. All three defeated their opponents 3-0 in their contests.But Cornell wasn’t ready to give up, and the Big Red’s Thomas Spettigue won against sophomore J. Reed Endresen, 3-1. Buchanan responded for the Crimson with another commanding 3-0 win, though the first two games were highly contested, until Buchanan overcame Cornell’s David Hilton 9-2 in the third set.The next three matches mirrored the beginning, with the Big Red taking three straight. Harvard freshman William Ahmed, DiSesa, and junior Franklin Cohen all dropped their contests 3-0, setting up a tense encounter in the No. 1 slot between the Crimson’s West and Will Hartigan.West displayed his finesse by beating Hartigan in three games, capping a brilliant performance with a shutout (9-4, 9-4, 9-0).“Cornell was a big match for us,” Cohen said. “We had to beat them [to move on] and it was very exciting, especially given the lineup they brought.”Cohen hinted that the Big Red rearranged their order to better its odds, bu t Cornell could not overcome a determined Crimson squad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a teaspoon of heart, a splash of soul and a cup of aggression, the Harvard women’s water polo team began to find the right mixture this weekend at the Princeton Invitational in New Jersey, although at times the recipe fell short. Similar to play at last week’s Harvard Invitational, the Crimson (3-3) again split its games. The women’s squad dominated both of its day matches against Villanova on Saturday and George Washington yesterday. When the sun set, however, Harvard fell, 10-8, to Ivy rival Princeton Saturday night and lost, 14-13, to Bucknell yesterday in the last of the weekend’s battles.“Overall, we fought some really hard games and made some good steps as a team,” freshman Devan Kennifer said. “But now that both teams have seen each other, it will be really interesting to see which teams respond next weekend.” BUCKNELL 14, HARVARD 13In Harvard’s last game of the tournament, the Crimson started out strong in what would be a hard-fought match. Both teams switched leads throughout the game, with Harvard beginning on the upside, up 5-1.Bucknell (6-5) slowly chipped away at Harvard’s advantage, coming within two points of the Crimson at 7-5 as the first half drew to a close.Starting the second half, Harvard would again claim a lead at 11-9, but the Bison soon pulled ahead 13-12. In the last minute of the game, freshman Ita Barton-Kettleborough scored a goal for the Crimson, giving Harvard hope of either a win or chance to play in overtime.But penalties would again destroy the Crimson’s chances. On a Villanova power play, Bison Valentina Rozas snuck a shot past captain Nicola Perlman, who is also a former Crimson magazine chair, and into the net with six seconds left in the game.  HARVARD 14, GEORGE WASHINGTON 4Prior to the loss against Bucknell, Harvard dealt the Colonels (1-4) a crushing 14-4 defeat. The Crimson opened the game at a slow pace, scoring only one goal in the first. GW also kicked off the game at a crawl and could only respond with one goal. But while the Colonels continued to stall, Kennifer and freshman Monica Zdrojewski amped up the pace. Complemented by two goals from Barton-Kettleborough, the freshman duo contributed a hat trick apiece. Harvard never looked back.Leading 6-3 at the half, the Crimson saw a shot each served up by junior Roxanne Pinto, freshman Shannon Purcell, junior Kristina Berquist, and sophomore Patricia Smith, throughout the second half. Harvard mounted a relentless barrage against GW goalie Charlotte Schou, while receiving two saves from Perlman, Harvard boasted a 10-point advantage as the final whistle blew. PRINCETON 10, HARVARD 8Harvard’s win over GW was a testament to the team’s mental and physical strength after suffering a close defeat the night before against league foe Princeton (7-1). In a game similar to last year’s 14-10 loss, the Crimson fell behind the Tigers early, trailing 3-2 at halftime. After a strong attack from the Princeton offense, Harvard found itself frustrated and down by six. Attempting to earn the come-from-behind win, the Crimson released an onslaught of four consecutive goals while Perlman remained stalwart and collected 10 saves throughout the game. Despite the second-half heroics, however, the team could not surpass the Tigers and eventually fell, 10-8, in a bittersweet loss.“We walked away a little disappointed that we lost but happy that we stuck it to them until the very end,” junior Kelly Peeler said.HARVARD 11, VILLANOVA 2Earlier Saturday morning, the Crimson came out strong against the Wildcats (0-5), scoring seven points in the first half as Villanova lacked the force to muster a single goal. Harvard’s chain of shots began with Kennifer, who scored four times against the Wildcats throughout the game. Purcell would continue the momentum, putting two more in the back of the Villanova’s net while Perlman denied all Wildcat attempts in the first quarter.Freshman goaltender Laurel McCarthy took the net for the last three quarters, stopping four shots and allowing only two scores.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 1000 times the ball has floated gracefully through the air, perched just above the net for a salivating hitter.
Over 1000 times, various members of the Harvard men’s volleyball team have converted these perfect gifts into crushing kills, skillfully pummeling the ball to the ground.
And yet, over 1000 times, this seminal moment that brings crowds to their feet has hinged on one man’s performance—junior setter Gil Weintraub.
The third year star and co-captain notched his 1000th career assist this past week, showing vast improvement in only his second year as the squad’s on-court leader. In nearly every possession, Weintraub orchestrates the Crimson attack with precision and finesse, exhibiting a steady sense of leadership that is not lost on his teammates.
“Gil is essentially our quarterback,” fellow co-captain Brady Weissbourd says. “Every game we win or lose is based on Gil and he’s been doing everything he can to help us win games.”
Faced with such a burden but perhaps lacking the glory of football’s most revered position, the role of setter might deter greedier athletes; however, Weintraub has embraced his extraordinary penchant for setting the stage for teammates’ memorable moments.
“That’s just the nature of the game,” Weintraub laughs while describing his role. “My job is to make other people look good and I’m okay with that. It’s fun, though, because it means I get to touch every ball.”
The extent to which Weintraub has become the lynchpin of the offense reflects clearly in the setter’s gaudy numbers. After finishing 16th in the nation last year with 11.29 assists per game, the junior has upped his production to 11.60 per game, notching 348 of the team’s 371 assists thus far.
Weintraub’s 37 digs and nine service aces both also rank second on the team—indicators of the co-captain’s all-around contribution. But, through two stellar seasons it has become apparent that Weintraub’s trademark lies in setting the table.
“[Gil] has been playing great,” says Weissbourd, the team leader in kills. “I play a position where every set needs to be quick and the timing needs to be right. It’s great to have a setter as talented [as him].”
Weintraub has certainly earned such praise lately, posting unparalleled efforts as the 2009 campaign unfolds. Following a career-high 63-assist performance against Stevens Institute of Technology in January, Weintraub capped last week’s five-set win against Newbury with 67 helpers.
Considering the junior is on pace to shatter last year’s total of 621 assists, Weintraub does not seem particularly fixated with personal stats or glory.
“One thousand is a pretty sweet number, I’m not going to lie, but I’ve only been setting for two years, so I don’t know [how much] it means,” he says. “I think it does mean that we’re gelling as a team. 1000 assists means a lot of kills.”
With this quick deflection of personal accolades towards team praise, Weintraub sends a reminder that his prowess in competition mirrors his skill as a team captain. Despite only two years on the court, the junior’s hard work and consistent play have validated his early election by teammates and earned head coach Brian Baise’s admiration.
“From early on [Weintraub]’s work ethic has really set an example for the entire team,” Baise says. “As a captain, he’s been a leader on and off the court, in a position that has a lot of responsibility.”
Displaying characteristic humility, Weintraub gives a more modest self-assessment, revealing a desire to improve his leadership skills.
“It’s hard being a junior captain, and I still have a lot to learn,” Weintraub admits. “But, I really try to bring the team as close together as possible and mostly do what captains do: try to lead, be a friend, and motivate.”
With a year and a half remaining in his career, Weintraub has ample opportunity to grow as a leader and as a difference-maker for Harvard. The setter hopes that the team can evolve in that time as well. With the Crimson sitting at .500 for the season, Weintraub sees his squad at a crossroads, primed to assert itself in the EIVA.
However, as Harvard looks to build momentum after defeating Newbury and ending a two-game skid, Weintraub’s career effort against the Nighthawks demonstrates how much the team’s fate rides on the man at the helm.
“The decisions that [Weintraub] is making on offense are improving every match,” Baise says. “To me there were signs [against Newbury] that we’re starting to make some progress and much of that is a tribute to Gil and the plays he’s calling.”
Fortunately for the Crimson, Weintraub appears to be hitting his stride just at the midway point of his tenure. Before the setter hangs up his jersey, delighted fans at the MAC can look forward to another 1000 perfectly arching feeds, building anticipation for another 1000 devastating strikes. And all the while, the man who makes Harvard’s offense click will smile in the background, content to humbly showcase his teammates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat. As a sportswriter, capturing that is supposed to be my weekly task. 
I’ve been on the women’s hockey beat for more than a year, and I suppose you can say my experience has been an atypical one. I’ve gotten plenty of practice writing about victories, but it wasn’t until last month that I actually witnessed the team lose. 
Crazy, right? In case you aren’t a women’s hockey aficionado, a little bit of context. 
Last year, Harvard was beyond good. The Crimson went undefeated in the conference, lost just once in the regular season, and rode a 21-game win streak all the way to the national semifinals where the team was bounced by powerhouse Wisconsin.
But let’s get one thing straight: this is not last year’s Crimson. 
Not everything came so easily for Harvard this time around. The team got swept on the road twice in November. Injuries befell starters Jenny Brine and Cori Bassett, causing them to miss a combined eight games. Superstars Sarah Vaillancourt and Christina Kessler umderwent prolonged absences to play for their respective Canadian national teams. The Crimson’s powerful offense was mired in a frustrating slump.
And after a loss to Dartmouth on Jan. 6, Harvard found itself in an unfamiliar position. With the end of the regular season just a few weeks away, the team sat under .500 and, for the first time in years, was left out of any conversation about the NCAA playoffs. 
Credit it to whatever you like: the pressure of living up to astronomically high expectations, a tough early-season road schedule, or just plain bad luck.
But, as Crimson coach Katey Stone has been known to say, you have to make your own luck. And in the second half of the season, that’s just what the resurgent Harvard team has done.
Since its 5-3 win at Brown on Jan. 9, the Crimson has gone undefeated in the ECAC. The offense has exploded, averaging 3.77 goals per game over the last 13 contests. 
Vaillancourt’s rebounded as well, with 30 of her team-leading 47 points coming in that stretch. Kessler’s only four shutouts on the season have been in the last 12 games. Harvard’s two top offensive lines are firing on all cylinders, and special teams have been a strength.
It’s clear to any spectator that the Crimson has put its early-season struggles behind it. In short, Harvard is playing its best hockey at just the right time. 
The only two losses in the last seven weeks were nail-biters against Hockey East titans No. 5 New Hampshire and No. 6 Boston College. In both, the Crimson arguably outplayed its opponent, only to be foiled first by the Eagles’ excellent goaltender and second by a Wildcat overtime power-play goal.
Of course, there’s a little bit of extra luck that Harvard couldn’t control. The Crimson had trailed the Big Green in the conference standings all season, but Dartmouth failed to win any of its last four ECAC contests. A Princeton upset of league-leading St. Lawrence on Valentine’s Day helped set up last Friday’s showdown between Harvard and the Saints for the league title.
That’s when the Crimson took advantage of the fortunate opening. With the league title on the line, Harvard clobbered St. Lawrence, 4-0, and Clarkson, 6-1, to jump from third to first in just over a week and prove that it’s the team to beat in the conference playoffs.
Same result as last year, different route. But this year’s Crimson is a much better team for the difficulties it has overcome. 
Last week, after that crushing 3-2 overtime loss to New Hampshire, it would have been understandable if Harvard came out hesitantly against the Saints. 
Instead, the Crimson did just the opposite. 
Vaillancourt, as she is wont to do, took control of the game. With two beautiful goals (that you can see for yourself at thecrimson.com!) in the opening ten minutes, she ensured that her team dictated the pace of the game right from the beginning. 
It’s hard to talk about the Crimson’s resurgence without acknowledging Vaillancourt. After being crowned the best player in collegiate women’s hockey last March, you can expect her name to once again be among the finalists for the Patty Kazmaier award when they are announced next week.
Though her limited early-season production may hamper her chances for a repeat—and it seems like Mercyhurst junior Meghan Agosta, twice a top-three finalist for the award and currently averaging an absurd 2.60 points per game, might be overdue—nobody’s played better in the last month than Vaillancourt. 
But the tri-captain is just one cog in a team that needs all hands on deck to earn a spot in and advance through the NCAA tournament.
Harvard has shaken off preseason expectations and redefined itself on its own terms. Led by its veterans, the Crimson has gained confidence, fought back from tough deficits, and learned from its missteps. When it would have been easy to give up and write the season off as a disappointment, that’s when Harvard revealed its true character.
This isn’t last year’s Crimson, but one thing remains the same—the goal of winning the ECAC tournament, and making a run at that elusive national title, is well within its reach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a combination of aggressive board-snatching and lethal post play, sophomore Emma Markley has made playing the three spot look too easy.
Throughout the season, the Crimson has been playing a run-and-gun system, one that allows guards and perimeter shooters to shine. Markley, however, has been dominating her opposing forwards, and when the weekend proved that shooting wasn’t going to be the only way win, Markley stepped up to meet the pressures that Harvard was facing.
“I’m really glad that I can score for the team,” Markley said. “It’s an honor to step on court whether I can score two points or fifteen points on the night.”
Against Princeton on Friday, the team was shooting a dismal 14.8 percent after the first half.The Crimson adjusted to the situation, changing to a more physical game plan to overcome a 22-point deficit. Harvard looked for its big players and Markley responded. 
“I couldn’t believe that we had to be down by 22 points to finally start stepping it up,” Markley said. “We knew it was going to be a hard fight but we chipped at the lead and finally overtook them.”
The sophomore ended up with 16 points and eight rebounds, using her interior presence to provide space for the guards to recover on the offensive front.  
“Emma Markley, when she starts strong, is really tough to defend,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
“If Emma Markley is feeling good, she’s going to score in several different ways.”
Markley must have felt great the next day. The near double-double was followed up by a spectacular performance on Saturday against Penn.
Markley scored 23 points and had a game-high 14 rebounds, securing her seventh pair of double figures of the season. 
She was critical in the first half, contributing six to a 15-point stretch that distanced Harvard from the Quakers. Her major point contribution came in the second half when she stepped up again to stave off Penn. Markley made two shots late in the fourth quarter that denied the Quakers any possibility for a comeback.
Delaney-Smith had only a simple but engrossing phrase for Markley’s play. “[Markley] is wonderful.”
Markley, a Yorktown, N.Y. native, has settled into the role of a premier offensive option for the Crimson. This has been a breakout season for the sophomore, who saw limited playing time during her freshman year. 
“My second year on the team has come with improved play and better chemistry between my teammates and me,” Markley said.
Markley, last week’s Ivy League Player of the Week for the third time this campaign, was rewarded for her efforts against Cornell and Columbia, a weekend split that saw her average a stellar 22.5 points, 12 rebounds, and five blocks.
“I just think I’ve been stronger and I’ve been able to adapt well with everyone on the court,” Markley said. “As we play more, we learn each other’s tendencies, and that makes the team better.”
As opposed to the nine minutes a game she played last year, Markley has spent more time on the court with her teammates this season, averaging 26.4 minutes a game along with team highs of 14.1 points and 7.6 boards. She’s also been a defensive presence, averaging 1.6 blocks and .95 steals a game. Her field goal percentage is a solid .523. 
Though Markley has been individually dazzling, she realizes that it takes more than her career highs to win games.
“We have great energy and talent,” Markley said. “Playing with this group of girls has really improved my game and has made the team successful thus far.”

Have you ever read “The Wasteland,” and thought, this poem would be a lot better if T.S. Eliot had put in a crazy rabbit and a caterpillar smoking hookah? 
Look no farther than poet Ann Lauterbach’s “Alice in the Wasteland.” That’s right, Lewis Carroll’s little blonde heroine wanders into Modernist verse. 
Lauterbach will be lecturing tonight at 6 p.m. in the Thompson Room of the Barker Center.  Preview her verse—and analysis of what makes bad poetry bad— after the jump. 
From a Boston Review essay:
Bad poetry, I would submit, asks questions, raises issues, makes complaints, marks territories. Bad poetry does not take on the more difficult task, where the question and its answer are as one… Or put it this way: the poem is an answer to a question or questions no one, including the poet, had thought to ask.

Retired to their books
 
Here are the stones
Loosed from their settings
 
Here is the bridge
Over the water
 
Here is the place
Where the sun came up
 
Here is a season
Dry in the fireplace.
 
Here are the ashes.
The days are beautiful.

Well yes, when Harvard Men's Lacrosse beats Duke 9-6 on Sunday.
Stepping off the plane from Durham around 12am this morning, the boys headed over to Currier, where they kept Currier residents awake raging in the Solarium until past 3:30 in the Morning. Are Sundays the new Thursday night? Maybe for the lacrosse team...
What's on the agenda for tonight? While the boys can't party on nights before practice—due to a team rule recently invoked by the captains—eager undergraduates can head over to Uno's and toast to a good cause (not to say Lacrosse victories aren't...) Habitat for Humanity will be raising funds for their 2009 spring break trip in Guatemala. Be sure to turn in a Habitat for Humanity flyer with your tab, and 20% of the proceeds will help build a house for a family in need.
