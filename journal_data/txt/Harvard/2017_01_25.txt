After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If things go the way Donald Trump wants, Obama may be better remembered for his jokes at correspondents’ dinners than  his policy accomplishments.
In all fairness, Obama’s jokes were hilarious. His comically inspiring speeches cheered at least half of the country and his warmth endeared him as “one of us” to the rest of the country. Here was a hilarious, hip-hop loving, hoops shooting president who took joy slumming it with the ordinary folks. His passionate pleas after national tragedies inspired tears and his public addresses inspired optimism. Fandom over his bromance with Joe Biden and his bromance with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau is certain to linger for a while longer.
Obama was a natural showman. He seemed to understand that the key to wooing millennials is not just promises of free college but also surprise appearances in popular shows like Jimmy Fallon or the Colbert Report. Take an already charismatic president and let him stand tall on shoulders of  television celebrities—the Obama family stole several nights’ limelight. Everything he did had half the country cheering behind him.
I learned about Obama when I was in my formative years in Nepal. For a little boy from a country with rampant corruption that had just ended an armed civil conflict, Obama’s message of unity and hope resonated with and inspired my young psyche. His charisma and energy transcended national boundaries—my little school was electrified when he won the presidency eight years ago and was reelected four years later. For the next five years, I, together with many others, reveled in his inspirational presence delivered through appearances on shows and meticulously crafted speeches.
It was only after spending a year in the US that I began to realize that despite the confidence and optimism of his rhetoric, his years in office had disappointed not just detractors on the political right but also his ardent supporters on the left. While the little boy in me still marvels at his charismatic character, my enthusiasm for change has long since been tempered.
Behind the veneer of a candid president, journalists saw the emergence of a very opaque administration. When he was campaigning for president in 2008, he slammed the secrecy of Bush’s administration and pledged for a more transparent government. In the eight years of his presidency, he not only continued but broadened the secrecy he inherited from Bush. Some even go further to claim that the precedent set by Obama in curtaining transparency will empower Trump to target the press and journalists.
In retrospect, it is a surprise to anyone why Obama was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. Obama, the anti-war candidate, leaves a legacy of active combat for two full terms. The details of his expanded covert operations are unknowable. Having inherited drone technology from Bush, Obama put it to use in a way that wouldn’t appease those who were hoping for a more pacific administration.
The crown-jewel of Obama administration, the Affordable Care Act, helped millions but also earned disapproval even from the left who criticized him for not being progressive enough. The Democratic Party eventually fractured over these disappointments — the zeal that earned Obama the presidency was largely tempered towards the end of his presidency. And during that period, Democrats would lose over a thousand federal and state seats, weakening the Democratic power in government and paving the way for Donald Trump.
Obama, the eternal showman, foreseeing the dissents behind him, spent the final years of his presidency trying to secure his legacy by repeatedly asserting his modest accomplishments, be it by slow-jamming on Jimmy Fallon’s show or by publishing in scholarly publications. In October 2016, he published a piece in the Economist outlining his aspirations for the national economy. He writes for Medium, the blogging platform en vogue. He is even published in Science, the celebrated science journal, and the Harvard Law Review. For once, academia, which remains largely neglected by politicians, enjoyed attention from the land’s highest office. This short-lived relationship was unprecedented in recent memory and, perhaps, unlikely to be repeated in the near future.
It must have been clear to him that it would be impossible to please everyone. Throughout his presidency, he rode high, fraternizing with a pantheon of pop culture celebrities and publishing in scholarly fashion. Half of the country loved him for it, and the other half resented all of it as mere displays of East Coast elitism. It seems that at some point, he just gave up trying to persuade the other side. The readers of Science are unlikely to be the same demographic of Breitbart. The demographic of Medium is fairly young, too, and viewers of the Colbert Report and Jimmy Fallon were already on his side.
These links with pop culture and academia weren’t instruments to expand his political reach but rather half-desperate measures to make sure that those who were behind him when he started would be with him when he left — to ensure that, in light of the Trump presidency that threatens his major works, his efforts were remembered. As Michelle Obama might have said, “When they go low, we make sure our high gets credited.”
This was indeed a presidency of contradictions. The emblem of racial progress who leaves office with race-relations in a precarious state. The Peace Prize-winning president who was complicit in unknown numbers of unaccounted deaths. The voice of reason who witnessed the utter defenestration of reason from public sphere. A president who inspired millions worldwide but couldn’t inspire confidence in his own work.
It cannot, however, be denied that Obama, an optimistic leader with a great deal of showmanship, will for long be a role-model for millions of children worldwide. Now, with his flippant successor in office in his stead, his pragmatism, zeal and optimism will be missed. Farewell, Mr. Obama!

A new study recently featured in The New York Times revealed significant inconsistencies regarding economic diversity at colleges around the country, Harvard included. There is a particularly strong association between family income and enrollment at the nation’s top universities, collectively called  “Ivy plus” schools. According to the report, 67 percent of Harvard students come from families that have income levels in the top 20 percent, and the median income of the families of Harvard students is $168,800, placing Harvard in the top three percent of colleges in regard to both median income and top 20 percent of income levels. With these statistics, Harvard is under greater scrutiny for the large disparities in the economic makeup of its students.
Unfortunately, these numbers do not come as a surprise. The wealthiest percentiles of the nation’s population have historically been overrepresented in the admitted classesof Harvard and other “Ivy plus” institutions. The Harvard Admissions Office must take heed of this important report and continue to strive to make each incoming class as socioeconomically diverse as possible. Furthermore, the University should increase its local and national outreach, reaching students with relevant financial information and helpful college-prep programs like Crimson Summer Academy before the college application process even begins.
Harvard’s groundbreaking financial aid initiatives have been instrumental in dismantling barriers for low-income students to afford the cost of attending. However, the disproportionate amount of wealthy students affects the overall campus culture, which presents an environment that is unwelcoming and even discouraging for students from low-income backgrounds who consider applying. Students who are qualified need to be made aware that Harvard is an actual possibility for them, and this can only be done by more widespread outreach before senior year of high school. Moreover, giving these students the opportunity to attend Harvard regardless of their financial status is only half of the battle when, once admitted, they still do not feel like they have a place among their wealthier counterparts. University administration needs to ensure low-income students have the resources to know that they too have a claim to Harvard, so that they will not just matriculate, but stay and eventually graduate.
While the report revealed information about institutions of higher education across the nation, it is important that Harvard and other elite schools with more financial resources stand separately in consideration. They are held to a different standard and must be expected to act accordingly. We cannot blame the University for the national socioeconomic disparity, but it is fair to call on the administration to close the gaps in economic status that exist on campus and manifest themselves in student life. Harvard must commit to a socioeconomically diverse student body, but more importantly, Harvard must continue to prioritize this diversity for the good of every student’s experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The election of Donald Trump has revealed a clear disconnect between the vox populi in the Rust Belt and their representation in the mainstream media. Throughout the presidential election, most respected news organizations such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and the election forecast website FiveThirtyEight, failed to capture the anti-Clinton sentiment in the Rust Belt and other working class areas. Writing in retrospect, these news organizations claim they underestimated the power of “whitelash”—the working class white response to eight years with a black President.
As a Clinton supporter who relied on these news outlets throughout the election, I, like many others in the Harvard community, was shocked on that fateful November night. It seemed impossible that Donald Trump, who had been considered a lost cause, was racking up electoral vote after electoral vote. How could the news sources we trusted have gotten everything so wrong?
The answer is that the media did not pick up on the beliefs of the working class whites who voted Trump into office. However, the news sources that did accurately reflect these undercurrents in American society, such as Fox News, Breitbart News, and Glenn Beck’s news network theBlaze, are often denigrated by the liberal elite as offensive and therefore irrelevant. Trump’s appointment of Stephen K. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, as White House Chief Strategist means we must recognize that, in Trump’s America, what is offensive can no longer be ignored.
The polarization of news has made it such that the information we read confirms our own political biases. Daily, I get my news from The New York Times and The Washington Post. When I am procrastinating on social media, I find myself surrounded by liberal clickbait articles from news sources like Mic or Buzzfeed. And in my day-to-day discourse with peers at Harvard, I’m hard-pressed to find myself in a discussion without universally socially liberal opinions. When I do find peers with alternate viewpoints, disagreement often means labelling these viewpoints as racist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic. Sometimes these labels are accurate, but they do nothing to change opinions.
Listening to offensive statements or alternate viewpoints does not mean we are elevating or agreeing with them. In fact, only by listening to them can we begin to formulate a strategy for confronting them. Throughout the election, the Clinton campaign failed to produce a message that resonated with millions of Americans, while these alternate viewpoints prevailed. If the Democratic establishment had understood the pervasiveness of Trump’s message, it could have formulated a better strategy for combatting it than simply denouncing Trump as racist. Moving forward, Democrats in Congress will have no choice but to accept the pervasiveness of alternate views and respond to them with compromise.
Earlier this month, I watched a clip from The Daily Show in which the show’s host, Trevor Noah, interviewed conservative pundit Tomi Lahren, host of the popular nightly show "Tomi", which airs on theBlaze. In her interview with Noah, Lahren made a number of outlandish statements, including one comparing the Black Lives Matter movement to the KKK. Noah was heavily criticized for giving Lahren a broader platform, but doing so was the only way to expose her followers’ shockingly widespread beliefs to his audience.
Noah did what The New York Times failed to do during the 2016 election. Lahren’s answers disturbed me, but they also gave me insight into the beliefs of an entire segment of the country I have never encountered before because they are ignored by the mainstream and primarily liberal media. This one-sided coverage is dangerous because it exacerbates the political polarization in our country, moving our government away from productive compromise and towards outsider candidates like Donald Trump.
I therefore want to challenge liberals in the Harvard community to risk discomfort by reading “conservative” or even so-called “alt-right” media outlets and listening to their conservative peers. We cannot counter a conservative message if we do not allow ourselves to hear it.

Six months after resigning as the CEO of Harvard Management Company, Stephen Blyth has returned to teaching a statistics course in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Blyth, who stepped down from the helm of the University’s underperforming investment arm in late July after taking medical leave, will teach Statistics 123: “Applied Quantitative Finance” this semester. He said the course will feature material drawn from his 22 years of experience in the finance.
“The material of the course was really motivated by my experience in finance, and so almost by default uses examples from my career, probably from earlier in my career,” Blyth said. “The material is compelling and elegant.”
Blyth said that he left HMC to undergo cancer treatment and that the disease is “very susceptible to chemotherapy.”
“Fortunately it is very treatable. I’ve lost my hair, but not my appetite,” he said. “I’m dealing with it, but being back in the classroom is a good focus.”
According to Blyth, about 130 students have indicated interest in enrolling in his course, which met for the first time Tuesday afternoon. The course will begin with an introduction to basic finance vocabulary, and then explore the “fundamental theorem of asset pricing,” according to Blyth. Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability” is a prerequisite.
Blyth said he was unsure whether he will return to work at HMC.
Columbia’s former investment chief N.P Narvekar succeeded Blyth as the CEO of HMC in 2016, taking the reins of the company amid internal turmoil. In fiscal year 2016, Harvard posted its worst endowment returns since the financial crisis in 2009, returning negative 2 percent.
Blyth said the company is in “excellent hands” with Narvekar, who experts and financial analysts say could will restructure Harvard’s idiosyncratic investment model. Under its“hybrid” investment model, HMC retains an in-house staff and also hires outside firms to invest University funds. Most university endowments rely on outside funds.
The endowment’s value fell almost $2 billion in 2016, dropping from $37.6 billion to $35.7 billion. Several financial flows beyond Harvard’s poor investment returns affected the drop in endowment value, including the $1.7 billion distributed to fund over a third of Harvard’s annual budget in 2016.
The endowment’s performance is not the only challenge facing HMC: over the past few years, the company has faced significant internal turnover in its executive positions. Narvekar is the fourth HMC chief in the past decade. Jane L. Mendillo, who ran the company before Blyth, departed six years after inheriting the endowment at the offset of the financial crisis, and the company’s chief before her, Mohamed A. El-Erian, remained in his post for only a year and a half.
In comparison, HMC saw just one transition of leadership in its first 31 years of existence, and the Yale Investments Office has had the same chief executive since the Reagan administration.

UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 2:15 p.m. 
Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies opened its first field office in Tunisia last Tuesday in an effort to expand Harvard’s global presence and provide resources for scholarship in North Africa.
Hazem Ben-Gacem ’92, a London financier and former Lowell House resident, has donated an undisclosed sum for the office. Situated in Tunis, the new office joins more than eighteen Harvard international outposts, including locations in Botswana, China, and Chile.
A native Tunisian, Ben-Gacem said his primary motivation behind funding the office was to enable Harvard students to share in his enthusiasm for his country and immerse themselves in Tunisia’s history.
“The Harvard Office in Tunisia is a home for Harvard students away from home to broaden and continue their research, their education, their experience and know that there is a familiar environment,” Ben-Gacem said.
According to William Granara, the director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Tunisia is a unique country to study, offering both ancient history and modern institutions.
“Tunisia is both historically and geographically well-located,” Granara said. “Geographically, it is in the heart of the Mediterranean so it is a part of the Mediterranean world, it’s part of Africa so it’s part of the African world, it’s an Arab country so it’s part of the Arab world, it’s a Muslim country so it’s part of the Islamic world, and I think one can say it’s part of the broader Middle East.”
The Tunisia location will offer summer and January term programs for Harvard affiliates interested in studying Arabic, conducting research in Tunisia’s archives or institutions, and exploring the country’s history.
According to Granara, student response to its Tunisia office has been overwhelmingly positive. Last summer, before the center officially opened, graduate students participated in an intensive Arabic writing course and did research in the Tunisian archives over winter break.
While the Tunisian office’s new offerings are primarily for graduate students, Ben-Gacem said the office hopes to expand to provide undergraduates with similar programs.

When millions of demonstrators gathered across the country on Jan. 21 to march for women’s rights, many criticized the protest for its lack of diversity. Some Harvard students who participated in the Boston’s Women’s March agree, saying that the protest could have represented a wider variety of perspectives.
The Women’s March, which happened in hundreds of U.S. cities Saturday, addressed the importance of women’s rights following President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
In Boston, hundreds from Harvard joined a crowd of 175,000 protesters to advocate for women’s, immigrant, and minority rights. Despite the range of issues presented at the march, some thought the protest was more inclusive to white, cisgender women than others.
For Eriko M. Kay ’17, who participated in the march on Saturday, a focus on traditional femininity was disappointing.
“It definitely did focus on the experiences of white women and a very cisgendered definition of women as well. I think there were many communities that were left out and many experiences that were left [out],” Kay said.
To Kay, pink, a color adorned by many marchers, is a “racialized” color that is more pertinent to white women than people of color. She also said several protesters’ signs had “graphic” depictions of female anatomy which may have excluded gender non-conforming and transgender women.
Sally Chen ’18, who also participated in the march, said she was bothered by some chants that referenced female anatomy, saying she preferred more gender-neutral statements such as “my body, my rights.”
“The Women’s March ideally would be more conscientious of our trans sisters as well,” Chen said. “That was probably one thing that bothered me a little bit.”
Others said that women of color were underrepresented during the march. Many demonstrators from Harvard and around the United States took to social media after the march, saying they were concerned with the protest’s large number of white women.
Others, meanwhile, said they saw adequate minority representation.
Students from Harvard Law School organized a breakfast and rally before the march, featuring speakers from several of the school’s cultural affinity groups such as La Alianza and the Black Law Students Association. According to Kristin A. Turner, president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, the rally garnered a crowd of about 200 students.
Turner said she was pleased to see an emphasis on issues affecting people of color, even though some said the Boston march was predominantly white.
“I was definitely very pleasantly surprised to see as many Black Lives Matter signs and especially those being held by non-black colleagues,” Turner said. “I like the endorsement of immigrant’s rights and worker’s rights.”
Paavani Garg, vice president of the Harvard Law Women’s Law Association, agreed, adding that going forward, she hopes to see continued support for non-white women.
“There’s not just work to be done for women, but there’s work to be done for women of color as well,” Garg said. “I think that we need to keep discussing this in the future, so people are more attuned to this idea of whose right are they really fighting for. Is it the entire gender or just facets of the gender, which is just not okay?”
Natalie D. Vernon, president of the Harvard Law Women’s Law Association, also noted that involvement of people from all racial backgrounds might promote a more unified charge for women’s rights and that differences in background may account for better activism in the future.
“Some women have more experience through what life has thrown at them with resisting, protesting, pushing back, calling out violence, noting oppression,” Vernon said. “I think some women maybe not have been exposed to that as much.”

Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe has joined a legal team suing President Donald Trump, arguing that Trump’s ownership of the Trump Organization violates a clause of the United States Constitution.
The suit, filed Jan. 23 in federal court, alleges that transactions between foreign governments and Trump’s business holdings, including hotel room purchases and leases in Trump’s towers, violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. The clause prevents individuals holding offices of “Profit or Trust” from accepting “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”  The suit includes summons for Trump.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the plaintiff in the case, is a Washington, D.C.-based organization that seeks to reduce the influence of money in politics. The organization has also filed a complaint separate from this suit, charging that a lease one of Trump’s companies owns on the Old Post Office Building in D.C violates a conflict of interest clause in the lease.
Trump announced in a press conference earlier this month that he has turned leadership and management of the Trump Organization, his international business conglomerate, over to his sons and a long-time company executive in a trust for the duration of his presidency. But Trump still maintains ownership of the company, and his attorneys have said that this separation resolves any potential conflicts of interest.
Trump’s lawyers declined to comment for this story, though Trump called the lawsuit "totally without merit" at a White House event Monday.
Tribe said in an interview that current arrangements fails to fix violations of the Emoluments Clause.
“The Emoluments Clause has nothing to do with how busy you are managing, it’s about whether you own something,” Tribe said. “As long as he maintains ownership of this vast business empire that can be benefited financially in dozens and hundreds of ways by many countries that want to gain his favor, he hasn’t avoided the Emoluments Clause.”
Other legal organizations have challenged also Trump’s business arrangements. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a Freedom of Information Act Request asking various government agencies for information about Trump’s business dealings and financial statements. The ACLU has also said it is looking into filing a suit against Trump about the Emoluments Clause.
Tribe said he welcomed additional lawsuits filed against Trump, saying “the more, the better.”
“There are likely to be quite a few lawsuits, but I’m convinced that we’ve put together the strongest combination of plaintiffs and lawyers that we could imagine and we plan to go forward, and certainly welcome the ACLU and others with other litigation,” Tribe said.
Many Harvard students, professors, and alumni have vocally opposed Trump and his administration. Earlier this month, 16 Harvard Law professors, including Tribe, signed a letter opposing U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions’s nomination as United States attorney general. Students have also gathered in protest of Trump’s campaign promises.

Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards Union, Harvard’s smallest union, will begin federal mediation with the University on Jan. 30 and Feb. 2, marking the next step in contract negotiations that have lasted months.
The union and the University have been negotiating a new contract for the approximately 80-person union since June 30, when HUSPMGU’s contract expired. Union organizers say that the the two parties have yet to agree on compensation levels and benefits for the employees.
During federal mediation, a mediator will be present during bargaining sessions to help the two parties reach an agreement. According to Curt E. Rheault, an HUSPMGU organizer, members of the union are demanding higher wages in their new contract, as well as more personal days and vacation time.
“We've paid the price for being small and independent and Harvard's taken advantage of it,” said Sean F. McNally, a HUSPMGU organizer. “It's apparent in our wages and benefits.”
He also said that the University has not offered the security and museum parking workers the same wages and benefits granted to other union employees.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that the University compensates the security and museum parking employees competitively.
“The HUSPMGU agreement is consistent with other represented groups on campus and provides competitive wages and benefits to those in the respective industries—in this case, Parking and Museum Attendants,” she wrote.
HUSPMGU organizers also argue that the rising healthcare costs make it more difficult for its employees to pay for the University’s plan. In her statement, deLuzuriaga wrote that the University’s “modest changes to insurance offerings” are in line with rising healthcare costs across the country and create “tiered premiums and reimbursement programs to protect lower-wage workers.”
This development in HUSPMGU’s contract negotiations comes after the union attempted to merge with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the largest union at the University that represents thousands of workers. After a majority of HUSPMGU members voted to merge with HUCTW last year, the University did not allow the two unions to combine, and the two unions did not bring their merger to the National Labor Relations Board.
HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said that he hopes HUSPMGU is able to successfully negotiate a new contract with the University even though the two unions did not merge.
Jaeger also said that HUCTW has supported HUSPMGU during the contract negotiations, helping the union with topics like Harvard’s health plan and the University’s finances.
But, unlike Harvard’s negotiations with the University’s dining workers, who went on strike for three weeks in the fall, the security and museum parking employees will stay on the job throughout negotiations. McNally said that under current labor law, the employees in the HUSPMGU cannot go on strike because of the legal categorization of the union’s contract.
“We’re hopeful that some sort of agreement will be reached, otherwise we’re going to be negotiating for a long time,” McNally said.

The all-male Oak Club will adopt gender neutral membership practices during this spring’s recruitment process, according to the social club’s undergraduate president.
Undergraduate members and alumni made the decision after “a referendum in which a club-wide consensus to make this move was reached,” Jeremy D. Welborn ’18, the Oak’s president, wrote in an emailed statement.
The move makes the Oak the first all-male social group to change its membership practices following the announcement of historic penalties for members of Harvard’s single-gender social organizations—a designation that includes Greek organizations, most final clubs, and organizations like the Oak.
Those penalties, which will first take effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender groups from receiving College endorsement for post-graduate fellowships and holding leadership positions in recognized student groups or varsity captaincies.
Welborn declined to comment on the influence the sanctions had on the Oak’s decision to become gender neutral. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana did not comment on administrative involvement in the change, though he did praise the Oak’s decision.
“I applaud the leaders and members of the Oak Club for their efforts to help create a more equitable and inclusive Harvard,” Khurana added.
Neither a traditional final club nor a nationally-affiliated Greek organization, the Oak occupies a unique place among Harvard’s single-gender social groups. The organization, founded in Jan. 2005, is relatively young and, unlike its final club counterparts, does not own a clubhouse in the Square. According to its website, the Oak descends from Harvard’s chapter of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity.
The original Delta Upsilon chapter—along with many of Harvard’s other fraternities at the time—privatized in the 1940s and became the all-male D.U. Club, which closed in 1995.
Today’s Oak Club comes from a subsequent Harvard chapter of Delta Upsilon, established in 1999, though it “still embodies many of the original DU principles,” according to the club’s website.
The Oak joins the Spee and Fox Clubs as all-male social groups that have added women to their ranks in recent years. The Spee was the first to invite women to participate in its punch process in September 2015, officially becoming gender neutral when it elected a class of both men and women later that fall.
Undergraduates of the Fox also decided to accept women into their membership in October 2015, writing in a letter to alumni that Harvard had “forced [their] hand” and pressured them into accepting women as members of the club. Members of the club’s graduate board sharply contested the decision, resulting in a contentious divide within the club. In a club-wide referendum in August, supporters of adding women to the club narrowly failed to meet the two-thirds threshold required by club policy.
Unlike the Oak, both the Fox and the Spee invited women into their ranks before the May announcement of the College’s new policy. Two all-female groups, the Sablière Society and the Seneca, have adopted gender neutral policies in the wake of the College’s sanctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The median family income for Harvard undergraduates is $168,800—more than three times the national median, according to a recent study.
With an average student at the 79th income percentile, Harvard’s median family income was the third-lowest in the Ivy League: Brown, with a $204,200 median family income, ranked first. The national median household income in 2015 was $55,775, according to Census data.
The study also ranked Harvard first in the Ivy League, but below most other colleges, in its enrollment of undergraduates from low and moderate-income families.
Among the twelve “Ivy League and selected elite colleges”—which also include M.I.T., Stanford, Duke, and the University of Chicago in the study—Harvard had the eighth largest proportion of students from the top 1 percent, with 15.1 percent of its undergraduates coming from households making over $630,000 per year. Students from this socioeconomic bracket were most strongly represented at Dartmouth, filling over one-fifth of the student body.
Raj Chetty ’00, John N. Friedman ’02, Emmanuel Saez, Nicholas Turner, and Daniel F. Yagan ’06 conducted the analysis, using anonymous tax and attendance records to evaluate thousands of colleges.
“Broadly, we’re interested in an era where more and more people are concerned about the American Dream fading,” Chetty, a Stanford economics professor who previously taught at Harvard, said. “Lots of people are very frustrated that they can no longer get ahead or do better than their parents did, for example.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 credited Harvard’s recent financial aid initiatives for the University's relatively greater representation of low income students compared to the rest of the Ivy League. Fitzsimmons said that the launch of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative and membership in the American Talent Initiative and Coalition for Access, Affordability, and Success has helped expand access to low- and moderate-income students.
“Families with annual incomes of $65,000 or less do not pay anything toward the cost of their child’s Harvard education,” Fitzsimmons wrote in a statement. “And one in five undergraduates is from a family with annual income of $65,000 or less.”
Still, the study ranks Harvard among the worst colleges nationwide at enrolling lower-income students. With 4.5 percent of students from the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution, Harvard ranks 2011th out of the 2395 schools for its proportion of low-income students.
Fitzsimmons wrote that Harvard has “significantly expanded” financial aid and outreach programs, such as the Harvard First Generation Program, the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, and the Harvard College Connection.
“We recognize, and are doing everything we can to address, the profound opportunity divide that exists in our country,” Fitzsimmons wrote.
In addition to socioeconomic background, the study also addresses how students at colleges move up or down the socioeconomic ladder. Chetty said that though Harvard ranks beneath most colleges by the study’s definition of mobility, which takes into account the number of low-income students at a college, he added that the relatively small number of lower-income students at Harvard do “exceptionally well” as compared to their higher-income peers.
“Among the low-income kids who get into Harvard, their outcomes look just as good as the kids from high-income families,” Chetty said. “That is an extremely important result because people have been worried for a long time that the low-income kids who get in might struggle at a place like Harvard because they haven’t had the same background, but the data show that that doesn’t really appear to be the case.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty-seven percent of Harvard undergraduates have completed the College’s online sexual assault prevention training module, half a year after the school first unveiled the program in September.
The training, intended to educate students about Harvard’s sexual harassment-related policies and resources, was spurred by a sexual conduct climate survey that found what University President Drew G. Faust deemed a “deeply disturbing” prevalence of sexual harassment and assault on campus. Students were originally required to complete the interactive module by the middle of October 2016, but faced no penalties for finishing the training late or not at all.
“Overall, I am really pleased with this response rate,” the College’s Title IX Coordinator Emily J. Miller wrote in an emailed statement. “ I would love for that final [third] to step up and complete the training because we need everyone on board to address this issue that affects our entire community.”
She added that the College continues to “encourage participation” from those who have yet to complete the module.
Harvard developed the online training system after a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention suggested mandating annual sexual assault prevention training for all Harvard undergraduates. The task force's final report specifically called for an online training platform.
Miller said she viewed the training module as a “pilot” of a future, more comprehensive program. She said she plans for the College to eventually release four iterations of the module every year, with each version tailored and delivered to students in each of the four class years.
Some Title IX experts said they were impressed with the two-thirds completion rate for what they called a “voluntary” training program, given students faced no punishment for failing to complete it.
“That’s extraordinary,” Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said of the module results. “I’m not the person to say if this is the most successful student training program ever, but it certainly got me to jump up out of the chair.”
Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, said she was also impressed by the completion rate. She said she believes the “high” percentage of students who chose to take the training indicates a “culture shift” may have taken place on Harvard’s campus.
“What we want is a total and complete culture shift from a culture that acknowledges and accepts rape as part of the culture to a culture that acknowledges and rejects rape in all forms,” she said. “To say that 67 percent of students willingly participated demonstrates to me a really big cultural shift.”
Others, however, said the College must do more to ensure that students are educated about issues surrounding sexual assault.
Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer with anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she thought Harvard should eventually make students’ ability to enroll in courses contingent on their completion of the sexual assault training module. She added that this policy would be the only way to ensure all students are “compelled” to get information about sexual assault.
Dickinson College general counsel Dana Scaduto suggested Harvard might consider adding to its portfolio of sexual assault education options in future, including potential in-person training sessions.
“I would say 67 percent in a voluntary model strikes me as a very good response rate, a good rate of interest, but it’s not high enough, and that’s why you need a variety of approaches,” she said.
She added: “You want to be sure that the other 33 percent of students have the level of information that the school wants them to have around this very important issue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: January 26, 2017 at 3:09 p.m.
You just can’t help but be impressed when you watch them play. There is quick ball movement, active defense, and an insatiable desire to find the open teammate. It’s an aesthetically pleasing brand of basketball.
On top of that, the Harvard women’s basketball team (14-1, 2-0 Ivy League) creates an atmosphere that its male counterpart may look to emulate. Big shots are greeted by raucous cheering and chest bumps. However, there is a sense that they’re playing solely for themselves, with the program generally lacking national attention.
With the regular season already more than halfway over, it would be criminal for anyone in the women’s basketball scene to ignore the Crimson. After an opening game loss at Minnesota with two freshmen starting their first collegiate game, the Ivy League heavyweight has overcome its youth and won 14 straight games to force its way into the national conversation.
Just this past week, Harvard received a lone vote in the AP Top 25 poll, the first it has garnered this season. The Crimson are also 30th in the RPI rankings, ahead of teams like Syracuse, Michigan, NC State, and Georgetown.
What does Harvard’s newest star, freshman point guard Katie Benzan, have to say about it?
“We haven’t even thought about [coverage],” Benzan said. “If we have national attention, that’s cool, but it doesn’t take away from the fact that we need to win the next game. We haven’t even reached our best yet, we aren’t even close, so we need to keep fighting, keep competing, keep working day-in and day-out.”
It is a mentality that has permeated the roster, but to see such focus from a player who has burst onto the scene the way that she has is remarkable. Through 15 collegiate games, Benzan leads the team with 12.7 points, 4.1 assists, and 2.7 three-pointers per game. She is the ninth-best most accurate three-point shooter in the nation, hitting 47.1% of her attempts.
What really makes this year’s Harvard team special, however, is its depth. Delaney-Smith calls it the “most balanced team I’ve ever coached.” Three different players, Benzan, co-captain Destiny Nunley, and sophomore guard Madeline Raster, average double figures in points. Freshman forward Jeannie Boehm, a former McDonald’s All-American, scores 7.7 points, grabs 6.8 rebounds, and blocks 2.6 shots per game but still flies under the radar.
Sophomore guards Nani Redford and Sydney Skinner are also capable of scoring in spurts, with junior forward Taylor Rooks providing key buckets off the bench. In fact, eight different players have scored at least 10 points in a game this season.
That balance has been on display in the biggest games of the season. The Crimson’s statement win, a 73-62 triumph over Temple, featured five players scoring in double figures. Boehm, expected to contribute heavily at the start of the year, only managed two points on 1-of-5 shooting but was dominant on defense, blocking two shots and holding Temple’s main scoring forward to 1-of-8 shooting. Nunley, as she did against La Salle, took over the contest with a game-high 21 points and allowed Boehm to focus on the other facets of her extremely versatile game.
Despite having the fourth-longest active winning streak in the country, behind Connecticut’s remarkable 92-game run, Harvard continues to lack the respect it deserves. Its strength of schedule rating is low despite matchups against Temple, La Salle, and Minnesota, but more harmful is its membership within the Ivy League. Two teams may have qualified for the tournament last year, but the conference still struggles to command respect on the national stage.
Harvard ranked fourth on ESPN’s most recent mid-major poll behind two teams comfortably behind it in terms of RPI. The team received zero votes in the most recent Coaches Poll. In ESPN’s most recent Bracketology, the Crimson was part of the “First Four Out,” with seven-loss Iowa placed in the projected field. Despite being 9-5 with a home loss to La Salle, a team Harvard beat on the road, Penn is still favored to win the Ivy League by pundits across the nation.
“The only way we’re going to get that respect is by beating the teams we’re supposed to beat by a larger margin,” Delaney-Smith suggests. “When the coaches do the polls, they ask, ‘Are you blowing teams out that you should blow out?’ That hurts us. We are unable to stretch the lead the way we should.”
Statistically, she’s right. Her team has only won two games by 15 points or more, while the Quakers have done it five times already. It is a primarily a function of Harvard’s youth, which involves four of the top five minute-getters being freshmen or sophomores.
That said, the polls and rankings aren’t properly valuing the team’s ability to grind out results. Even on off nights, the Crimson consistently finds ways to get it done. Upcoming Ivy tests will certainly put this team’s streak under the knife, but if there’s one thing to be learned from the team’s start, it’s not to underestimate this group.
Delaney-Smith, the winningest coach in Ancient Eight history, has seen some phenomenal squads during her tenure. She’s presided over the first two perfect seasons in Ivy League history. And yet, she wonders whether this may be the best team she’s had the privilege of coaching. It’s time for the rest of the country to take notice.

CORRECTION: January 26, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Harvard women's basketball team holds the nation's second-longest winning streak. In fact, it is the fourth-longest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most freshmen use their winter break to kick back, relax, and unwind after having completed their first semester of college. Adam Fox is not most freshmen.
A budding hockey star from Jericho, New York, Fox currently mans the blue line for the ninth-ranked Harvard men’s hockey team. But during his time off from school, the rookie swapped out Crimson for Red, White, and Blue.
After spending the last two years within USA Hockey’s National Team Development Program, Fox received the opportunity of a lifetime this winter—a chance to represent Team USA at the World Junior Championships in Canada.
Put on each year by the International Ice Hockey Federation, the World Junior Championships showcase the best under-20 talent from the top 10 hockey nations in the world. NHL legends like Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux as well as current stars like Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin have all played in the renowned competition, which originated in 1977.
In the 41st edition of the tournament, Fox’s turn arrived. And the Calgary Flames draft selection made good on his opportunity. Playing for gold on Jan. 5 in front of more than 20,000 spectators at the Bell Centre—home of the Montreal Canadiens—Fox had a field day against Team Canada. The defenseman tallied three assists, the last of which tied the tournament finale at four in the third period, ultimately forcing 20 additional minutes of sudden-death hockey.
Neither side struck gold in the overtime period, leaving the fate of the two rivals to a pressure-packed shootout—one that saw the Stars and Stripes convert on only one of five tries. But somehow, some way, one goal proved be enough, as Fox and the Americans emerged victorious on enemy soil.
“It’s something I’ll remember forever,” Fox said. “Being able to do that with such close friends in that atmosphere and that stage—it was something I’ll remember forever.”
“It was obviously just such a stressful and enjoyable time being there in that atmosphere,” he added. “It’s one of the biggest stages for hockey, so I was just so happy that we won.”
The United States ran the table on its way to gold, finishing the preliminary group stage with a perfect 4-0-0 record before squeezing by Switzerland, Russia, and Canada in the knockout rounds. And with Fox appearing in all seven games, members of the Harvard team were certainly tuning in.
“We’re all watching, we’re all pulling for him,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 while the tournament was still ongoing. “It’s such a great tournament and a great stage. I think he deserves the opportunity. He’s earned it.”
Through his first 18 collegiate games, Fox has logged two goals and 20 assists for the Crimson, making him the national leader in points per game among defenseman. He also runs the point on Harvard’s power play, which ranks first in the country in efficiency.
Fox now becomes the third Harvard skater in the last five years to play at World Juniors. Just last year, sophomore Ryan Donato played on the U.S. team that won bronze in Finland, while Jimmy Vesey ’16 won gold with Team USA back in 2013.
The freshman’s presence in Canada did mean that the Crimson had to do without him for its contest against Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on Dec. 30. But the tournament was far less kind to Harvard’s Beanpot neighbors. Nine of the 24 players on Team USA’s championship roster hailed from either Boston University (six) or Boston College (three). Among them was Eagles goaltender Joe Woll, who originally committed to Harvard in 2014 before changing course for Chestnut Hill.
Fox too wound up heading for Chestnut Hill rather recently, just not by his own accord. All 10 members of Team USA’s Massachusetts contingent traveled home on the same bus from Canada the day after winning gold, but Fox mistakenly wound up being the last skater to reach his destination.
The only problem? Harvard had a game to play at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center at 7 p.m., against defending ECAC champion Quinnipiac no less. And the clock wasn’t doing Fox any favors.
“From what I heard, they actually drove through Harvard,” Fox said. “But we weren’t really paying attention and then ended up at BU, then went to BC, and then finally came back here.”
If Fox didn’t make it back in time, no one outside the Crimson locker room would have thought twice. Fox had just played three games in four nights, two of which required overtime, and Coach Donato had been saying all week that the defenseman’s status was up in the air.
Later, Donato revealed that he had given Fox the option to take the weekend off. But the freshman planned on suiting up all along. Only an hour remained until puck drop when the freshman “cruised” his way into the Bright, according to Donato, but he was immediately inserted into the lineup as if nothing had ever happened.
“I was able to play, so that’s all that matters,” Fox said with a smile.
Despite playing in his third and fourth games in as many nights, Fox immediately picked up right where he left off, notching three more points over the weekend on tired legs and proving to Quinnipiac and Princeton that there just might not be a way of stopping the Fox.
Yet, considering the Crimson and Tigers met only two nights after Team USA’s championship-clincher, you couldn’t have faulted Princeton coach Ron Fogarty for having hope.
“I wish Fox had too many beers two nights ago so he couldn’t play,” Fogarty said. “He’s a really good hockey player.”

It's the last day to register for classes, but you'll invariably end up dropping a class and having to pick up another one:
We’ve all been there: you know that you’re taking a concentration requirement, a gen ed, and some class to trick your parents into thinking that you’ll get a job after you graduate. But you still need a fourth class to take. After shopping what seems like every class Harvard offers, you still have no idea what to fill this fourth class with.  What are you going to do? Who are you going to ask?
I’m here to give you the do’s and dont’s of the last minute course search. Disclaimer: as a second semester senior, I mostly agreed to write this post to get 3.5 years of pent-up bitterness and bad suggestions off my chest, so bear with me. Let’s start with the dont’s to maintain #suspense:
Never, ever—under any circumstances—ask
Your advisor. Are you being serious right now? If you’re a freshman, your advisor is some rando from the Harvard Office for Inefficient Bureaucracy who probably didn’t go here. If you’re an upperclassman, your concentration advisor literally has a Ph.D and you haven’t even fulfilled your AIU requirement. That’s a great way to find yourself in a “low workload” class with 500 pages of reading and a response paper per week.
Pre-meds. I love pre-meds and they’ll definitely end up a) more successful than me and b) probably responsible for saving my life some day, but this is a huge NO for course recommendations, especially for humanities concentrators. “Oh you still need to fulfill SLS as a junior? Take LS1a. No, no, no, you’ll be fine without AP Biology under your belt.”
Literally any undergraduate at Harvard. Have you ever heard of the Cambridge Paradox? It’s an age old philosophical quandary that I made up while writing this post. Basically, every other Harvard College student is automatically smarter than the person wrestling with the paradox, but is also searching for easy courses. It follows (#logic) that you must assume that any course recommendation -- even for gems -- is probably harder than what you’re looking for. I know it’s weird, but you can go to this link for more information.
Ask with reservations
Juniors who have a consulting internship or seniors who have a job lined up. If you did your homework and followed the link above, you’ll have learned that once a Harvard College student receives a job offer, they cease to be a Harvard College student in actuality. But, be careful: though free from the Cambridge Paradox, they might just take hard courses and not do the work, then claim it was easy.
*Note: I did not say to trust seniors who have been accepted into graduate schools. These are nerds.
Trust
The Q Guide. That’s it. Want an easy class? Find one with a low workload score (let’s be real, Harvard, once you stopped reporting difficulty, students just started using workload as a substitute.) Want a good professor? Stick to ones with 4.3+ on the Q.
No, seriously, always trust the Q scores. I don’t know how it took me that long to figure this out, but it’s not too late for you. You still have time. Make this semester the Harvard you always dreamed about...but like, not when you were in high school and dreamed about a fun, challenging Harvard experience. Make this semester the Harvard you dreamed about in the three hours of sleep you got after studying for the midterm in that class your freshman year roommate said you should take.
