After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to higher education, Californians enjoy an impressive range of options, including access to public colleges and universities that offer high-quality academics with a low sticker price. Last week, the California Supreme Court voted to uphold a 2001 law that extended this privilege to all individuals who have attended high school in the state for three or more years, regardless of citizenship, much to the relief of undocumented students who are thus eligible to pay the lower in-state tuition rates. This policy is an appropriate one, given that California is many undocumented students’ home as much as it is that of their citizen peers.
Children whose parents bring them to the U.S. have committed no crime, and many have spent the majority of their lives living outside their countries of origin. It is fair to grant in-state tuition to individuals who are California residents in essence, even if not in legal terms. Students who have worked hard in American schools in the face of trying circumstances deserve the opportunity to receive an affordable higher education and become degree-holding members of their adopted nation.
The policy does not “reward” individuals for breaking the law, nor is it likely to especially encourage more individuals to enter the country illegally. Three years in California high schools may sound like a paltry requirement for the average U.S. citizen, but it may be a formidable one for the son or daughter of a family that occupies a precarious position in society. The barriers that illegal immigrants face—in crossing the border, finding work, finding housing, obtaining medical care, and more—are already very high.
Those students who gain entry into California public colleges and universities despite all the challenges they face as illegal immigrants should be rewarded for their hard work and tenacity. Such self-motivated and accomplished individuals will benefit greatly from the opportunity to pursue higher education, and the U.S. stands to benefit from their contributions in return.
Moreover, in-state tuition does not amount to a free ride. For California residents, a year at a University of California campus still amounts to an estimated $27,000, with the $10,000 student fee being only part of the total cost. For undocumented students, who are not eligible to receive federal financial aid, higher education will still be a sizeable financial burden, even with the reduced in-state rate. Rather than being the recipients of special favors, they are merely being treated as any state resident would be treated—their access is not immediate, but merely improved.
The California in-state tuition exemption focuses attention not on how undocumented students got here, but what they can do now that they are in the country. It would be unjust to jeopardize the futures of children as punishment for the past actions of their parents. Whether or not they wished it, undocumented children in California effectively have become American, and they deserve a shot at the American dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I came close to applying early action to Yale instead of Harvard. Why, I figured, would I want to attend a school known for its dour student body, just to be able to drop the H-bomb on my resume? But then I visited Yale. Something didn’t seem right. I had heard that Yale students were cheerful, but I wasn’t expecting them to actually jump for joy while leading visitors through campus. Every Yalie smiled. Always. The people there, I sensed, were far too happy to be normal.  
Yale’s latest admissions video—titled “That’s Why I Chose Yale”—vindicated this intuition. And after watching the clip’s hilarious dismemberment by the “On Harvard Time” crew last week, I could no longer imagine myself wearing anything other than crimson. Aside from the tasteless line about Yale’s murder tragedy (which has since been removed), the OHT spoof beautifully illustrates why I made the right college decision.  
 
The Yale Dean of Admissions asserted that the new Yale admissions video effectively captures the spirit of the university. And the video is definitely spirited. Yalies, it seems, study less and frolic more. Birds chirp in the background as the Bulldogs’ colorful cast of characters prance in idyllic sun-drenched fields and sing songs about life’s beauty. Yale, in short, comes off as a real-life version of a Walt Disney film.
Unfortunately, that film is “High School Musical.”
Featuring everyone’s favorite flamboyant, pocket-sized vocalist, Sam Tsui, Yale ’11, “That’s Why I Chose Yale” is replete with over-the-top performances, creepy falsettos, and lyrics so cloying (“of course you’ll get a first-rate education/but also thrive on classmates’ conversation!”) that they cause cavities. The filmmakers contend, of course, that it was always their intention to create a campy, “accessible and pop-friendly” film to showcase Yale’s playful side. But it takes tact and wit to do camp right. And because the film so conspicuously lacks both, it implicates Old Eli as a bastion of overly eager students, blissfully unaware of the embarrassment they instill in their onlookers.
 
Harvard’s video, however, is everything that Yale’s isn’t. Starring the always-hilarious Ryan P. Halprin ’12, “Why Did I Choose Yale” keenly ridicules the aura of obliviousness that surrounds every student in the Yale video. Bright-eyed Yalies who can’t help but burst into song in class get shouted down by their professors. Characters croon in perfect harmony about how excited they are to have pool tables in their lounges just like every other school. Exaggerated facial expressions in Yale’s video get taken to their outrageous extremes in Harvard’s.
 
Seeing this video replicated the catharsis I felt when I first visited Cambridge. While a fanatical energy pulsed through every single Yalie, Harvardians were surprisingly and refreshingly down-to-Earth. Far from dour, Harvard students have pride in their institution but have no desire to express that pride by waving their arms around excitedly. Indeed, Harvard’s charm lies in the fact that it is so self-assured in its own worth that it sees no need to sell itself by creating loud and garish videos, and such displays rightfully turn off its students. As a result, Harvard resonates not saccharine sweetness but effortless class—a sublime beauty about as ostentatious as a walk around the Charles at sunset.
So it may be true that Yalies are statistically happier. And if you seek a college that its admissions office believes is best represented by a group of people pretending to star in a painfully unfunny version of “Glee,” then by all means transfer. But personally, I prefer a student body that’s self-aware, self-confident, and knows how to call it as it sees it.

As The Crimson reported on Friday, Harvard College is conducting a review of its abandonment of early admissions. While the admissions department is to be commended for thoughtfully evaluating its own policies, I wish it would conduct a more comprehensive review of Harvard’s admissions process. Indeed, I wish it would consider abandoning the admissions process altogether in favor of a randomized lottery.
The best way to do this would be in conjunction with other universities. Chad Adelman of the think tank Education Sector has proposed adopting the system used to match medical residents to hospitals. High school seniors would apply to a single admissions body and list their school preferences in order. Schools would set a minimum SAT score and high school GPA so that they do not admit students who truly cannot handle the work, but, otherwise, schools are randomly matched with students who list them as a preference.
Harvard probably has enough sway to launch such a system, but barring that it should set its own minimum threshold and then randomly cull from that vast majority of applicants who meet it. William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, Harvard’s long-time dean of admissions and financial aid, has said that 80 to 90 percent of Harvard applicants are qualified to be here. Harvard should identify that 80 to 90 percent, and then randomly accept 1600-1700 of them.
Some will no doubt object that this will undermine the “excellence” of Harvard’s student body. It will, and that’s exactly the point. For one thing, “excellence” in the Harvard admissions process—and at Harvard—has a lot less to do with virtuous character traits than with an ability to game the system. By placing a premium on students who go above and beyond in extracurricular realms, Harvard has attracted a number of truly incredible people but has also encouraged a high school arms race wherein kids cram their schedules with activities in an attempt to attract admissions officers.
By selecting for this kind of behavior, the admissions process doesn’t encourage real excellence, but, to use the novelist Walter Kirn’s term from his hilarious book and essay “Lost in the Meritocracy,” “aptitude for showing aptitude.” This may well be of use in students’ careers after college, but it is orthogonal if not antithetical to the goals of a liberal arts education.
But let us accept for a second that the system is not wholly corrupted and that there is a connection between “excellence” in the admissions context and real excellence or that such a connection can at least be achieved within a traditional admissions process. Even granting all that, why should the richest university in the world be devoting its resources to educating students who are already “excellent?”
By virtue of being the kind of students Harvard admits, people who go here already have a huge leg-up in life. A student admitted because of her preternatural brilliance would have been rewarded for that anyway. So, too, for a student with an extraordinary work ethic or an exceptional talent for the arts. Given that these students have so much going for them already, why should Harvard devote its resources to helping them even more?
There is some question as to whether Harvard helps the kinds of students it admits or whether it simply admits the kinds of students who tend to succeed anyway. The researchers Alan Krueger and Stacy Berg Dale have found that lifetime earnings for elite college graduates are significantly higher than for non-elite graduates. However, when one compares students at elite colleges to ones who were admitted but did not attend, the effect disappears.
Obviously, there is more to a successful life than making money, but the broader point remains. Harvard could probably do more good for students who are not already gifted than for those who are. Given that, why is the system biased toward students who benefit less?
There is a deeper moral question here as well. Harvard’s current admissions policies serve to entrench a caste system that grants advantages to the “talented” due to factors beyond their control. No one chooses to be naturally brilliant or to have parents who invest heavily in their pre-K-12 education. Nevertheless, one’s success in life seems contingent on these arbitrary factors, due in part to the existence of institutions like Harvard that reward such unchosen “talent.”
Harvard needs to think seriously as a community about whether we are comfortable entrenching inequalities resulting from pure luck. As the philosopher Thomas Nagel once famously noted, “When racial and sexual injustice have been reduced, we shall still be left with the great injustice of the smart and the dumb.” If we want to correct this injustice just as we struggle to correct racial and sexual injustices, then lottery-based admissions is a good place to start.

When I was exploring the subject of academia and its connection to autonomy or complacency, I came to the realization that both aspects are actually outcomes of exercising academic freedom, and by extension democracy. Academic freedom, like democracy, is itself evolving to accommodate those human aspirations for a more ideal state of being and an elevated state of consciousness, or as the well-known philosopher Oscar Wilde puts it "know thyself" was written over the portal of the antique world. Over the portal of the new world, "be thyself" shall be written.” Accordingly, the true purpose of political correctness, which is increasingly becoming an integral part of academia, should not be reversing any gains pertaining to freedom of thought and expression but rather to pursue and promote truth over all other considerations. The following quote by Albert Einstein accurately explains this central aspect of academia even further “By academic freedom I understand the right to search for truth and to publish and teach what one holds to be true. This right implies also a duty: one must not conceal any part of what one has recognized to be true.” Having said that, what I am about to address is an issue that constitutes an integral aspect of the benefits and pitfalls of academic freedom, particularly in the areas of the humanities. This issue pertains to autonomy versus complacency, in acquiring and disseminating knowledge.
Furthermore, the issue pertains to those professors who favor glossing over facts or downplaying certain unpopular truths for the sake of maintaining harmony in their classrooms and among their students. They, by adopting such an approach, subscribe to the philosophy of imparting a customized version of truth by basically telling their audience what they expect to hear and nothing more. This group of academics includes those who prefer to impart an enhanced and at times idealized and polished version of events, particularly of social, theological, or historical significance, in order to intentionally avoid unwelcomed discussions or debates. This kind of approach can cause the lecturer to tiptoe around hotly debated issues and therefore do more harm than good to the highly valued academic freedom. Even though it is commendable to pay heed to the sensitivities of others and their cultural, religious, ethnic, and racial particularities it should not be at the expense of true knowledge and true understanding. In order for a teacher to avoid the pitfalls of such a sheltered teaching style, they need to be diplomatic in their approach, but in a way that remind their listeners that pleasant and unpleasant truths are part of life and therefore should be perceived as such. Employing an entirely reserved approach can lead to a tendency on the part of certain professors to forsake the dignity associated with academic honesty and in turn surrender the momentum to their audience, causing the discussion to bypass the benefit of critical thinking and consequently descend into the realm of disinformation and half-truths. Moreover this type of approach can inadvertently turn educators into apologists, rather than advocates for the truth. Being diplomatic when discussing matters of sensitive nature is recommended but not to the point of sacrificing beneficial and healthy intellectual inquiries.
The establishment of a genuine and trustworthy relationship between instructors and students can no longer be looked at as merely an arrangement where someone with superior knowledge imparts that knowledge to a partly or mostly unengaged audience. Educators and students should rather establish a relationship of equals who have a mutual interest in advancing knowledge, regardless of whether one is on the giving or the receiving end of that knowledge. In other words, both instructors and students have a stake in an honest exchange of ideas and information. To put this simply, the more one teaches, the more one comes to the realization that education is fundamentally mutual. When students are given the opportunity to be engaged, the ensuing exchange becomes an outlet of intellectual energy that truly injects vitality into the issues being explored. Contrary to some educators’ views, today’s college students possess intelligence that is unique to their generation, which can be brought to the surface given the right approach and the existence of an atmosphere conducive to a more pluralistic education.

Harvard Law School professors discussed the challenges of teaching rape law in a panel yesterday, emphasizing that students’ sensitive and personal experiences should be omitted in discussions of the law.
In a talk organized by the Women’s Law Association, Alan M. Dershowitz, Janet Halley, and Carol S. Steiker ’82 spoke on how concepts of gender, race, and feminism influenced the way rape law had been approached both in classroom and courtroom settings over the past decades.
During yesterday’s discussion, the panelists noted similarities in how divorce, homicide and rape are approached in law school classes because personal experiences often influence student opinions.
The talk was a follow-up to an event held last month looking at students’ perspectives on discussions of rape in the classroom, said Joelle A. Milov, a WLA member who helped coordinate the event.
But both Halley and Steiker emphasized that personal stories about rape hinder discussion.
Halley said while “personal experiences absolutely inform people’s perspectives,” references to personal histories often hinder productive legal discussion.
Halley recalled a particular class during which a law student burst into tears after telling students about her experience as a rape victim. Her classmates did not know how to react and fell silent.
Halley added she preferred to have students play the roles of prosecutors and attorneys, rather than draw on personal experiences.
“It’s not a therapy session, it’s a law school class,” she said.
Law School student Emily A. Wales said she saw this approach of limiting talk of personal experiences in one of her classes, and this led to productive discussions. Students inevitably brought up personal experiences, Wales said, but in her experience the professor did well in refocusing the discussion back to the law.

Harvard scientists have discovered a new and potentially safer cell-reprogramming pathway that could bypass the controversial ethical issues generated by embryonic stem cell research.
Harvard Medical School professor Damian D. Medici developed a new method for reprogramming mature endothelial cells—which line the interior of blood vessels—into adult stem cells that can then be stimulated to become a variety of different mature cell types.
Medici’s study, published online earlier this week in the journal Nature Medicine, found a mutated gene that causes a disease known as Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva induced endothelial cells to become cells very similar to adult mesenchymal stem cells, which have the ability to differentiate into bone, fat, and cartilage cells.
FOP is an extremely rare genetic disease in which the patient’s soft tissue gradually hardens into cartilage and bone.
In addition, Medici said the new discovery is “a much safer alternative than induced pluripotent stem cells,” which also come from reprogrammed mature cells but can lead to cancer in patients.
When researching FOP, Medici and his colleagues found the mutated cells contained biomarkers for endothelial cells, perhaps indicating that FOP cells had an endothelial origin.
When Medici introduced FOP into normal endothelial cells, he found the cells had transformed into what was very close to adult stem cells.
Medici and his colleagues also found two growth factors, TGF-beta2 and BMP4, that mimicked the effects of the FOP gene and led to the transformation of mature cells into adult stem cells.
According to Medici, future studies will focus on how to treat FOP patients, and searching to find out whether the reprogramming mechanism found in FOP might be present in other diseases as well.

Using an iPhone application called Track Your Happiness, Harvard psychologists found in a recent study that daydreaming is associated with lower levels of happiness.
The study, published in the most recent issue of Science magazine, periodically polled more than 2000 adults who reported what they were doing, whether their minds were wandering, and how happy they were on a scale of 1 to 100.
The study found at any given time, almost half of the test subjects were thinking about something other than the situation at hand. In any given situation, subjects were likely to be “mind-wandering” at least 30 percent of the time, except during sex, during which their minds wandered only 10 percent of the time.
The paper was co-authored by Harvard doctoral student Matthew A. Killingsworth and Psychology Professor Daniel T. Gilbert, who doubted whether the unique evolutionary trait of “mind wandering” in humans has any significant emotional advantage.
“Even during unpleasant activities, when it would seem beneficial to be day-dreaming, we found that mind-wandering doesn’t lead to higher happiness,” Killingsworth said, pointing to commuting as an example.
The psychologists performed a time-lag test to assess whether it was unhappiness that prompted people to daydream, or vice versa.
The results showed subjects who were mind-wandering were more likely to be unhappy 15 minutes later. In contrast, subjects who were unhappy were no more likely to be mind-wandering after the same 15 minutes.
Perhaps most surprising of all, the content of one’s daydream seems to have little effect on level of happiness. Those whose thoughts wandered to more pleasant topics had only slightly higher happiness levels than those wandering to unpleasant or neutral topics, but they still had lower happiness levels than those focused on the present.
“The ability to think about what is not happening is a cognitive achievement that comes at an emotional cost,” the authors concluded in their paper.

Thomas L. Monahan ’88, chief executive of the Corporate Executive Board, spoke on developing networks and building successful professional and personal relationships in an event sponsored by the Leadership Institute at Harvard College last night.
The discussion, titled “Using Leadership Networks,” was moderated by Harvard Business School student and LIHC Board of Advisors member Larissa J. West.
During the discussion, Monahan emphasized the purpose of a network is not only to find others who can help aid one’s career advancement, but also to connect a group of people who will be personally invested in one’s overall development and progress.
The relationships within a network should not just be one-sided, Monahan added, saying the best way to establish a positive rapport with an individual in a network is to reciprocate interests.
“The worst time to meet someone new for the first time is when you need something from them,” Monahan said. “The people in your network need to trust you, need to have a vested interest in you.”
Monahan also focused on the idea that a good network never arises from the efforts of one person.
Derek Van Bever, who works with Monahan as chief research officer at the Corporate Executive Board, chimed into last night’s discussion to emphasize the power of group work.
“The main purpose of your network is to ensure that you are not alone,” Van Bever said. “There will be people wrestling with the same problems as you, but you will also have peers with solutions to these issues.”
“A good network must have the perfect give-get ratio,” Monahan said at the close of last night’s event. “You must develop the personal principles of trust and balance with these people. If you form these bonds with your network, they will always be behind you, working towards your success.”
Karen L. Ding ’12, chairperson of the Leadership Development Initiative and one of the event’s organizers, praised Monahan and the Corporate Executive Board’s development of the networking process, highlighting its relevance to Harvard students.
“Here at Harvard especially, we feel that leaders of student organizations can really be one another’s best teachers, in terms of sharing best practices, collaboration,” Ding said. “What Monahan and the Corporate Executive Board have done is really perfect this art of networking and mutual support, and that’s a capability that is so relevant to Harvard students.”

Sociology professor Robert J. Sampson was awarded the 2011 Stockholm Prize for Criminology last week for his research on criminals’ ability to reform their behaviors to become law abiding citizens.
Spanning 20 years, Sampson’s work demonstrated criminals can become lawful citizens after certain life-changing events, such as marriage and military service.
The research—completed with John H. Laub, director of the National Institute of Justice—represented a shift in the fields of sociology and criminology, as it was previously believed an individual’s tendency to become a criminal depended on childhood events.
“We found that childhood factors are predictive of adult outcomes but are in no way determinative,” Sampson said. “Our research showed that there are important turning points in which the trajectories of people’s lives can be altered or changed.”
Using old interviews of past criminals, originally performed by former Harvard Law School Professor Sheldon Glueck and his wife Eleanor T. Glueck, Sampson and Laub tracked the life courses of 500 male offenders and found their behavior often changed after such key moments.
Sampson and Laub have been working on the research since 1986 and met at graduate school at SUNY Albany.
Glen Elder, a sociology and psychology professor at University of North Carolina and a personal friend to both, said Sampson and Laub’s work transformed the discipline.
“I think of Sampson as the author of a school of thought in criminology,” Elder said. “He formed a theoretical tradition, a way of theorizing about criminology and crime.”
Elder added the nature of the work merited the commendation.
“I think the award was overdue,” Elder added. “One can’t ask for a greater award, and I think they deserve the Stockholm prize.”
But Sampson said he was not expecting the accolade.
“Winning the award caught me off guard, but it was a pleasant surprise,” Sampson said. “It’s gratifying to see that our research has had an impact on the study of crime around the world.”
The research mainly appears in two books that the pair coauthored entitled, Crime in the Making: Pathways and Turning Points Through Life and Shared Beginnings, Divergent Lives: Delinquent Boys to Age 70.
Sampson grew up in Utica, N.Y., a small town that was hard hit by industrial closures, according to an article published by the National Academy of Sciences.
The article added that Sampson first became interested in social patterns as a young child when he would flip through National Geographic magazine.

Hoping to house the Queer Resource Center in a more visible place than its Thayer basement location, LGBT students, allies, and other Harvard affiliates crammed into roughly 380 square foot area outlined on the Science Center lawn to demonstrate that the only LGBT-specific space on campus cannot contain the students it aims to serve.
“One-two-three-four the other colleges all have more! Five-six-seven-eight we’re standing here to change our fate”—cheered the crowd, who danced and sang along to blasting music, many of them skipping class to show their desire for University-sanctioned and -funded LGBT resources.
“There’s some sentiment that there’s already a center and the campus is LGBT-friendly, but we lag significantly behind our peer institutions,” said Harvard Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11, who also sits on the BGLTQ Working Group convened by the College to assess LGBT resources and needs. He noted Harvard is the only Ivy League school that lacks a university-funded resource center or staff person. The guide to LGBT-friendly colleges by the Advocate—a prominent LGBT magazine—does not even include Harvard, he added.
Samuel J. Bakkila ’11-’12, who drew the eye of tourists and Science Center-goers with chants through a loudspeaker, said that he felt this lack acutely as a freshman.
“I know that more resources won’t solve everything, but I think it’s fair for us to expect our college to match the resources provided by its peer institutions,” he said. “I want future freshmen to have more resources accessible to them when they need that kind of support.”
Elizabeth C. Elrod ’11, co-chair of Girlspot—a campus group for queer and questioning women—wielding a sign emblazoned with the words “Down there it’s THIS big,” described Harvard’s lack of resources for its LGBT students as “embarrassing.”
“My common room is at least one and a half times bigger than the space,” said the Eliot resident. “Having meetings in the QRC is like going back into the closet.”
Yesterday’s demonstration, she said, served to unite LGBT students and allies through the attempt to raise visibility.
Bobbing to the music and waving to friends as they joined the crowd, QSA Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12 agreed the demonstration helped bring Harvard’s LGBT and allied community together.
“For a lot of the students here it’s their first time standing together in a show of solidarity,” she said, explaining that many participate in a behind-the-scenes task force whose aim is to support the BGLTQ Working Group, but that this was their first time standing together publicly to demand support for the LGBT community.
“This highlights the importance of not only having resources, but how resources build strength and community,” said Wang, who is also a member of the BGLTQ Working Group.
She encouraged students to voice their own concerns and experiences at the open forums being held in each House over the next few weeks, or fill out the forthcoming survey on LGBT resources at Harvard.
James R. Sares ’12 bounced between clusters of students in the crowd, encouraging them to dance.
“We have no boundaries in our community except for the confinements of the QRC,” Sares said.

CORRECTION: December 6, 2010
 
Due to an editing error, an earlier version of the Nov. 23 news article "Harvard Students Rally for Larger LGBT Space"  incorrectly stated that Harvard is the only Ivy-league institution that lacks  both a University-funded LGBT resource center and center coordinator,  and attributed this information to Marco Chan '11. In fact, Chan had said that Harvard is  the only Ivy-league institution lacking either a University-funded LGBT  resource center or center coordinator.

Peter and Bobby Farrelly—most famous for their comedy films including “Dumb and Dumber,” “There’s Something About Mary,” and “Me, Myself, and Irene”—joked about their childhoods, their beginnings in cinema, and their comedic inspirations at a Kirkland event last night.
The pair also presented a sneak peek of the new collaborative film “Movie 43,” for which Peter directed a vignette.
The Conversations with Kirkland series, which featured news anchor Chris Matthews earlier this semester, brings diverse speakers to the House and provides students with an intimate setting for asking questions, according to house tutor and Harvard Law School student Ashwin Kaja ’07.
While the brothers’ style has been described by some critics as “gross-out comedy” for its plentiful use of slapstick and toilet humor, both brothers attribute their sense of humor to real experiences they had growing up in Rhode Island.
Bobby cited as an example the infamous “zipper scene” from the film “There’s Something About Mary,” calling it an incident that was “based off of some guy who had a zipper mishap at one of my sister’s parties.”
The comedy duo later moved to California to pursue film, although both brothers had graduated with degrees unrelated to film.
“We failed our way for about five or six years out of college,” Bobby joked, referring to the time after college during which he contemplated a career in insurance sales.
The brothers have also been praised in the past for their portrayal of characters with disabilities who are then able to overcome them.
The Special Olympics helped promote the Farrelly-produced 2005 comedy “The Ringer,” endorsing it as a film that facilitated better understanding of the Special Olympics and of disabled people.
“We grew up in a neighborhood with kids who were intellectually-challenged, and we all hung out a lot,” Peter said. “We were around people with disabilities a lot and it was a part of our world.”
According to Peter, working as a brother team has been an enriching experience.
“We grew up in the same bedroom so we pretty much agree on the same things 90 percent of the time,” Peter said. “But you do have that 10 percent of the time when you disagree.”
Tiffany T. Pham, a Harvard Business School student and a self-professed lifelong fan of Farrelly Brothers productions, said she was excited to see the duo in person.
“I really admire their work, and since the Business School doesn’t have the chance to bring in a lot of writers and directors onto campus, it’s great that this opportunity is available at the College,” Pham said.
“It’s great that we make a lot of people laugh,” Bobby said. “After all, laughter is such an incredible thing. It’s very therapeutic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A male Harvard undergraduate was the victim of an unarmed robbery near the corner of Walker Street and Shepard Street on Sunday evening at 8:23 p.m., according to university and local police.
The victim was approached by a male who told the victim, “give me what you got,” according to an entry in the Cambridge police log. The suspect left the scene after the victim gave him $17.
The police log entry identified the victim as a “Cambridge resident,” and Harvard University Police Department spokesman Steve G. Catalano confirmed the victim was a Harvard undergraduate.
Sunday’s incident follows a recent string of robberies or attempted robberies near Harvard’s campus since Oct. 30. This is the second robbery located near the Quad since.
On Nov. 2, two black males robbed a non-Harvard affiliate of his laptop, cell phone, and wallet on Shepard Street near Walker Street, also next to the Quad, according to an entry in the police log.
On the morning of Nov. 3, officers arrested a suspect connected to series of armed robberies in the Harvard and MIT areas. The suspect was also thought to be involved in the Nov. 2 robbery.
The Cambridge Police Department is still searching for the second suspect, according to spokesman Daniel M. Riviello.
On Nov. 11, a man unaffiliated with Harvard was the victim of an armed robbery just outside of Thayer Hall in the Yard.
“We believe that the most recent incident on [Sunday]...is not related to any other incidents that have occurred in the city,” Riviello wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
“Cambridge Police are still actively investigating this incident and are sharing information with Harvard University Police as we always do in hopes of identifying and apprehending a suspect as we have in many of the other incidents that have occurred in the Harvard area recently,” Riviello wrote in the e-mail.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of growing controversy and public health concerns, Massachusetts last week became the fifth state in the U.S. to ban the sale of the much-publicized drink Four Loko.
Yet the Massachusetts ban has prompted criticism for targeting all caffeinated alcoholic beverages—not just Four Loko.
New Century Brewing Company founder Rhonda Kallman said her company produces a caffeinated alcoholic beverage called Moonshot, which falls under the new state ban despite having a “different consumer base” than Four Loko.
“I make a 5 percent alcohol, all malt, craft-brewed pilsner beer,” Kallman said. “It’s a beer for beer lovers that want a caffeinated choice.”
Kallman said caffeinated alcoholic beverages are not uncommon, adding the FDA and individual states should reconsider the scope of the ban.
“What the FDA should do is regulate, not outright ban things,” Kallman said. “It can’t just be that four companies get singled out [in the Massachusetts ban].”
Harvard Square liquor store employees are also unsure of the effect of the ban on sales and whether it will curb binge drinking. An employee at a Harvard Square liquor store who requested to remain anonymous said the popularity of Four Loko and the persistent consumer demand might pose obstacles to an effective ban.
“Four Loko was huge. It was quite a hit,” the employee said. “But hey, safety first. Of course, [the companies] are just going to come up with something legal now.”
Additionally, the employee said he noticed a spike in Four Loko sales within the past few weeks as customers “stocked up” in anticipation of the impending ban from store shelves. The hype surrounding Four Loko—especially on college campuses—will likely encourage beverage manufacturers to find new formulas within the new FDA guidelines, the employee said.
One such manufacturer is United Brands, a San Diego-based company that produces the alcoholic energy drink Joose. In a statement issued Monday, United Brands CEO Michael Michail said that his company will respond to the public controversy which prompted the ban by “innovating” to adhere to new legal standards.
“Unlike other manufacturers, United Brands does not engage in illegal marketing such as giving away free product and maintains a Responsible Drinking Policy on its website,” the statement reads.
In the end, Kallman said she fears the ban is “reactionary” and fails to effectively target the dangers it seeks to eliminate.
“Let’s face it, college kids have been drinking illegally for decades,” she said. “If it’s not Joose or Four Loko that they’re buying, it will be something else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Boston club shut down a party for black Harvard and Yale graduate students and alumni Saturday night after management said the event attracted “local gang bangers” and potentially “the wrong crowd.”
Michael Beal ’06, a second-year student at Harvard Business School and an organizer of the event, expressed frustration with Cure Lounge management’s decision in an e-mail sent to attendees apologizing and promising reimbursement.
“Regardless of our crowd representing the pinnacle of academic achievement as Harvard and Yale College alumni, Law, Medical, Business and PhD students, we were perceived as a threat because of our skin color,” Beal wrote.
According to the e-mail, the club bouncers reported seeing “local gang-bangers” in the crowd of black students. The club attempted to only allow access to students with Harvard and Yale student IDs, but the organizers insisted since alumni made up a bulk of the attendees, the bouncers should adhere to the guest list. At 10:45 p.m., the management decided to close the club to prevent what management called the “wrong crowd” from entering.
Natalia N. Pearson-Farrer, a second-year Harvard Law School student, said she arrived at the club at 10:30 p.m. to see a crowd of predominantly black Harvard and Yale students and alumni dressed in cocktail attire. By the time she got in, she said she was surprised to see the bouncers had let very few people in, and soon after, the club told patrons it was shutting down because of technical difficulties. After the truth was circulated, though, she said she felt frustrated and embarrassed.
Beal said a lengthy conversation with the club owner led him to believe he was not racist, and this only added to his “consternation around what this event says about race relations in our country.”
Harvard has a history of similar incidents. In 2007, campus police responded to calls from students concerned that a picnic organized and attended by black campus groups was a group of non-university affiliates. In 2009, Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr., professor and director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Studies, was arrested in front of his house after Cambridge police thought he was trying to break in.
Pearson-Farrer said black university students face similar occurrences on a smaller scale relatively often. She cited black male friends who were turned out of clubs and bars because of their dress.
“I’ve never dealt with [an incident] this blatant, though,” she said, referring to the incident at Cure on Saturday night.
“I came to law school thinking that it would give me the power to be an agent of social change in my community,” she added. “Now I feel more powerless.”
Cure management did not return requests for comment.

CORRECTION: November 24, 2010
An earlier version of the Nov. 23 news article "Club Shuts Down Party for Black Harvard and Yale Students" incorrectly reported that Harvard University Police Department mistook a 2007 picnic attended by black campus groups as a group of non-university affiliates. In fact, HUPD had responded to calls from students concerned that the picnic attendees were non-university affiliates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University has begun to focus more on partnerships with private industry to fund science research, as the federal budget is expected to remain flat or decline in the coming years.
Harvard received about 6 percent of its operating revenue from federal agency grants in 2010, of which a large majority went toward science. But with the federal government facing looming deficits and the Republicans now in control of the House of Representatives, the University must prepare for a potential decline in those funds, according to University Provost Steven E. Hyman.
“While we continue to advocate for government funding of science...taking a clear eyed look at the domestic discretionary budget, we have to accelerate our attempts to diversify funding sources for scientific endeavors,” Hyman said in an interview Monday. “It’s important that we develop effective models of industrial sponsorship.”
The University announced earlier this year that it will partner with Sanofi-Aventis, a multinational pharmaceutical company based in Paris, to sponsor scientific research. That agreement will serve as a potential model for Harvard as it seeks to expand funding from and collaborations with the private sector, Hyman said.
With an anticipated decline in federal funding, the University plans to seek more support for science research from private firms, relationships that are not new to the University but could potentially be expanded.
The University has, for example, a $20 million deal in place with the German chemical company BASF to support research in areas that include the applied sciences, engineering, and chemical and systems biology.
Under the terms of the agreement with Sanofi-Aventis, the firm will provide grants to fund projects proposed by Harvard researchers, and the firm has the right to review the results of the funded projects.
But academic collaborations with private firms also create the possibility that a company’s business interests will impinge on researchers’ academic freedom and lead to an emphasis on research that can be quickly monetized, Hyman acknowledged.
Any future agreement will be structured to preserve an emphasis on basic science and the type of open-ended, prolonged research conducted under normal funding models, Hyman said.
“It is important to emphasize that the research projects that are sponsored by industry are always initiated and led by our faculty—we don’t do contract research or research for hire—and we are always mindful of our paramount obligation to promote and preserve academic freedom, to disseminate new knowledge, which means the freedom to publish, and to ensure that our research is pursued without any outside direction or interference,” said Isaac T. Kohlberg, the University’s chief technology development officer, in a statement.
Kohlberg heads an office with a long history of licensing technologies developed at Harvard and arranging collaborations with the private sector.
While funding agreements with the private sector might help cover funding shortfalls from the federal government, Hyman said government support is imperative and cannot be replaced with private funding.
“As important as these new funding models may become, they cannot substitute for government support of basic research,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a crisp Sunday afternoon, near the foot of a statue in Cambridge Common, a minister stands at a makeshift podium before a group mostly made up of homeless Cantabrigians. Together, they share the Word of God and chat over a homemade meal.
This tradition has happened every Sunday for the past seven years as the bedrock service of the Outdoor Church, an initiative started by Harvard Divinity School graduate Jedediah E. Mannis in the summer of 2003.
Mannis, a practicing attorney whose pro bono work for the homeless made him reconsider his calling, has joined forces with other Divinity School affiliates and neighborhood churches to provide outdoor prayer services and meals to the local homeless population.
Each Sunday, the Outdoor Church offers one service at 9 a.m. in Porter Square and another at 1 p.m. in Cambridge Common—to which all are welcome, according to Emma R. Crossen, a Divinity School graduate who directs the Church. For three to four hours every Sunday afternoon and evening, the ministers distribute meals as part of their walking ministry through Harvard and Central Squares.
Crossen says the meal program is relatively inexpensive to run because some of the necessary materials like sandwiches and socks are donated by local churches and Divinity School students and faculty.
Because there were no weekend meal programs for the homeless in Cambridge, the Outdoor Church decided in the spring to add a Saturday meal service to its more elaborate Sunday equivalent.
Beginning last month, Divinity School students have contributed to developing the new program, bolstering the unique combination of public service and spiritual outreach.
WALKING THE WALK
According to Kerry A. Maloney, the director of Religious and Spiritual Life at the Divinity School, her office collaborates with student organizations to provide the meals.
A given student leader serves as the “point person” each month and coordinates with eight to ten other students to create about 100 bag lunches containing a juice box, snacks, and either a roast beef, egg salad, peanut butter and jelly, or ham and cheese sandwich, she says.
Other members of the Divinity School community are contributing by foregoing one meal each week and donating the proceeds to the meal service.
As for those who handle the meal service, after a little orientation about what to expect from Mannis, the student volunteers set off into either Harvard or Central Square and walk a set path to distribute food and fresh pairs of socks.
“The logic behind the trail is to follow the benches,” Mannis says. In the winter, ATM lobbies and fast food restaurants are included in the equation, he adds.
Danyel I.R. Currie, a Divinity School student who led the last meal service, admits that she experienced some sadness on her first shift as she listened to the stories of many of the homeless people she used to pass by in Harvard Square each day.
But her participation in the meal service has changed the dynamic of her interactions with these individuals to whom she used to throw her habitual cursory smile or offer a drive-by dollar in the cup. “You feel good that you can do something, but at the same time, you recognize the limits of what you can do,” she says.
A UNIQUE PURPOSE
The uncertainty of homeless life contributes to the large variance in church attendance.
Mannis, who published a book in 2009 about his experience called “Joseph Tuckerman and the Outdoor Church,” says that though the church serves the same number of people each Sunday, the attendees are not always the same people. Of the 100 to 120 people served each week, between 20 and 30 consistently attend church service, Mannis estimates.
The number of participants has been consistent in the past four to six years. According to Mannis, people move in and out of the system, some move away, some get off the streets, new people move in, and some die. He says that about a third of the people who participate in the Outdoor Church program have been attending since 2005.
Despite the substantial ebb and flow of their work, Crossen says that the Outdoor Church is a close-knit community. Church goers often visit their members in jails or hospitals. “Word gets around fast when things happen,” Crossen says.
Wade B. Weigle, a congregant since June, says he attends services every Sunday: “It is nice to hear the word, visit, and get help with toiletries,” he says after a recent Sunday service as he enjoys an egg salad sandwich, a personal favorite of his.
The Outdoor Church also offers members red wristbands with a phone number so that church leadership can be contacted in case of emergencies.
Crossen says that though food and services are central to the Outdoor Church, it is not a typical social service program, as it also brings prayer to an often neglected population. “It does something different,” Crossen says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having overcome every other obstacle in his way, Marco Iannuzzi seemed to have met his match in a broken clavicle. Instead, the senior wide receiver made it back to the gridiron in time to make Crimson history and help his senior class secure a 4-0 record against Yale with Harvard’s 28-21 victory over the Bulldogs.
“He can do anything he sets his mind to,” junior quarterback Collier Winters said. “His character and never-say-die attitude allow him to bounce back.”
A week after becoming the first Crimson football player since 2006 to return a kickoff for a touchdown, Iannuzzi broke his clavicle in Harvard’s game against Lafayette.
“During the Lafayette game, I came down on it,” he recalled. “And when I came to the sideline I knew something was wrong with it. It’s happened before. During the Brown game [two years ago], the same thing happened.”
But while Iannuzzi knew immediately that his clavicle was injured, he thought he might be able to avoid surgery.
“The initial plan was [trying] to go for a simple bone graft...which wouldn’t have required surgery,” he said. “We thought that at nine in the morning the day after. By about noon, my doctor called me and said, ‘The fractures won’t heal properly. We’ll have to do surgery if you want it to repair right.’...I had a previous plate...We chiseled those and put them into the new fracture. It promotes faster healing for laying down bones. There were some risks to having it so close to the [center line]. The doctor really pulled through a miracle.”
While his clavicle was healing, Iannuzzi worked to keep up his fitness and receiving ability.
“In week one, two, I was biking, doing cardio,” he said. “Week three, I was able to start running. Week four, I started catching. I ran full practice: everything minus hitting.”
His efforts did not go unnoticed by his teammates.
“Marco’s always been a wonderful leader,” said sophomore running back Treavor Scales. “He’s always helping coach the young returners. [He’s always helping] guide us along, keep us informed and on point. It was monumental to see him come back. As a young player coming up on this team, to see a senior work so hard to come back was phenomenal.”
But despite his improvement, Iannuzzi didn’t get cleared to play until two days before The Game.
“[The doctor] said, ‘As soon as you take your shot, it’s going to hurt,’” Iannuzzi said. “If I was willing to deal with that, he was going to give me clearance...It was just a matter of dealing with pain. I’ve never taken taken pain medication—I’ve just built up a tolerance for pain.”
Crimson coach Tim Murphy was still hesitant to employ the receiver in the first half.
But when Iannuzzi was let loose, he made one of the biggest plays of the game, a 46-yard reception on a flea-flicker play that set his team up for its first touchdown of the day.
“For him being out as many weeks as he was and being on the same page says a lot about him,” Winters said. “He made a great play. He’s definitely a big-time deep threat. He did a great job catching the ball.”
But Iannuzzi’s biggest play came on the opening drive in the second half.
“The second half came around, and we needed something,” he said. “During halftime, I made eye contact [with coach Murphy], and he knew what that meant.”
It meant an 84-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. The return made Iannuzzi the only Harvard player ever to score a touchdown on more than one kickoff return in a single season.
“Marco’s just an unbelievable athlete,” Scales said. “He’s unreal when it comes to kick returning. We rely on him to give us a jolt when we need it. He’s never failed us.”
For both his teammates and his friends, Iannuzzi’s best game of his career couldn’t have come at a better moment.
“I had 53 guests here from Canada that included a ton of my family and a ton of my friends,” Iannuzzi said.  “[For] a lot of them, the last time they had seen me play was back in high school when...you’re scoring four touchdowns. I was afraid of disappointing them. The college game is different: a good game might be one catch...there’s a lot to live up to.”
Iannuzzi responded to his family’s expectations by catalyzing the first game-tying touchdown and scoring the second, in the process becoming Harvard’s all-time leader in average yards per kickoff return for both a season (34.5 yards) and a career (26.5 yards).
“It meant a ton to me that I was able to make it exciting,” he added. “When I was walking to the sideline, I gave them a couple of points. I still remember the feeling I had: a sense of pride. All these people have put some confidence in me. I felt like I was repaying them by doing that.”

Men’s cross country captain Dan Chenoweth seemed primed to finally reach his pinnacle, but a slip-up in his last race left the senior short of his goal.
After posting a 42nd-place finish at the NCAA National Championships for the past two years, Chenoweth arrived yesterday at the race in Terre Haute, Ind., looking to build on his stellar third-place showing from NCAA Northeast Regionals on Nov. 13.
Unfortunately for the Crimson captain, it just wasn’t his day.
“It was a tough race for Dan,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “He ran a great race through 7,000 meters, but then he hit a wall he’s never hit before, and I’m in the process of trying to find out what exactly went wrong.”
Chenoweth completed the 10k course in 33:20.3, which left him in 238th place overall.
But although the captain did not match his success from previous years, he nonetheless capped his Harvard cross-country career as one of the most accomplished runners in school history.
The Lowell resident earned his third straight NCAA All-Region nod for the Northeast this season and enjoyed a second consecutive year in which he was the Crimson’s top runner in every event he competed in.
Chenoweth was also the overall winner in the past two Harvard-Yale meets and established himself as one of the Ivy League’s most dominant athletes with a second-place finish at the Heptagonal Championships three weeks ago.
“[Chenoweth] had a fantastic cross-country season,” Saretsky said. “It didn’t end as he was hoping it would, but that’s our sport.”
The senior still has a chance to make his mark on the track, though, as the winter and spring seasons lie ahead.
“Dan’s incredibly resilient, and he has unbelievable perseverance,” Saretsky said. “He just wants to get back out there for track.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On paper, Shay Warren is only a sophomore. But sometimes, the facts can lie.
In many ways, he’s the oldest guy on the men’s wrestling team, having endured more than many seniors. That’s because Warren took two years off to live in Mexico City while on a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
“Ever since a younger age, I had decided I wanted to serve a mission for the Church,” the Ogden, Utah native says. “It’s something that helped me out a lot in my life and brought me a lot of happiness, and I wanted other people to have the same opportunity.”
Even before he stepped foot on Harvard’s campus, Warren had made it clear to Harvard coach Jay Weiss that he would be taking two years off after his freshman season.
“Obviously, who am I [to stop him]?” Weiss asks. “And I was like, ‘Think about it. In two years, we’ll pretty much get another recruit with three years to go, which is huge.’”
So, after wrestling his rookie year at Harvard, Warren temporarily hung up his singlet and headed to Provo, Utah for a 10-week training session. Once he finished that, it was off to Mexico. But even the ever-faithful Warren had his doubts.
“It’s kind of a scary thing, leaving your family…for two years completely and not seeing them and not knowing anybody,” Warren admits. “But I knew it’d be okay.”
At the start, things were rough for the wrestler, especially since he did not know the language.
“You kind of feel lonely if you can’t communicate with anyone, and you’re in a different country eating new food, living in new places,” he adds. “But with time I got over that.”
Eventually, Warren came to love the capital. Perhaps more importantly, he began to love its people and see past the myth of rampant violence that pervades the common view of Mexico.
“I always felt safe,” Warren says. “I really saw a lot of good people, a lot of people who were willing to help and willing to lend a hand, which at first might have been a little surprising just because of all the things I had heard about Mexico City before going.”
The Leverett House resident’s schedule was packed, with up to 10 hours each day of missionary work. Warren, who was always joined by a companion in his efforts, would talk to anyone who the pair felt could benefit from hearing the Church’s message, be it people in the streets or individuals who had set up a meeting. And it was this work that Warren found most rewarding.
In one of his favorite tales from his two years in Mexico, Warren tells the story of a man named Edgar. Though Edgar had a solid job and a good family, he still was not satisfied with life. That’s where the wrestler stepped in.
“We started teaching him about Christ and how we need also a spiritual fulfillment…a spiritual side in a relationship with God,” Warren recalls.
The results were profound.
“You could see the happiness come into his life…he was just so much happier with his family, and his work, and all the things that he was doing,” Warren adds. “Those are the most rewarding experiences.”
The missionary work did not always go that smoothly. Some rejected the messages of the LDS church, even when, in Warren’s eyes, they knew they could benefit from the teaching.
“[Seeing people] not making changes in their life that would bring them a lot more happiness because of… fear of change,” Warren explains, frustrated, “was kind of hard.”
After nearly two years of intense work, it was time for the missionary to come home. And after feeling so concerned at the outset of his journey, he returned satisfied that he had learned as much from the citizens of Mexico City as he had taught them.
“Even if someone’s made a lot of mistakes, or if their life’s torn apart, they can change that and completely turn things around,” Warren notes.
The experience, to put it plainly, gave the wrestler a new outlook on life.
“Things are going to work out if I have the right perspective on life and know how important my family is, my friends, good relationships, [and] those types of things,” the sophomore says. “So it gave me a better perspective, I think, on life.”
After touching down in the U.S. in August of this year, it was quickly back to Cambridge. After a two-year delay, it was finally time to become a sophomore. What’s more, Warren would get a chance to rejoin the wrestling team.
“I missed wrestling while I was in Mexico City, so it was good to be back on the mat,” Warren says. “I’m really, really looking forward to the first competition.”
Despite being gone from the team for two years, the second-year grappler hardly missed a beat. He quickly began getting back into shape, training rigorously to regain the 15 pounds he had lost. And though Warren knew very few of the wrestlers on the squad, he became an integral component of the team almost instantly.
“He was welcomed back with open arms,” sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman says. “He’s really got great things to say and great things to add both on and off the mat.”
Importantly, Warren shores up a hole at the 133 lb. class that the Crimson has had trouble filling the past few years.
“It is going to make a big difference,” Weiss says of Warren’s return to the wrestling scene. “He makes the wrestlers around him better as well.”
Despite the anticipation surrounding Warren’s return, he has yet to compete in his first match, as the first two contests of the year have fallen on Sunday, the day of the Mormon Sabbath. While Warren had wrestled on Sundays before his mission, he refuses to do so after his two-year trip.
“That’s part of…what my mission changed in me,” Warren explains. “[It] made me see what was really important for me, and not wrestling on Sundays to me shows where my dedication is.”
“I know the thing that’s going to be the most important in my life is my faith, and I want to put that before anything else,” he adds.

Before the Crimson football team’s matchup with Penn on Nov. 13, Harvard coach Tim Murphy noted that Collin Zych and Alex Gedeon acted like the two captains of defense. Turns out Murphy’s analysis was spot on.
The coach announced at the team banquet tonight that Gedeon, a junior this year, was elected by his teammates to replace outgoing senior Zych as the official team captain. The third-year linebacker, who posted 49 tackles and tied for second on the team with two interceptions in addition to occasional punting duty in 2010, takes over as the 138th captain of Harvard football, an honor that Zych carried well enough to earn his own accolade this evening—the Robert F. Kennedy Award for desire and determination.
The Crimson handed out a number of other awards at its annual season-ending dinner, which was held at the Harvard Club of Boston. Senior Gino Gordon—whose 1,059 rushing yards this year marked the seventh-most in team history—took home the Frederick Greely Crocker Award for team MVP. Gordon, who sits at fourth all-time on the career rushing list with 2,643 yards and first all-time with 5.3 yards per carry, led the Ivy League in the latter category in 2010, ripping off 6.3 yards per rush. Gordon also found the endzone 10 times, bringing his career total to 25 touchdowns, and was the first tailback to rush for 1,000-plus yards since Clifton Dawson ’07.
Seniors rounded out the rest of the awards as well. Brent Osborne and Chuks Obi shared the Joseph E. Wolf Award as the team’s top interior linemen, receiver Mike Cook earned the Henry H. Lamar Award for dedication to the program, and Chris LeRoy’s enthusiasm, sportsmanship, and loyalty granted him the William Paine LaCroix Trophy.

Don't remember much from Saturday's tailgates? Don't worry, we've got you covered.
As part of our coverage of the 127th playing of The Game, we sent a correspondent out into the fields surrouding Harvard Stadium to gauge the enthusiasm of both Elis and Cantabs alike as they prepared for the Ivy League's most anticipated annual sporting event.

While many of us are eager to return home to family and friends, it’s important (and worthwhile) to check your room before leaving for the airport. An enormous amount of energy is wasted each year when students depart from their dorms with lights still turned on, windows open, and water running. Help Harvard save money and energy over Thanksgiving break by keeping the following energy-savers in mind before reaching for that doorknob!
Heating and Lighting
Turn off or turn down heating in the building (or, if you don’t control your heating, shoot your building manager an e-mail letting him know if your room will be vacant).
Shut, lock, and secure all windows tightly so the cold winter air, rain, and wind can’t creep in. Notify building managers if windows are improperly shutting or have cracks.
Pull all curtains shut to avoid heat loss.
Turn off all lamps, computer displays, nightlights, and overhead lights.
Unplug, Unplug, Unplug!
 Unplug all alarm clocks, TV’s, DVD players, hair dryers, printers, chargers, speakers, holiday lights, microwaves, refrigerators (if possible), and coffee makers. These all consume energy simply by being plugged in.
Water
Turn those shower and sink knobs tight. Contact your building manager if you face any leaky faucets.
Do your part in helping Harvard to minimize those wasted kilowatt-hours and carbon dioxide offsets. Have a great break!
