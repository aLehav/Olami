Everyone could use a little more headspace, right?
The extra space in your brain could be used to learn the lyrics to your new favorite song, memorize all the bones in the body for LS 2, or just allow for some more freethinking in your head. This might sound a lot easier said than done, but thanks to an iPhone app that teaches you how to meditate, having some wiggle room in your noggin could be right around the corner!
The app teaches guided meditation, which basically means you sit back and relax while a British voice named Andy walks you through everything. Don’t be scared if you’ve never tried meditation before! The sessions are only ten minutes long, a time commitment everyone can handle. So download the app, grab a friend, find a comfortable, calm location, and get some Zen in your life.
And if you somehow don’t have ten minutes to spare but still want a daily dose of peace, then look no further than the Harvard Meditation Phoneline. That’s right - there is an entire phone line Harvard owns that is dedicated to giving anyone who calls it a three or four minute guided meditation session. Call (617) 384-2256 for a good time on-the-go tranquility.
P.S. If you’re interested in other meditation opportunities at Harvard, the Harvard Meditation Club meets every Sunday in the Adams Upper Common Room at 2:30pm.
