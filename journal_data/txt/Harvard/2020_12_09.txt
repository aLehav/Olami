For decades, book lovers and tourists alike have flocked to the Strand Book Store in New York City’s Greenwich village to marvel at the 23 miles of rare, used, and new books that line the historic destination’s shelves or to secure a Strand-branded tote bag. It would be far from an exaggeration to say that the Strand is deeply rooted in the city’s expansive literary legend.
Like many bookstores, the Strand was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. With the loss of New York tourists, foot traffic, and hundreds of in-store events a year, the Strand’s proprietor, Nancy Bass Wyden, claimed that the store had lost 70 percent of its expected revenue relative to 2019 — a loss she claimed was unsustainable for the book business.
“I’m going to pull out all the stops to keep sharing our mutual love of the written word,” Bass Wyden wrote in an open letter to customers on Oct. 23. “For the first time in The Strand’s 93 year history, we need to mobilize our community to buy from us so we can keep our doors open until there is a vaccine.”
Immediately, loyal customers and other Strand-supporters were motivated by Bass Wyden’s plea to #SaveTheStrand. Long lines took over the previously empty storefront and the Strand’s website crashed as a result of heavy traffic. They received 25,000 orders and made $170,550 in sales the weekend following Bass Wyden’s post.
Despite all its appeals to the masses, however, the Strand is not the community-driven indie bookstore it pretends to be. The New York institution has long been at the center of controversy for its failure to commit to the ideals of hard work and resilience that Wyden cites as the store’s historic strengths. Back in 2014, this dissonance was brought to the fore with reports that the store was using its sprinklers to disperse unhoused people trying to sleep under the store’s awnings. Before that, in 2012, the store was the target of a worker-driven picket line over claims of union busting and unfair contracts from Bass Wyden and her father, then co-owner Fred Bass.
This year, mere weeks prior to applying for and receiving a PPP loan, Bass Wyden, a millionaire, fired the majority of the Strand’s 212 person staff — 170 of which were unionized — despite accepting the $1 million to $2 million loan on the condition that they keep their staff. In late June, the Strand rehired 33 of those workers, bringing the total staff to 57 before again firing 12 workers over email two weeks later. In a statement, the United Auto Workers Union, of which some Strand workers are a part, called the firings "an escalation of Bass Wyden’s long-standing pattern of wanton disregard for the physical, mental and financial well-being of her employees.”
Bass Wyden has since claimed that the firings were a result of the Strand’s drastically cut finances amid the pandemic — but that was the very point of securing a PPP loan. In the meantime, Bass Wyden has instead personally invested $160,000 to $400,000 in Amazon stock, the very corporation she has claimed has hurt the independent bookstore in the past. She made these purchases around the same time she laid off Strand employees.
There is no question about the Strand’s significance in New York’s literary history, but that doesn’t mean that the institution as it exists now — one that seems to value profit over workers and public image over community members — has to be rescued. We don’t need to cling to these historic vestiges of the past if they no longer serve us. We can do better.
Yes, the pandemic has hurt independent bookstores, but the Strand is already levied by a multi-millionaire owner and a massive platform provided by the store’s standing as a historic landmark. In all likelihood, the Strand isn’t going anywhere, and if it is, maybe it’s better that way.

At some point, optimism becomes unbearable. On the cusp of adulthood, people often shed their naïveté for hardened cynicism, a transition aimed at reducing the potential for disappointment and harm. American writer and comic artist Allie Brosh is acutely aware of this progression, and leverages its complexities to illuminating effect in her new book “Solutions and Other Problems.” A combination of cartoons, meditative prose, and confessional essays, Brosh’s latest text challenges the formal conventions of literary and visual storytelling while providing a fresh — if at-times affected — perspective on loneliness, existential anxiety, and the disorienting absurdity of life.
Similar to her celebrated comic autobiography “Hyperbole and a Half: Unfortunate Situations, Flawed Coping Mechanisms, Mayhem, and Other Things That Happened” (2013), Brosh’s newest text is organized around eclectic personal experiences punctuated by philosophical introspection. Accompanying Brosh’s narration are whimsical cartoons — whose artistic style is consistent with that found in her former books and her blog “Hyperbole and a Half” — that make her fast-paced, at times disjointed musings immediately accessible. Brosh’s stylized illustration of her speaker, which can best be described as a humanoid stick figure, lends the text an endearing eccentricity as well as a universality: The strange avatar makes the speaker anonymous — it could easily represent anyone, even readers themselves.
At first glance, it is easy to dismiss Brosh’s text as mundane and perhaps even juvenile. A sweeping look at her profound chapter titles, which include “Bucket,” “Bananas,” “Cat,” and “Poop Mystery,” corroborates this initial judgement. The subversion of this initial impression, however, illuminates one of Brosh’s greatest strengths as a thinker: her capacity to draw out revelatory insights from the exceedingly ordinary. Through imbuing her retrospective gaze with philosophical wisdom, everything — even the most unassuming experiences, including a childhood run-in with a neighbor and a hike up a mountain — assumes allegorical significance.
In her first chapter “Bucket,” for instance, Brosh recounts the humorously pathetic experience of getting stuck in a bucket as a three-year-old. The absurd childhood memory expands into a thoughtful meditation on how a lack of control can trigger intense psychological discomfort, even a sense of existential anxiety. In the short prose that accompanies her illustrations, she writes, “And suddenly, there I was — sideways, four limbs deep in a plastic car-wash bucket — only three years old, already doomed to spend my life scooting like the world’s saddest upside-down hermit crab.” She continues, “That’s the scary thing about decisions: you don’t know what they are when you’re making them.”
Brosh’s escapades, however, are not solely light-hearted. She frequently uses humor to portray her nuanced experiences with shame, confusion, and insecurity. In “Daydreams,” she details her assorted fantasies: Brosh as a Napoleon-esque figure riding into combat, a chessmaster poised for a monumental victory, a tamer of dragons. Her bizarre visions — ones that provide her with a semblance of authority and self-importance — are coupled with a confessional intimacy that speaks to her abyssal dread that nothing she amounts to will ever be enough: “I’m a tragic, greedy animal,” she concedes, “with too many dreams to feel satisfied by reality.” There is a piercing candor to Brosh’s admission of her continual impulse for bigger and better things. She continues, “I want to know what everything cool feels like. I want to ride dragons into battle. I want to be important. I want to know what it would be like if everyone believed in me.” In the span of sentences, Brosh swiftly transitions from dragons to the deeply human impulse to be valued, a shift that encapsulates her narrative and intellectual flexibility.
Ironically, “Daydreams” also exemplifies a key drawback of the text: Brosh’s tendency to draw out ideas for intellectual or comedic effect, so much so that their initial impact thins. The vulnerable tone toward the beginning of the chapter is diluted by the unnecessary hypotheticals entertained in the following pages. Brosh occasionally becomes hyper-aware of her text’s irreverent, idiosyncratic bent and, in an attempt to underscore these qualities, burdens the organic rhythm of the text. Her self-conscious efforts make her writing — which draws its power from careless spontaneity — cumbersome and contrived.
At times, Brosh aims to convey quirky existential wisdom to dubious effect. Her attempts at a coy intellectual irony simply result in confusion. A two-page chapter titled “Potato,” for example, literally features a conversation between the speaker and a potato. After the latter introduces itself, it commences to ask, “you wouldn’t happen to be suggesting that vengeance is an appropriate response to how unfair the universe is, would you?” After the speaker denies the claim, the sentient vegetable replies, “good. i’m glad we talked about this.” The abrupt chapter, which was likely intended as a fresh, tongue-in-cheek philosophical punch, reads more as a contrived attempt at profundity.
Despite the occasional forced humor and aimless philosophizing of her stories, Brosh’s literary vision is nonetheless admirable. In offbeat, endearing prose, she alternates between existential dread and an embrace of the absurdity of life. Through her nuanced engagement of these seeming opposites, Brosh emphasizes that even the most antithetical ideas — dread and wonder, devastation and joy — necessarily coexist.

Although a crucial and intricately-crafted work of Arabic literature, al-Harīrī’s “Maqāmāt” –– set in the medieval Middle East –– is lesser known to the non-Arab speaking world. This is, in part, because many English-speaking writers have difficulty translating the linguistic intricacy and genius al-Harīrī’s “Maqāmāt” articulates. “Impostures,” as constructed by Michael Cooperson, is a new take at translating this historically and culturally-significant masterpiece.
The narrator of al-Harīrī’s “Maqāmāt,” al-Ḥārith ibn Hammām, a well-intentioned and naive traveler repeatedly encounters a man by the name of Abū Zayd throughout each of the fifty tales. Abū Zayd is an “imposture” –– as the title of Cooperson’s interpretation suggests –– posing as a different and typically penniless individual in each tale. His eloquence and way with words often fools his audience, bringing him sustenance, admirers, and coinage. It is only al-Ḥārith who eventually recognizes this trickery, usually only after he himself is fooled. Abū Zayd disguises himself behind a variety of masquerades, sometimes pretending to be a holy man, blind beggar, or victim of homicide, in order to secure the (often monetary) support of his new-found followers. Al-Ḥārith rebukes Abū Zayd for his deceit, but still treats him as a close friend.
Abū Zayd has a facility of speech that many –– including Al-Ḥārith –– admire, justifying how Abū Zayd is able to continually woo his acquaintances before he suddenly deserts them. This gift resembles Al-Ḥarīrī”s own linguistic talent. His expert implementation of many different artistic techniques, such as palindromes and constrained writing (as explored in one particular imposture in which Abū Zayd must only use undotted-letters for every second word) is truly a feat to translate from its original Arabic.
Cooperson takes a unique approach to this language problem, employing a variety of literary styles across various periods of English literature. Interestingly, he also implements other non-conventional varieties of English such as Spanglish, Singlish (Singaporean English), and even 19th century swindler lingo. In some impostures, he draws on the difficulty in comprehending some dialects of English to convey the complexities of al-Ḥarīrī’s writings. Moreover, each stylistic interpretation that Cooperson provides –– which is distinct for each of the fifty impostures –– is intentionally picked with the purpose of portraying the defining features of each tale as it was originally designed in Arabic. Nonetheless, although Cooperson expertly designs and precisely executes these stylistic choices with an incredible display of linguistic and written control, there is almost too much infusion of other literary cultures and traditions in “Impostures.”
The use of such a diverse variety of literary styles takes away from the original translation of this work of art. Although it is impossible to exactly render the precise meaning that al-Ḥarīrī intended to communicate, particularly without using the specific literary devices as originally articulated in the Arabic language, by taking from different literary traditions not related to those of the original writing, Cooperson places “Impostures” in a completely different context, leaving some readers confused. For example, by composing Imposture 10 in the style of Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales,” the tale takes on a Middle English sentiment that was not intended in the original “Maqāmāt.”
Although this can be especially disorienting for readers less familiar with Arabic and English literature from these periods, not all of the original meaning is lost in Cooperson’s translation. He is skilled at portraying the general significance and sentiment that each tale means to manifest in a unique manner that leaves readers perplexed. It is not an easy task to interpret the intricate complexities of another language that derives from a completely different culture, religion, and custom. However, Cooperson does a more than adequate job of attempting to bridge that gap.

“How did we do this just by living / in the normal way,” Margaret Atwood asks in “Dearly,” her first poetry collection in over a decade. This is the question, and the tragedy, at the heart of the book. Catastrophe, loss, and terror — which take many forms, including climate change, death, and rape culture — are all inevitable. They are simultaneously bland and devastating.
Motifs of memory, nature, age, and language run throughout the collection. The poems are written in free verse, with no set rhyming scheme or form. “Dearly,” like Atwood’s 2007 poetry collection, “The Doors,” is divided into five parts. Each section is loosely held together by a theme: Part I, for instance, addresses age and mortality. Of the five sections, IV and V are the standouts: Part IV focuses on nature and mythology while addressing climate change; Part V returns to the themes of endings, mortality, and death that are threaded throughout the entire collection. Atwood’s best poems are filled with surprising imagery and metaphor that allow her to explore the nuances of her subject matter with depth and maturity. But more often than not, Atwood falters at the weightiness of her subject matter. Vague and generic imagery take the reader out of the world Atwood has built. It lacks the emotional poignancy that is indicative of her best work.
Mythology and folk tales are a strong thread throughout the collection. The best of these kinds of poems create a sense of inevitability, using parables to uncover universal and timeless human flaws. “Plasticene Suite,” one of the strongest poems in the entire collection, is a meditation on climate change. In it, Atwood reflects on van Goethe’s parable, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, where a young magician casts a spell that he cannot undo. “Go is easy, / Stop is the hard part,” she writes. It’s repurposed as a story of modern excess: “the magic machine grinds on and on / spewing out mountains of whatnot… / and this will not end well.” There is a continuity to our flaws, Atwood suggests. Though the consequences are immense, the causes are bland.
The strongest poems in the collection make use of similarly haunting images. As Atwood navigates the complex and unassailable territory of aging and death, she returns to unassuming imagery. “You crave the end of mazes,” she writes in “Flatline,” a poem about an aging friend. And in “Invisible Man,” she anticipates the death of a lover, who will become “the shape of an absence,” “a muscle memory, like hanging a hat / on a hook that’s not there any longer.” The gravity of these statements is not conveyed through melodrama, but rather through simplicity. Life is a child’s game; love is a habit — the triviality in these images rings true to the emotions she is trying to capture. Here, the insignificant is sadder than the significant.
But often Atwood’s imagery is vague at critical moments. In “Winter Vacations,” a poem about lost memories, she writes: “but something’s eroded them: / we can’t trace them back.” Change has occurred, but Atwood doesn’t seem to have the language to describe it. This is unusual for her — beyond these lines, the poem is filled with striking images: She describes youth as a “meadow where we began so eagerly / with the berry-filled cups” and aging as a “a trail of muffin crumbs / and wet towels and hotel soaps.” But the strength of these later images only serves to make the former seem more insufficient. In a poem driven by imagery, the omission of one is glaring.
More jarringly, Atwood completely changes the scope of her language. Her best images are detail-oriented and tactile — “muffin crumbs” — not ambitious and conceptual, like erosion. Poems can, of course, use juxtapositions like this to great effect. But here, it feels careless rather than intentional. The emotional crux of the poem is change itself, but the reader is offered no compelling language surrounding it. The poem’s energy is misspent: Though there are nuanced details and motifs to draw the reader in, there is no equally interesting project at the heart of the poem.
This type of misstep is common in the collection. “Souvenirs” meditates, as the title suggests, on souvenirs, which Atwood beautifully describes as “folkloric knitting, droll hardware, / wooden trolls. Shells, hunks of rock. They silt up our luggage.” But near the end of the poem, she simply concludes that souvenirs have “powers, / though I don’t know what they are.” Part of the problem here is stylistic. Atwood abandons one of her most impactful tools — imagery — to make this kind of linguistic turn. But the other part of the problem is inherent in its framing. Ambiguity can be used to pose questions to the reader, to prompt their imagination and their reasoning. Instead, Atwood allows her reader to be comfortable with imprecision. Rather than pushing the boundaries of the ineffable, she returns to easy and nebulous definitions that do not invite further curiosity or interpretation.
Atwood’s strongest poems are outstanding, filled with insight and wisdom that goes far beyond the confines of the page. But too often, the poems fall flat, missing the magic that brings Atwood’s best work to life.

Picking up a book about a family’s remote vacation that quickly transforms into isolation feels quite topical while living in quarantine. Rumaan Alam’s “Leave the World Behind” tells the story of a white family from New York traveling to Long Island for a brief vacation with their two teenage children. Basking in their much-needed respite from the rat race of the city, Amanda and Clay seek to revitalize their marriage and reconnect with their children, Rose and Archie. Their vacation is interrupted when the Black owners of their Airbnb rental, G. H. and Ruth, return from the city with a late-night knock at the door. They tell Amanda and Clay that there has been an unexplained blackout in the city, and they think it would be best to ride it out at the house with them.
Although this story with a plot full of suspense makes the reader consider the reality of a modern-day apocalypse, “Leave the World Behind” lacks compelling characters with believable interiorities, and is full of too many swings, missing potential areas for discussions of race and privilege that would make this book a compelling reflection on humanity.
“Leave the World Behind” is told in a conversational narration which makes for a good on-the-beach read but does far more telling than showing to paint a believable picture of this upper-middle-class family. Alam spends the first few chapters laying out who these characters are — Amanda, an account director; Clay, a professor; Archie, their teenage son; Rose, their naive daughter — but beyond the basic construction of a well-to-do family without much dysfunction, they are rather boring. While this most likely is the intent of the story — to create the average White family thrown into a world of suspense — it does little to keep the reader interested in the characters and their intentions.
Speaking of intentions, Alam desperately wants the world to know that Clay and Amanda want to have sex. While sex in novels can portray intimate ties between characters that allow partners to understand themselves through each other, the sex in “Leave the World Behind” is boring and, frankly, gratuitous. Both Amanda and Clay are obsessed with Clay’s penis, thinking about it constantly in a way that demonstrates little more to the reader than that this book was written by a man. It is a depiction of the carnal that does nothing more than assure this story won’t find its way on a YA shelf.
At times, Alam loses the attention of the reader with a laxity of control over the third-person narrator. “Leave the World Behind” mainly follows the point of view of Amanda, Clay, Archie, and Rose, in that order, but at times it switches to follow the interiority of some of the secondary characters. Although this may not seem like a horrible feature of the narrative style, part of the story’s suspense is the paranoia that the family, especially the parents, have towards some of these characters. When the narrator focuses on these secondary characters, the reader knows that they aren’t lying and the reader’s feeling of paranoia reverts to simply an understanding that the parents are paranoid — now, unjustly.
One interesting point of narration, however, directed towards Amanda and Clay’s interior thoughts is the focus on racial dynamics. Often, Amanda and Clay, through free indirect speech, acknowledge potentially racist thoughts, one of which is Amanda’s kneejerk reaction to assume that G. H. and Ruth are lying about owning the house because they are Black. Although this premise itself is not believable, as Amanda would have seen G. H.’s picture on in his Airbnb profile when making the reservation, it sets the story up for a thoughtful provocation of race and wealth. Alam, however, doesn’t build on these reflections past recognition of their existence.
While we shouldn’t box writers of color into an expectation of placing race at the center of all of their works, when race is brought up in this manner but is not considered beyond the surface level, it does a disservice to the development of the characters and the topic of race as a whole.
Its faults aside, “Leave the World Behind” does well in its plot-driven suspense. The short chapters make it easy for the reader to keep going for hours (and so does the relatively underdeveloped narration) that end with mystery after mystery. The twists and turns and unexplained events keep the reader coming back even when the characters and their thoughts drag behind.
“Leave the World Behind” is an intriguing read to fill your weekend of staying home and staying safe, but lacks the characters and narration to take this book to the next level. It strives for a level of depth with its brief contemplations of race and privilege but stops short of making compelling realizations about privilege that would be beneficial — especially during this year’s visible reckoning with the explicit and intricate manifestations of racism in America.

“To Sleep in a Sea of Stars,” the first adult book of YA genre powerhouse Christopher Paolini (author of the “Eragon” series), is a captivating tale of space exploration, human curiosity, and love in its many forms. This epic adventure follows xenobiologist Kira Navárez, who on a routine survey mission makes an alien discovery that leads to the loss of her team. Stranded in space, Kira teams up with a band of unlikely heroes to save the universe from interstellar war with her new alien technology. The novel follows her journey through the galaxies to find answers, battle enemies, and facilitate peace in the known (and unknown) universe.
One of the standout features of this novel is the detail and care that Paolini puts into the world of the novel. This is a futuristic sci-fi, which takes place some 200-plus years in the future, with highly advanced technology. Paolini expertly toes the line between accessibility and specificity. There are no questions left unanswered in regards to the technology and science in the novel, and Paolini even delves into the oft-ignored questions of fantasy and science fiction, such as how sickness and menstruation work among the stars. To aid the reader in gaining absolute clarity, Paolini even includes an appendix of all the jargon and unfamiliar terms used in the novel. Additionally, the chapters are broken up by maps of space to contextualize the vastness of the settings this novel explores.
The novel also explores the idea of human contact with alien species. “To Sleep in a Sea of Stars” approaches this common exploration with a unique perspective. Paolini raises questions about values, societies, and duty in order to extrapolate what makes humanity special. Paolini also does so in a way that satiates the curiosities of the audience. The protagonists make a total effort to understand the aliens, giving the reader interesting context about these unfamiliar creatures and providing a refreshing take on this pocket of the science fiction genre.
The sheer gravity and reach of this novel’s conflict is grounded by the story’s compelling characters. There is a dynamic ensemble cast, viewed through the third-person perspective of the central character, Kira. Kira herself is a nuanced character, and her growth throughout the novel is well-plotted and riveting. Readers follow along as Kira develops her individual connections with each of her newly found crew of the novel, and though their arcs are not as prominent as Kira’s, each character is engrossing all the same. Despite each character’s flaws, the ragtag team of space adventurers is well worth rooting for.
The downside of this intricately-crafted novel is that though the plot itself is fast-paced, the writing of the novel can be heavy and a little difficult to parse through. This weightiness happens mostly at the beginning of the novel, when the reader is still getting accustomed to the rules of this futuristic world. Once passing this learning curve, the speed of the novel picks up notably, and it’s easy to forget that “To Sleep in a Sea of Stars” is over 800 pages long.
Generally speaking, the novel keeps readers on the edge of their seats with plot twists and turns. Though surprising, these curveballs work well in the world of the novel and none seem unreasonable or like they come out of absolutely nowhere. That said, the ending of the novel felt a little too aloof and neat in relationship with the rest of the novel. While the ending is not wholly unsatisfying, it does pale in comparison to the rest of the flow of the novel.
Despite the ending, “To Sleep in a Sea of Stars” is a thrilling read with powerful prose, a beautifully crafted and innovative universe, and larger than-life-themes focused through fascinating characters. Paolini skillfully wields his writing to fully encapsulate the several-star systems this book spans.

“Emotions come and go, they’re either lovely or abusing.” This statement, found in one of her poems, succinctly epitomizes Halsey’s emotional experiences over the years. Yet no one statement could possibly capture the depth, turbulence, and intensity of emotion the singer-songwriter shares with readers throughout her first collection of poetry.
Born in New Jersey but having since toured the world with her successful musical career, Ashley Nicolette Frangipane is best known by her stage name, Halsey. The chart-topping artist’s talents are not limited to the realm of music, however; Halsey embraces writing as another means of expressing herself in her first collection of poetry, “I Would Leave Me If I Could.” The poems — ranging from short, charged snippets of thought to slightly longer, narrative-style writings — grapple with common themes of love and the way our environments shape us, yet Halsey’s work is far from limited in scope. Her sincerity combines with colorful language and a lyrical, rhythmic writing style to paint a refreshingly unfiltered portrait of humanity. This portrait possesses both self-awareness and reverence for the lives of others, rendering Halsey’s work a uniquely enchanting, thought-provoking, and resonant addition to our society’s growing reflections on mental health.
What strikes readers first about Halsey’s meditations are her mesmerizing images — words that underscore not merely a diversity of emotion, but an intensity as well. Her highs are the highest of highs and her lows are the lowest of lows, and this richness of description, alone, is enough to enchant readers. Halsey herself notes that her “capacity to feel has been stretched” by the fans to whom this book is dedicated. Halsey is familiar with love, hate, and everything between, but to the extreme: She finds “a million dandelions blowing through [her] head / and they are beautiful / But when they come at you like one furious wave / (a few times a day) / They stick in your nose and eyes and ears / You explode from the inside out.” In very little space, Halsey manages to imbue her writing with a violence that seems to burst off the page. It is this richness of emotion that enchants and keeps readers wanting more.
But the richness doesn’t overshadow a deeper reflection on life’s tribulations; rather, this very richness enlivens the frustration Halsey so compellingly expresses — a frustration all can relate to. Halsey describes a sense of futility. She is vulnerable to events beyond her control and subject to the world’s construction. In a poem titled “Hereditary,” Halsey recounts that she’s “whatever I’ve seen on a movie screen”; in another poem, she describes her father’s anger living on through her Punnett square; she titles an additional set of poems “Stockholm Syndrome Pt. 1” and “Pt. 2.” Images of captivity abound — captivity to the whims of those around her and to emotions that have only ever been felt in the extreme.
But perhaps Halsey’s most interesting captivity is that of her own artistic vision. She describes her desire to write as a curse — “a gnat burrowing into your ear / and laying eggs behind the socket of your eye” — and the “Times New Roman print” flowing out of her mouth “a plague of moths from its depths.” Halsey’s craft allows her to do the joys of life justice and describe them with passion, but it obligates her to an endless life of creation nonetheless. This nuance is mirrored in the fluctuations of her writing style, which is at times blunt and unruly and at others light-hearted and lyrical. “I Would Leave Me If I Could” is self-aware and a poignant reflection on the exhausting nature of love-hate relationships with ourselves and our work.
It’s possible for Halsey’s poetry to feel oversaturated, or mired in an impossibly complex individual experience that can’t transcend the voice of its author. But the descriptions of her own feelings are quelled by her inclusion of others’ experiences. Halsey writes of a sadistic former lover with an equally “hungry mind,” her little brother’s growth after the loss of a friend, and the fragmented romantic experiences of a junkie acquaintance, to name a few. Halsey acknowledges the other individually motivated agents in the surrounding world, each a node interacting through charged, meaningful experiences like synapses firing in a neural network. Halsey’s illustration of emotional turbulence is not confined to a purely personal account. [rather, It is a museum of memories belonging to herself and those around her.
As much grief as the intensity of life’s emotion brings her and as much as she relates “trying to rip out [her] own tongue” for yearning to express said emotion artistically, Halsey remains deeply thoughtful toward the experiences of others. Her perception of mental health and the role it plays in her life extends beyond herself. After all, the book is dedicated to fans whom she praises for having shared parts of themselves with her. Halsey has no shortage of fans for her music, but “I Would Leave Me If I Could” proves that her talent for connecting with people transcends mediums.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her debut collection of poems, Joy Priest examines sensation and memory, childhood and adulthood, family and sexuality. Bracingly honest, featuring careful experimentations with form, “Horsepower” is a raw and thoughtful creation.
“Horsepower” is divided into three sections, the collective whole of which is flanked by two poems: “Horsepower” and “Pegasus.” Of all of them, “No Country For Black Boys,” which Priest notes was “written on the occasion of the acquittal of George Zimmerman,” carries the most explicit message –– grief, anger, resentment, resignation, all tied up in a double narrative of a Black boy walking and a white man with a gun. Some poems are half-family histories, mostly of her father’s side, the “family / I do not know / I have” in “Horsepower.” Others are imbued with the sometimes-violent nostalgic sexuality of her later years. Some of them are so deeply personal that they seem as if they weren’t meant to be published.
Each poem could easily stand alone. At first glance they seem largely disparate and unconnected but for the overarching image of horses at the racetrack. But look closer, and slowly Priest unveils the ties between the bits and pieces. In “Self-Portrait As Disney Princess,” she describes bees “glittering with pollen”; in “Junker,” she remembers how her “fingertips glitter / with neon dust… Sometimes I miss her / pollinating everything.” She then carefully draws together the narrative she has built for herself: a runaway horse leaving Kentucky, still looking back.
Now for the highlights. “Rodeo” is a simmering desert-hot thing, a love poem: “Butterflies collide with my / Whipped tail, my / Tremoring eyelashes, my / Heavy teeth.” Priest has a talent for last lines and that of “My Father Teaches Me How To Handle A Pistol” is one of the best: imagining her grandmother, Priest thinks, “I keep [the gun] straight / learn what she was tested by / to get eyes old enough / to hold a bullet still.” The omnipresent image of the horse is, in “Elegy For Kentucky,” a dying black filly, which bleeds into first-person halfway through.
Every poem comes in a different shape. Priest has placed targets between the stanzas of “Upon Reading James Lipton’s “An Exaltation of Larks” and before each page of “Ode To My First Car.” At the beginning of “No Country For Black Boys,” she crushes “iamalwaysthereipatrolifollow” into one smudge of ink. She adds space, fills the page here and leaves it blank there. “In The City” is dirty and pulsing: “redbone rhythm her first time breaths only sound / that ever drowned out the buzz of the city.” Masterfully Priest weaves the blur of the Kentucky heat into the clarity of her vision.
The whole of “Horsepower” is shot through with a strange, buzzing nostalgia. Each theme –– the lingering influence of slavery, misogyny, sexual violence, what it means to be Black in America –– does not reveal itself so much as claw its way out. Reading “Horsepower” is reminiscent of growing pains. It is sympathetic without asking for sympathy, an unflinchingly honest portrayal of life as experienced. “Horsepower” demands to be witnessed.

“The Midnight Library,” best-selling British author Matt Haig’s latest book, tells the story of a woman in her thirties who, after suffering an overwhelming attack of hopelessness and despair, embarks on a journey to rediscover the meaning of life. Unfortunately, the book is as clichéd as it sounds. While initially promising an interesting mix of casual writing with the question of post-mortem existence, “The Midnight Library” ultimately fails to deliver, falling short of the intriguing novel it could have been.
The book begins with what amounts to a cursory overview of the life of Nora Seed and of everything underlying the feelings that drive her to suicide. And while it was certainly a creative choice to begin the book with Nora’s fateful decision, it is here that the most crucial weakness of Haig’s writing reveals itself — namely, his failure to develop characters that are multidimensional and relatable.
For starters, Nora’s fall from grace — which Haig spends the entire book dissecting and rehashing — is too fantastic to be of any use to the average reader. As a reader, it is hard to accept that Nora would go from being a teenage national champion swimmer destined for the Olympics, to an artist on the verge of signing with a major record label, to a broke and unemployed adult with no friends, no significant other, and no family she still talks to; indeed, it is incredibly unrealistic. None of the quirks Haig gives Nora in his desperate lunge at verisimilitude — such as her veganism, an entirely irrelevant detail repeated constantly throughout the novel — make up for the fact that she seems so unlike a real, living person. The result is that no ordinary reader is able to relate to Nora, weakening what could’ve been a much more powerful story.
But as much as parts of her story are overdone, Nora’s emotions do not receive the attention that they deserve from Haig. In general, Haig tends to focus too much of his attention on the plot and on the specific actions taken by the characters, and this has the effect of weakening the appeals to emotion he makes throughout the book. This is felt the most in the two moments where Nora’s emotions drive the plot forward: first when Nora, drowning in despair, decides to end her life, and later when love inevitably changes her mind. Intended to be moments teeming with raw, unbridled emotion, Haig’s decision to not spend enough time developing the emotional side of the novel — either through imagery, metaphor, or simply more creative writing — means that they have no bite. Instead of being rich with feeling, Haig’s writing is superficially descriptive.
As hard as it is to picture Nora as a real person, the supporting characters are even less lifelike. Although Haig’s choice of storyline — in which Nora spends most of her time “trying on” the different lives she could’ve lived — doesn’t lend itself well to great minor character development in the first place, he still makes little effort to bridge the gap. Each minor character is reduced to the relationship they have with Nora and the problem they had with her before she chose to end her life. They are subject to little complication and experience no growth. Haig misses an obvious opportunity to expand the characterization of Hugo, a character trapped, like Nora, between life and death, exploring the different lives he could’ve lived.
Indeed, Hugo is perhaps the most frustrating character of the novel because, again, of what could have been. As the only other character who is consistently himself — because he is also switching between the different lives he might have lived — he is the only person with whom Nora would have been able to develop a dynamic relationship over the course of the novel, one that could have led to personal growth for both of them in an unexpected way.
In fact, after reading Nora’s first extended interaction with him, in which he teaches her about the strange purgatory she is living in, one’s natural inclination is to believe that this will be the direction that the book takes. But this is the only interaction with Hugo that is given much attention, with the only other similar interaction between the two later summarized for the reader in what appears to be a useless blurb of information.
Instead, Haig chooses to pursue the repetitive, predictable plot that reveals itself less than a third of the way into the book. The novel’s ending is predictable. Likewise, its theme — that life is, in the end, worth living — is trite and uninteresting. “The Midnight Library” lacks a twist in either its plot or thematic elements — a twist that the character of Hugo tantalizingly offers — that would’ve given it more substance and made it more worth the reader’s time.
Ultimately, “The Midnight Library” is the story of a missed opportunity. The concept of the book is an intriguing one, but Haig misses the opportunity to create a genuinely interesting story. Instead, he commits to a repetitive, predictable plot with a cliché theme, leaving the reader a story that is best told by the description on its back cover.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gary Golio is an award-winning picture book author hailing from Westchester County, New York. His books tell stories from the lives of musical artists accompanied by breathtaking illustrations; the most recent is about blues guitarist Blind Willie Johnson. He recently sat down with The Harvard Crimson to talk about his latest projects, the process of writing picture books, and his decision to become an author.
The Harvard Crimson: Can you tell us a little bit about your newest book? What was your inspiration for writing it, and what do you see as its most important takeaways?
Gary Golio: First of all, I don’t write for kids really. They’re picture books that are illustrated by fine artists, and I feel that picture books, if they’re well done and the story is gripping, are for anybody of any age. If you ask the Japanese about anime or manga, people that are 80 years old read that stuff, and I kind of feel that picture books, if they’re well done, and the story is gripping, are for anybody of any age. So, I don’t write down to kids. This newest book, “Dark was the Night,” is about a man who was born in 1897; he died in 1945. And if you ask Eric Clapton, or Lucinda Williams, or Jack White, or any number of people, who is the greatest slide guitarist of all time, that is who they’ll say. If you go to YouTube, for example, and you listen to “Dark was the Night,” or any number of songs by Willie Johnson, what you’ll hear is almost unearthly. It’s a beautiful, sonorous voice; it's rough, it's tender, it communicates tremendous emotional feeling. And the slide guitar that he plays on his acoustic guitar is almost like another voice accompanying him. it’s almost a duet… I used to play a lot of blues guitar, so over the years I’ve heard a lot about Willie, and several years ago I read this story again about how he died in poverty in 1945 and was forgotten, and the process of how his song ended up on the Voyager 1 space probe, on this amazing golden record. To me, the whole thing is very inspiring, because it says, “You never know what’s going to come of your life and how you’re going to influence people.”
THC: Almost all the books you’ve written tell the story of different musical artists. What’s been your inspiration for choosing the story of these musical artists to be the focus of your book?
GG: I was a therapist for many years — a psychotherapist, a clinical social worker — and I worked with a lot of teens — adults as well — but teens who had addiction troubles and who had had very difficult circumstances and challenges in their lives, and everyone loves music. When I look at somebody like Jimi Hendrix or John Coltrane or Billie Holiday, I see in their early years the roots of everything they became. That’s partially my perspective as a therapist, but it’s also my love of music. It kind of points you to the root source of things. I wrote these books because I felt they were roadmaps for people, that you could look at the early years of Jimi Hendrix or John Coltrane or Charlie Chaplin — that’s another one of my books — and if you were looking for an example, a role model, an inspiration . . . that these books could give you something to chew on.
THC: What made you decide to become an author of picture books after working as a social worker, and as a fine artist before that?
GG: I went to SUNY Purchase, the visual arts department, and I sold my work to a lot of corporate collections and individuals in the United States for many years, landscape paintings of the Hudson Valley… I sort of had a little midlife crisis of my own at 40 years old, and I went back to get my Master’s in clinical social work… Then I started working with young people who had been, unfortunately, sexually abused, kids who had serious addiction troubles and adults who had the same problems. I felt like it was all sort of the same. To me, being an artist is taking a look at quality and being really good and determined to be good at whatever you do. Whether you’re a car mechanic or a hairdresser or a dentist, you can be an artist in terms of the way you approach whatever it is you love to do.
After a while my wife had become a very celebrated children’s book author, and she was writing biographies, and one day she said, “What are you doing at your desk?”... And I said, “I’m writing a picture book,” and she said, “Really? About whom?” and I said, “It’s about the early years of Jimi Hendrix growing up in Seattle.” And she thought it was a little crazy, but then she sort of came around ... It took a little while to get it off the ground, but it was exciting for me, because as a kid, I loved Marvel Comics. In the early sixties, there I was as a young boy, and those things were just coming out — Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four and all of these different superhero groups, Doctor Strange — and it was very inspiring to me. So people say, “Oh, you’re an author, you must have read a lot of books as a kid.” In fact, I really didn’t. I read a lot of comic books.
THC: Can you talk a little bit more about writing picture books in particular? What are some challenges that are unique to writing a picture book?
GG: People don’t always understand that if I do a picture book about someone that’s a biography, first of all, for me, it has to be accurate. It has to be based on facts; it has to be based on the history. I don’t make up dialogues for Willie, or anyone. I base it on a lot of research that usually takes months to do, and then the real challenge is how to distill that into a text... You have to be kind of ruthless. You can write beautifully and poetically, but you want to really condense and distill those ideas. . . . You don’t want to write down, because kids are extremely smart. They pick up everything. But there are things in a person’s life that aren’t necessarily important. The Jimi Hendrix book — it’s about him as a child, but in the back matter, I talk about addiction as an addictions therapist. I talk about resources that people can call upon if they’re seeing their kids or grandkids having troubles in that way. You always have to know who your audience is, and I think you have to write with as much truth and honesty as you can, and also at the same time — and this is why it’s tough — you also want to tell a story that has drama to it.
THC: As someone with a background in the arts, can you outline for us how you work with illustrators to ensure that your vision for a book is reflected in the final product?
GG: 99 percent of the time in children’s book work, if you are an author and you sell a story to a publisher and it’s going to become a picture book that’s going to be illustrated by a fine artist, you don’t even meet the illustrator; you don’t get to talk to them. . . But just the way my life turned out, I got to know a lot of artists who are illustrators in the field, and I’d bring them work. . . . [The illustrator for my newest book, E. B. Lewis, and I] just came up with a project — in fact, we just sold a project about a man named William Carney, who was a Black soldier in the Civil War and the first to be awarded the Medal of Honor. So, it’s gotten to the point where that’s what I do, but it’s not the routine way of doing things. What you do have to do as an author is you have to trust — whether you’ve suggested an artist or the editor has chosen an artist, which is what usually happens — that they know what they’re doing, that they’re going to respect your work.
THC: What is the most rewarding part of being a picture book author?
GG: I do a lot of interviews about my books. especially when they’re about music, I do a lot of interviews with DJs on radio stations across the country. It’s wonderful to have somebody interview you while they’re playing that song — whether it’s by Jimi Hendrix or John Coltrane or Billie Holiday or Blind Willie Johnson — in the background while you’re talking about their life. I try to approach it with a lot of humility, because it’s not about me, it’s about this person — whose work I really love — and their life … So at that point, I just let it go — it’s not mine anymore — and put it out into the world, and I just watch what happens.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Bookstore, a locally owned and operated independent bookstore just beyond the yard gates, has been open since 1932. Known for their author events, unique atmosphere, and enthralling book collection, the Harvard Bookstore is a beloved feature of Harvard Square. The Harvard Crimson interviewed the General Manager of the Harvard Bookstore, Alex Meriwether, about holiday shopping, author events, and running an independent bookstore in the midst of the pandemic.
The Harvard Crimson: What does your role at the Harvard Bookstore entail? And how has that changed with the COVID-19 pandemic?
Alex Meriwether: As a general manager, I work on all the aspects of running the business with the management team and our owners. [Responding to the pandemic] has involved a lot of decisions on where to change procedure, where to change job roles and functions in the store. As there's been so much change with how we serve our community of book lovers and shoppers, I do quite a bit with our marketing and outreach efforts, work with our events and marketing manager on our newsletters, and a little bit of our social media.
THC: How different are the operations of the bookstore now compared to when the pandemic first hit in March?
AM: We've definitely gone through different phases. Since things started to shift in March, we made the decision to close to the public. For a brief period, we were doing curbside pickup and then we were just doing mail out. When things were peaking in Massachusetts, we completely shut down on-site operations. Our staff was basically all remote and they were working on doing book recommendations. We had a forum set up on our website called “Ask a Bookseller” where customers would write in looking for a book recommendation, and book sellers would send them a bunch of suggestions which they could order on our website. Orders were coming through us [and] were getting shipped directly to customers from wholesaler warehouses. We upped our email marketing and our social media during that time. That was a very distinct time where we weren't an in-person bookstore.
Then [we] slowly phased back in June. We started fulfilling orders from the store again, setting up safe social distanced workspaces in the store and not having customers in just yet. Then at the beginning of July, we opened up again to the public, with limited hours and very limited capacity. We've continued curbside contactless pickup and mail out of books. We’re open with a lot of focus on safety: Plexiglass barriers at the register and information desk and air purifiers around the store. We’ve kind of settled into this phase since then. Mid-October, while our operations to the public largely haven't seemed to change, we've begun a big push to encourage folks to shop early for holidays. We put out an open letter from our owners, which is still posted on our website, harvard.com, just giving you a sense of the financial state of the business. I mean, revenue is way, way down.
Events are such a huge part of our identity as a bookstore. We hosted hundreds of author events a year, everything from 15 people gathered in the bookstore to see a debut author who may go on to win the Pulitzer Prize in a few years, to a local author in the store and then 100 people who come to see them, to hundreds of people at offsite events that are ticketed. We switched to the virtual Zoom events in March, and those have been greatly successful. It was an honor to be named the Best Virtual Author series by Boston Magazine. Our events team has done just a tremendous job with introducing authors from their homes rather than doing so in the bookstore from the front of the crowd. We've had great attendance to those events, but it's not the same experience as getting to meet an author and have them sign a book for you.
We kind of kicked off our holiday shop early for the holidays initiative with a bang and with our annual sale, which we also moved earlier, usually they would have been [in early November] but we did it mid-October this year instead. We were blown away by the response to the letter and to our sale. It's just the beginning of what we need to sustain sustain ourselves and the staff, so we're keeping the messaging going that we're not going to have a crowded, bustling bookstore in the week before the holidays in December this year, so we need to stretch that holiday shopping season over a couple months rather than a couple of weeks.
We've always had a pretty robust web presence, gave attention to our email newsletter and our website, making harvard.com a shopping experience [that reflects] shopping in the store as much as we can, but web sales become a much bigger part of the business than they were before. The other huge operational shift was in preparation for mid-October, pre-holiday push we closed our used book bargain basement to the public in order to spread out our workspace for staff to [have] socially distanced workstations to collect and prepare online orders, which has just been critical given the huge influx of online orders the last few weeks.
THC: Are there any kind of benefits or upsides to the programming you've made? Whether that be your approach to events, your approach to marketing and email lists that you can see the Harvard Bookstore implementing even after the pandemic is over and we're back to normal?
AM: The Virtual Author Series write-up in Boston Magazine noted, something that is kind of magical about doing the virtual events is: For event series we would often pair a speaker with a noted journalist or scholar or someone else working in that person's field, and that would almost always be someone local. But given the virtual nature of things, location is no longer a factor. It's really opened up the possibilities of who we can bring on to join authors in conversation, to give more of that kind of live event dynamism that we're missing out on not having an audience and speaker all gathered in the same space. For instance, critic Gail Caldwell, she was a long time book critic for The Boston Globe. She had a memoir this spring and it addressed in part how important the women's rights movement was to her and her life. We had Gloria Steinem as her interviewer, which was just amazing. The virtual interface opens up who can tune in to them. We have people from all over the world turning into our author events. We've heard from customers who have moved away years ago and missed our author events and who have been able to virtually attend them these last seven months, which has been great. So I think it certainly does point to perhaps combining the virtual event with the live event more in the future, when it's safe to have in person events.
THC: Can you speak a little bit to how the Harvard book store community has changed or adapted?
AM: It's just overall a shift away from in person shopping and to shopping at harvard.com, and that's affected both our customers and our staff. Before this, we had one main person dedicated to processing web orders and we would dedicate additional people when we would have our annual sale for instance. But we now have a whole team of staff both on-site and staff working remotely from home working on processing orders, doing the internal processing and so much paperwork for them, doing the on-site gathering of books, boxing them up. I will say everything feels so much less efficient than it once was.
When we redesigned our website many years ago, we did so with the idea that it mimicked some of the feel of shopping in the store. I'm so grateful that we took that approach because we don't want folks to forget what is so special about discovery and browsing the shelves since it is a limited number of people who are able to do so these days with our limited capacity and people's limited ability, in some cases, to go to stores.
I think just figuring out how to do what we do best, which is recommend books, serve our customers, [and] reflect the interests of our community with a selection of books on our shelves in a socially distant way. We're not leading customers through the aisles in the same way we used to, picking books off the shelf, putting them in their arms, so we're trying to find ways to do that in a more distanced way in the coming months, especially with the holidays coming up.
THC: We've talked about this kind of sporadically throughout the interview, but how can the community best support independent bookstores at this time?
AM: I think just continuing to shop with them regularly. And understanding that it's going to be a long haul. It's gonna be awhile before any stores are back to where it's safe and prudent to be the kind of community gathering places that made bookstores special.
I started as a bookseller in the store, 16 years ago, and certainly had my share of recommending a book to someone and they'll say, “Okay, thanks so much. I'm gonna go buy it on Amazon.” So the sign we've had up in the store was: “find it here, buy it here, keep us here” — just messaging that books you're discovering at your local bookstore, don't go buying [them] on Amazon because it's like a dollar cheaper, especially if you discovered it through the thoughtfulness of your local bookseller. Continued patronage best serves and supports bookstores. And allowing for some delays and being patient at times, when it's a struggle to be as efficient as we used to be. Expenses are up, despite revenue being down, and that's a struggle. But we're still the smart, passionate, people we've always been, ready to recommend books and put them in our customers hands, even if it is virtually putting them in their hands.

Our writers turned to books for solace throughout quarantine: Here are their top picks for what soothed them most.
‘Just Kids’ — Patti Smith
Sofia Andrade, Crimson Staff Writer
“Why can’t I write something that would wake the dead? That pursuit is what burns most deeply,” Patti Smith writes in her memoir and love letter to New York City, “Just Kids.” Reading these lines in quarantine — as coronavirus numbers kept rising and my family retreated further into isolation — was cathartic. Though I first opened the book back on campus in February, I spent much of my summer immersed in the confessions and constellations of Patti Smith, reading and rereading her accounts of Chelsea Hotel bohemia and her relationship with the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. She describes living her youth in search of poets, of bleeding hearts and artists, of hearts full and broken and mended together as though she is herself inventing the world with each black-inked letter. Romanticism bleeds through the pages of “Just Kids” as though that were the only way for such a love story to exist. I spent months living vicariously through Smith’s poetic landscapes, letting every last word linger just as my summer days did. Through her bountiful descriptions of Mapplethorpe and New York in the 60s and 70s, Smith achieved that pursuit which “burns most deeply”: She woke the dead.
'The Castle' — Franz Kafka
Lance R. He, Contributing Writer
The bad part? The repetitive slog of rejection. The worst part? “The Castle” remains unfinished. Dreadfully idyllic summer days creep alongwhile I'm trapped, alone, in my little castle in hellish Texas heat. Like any sane person, I decide to read “The Castle.” You've heard of him, Kafka; this book of his can best be described as, well, oppressively Kafkaesque. Whenever K., a hired foreign surveyor, tries to approach the titular castle and meet his employer, he is denied access and ostracized by the vicious members of the surrounding village. A master of his craft, Kafka inspired within me an emptiness, the same from which K. yearned for adventure and truth. He reminded me that, while I melted under the sweltering heat scrolling through daily haunting news in déjà vu, I still had agency to take action. So I took action. I reveled in other great novels, and yet I always came back to “The Castle.” Its preposterous allure draws me in with absolute denial... Can I come in?
‘Children of Blood and Bone’—Tomi Adeyemi
Madi L. Fabber, Contributing Writer
When we were sent home in March, I found myself in desperate need of escapism, so I turned to my tried and true love: YA Fantasy. I spent the summer pouring through all of the recent releases I had missed, but the book that stands out most spectacularly as a defining book of my reading list is Tomi Adeyemi’s debut novel, “Children of Blood and Bone.” Adeyemi’s writing whisked me away to a world of magic, adventure, and unbelievably high stakes. “Children of Blood and Bone” also features an excellently crafted world inspired by West African folklore that is so well constructed it leaps off the page. Combined with a suite of four main characters, this book expertly navigates nuanced depictions of love, hatred, trauma, and family dynamics — making for a truly impactful novel that is impossible to put down. “Children of Blood and Bone” is the first installment in a brilliant trilogy, and I can say with enthusiasm that I cannot wait to devour the final book in the series when it is released next year.
'Six of Crows' — Leigh Bardugo
Millie Mae Healy, Contributing Writer
What do you do when you desperately want to leave somewhere, but cannot for the safety of yourself, your family, and the general populace? Read about a group of misfits who desperately want to get into somewhere, apparently. “Six of Crows” is a masterful fantasy heist about six formidable teenage criminals with complicated pasts. It’s the perfect heist: aware of the tropes of the genre without being self-congratulatory every time it side-steps a cliche, yet remaining equal parts surprising, heart-stopping and — at thematically appropriate moments — hilarious. The motley crew of protagonists are fantastically diverse, well-rounded, and compelling despite (or because of) their talent for illegal activity. Perhaps my favorite thing about this book is the impeccable character growth among the protagonists: The stakes are just right and the emotional development lines up with the action in a gorgeously satisfying way that made me remember what it was like to feel things.
'The Adrienne Kennedy Reader' — Adrienne Kennedy
Alejandro C. Eduarte, Contributing Writer
“‘Did you know there’s love in the world,” he said. “Did you know it?’,” writes Adrienne Kennedy in the opening story of her collected works. The collection, which takes readers from the Tower of London to Ohio to Greece to New York City and far beyond, includes essays, short stories, and letters — but most prominent are its plays. In the wake of the temporary loss of large-scale live shows, Kennedy’s fragmented, incantatory language not only brought me back to those scenes of performance and collective breath-holding possible in theater, but also taught me how little I know of myself as a human, since my life in the world is essentially all performance — and now, in quarantine, that capacity to perform has mostly fallen away. Questions of who I am, who we are, and what we should do in the world abound in that silence arise, in that space away from both the theater and collective life. Kennedy’s plays help fill that gap. Her ever-wistful characters (including Beethoven, Greeks, Jesus, and 1950s Hollywood stars) often long for family, lineage, and healing, and display just how hard it is to be a person in a world that constantly seeks to displace them from where they want to belong. These surreal plays show us how, once we accept that our identities are constantly mutable, we can create lives that are more experimental, tricky, tragic, clever, and full of love than we could have had otherwise.
'Throne of Glass' — Sarah J. Maas

At first, “Throne of Glass” was simply a form of escapism for me. There’s a gorgeous assassin, a handsome prince, an evil king, and a fight-to-the-death competition. I thought the writing style was a little jejune, but it allowed for rapid consumption; I, in turn, allowed myself to get lost in its pages. But as the series progressed, the writing style and the story began to evolve and open up. “Throne of Glass” hooked me as an innocent fairy tale, but wound up blossoming into an epic fantasy saga on par with “The Lord of the Rings” or “Game of Thrones.” I have come to care deeply about all of the characters in Maas’s world, and I am dreading the day that I finish the last book.
Don Tillman Series ('The Rosie Project,' 'The Rosie Effect,' and 'The Rosie Result') — Graeme Simsion
Emi P. Cummings, Contributing Writer
On what seemed like day 2,457 of quarantine, I discovered a charming and warm-hearted novel titled “The Rosie Project,” the first work in the three-part Don Tillman series. Written by Australian IT consultant Graeme Simsion, the trilogy follows the romantic, familial, social, and professional trajectories of Don, a socially awkward geneticist who is so tone-deaf that he seemingly forgets on several occasions that irony exists. Don’s escapade — which features more twists and turns than a roller coaster — begins with a meticulously designed questionnaire that he produces in hopes of finding a suitable wife. What could possibly go wrong? Unsurprisingly, many, many things. But the havoc unleashed by Don and his emotions is what makes Simsion’s collection of novels so amusing. All three books feature characteristics of a consistently entertaining series: superb pacing, razor-sharp dialogue, an endearing couple to cheer on, slapstick humor, and boisterous physical pursuits. A victorious screwball comedy that delights readers while providing valuable insight into topics ranging from parenting to cocktail making, the “Rosie” trilogy was, and still is, the perfect companion to the couch, my imagination, and rare idle hours.
'Conversations with Friends' — Sally Rooney
Mira S. Alpers, Contributing Writer
When I found myself back in my childhood bedroom last March, I knew I had to re-read “Conversations with Friends.” The novel follows college-aged Frances and her friend/ex-girlfriend Bobbi, as their lives intersect with those of Melissa, a photographer, and Nick, her actor husband. “Conversations with Friends” had been one of my favorite books before coronavirus, but, reading it this second time, the book took on new importance to me. Rooney’s characters may not have been living through a pandemic, but the way they communicated their listlessness, their true desires for love and connection, and the estrangement they felt from the world around them resonated so acutely with my “new normal.” For example, at one point in the novel, Frances fittingly remarks, “Gradually the waiting began to feel less like waiting and more like this was simply what life was: the distracting tasks undertaken while the thing you are waiting for continues not to happen.” For me, “Conversations with Friends” also served as a form of escapism. Not only does it take place in a pre-pandemic world, but the central romance is endearing, exciting, and just plain fun. Rooney is also a fantastic writer — with a deep understanding of how people talk, both to each other and to themselves. This novel is a perfect read for anyone who not only wants to immerse themselves in the lives of a group of compelling characters, but who also wants to get to understand their own emotions better.
'Slaughterhouse 5' — Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
Mikel J. Davies, Staff Writer
Growing up in rural Idaho and being thrust back into my childhood by the pandemic and state-mandated stay-at-home orders, I thought: what better book to read than my high school English teacher’s go-to recommendation — “Slaughterhouse 5.” And what an apt choice it was. Slipping into the story of Billy Pilgrim was a perfect release from the grim reality of 2020. Why not travel through time and space in Vonnegut’s abstract anti-war, sci-fi adventure through World War II and the far-off planet of Tralfamadore. Vonnegut’s incredible — though sometimes perplexing — writing sheds a bit of light on the ever-changing world of today. Billy Pilgrim went through life as little more than a bump on a log, just waiting for things to pass him by, hoping something decent would happen every now and then. Luckily for him, he got to spend a hot minute naked in a Tralfamadorian Zoo with Montana Wildhack, and I got to experience the thrilling escape from reality throughout the off-kilter story. The breakneck transitions between times and places of the story might not be for everyone, but in a world as chaotic and seemingly far fetched as the one of Billy Pilgrim, “Slaughterhouse 5” is an endearing and enjoyable read that tells its audience to be wary of war and quick to friendship — even if they might disappear in the firebombing of Dresden one day. So it goes.

'The Raven Cycle' — Maggie Stiefvater
Nuri Bhuiyan, Staff Writer
I remember reading the first installment of this four-book series during my senior year of high school. I was set on a quick accent love story, and although most of the dust jacket description was about a group of friends in their search for a magical Welsh king, I hoped the multiple mentions of true love would make it sufficiently romantic. I quickly realized it was much more than that and stopped halfway through. Now, two years later, as I near the end of the fourth and last book, “The Raven King,” I’m glad I abandoned it then — because to rediscover this gorgeous story of love and desire and dreams during this time of extreme isolation has been such a gift. The writing is at once meandering and detailed — but also focused, and overall so intensely psychoanalytical that I cannot count the number of times I thought to myself: “Wow, I’ve never felt more understood.” The past few months getting to know Ronan, Gansey, Adam, Blue, and the rest of characters, along with the beautifully meditative Henrietta, Virginia that holds them all, have been incredible. I’ll remember things these infinitely interesting people have thought or said or qualities of the spaces they occupy for days. The world Maggie Stiefvater has created in this series is just so fantastical and spectacular, yet so permeated by humanity — a reality that feels necessary and even natural during such a disorienting time.

Three of our writers dive into what books they're reading over break, and why.
‘Twilight’ — Stephanie Meyers
Mira S. Alpers, Contributing Writer
Somehow, I have never read or watched “Twilight.” I was a little too young at the height of the series’ prominence, and did not get a chance to dive into the wacky world of Bella Swan and her immortal vampire boyfriend. It makes sense that I feel just a little culturally illiterate. In reading “Twilight” this winter break I hope to find answers to several key questions. Is it true vampires sparkle? Can love withstand the pressures of a 100-year age gap? And, most importantly, am I Team Edward or Team Jacob? Only through the words of Stephenie Meyer will I ever come to any conclusion about these pressing issues. Though, if I’m being honest with myself, I might just watch the movies.
“Wayward Son” — Rainbow Rowell
Millie Mae Healy, Contributing Writer
This is the sequel to Rowell’s 2015 book “Carry On: The Rise and Fall of Simon Snow.” If you know what this means: it’s a “what might have been” for if Drarry had happened in a different, uniquely clever magic system. If not, it manages to be a story that is both about a teenage “Chosen One” caught in brewing political magic wars while also facing an insidious threat to all of magic, as well as an LBGTQ+ coming of age story of self-discovery. “Wayward Son” picks up where “Carry On” left off with the surviving characters going on an accidentally emotionally cathartic road-trip. It’s a surprising, hilarious, and heartfelt story about what happens after the happily ever after, and coming to terms with not ending up where you expected to, and how that’s okay — even better than okay. Since we can’t go anywhere at the moment, I figure now is the perfect time to read about Brits driving from Chicago to San Diego, severely underestimating the distance, and having one hell of a journey.
“On The Road” — Jack Kerouac
Sofia Andrade, Staff Writer
I admit, Jack Kerouac’s 1957 ode to ‘60s counterculture has been sitting on my desk for months now. Reading about the freedom of Kerouac’s travels while neck-deep in responsibilities just didn’t seem right. In “On the Road,” Kerouac immortalizes the Beat generation and its icons, including Allen Ginsburg and William Borroughs, in glowing infamy. Throughout, Kerouac’s lyrical prose contrasts with the wildness of the novel’s crass imagery to create a striking sense of urgency grounded only by the novel’s extreme hyperbole. The book, supposedly based on Kerouac’s own travels with his friends, is the perfect escape from the pandemic-induced stagnation many of us find ourselves in. Kerouac restlessly blazes through his adventures in travel, jazz, and, most prominently, psychedelics, while readers can take it all in from the comfort of their own home. An ode to the great American road trip as much as it is an ode to the unfettered nature of the Beats, “On the Road” promises to be just outlandish and exuberant enough to push readers out from the four walls they may find themselves trapped by.

Oh, Nicki.
“Pink Friday” is, arguably, one of the best albums ever made. Nicki Minaj’s singular 2010 debut, in the ever-erratic matrix of 21st century pop culture, demands a spot at the front of the pack. From the Greek myth-level first track, “I’m The Best,” she cements her campy lyrical style and, over the remaining 13 tracks, recruits a class of A-listers for her album-length takedown of any and all critics’ expectations. She is at once the decade’s pop cultural blueprint and its muse, certainly the most joyous, confounding woman rapper of the past decade — and the album that launched her onto the A-list is a blast of giddy, unforgettable fun.
As is well-known by fans, Minaj came from Trinidad to Queens, shuttled through LaGuardia High, and spent nights working at Red Lobster while in an off-Broadway play — juggling various short-term recording contracts until 2009. With a barrage of features (most notably Kanye West’s “Monster”) under her belt, she signed with Lil Wayne’s Cash Money Records in 2009 to release a pop-influenced album. In a 2010 interview for Entertainment Weekly, Minaj proclaimed, “I felt like for so many years I was the girl who did the catchy little raps, and it's time for me now to tell my story, and in telling my story, I'm really telling every girl's story.”
The album see-saws between high-intensity pop confections, gritty rap tracks, and quasi-rock songs — an uneven trio to pull off her stated objective, even in theory. But the fissures between these genres are exactly the point. Who else would dare sample Annie Lennox on a track that flies through Biblical metaphors, features a video cloaked in Enya-adjacent capes, and has a pre-chorus with the line “And for your loving, I’ma die hard like Bruce Willis”? Who else would spin an alter-ego of a vengeful Roman and the refrain “Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon” into a song with the scale of a feature film? The list of risks goes on and on. It doesn’t matter that some of the ambition falls into corniness and disarray, or that some of the confessional lyrics overestimate their true heft. This album, as Minaj intended, can be every girl’s story because there are so many expansive possibilities packed inside.
Amid this whirlpool of energy, sentimentality remains at the base of Minaj’s productions. “Super Bass” is both a banging classic made for group-rapping and an almost heartbreaking ask for romance before the object of her affection loses interest. “Moment 4 Life” is at once a premonition of her monumental career and a recognition that it’ll pass. These songs are whimsical, trap-pop endorsements of this seminal message: Minaj’s intimacy is no joke.
It’s all, in a way, queer. As club songs blur into ballads, listeners must stay alert to how the project will shapeshift next. Her experimentations with vocal performance (her pitch and tone glides, and those rolled r’s!) astound in their humor; she knows how to work a microphone to massive effect. Any possible sonic and emotional boundary in her way is paid no mind. It’s also, in case the cutting raps weren’t enough, a warning: do not mess with Nicki Minaj.
This sensibility birthed the Barbz, the most ruthless intelligence force the world has ever known. Named for Minaj’s focus on the Barbie (her subversion of Disney cotton-candy tropes is another stroke of brilliance), this amorphous group of stans will expose and shame racists, go after anybody who says as much as one negative word about their queen, and fancam until they die. They have followed Minaj throughout her career, carrying hilarity, scamming, and a fair share of infamy in their wake, and have spearheaded an irreverently hive-minded model of online engagement in celebrity culture.
Minaj carries the monumental weight of culture behind her, not just in her fashion, music videos, and fanbase, but in the very grammar of online humor. A disproportionate number of the cheeky clapbacks used in online discourse can be harkened back to some shock of a Minaj lyric, or “did-she-really-say-that?” quote. Lil Nas X, the Gen Z darling who last year usurped Mariah Carey’s spot for the longest-running Billboard Hot 100 song, just confirmed the long-running rumors that he kickstarted his superstardom as the owner of none other than a Minaj fan account.
And yet Minaj’s project is not, and was never, all new. Look at the daring of Missy Elliot’s concept albums, think about Lil’ Kim’s sex appeal, consider Queen Latifah’s bragaddocio and Mary J. Blige’s swagger. Minaj’s album threads all of these women’s influences into its toughness and ease, its obsession with being the absolute best. She has the world of women rappers to both thank and vehemently criticize — ensuring she will have a legacy amongst these names, one equally charged with controversy as with triumph. But, as Minaj’s daring debut proves, both controversy and rigor of craft is necessary for her stardom, many might say icon-status, to have any lasting meaning at all.
Minaj, as is required to survive as an A-lister in the capitalist flows of the global pop scene, has dutifully grown the album’s brand into a perfume, bunches of merch, and two follow-up LPs: “Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded'' and “Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up.” If “Pink Friday” is akin to a debut novel, these two albums are in effect a short story collection — the former a dancepop showcase, and the latter a more bracing, trap-laced work — both expanding and honoring the original. The follow-ups allow listeners to hear Minaj’s artistic interests when they have room to breathe and grow, her brand blooming along with the music. Take a glance through some of the enduring tracks, “Beez In The Trap”, “High School”, and, of course, “Stupid Hoe”, and the throughline from “Pink Friday”’s aerobic charisma is undeniable. The risk of the album did, in nearly every sense of the word, pay off.
On “Roman’s Revenge," Minaj asks, “Is the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on?” If she didn’t receive her gratitude then, she certainly does now, and in droves. In myriad ways, fans are still tethered to the artistic vision of “Pink Friday,” the album that catapulted Minaj onto the world’s stage. For any still in doubt of her roaring power, she leaves them this assured message on “I’m The Best,” having already proved herself: “You might get addressed on the second album,” she raps, and then speeds right on her way to the top.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’d be hard-pressed to encounter someone who isn’t familiar with “Hamilton,” Lin-Manuel Miranda’s critically acclaimed musical about United States founding father Alexander Hamilton. A Broadway production deemed so sensational that a full recording of the original cast’s performance was released on Disney+, “Hamilton'' is a cultural phenomenon that challenges the ubiquity of whitewashing in American theater by selecting BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) actors to play white historical figures. But the progressiveness reflected in this racial diversity, which fans and critics alike celebrate, is also a source of controversy. Is “Hamilton'' really that innovative if it fundamentally engages in an absurd form of racism known as color-blind casting?
A similar question arose last month when it was revealed Black actress Jodie Turner-Smith would portray Anne Boleyn, Queen of England from 1533 to 1536, in a three-part Channel 5 series. Unsurprisingly, this news was met with varied responses. Some expressed their anger about a Black woman playing a white historical figure while others remarked on their desire to see Black actors in new narratives created by, for, and about people of color.
Recent examples of color-blind casting — casting that does not take race or ethnicity into account — reveal the complexities that develop when exclusion and rejection of authenticity are disguised as an egalitarian artistic convention. Its problematic, if not racist, nature is mostly overt — e.g. white actresses Scarlett Johansson and Emma Stone playing characters of Asian descent — but it can be covert, as is the case with “Hamilton” and Turner-Smith’s upcoming Channel 5 series.
The perils of color-blind casting in “Hamilton'' are especially difficult to detect. For one, many consider it an example of color-conscious casting rather than color-blind casting. The latter is a practice rejecting the past and present in favor of an idealized post-racial future which it is desperate to symbolize. On the contrary, the former is cemented in the present and examines race and ethnicity during the audition process. Lin-Manuel Miranda, director Thomas Kail, and casting directors Bethany Knox and Bernie Telsey did exactly this by choosing to only cast white actors in one key part and a few small ensemble roles. In essence, they otherwise barred the actors from the cast to make room for artists of color. (The casting call for the Chicago production of “Hamilton” specified “non-white” for all but one of the major roles.)
Yet, reserving space for BIPOC performers is only one element of a successful color-conscious approach. Effective color-conscious casting places greater responsibility on the writer, director, and casting directors to execute an in-depth evaluation of the cultural connotations of requesting an actor insert themselves into a narrative that is not their own. Ideally, they will ensure marginalized actors are not burdened by their racial transcendence and, if need be, adapt the production to better suit their needs and perspectives.
Miranda’s show does not align with those principles. Although the ‘woke’ composer and lyricist prioritizes diversifying his production, he blindly asks BIPOC performers to act in a piece detailing historical events benefiting their oppressors. These roles diverge to a significant degree from the actors’ own rich familial and ancestral histories, which are just as worthy of sharing with the world as Alexander Hamilton’s is. Curiously, the change in race does not lead to a shift in the characters’ viewpoints and experiences, even if Black artists are personating slave owners or individuals related to them. Predominantly white audiences’ tendency to overlook this discrepancy between the complexion of the actor and the historical context of their role is reflective of what, among other factors, has allowed color-blind casting to persist for so long — the unquestioning acceptance of superficial diversity and inclusivity.
“Hamilton” may be a revolutionary Black, brown, and multicolored agent of change on the outside, but it is a mainstream white history lesson on the inside: a history lesson taught through fantastic music, entrancing choreography, nuanced acting, and terrific set design. It is crucial, then, to separate how the show is brought to life artistically from who brings the show to life and why. “Hamilton”’s method of conveying history is problematic but it nevertheless redefines the boundaries of theater by foregrounding innovation, hip-hop, and BIPOC talent.
This duality is evident in other facets of the work. Despite taking race and ethnicity into account during the initial stages of production, the musical ultimately subscribes to the same racist notion characterizing color-blind casting. Co-occurring with inventive rap sequences and punchy dance numbers is the inadvertent implication that it is reasonable to not see race as well as its influence on the lens through which a story is viewed.
Given “Hamilton’s” duality, it may be more appropriate to understand Manuel-Miranda, Kail, Knox, and Telsey’s casting techniques as an enigmatic hybrid of color-blindness and color-consciousness. Indeed, the subtle distinction renders it nearly impossible to determine whether the external merits of “Hamilton” overpower its internal demerits.
That isn’t to say clear stances for or against color-blind casting haven’t been established in years past. Black American playwright August Wilson presents a preeminent argument against color-blind casting in “The Ground on Which I Stand,” an address that he delivered at the 1996 TCG (Theatre Communications Group) Conference. “The idea of colorblind casting,” he stated, “is the same idea of assimilation that black Americans have been rejecting for the past 380 years." It is an “attempt to blot [racial and ethnic minorities] out” and “reinvent history," he said. It is an “assault on [the BIPOC] presence…an insult to [their] intelligence…and [their] many and varied contributions to the society and world at large.” According to Wilson, “mount[ing] an [all-BIPOC] production” of a play or musical “conceived for white actors as an investigation of the human condition through the specifics of white culture is to deny [the actors their] own humanity, [their] own history, and the need to make [their] own investigations from the cultural ground on which [they] stand."
Of course, the cultural ground on which Wilson stood in 1996 is far different from the one audiences stand on in 2020. Still, the racist sentiment expressed by color-blind casting remains an issue. With the exception of productions such as “Hamilton,” which cannot be precisely described as color-blind or color-conscious, all color-blind castings are questionable and should be avoided, specifically when they cast a white person to play a BIPOC character.
Any moment a white actor adopts the role of a person of color and vice-versa, there is an underlying suggestion all humans navigate their surrounding environments in the same manner. Race and ethnicity are minimized and reduced to negligible factors that can be transferred from person to person. In reality, one’s racial identity is an inalienable entity paramount to how they perceive themselves and are received by others. This has long gone ignored in all mediums of production: Natalie Wood, an actress of Russian descent, played Maria, the Puerto Rican lead in “West Side Story”; until recently, “The Simpsons” featured white actors voicing Black and South Asian characters; and Jonathan Pryce wore prosthetics to transform into a Eurasian nightclub owner in the original West End performance of “Miss Saigon.” All three scenarios mark instances where white actors are thrust into the limelight for appropriating an unfamiliar culture and lifestyle.
Those who deny the whitewashing prompted by color-blind casting may reinforce their convictions by contending that an actor’s role is to assume identities different from their own, even in terms of race. After all, one of the key tenets of the art form is what poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge coined as “the willing suspension of disbelief.” Audience members are expected to submit to the world of the production, no matter how unrealistic it may be. Yet, it hardly seems appropriate to equate matters of racial identity with, say, a willing suspension of disbelief required to watch a man turn into a scarecrow in “The Wizard of Oz."
How, then, should writers, directors, casting directors, producers, and executives account for the rising demand to see non-white faces on the stage and the screen? First, they must consider, rather than ignore, ethnic background and race. It is essential to many individuals' selfhood and there is a necessity for it to be treated as such. Second, they must realize that blindness is not representation — consciousness is. The replacement of color-blind approaches with color-conscious methodologies is indispensable.
It is not enough, however, to be merely aware of the BIPOC bodies present in film, television, and theatre — it is imperative to identify and challenge the prejudices and stereotypes white audiences have attached, and continue to attach, to these bodies. Moreover, those possessing creative and management responsibility for productions must discern the socio-political and cultural implications of the on-screen, on-stage existence of bodies of color. “Hamilton’s” inability to do so should serve as a clarion call to artists in power to clarify the standards of constructive casting strategies and reimagine the possibilities for change when there is a collective adoption of color-conscious mentality.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is an exigency for writers, directors, casting directors, producers, and executives to admit that neither color-blind nor color-conscious casting can function as an alternative to the global distribution of stories brought to fruition by BIPOC creative teams for BIPOC audiences. Hollywood and Broadway must take accountability for their past casting failures and accordingly, prioritize implementing sustained institutional change and not temporary solutions.
No excuses should be tolerated; there is an abundance of BIPOC artists who are equally capable, skilled, and accomplished as their white colleagues who are able to claim BIPOC roles using their white privilege. Regardless of concerns surrounding profitability and international reception, the efforts to decolonize show business should not cease until at least half of the movies, television series, plays, and musicals released in a year feature BIPOC actors performing principal roles that realistically depict the full spectrum of experiences unique to their ethnic and racial communities.
As August Wilson declared in 1996, “We do not need colorblind casting." What American film, television, and theatre need instead is a wide-scale redistribution of space. For far too long, white narratives have crowded the pages of screenplays and scripts, leaving little room for the development of stories amplifying the voices of racial minorities. In most situations, BIPOC actors are haphazardly given the roles of token characters embodying harmful, inaccurate stereotypes. In the worst cases, their tales are invisible. They are completely erased from the homepages of streaming services, sheets of Playbills, and minds of too many consumers; the remaining eraser shavings symbolizing the last vestiges of hope for BIPOC artists. Hope, though, can be engendered once more. In order to do so, it is vital for the entertainment industry to make a commitment to upending casting procedures that submit to white supremacy and deprive BIPOC actors of opportunity and visibility.
So, what is the industry waiting for? Now more than ever, the screen and the stage must be spaces where a variance of races and ethnicities are not only acknowledged but also embraced. Manuel-Miranda, in spite of his missteps, recognized this and made a well-intentioned, bold attempt to rebel against white American theatre and reclaim and redefine theatre-making. It is time for others — in particular, white people belonging to the upper echelons of the film, theatre, and television world — to follow suit. It is only then that the cultural ground on which we stand will be encompassed by what Wilson wished upon his fellow Black artists 24 years ago: “angelic grace, peace, prosperity, and the unencumbered pursuit of happiness."

If you’re a fan of Disney and football, Disney+’s new film “Safety” might be the film for you. Directed by Reginald Hudlin, “Safety” is a lightly fictionalized adaptation of the life of Clemson University football player Ray McElrathbey. With McElrathbey being intimately involved with the production, audiences can expect that this movie will do justice to McElrathbey’s compelling story of overcoming adversity.
Amidst an empty football field and a sea of cheers, the narration of Clemson Coach Bowden (Matthew Glave) immediately sets the stakes for the trailer, as he asks: “What does sacrifice mean to you?” The trailer then transitions to fast-paced clips, accompanied by vibrant band music, of the team’s intensive training regimen. As a scholarship athlete, Ray (Jay Reeves) has the burden of balancing school and work; he trains day and night with his teammates while managing a full class load. His daily life, as the trailer demonstrates, is grueling. “If you don’t perform on the field and in the classroom,” Coach Bowden says to Ray, “it will all be taken away.”
The normalcy of Ray’s day-to-day schedule halts when he receives news that his 11-year-old brother Fahmarr (Thaddeus Mixon) will be placed in foster care. The trailer effectively changes the mood with this reveal, as the lighting dims and the music transitions to a dramatic, ticking ring. Pressed with a life-changing decision, Ray adopts his brother, thus having to balance his scholarship, football training, and secretly raising his brother on the Clemson campus.
The beauty of this trailer is that it encompasses the duality of Ray’s personal and professional life. The word “safety” acts as a double entendre: It connotes both the football position and the feeling itself, emphasizing not only the safety’s role as team support on the gridiron but also the support and comfort that we crave in our life. The trailer shifts from the relationship between blood-related brothers, Ray and Fahmarr, to the brotherhood that Ray receives from his teammates where “everyone is family.”
The last half of the trailer focuses on Ray’s evolution and the support he receives from those around him as he faces a series of challenges as an athlete, student, and brother. Vo Williams’ song “History in the Making” plays in the background, elevating the mood with motivating lyrics such as “we build bridges and break limits.” The scenes alternate between fictionalized behind-the-scenes moments in Ray's life and, interestingly, real footage of the team in action surrounded by actual Clemson fans — Director Hudlin shot the scenes during the halftime of a real Clemson game.
“Safety” may appear to follow a well-trodden formula similar to other football movie classics like “The Blind Side.” But it seems to be a promising film nonetheless, capturing the grit, glory, and teamwork that define the sport.

The Crimson has covered its fair share of quarantine pop culture: the “Twilight” renaissance, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez playing “Among Us” on Twitch, that week where everyone was literally just drawing and reposting fruit on their Instagram stories. If these trends have taught us anything, it’s that nobody can predict what will emerge from this creative crucible of quarantine. To quote a former arts chair, “Nietzsche was wrong. God is very much alive,” and 2020’s Twitter headlines are just His Mad Libs.
One of His preferred Mad Libs prompts, it seems, is Proper Noun: The Musical, which has spawned such classics as Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Musical and Grocery Store: The Musical. Both musicals came into being entirely on TikTok, with users taking advantage of the app’s duet feature to join in (Grocery Store: The Musical, for example, stars @another.blonde as “Mom,” @ireallylikemusica1s as “Employee,” and @igorandwheezy as “The Water Sprayers That Always Mist You When You’re Reaching for the Kale”). As viral as these two musicals became, neither could ever hope to match the size, scale, and dramaturgical depth of (what one can only assume is) 2020’s final TikTok musical creation — Ratatouille: The Musical.
Its origins can be traced back to Aug. 10, when @e_jaccs posted a TikTok of her singing “Ode to Remy,” an original ballad that, as of writing, only received 684k views (possibly as a result of it being tagged #ratatoille). On Oct. 19, however, @danieljmertzlufft (the creator of Grocery Store: The Musical) posted the ensemble cover of the original song, which has since garnered over 1.5 million views and become the anthem of the Ratatouille: The Musical movement.
In the ensuing weeks, theater TikTok was flooded with Ratatouille content. There were, of course, plenty of songs: Remy’s dad’s bouncy tango, “Trash Is Our Treasure”; Linguini’s tender ballad, “Anyone Can Cook”; and Anton Ego’s chilling solo, “Ratatouille” — just to name a few highlights. Actor Kevin Chamberlin (“Jessie”) and Jimmy Award winner Andrew B. Feldman ’25 (“Dear Evan Hansen”) have also pitched in, adding in two top-tier songs for Gusteau and Linguini, respectively.
But it didn’t just stop with songs. Like melodramatic, socially-awkward Avengers, the the theater kids of TikTok assembled in full force: sketching costumes, choreographing dance numbers, creating prototype sets, designing program covers — even building actual physical puppet costumes for Remy and Emile. I have never actually been at a pitch meeting for a real Broadway show, but I imagine this adds up to far more pre-development material than it took for, say, “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical” to be greenlit.
And just like an actual musical, Ratatouille seems to have amassed a fan following of its own. @rockysroad, for example, created a Lin-Manuel Miranda parody of Remy, replete with multisyllabic internal rhyme and a disconcertingly familiar goatee. Patton Oswalt, who played Remy in the original film, has been sporadically retweeting Ratatouille musical content, and the official DisneyParks TikTok account posted a video featuring Milo Manheim’s (“Zombies”) unofficial audition clip. Most recently, the official Pixar Instagram and Twitter accounts posted a picture of Remy with the caption, “The rat of all our dreams” — a reference, of course, to the line from “Ode to Remy,” the TikTok that started it all.
Quarantine has been a particularly dark time for theater kids. Broadway theaters are closed. High school and college musical productions have moved online or shut down entirely. The sacred dining rooms of Denny’s across the country have fallen silent — the giddy post-show gossip being relegated to Zoom rooms and FaceTimes, a poor substitute for the weird, sweaty energy of the time-honored theater kid tradition. It’s heartening, then, to see that the spirit of musical theater lives on; that the singers, actors, writers, choreographers, and designers are still out there, as talented as ever; and that not even a pandemic can stop this inexplicable, obsessive, wonderful thing that is Gen Z theater kid energy.

It is no secret that polarization has increased hostility and even altered perceptions of reality. A new study in Science shows that Democrats’ and Republicans’ antipathy for each other has even surpassed their support for those who vote the same way.
But perhaps certain factors make our country’s polarization appear worse than it is. It has been suggested, for example, that the “unusual bipartisanship” of the 1950s featured intra-party divisions similar to our inter-party divisions that make current times seem more heated. It also seems like politicians often make logical appeals to extremes, and that the highly partisan are often louder than the likely more moderate majority.
From a particular perspective, one that is perhaps increasingly widespread and no doubt seductive, it’s easy to feel like we are more different than we are alike. And over the course of this column, I’ve spent a lot of time examining such differences — from the divide between the sciences and humanities, between academia and the public, and between conviction and compromise.
Yet, despite examining so much that divides us, I actually find myself feeling more encouraged by what unites us — the shared journey of experimentation and collective-betterment that we continue to take up together.
There is an ocean between where we are and where we could be, and all humans are on the same side of that ocean. We share a foundation from the technology and knowledge of our past, and we approach the frontier of the unknown future together, striving to make that future better than today.
We are constantly exploring the bounds of our potential. The way I see it, humans transcended biological evolution the minute we donned furs as coats. Rather than wait for a mutation, we developed tools to defeat predators endowed with greater strength or speed. We did not wait to develop wings in order to fly. Making the impossible possible — whether planting the first seed, building metropolises, or inventing prosthetic limbs — is what ties all people together.
Of course, this is not to say that we should proceed without caution (we all know the Frankenstein’s monsters that can emerge from overeager science projects). Our current rate of technological development is unprecedented, and presumptuously plowing forward without deep moral examination will lead to unintentional consequences. Indeed, the political discourse — often heated and divisive — we have over hydraulic fracturing or genetic engineering is important. But it doesn’t show that we are living in different worlds with different realities to contend with; it shows that we are invested in the same problems and that we all care about the outcomes.
The problem then isn’t that we’re really opposed to one another but that we’ve allowed our tribalism to overwhelm our common cause. Take politics. It’s important to remember that when a person votes, they throw their support behind a series of stances that often don’t reflect their absolute positions — they could theoretically be 51 percent for the party of their choice. The Manichaean rhetoric between parties, then, usually doesn’t reflect the more nuanced and relative policy positions of individuals.
Indeed, during this pandemic, while we did not align as a country politically, we may have grown closer through common experience. In the short term, the pandemic can definitely exacerbate our differences; it would be naive to think otherwise. But the fact that scientists are inventing and testing vaccines at never-before-seen speed, and that the public, alongside experts, is evaluating which demographics deserve access first gives me hope. It’s not easy, but we’re ultimately establishing precedent-setting common ground. That’s how we move forward.
This semester, I was part of Professor David R. Armitage’s “Advice to Young Leaders” seminar. During our last class, we discussed a series of remarkable commencement addresses in Harvard history. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's, from May 2019, stood out. Merkel began by describing her life as a physicist at the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin: Every day, she’d walk along the unfeeling Berlin Wall to and from work. It literally stood in her way, concrete impenetrable.
But the Berlin Wall came down, and all kinds of hope and opportunities rose up.
“Nothing has to stay the way it is,” Merkel said. “Surprise yourself with what is possible.”
I think of those who walked across the Bering Strait, or launched into space, or captured wondrous phrases of the human experience. I think of the Da Vincis and Marie Curies and Barbara McClintocks of the world. And I think of everyone now just trying their best every day in virtual schools and hospitals and nursing homes.
Yes, we are polarized on many fronts. But our collective imagination and progress-seeking have the potential to mend those gaps. If history has taught us anything, it’s that we have incredible possibilities ahead of us — and I look forward to these endless surprises most beautiful.

“Harvard’s arts department [has] got no clout except for association with Harvard like please HRO sounds worse than my high school orchestra. if you were really that passionate about being an artist you would have went to a conservatory.” – Harvard Confession #3108
This anonymous opiner raised an argument we’ve all heard before: that student art is low-quality and that the arts departments (including Music, Art, Film, and Visual Studies, and Theater, Dance & Media) aren’t worthy of Harvard. Several of Harvard’s undergraduate music barons assembled in the comments to condemn this unfortunate post and offer their rebuttals. (Here are five quick counters.)
And their defense of HRO matters: while we can’t know the confessor’s motivations, picking out the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra is an affront to the performing arts at large. HRO stands for the whole, the way a football team might stand in for a school’s entire athletics program.
At Harvard, our musical standard-bearer suffers from an identity crisis: The Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra is an Undergraduate Council and alumni-funded student organization, a 2.0-credit class (Music 10a and Music 10b), and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit all at once. The HRO is also nominally North America’s oldest continuously-operating orchestra, though in its early years it took part in “serenading” more than any kind of serious musical study.
Harvard doesn’t operate a conservatory, and HRO is not a conservatory orchestra, and yet its steely culture at times imitates one. It’s taken for granted that Harvard’s orchestra should exist and put on four concerts a year, but for what? Even for its members, its mission is unclear.
What the HRO does not do is prepare students for careers in music. Few HRO members have plans to play professionally, and giving only two concerts per semester, its schedule would be too light to be an effective training program. Besides, like our disgruntled confessor said, if we had wanted that, we would have gone to a conservatory (although a few of us do).
But HRO is also not purely extracurricular. An HRO tenure signifies some above-average dedication to music, one that won’t disappear after the final concert of senior year; music will certainly play a lasting role in these students’ lives.
HRO instead teaches its musicians the value of live music. That might seem obvious, but as HRO members graduate and enter diverse fields of work, their tenures in HRO will lead them to become patrons of the arts, serving on boards of directors, donating to arts organizations, or simply buying tickets to concerts and shows. This class of supporters, i.e. former musicians, is crucial to the perpetuation of the industry. It makes up audiences in concert halls, consumers of commercial recordings, and classical music advocates out in the world.
Of course, HRO is not the only group that plays such a role on campus. All student music organizations have this same duty to turn their hundreds of members into music supporters. It’s their job to be fun for students, to generate lasting enthusiasm. This is true from the jazz program, to the Harvard Choruses, to the Harvard University Band, the Harvard Wind Ensemble, the Bach Society Orchestra, the Harvard College Opera, and so many more.
Being fun is an elusive ambition, one that happens more often by coincidence rather than by design. Fun in the Harvard Pops Orchestra (“Harvard’s Funniest Orchestra”) will be different from that in HRO (a strong contender for Harvard’s Least Funny Orchestra). HRO’s lack thereof is reflected in its class ratios: at the end of the 2019–2020 season, there were six seniors out of about 80 on the roster. Freshmen and sophomores usually make up the bulk of the group, a sign that HRO loses its appeal as students become upperclassmen. If we let musicians lose their faith, it’ll be a disservice to the future of classical music.
Musician enthusiasm at the college level almost certainly depends on two factors: repertoire choice and institutional support. For various reasons, HRO’s repertoire choices are influenced by considerations other than the will of the musicians. Unengaging music leads to absences, halfhearted commitment, and an enervated culture, and vice versa. To make matters worse, Harvard’s art establishments, including the Office for the Arts and the Music Department, take a relatively hands-off approach to orchestras; few from the outside advocate for HRO, leaving most up to the students themselves.
An orchestra as fine as Harvard’s shouldn’t be taken for granted. HRO at its best sounds like what it is — a group made up of conservatory-level players who happen to also have a penchant for academics. By performing — live or virtually — they serve as an example of what a great amateur orchestra can accomplish. And of course, great performances are the surest way to combat orchestra detractors.
HRO is in a lot of ways representative of the entire classical music industry — filled with extreme talent and potential that often gets, as some say, “no clout.” But attention is free to give. It’s on anyone who enjoys music to support the arts — at Harvard and elsewhere — by tuning them in, instead of tearing them down. Because if an orchestra plays in the forest, and no one is around to hear them, how will we really know they sound worse than your high school’s?

“Ew.” “I hate you.” “Shut up.” These are some of the heartfelt compliments my friends and I have paid each other recently, because we just love each other so much. While it may seem like we’re all just terrible people, our roasts and jibes are truly all out of love.
So if we love each other so much, why don’t we just say it? Why do we have to hide behind vomit emojis and unflattering imitations of each other? Why are we so mean?
Because love is embarrassing. Think of someone you hold dear in your heart. Imagine looking deep into their eyes and telling them completely genuinely that you love them and that they make your life better. Ugh. I don’t even like thinking about it. Now imagine sending them a video of a newborn foal falling over at 2 a.m. with the caption “haha it’s u u clumsy foo(a)l.” Better?
Of course that’s better! We are emotionally stunted, love-starved people. We never heard “I love you” enough as children and internalized that as a reflection of our own self-worth, or we were socialized into thinking any display of emotion is a display of weakness, or we grew up with a Hollywood conception of capital-L Love as too big for day-to-day life. Whatever the reason, we all feel love, this fondness and admiration for other people in our lives, but we can’t quite verbalize it without cringing.
On the flip side, others’ love is often too much of a burden to bear. How am I supposed to react if you tell me I’m a good person or that you like spending time with me? I don’t even think I’m a good person worth spending time with. But if you tell me I’m a blight on humanity and my brain cells are like lemmings leading each other off a cliff, we can have some good banter about which one of us is more trash.
Kindness is too nerve-wracking, and cordiality too impersonal. So all that’s left is to go in the opposite direction, into meanness, and hope that the other person picks up what we’re putting down. When we’re playfully mean to each other, what we’re really saying is: I love you. And I know you know it too. But because neither of us have the emotional capacity to acknowledge how much we mean to each other, I’m going to make fun of you. And you’ll know what I mean, because you’re just as messed up as me.
In this dynamic, making fun of your friends and getting made fun of in turn is actually the peak of friendship. You’re only mean to your friends after you pass the polite small talk phase and reach a deeper stage of friendship. I wouldn’t tell a new friend who made a minor mistake to “stop drinking stupid juice,” but I wouldn’t hesitate to say that to the friend who grew up with me and has known me for years. And there’s a difference between being called “bitch” by a hostile stranger on the street and being called “bitch” by your best friend. The meanness needs to be well-intentioned and balanced on both sides; otherwise, you’re just in an emotionally abusive relationship.
When you do know someone well enough, though, you’re not being mean to them for the sake of being mean, but to emphasize the underlying depths of your relationship that you can’t even begin to verbalize your appreciation for. When my girlfriend and I threaten to break up with each other over bad jokes, we’re really demonstrating the strength of our relationship, because obviously it’s going to take more than a handful of stupid puns to force us apart. We’re mean to each other because we know our relationship can take it.
In the majority of our lives, we’re nice people — we swear. But with our friends, we can be a little mean. We know we don’t intend to hurt each other, we know our friendship is stronger than any barb we can throw out, and we know we love each other. Being mean is just our emotionally stunted, love-starved way of showing it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The melodramatic goings-on of Harvard’s Undergraduate Council often elude the attention of their peers who are not as inclined to campus politics. Of the graduating classes in 2019 and 2020, 43 percent and 31 percent of seniors held no opinion of the former UC Presidents, as compared with 18 percent and 17 percent who had none of Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. This is understandable, as measures that go through Dean Khurana’s office, from the reversal of social club sanctions to spring plans for the College, have tangible, widely-felt impacts on student life. And while the UC may have some of the same potential, its reputation is trapped in a dysfunctional cycle of student disillusionment and detachment and UC infighting.
As they conclude their term, it’s worth reflecting on the tenure of outgoing UC president and vice-president James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma E. “Ify” White-Thorpe ’21. They entered office after a late surge helped on by a viral video and vague promises, and few details followed. This is perhaps the biggest problem for Harvard’s student government: it inspires the faith of only a few students (only a quarter of students voted in the latest UC election) and, in part as a result, only has the power to enact policies that bear on our lives tangentially, if at all. The cycle of disinterest and disempowerment is self-perpetuating. And though the UC website has a section for engagement, it presents itself more as an informational and resource guide than as a platform for genuine listening and interaction.
Despite these challenges, the UC has accomplished some useful things this year. Its low-cost winter and summer storage program was a major relief for some students, and its funding of Headspace subscriptions was a helpful albeit stopgap stand-in for mental health resources. As online classes continued this semester, the UC was vocal in supporting the extension of pass-fail grading, which was ultimately adopted by the College. Their decision to continue meeting into the summer deserves recognition as an admirable demonstration of commitment.
Perhaps most significantly, the UC also deserves credit for its involvement in advocacy: it signed onto an amicus brief supporting Harvard and MIT’s lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the summer. The UC took a proactive role in gathering student voices and using its platform to amplify them.
However good these efforts were, the impression that lasted was on balance negative. Looking back at the year, we remember the UC’s endorsement and later repudiation of “Double A” grading, its decision to disburse more than $2,000 for a club of a couple dozen members to buy Patagonia sweaters, and the overall lack of coordination between the council and its president and vice-president. At times like these, we wonder about the utility of our $200 Student Activities Fee. And in another classic reprisal, the UC continued its proud tradition of pursuing internal procedural reforms. The substantive effect of structural expansion instituted to the body’s caucus system remains to be seen.
These headlines grabbed and retained our attention because they justify our and many other students’ disillusionment and detachment from the UC. To change our assumptions the UC still has a lot of work to do.
But that work is not impossible, and we want to see them succeed. In the UC, we deserve a better advocate — one that can come up with thoughtful, targeted policy proposals and engage in sustained discussions, over years, if need be, with the University. Previous UC’s have risen to the task, and thanks to them, we do not have fall exams after winter break, rules about mixed-gender housing, and closed nights at Lamont.
The outgoing president and vice-president ran on the campaign slogan that “Harvard Can’t Wait.” It seems to us, however, that Harvard is still waiting for the advocate it needs.

When psychology concentrator Joyce D. Seok ’21 was designing her senior thesis last spring, she planned to invite research participants to her lab to examine changes in their cooperation after various synchronous activities, such as dancing.
In early March, Seok was told to start reimagining her project in the event that the pandemic would lead to restrictions on in-person research in the fall. After being sent home, however, she put her thesis planning on hold.
When it was announced that the fall semester would be held online, Seok struggled to decide whether to resume her studies. After she ultimately decided to enroll, she realized she faced an extra obstacle: conducting research for her senior thesis off campus.
Unable to meet with research subjects in person, she had to learn to code and create an online game in order to collect data for her project — using only her rudimentary knowledge from Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” a class she had taken in her freshman year at the College.
“So, a lot has changed,” Seok said.
For many Harvard students, engaging in research and writing a senior thesis is an essential part of their undergraduate education. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shift to remote learning, however, many seniors studying in the STEM fields — including Seok — have had to redesign their thesis projects.
For Mechanical Engineering concentrator Joseph M. Sanchez ’21, online learning meant he had to change the methods of his thesis experiments — conducting simulations and using computational models rather than making physical prototypes.
This is a common theme among most engineering students, according to Chris J. Lombardo, associate director of undergraduate studies in the School of Engineering of Applied Sciences.
Without access to Harvard facilities and active learning labs this semester, Lombardo noted that normal physical design and prototyping is “just not possible.”
“Typically students were involved in building something. Now, clearly, it is more difficult to build if you don’t have a lab. So it’s mostly focused on the design,” added applied mechanics professor Katia Bertoldi.
On a similar note, typical senior theses in biology would normally involve in-person, experimental wet lab work or field work. Given lab restrictions, however, many biology departments have decided to expand the types of senior thesis projects they will accept.
“We decided as a department to broaden our scope and try to work with undergraduates to help them come up with projects — that we probably wouldn’t have otherwise done as senior honors theses — that would be library-based or meta analyses or based on data that’s already been collected,” said Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, biology professor and co-director of undergraduate studies for the Human Evolutionary Biology department.
The Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology and Integrative Biology concentrations decided to allow postdoctoral or graduate students to finish up in-person lab and field work for some undergraduates who were unable to complete their projects but could analyze data from home.
According to William J. Anderson, the director of undergraduate studies for HDRB, the department will also allow projects to focus primarily on data analysis and literature review.
Given the challenges of working in a lab this semester, some students have decided to take time off from school before continuing with their thesis work.
Integrative Biology concentrator Logan T. Qualls ’22-’23 had planned to start his thesis research this summer in his lab. Instead of adapting his thesis topic to fit an online format, he decided to take a gap year.
Qualls said that he still plans to write a thesis in the future, but noted that the shift in schedule caused a “little bit of stress” about the available time he would have for data collection.
Graham L. Friedman ’21-’22, another Integrative Biology concentrator, also decided to take a gap year.
“It’s kind of unclear what my thesis plans are exactly at this point — they were more clear before COVID [and] I felt like I had a direction,” Friedman said.
Many of those who decided to continue with their theses said that the online format has not only affected their projects, but also their motivation levels.
Integrative Biology concentrator Ella T. Frigyik ’21 said she felt more burnout than usual this year.
“Continuing to try and function normally and to push out high quality academic work in a time of a global pandemic, in a massively politically tumultuous time — it’s been quite difficult,” she said.
Seok added that much of her stress comes from having to acknowledge that some challenges cannot be resolved.
“It is very clear from what we speak about at our tutorial meetings with the group that everyone is undoubtedly feeling stressed; everyone undoubtedly feels out of control of their situation,” she said.
Astrophysics concentrator Devin M. Sullivan ’21 said that communicating virtually with advisors and with other thesis writers in the concentration has also been challenging.
“It’s certainly a challenge not having access to be able to drop in on my advisor at unexpected times or even be able to organically interact with my classmates to talk about the writing process and some of the code that we’re working on,” he said.
Frigyik added that communication with lab members has become a lot less spontaneous.
On campus, there were “always people in the lab and I can always ask someone, ‘Oh, where’s this found?’ or ‘What does this step mean?’” she said. “Doing things remotely, I think I’m a lot more tempted to just try and figure things out by myself, because there’s that added barrier of writing an email to someone to ask for help.”
Even seniors that have been granted permission to conduct in-person research for their theses report similar communication problems posed by COVID-19 restrictions in laboratories.
One of those guidelines, according to Neuroscience concentrator Isabella R. Beckett ’21, is that only a limited number of people can be in the lab space at one time.
Elida Kocharian ’21, a joint concentrator in Earth and Planetary Sciences and Environmental Science and Engineering, noted that this means that lab members are restricted in the amount of time they can spend collecting data.
“I seriously had to cut down and find a minimalist way to do everything that I needed to do and to get enough data to write a thesis,” Kocharian said. “But to be honest, I’m just glad that I got to do stuff in the lab at all.”
Beckett added that labs are not meant to be independent work spaces.
“I think something that’s really inefficient is the idea of sharing space, because labs aren’t meant to have only one person doing work at a time. There are multiple benches and bays for a reason,” she said.
Despite the number of hurdles preventing spontaneous communication between lab members, faculty in all departments have been working to support students as they adapt to sudden changes.
Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology Rachelle Gaudet said that the MCB and Chemistry and Physical Biology departments started having group meetings over the summer where students would take turns presenting their projects.
“At first, I think the students were like, ‘Do we really have to do this?’” Gaudet said. “But then I think they really enjoyed it and ended up connecting much more with their classmates over the research that they’re doing.”
Many students have acknowledged the particularly accommodating and flexible nature of various departments and advisors this semester.
Even though concentrations that are mainly quantitative — specifically Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Physics, Astrophysics, and Computer Science — were not as severely affected by the restrictions, they still applied minor changes to grading policies in regards to concentration and honors requirements to help support students.
“Interaction with research advisors is, of course, harder,” Computer Science Professor Stephen N. Chong wrote in an email. “But we are fortunate that most research in Computer Science has been able to continue without access to the physical labs or equipment.”
In addition to academic support, many students said departments and research advisors have been diligent with checking in on students and providing emotional support throughout the thesis process.
“I think naturally for everyone, given the online format, motivation will sort of hit in waves,” MCB concentrator Dhweeja Dasarathy ’21 wrote in an email. “However, the MCB department, as well as my lab, has really worked to provide me with deadlines which has helped a lot with motivations.”
Dasarathy added that weekly individual advising meetings helped her manage her stress levels and use her time more efficiently.
The Psychology department has also worked to encourage seniors working on thesis projects. Seok met with her senior tutorial advisor and other seniors working on their theses every Tuesday this semester.
“It is actually so helpful to know that you are not the only one struggling and you are not the only one feeling inadequate or feeling rushed or feeling kind of helpless because of elements that are out of your control,” Seok said.
“I’m just super thankful to my adviser David Wilner who is just incredibly supportive and understands that it’s a stressful time. [He’s] not just a research advisor in the strictest sense but he’s also always ready to listen to problems that I have with motivation or frustrations,” Sullivan added of the Astrophysics department.
Sullivan also highlighted how remote thesis work has provided him with time management tools he envisions himself using in future endeavors.
“You spend a lot of time self-pacing and self-motivating which has been, I think, good, and is definitely a skill that I will benefit from going forward, hopefully, pursuing more research in the future,” he said.
While the global pandemic has greatly shifted the dynamics of writing senior theses in STEM concentrations this semester, faculty and students said these experiences have simultaneously promoted innovation and growth in students and faculty.
“The process of having to shift remote has sort of spurred creativity and innovation in many different spheres in terms of how we teach things that will probably stick around even when we’re back,” Gaudet said.
“I think it’s made a lot of scientists more creative because you’re not just going to stop doing your science,” Kocharian echoed. “You have to find ways to move forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In-person tutorials, café study sessions, and nights out at pubs — the coronavirus era has not precluded Harvard students enrolled at the University of Oxford from enjoying a somewhat normal fall term.
In July 2020, Harvard College announced that it would allow international undergraduates to pursue a study away option at home universities and colleges. College students living abroad would be able to enroll and transfer credits from accredited programs in their home countries.
As of December 2020, 14 international students were pursuing the study away option, with 13 enrolling at Oxford in the United Kingdom and one at Tsinghua University in China.
Many of the students who ultimately decided to enroll at a school abroad did so expecting that it would lead to in-person classes and a sense of normalcy.
For Angela C. Eichhorst ’22, the time spent away from Cambridge has been a “really positive experience.”
“I mean obviously, I do miss Harvard, but I guess, like, going to a different schooling system has allowed me, I think, to learn different things or learn at a different pace,” Eichhorst, a Crimson magazine editor, said. “The buildings are beautiful, I’ve been able to study in libraries which has been really fun, in the beginning, going to cafes, but later going on a lot of walks around the area with friends.”
Earlier in the year, students reported that the process of enrolling at Oxford was relatively quick, as Harvard has sent in a number of visiting students to Oxford over the years, facilitating easy communication between the two institutions.
The relationship between the universities also meant enrolled students could more clearly plan out their courses of study for the academic year. Simeon J. A. Sayer ’23, a Computer Science concentrator, said he was largely treated as if he were an Oxford student. Since Sayer had already left his first year at Harvard with a concentration in mind, it was easy for him to cross-validate his course of study with faculty at both universities.
“I’m really linked to my department. So I’m more or less being treated directly as an Oxford student,” Sayer said. “So I have all the facilities of an Oxford computer science student, whether that's access to career fairs, or that's, you know, library access, or access to online resources, or lab materials for class.”
In-person instruction from faculty was another plus factor which Harvard students say has provided a welcome break from remote learning.
Lauren V. Marshall ’22, a Crimson Arts editor, said she has really enjoyed being face to face with her instructors.
“So all of my tutorials were one-on-one,” Marshall said. “My tutors themselves were really great, and because it’s so intimate you kind of instinctually get, I guess, more support or understanding.”
The United Kingdom instituted a four-week national lockdown from Nov. 5 to Dec. 2 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The nations asked restaurants, gyms, and non-essential shops asked to close; schools and universities, however, could remain open, allowing students to continue meeting face to face with faculty and peers.
The University of Oxford has 45 colleges, each of which independently maintains its own operations, libraries, and academic and administrative staff, as well as accommodations, meals, activities, and events. To control the spread of COVID-19, Oxford administrators restricted student life to interactions within colleges, with some enforcing more stringent virus prevention guidelines than others.
Ultimately, despite positive feedback from Harvard students, many still lamented the circumstances which brought them to the United Kingdom and the rising tide of COVID-19 cases which has disrupted the semi-normal social life students enjoyed.
“I think that study away hasn’t been easy for anyone. Speaking to other Harvard students, it’s quite a shock to suddenly have that disruption and not be where you thought you would be,” Marshall said. “I think that I speak for a lot of us when I say that we feel very lucky to have this opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two members of Harvard’s Class of 2021— and one member of the Class of 2019 — were named winners of the 2021 Marshall Scholarship on Monday.
Humza I. Jilani ’21, Jorge A. Ledesma ’19, and Evelyn Wong ’21 are among the 46 American students selected for the scholarship, which covers the cost of any graduate-level education at any British institution. The news comes a year after no Harvard affiliates were selected for the prestigious program.
This year’s scholarship class is the first to be majority-minority, with 52 percent of the scholars coming from minority backgrounds, according to a press release.
Jilani, a Social Studies concentrator in Winthrop House, said he learned he had won the scholarship in his off-campus apartment while surrounded by his roommates.
“I was just sitting in my room incidentally kind of moping because I didn’t know if I had done particularly well in the interview,” Jilani said. “It was pretty surreal, just sitting in my room, and then I kind of came outside and did a little happy dance with my roommates.”
Jilani said he plans to use the scholarship to pursue a Master of Philosophy in Politics at Oxford University, where he will study the internet’s effect on democracies.
“What I’m really hoping to focus on is the ways that the internet and social media today are a divisive force, both in the U.S. and abroad,” Jilani said. “Can we create narratives that are a bit more inclusive online that we can use to actually be a force to fulfill the real promise of a vibrant and inclusive democracy, as opposed to using the internet as a tool for authoritarians?”
Wong, a Quincy House resident pursuing a joint concentration in Neuroscience and Romance Languages and Literature, plans to earn a Doctor of Philosophy in Neuroscience at University College London and work at the intersection of science and refugee health.
“I owe all of this to the countless professors and friends and mentors and parents who have helped me grow along the way — whether it was buying basketball shoes so I could play on a team or offering a couch to crash on,” Wong said. “I’m really grateful and humbled to have this opportunity, but at the end of the day, I really want to be that someone for someone else.”
Wong, one of six first-generation college students awarded the Marshall Scholarship, said she was drawn to UCL — and the Marshall — because of UCL neuroscientist Michael Hausser’s research. Wong plans to work with Hausser over the course of her studies.
“I like his philosophy of research, which is that the question that you ask about science shouldn’t be limited to the technologies that are available to you,” Wong said. “He’s this leading pioneer in neural technology, and I wanted to work with him to create tools for better understanding behavior because there’s a lot that we don’t know about the brain.”
Ledesma, who graduated with a concentration in Social Studies from Currier House, said he has spent his time after graduation working in the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office. His work has focused on the intersection of disability and accessibility — issues he said have been exacerbated both by the COVID-19 pandemic and racial tensions.
At Oxford, Ledesma plans to pursue two Master of Science degrees: one in Comparative Social Policy and one in Evidence-Based Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation. He said he was drawn to studying in the United Kingdom after he recognized similarities in social policy — particularly around people of color — between America and Britain.
“What I want to do is[…] really build that toolkit of alternatives and policy solutions that are globally informed, accessible, and can be implemented here in the U.S. and in Suffolk County and Boston specifically,” Ledesma said.
As a Marshall Scholar, Ledesma said he hopes to immerse himself in the culture of the United Kingdom and understand diverse points of view.
“I’ve had very particular experiences growing up as an immigrant in the U.S., and I want to see how other people live: to just be able to break bread and enjoy my time," he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students begin the semesterly ritual of filling out online course evaluations, some undergraduates expressed frustration that some professors did not give the option to make qualitative comments for future students to read.
Harvard’s Office of Undergraduate Education concluded a transition to a new vendor-managed version of the Q Guide — the College’s course evaluation platform — in February, moving away from the “home-grown” system it developed in 2004 and 2005.
Under the old system, professors could choose whether or not to publicly display student responses to the question, “What would you like future students to know about this course?” Now, if professors indicate they do not intend to publicly display those responses, the Q Guide does not pose the question to students at all.
In response to the question’s disappearance, undergraduates took to social media to criticize the change, noting that many faculty appear to have elected not to display qualitative feedback. Several argued the rocky nature of online learning makes communicating with future enrollees more — not less — critical.
One student, Jasmine L. Huang ’22, even took it upon herself to consolidate student feedback, soliciting responses to the “What would you like to tell future students about this class?” question. Huang and others circulated an anonymous survey posing the question across House email lists with the goal of posting results on a public webpage.
Kendrick Foster ’22 said none of the course evaluations for his five classes this semester featured the option to provide qualitative comments.
“From a transparency perspective, you’re saying there’s something about this class that we wish that students in future years didn’t know,” Foster said. “It’s saying we want to hide something about our class to future students. I don’t think it sends a very good message.”
Foster said he thinks submitting feedback on the Q Guide for courses this semester is crucial.
“A qualitative evaluation allows us to tell between professors that have been supportive, and the professors that haven’t been supportive,” he said. “We won’t know what classes adopted new and revolutionary teaching methods and those that just stuck with time honored or time worn teaching practices.”
Malika M. Umar ’22 also said she thinks professors should not be able to deny students the opportunity to engage with prospective enrollees through public comments.
“If we leave it in the hands of the professors, then they’re the ones who are controlling the narrative, not the students — and the students are the ones who are supposed to be taking the class,” she said.
“I think that students want to share the good and bad about the classes they’ve taken and steer future students clear of something that may have been a bad experience for them,” she continued.
Umar added that the apparent change also renders students unable to leave positive comments and encourage students to take a given course.
“I would love the chance to be able to tell future students, ‘Hey, these are some things that I really liked about the class,’” she said. “I would love to be able to tell students, ‘Hey, I really loved X professor, because they were really gracious with grading or they were really flexible and really lenient when it came to extensions.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the question’s absence for many courses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand and Harvard College parent Jie “Jack” Zhao have been indicted on bribery charges by a federal grand jury, the Justice Department announced in a press release Monday.
Federal authorities arrested Brand and Zhao in December, alleging they conspired to “facilitate” the admission of Zhao’s two sons to Harvard in exchange for bribes totaling over $1.5 million. The University dismissed Brand in July 2019 for violating its conflict of interest policy after Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay launched an investigation into Brand in April 2019.
The FAS investigation came after The Boston Globe reported Brand sold his Needham home to Zhao — a Maryland resident and parent of one then-current Harvard fencer and one former Harvard fencer — for hundreds of thousands of dollars above its market value. In addition to purchasing Brand’s residence, Zhao allegedly paid for Brand’s car, made college tuition payments for Brand’s son, and paid the mortgage on Brand’s home, according to the Justice Department’s press release.
The grand jury indicted Brand and Zhao on one count of conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, as well as one count of federal programs bribery, per the press release.
Douglas S. Brooks, Brand’s attorney, declined to comment on the indictment. He previously wrote to The Crimson that Brand did not break the law.
“The students were academic and fencing stars,” Brooks wrote in November. “Coach Brand did nothing wrong in connection with their admission to Harvard. He looks forward to the truth coming out in court.”
Zhao’s attorney, William Weinreb, separately declined to comment on the indictment. He previously wrote to The Crimson that Zhao will fight the charges in court.
“Jack Zhao’s children were academic stars in high school and internationally competitive fencers who obtained admission to Harvard on their own merit,” he wrote in November. “Both of them fenced for Harvard at the Division One level throughout their college careers. Mr. Zhao adamantly denies these charges and will vigorously contest them in court.”
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the indictment.

Despite calls for change, University President Lawrence S. Bacow doubled down on the University’s decision to stop compensating the majority of idled contract workers after Jan. 15 in an interview with The Crimson on Thursday.
Since March, the University has sustained regular salaries for all direct staff and most contract workers whose work was eliminated by the pandemic. Come mid-January, though, the University plans to reduce pay for direct staff and eliminate pay for most contract workers.
Bacow said that the University strives to be “generous and supportive” of all its employees.
“We have literally thousands of people that we’ve been paying full time who have had no work since March. And we’ve tried to do as much as we can,” he said. “But we also have responsibilities to students and faculty and staff, and we have to prioritize the academic enterprise as well.”
In a Nov. 12 announcement, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp cited financial challenges as the reason for the change. On top of decreased revenues, both Lapp and Bacow noted that the University anticipates some increased expenses, like financial aid.
“We know that there are going to be students — we’ve already received requests — with much greater demand for financial aid because their parents have no work at this point,” Bacow said. “Candidly, we have to prioritize that over contract workers who are not our employees.”
Bacow also said that the indefinite nature of the pandemic complicates the University’s financial decision-making.
“There are limits to how much we can do and we don’t know how long this is going to last,” he said. “What we can’t afford is to compromise the academic mission of the institution, given that we have extraordinary demands on the University to support students, and others as well.”
Roxana Rivera — the vice president of the Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ — wrote in an emailed statement that the union is “shocked and disappointed” by the University’s choice to modify its emergency excused absence policy.
32BJ SEIU represents approximately 1,000 custodians and security officers at Harvard. Roughly 400 custodians are directly employed, while another 300 are contracted — as are all security officers, who work directly for Securitas.
“While Harvard’s financials are no doubt affected by the pandemic, they remain the University with the largest endowment of any higher education institution in the world,” Rivera wrote. “They can afford to continue to take care of these contracted workers.”
“When the dust has settled and this pandemic is over, Harvard will recover, but if these custodians and security officers lose their jobs, they may never catch up,” she added.
In November, 32BJ held rallies calling on the University to guarantee it will not lay off contracted workers in the spring. More than 1,100 affiliates also signed a petition demanding the University extend the same protections to contracted workers and directly employed staff.
In the interview, Bacow noted that Harvard contracts with a variety of workers whose services are not needed year-round.
“The University contracts with all sorts of folks,” he said. “We contract with different employers to provide services to us, usually because we often have seasonal needs for workers, and so we don’t employ them year round.”
“I would also point out that we are encouraging these people to look to their own employers for support, not just to Harvard,” he added.
Rivera wrote that the administration is acting “disingenuous in emphasizing the contracted nature of these jobs.”
“These are not gig workers who do the occasional job for Harvard,” she wrote. “These are dedicated and vital members of the Harvard community who have been at the frontlines of keeping campus clean, safe, and healthy throughout this crisis alongside their directly-employed colleagues.”

Harvard Summer School will hold all 2021 courses online because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it announced last week.
The Summer School offers college and high-school level courses each summer on Harvard’s campus. Last summer, it also moved all courses online and canceled on-campus programming in response to the pandemic.
While the Summer School has yet to announce whether adult and college students will be permitted to live in Harvard dorms while taking virtual classes next summer, a note on its website states that high school students will be barred from on-campus housing.
The decision came after University administrators announced last week that Harvard College will invite roughly 3,100 students to live on campus next semester, giving priority to seniors and currently enrolled juniors. Students spending the entire 2020-2021 academic year off campus — including most sophomores — will be provided a tuition waiver for up to two Summer School courses next year, and students on financial aid will be eligible for “subsidized” room and board, according to the announcement.
Jaden D. “JD” Deal ’23, who plans to take advantage of his two free summer classes, said he “pretty much expected” the Summer School’s move to a virtual format.
“I didn’t really have high hopes that we would even be invited to return to campus for the summer,” he said. “With HSS being online, it doesn’t really affect my plans because, if these semesters are going to be online, what’s the difference?”
Ishan A. Bhatt ’23 wrote that he is undecided about his summer 2021 plans, but is skeptical about returning to online classes. He wrote that he and other sophomores are “suffering through two semesters of a draining zoom U” and are being rewarded “with another semester of zoom U.”
Deal said he thinks sophomores should take precedence in Summer School housing if a residential program is ultimately approved.
“If they’re going to prioritize seniors and juniors and allow more students to come back in the spring semester, sophomores got left out of every proposal for fall and spring,” he said. “It would only make sense to invite us back for the summer, especially if vaccinations are already underway.”

A Harvard Graduate School of Education team completed a report to the Committee on Student Life examining Harvard’s comps, which recommended that student organizations increase the transparency of the processes by which they admit new members.
Over the past month, a team of graduate students led by HGSE Professor Richard J. Light compiled research on student, faculty, and staff perceptions of “comps,” the procedures required for membership in many student organizations at the College. Students and administrators have long debated whether the College needs more sweeping comp reform, citing their sometimes-exclusive nature. The processes can range from brief auditions to semester-long ordeals.
The CSL — an advisory body comprised of Harvard administrators, faculty deans, house committee chairs, and Undergraduate Council representatives — first discussed the review in October. In the CSL’s Dec. 4 meeting, the HGSE team conveyed 14 recommendations to the committee, each of which fell into one of the following categories: “Inclusion And Belonging,” “Campus Collaboration,” “Clear, Transparent Communication,” and “Continuous Learning and Improvement.”
The group collected data for the study via dozens of student survey responses and interviews, including both current students and alumni. They also culled opinions from administrators, faculty, and staff, and looked at student organization culture at peer institutions across the country.
According to the report, 52 percent of recognized undergraduate student organizations conduct some form of comp, which the HGSE team defined as having “at least 1 membership requirement.” While most surveyed students were “satisfied” with the comp process, the research group found that 65 percent of students “do not feel that the comping process is clear,” and 68 percent feel “the comping process is a time burden.”
The report made recommendations aimed at both organizations and administrators. On the administrative side, the report suggested staff training on how to better inform freshmen about the nature of comping, as well as asking the DSO to offer implicit bias training.
Some interviewees also reported that the comp process “impedes'' student engagement and creates a “time burden” for students.
In response to those concerns, the HGSE group recommended that organizations develop “tiered” membership structures. They also proposed a rolling comp timeline to help alleviate time pressures.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Assistant Dean Kate T. Colleran said during the meeting that they were impressed by the report’s thoroughness. O’Dair wrote in an email that she was surprised by the range of comping formats the study uncovered, but was concerned how negative aspects of some comps — particularly a lack of transparency — affect students looking to find a place at the College.
“Unsurprisingly, the problems seem to emerge when students see processes as opaque and exclusionary with no real set of criteria for what is required for membership,” she wrote. “Students, particularly first year students, often want to try a new skill or interest area and are looking for that opportunity.”
The DSO will work with the Undergraduate Council, student organization leaders, and the CSL to consider how to put the recommendations into practice, O’Dair added. On the DSO’s part, that work could take the form of the suggested bias training or providing information for individual organizations, but that reform will likely hinge upon student action, she wrote.
“Many of the recommendations will rely on the student organizations themselves to implement, but we will do all we can to act on these,” O'Dair wrote.
The Dec. 4 meeting also marked the first involvement of the new UC president and vice president, Noah A. Harris ’22 and Jenny Y. Gan ’22, who now will become sitting members of the committee. Harris and Gan were officially sworn in to their new roles on the UC Sunday.
Harris said he hopes the UC can collaborate with student organizations to implement changes and serve as a resource in changing the comp culture on campus.
Several comp recommendations advised both the DSO and student groups to increase communication around comps, especially to freshmen. Gan said the UC will work with student organizations, as well as within its caucus system, to examine some of the recommendations.
“I think that part of the reason why comps are unknowable is there isn’t a lot of communication around them,” she said. “There are reasons why there are comps, and it’s a problem when it becomes a time burden, or when it disadvantages students from different groups.”
Harris also said the process of reforming comps will last past their departure from the UC.
“If we are able to build those long term channels, even if we can’t completely change the culture during our one year, we know that three, four years down the line, our work will have been the first step to something bigger,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Developers presented plans for a mixed-use building in Allston at a Monday meeting with the Harvard-Allston Task Force and Impact Advisory Group.
The seven-story building, which will be known as Barry’s Corner Residential and constructed at 180 Western Ave., will house restaurants, retail spaces, and 270 residential units.
Allston residents and Harvard affiliates sit on the task force, which advises on Harvard’s developments in Allston in addition to the 180 Western Ave. project. The body works with the Boston Planning and Development Agency and Impact Advisory Group to analyze the effects of development on the neighborhood.
At Monday’s meeting, David P. Manfredi, CEO and founding principal of Elkus Manfredi Architects, presented the project’s main goals — placemaking and public realm, inclusivity, and sustainability and resilience.
“Barry’s Corner is the center. It’s not the rest of Western Ave. or the rest of North Harvard Street; it is this walkable center,” Manfredi said. “We want to create a sense of inclusivity that provides new housing types, as well as small-scale retail.”
“We believe that a big part of sustainability is, in fact, economic, and that is about creating retail as a community amenity, designing for health and well-being,” he also said.
Manfredi also cited the project’s adherence to the Boston Compact Living Pilot, which he said supports affordability and sustainability.
The City of Boston outlines several requirements for compact living through the pilot. They include “well-designed units with storage and natural light, shared common areas, and transportation options that reduce car use,” per a city government website.
Manfredi told meeting attendees that the project will promote “green space” and open space for the public. To that end, the construction will increase the number of trees lining the streets to 23, reduce curb cuts, increase sidewalk square footage, and designate more space for outdoor dining. The proposal would also designate spaces for parked cars and bikes for housing unit residents.
Julia Wynyard, vice president of Samuels and Associates — the developer responsible for the proposal — divulged rental prices for different units in the building at the meeting. Studios will start at least $2,200 per month, she said, while three-bedroom units will fetch a monthly rate of $4,500 and upwards.
Some task force members responded to Wynyard’s proposal with concerns regarding the affordability of the residential spaces.
“The affordability issue is very personal with me,” said Anthony P. D’Isidoro, an Allston resident and president of the Allston Civic Association. “I can’t stand when I have especially young people coming up to me and saying their goodbyes to me because they can’t afford to live in Allston-Brighton anymore.”
Others attendees questioned the prudence of opening a retail center during the pandemic-induced recession.
“There are quite a few either empty retail spaces or places that have had to close down because of COVID whether that’s temporary or even permanent,” Christine Varriale, a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said. “There’s still an empty retail space on the corner of Continuum that has never had anything in it in the five years that the building has been opened. There’s empty spaces at Charles View.”
Varriale suggested reducing the cost of rent in the building to incentivize stores to move to Allston.
D’Isidoro told The Crimson after the meeting that there is demand for small businesses within the neighborhood.
“The retail thing is really picking up,” he said. “That’s coming from the fact that more and more people in the community [want] to have a vibrant retail experience.”
Wynyard said though it is still early to engage retailers, her team is considering how to attract businesses that are local or “starting out.”
In an emailed statement, Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote the proposed project will make “significant contributions” to the neighborhood. She added that the University will continue to engage with developers, the task force, and Allston residents as the project moves forward.
Correction: December 9, 2020
A previous version of this article misspelled Julia Wynyard's surname.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Alliance Against Campus Cops called for the abolition of the Harvard University Police Department and presented a report on the police force’s history and procedures in a remote event Tuesday.
The group of students and alumni, which formed this summer in the wake of the murders of George Floyd and other Black people by law enforcement officers, released a 143-page report over the weekend entitled “Harvard’s Finest?: The Case for the Abolition of the Harvard University Police Department.” The report, which group members spent five months researching and producing, cites Crimson articles, archival material, and HUPD police logs.
During the event, HAACC member Ifeoluwani “Ife” E. Omidiran ’22 alleged HUPD is a “force of violence against Black people, people of color, and poor people.”
Omidiran, who is a Crimson Arts editor, referenced HUPD officer Anthony T. Carvello’s alleged use of excessive force while arresting Black homeless men during the 2019-2020 academic year; HUPD’s ties to the Cambridge Police Department, which came under fire in 2018 following CPD’s controversial arrest of a black College student; and the police department’s frequent issuing of trespass warrants to individuals deemed “unwanted” on University property.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain noted an ongoing independent review of HUPD is assessing the department’s policing practices and its collaboration with local law enforcement agencies.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced the review in June after the presence of HUPD officers monitoring a Black Lives Matter protest in Boston incited condemnation from students and faculty alike.
Per Swain, the review will be published “in the coming weeks,” and will “serve as a roadmap for reimagining public safety within the Harvard community.”
In its report, HAACC set forth a seven-point list of demands it believes will set in motion the abolition of HUPD. Those include cutting the department’s budget by 80 percent, ending HUPD’s contracts with local law enforcement agencies — including CPD, Boston Police, and Massachusetts State Police — disarming HUPD, and subjecting HUPD, which is a private police force, to public records requests.
HAACC wrote in its report that it examined 11,000 HUPD police logs the department published between 2015 and 2020. According to the group’s analysis of those logs, HUPD officers most frequently deal with reports of theft, followed by reports of suspicious activity, reports of unwanted guests, and calls to assist Cambridge Police.
The group charged that incidents involving “suspicious activity” correlated with individuals experiencing mental illness, emotional distress, poverty, or houselessness.
“Within the ‘suspicious activity’ category, as well, are incidents that suggest mental illness or emotional distress (e.g., ‘Officers dispatched to a report of an individual screaming and throwing clothes in the area. Officers arrived and report individual gone on arrival’) or poverty (e.g., ‘Officers dispatched to a report of two individuals searching through recycling bins behind the building. Officers arrived and reported individuals gone on arrival’),” the report states.
Of the people HUPD arrested within that span of five years, the group found that 29.3 percent were experiencing housing insecurity and 35 percent were arrested for “trespassing.”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.
In an interview with The Crimson after the event, HAACC representative and Harvard Law School student Marina L. Multhaup said abolishing HUPD is a matter of “safety.”
“We made this report as an attempt to sort of really shed light on what HUPD does, which in our findings mainly came out to being a glorified insurance agency for Harvard students when things go missing and then to enact violence and sort of surveillance on Harvard students of color, maybe in general, but particularly Black and young community members and members who are experiencing houselessness,” she said.
“So then the question becomes, ‘what would make us safe, actually?’” Multhaup also said. “And we think that building up institutions and networks that actually address the root causes of harm and harms that arise is a different type of safety, one where needs are met rather than punished.”
Event organizers called for greater “transparency” especially in regards to the department’s finances, which Harvard does not divulge.
The report cites the most recent HUPD operating budget that Harvard published, which was $12,560,585 in 2011.
The HAACC report calls on the University to redistribute HUPD’s budget — which the group estimates is currently roughly $20 million — to other Harvard-related causes, such as purchasing personal protective equipment for all Harvard workers, expanding student and mental health services, and growing the financial aid program.
Swain, the Harvard spokesperson, declined to comment on whether HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley or University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp — who oversees the department — are aware of HAACC’s report.

This reading period, you may have fewer (as in, zero) formals and gatherings to attend, so what should you do with the extra few hours? Make your life a little sweeter by eating delicious goodies. Rather than simply scrolling through Pinterest and saving photos of aesthetic holiday desserts, go out and actually enjoy a few treats from this list. This semester may not have been a piece of cake, but you certainly deserve one for making it to the end.
Apple Cider Donuts
Your class year may not be the apple of Harvard’s eye for Spring 2021, but these donuts are definitely ours. Filled with cinnamon and sugar, apple cider donuts embody warm fireplaces, cozy socks, and cute Gossip Girl-style coats. This dessert is far from your basic Krispy Kreme glazed donut, and it is a cold weather staple, especially if you’re feeling nostalgic for the apple-picking season in New England. Enjoy a donut with a glass of milk, a mug of coffee, or even a cup of apple cider.
Jam Thumbprint Cookies
Sad that you won’t be able to leave your mark on campus this year? Leave it on a cookie instead! Jam thumbprint cookies are small, adorable treats with a tasty surprise in the middle. If you’re up for a challenge and looking for a tasty study break, try to bake them yourself with this recipe. Fill the little crater with apricot, strawberry, or blueberry preserves. If none of those options are your jam, try something unique, such as a Hershey Kiss, peanut butter, or leftover Halloween candy — with final exams around the corner, it’s safe to say that our lives are still pretty spooky anyway.
Custard Pies
Due to their popularity during the flapper era, custard pies were featured in Season 7, Episode 5: “Roaring ‘20s Week” of the Great British Baking Show. This semester was far from easy as pie, but this yellow baked good will help you forget all of your woes by bringing you back to the age of jazz, the Charleston, and feather headbands. The baking show’s white tent also bears a striking resemblance to the plaza tent in front of Harvard’s Science Center, which hurts a bit, but the sweet filling makes up for the painful reminder.
Tiramisu
How can you resist a cake that tastes like coffee, that’s a favorite during the holiday season, and whose meaning in Italian is “pick me up?” You can’t! A delicious HUDS specialty, tiramisu is bound to make you reminisce about the good ol’ days on campus. We can’t count the number of times we went back for seconds of this dessert in the dining hall, whether it was over a meal with friends or as comfort food on a stressful night. Bring a slice of Harvard to your home by treating yourself to some savory tiramisu. Harvard tira-misses-you too, boo.
Gingerbread Cookies
Very much like the fabled gingerbread man, we want to run far, far away, especially from all of our final essays, psets, and projects. 2020 has been a pretty rough year, so go ahead and add extra sugar in this batch.
Life hasn’t been a cakewalk, so you should reward yourself with some sweets. If possible, ask a family member or friend to try a new dessert together; not only will your taste buds be happy, but you also get to spend some quality time with someone special. Two birds, one scone.

‘Tis the season for... reading period! This year, reading period looks quite a bit different in more ways than one. I mean, who doesn't dream of studying for final exams in their childhood bedroom as they're being stared down by the five-foot horse poster that's been living on the wall ever since their horse girl phase in 2010? That's right, nobody. In any case, my motivation levels are all over the place, so hopefully you relate to this desperate cry into the void too.
