After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sexual harassment is pervasive on Harvard’s campus. Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents faculty assistants, program coordinators, laboratory technicians, and other essential staff, recently had one of their few protections from harassment torn away.
Harvard administrators are refusing to participate in HUCTW’s grievance process for sexual harassment. By walking back its agreement to honor this process, which has been in place since 1989, Harvard is denying its workers the right to seek real recourse on campus.
Harvard and HUCTW agreed that if a union member “experiences a problem in the workplace,” union representatives and the University — workers and their bosses — are supposed to cooperate to resolve the problem. If they cannot resolve the issue, it can be brought to an external mediator, a third-party expert independent of both Harvard and HUCTW, who can provide another perspective on the situation. The mediator’s job is to find a compromise that is acceptable to both sides. Following a lack of compromise, the mediator has the power to make a final decision.
In March, a University spokesperson stated that Harvard must abide by federal Title IX regulations. It is true that federal regulations require Harvard to provide a system for reporting sexual harassment under Title IX. In addition, however, Harvard and HUCTW signed a binding agreement to resolve cases of harassment and discrimination through a separate grievance process.
The administration must consider its legal obligations not only under Title IX, but also under its contract with HUCTW members. By ignoring the union's grievance procedure, Harvard is breaking a promise — and could be in violation of the law.
The procedure in HUCTW’s contract isn’t perfect. Its main shortcoming is that it can be time-consuming and protracted. The process can take years. But it can provide meaningful recourse to victims because it provides access to an independent procedure that the University does not control. The details of past cases are confidential, but contractual mediation can lead to mutually acceptable resolutions — when Harvard respects its legal commitment to the process.
Addressing these complaints can be inconvenient for University administrators, who often have an interest in protecting powerful bosses, managers, and faculty despite patterns of abuse. Perhaps that’s why Harvard is trying to get out of its responsibilities under the contract.
But there are many good reasons why HUCTW staff would not want to report an incident to Harvard’s Title IX Office — now housed under the new Office of Gender Equity. All of Harvard’s Title IX Coordinators are University employees. In addition to their Title IX duties, they have other responsibilities within University administration, which can create a conflict of interest. Harvard workers who report to Title IX have legitimate concerns that they might be outed to their bosses, whatever Harvard’s policies about the confidentiality of Title IX might say in principle. What’s critical is that members of the community have their cases heard by an impartial, knowledgeable third-party expert independent of the University.
Further, the many shortcomings of Title IX were multiplied by new rules enacted by the Trump administration in 2020. The Biden administration is acting to reverse and improve these rules, but the exact approach the new Department of Education will take is not yet clear, and it could be years before any changes go into effect.
Harvard’s choice to abandon its contractual responsibilities is a concern not only for members of HUCTW but for all workers and students at the University. All people have a right — a legal right — to go to work or school without the worry of harassment or discrimination. HUCTW’s contract provides limited protections not only against sexual harassment but also against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and other identities. By disrespecting the procedure for sexual harassment, Harvard is putting all of these protections in question.
Unfortunately, the University’s position on the sexual harassment grievance process for HUCTW workers is already consistent with a general lack of commitment to protecting the community’s fundamental rights. At Harvard, diversity, inclusion, and equity are just buzzwords that appear to “meet the moment” in University-wide emails. However, recent experience shows that if workers and students want their rights to be respected, they have to come together to demand those rights.
HUCTW and several other major campus unions representing graduate students, dining service workers, and other university employees are negotiating new contracts with Harvard. The current contracts expire this summer and fall. When the contracts are up, we’re committed — as rank-and-file members of two of these unions — to organizing for our rights.
We hope you’ll join us.
Geoff Carens, Bailey Plaman, and Eugene van Buren are Harvard University employees and members of HUCTW-AFSCME Local 3650, HGSU-UAW Local 5118, and UNITE HERE Local 26, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Living through history isn’t easy. When Covid pushed millions of students off campuses across the country that fated March, our generation’s college experience was ruptured. It’s been a strange year plus since; one marked by distance and, for many, loneliness and loss. But Zoom is on the backburner and campus life is bubbling up again: chatter in the dining halls, freshmen clinging to their lanyards, and, today, the first print edition of this paper in 538 days.
To our peers and our community: Hi! We’ve missed you.
Seeing campus bursting with life feels like a dream. We certainly felt relief upon hearing we’d get an in-person fall. But it’s impossible to return to a school that kicked you out with five days' notice without having your relationship to that campus change, however infinitely justifiable the decision was.
The pandemic’s handprints are all over our college experience, despite (or perhaps due to) the intense efforts of our university to shield us from its effects. The trauma of having to vacate our dorms, and, for others, of starting college in stark, virtual circumstances still lingers for many, especially as the Delta variant reminds us that we are certainly not out of the woods.
We all know how truly fragile our precious college experience is: the one full of laughter not filtered through webcams and other joys which once felt irrevocable. The exceptional relief we feel at beginning to experience these things again risks morphing into anxiety as students find themselves trapped between the shadow of an old world and the glimmer of a new one that, in many ways, is just as scary as it is exciting.
Each class of students at Harvard has unique apprehensions about returning to campus. Members of the Class of 2025 shoulder all of the typical concerns that are routine for first-year students — Who will my friends be? Will I miss my family? Who do I want to become in this new environment? — but also carry the additional disorientation brought about by their unique admissions cycle, sans Visitas and Opening Days. The ’24s are about as clueless when it comes to the ins and outs of campus life; many are seeing campus for the first time, and even those that have lived in Harvard’s dorms are now navigating an entirely different campus — one where students are swarming into previously shut dining halls, common spaces, and actually (can you believe it?) attending somewhat sanctioned social events. Meanwhile, the ’23s, having experienced less than a year of in-person instruction themselves, have leapfrogged from their freshman spring to their junior fall. And, with only two semesters of college left, the ’22s are now expected to lead, even as the normal torch-passing that would have prepared them to do so has been obliterated.
Against this backdrop, it’s completely normal for students to feel somewhat confused about their relationship to the University. After all, for many, this relationship was never given a real chance to develop. A soft touch is required to ignite or rekindle a sense of community again.
To that end, Harvard needs to create effective programming that helps students orient themselves to campus and genuinely convinces wary, war-torn students that they care. The majority of campus has no clue what norms usually dictate this place — again, only one class of students has spent a full year here! Right now, it feels as if students were let loose on a shell of a campus that can’t quite remember what it's supposed to be or provide. Given our virtual estrangement, maybe the University thought this was enough. But this vacuum needs to be filled by administrators working with students to clearly articulate a set of campus norms we can be proud of, and actively doing community building that brings students into the fold. Students must be involved in this work, especially upperclassmen, but can’t be expected to reorient themselves without a steady hand from Harvard.
It takes commitment to turn a house into a home. Hopefully, through the collective efforts of both students and the University, Harvard can become one.

To our readers:
Eighteen months ago, Harvard shut down its campus — and The Crimson’s printing presses fell silent. Since our last print issue on March 13, 2020, we’ve continued our daily news operation online.
Though spread across continents and time zones, our team of writers, photographers, designers, programmers, and business associates worked tirelessly to innovate new digital methods of delivering our content. Still, the core of our mission — to hold Harvard and its affiliates accountable and keep readers informed — remained, taking on renewed importance as they were cut off from campus, one another, and the people who make decisions on their behalf.
With students across Harvard back in Cambridge for the start of the fall semester, we intend to continue that work — both online and now once again in our daily print newspaper.
Today, as Harvard returns to in-person classes, The Crimson’s first print issue since spring 2020 can be found on news racks across campus. It chronicles an unusual move-in during a pandemic, Harvard’s continued health protocols as the Delta variant rages, political strife over the University’s construction in Allston, and much more. It’s the result of hours of work by our staff members, many of whom stepped into our offices at 14 Plympton St. and met each other face-to-face for the first time this week.
We thank you for continuing to support us online and trusting us as your source for Harvard news throughout the pandemic, and we’re excited to see you paging through our print issues in the dining halls and classrooms again.
Sincerely,
Amanda Y. Su ’22
President of the 148th Guard
James S. Bikales ’22
Managing Editor of the 148th Guard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three Harvard affiliates were separately assaulted near Harvard Square in the past week, though none required medical attention, according to police.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email advisory to University affiliates Sunday that three male graduate students were punched in three separate incidents by a white male, 20 to 40 years old, riding a bicycle. A man matching the same description also committed an assault against a non-University affiliate last week, Catalano wrote.
The Cambridge Police Department is investigating the four incidents, which did not occur on Harvard property.
The four assaults occurred during the day and in the evening. They took place on the corner of Flagg and Banks Street near Mather House, on Kirkland St., at the intersection of Harvey Street and Westley Avenue north of campus, and on the corner of Beacon Street and Scott Street, near the Somerville-Cambridge border, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
CPD has notified its officers stationed in Harvard Square of the incidents “to ensure enhanced attention is focused in the area,” Warnick wrote in an email.
In three of the four incidents, the perpetrator punched the victim without any verbal exchange. None of the victims knew the offender, and it is unclear if the same offender committed all four assaults, according to Harvard police.
In addition to the four reported assaults and batteries, an assailant stole the wallet of an Arlington, Mass. resident in his 40s early Monday morning on the corner of Eliot Street and JFK Street in Harvard Square. The victim later recovered his property and did not suffer any injuries, according to Warnick.
In his advisory, Catalano advised students to be aware of their surroundings, cautioning that Harvard’s “urban setting” presents the “crime and safety issues” that exist in many cities.
“Community members should be vigilant while walking throughout campus and surrounding areas both during the day and at night and to take the appropriate precautions, such as walking with others and utilizing walking escorts, taxi escort (Longwood campus), the shuttle bus and evening van service whenever possible,” he wrote.
Catalano advised affiliates to avoid dimly lit areas, talking on cell phones, listening to music, or walking too close to strangers when outside. They should head for an open store or building if they suspect they are being followed.

A longstanding methodology used to associate human genetic variations with disease risk can help flag more deadly or contagious variants of SARS-CoV-2, including the novel gamma variant, according to new research from the Harvard School of Public Health.
Over the past year, Christoph Lange, a professor at Harvard Medical School, and his research group analyzed more than 7000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from an online database to identify the most highly pathogenic strains. The researchers detected a mutation in a variant later identified as the gamma variant P.1 in Brazil. The group found that P.1 was linked to higher mortality rates, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.
Nan M. Laird, a biostatistics professor at HSPH, who contributed to the study, said the group’s research was an original usage of an established method to predict disease outcomes.
“Historically, the genome-wide association analyses have looked at whether or not an individual's genetic makeup can predict disease in that individual,” Laird said. “What we’re doing here is quite different because we’re asking whether or not mutations in the virus can affect the course of the disease in the individual.”
Georg Hahn, a biostatistics instructor at HSPH and the lead author of the study, said this methodology could be used as a “pre-warning system” to flag and monitor any viral mutants.
Chloe Wu, MIT graduate student who contributed to the study, noted that this approach and similar genetic methodologies have significant potential to identify and prevent the spread of more lethal Covid-19 variants as the pandemic rages on.
“Continuing to apply similar approaches as this pandemic continues to progress would be interesting to see,” Wu said. “The virus is continuing to mutate, and so if you can get an early sense of which mutations might end up being problematic, then we can potentially start to put some of our resources and energy into trying to contain that early on.”
However, the researchers said that current epidemiological databases pose logistical problems for future research with this methodology.
Their research was based on publicly available data in the GISAID database, an open-source platform where users can upload genetic sequences and any relevant clinical or epidemiological data. The database holds over 3 million submissions, but due to a lack of standardization, researchers may find repetitive submissions that exaggerate findings.
Coming up with standardized pipelines for submissions to this database would make the data much easier to use, according to Hahn.
Lange said the research group aims to continue applying this methodology as the pandemic progresses, in hopes of identifying novel strains before they become prevalent.
“We will continue to apply it to see if other new strains surface and if we can detect anything new,” Lange said.

Sporting dresses, suits, and class pins, hundreds of students processed into Tercentenary Theatre for the College’s annual Convocation Tuesday. A few hours later, hundreds more did the same.
In two separate ceremonies throughout the day, Harvard celebrated the arrival to campus of the Class of 2025 as well as the Class of 2024, which was not able to gather this time last year due to health restrictions on campus. The morning’s ceremony focused on sophomores, whose convocation was virtual last year, and the afternoon convocation welcomed current freshmen.
In his address to the Class of 2025, University President Lawrence S. Bacow encouraged freshmen to be appreciative despite the persistent effects of Covid-19.
“Yes, things right now could be a lot better — you know, we could not be wearing these masks, we wouldn’t have so many rules to follow — but we must continue to acknowledge and celebrate all that’s good about being here, all that’s good about being together,” Bacow said. “I really urge you to give yourself a break, and really savor this moment.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in his speech implored freshmen to bring an open mind to perspectives they may disagree with.
“Humility is not a word that many people associate with Harvard. Let’s change that,” Khurana said. “When we listen with humility, we are open to being wrong and recognizing that we know less than what we thought we knew.”
Bacow and Khurana on Tuesday addressed both years, as did Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh. The programs also featured performances by undergraduate vocal groups and the University band.
Last year, members of the Class of 2024 invited to live on campus were unable to experience many freshman traditions, including in-person pre-orientation, convocation, Annenberg dining, and more.
Addressing the Class of 2024 Tuesday morning, O’Dair said she has been waiting 12 months to give students a proper welcome to campus.
“Typically convocation is a ceremony that marks your official start here at Harvard College, and although you are one year behind you at Harvard College, in so many ways, this is a new beginning,” she said. “As we finally reconvene as a full community after so much time apart, this is a good time to think about how we want to reset ourselves and our lives in this unique moment.”
In his remarks to sophomores, Khurana described opportunities and challenges students’ second year at the College may bring.
“After a year of living with so much uncertainty, it’s understandable that you may begin this year with anxiety and more uncertainty,” he said. “I know I am a little bit.”
“It might be about your concentration, about what you want to commit your time and energy to, but I hope you will give yourself permission to live with that uncertainty for a while,” Khurana added.
Bacow assured the Class of 2024 that Harvard is committed to providing “as normal” a college experience as possible.
“We’re all — let’s face it — trying to find our own footing this semester,” Bacow said. “I want you to know that there are many, many people on this campus dedicated to ensuring that your second year at Harvard College is everything that you hope it to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will require its student athletes to undergo additional Covid-19 testing as the College resumes athletics competition this fall.
Vaccinated members of Harvard’s 42 varsity teams will be required to test twice per week, the athletic department informed student athletes last week, per guidance issued by Harvard University Health Services. Harvard is requiring non-athletes to submit a Covid test once per week.
Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott explained in an emailed statement Monday that the department implemented the policy so that athletes can safely train and compete maskless this semester — in both indoor and outdoor sports. University guidelines otherwise require all affiliates to wear a mask indoors.
Harvard’s varsity teams have not competed since March 2020, when the Ivy League canceled competition at the onset of the pandemic.
“Athletics consulted with HUHS and EH&S [Environmental, Health & Safety] on plans for student-athletes to train and compete this fall. Part of that plan included seeking an exception for student-athletes in wearing masks inside while training and competing,” McDermott wrote. “The requirement in granting an exception is for the testing cadence to increase to twice per week.”
Brant D. Berkstresser, associate athletics director for student-athlete health and performance, wrote in an email announcing the policy to student athletes last week that the additional testing is “for the overall health and safety of yourselves and the Harvard Community.”
Athletics will require unvaccinated student athletes to submit a Covid-19 test three times per week, Berkstresser noted in his email.
Liam J.C. Rotzoll ’23-’24, a member of the men’s squash team, said he is willing to undergo a nasal swab one additional time per week if it enables him and his teammates to compete for Harvard.
“Whatever needs to be done for the season to go through smoothly should be done,” Rotzoll said.
Rotzoll said he has become used to wearing a mask while playing due to mask mandates near his home, but that it was a nuisance.
“That’s a great resolution for all athletes,” Rotzoll said of Harvard’s decision.
One of his teammates, Conner H. Stoltz ’24-’25, also said he is happy Harvard will exclude athletes like himself from the indoor-mask mandate.
“I’m always sweating a lot so when I’m halfway through the game, it’s just a mask sticking to my face, which makes it even harder to breathe. So I definitely think it makes a difference,” he said. “I really hope they don’t change that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citing poor outreach by Harvard, several state and local legislators submitted a letter to acting Boston Mayor Kim M. Janey last month requesting a moratorium on “all decision-making processes” related to development of two Harvard-related projects in Allston.
Boston City Councilor Elizabeth A. “Liz” Breadon, State Sen. Sal N. DiDomenico, and State Reps. Kevin G. Honan and Michael J. Moran all signed the letter, dated Aug. 13, which asks for a pause on the review processes for the Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus and the Western Avenue Corridor Study and Rezoning until after Boston’s November mayoral election.
The signatories wrote they fear the projects are “being rushed” to allow for approval in advance of the election. Postponing the review processes until after the elections will allow Bostonians the opportunity to shape the trajectory of local urban planning through their votes, they argued.
A number of “unresolved issues” — from public transit to affordability to sustainability to equity and inclusion — remain in the development plans, per the signatories.
Harvard’s outreach, the letter alleges, has been “grossly insufficient.” Despite Harvard’s claim to one-third of the land in Allston, the University has “no established plan” for outreach, instead relying on the developer for communication, they argued.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard representatives “routinely participate in public meetings,” actions they are “proud” of and believe have benefitted the area. O’Rourke added that the University committed to additional outreach efforts at the ERC public meeting on July 27, during which developers upped affordable housing and sustainability pledges.
Moran, one of the state representatives who signed the letter, said in an interview that the neighborhood should not be “saddled with something” by a mayoral administration that “wasn’t ever really elected by the people,” referring to Janey, who was sworn in after former Mayor Martin J. Walsh became U.S. Labor Secretary in March 2021.
“It’s time to wait for the next administration to come in, and then let them do it,” Moran said. “Right now I just don’t think it’s right to have somebody who’s not duly elected by the people.”
Janey declined to comment on the letter, instead deferring to the Boston Planning and Development Agency, which approves development projects and is spearheading outreach with Harvard.
BPDA spokesperson Bonnie McGilpin wrote in an email the agency will “continue to work closely” with all stakeholders and that, even under the current review, the project would not be brought to a vote by the BPDA board prior to November.
Asked what Harvard, the developers, and the BPDA should do to ensure resident input, Moran said that neighborhood organizations like the Harvard-Allston Task Force “should have more teeth.”
“They should be able to seriously affect development and not in an advisory way,” he added.
This latest political request comes as local residents have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the University’s outreach efforts.
Climate justice activist and elementary school teacher Justin L. Brown said he agrees with the letter’s demand to postpone the development process and believes that Harvard’s outreach has been “spotty” and “insufficient.”
Brown added that Harvard-Allston Task Force members and residents who can attend meetings are “privileged” and that existing outreach efforts miss locals who will be affected by development, but cannot attend meetings. He recommended Harvard engage with residents in concrete ways, such as canvassing and calling.
“Harvard should be finding ways to reach out to those people,” he said. “Making sure that it’s crystal clear that Harvard University has big plans for this neighborhood and needs to hear from everybody to make sure that the process is as transparent as possible, as democratic as possible.”
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association and Harvard-Allston Task Force member, said he fears that Harvard development in Allston will turn the area into one like Boston’s Seaport district, which the letter’s signatories suggested perpetuates racial and socioeconomic inequities in the city.
For D’Isidoro, the extent to which Harvard development would transform Allston compels a “proportional response” from Harvard administrators, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
“I think we’ll find out that we can agree on a lot more than disagree if we just get the right people involved in the right discussions,” he said.

UPDATED: Sept. 2, 2021 at 1:35 p.m. 
As Harvard embarks on a return to in-person learning and on-campus living, the University has adjusted Covid-19 safety protocols for its vaccinated and larger student population.
With the University-wide vaccination mandate in place, health guidelines vary most between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. As of Monday, 94 percent of employees and 92 percent of students have been inoculated against the coronavirus. The student vaccination rate is up from 87 percent on Aug. 18, before students moved in and international students were offered vaccines upon arrival.
Drawn from Harvard documents available online, here is an overview of Harvard’s updated Covid-19 guidelines for the fall semester:
All Harvard University affiliates are required to get fully vaccinated for Covid-19, except when provided an exemption for medical or religious reasons.
Unvaccinated affiliates may need to follow additional guidelines, such as more frequent testing cadences.
With a few exceptions, individuals are no longer required to follow distancing requirements, indoors or outdoors, though the University encourages those who are unvaccinated to physically distance when possible.
Indoors: Regardless of vaccination status, everyone is required to wear a mask indoors, except for a few exceptions. Those include when actively eating or drinking, spending time alone in a dorm, and visiting other residences where everyone is vaccinated.
Outdoors: While outdoors, unvaccinated individuals closer than six feet from others must wear a mask.
Harvard will continue to partner with health software company Color to provide testing kits and test results. Similar to previous semesters, individuals will self-swab and drop off samples at designated boxes throughout campus.
Unlike in the fall 2020 and spring 2021, Harvard will process tests at its own clinical lab instead of sending them through the Broad Institute. Harvard University Health Services said on its website that the new lab was created to "expand testing capacity to larger numbers of community members."
Cadences:
Vaccinated students, faculty, and staff: once per week
Unvaccinated students, faculty, and staff: twice per week
Students can view their testing schedule on their Color dashboard.
Results:
Negative: No additional action is required.
Unsatisfactory or Inconclusive: Individuals should submit another sample. Results may be unsatisfactory because the sample sat in a collection bin for too long, the tube cap came off, or other reasons.
Positive: Individuals should immediately minimize exposure to others. HUHS will reach out to explain next steps as well as conduct contact tracing.
Isolation: Upon testing positive, affiliates will need to isolate into separate housing or in their own rooms, usually for at least 10 days.
Quarantine: Unvaccinated individuals who have been exposed to a positive case will be required to quarantine. Those who are exposed but fully vaccinated and asymptomatic do not have to move into isolation housing, including roommates of infected individuals. While in quarantine, they may grab and go with meals in the dining hall.
University Support: Harvard will conduct wellness checks, and provide academic support for those who are in isolation or quarantine.
The contact tracing and case investigation process remains the same from the past year.
Previously, Harvard required affiliates to complete a Crimson Clear form every day before entering a University facility. This semester, Harvard asks affiliates to fill out the form after experiencing symptoms, testing positive, or being exposed to Covid-19.
There are no social distancing or mask requirements for fully vaccinated students while outdoors, including for outdoor performances and rehearsals.
Indoor gatherings inside residential dorms and houses are limited to 10 people. Capacity limits are lifted for larger gatherings, but they must be sponsored by Harvard and supervised.
Masks do not have to be worn while eating and drinking at indoor gatherings, although it is advised that attendees be notified beforehand if food and beverages are provided.
In libraries, students may temporarily remove masks to take a sip of water, but they must put it back on between sips.
In classrooms, students cannot remove their masks even to take a sip of water.
Masks are required for instructors in the FAS at all times indoors.
According to University-wide rules, which are superseded by school-specific policies, one professor or lecturer at a time can remove their mask in the classroom. They must keep a 6 feet distance from others, be fully vaccinated, and submit to Covid-19 testing twice a week. Before removal, they must announce to students: “In accordance with University guidance, the lecturer of this course will be removing their face covering for the purposes of instruction only. A distance of 6 ft from all class participants will be maintained at all times while unmasked. Per University policy, face coverings are required for all other classroom participants.”
For indoor rehearsals: performers are required to stay masked. They may only remove their masks on performance day if approved by their school, and while staying 6 feet apart and 14 feet away from the audience.
Any unmasked performers must be fully vaccinated and exhibit no Covid-19 symptoms. While vaccinated students are only subjected to weekly virus testing, performers must submit at least two tests per week.
Consistent with University mask rules, all outdoor activities may continue without face coverings if participants are vaccinated. Any club and intramural sports played indoors require participants to wear masks at all times.
While only some Harvard gyms and fitness centers remain open, the indoor face covering and distancing requirements still apply. The only exception is for pools, where masks are required to and from the locker room and encouraged on the pool deck.
Face coverings are required on all University vehicles, including shuttles and evening vans. The number of vehicle occupants may return to levels before the pandemic.
CORRECTIONS: September 2, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated the masking rules for instructors in classrooms. In the FAS, masks are required for instructors at all times indoors. University-wide rules allow for masks to be removed in certain situations, but these rules are superseded by school-specific policies. 
A previous version of this article misstated the masking rules in libraries. Students may temporarily remove masks to take a sip of water in libraries, and put it back on between sips.
A previous version of this article misstated the dining rules for students in quarantine. They may grab and go from the dining hall. 
A previous version of this article misstated the masking rules for brass or woodwind musicians. They must wear a mask at all times while rehearsing, but they may use slitted, instrument masks under certain conditions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A highly-regarded behavioral economics paper on preventing fraud in self-reports, co-authored by two Harvard Business School professors, has been submitted for retraction following allegations that the data itself is fraudulent and fabricated.
The paper, co-authored by Business School professors Max H. Bazerman and Francesca Gino, was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 2012. The study found that people were less likely to lie if they signed an honesty declaration at the beginning rather than the end of a form. Its findings were used widely by insurance companies, corporate executives, and government agencies to fight fraudulent reporting behavior.
On Aug. 17, Data Colada, a quantitative analysis blog, published a post claiming to have found “very strong evidence” that the data in one of the field studies is fraudulent. Co-authors Uri Simonsohn, Leif D. Nelson, and Joseph P. Simmons urged journals to require publication of data along with the results of studies.
Four of the five co-authors told BuzzFeed News in August that they were not involved in the data collection for that experiment, which was run by an insurance company on its customers.
The one researcher who was in contact with the insurance company, Duke School of Business professor Dan Ariely, wrote in a statement posted on Data Colada that he did not fabricate the data and “was not involved in the data collection, data entry, or merging data with information from the insurance database for privacy reasons.”
The integrity of Ariely’s research has been questioned on at least two occasions before, according to Buzzfeed News. In 2008, he published research claiming that asking test-takers to recall the Ten Commandments before an exam reduced cheating, but external researchers failed to replicate the results. Editors recently added a note to a study he completed in 2004 when he failed to provide the journal with accompanying data.
Ariely told BuzzFeed News that his contacts at the insurer — The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., an insurance and investment company — had no recollection of the data file’s origins or its analysis.
In an email to The Crimson, Boston University professor Nina Mažar, a co-author on the study, wrote that the fieldwork was completed years before her involvement in January 2011. Mažar wrote that Ariely publicly reported results of the field study by 2009, and she received the data in an email from Ariely in February 2011.
“Like the three other co-authors, I had no files or concrete information about the insurance field study prior to the Shu et al. collaboration,” she wrote.
In 2020, the five researchers and two additional co-authors published a paper in PNAS refuting their own findings and noting their inability to replicate the results from the 2012 paper. They published their original data along with the article.
In a statement to The Crimson provided by Business School spokesperson Brian C. Kenny on behalf of Bazerman and Gino, the professors expressed appreciation for Data Colada’s analysis.
“We are grateful to Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson for their efforts to improve research in social science and the careful analyses they undertook of our 2012 PNAS paper,” they wrote.
Though he admitted the paper’s flaws, Ariely told BuzzFeed News that he still believes the “principle” behind the 2012 paper is correct.
“It is my understanding that the data file that the Data Colada post examined is the same that all of us coauthors had available since well before our first submission to PNAS in June 2012,” Mažar wrote in an email to The Crimson. “In hindsight, all five of us should have done a better job of scrutinizing it.”
Bazerman and Gino, along with first author Lisa L. Shu, submitted a letter to PNAS editors requesting retraction of the 2012 paper on July 22.
Prashant Nair, a representative of the PNAS News Office, declined to comment on when the 2012 paper will be retracted and if the journal would take measures to prevent fraudulent studies in the future.
“We are aware of the situation and are in communication with the authors,” Nair wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time, Harvard would allow student workers to pursue complaints of discrimination and “abusive or intimidating behavior” through an appeals process that could end in third-party arbitration under its latest contract proposal to its graduate student union Tuesday.
The University also proposed a $14 million increase in compensation and benefits over the three-year duration of the contract.
Tuesday also marked the expiration date of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’s contract with the University, which was extended last month. After Harvard’s negotiators presented the new package of proposals to HGSU-UAW on Tuesday, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 released Harvard’s full package of proposals in a University-wide email.
“Our graduate students have an important role in Harvard’s academic and research mission, and the updated comprehensive package proposal the University put forward today provides strong compensation and benefits that will continue to support their important work,” Garber wrote. “It also includes new proposals in line with our ongoing work to provide an environment free from harassment and discrimination.”
Under the University’s new non-discrimination proposal, student workers must first follow Harvard’s internal procedure for discrimination cases. If a student worker believes the University investigators in their case were biased against them, they can appeal the decision through Harvard’s internal processes or file a grievance with the union for potential third-party arbitration.
Student workers would not be able to appeal, however, in cases related to academic retaliation or Title IX and gender-based discrimination. HGSU-UAW’s proposal for non-discrimination procedures calls for the option of a union procedure that ends in third-party arbitration for all identity-based discrimination, sexual harassment, and academic retaliation cases.
According to Garber, allowing third-party arbitration for Title IX and gender-based discrimination could “violate federal regulations.”
Union and University representatives are also meeting in working groups to recommend new policies and practices addressing sexual harassment, discrimination, and bullying, as part of the current HGSU-UAW contract. Recommendations from the working groups are expected in the coming months, according to Garber.
HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said the University’s proposal is “not everything we wanted,” but a step closer to the union’s position.
“It is a very small part of a grievance procedure that we would like to see for harassment and discrimination cases, but the fact that for the first time Harvard has recognized that arbitration is a legitimate option for student workers in some cases — that’s a big deal,” he said.
Harvard’s newest compensation proposal includes a 2.5 percent increase in salaries and teaching rates in the first year of the contract upon ratification, with 3 percent increases in the second and third years. Previously, the University had proposed an initial 2 percent raise, followed by two 2.5 percent raises. The proposal also raises the minimum wage for hourly student workers to $20 over the duration of the contract.
In addition to the 8.5 percent total increase to compensation, the University proposed a $1.8 million increase to the union’s existing benefit pools, with $600,000 increases annually, meaning the pools would total $2.75 million in the third year of the contract. Hourly student workers would also be able to access the benefit pools for the first time.
On health care, Harvard offered to cover 75 percent of premiums for salaried Ph.D. students in a new preventive dental plan or pay the dollar equivalent in premiums for its existing plan. Previously, the University said it would cover 50 percent of the new dental premiums.
According to its website, HGSU-UAW’s latest proposals for compensation and benefits are still larger than the University’s proposals. The union is asking for a raise of more than 15 percent over the course of the contract and a total increase of $3 million to the benefit pools.
The University’s latest package comes after HGSU-UAW began organizing a strike authorization vote, which will start Sept. 13. Harvard has also proposed federal mediation, Garber wrote in his email Tuesday. The two parties reached their first contract agreement after they met with a federal mediator following the union’s first strike in 2019.
The union is still discussing the University’s offer of mediation, but Mancilla said the Bargaining Committee prefers continuing direct talks. He added that the Bargaining Committee will not accept Harvard’s latest package, even though it marks “a far more substantial offer.”
“We don’t plan on accepting this deal,” Mancilla said. “The next step is to review to see what we like about it, see what’s workable, and send them a counter that engages with and also asserts our position on some things, just how we’ve been doing.”
The two parties will meet again next week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Grace Li ’25 first arrived on campus, she said the moment she stepped foot through Johnston Gate onto Harvard Yard felt “unreal.”
“The first highlight was just driving through Johnston Gate, kind of felt a little bit unreal and really loved the people welcoming there,” said Li, who lives in Grays Hall.
Li joined thousands of undergraduates who returned to a full capacity campus between Aug. 20 and Aug. 28 after spending nearly 18 months scattered across the globe. The College followed a staggered move-in format, inviting different class cohorts to settle in their housing accommodations across the week-long period.
Though only having been on campus for a short period, some undergraduates expressed how “ecstatic” they felt to be with their full class cohorts.
“The campus feels so much more alive and exciting,” said Nicholas J. Brennan ’23, who lives in Winthrop House. Brennan said living on campus during the spring semester felt “very isolating” due to the College’s social distancing protocols.
“It’s crazy to walk into a dining hall and see all the faces that, for so long, you almost have forgotten existed,” Brennan said. “So to be reintroduced to everyone has been fantastic, and it’s brought a lot of energy and hope back.”
Patrick A. Singleton ’22, who stayed on-campus during the spring semester, said he was looking forward to more social interactions following a spring semester that was heavily regulated by social distancing guidelines.
“Everyone was very distant in the spring, both physically but also sort of socially,” Singleton said. “Now I think people are a whole lot more eager to just hang out, talk to each other.”
“I just want that time to hang out, talk to people, maybe play games, walk around, go out to dinner,” he added. “Also intramural sports, I know we’re kicking those back up around here. I love IMs.”
Other undergraduates expressed anticipation to reconnect with classmates.
“Honestly it just makes my heart happy to see ... so many people I haven’t seen in so long,” Grace R. Hulslander ’23 said. “And I think that’s what college is all about in the end.”
“Going to the dining hall and not planning to see people but then walking into them and being able to sit with them is so special,” Hulslander added.
Students who arrived on Aug. 22 and Aug. 23 said they expected their move-in to be adversely affected by Hurricane Henri — the first hurricane to make landfall in New England in three decades — but did not experience as much trouble as anticipated.
“Even though I moved in on the day that Hurricane Henri was supposed to be in Boston, the process was very easy,” Ahmad Alsheikh ’24 said.
Many undergraduates said they were looking forward to returning to normal school activities, such as attending sporting events and in-person classes.
“I’m so excited for football games, Harvard-Brown, Harvard-Dartmouth, especially Harvard-Yale,” Huslander said.
Tejas S. S. Vadali ’25 said he had been reading through Harvard’s course catalog in preparation for classes and was particularly interested in “Government 20: Foundations of Comparative Politics.”
“I went on a Zoom call with Professor Levitsky on an information session for Gov 20,” Vadali said. “He is incredibly funny. He seems like a great personality, and that’s one of the classes I’m really excited to take this semester.”
Though the school year has just begun, Brennan said he believes the potential of greater social interaction among undergraduates will enhance the student experience this fall.
“Having the opportunity to sit down and come together and make those connections has really been amazing,” Brennan said. “I think it’s going to help define the semester as one of the best that we’ve had in a very long time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even after four years of evading opponents in Blodgett Pool as a Harvard undergraduate, former Men’s Water Polo player Joseph H. Kaufman ’89 had never taken on a physical task as daunting as swimming the nearly 30-mile loop around Manhattan. That is until this summer, when Kaufman decided to take the plunge through the turbulent tides of the East, Harlem, and Hudson Rivers in New York City.
With stamina and perseverance, 28.5 grueling miles later, Kaufman completed the “20 Bridge Swim” around the Big Apple, reaching the finish line in eight hours and 27 minutes. In the process, the former Crimson water polo standout completed one of the world’s most famous open-water treks, alongside the English Channel crossing and the Catalina Island to Los Angeles route.
“Outdoor swimming is a wonderful experience,” Kaufman recalled. “The first two hours of the swim in the East River were probably two of the best hours I’ve ever swum.”
The swim starts at Battery Park and goes up the East River, which passes landmarks such as the South Street Seaport, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the United Nations. After passing Gracie Mansion, the home of the Mayor of New York City, swimmers turn into the Harlem River at Hell Gate before they reach the third leg of the swim, the Hudson River.
“You see the Empire State Building come into view and the UN building and you’re seeing all these amazing sights and it's just fantastic, and then you get past that and you’ve got some more challenging conditions, and it becomes a slog at times where you just have to keep your head down,” Kaufman remarked.
Kaufman first signed up for the swim around two years ago. “People from all over the world come to New York to try this. This year, I think fewer people were able to come internationally to New York to give it a try, so I got off the waiting list and had a slot in July.”
“I had been doing some swims of like two to three hours. I stepped it up a couple years ago to a longer swim up the Hudson that was 18 miles, but with the current, it took about five and a half hours. I sort of realized that this one might be doable in theory.”
To prepare for the swim, Kaufman made sure to get into the water at least three times a week but couldn’t get into open waters in New York until around May when temperatures permitted.
“Once I found out I got a spot in February, it really was a matter of trying to find pool time and just slowly build up the endurance,” he recalled.
“One of the interesting things is you don’t have to be a fast swimmer to do these, you just have to be able to swim moderately for a long amount of time without getting tired, and so it really was a different type of training than I was used to.”
With a swim team, some of the focus is placed on sprints, practicing different strokes and distances. While training for this marathon swim, however, Kaufman commented that, “a lot of the focus was swimming at a set pace and doing it for several hours without stopping and without getting your heart rate up into a zone where it's hard to sustain.”
Part of what makes training for the Manhattan Swim so difficult is its location in Northeast open waters: weather and water conditions are often unpredictable.
“In a pool, I’m usually a minute twenty, a minute twenty-five for a hundred yards, but it's different in open waters because you don’t have the walls to push off and turn, so it's slower, and then in open water, it really depends on the conditions,” Kaufman said.
“The longest training I did for this was when I was out on Long Island Sound in Connecticut over the Fourth of July weekend and just swam back and forth from these buoys for four [hours] and fifteen minutes.”
During the swim, Kaufman was accompanied by a kayaker and a boat who followed him the entire time. Every thirty minutes, he would stop for water and liquid nutrition.
“When I got into the Hudson, the winds picked up, so it was [bumpier]. It's a really big river, and I was right in the middle of it,” he remembered. “That was probably the most challenging part of it. It was a bit choppy, and I was swimming for so many hours.”
Kaufman reflected that advice from his sister as well as his past experience in grueling water polo matches and endurance swims gave him the extra push to finish the daunting 20 Bridges Swim.
“My sister kept reminding me to be like Dory from Nemo, you know, ‘just keep swimming.’ There are times where my back started to hurt and I felt a little tired, but I never was close to saying ‘I’m done,’ you know, having that past experience where you just have to keep going, bear down, and plow through it.”
Though Kaufman trained with teammates and friends and on his own at times, the water polo alumnus was no stranger to spending hours in the water training due to his time at Harvard.
“I think the process leading up to the swim tied mostly to my prior experience as a college athlete, which is that you have to put in the work in practice and in training, and if you put in that and you’re dedicated and keep focused, the end result pays off.”
Kaufman played water polo all four years at Harvard, and he also competed on the men’s swim team his junior year. Though Kaufman has not played water polo after his time at Harvard, he kept up with swimming regularly, something that has prepared him to take on this marathon swim.
“I came to Harvard, and I didn’t even know I would be playing water polo until the first couple days living in Stoughton. The captain of the water polo team showed up and said ‘Where are you? We’re practicing.’”
“My roommate in Eliot House was the captain of the swim team. I always felt like I wanted to give it one extra try to see what I could do,” he recalled.
Though Kaufman swam for the Crimson only for one year, he joined at an exciting time in Harvard Swimming and Diving history when swimming legend David Berkoff ’89 was breaking national records and challenging conventional swimming technique by staying underwater as long as possible.
“The first time anybody really was successful was in this Princeton meet...when [Berkoff] jumped in and broke the American record at the 100 backstroke. He wound up holding the record at the 100-meter backstroke and got the silver medal [in the Olympics], but he was so successful with his technique that they changed the rules. And now in the Olympics you actually have to come up to the surface after 15 meters; you can’t go the whole length [underwater].”
As for Kaufman, and many Harvard alumni, his Harvard roots never seem to fade. Kaufman was greeted at the finish line by an old friend at Harvard who used to play on the Women’s Water Polo team and introduced him and his wife.
As for this new aquatic challenge he has conquered, Kaufman remarked that “having challenges in life is critical, wherever you are in your life. Certainly right now, I’m in the best physical condition I’ve been in as an adult. And not having this to look at — and to a certain extent, scare me— I’m sure that wouldn’t have been the case.”
Interestingly enough, Kaufman also wrote for the sports section of The Crimson, writing the beats for both the Men’s and Women’s Swimming and Diving teams. In the winter season of 1989, Kaufman wrote this article on Berkoff when he broke both American and NCAA records in Blodgett Pool after his return from the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a hiatus of nearly two years, Harvard women’s soccer returned to action on Friday with a 1-0 home win over Fairfield University in front of an enthusiastic crowd at Ohiri Field. The Crimson (1-0) dominated the game and could have scored much more than the goal junior forward Angela Caloia tallied in the 10th minute in what was the first home Harvard sports game since the onset of the pandemic, making it a monumental event for the women’s soccer team and Crimson sports as a whole.
“There were a ton of people at the game, there were probably over a thousand people there,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “It was really, really cool. Such a fun environment to be in. It’s been great being back. The excitement and the energy are through the roof. The players have been bouncing off the walls with excitement to be back in preseason, to be back playing, back with friends.”
The fan support topped Harvard’s expectations, with Hamblin estimating attendance at over a thousand people. The onlookers provided an energy that the Crimson hopes will surround its season going forward.
“It was pretty surreal,” junior captain Sophie Hirst said. “I know I was anticipating it a lot over the past two years, not being able to be with the team at all in person. Then on Friday when we got to suit up, it was very, very cool to see how many people were just as excited as we were to see sports return to campus. We had a great crowd and so much support, and there’s nothing more fun than to play in front of so many people. I was not expecting it to be so amazing for our first game out, and it just really made it cool for us.”
Harvard treated its fans to a strong all-around performance. The Crimson conceded only three shots against the overmatched Stags, making it a relatively easy day for goalkeepers junior Hannah Gardner and sophomore Anna Karpenko, who combined for the shutout. Harvard controlled possession and peppered 22 shots at Fairfield’s goal, with first-year forward Ainsley Ahmadian leading the way with seven shots in her first collegiate game.
Caloia, the Italian U19 international who burst onto the scene in her first year in 2019 with six goals and 11 assists in 16 games, broke the early deadlock with an opportunistic dart into the box. She capitalized on a defensive misjudgment by Fairfield, running onto a bouncing ball and producing a tidy first-time finish past the Stags’ goalie from about 10 yards out. Sophomore midfielder Megan Mackey later hit the post as the Crimson ratcheted up the pressure, but Harvard would not be able to add to its lead.
The Crimson’s performance was not as smooth as Hamblin would have liked, something that he said was only natural in all of the participants’ first competitive college game in a year and 10 months.
“The energy was exceptional — we were the first team back in, and there were probably some things that a calmer approach would have helped us solve sooner,” Hamblin said. “But I think in the grand scheme of things, it’s really difficult to take a group that hasn’t played in two years and have them be calm. I don’t think it’s possible. But I think having that first game under our belt and learning from some of the things that we could have done better has been really helpful the last few days.”
As would be expected after two long years, the Harvard lineup featured a lot of new faces. Four first-years started and five more first-time players got substantial playing time off the bench. Among the underclassmen are a litany of players with experience on their respective senior national teams, including Danish midfielder Josefine Hasbo, Canadian defender Jade Rose, and Iceland teammates Hildur Hakonardottir and Aslaug Gunnlaugsdottir.
Integrating the geographically diverse group of new faces has been a priority for captains Jillian Wachira and Hirst.
“We’re trying to incorporate everyone’s experience, and we’re trying to make sure that everyone feels comfortable,” Wachira said. “I think we’ve done a really good job of setting aside time for team-bonding activities and really just trying to get to know our underclassmen.”
Also returning are most of the Crimson’s standout stars from a team that lost just three games and nearly won the Ivy League title in 2019, including Caloia, senior midfielder Murphy Agnew, Hirst, sophomore forward Gabby DelPico, and junior midfielder Lara Schenk. The result is a roster deep with talent and experience, and one that hopes to get over the hump and win its first Ancient Eight title since 2016, a hunger that was only intensified by the season nixed by the pandemic.
“For us, winning a ring — we lost a year basically and we haven’t won a ring in a while, so that’s definitely at the forefront of everyone’s mind,” Wachira said. “After the tough time we’ve had apart, that would be the cherry on top, to come back and have a successful season and win the Ivy League we’ve been itching for for years now.”
Given the team’s depth and talent, the Crimson should have a good chance to do what they could not in 2019. Harvard returns to action on Thursday at Boston University before coming home to face St. John’s University in what will be only the second-ever meeting between the teams.

After a long year of online learning, Harvard’s campus is finally back in full swing. But while this past week of orientation (and reorientation) has reminded us of all the best college has to offer, a new semester looms ahead. Just because we’re offline doesn’t mean we’re off the hook, so here’s Flyby’s guide to navigating the stress and chaos of our collective return to reality.
Find your study spots early
In case the addition of a new first-year yard and the gaggles of lanyard-clad students didn’t make it clear, Harvard’s campus is more full than ever before. Unless you’re ready to fight for a place in the Smith Center or stake out a desk in Lamont, we suggest you take the time to explore the less crowded spots across the campus and the Square before midterm season rolls around. Check out the Barker Center, invade the grad schools, and stake your territory while you can.
Make friends in class
Let’s be real: embracing collaboration over Zoom was often a nightmare and near impossible. With the age of breakout rooms seemingly (hopefully) behind us, now is your chance to find new friends and pset buddies in real, actual classrooms. Make even your toughest classes more bearable by getting to know those brave souls suffering along with you.
Step offline when you can
Even before our lives centered around Zoom, we tended to spend long hours gazing into our laptops and phones — whether for CS50 psets or Netflix. Now that we’re back in Cambridge, make sure to block out time to enjoy the in-person campus experience... actually in-person. Try visiting one of Harvard’s museums — the Harvard Art Museums are reopening this weekend! — or going for a walk or bike ride along the river, especially before the notorious Boston winter rolls around. Alternatively, just keep off your phone in the dhall. Unplug and unwind.
Go. To. Office. Hours.
This advice isn’t super specific to being back in person, and you have doubtlessly heard this a million times. But I’ll say it again. GO. It may feel daunting to stay motivated after taking classes from your bedroom or in pajamas all last year, but it’s always worth the extra effort to get to know your professors and get your questions answered.
Explore Cambridge and Boston 
Last year, Harvard students logged into class from all around the world, and now we’re all packed together into a few square miles. Though there’s always so much to do on campus, don’t let yourself get stuck in the Harvard bubble. Remember the real world? She’s still out there, and only a T ride away.
Be open to new experiences
Whether this is your first time on campus or your last hurrah, go into this semester ready to try new foods, clubs, classes, etc. The Harvard we’ve come back to isn’t the same exact Harvard we left in March 2020, and we’re not the same people who left it. No two school years are ever the same, actually. The whole point is to use whatever time you have on campus to learn and grow as much as you can — and we all now know how fast that time can disappear.

Beginning Aug. 20, Harvard welcomed back undergraduate students over the span of a staggered move-in, which saw the campus return to full capacity for the first time since March 2020.
Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana greets a freshman and their family in front of Widener Library on Friday, the third and final day of the staggered move-in for freshmen. While most freshmen were assigned to a dorm in Harvard Yard, which houses only freshmen, high enrollment in the Class of 2025 prompted the College to expand its housing capacity by reassigning what is usually upperclassmen overflow housing to freshmen.
Cars line up in front of Matthews Hall as freshmen unpack their belongings and enter their dorms for the first time. Move-in is one of the few occasions in which Harvard Yard is open to traffic — and one of the only opportunities to “park the car in Harvard Yard.”
A freshman and his parents pose for a photo with Grays Hall and Matthews Hall in the background. During or following a short unpacking period, families embrace before eventually parting ways for the start of the semester.
Students walk past the welcome tent set up in the middle of Harvard Yard where freshmen check-in, receive their keys, and pick up their Harvard Register, a yearbook of their class.
Amid the chaos of move-in, students, parents, and staff stop for a moment in front of Grays Hall to meet and chat on Aug. 25, a sunny first day of freshman move-in.
Dean of Students Katie O’Dair and University President Lawrence S. Bacow greet students in the Yard.
