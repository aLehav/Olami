After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard reduced its stock holdings by 35 percent during the first quarter of 2010, even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 4 percent over the same period.
According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing released Friday, Harvard had nearly $1.78 billion in U.S. stocks and exchange-traded index funds (ETFs), compared with $2.26 billion in the previous quarter. The decline leaves the value of the University’s stock holdings at about September 2009 levels.
Harvard’s 13-F filing last quarter indicated that the University had returned to the stock market after selling off large portions of its stock holdings during last year’s recession, but this latest filing shows that Harvard money managers have reduced their exposure to the stock market in the quarter ending March 31.
Friday’s filing only includes stocks traded on U.S. exchanges and owned directly by Harvard Management Company. It does not include investments managed by outside money managers, who invest about two-thirds of the University endowment.
But the filing does provide a glimpse into the University’s investment strategy, as Harvard’s stock portfolio continued to be centered around emerging markets, which comprise about 75 percent of the University’s stock holdings.
As seen in past filings, about 65 percent of University stock holdings are in a basket of 12 emerging market index funds—which track the performance of foreign markets such as Brazil, India, and Mexico, but are traded on domestic exchanges—though the amount held in these ETFs declined over the past quarter.
The University slightly reduced its holdings in these funds over the past quarter as part of its broader move to decrease stock market investments and gave up its holdings in several other national market funds, including those from Hong Kong and Turkey.
Among its holdings in U.S. companies, the University appeared to have moved away from certain sectors, in particular the financial sector. HMC sold its $35 million holding in Bank of America and its smaller investment in Citigroup.
While HMC appears to have largely sold off stock holdings during the past quarter, it acquired a $30 million stake in Brinks Home Security, which recently merged with another security company.
Last quarter, the University had invested in two stocks familiar to its student body—the fast food chain Chipotle and comics giant Marvel Entertainment—but those investments did not appear in yesterday’s filings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 4:22 p.m.
Adam B. Wheeler—the former Harvard student who was indicted Monday for fabricating an elaborate academic history that led him to prestigious scholarly honors—pled not guilty to 20 charges during his arraignment at the Middlesex Superior Court this morning.
Recounting Wheeler’s “life of lies and deceit,” Assistant District Attorney John C. Verner told Clerk Magistrate Michael A. Sullivan that Wheeler submitted fraudulent documents—including plagiarized essays, letters of recommendation, false transcripts, and fake SAT scores—to Harvard College, among other institutions.
Wheeler, 23, was indicted yesterday on counts of larceny, identity fraud, falsifying an endorsement or approval, and pretending to hold a degree. He was allegedly "untruthful" in his applications to Harvard and in various applications, such as the Rhodes and the Fulbright Scholarships, according to a statement released Monday by Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone.
Prosecutors said that Wheeler defrauded Harvard out of over $45,000 in the form of an $8,000 research grant, $6,000 in English prizes, and $31,806 in financial aid.
"Mr. Wheeler pled not guilty. He'll have his day in court," said Steven Sussman, the defendant's lawyer, who was surrounded by a thick crowd of reporters and cameramen. "He's not convicted of anything."
"He's a kid," he added. "He's never been in trouble before."
According to Sussman, the statutory maximum of jail time, which Wheeler may receive if convicted, is five years for each felony count and one year for each misdemeanor. Wheeler has been charged with a total of 20 counts.
Wheeler waived rendition, which allows Mass. authorities to retrieve Wheeler from another state without undergoing interstate hearing procedures. He will be held on a $5,000 cash bail. If he makes his bail, the defendant must surrender his passport and cannot leave Massachusetts until his next court appearance on June 9.
In addition, if he makes bail, Wheeler must stay away from Harvard, Phillips Academy in Andover, Yale, Brown, and McLean Hospital—all locations that have been intertwined into his web of fabrications.
Since leaving Harvard, Wheeler allegedly applied to McLean Hospital in January for an internship, claiming that he was taking the spring semester off from the University to work on two scholarly books.
According to an official statement from McLean Hospital regarding the situation, Wheeler had applied for a student visitor program, but the hospital's standard verification process for applicants revealed that Wheeler had provided "fraudulent information regarding his credentials and student status at Harvard University."
“McLean immediately terminated Mr. Wheeler’s application and notified Harvard about his fraudulent use of the University’s name,” the statement said. “McLean cooperated fully with the Harvard University Police Department’s investigation and is appreciative of its swift action to prevent additional fraud.”
That same month, Wheeler allegedly submitted transfer applications to Yale and Brown with fraudulent documents that claimed the defendant was currently employed by McLean Hospital as an intern. He also allegedly turned in fake recommendations from a hospital employee named Laura Hsu, and from Kirkland House Resident Dean David A. Smith, who had originally informed the defendant of the plagiarism accusation, according to Verner.
When Wheeler's parents received a telephone call from the Yale admissions office regarding his transfer application, the parents forced Wheeler to reveal that his application was false and that he had been thrown out of Harvard, according to Verner.
“If it weren’t for his parents, Mr. Wheeler’s pathological behavior wouldn’t have stopped,” Verner said.
Wheeler's complex web of lies began to unravel when, as a senior at Harvard in September 2009, he submitted a resume, a Harvard transcript, and an essay to apply for the Rhodes and Fulbright Scholarships. During the application review process, English Professor W. James Simpson suspected that Wheeler had plagiarized the work of Professor Stephen Greenblatt, Verner said.
Upon being invited by Smith to defend himself at a disciplinary hearing convened by University officials, the defendant told Smith that he was going to leave Harvard instead, according to Verner.
During the investigation, members of the faculty discovered that the student had forged two letters of recommendation submitted in his application packet for the Rhodes. His fake transcript reflected 36 A’s and one A minus over three years, but further investigation revealed that Wheeler had in reality received a D, a few B’s, and a few A’s in his time at Harvard, according to Verner.
Wheeler’s prompt departure moved investigators to examine his admissions application as a transfer student to Harvard. Wheeler had claimed to be a graduate of Phillips Academy in Andover and a freshman transfer student from MIT, producing transcripts from both institutions—neither of which he had attended, according to Verner.
For his transfer application to Harvard College, Wheeler submitted five letters of recommendation—four of which Wheeler allegedly said were from MIT professors. But the four authors named were actually Bowdoin professors, who all stated that they had not written the recommendations, according to Verner.
Authorities found that Wheeler was actually a sophomore at Bowdoin College who had been suspended from the school for plagiarizing various essays in one of his classes, according to Verner. The college allowed Wheeler to finish his spring semester of 2007, but instead of accepting a one-semester suspension, he applied as a transfer student to Harvard.
In addition, Wheeler's application to Harvard allegedly included a document from the College Board stating that he had earned a perfect score of 1600 on his SATs, when, in fact, he received scores of 1160 and 1220 when he took the test in March and November of 2004.
Wheeler was a member of the Class of 2010 who transferred to Harvard at the beginning of his sophomore year and became a resident of Kirkland House. An English concentrator, he received a Hoopes Prize in the spring of 2009 for a project that he had completed during his junior year.
Wheeler's plagiarized Hoopes-winning project, entitled "The Mapping of an Ideological Demesne: Space, Place, and Text From More to Marvell," was nominated by Suparna Roychoudhury, a teaching fellow in the English department. The published copy of Wheeler's work has been removed from Lamont, according to Harvard University Archives.
Roychoudhury could not be reached for comment.
The defendant did not receive a Harvard degree, according to Jeff Neal, spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard paid President Drew G. Faust $822,011 in salary and benefits in 2008, according to an IRS filing released Monday.
Faust’s earnings included a base salary of $671,388, over $100,000 for a home in Cambridge, and other benefits. That represents a 6 percent raise from 2007, the year when Faust assumed the presidency. Her reported compensation that year did not include the cost of a house, but did account for an $80,000 moving allowance.
Faust’s salary comes in well below those of some of her Ivy League peers. In 2007, Columbia President Lee C. Bollinger made $1.38 million, while University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann '71 made $1.23 million, according to a study conducted by the Chronicle of Higher Education.
Faust’s compensation is also dwarfed by that of several Harvard Management Company employees, of whom the highest paid took home more than $6.3 million in 2008. HMC reported pay data for 2008 yesterday that it had already released, citing a change in IRS rules that required reporting by calendar rather than fiscal year.
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers earned $648,825 in 2008, when he served as an economics professor. That sum included a $62,640 severance payment, the filing indicates.
Among Harvard's most highly paid faculty members were professors who accepted the University's retirement incentive package.  Harvard Business School professor William E. Fruhan received $1,182,420, including $720,000 of retirement incentives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To hear him tell it, Adam B. Wheeler has authored books, delivered lectures, and blazed through academia, grabbing one accolade after another along the way. But to those who knew him, Wheeler was a quiet and private student who just wanted to study English.
And yet, the multifaceted portrait does not end there: Prosecutors are now depicting the former Harvard student as a compulsive—perhaps even pathological—mastermind who built his academic history on a thick stack of lies.
Wheeler, 23, pled not guilty on Tuesday to 20 charges including larceny and identity fraud, following the revelation that various personal documents submitted for college, internship, and scholarship applications were all allegedly part of a “life of lies and deceit,” as described by Assistant District Attorney John C. Verner.
Those who knew Wheeler in the past said in interviews with The Crimson that he kept his personal life discreet, rarely drawing attention to himself in conversation.
“He was a good guy who didn’t talk about his academics or his life history much, but he came off as very smart,” a source close to Wheeler, who did not wish to be named, said in an interview Monday. “We just allowed him his privacy.”
One Harvard graduate said that Wheeler was “a really, really quiet guy. He very much...kept to himself. He seemed really nice.”
“He was quite clearly interested in English from the day he showed up,” the individual added.
Wheeler’s penchant for words is made apparent in an e-mail laden with thesaurus-worthy words that he sent to his fellow incoming transfer students at Harvard in September 2007.
“My own, brief, assessment of my character is that I am sententious, crypto-tendentious, slightly pedantic with a streak of contrarianism, a fascination with any pedagogical approach to Shakespeare, and a decent sense of humor,” Wheeler wrote in the e-mail, which The Crimson obtained from a recipient of the message.
Wheeler wrote that he was not a fan of sports, calling them “a neighborhood faux-pas of epic proportions,” and that he planned to study the humanities at Harvard.
In the e-mailed message, Wheeler expressed his plans to study English at Harvard, since he had not experienced the support for humanities that he so desired at MIT, where he said he had spent his first undergraduate year—contradicting prosecutors’ allegations that Wheeler actually had studied at the liberal arts college Bowdoin in Maine for two years before being suspended for academic dishonesty.
“[At MIT], I was, to put it poorly, suckled upon the teat of disdain. That being said (fortified by a reflexive snort), I was inspired therby [sic] to apply to Harvard, where the humanities, in short, are not, simpliciter, a source of opprobrium,” Wheeler wrote.
The news of his fraudulent activities came as a particular shock to the Caesar Rodney High School community due to the seeming disparity between Adam Wheeler the alleged criminal and the Adam Wheeler who quietly attended the school as a normal, but bright, student.
“He seemed to have a lot of potential and ability, so, from our perspective, this is a shock that a young man with such promise would end up doing these things,” said Kevin Fitzgerald, who was the principal of Caesar Rodney during the time of Wheeler’s attendance and is now the superintendent of the school district. “What went wrong that happened in his life to lead him to try to fool so many people? What makes a person do what he did?”
“I don’t know if any of us have the answer,” he added. “I don’t know if he even has the answer.”
During his time at Caesar Rodney High School in Camden, Del., Wheeler was a member of the National Honor Society, earned himself a place in the top 10 percent of his class, and participated in the school’s marching band.
“He was a typical high school student, we’d say,” Fitzgerald said. “He was a good student. He fit in and had friends, but he didn’t do anything that really drew any attention to himself.”
Once Wheeler gained acceptance to Bowdoin College and graduated from Caesar Rodney in 2005, the school “kind of lost track of him,” Fitzgerald said. But in late April of this year, the former student’s name snuck back onto the radar: the high school received an inquiry from an admissions officer at Yale, who asked Caesar Rodney to verify data on Wheeler’s transfer application.
Red flags quickly appeared. Wheeler’s forms stated that he had graduated as valedictorian in 2007—clearly false, Fitzgerald said, since Wheeler did not rank first in his class and had graduated in the year 2005.
Wheeler’s application also listed Advanced Placement courses that had not been offered at Caesar Rodney during Wheeler’s time at the school and showcased perfect SAT scores. According to prosecutors, Wheeler took the SAT twice, achieving scores of 1160 and 1220.
“There was a series of e-mails that went back and forth that basically said, ‘No, these are not correct,’ and from that point, it became more complicated,” said Fitzgerald, who added that Caesar Rodney’s involvement in the Wheeler case did not extend beyond the school’s interactions with Yale. “The flags went up because, ‘Hey, there’s a problem here. This guy is trying to get away with something that’s wrong.’”
Fitzgerald said he believes that the Yale admissions office did not contact Caesar Rodney in April out of suspicion regarding the authenticity of Wheeler’s application, but to conduct a standard vetting procedure of applicants. But with the emergence of the various warning signs, the Yale admissions office contacted its counterpart at Harvard, which Wheeler had left in the fall of 2009 when faced with charges of academic dishonesty.
During his time in high school, there had been “no indication” that Wheeler had committed any form of academic dishonesty or fraud, Fitzgerald said. In fact, when the high school began to learn of the inconsistencies between the claims made in Wheeler’s transfer application and his actual time in high school, the initial concern on the minds of administrators at Caesar Rodney was the possibility that Wheeler was a victim of identity theft.
“That was our first reaction, that the Adam Wheeler that we’re seeing on this application does not fit the Adam Wheeler that we knew when he was in high school,” Fitzgerald said. It was only after the application had gone through a verification process that the high school “confirmed that that was our Adam Wheeler…It really seemed out of character for him.”
“He seems like a different person,” Fitzgerald added. “It’s just a sad case because who knows what demons drive individuals and what pressures he felt, and why in the world he tried to perpetrate the frauds that he did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 11:27 a.m.
A closer examination of a resume drafted by former Harvard student Adam B. Wheeler reveals inconsistencies in line with recent charges that he submitted fraudulent applications to a slew of institutions.
On Tuesday, the New Republic—a news magazine based in Washington, D.C.—posted on its blog that it too had received an application from Wheeler, who had applied for an internship earlier in 2010 after he had been dismissed from Harvard for academic dishonesty.
The New Republic, which ultimately turned Wheeler down, also posted a copy of the resume that Wheeler had submitted.
The resume stated that Wheeler had a 4.0 GPA at Harvard, in contrast to prosecutors' claim that he received some A’s, some B’s, and a D in his Harvard classes. The resume also stated that Wheeler began attending Harvard in 2006, though he actually matriculated in 2007.
On the document, Wheeler called himself the "co-author" of four books with English Professor Marc Shell that are either under contract or under review with several major university presses. Willis G. Regier, director of University of Illinois Press, said in an interview Wednesday that "Wampum and the Origins of American Money" is indeed under contract with UIP, but Shell is the only name listed on the contract for the work.
"I had no knowledge of [Wheeler's] involvement whatsoever in the project," said Regier, who is the editor of the book and added that the project has been ongoing for years.
Wheeler also listed himself as the co-author of a book under contract and another project under review with McGill-Queen's University Press. But the press' marketing director Susan McIntosh said that Wheeler "is completely unknown to us," and that his name would be on a contract if he was a co-author for a project.
Representatives from Princeton University Press—another place that Wheeler listed on his resume—declined to comment on Wednesday.
None of the three lectures Wheeler claimed to have delivered at the National Association of Armenian Studies and Research at Harvard are included on the organization’s online list of past events, except one which is attributed to Harvard Professor James R. Russell, not Wheeler.
Wheeler also claimed to have served as a writing tutor in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, a position which Department Chair Wilt Idema said does not even exist.
Wheeler also has never worked as a writing tutor at the Harvard Extension School Writing Center as his resume claimed, according to Jeannine Johnson, director of the Writing Center.
Wheeler’s resume did not mention undergraduate work at either MIT—where he claimed in his Harvard transfer admission application to have attended—or Bowdoin, where prosecutors said he spent his first two undergraduate years.
The resume concluded with the assertion that Wheeler speaks French, Old English, Classical Armenian, and Old Persian.
Wheeler pled not guilty Tuesday morning to 20 counts including larceny and identity fraud. Middlesex County prosecutors charge that he submitted plagiarized letters of recommendations, fake transcripts, and fraudulent SAT scores in his application to Harvard and to several other scholarships and programs.
Representatives at The New Republic declined to comment Tuesday afternoon.

For most seniors on the Harvard men’s volleyball team, the last game of their careers will be the Crimson’s disappointing 3-1 loss to NJIT this past April.
But co-captain Erik Kuld is hoping to write a different ending to his career next year when the 6’1” outside hitter teams up with Brady Weissbourd ’09 to play professionally in Europe.
The two powerful attackers hope to transfer their skills on the hardwood to the sand, as the duo plans to participate in beach volleyball tournaments throughout the continent in hopes of taking home cash prizes.
“Hopefully we will do well enough to make ends meet,” Kuld said. “I’m excited for it for sure.”
Kuld concluded his collegiate career with a strong season, leading his team with 322 kills and 142 digs.
“[Kuld’s] work ethic is just unmatched,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “I think he can achieve just about anything if he wants.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crews traveled to Worcester, Mass. this past weekend to compete at the EARC Eastern Sprints. Competition took place on Sunday at the six-lane Lake Quinsigamond course with heats in the morning followed by finals in the afternoon. The Crimson heavies walked away team champions having won the varsity and freshman eight events. Meanwhile, the Harvard lightweights saw the end to a thus-far perfect season for the varsity and first freshman boats, leaving them anxious for another racing opportunity at IRAs.
The Crimson heavyweight varsity entered the regatta seeded second in the league to the Brown Bears and ranked fourth nationally. The grand final Sunday afternoon was a three-boat race between Harvard, Brown, and the Princeton boat that did not finish its dual race against the Crimson earlier this season after a mid-race collision.
“We were focused on Brown, but with Princeton, although we felt like the race had been under control, we never knew what had been going to happen in that second 1,000,” said junior two seat Anthony Locke. “And they’re a really good program, so it wasn’t too surprising that they got right back up there and put up a strong race.”
Harvard, racing in lane three, led off of the start and maintained an advantage of only a couple of seats through the 1,000-meter mark. The crew extended their lead in the third 500 meters, taking nearly a full length off of a surge move. The Crimson held off the Bears and Tigers through the final 500 meters, including the sprint, to win by a two-and-a-half second margin in a time of 5:33.0 to Princeton’s 5:35.5 and Brown’s 5:36.9.
“We had a pretty good start that put us in a good position on Brown and Princeton and the other crews,” sophomore stroke Pat Lapage said. “We worked it in the third 500 quite a bit and started to take control of the race and then in the last 500 pulled it away a little bit again. It was a good race.”
The gold-medal varsity eight consisted of senior coxswain Kelly Evans and oarsmen Lapage, sophomores Matt Edstein and Nick Jordan, junior David Wakulich, sophomores Sam O'Connor and Michael DiSanto, Locke, and captain Blake Pucsek.
All Harvard boats won their morning heats on Sunday and went on to compete in the grand finals that afternoon. Aside from the varsity eight, the freshman four, fourth varsity eight and first freshman eight took home gold medals this weekend.
In the first freshman eight event, the Crimson was in a three-way battle with Princeton and Cornell. The Tigers and Harvard pulled away from the Big Red moving into the final 500 meters of the race. Princeton pushed its bow ball out to a slight advantage with only two or three hundred meters until the finish line. The Crimson countered with a strong and precise sprint that walked it up a few seats in the final strokes to win by half a second in a time of 5:37.2 to Princeton’s 5:37.7.
The Harvard second varsity finished just out of the medals, placing fourth in the grand final. The third varsity eight was able to secure bronze, finishing less than a second behind Brown and about three seconds behind Wisconsin.
The Crimson claimed its 30th Rowe Cup and its sixth team championship in the past nine years. The varsity eight and first freshman eight also earned trips to the Henley Royal Regatta in England with their victories, but first, the team has the Harvard-Yale Regatta and IRAs to look forward to.
For the Harvard lightweights, also competing at Lake Quinsigamond this past Saturday, the results—though impressive—were disappointing after a spectacular dual racing season that saw both the varsity and first freshman squads go undefeated.
In the varsity event, the Crimson eight was in a three-boat race with Yale and Princeton. The event was a repeat of the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Regatta from only two weekends ago, but this time, Harvard fell short to the Tigers.
Just as in the previous race, the Tigers jumped out to an early advantage. This time though, they took three or four more seats on the Crimson, gaining almost a full-length advantage. The lead proved too much for the Harvard oarsmen to overcome. The Crimson finished 2.3 seconds behind Princeton in a time of 5:43.4.
“Princeton went off the line very quickly and we were able to hold them,” said captain and varsity five seat Martin Eiermann. “But they just managed to get that extra two or three seats going to the 1,000-meter mark, which is just enough that the crew that is lagging behind has a harder time coming back because you’re losing them in your peripheral vision.”
Harvard’s second varsity eight finished just out of the top three in its event, 1.8 seconds behind third-place Cornell. The Crimson third varsity and second freshman eight took second in their events, as did the first freshman eight in what was a battle to the finish line.
Harvard’s first freshman eight, which went undefeated in the dual racing season, fell to the third-seeded Big Red by only a bow-ball. The two eights paced each other down the course, with the rest of the field trailing them in a tight pack of their own. In the end, Cornell edged out Harvard by less than 0.4 seconds. The Big Red finished in 5:48.4 to the Crimson’s 5:48.7.
Overall, Harvard placed second to Princeton in the team competition by a mere five points. Without a doubt, the rivalry between the two Ivy League powerhouses will continue at IRAs in Camden, N.J. in two weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe lightweight and heavyweight crews fulfilled some expectations yet faltered on others this weekend in one of their biggest competitions of the year at this weekend’s Eastern Association of Women’s Rowing Colleges Sprints Championships.
“Everyone’s excited going into sprints,” heavyweight co-captain Christine Baugh said. “We recognized the level of competition we were about to face.”
The races, which were held this past Sunday on the Cooper River in Camden, N.J., marked the last competition for the heavyweights, while the lightweights will race again next month.
HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. EAWRC SPRINTS
The Black and White varsity eight failed to qualify for the grand final but redeemed itself later in the day, while the other heavyweight boats produced mixed results in their own heats and finals.
The varsity eight came in third in its morning heat behind Brown and Dartmouth, and although it missed making the grand final by just over seven seconds, it won the top spot in its next race.
“Our race in our heat was pretty disappointing, but we were really proud of the way people recovered, gathered together, and fought to victory in the petite final,” Baugh said. “It may not have been the grand final, but it was our grand final.”
The Radcliffe varsity eight upset both Northeastern and Columbia to win the petite final, and Yale went on to narrowly win the grand final.
The Black and White second varsity eight edged out Northeastern for a spot in its grand final but ended up finishing sixth out of six.
The Radcliffe varsity four had the best finish out of all of the heavyweight boats getting second in its heat and fifth in a very close grand final. The four teams in the middle of the pack were distanced by a total of just over four seconds, but the Black and White finished more than 16 seconds ahead of sixth-place Boston University.
Both the varsity four B and the third varsity eight made it to their petite finals where they took second behind Bucknell and Yale, respectively.
“Every boat regrouped and fought [its] way back with every stroke,” Baugh said. “It’s the sign of a true competitor.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. EAWRC SPRINTS
Radcliffe lightweight crew continued its season’s success with all four boats placing in the top three—a goal the Black and White had set out to achieve from the very beginning of the year and a feat that no other lightweight squad at Sunday’s competition was able to accomplish.
“We wanted all of our girls to come back with medals, and the fact that we were able to do that really shows a lot of depth in our program,” lightweight co-captain Grace Hollowell said.
The varsity eight took third in the grand final just over two seconds ahead of Georgetown, breaking its three-year streak of fourth-place finishes at Sprints.
The Black and White second varsity eight and varsity four both came out with silver medals after close finishes. The second varsity eight was less than six seconds behind winner Wisconsin, a considerable improvement after the last meeting with the between Radcliffe and the Badgers.
The novice eight also finished second in its field of three. Although Wisconsin dominated by a margin of almost 34 seconds, the Black and White beat out Princeton by another 20 seconds.
“It was a great building point, and hopefully next year we’ll be able to turn those bronzes and silvers into golds,” Hollowell said. “It’s great motivation because some other teams still finished ahead of us, but we’re going to keep working until we’re first seed and we’re the ones being chased.”
The Radcliffe heavyweights missed qualifying for the NCAA Championships, but the lightweights will compete next at the IRA National Championships, also in Camden, N.J., on June 3-5.

Are your parents concerned about the limited hotel space during Commencement? The Charles Hotel Commencement Club offers an opportunity for Harvard parents to reserve rooms in advance.
Parents of any Harvard student (not just freshmen) are eligible to join the club. Once members have stayed at the hotel for 20 nights, they have the privilege of booking up to two rooms for their child's Commencement three weeks before non-members, who are not allowed to book rooms earlier than one year in advance.
So, that means members who want to reserve for the Class of 2011's Commencement could have done so starting last Thursday, while the general public will not be able to until the week after the Class of 2010's Commencement.
This way, parents are guaranteed a room during one of the busiest times of the year, when the Charles Hotel has to accommodate thousands of requests for a limited 294 rooms.
Other perks of membership include discounted suite upgrades, dining credits, and tickets to the Regattabar at the Harvard Square, depending on the number of nights accumulated.
According to Director of Sales and Marketing Jennifer MaMahon, the four-year-old program is well received by Harvard parents: its membership varies from 75 to 90 year from year. (Only 100 are allowed in any given year.)
So the good news is that if a freshman plans for Commencement early enough (four years ahead of time seems like a good amount...or maybe even before the acceptance letter arrives?), when the time comes, his parents will be guaranteed a space at the Charles Hotel. It's one less thing to worry about, right?

Contrary to popular belief, "Securitas" is not a portmanteau of "security" and "veritas," but rather the name of the multinational corporation subcontracted by Harvard for campus security. Despite this fact, we here at FlyBy find the word "Securitas" to be so hilarious that we've decided to name a new series after it. Every week, we'll offer up amusing (and sometimes absurd) HUPD daily log entries. Take a look!

This week, we asked graduating seniors to answer four different questions about their Harvard experiences: yesterday, we inquired about their regrets. Here's the second installment of their reflections.
Twenty years from now, what will you remember most about your college experience?
"The long nights, in both a good and bad sense."
Daniel D. B. Koll '10
"All the House events, winning the Straus cup, hanging out with people."
Michael B. Kaehler '10
"Large bowls of punch, amazing blockmates, losing my clothes at my own parties, and a fabulous education."
Amol K. Jain '10
"The people I met! It's so true. Harvard's full of really interesting, awesome people."
Natasa Kovacevic '10
"Being in Glee Club. And my roommates."
Miles W. Canaday '10
"Forties Thursdays."
Anne G. Montgomery '10
"Hungover brunch at Annenberg, winter formals at the Westin and the Harvard Club, dinners in Leverett with the blockmates, of course Eleganza and the Eleganza family."
Nicholas J. Navarro '10
"The Lowell bells."

“We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam, and you exemplify it," said Connecticut Attorney General Richard D. Blumenthal '67, a former Crimson Editorial Chairman, in a speech delivered to veterans and senior citizens in March 2008. The Norwalk, Connecticut audience did not immediately react to Blumenthal's assertions concerning Vietnam, but as the New York Times reports, "there was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam."
According to the Times, Blumenthal's military service records indicate that he received a total of at least five military deferments in the period from 1965 to 1970, including at least two while he was a student at the College.
Subsequent deferments allowed Blumenthal to pursue a Fiske Scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, work for the publisher of the Washington Post (whose son he had befriended during his time at the College), and work in the Nixon White House.
Blumenthal later joined the Marine Corps Reserve, which, according to the Times, "was regarded as a safe harbor for those who did not want to go to war." While enlisted in the Reserve, Blumenthal earned his J.D. from Yale Law School and clerked for Supreme Court Associate Justice Harry A. Blackmun '29.
But there's more: a Slate magazine article dating from 2000 (with which Blumenthal cooperated) reports that Blumenthal served as captain of the swim team during his time at the College—except, as the Times reports, Blumenthal wasn't on the swim team and made no effort to correct Slate's erroneous claim.
Mindy Myers, Blumenthal's campaign manager, denied the allegations in a written statement released this morning. "The New York Times story is an outrageous distortion of Dick Blumenthal's record of service. Unlike many of his peers, Dick Blumenthal voluntarily joined the Marine Corps Reserves in 1970 and served for six months in Parris Island, SC, and six years in the reserves," she wrote.
This afternoon, Blumenthal himself responded to the allegations that he misrepresented his military service in a press conference. "On a few occasions I have misspoken about my service, and I regret that and I take full responsibility," Blumenthal said, "but I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to our country.”
