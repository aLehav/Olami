After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nineteen years ago, on October 17th, 2002, at 8:47 a.m, I was brought into this world. Smiling and wide-eyed, I didn’t even cry as I was pushed out of my mother’s womb into the waiting hands of the doctors surrounding her.
Little did I know the incredulous odds of my ascension into this world.
About two years earlier, when my mother was 19, she became pregnant with my older sibling. Being 19 years old, how could she have possibly been expected to give up the rest of her life to raise and provide for a child?
So she had an abortion. And then two years later, she was pregnant again — except this time, it was with me.
Some might argue that this piece of my life should install me as an avid ally of the pro-life movement.
But as the one who survived, I am still pro-choice.
I am now the very age my mother was when she first got pregnant. As my mother’s daughter, I am now acutely aware of just how vulnerable being young and pregnant made her. Even now that I have achieved my life’s greatest success in making it to Harvard, and gained so many invaluable life lessons throughout my time here, I still do not feel anywhere near mature enough to allow myself to carry a baby to full term. And as a victim of sexual assault, I can only imagine what it would’ve been like had I been impregnated and forced to carry that forced baby.
The decision I make every day to wake up and choose to support those who have abortions is a deliberate, intentional one. The fact that I am able to make this decision every day undoubtedly relies on how my mother decided to carry me to term — but even if she had not, there would have been many others in the world making the same decision every day in my absence.
As the child who lived, I am comfortable with the knowledge that I might not have. My contribution to this earth is not yet complete — but any such contribution I have made has not been and will not be unique. The crux of the abortion debate is not battling between ideologies of pro-life and pro-choice, but rather failing to understand that our places within this world could have easily been fulfilled by another mind. Another child would have been born on my exact birthdate, made it into Harvard, and contributed something else to society in my vacancy.
Knowing the outlook for little girls and women across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned has only strengthened my resolve in my decision. Had I been the product of rape or incest, or had my fetal stage been killing my mother, I would not want to be here today. I would not want to be the source of my mother’s continued grief. I would not want to experience my mother’s residual psychological damage from being forced to carry me after being sexually assaulted. I would not want to live with potential abnormalities or chronic illnesses that would drastically diminish my quality of life, had I been a product of incest.
My mother’s mental health would and should always come before the “what if” of my supposed success, defined by men who will never know the gravity of these situations. That is what love is: to make the sacrifice of one’s own life in order to see the ones you love be happy.
I know that my mother was ready to become a mom and raise me properly to become the successful person I am today. I am the product of her having a choice to do so. When that choice is stripped away, when women who didn’t want to be mothers are forced to raise children, they cannot put in the effort to raise a child properly. Or worse, young mothers take the decision into their own hands and try dangerous methods of abortion that lead them to kill, scar, and emotionally damage themselves.
As my mother’s daughter, I would’ve wanted her to decide to have me. As my mother’s daughter, I would’ve wanted her pregnancy with me to have been safe and filled with love and excitement. As my mother’s daughter, I thank her for having me, but do not burden her with the what if’s of my older sibling.
As the daughter who got to live, I am still pro-choice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates are set to reopen Quad Bikes, a bicycle repair shop nested in the basement of Cabot House, after a roughly two-year closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Quad Bikes, a non-profit founded in 2003 by two Cabot undergraduates, offered refurbished bicycles, affordable repair services, and bike maintenance classes to Harvard students and Cambridge residents. Though the shop used Harvard’s space rent-free, it operated as a business independent from the University.
Tim D. Ledlie ’02, who founded the shop alongside Juan C. Agudelo ’03, said Quad Bikes was an “invaluable resource,” servicing thousands of bikes and providing an “approachable” environment for questions on all things cycling.
“We all really believe that having robust services and support for bike stuff on campus is a really important thing,” said Ledlie, who stepped away from operating Quad Bikes in 2006. “It seems to have been a very helpful thing to the Harvard community over the past 18 years.”
But as campus life shuttered during Covid-19, Quad Bikes halted its operations. When campus roared back to life but the shop stayed closed, Cabot senior Everett C. Sapp ’23 began reaching out to administrators about its reopening.
“There was still the same sign on it from, I think, March of 2020, which was like, ‘We’ll be back soon,’” Sapp said. “At the same time, I started to notice a bunch of my friends around campus having really small issues with their bikes and then not being able to get that taken care of, and then they would end up just having to park their bikes.”
Sapp said he aims to “hit the ground running” when students return to campus this fall by cleaning the space and servicing bikes.
“My goal moving forward is to eventually create something that lasts sustainably throughout the years,” he said.
Sapp said that several other undergraduates, including his roommate, have already volunteered to help reopen the shop.
Nathaniel Hoyt, a former mechanic and later a shop manager at Quad Bikes, took on the job in 2012 while studying at the Harvard Extension School. Hoyt described his seven years at the shop as “the best job I ever had” and said he has been actively involved in the revival effort.
“We aren’t sure yet what sort of form it’s going to take when it does reopen,” Hoyt said. “But the shop is still there. The tools are all still there. The only thing that we really need are just people who have that same goal as we did and have the time and energy to spare to open it.”
Ledlie said Quad Bikes, which will continue to operate in Cabot’s basement, “wouldn’t exist” without the support of the College administration.
“All of the faculty deans — I think there have been four of them in the history of Quad Bikes — have been instrumental to its existence and and been very supportive of it,” he said.
Cabot Faculty Dean Ian J. Miller wrote in a statement to The Crimson that he and co-dean Crate Herbert are “big fans” of the effort to revive the shop.
“Cabot is really eager and excited to re-start Quad Bikes and to support student leaders who are working to make that happen," Miller wrote. "This is a student-led institution, and we’re proud to support it."
Ledlie said he hopes Quad Bikes can smoothly return to campus, citing the positive and lasting influence of bicycles on Harvard and its surroundings.
“It’s an important thing for the Harvard community, specifically with all of the transportation and sustainability needs of the campus, but also more broadly in the world,” Ledlie said. “The world would be greener and more healthy and more efficient and less wasteful if there were more people riding, understanding, and appreciating bikes.”

An off-duty Cambridge Police officer was arrested Monday morning for driving while intoxicated following a crash with three motorcyclists.
The officer, Michael A. Daniliuk, allegedly drove through a red light and struck three motorcyclists at the intersection of Columbia and Broadway. He has been charged with driving under the influence and failing to stop at a red light, according to a CPD press release.
Daniliuk, who serves as a youth resource officer and has worked for CPD for more than two decades, has been placed on administrative leave while the case is pending.
No one involved in the accident sustained apparent major injuries, according to the press release, though Daniliuk and two of the motorcyclists were taken to local hospitals.
Daniliuk pled not guilty during his arraignment in Cambridge District Court on Monday. He was released on personal recognizance by the judge and is set to return to court on Oct. 19.
Officers testified at the arraignment that Daniliuk refused a field sobriety test at the scene of the accident and smelled strongly of alcohol, according to local news outlets WCVB-TV and 7News Boston.
Daniliuk did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of Harvard freshmen crowded into Tercentenary Theatre Tuesday afternoon for the College’s annual Convocation, which featured an address by University President Lawrence S. Bacow and a protest by the Palestine Solidarity Committee.
The ceremony, which welcomed 1,649 freshmen to the College, also included remarks from College Dean Rakesh Khurana and other top Harvard administrators. During the program, musical performances by the Kuumba Singers, Harvard choruses, and the Harvard University Band resonated through the Yard.
In his speech, Bacow — who will step down in June 2023 — advised freshmen to pursue truth by engaging with different perspectives.
“Our motto is ‘veritas,’ and it’s more than a motto. It’s the reason we exist, to seek the truth. But truth needs to be tested, needs to be revealed. And that can only happen on the anvil of competing ideas,” Bacow said. “It’s really, really important to engage with people who think differently from you.”
Khurana called on students in his address to take up the challenge of seeking truth even when it is difficult.
“Some of the most powerful obstacles to searching for the truth actually come from within us. One of these obstacles is the temptation to conform,” Khurana said. “The forces of conformity can be strong and work against our ability to seek answers to tough questions.”
“We need to ask those questions,” he added.
Following Khurana’s address, a group of student protesters from the Palestine Solidarity Committee chanted and displayed a poster that read, “Veritas? Here’s the real truth: Harvard Supports Israeli Apartheid.” Several protesters were stationed next to the freshmen throughout the ceremony.
College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo declined to comment on the protest.
Harvard Hillel Executive Director Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg criticized the display as “anti-Israel” and “anti-Harvard” in an email to Hillel members Tuesday afternoon.
“Beyond being unfortunate, such a display is also inadvertently ironic and terribly counterproductive,” Steinberg wrote. “Perhaps the best use one may make of such a moment is to lift up — by contrast to what we have just seen in the Yard — the nuance and the depth available to Harvard students through the programs of Harvard Hillel.”
In a statement to The Crimson following the protest and Hillel’s email, PSC member Joshua D. Willcox ’24 wrote that there is “no right time and place” to protest.
“We believe that we have the responsibility to leverage our education to hold Harvard accountable and condemn the oppression that it is actively involved in, especially when these actions are so contradictory to the values that the administration purports,” the statement read.
The ceremony also included an address from Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, who used viral online game Wordle as an analogy for students’ transition to life at Harvard.
“I am not embarrassed to say that most of the time I am perfectly average at Wordle. But just like in life, I have my days of excellence and my days of frustration,” O’Dair said. “I ask that you grant yourself some grace when you don’t get everything absolutely right the first time.”
Many students in the College’s Class of 2026 said they enjoyed their Convocation, which marks their official start as Harvard undergraduates.
“Hearing the band for the first time, seeing all the choruses — I didn’t realize a lot of how amazing the organizations here are,” Eileen K. Ye ’26 said. “It’s really sinking in that we’re here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Business School rolled out a new financial aid program earlier this month that covers the full cost of tuition for about 10 percent of its MBA students.
The scholarships provides $76,000 per year to its recipients, covering tuition and course fees. Students who receive the aid are still responsible for living expenses.
“Harvard Business School should be a place where the most talented future leaders can come to realize their potential,” Business School Dean Srikant M. Datar said in the Aug. 16 press release announcing the move. “We want to remove the financial barriers that stand in their way and alleviate the burden of debt so they can focus on becoming leaders who make a difference in the world.”
The aid increase comes after a handful of other changes in recent years that the school says are aimed at attracting students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. HBS has expanded the number of need-based scholarships it offers, revised its financial aid formula to account for socioeconomic background, and instituted an application fee waiver. In 2018, the school launched the Forward Fellowship, which offers funding to students who financially support family members during business school.
Need-based aid assessments are made through a formula that considers pre-MBA income and assets, socioeconomic background, and debt. Currently, 50 percent of MBA students at the school receive scholarships.
The school said in its announcement that it is also offering new scholarships to previously ineligible middle-income students.
HBS’s annual budget for MBA financial aid exceeds $45 million, according to the press release.
The aid increase came after a committee was convened in 2018 “to better understand the barriers that keep potential applicants from applying,” according to a Q&A with HBS’s managing director of MBA Admissions and Financial Aid, Chad I. Losee, posted by the school. The group included Dtar and former HBS Dean Nitin Nohria.
The changes are already in effect, impacting students in the Classes of 2023 and 2024.

Icebreakers — sorry, just the word gives me ~flashbacks~ to yesterday, sitting in a circle telling everyone my favorite color is purple. While it’s still icebreaker season, let me save you from the traumatic, anticlimactic experience of telling strangers dull facts about yourself that no one asked for. I got you with the perfect life hacks for thinking of conversation starting **fun** facts.
Offer a Hot Take 
Nothing says conversation starter like a friendly debate, buttt be careful of how much you push this one. You want to entertain the group with a humorous argument, not create a lifelong enemy in your crack of dawn at 9 a.m. because they’re a Jefe’s stan and you're not.
Complain
OK, this might seem like the easy way out. But hear me out: complaints are relatable! Let’s face it, we all bond over complaining about endless p-sets and HUDS’s not so flavorful food, so why not start the ~bonding~ over grievances early?? Instead of sending that long text message rant to your best friends, perhaps you could instead share the rage with sleep-derived strangers who you met two minutes ago.
Share What Makes You *Special*
Do you speak multiple languages? Do you have a SoundCloud? Are you secretly an FBI agent???? Well, maybe don’t share that. But, simply just share what makes you, you. This can be as artificial as you want it to be, or as genuine as you’re willing to share. People could remember you as the “one who can eat a Felipe’s burrito in 5.6 seconds,” instead of the “one who has two dogs.”
Be a Copy-Cat
The goal of an icebreaker is to make friends right? Build off someone’s story of how they were featured on Shark Tank, or how they met Bill Gates. Having things in common is the foundation of friendship, so nothing says friendship like having the same brand. Speaking of branding, psychology says that people tend to like themselves *so* much that they’re attracted to the mere image of themselves. Don't steal their identity, but definitely match their ~wavelengths~. They might end up subconsciously despising you for coming for their clout, or you might just trick them into becoming friends!!
Confess your Love
Are you obsessed with Playa Bowls? Were you in the top 1 percent of Taylor Swift’s 2021 Spotify listeners? Use this as your chance to write a love letter to your favorite coffee shop, band, or even everyone’s favorite pharmacy right down the street. Your new classmates might think you’re a little obsessive (in a not so healthy way), but at least you have a personality!
Remember these five categories, and you’ll never be overwhelmed with the unbearable embarrassment your mediocre fun fact has brought you during the first few weeks of classes. Everyone will think you’re ~that~ person after they hear your fun fact, but little do they know you just have amazing taste in blogs ;)
