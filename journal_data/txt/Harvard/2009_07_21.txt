After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I read Hong Kong Rose a few weeks ago, I recognized the places around the island that Xu Xi wrote about in her novel of transatlantic love, lust, and searching. Seeing it in fiction made Hong Kong more compelling to me and, paradoxically, more real.
Barely speaking basic Cantonese or reading traditional Chinese characters lends imagined elements to everyday interactions. Is the bored-looking girl behind the counter at 7-11 laughing at my question, or the joke her co-worker just told? Does the hostess detect the annoyance slipping into my voice when I ask her a third time for the address of the restaurant? What are the ads with women in bikinis selling–skin cream or cosmetic surgery? 
Familiar strangers turn into characters in my mental summer narrative. There’s the tough guy with a reddish brown ponytail climbing the subway stairs. A week later, again wearing a denim shirt and jeans, he gently leads a lady down King’s Road. Every morning the woman in an orange vest grins around sticking-out teeth, blithely handing out free newspapers. There is a man with a two and a half foot beard selling novels on Lamma Island. A shopkeeper in front of my apartment explains how her dresses can also be skirts. The squat blond ex-pat led by four Pomeranians on leashes crosses the bridge where the man with an egg-shaped back leans against the railing, looking over the harbor, as he does every afternoon starting around 6:15 p.m.  
And all of us cross the streets where the crosswalk symbol ticks slowly for red and fast for green. This ticking, the throngs pouring out of the subway exits, the escalators with the looping announcement in Cantonese, then Mandarin, then English—“Please hold the handrail” —combine to create the quintessential Hong Kong commute. The fan-wielding dancers under the park shelter, the fishermen holding rods in the downpour, the old woman shaking a metal bowl across from city hall and telling me to get out of the rain, show me that life goes on, even during typhoons.  
Does living with a linguistic veil and a heightened interest in detail involve more fictionalizing than processing events at home? Doesn’t retrospection add ambiguity, even to conversations that didn’t have a language barrier? Aren’t we in the habit of corralling observations into metaphors, even when we aren’t trying to discover the rhythm of a foreign place? Don’t we simplify un-mined personalities of even the people we know until they’re stock characters for our unwritten autobiographies?

WASHINGTON, D.C.—Due to the infinite wisdom I have gleaned from the past five and a half weeks here, I have come to find that many a life lesson can be drawn from the comedy “Arrested Development.” (A disclaimer: This might also be a result of the fact that I recently re-watched all three seasons.) If you’ve never experienced the glory of this show, read no further and go do it now. Not kidding, you’re missing out. And eliminating any possibility that we could ever be friends. Also, you won’t get any of these references. 
In case you decided to read anyway, a bit of exposition As the show’s intro explains, it is “the story of a wealthy family” (the dysfunctional Bluths) “who lost everything and the one son” (Michael) “who had no choice but to keep them all”—his parents (George Sr. and Lucille), son (George Michael), siblings (Gob, Linsday, and Buster), brother-in-law (Tobias), and niece (Maebe)—“together.” 
Anyway, on to the point. More often than not, I tend toward a George Michael, a little bit too worried and, let’s face it, pretty awkward. I would prefer for things to run on schedule and for them to go smoothly and without real conflict. And when they don’t, I experience the perpetual urge to want to fix them. So, how to move from this state of preoccupation to idyllic summer (and if we want to be ambitious, lifelong) happiness? 
Perhaps, you say, it would be better to be a Lindsay, who seems perfectly content spending her days oblivious to complication—going shopping and making hot ham water. But I don’t so much have the clothes or the hair to pull that off. And being married to Tobias could get a little awkies. Or maybe a Lucille or George Sr., who can simply will (or hire a one-armed man to help coerce) what they want done. Seems to work out fairly well for them, but I guess I’m still a little young to be quite that bitter. There’s always the option of pulling a Buster and faking a coma to escape from it all, but I suspect that real doctors might be slightly more competent than the ones on the show. 
So here I sit, mulling over my time in our nation’s capital. Thus far, D.C. has seen the worst Metro disaster in its history, the King of Pop has died (obligatory M.J. reference, check), and Congress has been having oh so much fun attempting to tackle climate change and health care reform. 
And I start to think it may be best to strive for the Zen of Michael—bemusedly accepting the bizarre hilarity of having your boss sing High School Musical’s “Breaking Free” at you over the phone, the mild discomfort (which upon retelling also morphs into bizarre hilarity) of a rando making kissy faces at you on the Metro escalator as you avoid eye contact, and the mix of other emotions during those moments that make you sure your life is scripted.
Aditi Balakrishna ’10, a Crimson associate managing editor, is a neurobiology concentrator in Adams House. Not unlike Tobias, she’s going to take her actor’s pants off for a minute and pull her an-alrapist stocking over her head.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Police Department have recommended to the Middlesex District Attorney that the disorderly conduct charge against Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. be dropped, according to a joint press release.The District Attorney's office has agreed to no longer pursue the case, the statement said."The City of Cambridge, the Cambridge Police Department, and Professor Gates acknowledge that the incident of July 16, 2009 was regrettable and unfortunate," the statement said. "This incident should not be viewed as one that demeans the character and reputation of Professor Gates or the character of the Cambridge Police Department. All parties agree that this is a just resolution to an unfortunate set of circumstances."Gates, who was returning to Cambridge on Thursday after a trip to China, reportedly had difficulty opening his jammed front door and forced his way into his home with the help of his car driver. A woman reportedly saw the professor and alerted police to a possible break-in attempt. When officers arrived, the situation escalated, with Gates accusing police of racial profiling, according to police reports.
But according to law school Professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., who is serving as Gates' representative, Gates cooperated with police, providing both his Harvard identification and driver's license. Ogletree said police nevertheless arrested Gates when he stepped out onto his porch to ask for the officer's name and badge number.
Sergeant James DeFrancesco of the Cambridge Police declined to say whether the agreement represented any sort of admission of wrongdoing, or if there was a plea made, and said that police would have no further comment on the matter beyond the statement issued.Gates, who served as chair of the department of African and African American studies from 1991 to 2006, earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Cambridge after completing his undergraduate studies in history summa cum laude at Yale. Gates was awarded a MacArthur Foundation "Genius Grant" in 1981 and was named one of Time magazine's "25 Most Influential Americans" in 1997.
He is one of roughly 20 Harvard faculty members who hold prestigious University professorships, which are given to honor academic achievements that cross disciplinary boundaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON, D.C. — During his short tenure as manager of the Washington Nationals, Manny Acta witnessed 28 members of Congress lose their jobs due to poor performances; you’d think he’d have gotten the memo. Instead, he led the Nats to the worst first half of the baseball season in their history—and was promptly fired himself.
Except Acta probably did get the memo. Rumors about his job security have flown around Washington for months, and yet his team did no better. That, frankly, reflects a baseball reality that few are willing to concede: A manager has no significant impact on his team’s win total.
It might be specious to suggest that Acta could have just flipped a switch to become a better manager and save his job—except that this very logic is necessary to substantiate the belief that managers do make a difference. Take, for example, Joe Maddon, the celebrated manager of the Tampa Bay Rays. In his third year in Tampa, Maddon took the Rays to the World Series—after finishing dead last his first two years. Maddon is now regarded as one of the league’s best, because he succeeded in flipping that switch. 
In reality, the performance and talent of a team’s players make the real difference—a difference that might be correlated, in part, with the advice of a batting or pitching coach, but not with the more bureaucratic manager. It’s true that a manager does make strategic decisions about how to use that talent; the foundation of his job description includes fitting together a lineup and deciding when to make mid-game substitutions, especially of the pitcher. But while strategic decisions may turn the tide in one or two games, they’re hardly enough to mean the difference between a good team and a bad team over the course of a season.
Moreover, a manager’s decisions fail as often as they succeed, depending on luck or the smallest minutiae of a player’s performance. A manager might make the logical call to take out a starting pitcher after 130 pitches over eight and two-thirds shutout innings in a 1-0 game, but fans and pundits will cry foul if the next batter hits a home run.
Of course. that’s all theoretical, but it holds up in practice. Countless managers (Joe Torre and Terry Francona are two) only began to enjoy a winning reputation after escaping their jobs managing perennial losers—and taking the reins for teams with true talent. It also cannot be a coincidence that good teams are never considered to have sub-par managers.
The only remaining area where a manager might seem to make a difference lies in the intangibles he brings to the clubhouse: his ability to defuse conflicts, to maintain optimism, and to instill motivation in his team. But, ultimately, these too belong to the players. No matter how fiery a pep talk is, it takes major-league determination to channel it into a five-RBI night. Teams don’t win when they think they can win; teams win when they have good reason to think they can win.
The Nationals do not have that. In fact, they have the worst pitching and the worst defense in their league; that’s not Acta’s fault, and his firing is an unfortunate part of how the game is played. If they are serious about competing, the Nationals need to focus on making changes, on the field and in the mindset of their front office, that will fix what’s actually broken.
