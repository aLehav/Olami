After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though later his life would be caricatured in one of Walt Disney’s most celebrated films, Captain John Smith holds a more practical position in American legend than simply that of the man Pocahontas saved; according Wikipedia’s encompassing entry on “American literature,” he was also the first American author. During the early 1600s, Smith, a prominent member of newly colonized Jamestown, penned several works on the then-nascent history of the land he had christened New England.
Some four centuries after Smith’s arrival to America, three other New Englanders embarked on a literary journey of their own. With the intent of exploring historical facts in a greater socio-politico-cultural context, Werner Sollors (Harvard Professor of African and African American Studies), Greil Marcus (well-known music critic and the first reviews editor of “Rolling Stone”), and Lindsay Waters (Executive Editor for the Humanities of the Harvard University Press (HU Press)) began composing a reference book that attempts to redefine the standard approach to writing about America’s literary history, from foundation to modern-day. Aided by an editorial board and an impressive list of contributors, their creation is a 200-essay compendium they named “A Literary History of America.” Touching upon subjects from “The Scarlet Letter” to the Star Spangled Banner, the Winchester rifle to cybernetics, the essays begin with a focused analysis of one incident or figure and then extend outwards to address other relevant issues.
In an age when Wikipedia can inform the uninformed of most trivial details of John Smith’s life—but not what those details meant to the future of American literature—“Literary History” may be the innovative counterpart to the archetypal encyclopedic work. The HU Press publication has lofty aspirations. It wants—and deserves—to be read; but at 3.4 pounds, 1,100 pages, and $49.99, the tome may have misjudged its ability to appeal to the masses.
BEHIND ‘LITERARY HISTORY’
“I started the project because I had the primitive desire to have a big book that could explain my world; not a picture, but something that could convey the whole thing to readers,” Waters says regarding the concept behind “Literary History,” which he conceived in 1982. It was only on September 29, 2005 that the project would officially be set in motion. Also the catalyst behind HU Press’ similarly titled French and German literary histories, Waters, with Sollors and Marcus, created an editorial board that formed, as Waters puts it, a “search party”—one imparted with the task of ‘finding America.’ The 15-member board traversed centuries of American history, settling on a long list of topics that eschewed abstractions such as the definition of realism. Instead, in the board’s point of view, the final subjects are fundamentally relevant to American readers; the underlying them is an emphasis on things that have been “made,” a concept that Waters finds integral to the American mindset and tradition.
“America is about making…it’s the popular mechanics side of America,” he says. “When they were making the George Washington Bridge between Manhattan and New Jersey, the New Jersey and New York governments who designed it had a plan to cover the iron ore with marble. Somehow the general population heard about this and they said, ‘Just leave the steel exposed.’ It’s a basic American feeling to want to see how something was made.”
The requirement that topics be somehow linked to the process of creation left much room for interpretation of what serves as “literary” history. Consequently, the book has received criticism from some reviewers, such as The Globe’s columnist Alex Beam, for its inclusion of pop culture entries on, for instance, Barack Obama’s election or Linda Lovelace, lead actress of the film “Deep Throat.”
“Some people could say the subjects of the different entries aren’t all literary subjects, but the exploration of them is literary,” says reviewer Laura Miller, book editor for Salon.com. “It’s really an exploration of American culture, and American literary culture isn’t separable from pop culture, or visual, material, political, racial culture.”
Miller uses one entry as a metaphor for the book’s endeavor to engage with readers by honestly portraying what has been important to American literary history over the past five centuries. The essay compares “Yankee Doodle” to “The Star Spangled Banner,” the former which she describes as representative of an American impulse and the latter as an attempt to aspire to the seriousness of European heritage. “Only focusing on Longfellow, Whitman, Fitzgerald, and the litany of familiar figures is to me ‘The Star Spangled Banner’ approach,” Miller says. “I feel that this book is more of a ‘Yankee Doodle’ approach, a book that people really care about and engage with, than it is an attempt to set up a kind of aspirational highbrow idea of culture. They write about culture people actually had rather than culture we think they should have had.”
BUT WHERE IS ‘THE READER’?
Yet while the topics of the essays in “Literary History” may seem pedestrian at times, the Table of Contents reads like a Hall of Fame inductee list for distinction in both scholarship and pop culture.
Nonetheless, Waters, Sollors, and the remainder of the editorial board who sought out the rest of the contributors, stress that accessibility is one of “Literary History’s” primary objectives. As part of their mission to revise the means of representing literary history, they wanted to captivate the attention of readers commonly alienated by the formal, esoteric jargon of other scholarly works of this kind.
“I wrote for the same reader I always write for—the educated general reader,” says Ruth R. Wisse, Professor of Yiddish and Comparative Literature, who contributed an entry on Saul Bellow. “So if you’re using a literary term which is not immediately comprehensible, then it is your duty to explain it. Clarity is the one thing you aim for most.”
Contributors and reviewers referenced the general reader most frequently as the expected consumer of “Literary History,” but even they expressed concern that such an audience simply does not exist anymore.
“We were using the phrase ‘educated general reader’ [to describe our audience], but no one is quite sure who that reader is anymore,” says Kirsten Gruesz, Professor of Literature at University of California, Santa Cruz, an editorial board member and contributor of entries on Richard Dana, Jr. and “Mexico in America.” “It’s people who aren’t academics, who don’t necessarily see themselves as big-time readers, but who still maintain intellectual interests and want to know how to think about the world in the 21st century,” she speculates.
Miller is more skeptical. “The authors are people who are trying to write for a more general audience, but that audience spans the illiterate to the incredibly erudite. I don’t think the book is only for scholars…But it’s hard for me to judge what an average ignorant person finds hard to understand,” she says. “Some Americans are so ignorant it’s hard to say what the general reader is. The average American these days doesn’t even read.”
And though the book is often touted as what will be this year’s most popular holiday present, it is, admittedly, an expensive gift for the average American—even an intelligent one. Another reviewer, Scott Kaufman, Professor of English at University of California, Irvine, urges other academics to pursue the approachable prose that is, for the most part, proffered by “Literary History.” Yet he, among others, has described its relatively hefty price as “prohibitive,” calling into question its ability to be accessible if it is not affordable. While HU Press’ Sales Director, Susan Donnelly, says the work has been selling well, some believe the major market for the anthology is an institutional, rather than an individual, one.
“I’m sure that the sales of the book will especially be to libraries of various sorts, and most of all to college and university libraries, because that’s basically the biggest single customer base for big doorstop reference works of this kind,” says Lawrence Buell, Professor of American Literature, who contributed an entry on Margaret Fuller and the Transcendentalist Movement. Citing the price as an investment the individual customer would not perhaps make, he explains, “I’m not trying to sound critical of what the book’s attempting here, by any means. There’s definitely a market in the world for good reference works, but it’s typically an institutional market rather than an individual market.”
DIGITIZE
While it remains uncertain whether the intelligent general reader still exists,  Americans do seem to be reading—just, perhaps, via new media. In March 2009, Amazon launched the Kindle DX, its latest version of an electronic platform for digital media and e-books. The company reported that for those books available on the Kindle, sales were already at 35% of the same editions in print. And the Google Book Search Project, which has made over 10 million out-of-copyright titles available online, was able to do so at an estimated cost of $5 million, according to “The New York Times.”
In contrast, HU Press’ last fiscal year, which ended in July 2009, was a “perfect storm,” says Donnelly. Sales fell ten percent, according to a report by “The Crimson.” “Last year there was a financial crisis that the entire globe was situated within…And there is a lot of disorder in the world of publishing so we didn’t have such a great year last year,” she says, noting that the price of books in general is rising.
Though HU Press’ fiscal projections for this annual term are optimistic, the question of the viability and accessibility of printed media still lingers, especially when publishers’ outputs are in the form of expensive hardcover copies. “Hardback books are really expensive these days, especially with university and scholarly presses having a hard time meeting their margin,” Gruesz says. “I’ve personally been buying fewer scholarly books for my collection because even the paperback editions are $30-plus, so it’s a bigger question about the price of books in general.”
According to Donnelly, though the theory behind digitizing titles is solid, it is not necessarily realistic for any publishing company at this time.
“We can’t operate at a loss. We need a financial model that allows us to cover our costs. The Press doesn’t have one yet that is online only. If someone else has one that is online only, I don’t know what that is,” she says, pointing to the considerable expenses of publishing a book such as “Literary History,” with its multitude of contributors.
Despite the lofty expenses associated with a project such as “Literary History,” the rewards—scholarly, not monetary—that HU Press reaps warrant the investment. “The reason Harvard University has a press,” Donnelly says, “is to do things that are worthwhile projects in terms of the world of ideas or scholarship…We want to spend our money—what money we have—doing that kind of thing rather than try to publish something that will sell lots of copies and make lots of money. We want to do something positive for the world of ideas.”
According to Donnelly and Waters, there are plans to adapt the work into e-book format, though none have emerged for an online version. However, for Waters and Sollors, the decision to create “Literary History” as a book, first and foremost, was a natural one. According to Kaufman, the obvious reason behind such a move is that the well-respected academics and published authors in the group of contributors are part of a culture that holds printed editions in higher esteem than Internet versions.
Contributors have echoed this sentiment. “The book has a particular life form that remains very important, that hasn’t been completely substituted by the more fleeting Wikipedia-like existence of Internet resources,” says Sollors, who also speculated that print and online editions need not be mutually exclusive. “But let the book live as a book for a bit,” he says.
Yet the editors and the contributors do recognize the benefits of digitization, although they reason that the book needs to be in print for a few years before HU Press can recoup its costs and even begin to consider an online edition.
“My sense is that eventually they should [digitize] if only to make it accessible for the very substantial fraction of the world reading public, including a fair amount of America, that won’t have ready access to the print version,” Buell says, referring particularly to universities in the People’s Republic of China as one example of a potential market which will likely not be able to capitalize on the information in the work because of minimal acquisition budgets. “There would be a case where some virtualization strategy would be well-advised, and maybe [“Literary History”] could be sold for rights that would keep the Harvard Press from going under and would benefit hundreds of thousands,” he explains.
Wisse agrees, suggesting that while she would not herself have thought to put the book online, digitization has tremendous virtues.
“If you’re really serious about this kind of project and its accessibility and popularizing both the ideas and the content,” she says, “a more natural form nowadays would probably be online publication,” she says.
SKIPPING AHEAD
In this technologically-driven era, Internet users instinctively turn to the web—whether it is Wikipedia, or even simply Google—for the answers to any fact-based question. And Wikipedia, with its straightforward language and related links, is nothing if not accessible. Fundamentally, “Literary History” attempts to recreate the accessibility of this online reference source, even while it seeks to redefine what an encyclopedic work means to readers.
And yet to eschew the simplicity of Wikipedia is also to risk losing a reader in the midst of haphazard associations and esoteric mentions of related events and figures. “Literary History” has admirable intentions; it has striven to narrate a portion of America’s literary history by concentrating on the rigorous analysis of facts, while still keeping readers engaged.
According to Kaufman, however, a reference book written largely by individuals established in the academy has an inherent flaw, regardless of that work’s accessibility. “To a certain extent it kind of demonstrates the academic mindset, in that the only other people who have read the book contributed to it,” Kaufman says. “This happens all the time in academia. It’s just that they chose a different kind of academic, so some of the contributors are out as public intellectuals and public figures.”
For Wisse, as well, the work is a valuable resource, and one which will provide a basis of lively discussion over the content and criticism presented in the anthology. However, she admits, “I don’t often approach these things with high hopes.” Referring again to the tendency authors, including herself, have to fixedly retain their certain style of prose, she says, “I think that one can compare the essays that people wrote with their general writing and see a correlation…If they published in academic publications in a certain style, they probably carried that over.”
“When a general reader like yourself can’t understand something the fault is generally not in you but in the poor thinking [of the author],” she explains.
But for the founder of this project at least, “Literary History” is the original, thought-provoking, and explicable reference work he had hoped to create so many years ago at the project’s conception.
“We are trying to raise the level of discourse, not in an academic way but in a democratic way,” Waters says. “I hope [the book] doesn’t seem exclusive or elitist because I don’t think it is. But the fact that people can write—if that’s the sin, we’re willing to be condemned.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jumping up from his seat on the Loeb Mainstage at the close of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s panel on entering the theater industry, director Geordie F. Broadwater ’05 dramatically shouted, “It’s the late-night drunken artistic romance! It’s the 3 a.m., sitting with friends, drinking, and discussing theater in New York City! I live for that! I love that!” Despite this rousing conclusion, the panel was much more sobering, revealing that romance alone is not enough to sustain a career in the arts. For current HRDC members, the panelists emphasized the need to be honest and realistic about their prospects of finding a career in theater.
“There isn’t a lot of advising or guidance available for how to get a career in the arts,” says Matt C. Stone ’11, the historian of HRDC and primary organizer of the panel. “I’ve learned so much from HRDC, but there is no one here who will sit you down and tell you how to make a career in theater.” Because there is not a formal system in place for putting alumni in touch with recent grads, Stone has been working with the Harvard Alumni Association to compile a database of HRDC alums. The list includes professionals extending beyond actors and directors to set designers and light technicians. The panel consisted of recent alums with first-hand knowledge of breaking into the theater business.
“A good thing about having young alums and not big name people is that they are...trying to forge their career now and that’s what HRDC alums will do in one, two, three years from now,” Stone says. The audience seemed to find the panelists approachable, asking them questions about their thoughts on what city to move to after graduating and whether an agent is necessary. Alternating between questions from moderator Marcus Stern, associate director of the American Repertory Theater, and those from the audience, the panelists offered general advice on whether or not to attend graduate school and specific guidance on what schools were best for certain disciplines.
One of the key points emphasized by the panelists was the need to reconcile the lack of connection between the theater community at Harvard and the vibrant Harvard network in New York City arts. Describing this network, producer Karina A. Mangu-Ward ’05 explained, “We facilitate and co-market. We see each others’ shows even if we aren’t directly working with one another.” The difficulty is in knowing that this community exists and knowing where to find it. “I’m not going to go out of my way to get in touch with recent grads, but if they seek me out, I would give them advice,” actor Dan A. Cozzens ’03 added.
The panelists were also frustrated with the lack of practical preparation they received regarding how the theater industry works. “They should have an industry workshop where they teach people who want to act how to audition and how to get headshots because I didn’t know any of that,” Broadwater said. Stone agrees that a workshop is something that the HRDC could pull off with help from the A.R.T., which already teaches its students those basics.
But not all the discussion on the preparation that Harvard and the HRDC offered was critical. The panelists were unequivocally positive about the training—mental and professional—they received at Harvard. They lauded HRDC productions for being student-run and produced. Commenting on how this affects a young theater professional, writer Erica R. Lipez ’05 said, “It gives you a little bit of control over your destiny in an industry and city that doesn’t want to give you that.”
Despite a small turnout, Stone sees the event as a good starting point for HRDC’s alumni initiatives, which have been expanding since the influx of alumni to Cambridge last year to celebrate the HRDC’s 100th anniversary. With a new alumni newsletter, Stone hopes to develop and strengthen the club’s relationship with alumni, while more panels on a larger scale help to fill the void of theater career advising.
“There’s this perception that having a successful career in theater is an extremely difficult thing to do, maybe even impossible,” Stone said. Echoing the sentiments of the panelists about the difficulties and possibilities of creating a career in theater from an HRDC background, Stone reiterated the importance of contacting alumni. “But from all the alumni that I’ve corresponded with, I’ve seen that a Harvard education 110 percent prepares you for that. It’s just that we aren’t so good at networking with the alumni we have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Based on an ancient Greek myth, John Eccles’ early 18th century opera “Semele” is undergoing an update for its latest incarnation in the New College Theatre, albeit one that still keeps it vintage. Director Victoria J. Crutchfield ’10 has transplanted the rarely-performed English opera, which will run through Sunday, to the 1970s with the hope that the inaccessibility of the classical original will melt away with the modernizing adjustments such as the transformation of the original priests into hippies. With this new setting mixing the lighthearted and the dark, the new production aims for a sense of relevance and freshness.
The original story of Semele, which William Congreve adapted for his libretto, is a oft-told tale. The titular mortal protagonist falls in love with Jupiter, king of the gods. They have an affair, but when Jupiter’s jealous wife Juno finds out, she swears revenge. Furious, Juno disguises herself as a mortal and appears to Semele, convincing the poor girl to question Jupiter’s immortality. Semele, unaware that the sight of Jupiter in all his divine glory is fatal, demands to see him as a god. He begs her not to, but she stands firm, and once he reveals himself, she is burned in the heat of his thunderbolts.
The myth is typically Greek, but it’s moral is hardly ancient. “The way Semele expresses her dissatisfaction with the relationship and the way Jupiter responds to that could happen in any age,” says music director Julia S. Carey ’08.
James C. Liu ’89, who plays Jupiter, agrees. “Parts of the libretto explore the relationship between men and women in a way that is surprisingly modern,” he says. Semele’s ambition and her desire to contend with Jupiter as an equal can be likened to the women’s movement of the 1970s, he suggests. And though this is not the focus of the performance, it is certainly an underlying theme that helps lend the opera some contemporary relevance.
In terms of set design and staging, Crutchfield achieves the feeling of the 1970s through what she terms “fantastically ugly furniture” and “fabulous patterns.” This, however, is only true of the mortal realm; the gods reside in the baroque period. This contrast sets up what Crutchfield calls a “war of patterns”—a battle between the wallpapers and fabrics of the two eras that becomes a major aesthetic element of the performance.
This lightheartedness mixes tantalizingly with the darkness of the original myth.
“Victoria has staged it brilliantly, in that there are some darker themes that she brings out without losing the light feeling as a whole,” says Lily T. Kass ’10, who plays Ino. And though Eccles’ baroque music remains unchanged (it’s even played using period instruments), for Kass, this does not equal an aesthetic clash. “The music is what gives it its delight,” Kass says. “The music is what gives it its emotion.”
The sentiment is echoed by the play’s Cupid, Robin W. Reinert ’10. “The rhetoric of the music,” she says, “brings out the rhetoric of the words.” The complementary arias that Semele and Jupiter share, for example, focus the story on their relationship and demonstrate the varied layers of emotion of their characters. This lack of simplistic dichotomies—both in terms of their relationship and in terms of the light and dark mixture as well—is another theme of the production.
“Semele” is an intriguing challenge, simultaneously ancient and contemporary; but the cast and crew hope the interplay between the baroque and the psychedelic, between the light and the dark, will help “Semele” bridge the ages and stand as a uniquely modern opera.

“Now my charms are all o’erthrown, / And what strenth I have’s mine own, / Which is most faint…” Prospero opens his epilogue to “The Tempest” with strange and wistful words: his spells are breaking even as he speaks; his return to the mortal world—and to a death that, though outside the comedy’s arc, feels eerily close—is imminent. But Shakespeare’s final play is too full, quakes with too much wonder and life to fall beneath the long shadow of its author’s final bow. The end, be it of magic, of art, or of life, comes only as Prospero himself, satisfied, willingly relinquishes.
But what if Prospero is a deceiver? A usurper? A false sovereign, like Macbeth? Philip Roth’s latest novel, “The Humbling,” suggests the synthesis of these two roles in the book’s protagonist: the aging, once-great stage actor Simon Axler. “He’d lost his magic. The impulse was spent. He’d never failed in the theater, everything he had done had been strong and successful, and then the terrible thing had happened: he couldn’t act,” it begins. The novel’s central crisis, Axler’s loss of the ability to act, becomes a symbol—thin though it may seem—for a world coming apart at its very fabric. “The Humbling,” Roth’s thirtieth book and his fourth novel in as many years, is a brief and anguished meditation on the social, physical, and mental decay of an individual whose identity is ripped out from beneath him. Axler’s life, constituted by ability to perform on and off the stage, proffers itself as transient. His only recourse is to cling to those who still have the will to perform, but it’s a temporary solution. Like Prospero, he is the magician whose powers have left him. Like Macbeth, those powers were never his to begin with.
These days, Roth is about as prolific as he is grim. His most recent novels have all dealt in almost expository detail with the subject of death and its inextricability from the spectrum of human experience. “The Humbling,” with its three-act structure and its otherwise bare narrative that alternates predominantly between dialogue with Axler and his inner-monologue, could essentially serve as an allegory for Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” soliloquy. The entirety of the novel, from Axler’s time in a mental institution following his breakdown, to his affair with a 20-years-junior lesbian family friend named Pegeen Mike (after a character in Synge’s “Playboy of the Western World”), and his final projection fantasy and eventual ‘humbling’ at Pegeen’s hands, is essentially in deference to that central question. It’s a cruel (if not particularly funny) joke that Axler’s breakdown ensued after a failed Prospero/Macbeth double bill. It’s simply inevitable, then, that when Axler finally answers Hamlet’s question for himself—his confidence, his sense of spontaneity as an actor finally restored—it comes in the form of an improvisatory gesture.
But even that gesture, a suicide tailored in the fashion of Chekov’s “The Seagull,” with a note bearing that play’s final lines, is inherently a performance; “It was in an Actors Studio Broadway production of ‘The Seagull,’ and it marked his first big New York success, making him the most promising young actor of the season, full of certainty and a sense of singularity, and leading to every unforeseeable contingency.” For Axler, this consummate performance, this total surrender of the self in the acknowledgement of the world’s pervasive spectacle, is an act of transcendence. Within the novel, however, it reads more simply; as desperate, as derivative, as meaningless. This is the book Roth has delivered: the rules don’t just prevent you from winning; they prevent you from even playing.
Even the transgressive sexual dynamic that takes hold of the final chapter is hemmed in by the novel’s overtly intellectualized conceit. Pegeen’s reversion from lesbianism, rather than providing the sufficiently developed emotional component that would complicate the novel in an engaging way, merely serves to mix and match psychoanalytic tropes through progressively convoluted and prop-oriented sexual encounters. She becomes a symbol for Axler’s diminished potency, literally wearing a symbol of phallic power during their lovemaking, and his realization of that fact does little more than render it explicit; “They drove home with Pegeen’s hand down his pants. ‘The smell,’ she said, ‘it’s on us,’ while Axler though, I miscalculated—I didn’t think it through. He was the god Pan no longer. Far from it.”
“The Humbling” comes shortly on the heels of last year’s “Indignation,” a similarly clipped, brutal character study, this time of a younger Rothian hero, Marcus Mesner: the already- (or almost-) deceased narrator who must recount and scrutinize the events that lead to his expulsion from Winesburg College and a death sentence at the front lines of the Korean War. Like in “The Humbling,” the thematic and narrative concerns of that book seemed more important to Roth than the construction of an illuminating or sympathetic relationship with the character. The ambiguity that permeates “The Humbing”—of age, of gender, of morality—and the subtlety and variety with which it’s applied, makes it clear that Roth is still capable of telling a story that engages the intellect. A particularly graphic sex scene between Axler, Pegeen and a woman the couple picks up takes on the metaphorical power of Greek drama or Freudian apocrypha; “There was something primitive about it now, this woman-on-woman violence, as though… Pegeen were a magical composite of shaman, acrobat, and animal. It was as if she were wearing a mask on her genitals, a weird totem mask, that made her into what she was not supposed to be.”
But at 140 pages, Roth never gives “The Humbling” any opportunity to be more than an exercise in writing that can be ‘read’ in those various ways. Roth seems to have given no consideration to an emotional center to his novel, and purposefully so. And while this provides for a fascinating project—doubtless a project only made possible by a genius like Roth’s—this fascination never translates to enjoyment. Nor does the admiration one may hold for Roth’s vaunted corpus ever translate to a redemptive case for yet another joyless, featherweight book from one of America’s greatest novelist. In 2004, the author, now 76, selected a biographer, in a gesture that suggests, like Gabriel García Márquez, that Roth is aware of his own mortality on the horizon. Though he already has another novel scheduled for publication next year, Roth’s host of references to Shakespeare almost insist on comparison to the Bard at the end of his career. Roth seems either unaware or obstinate in the face of the fact that Shakespeare only had one farewell, and that it was unforgettable. “The Humbling” is anything but.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A thick haze of melancholy floats above every page of the works of Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk, settling amidst the words like fog over the Bosphorus. In his 2005 memoir “Istanbul,” Pamuk intersperses evocative personal reflections on the neglected city with monochrome images of rainy streets and crumbling minarets; his prose, with its concern for the visual over the intellectual, assumes the nostalgic intimacy of a forgotten postcard. The sadness of his characters merges inseparably with the troubled political and cultural landscape of Turkey: though both characters and nation stand on the brink of happiness, it remains always just out of reach.
Pamuk’s newest book, “The Museum of Innocence”—available to an English-speaking audience a year after its publication in Turkey—distills the sepia tones of his oeuvre into their purest and most poignant form yet. Readers looking for a follow-up to 2002’s “Snow,” a politically charged exploration of Islamic extremism, won’t find it here. Pamuk’s name took on a controversial coloring in the wake of that novel—in 2005, his remarks about the Ottoman Empire’s massacre of Armenians and Kurds earned him a much-debated prosecution under Turkish law for “explicitly insulting the Republic,” and a year later he took home the Nobel Prize in Literature amidst accusations by his countrymen that he had sold out to the West. But Pamuk is no activist. In his latest, civil war and sectarian violence make an appearance only as background—instead it’s the relationship between modern love and loss, problematic in its own right, that becomes the stuff of his dreamlike meditations.
Stripped to its essence, the plot is an old-fashioned tale of unrequited love. Kemal, a successful middle-aged Turkish businessman, walks into a boutique to buy a handbag for his fiancée and is immediately smitten with an 18-year-old shopgirl named Füsun, who happens to be a distant relative of his. Their affair—initially, a casual one—takes on a special gravity; despite its European affectations, 1970s Istanbul remains deeply wary of women who have sex before marriage. The two eventually do consummate their relationship, however, and the first few chapters of the book are devoted to surprisingly graphic descriptions of the body and the ecstasy they share.
This being a Pamuk novel, of course, that happiness is short-lived. While the unabashed descriptions of lovemaking can at times verge on clumsy, the descriptions of loss are etched in sharp relief. Kemal, much to his regret, ends things with Füsun, and the next 350-odd pages chronicle his devastating remorse and unsuccessful attempts to win her back. In the process, he alienates his friends, breaks off his engagement, sacrifices his stake in a distribution and export firm, and even starts a production company called Lemon Films Inc. to finance the absurd scripts of his ex-lover’s chubby screenwriter husband (a mere excuse to visit their apartment). Society dismisses Kemal as foolish or eccentric, but to him it doesn’t matter: for love is “something to which one devote[s] one’s entire being at the risk of everything.” Throughout the stunningly long period over which his heartbreak unfolds—2,864 days, or nearly eight years—he obsessively collects thousands of objects that Füsun has touched, or that remind him of her. Cigarette stubs bearing the impress of her mouth or traces of her lipstick, a saltshaker she’d once happened to use—all find a place in his room to be arranged as a “museum of innocence” for his beloved.
The book moves slowly, as it’s meant to. Kemal preserves moments in his memory as meticulously as the objects in his museum, cataloguing them in careful and loving detail. Pamuk himself completed this novel over a period of six years, spending at least 10 hours each day alone writing in a flat overlooking old Istanbul, and the sense of that isolation drifts throughout his painstaking dissection of heartbreak. More than any other novelist today, Pamuk has laid claim to the dispassionate prose style and layered, self-reflective inheritance of Proust. At one point, he follows a numbered list of the ways in which Turkish girls are socially condemned for surrendering their chastity before marriage with a note: “Clever readers will have sensed that I have placed this anthropological lesson here to allow myself a chance to cool off from the jealousy that Füsun’s love stories provoked.” Elsewhere, his reveries achieve an absolute stillness: “There was beauty to behold in the world, that was all there was to it: the summer night was cooled by the north wind blowing off the Bosphorus, rustling the leaves of the plane trees in the courtyard of the Tesvikiye Mosque, and causing them to whisper in that soft lovely way I remembered from my childhood.” “Museum” is a thick tome, but such prose feels as light as air. Indeed, the novel as a whole admittedly prioritizes atmosphere over plot, but that aesthetic of melancholy is precisely where Pamuk excels.
With that mindset wilts one potentially massive critique: Pamuk never writes his way out of Istanbul; the physical and mental geography mapped out in “Museum” is old hat. Lost loves and newspaper columnists, tea houses and Turkish-brand sodas recur in all his books, and the emphasis on B-movies and the world of cinema in particular strongly echoes the more metaphysical treatment afforded them in his novel “The New Life.” These themes could easily grow as worn as the belongings of Füsun’s that Kemal so often caresses.
But Pamuk avoids claustrophobia by elevating his repetitions into a self-referential body of work as complex as that of Nabokov, Barth, or Bolaño. Just as with those writers, the relationship between author and fiction remains intriguingly fluid. Many of Pamuk’s fictional landmarks are recognizable from his non-fiction memoir; Kemal even meets a character named Orhan Pamuk at his engagement party.
In the book’s final pages, the lines between Kemal, the narrator, and the “real” Pamuk blur to the point of indistinguishability—all three men come to seem interchangeable with each other, as well as with any of the narrators in Pamuk’s other books. These tiny, invisible connections unspool gradually to spin out a place both intricate and familiar, the nostalgia-saturated inverse of the fast-paced modern city: turning the first few pages of the “Innocence” feels like nothing more than coming home.
It’s fitting, then, that this novel so sensitive to the memory of past works finds substance in a tale of objects illuminated by the memories they evoke. “Museum of Innocence” may lack the tight construction of predecessors like “My Name Is Red,” but Kemal’s frustrated recollections resonate more intimately than anything Pamuk has written before.
Having taken to long, solitary swims in the unsuccessful attempt to forget Füsun, Kemal remembers that “Later, when I had swum back to shore and lay exhausted under the sun with my eyes closed, I would entertain the hopeful thought that all serious and honorable men who happened to fall passionately in love went through the same things as I did.” Like the anise-flavored raki that characters drink together to take refuge from their individual disappointments, “The Museum of Innocence” can be a bitter draught—but it’s also a sublime consolation.

As an 11-year-old boy, Jakov Lind (who died in 2007) fled from the Nazi-occupied Vienna to Holland and survived the Holocaust by assuming a Dutch identity. After the war he moved around, living in Israel and returning to Vienna for a while, but finally settled in London. Lind began his literary career by publishing a collection of short stories “Soul of Wood” and continued to write in both German and English.
Lind’s third novel “Ergo,” first published in 1968 and now translated into English by Ralph Manheim, is in many facets a product of his experience under the Nazi regime. The novel is rife with allusions to Hitler and his dominion, and the narrative itself is filled with a pervasive sense of horror the subtext of which could only be those atrocities.
“Ergo” is the story of three men—the widower Wacholder, his stepson Aslan, and the tenant Leo—living at “Custom House No. 8,” a dilapidated lodgment by an unnamed river. Much of the plot is chaotic or simply unclear. The novel takes for granted its unconventional structure; it frequently jumps from character to character, with each delivering bizarre and fanciful episodes. The narrative treats characters without any semblance of sympathy or logic. During the first half of the book, Aslan barely carries a significant role. All the reader knows about him is that he is an aspiring writer who repeatedly copies works of canonical German writers and that he has written a four-page-long novel. Suddenly and out of context, Leo slaughters him with an axe, appears in Aslan’s afterlife as a god or a demigod, and chants like a mad prophet: “every day isn’t easter, the rabbits haven’t laid any eggs this year, so we’ve postponed the resurrection ceremonies from easter to christmas...”
Both aesthetically and historically, “Ergo” is a piece of disillusioned postwar literature. The entire novel is as arbitrary, surrealistic, and tenebrous as the episode of Aslan’s death. Its violent content and spastic structure incarnate the fury of war and the gloom of post-war Europe.
The chaos of the novel serves as a background for Lind’s omnipresent existentialism. Because in the world of “Ergo” everything is permitted, Lind takes the liberty of mentioning the concept everywhere. From the most quotidian of conversations to the Leo’s deitific chants, the characters communicate via existential tropes from modern literature whose clearest source is Samuel Beckett.
In fact, the characters themselves are existential questions. Each occupies himself with an interminable quest: Wacholder wants to destroy his doppelganger figure Würz; but Aslan wants to write literary masterpieces, copies others instead; Leo never leaves his bed and only thinks about existence. Their stories—if there are any—unfold through their pathetic attempts to reach the unreachable. Wacholder, for example, tries to eliminate Würz, who might as well be Wacholder himself, by writing him half threatening and half incomprehensible letters; by inventing imaginary, toxic juice; or by simply thinking that Würz does not exist.
In the end, however, “Ergo” is obnoxiously one-dimensional. Of course there are many abstract ideas presented in the book, but they all serve a single purpose: existential terror. The novel explores no other sentiment. Even the intercourse of Wacholder and Trude Böckling, a minor character from the government, is described in a disturbing fashion. Böckling goes, “Kill a Trude Böckling with a little fellow like that? Don’t be silly.” “Aren’t you a whore?” answers Wacholder.
Lind’s language is vulgar, again without variation. Toward the end of the book, Leo says, “We pull on God’s cock therefore, we are. Penem Dei tractamus ergo sumus.” This declaration is presumably an important sentence, considering the fact that the title of the novel “Ergo,” which means “therefore” in Latin, is derived from the quote. However, the redundant use of crude language and even the purpose behind its use, which is always the same, become an annoyance. The structural chaos of “Ergo” only aggravates the redundancy. Lind’s technique—whether concerning plot, character, or language—disturbs for the sake of disturbance.
“Ergo” deserves a certain degree of credit if only for its ability to genuinely terrify. It would be difficult to find a postwar book that leaves an impression as petrifying as “Ergo.” But a novel, due to its inherent features as a genre, tends to reach its height when it delivers multi-layered thoughts and sensations that expand themselves throughout the breadth of reading. Instead of delivering on this front, Jakov Lind limited the artistic potential of the novel by consciously designating a purpose to it. “Ergo,” unfortunately, is like a long, repetitive commentary on postwar terror that can never stand alone without its historical context.

George Martin, the Beatles’ producer, once said of George Harrison that he was “always there yet somewhat elusive.” The same could be said of Scott Kannberg.Kannberg was Pavement’s everpresent enigma, writing a couple of songs per album but without a readily discernible style or persona. His songs tended to be impenetrable as well; even his moniker, Spiral Stairs, was adopted in order to give the band an air of mystery. Spiral Stairs was always secondary to Stephen Malkmus, the chief songwriter and public face, but as the 1990s wore on Kannberg became increasingly marginalized as Pavement became more and more an expression of Malkmus’ personal vision. Pavement’s final studio album, 1999’s “Terror Twilight”, contained no Spiral Stairs songs, and within two years Malkmus had launched a solo career—occasionally with backing band the Jicks—that has kept him squarely in the mainstream. Spiral Stairs, by contrast, released two albums with his band Preston School of Industry: two albums that, while pleasant and diverting enough, sank without a trace both in the market and in the memory. The first questions one would ask of a Spiral Stairs solo debut, then, are whether it reveals anything significant about this rather shadowy figure, and whether it will restore him to popular and aesthetic relevance. On both points, “The Real Feel” is frustratingly inconclusive. But speaking solely of the music, its erratic moments of lightness and beauty can make for unexpected delights. Unsurprisingly, “The Real Feel” is so unfocused and incoherent that it sounds either like a throwaway bunch of songs collected over the years or an intentional repudiation of the conventional notion of the album as a self-contained work of art. It is difficult to resist the comparison to Malkmus, whose albums both alone and with the Jicks have been notable for their internal consistency. Every Pavement album had a distinct character too, from the sunny melodicism of “Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain” to the deliberate inscrutability of “Wowee Zowee” and the bittersweet elegy that was “Terror Twilight.” Kannberg, by stark contrast, has put out a debut album whose only claim to a character of its own is a lack of unifying features. At times, the lack of focus is married to a lack of discipline that manifests itself in self-indulgence and tasteless jokes. “Blood Money,” an eight-minute opus, can be counted in the ranks of the former. Its dirge-like feel and length are reminiscent of Pavement’s 1992 epic “Fillmore Jive,” but it has none of that song’s musical variety or piercing lyrical attack. Jokes that fall flat include “Stolen Pills” and, above all, the bonus track, which features an elderly British woman essentially doing a send-up of a Judi Dench accent while introducing the album. Yet these clunkers are more than compensated for by the album’s highlights: “Cold Change” and “Mighty Mighty Fall” are elegant and refreshingly melodic. Stephen Malkmus was generally credited with having the greater melodic gifts, but “Cold Change” is nothing like a Malkmus song; it is strident, anthemic, and a little poppy rather than angular and fragile. “Mighty Mighty Fall” is a full-fledged country song, a wistful reflection on decline and collapse that evokes Ryan Adams at his most affecting. These out-of-nowhere masterpieces are coupled with enjoyable though less arresting tracks like the opener, “True Love,” where jangling guitars reminiscent of “Reckoning”-era Peter Buck lead into an infectious sing-along melody. The lyrics, as ever, veer for most of the album between the unintelligible and the nonsensical. At its best, however, the Spiral Stairs renders this criticism a minor quibble. If “The Real Feel” tells us anything meaningful about Scott “Spiral Stairs” Kannberg, it is that he is every bit as inscrutable as we thought, but possesses a skill of light-hearted melody that few could have credited him with. Like Malkmus’ solo work, this album is unambitious and minor, seemingly intended to divert and entertain rather than truly move. Still, it is an undeniable pleasure to have the inimitable Spiral Stairs back in our midst.                       —Staff writer Keshava D. Guha can be reached at kdguha@fas.harvard.edu.

There was a time when “African music” meant something other than “new indie-chic” and pale indie boys in cardigans and Sperry Topsiders violently clutching copies of “Graceland” like Bibles on Judgment Day. This was a time when African music was a naturally occurring phenomena that filled spaces with joyful noise, pulsing, engaging rhythms and call-and-response camaraderie. This is the time that is revisited on The Very Best’s new album, “The Warm Heart of Africa.”
Founded in 1999 with Malawaian vocalist Esau Mwamwaya fronting the daring production of London-based DJ duo Radioclit, The Very Best released the critically acclaimed mixtape “Esau Mwamwaya and Radioclit are the Very Best” in 2008. The mixtape was equally indebted to traditional African musical traditions and their corresponding Western interpretations. The most bizarre example of this, perhaps, was seeing Mwamwaya sing in Chichewa over Vampire Weekend’s “Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa” in a bold, globally-minded move to transcend the African sound and enter the arena of global pop.
“Warm Heart of Africa” continues in a similar vein, but where the mixtape was paying respects to its African influences, “Warm Heart of Africa” re-Westernizes those influences into something entirely independent, eschewing critical pandering for transcendence.
The album opens with “Yalira” (“sound” in Chichewa), a warm hymn of welcome and sweeping promise of the sounds to come. “You are all welcome / Let’s all dance because the fire is burning,” the song begins (in English translation) “Hey London!/ Hey New York! / Hey Paris! / Hey Lilongwe!” This song serves as the album’s thesis: the music is not about the past, its influences, or what critics will think; it’s simply about sound and enjoyment. It has no place—though sung in Chichewa and inspired in part by a variety of African sounds, it’s a product of the world.
“Chalo,” or “World,” continues in a similarly epic fashion, leaving no room for interpretation when it comes to questions about the album’s themes: love, truth, music, and other universals. The topics are sweepingly large, but The Very Best has the musical muscle to match. On the track, Mwamwaya spreads his bracing, multi-tracked vocals across the crisp, rollicking synths of Radioclit that would be equally at home in an ’80s pop hit. The song moves between the peaks of Mwamwaya’s choral cries and the hushed intimacy of the calming and repetitive beat, creating moving dynamics that keep it from becoming repetitive.
The similarly upbeat title-track, “Warm Heart of Africa,” is led by Ezra Koenig, Vampire Weekend’s “African music”-mimicking lead singer, to surprisingly enjoyable effect. His verse feels forced, as does his delivery, but the melody is like a warm beam of sunshine, elucidating Radioclit’s sparkling guitar jabs and open-air percussion, especially evident in their extensive use of cowbell.
Radioclit unveil their westernized, hip-hop stylings on songs like “Angonde” and “Julia.” On “Angonde,” the sound expands, rolling with thick, pounding drums and a soft, insistently rhythmic, Arabian guitar. Here, Radioclit process Mwamwaya’s rich vocals with a vocoder, electrifying and stiffening his voice to levels well below the T-Pain and Imogen Heap side of the spectrum so he maintains some of his trademark warmth while providing the crisp, electric harmonies. Throughout the track, a lone, hopeful violin pours lethargically beautiful lines over the dense and ambling drums that are intermingled with the percolating, rhythmic noises blissfully simmering below the surface.
“Julia” successfully melds the repetitive synth-hooks and deep drums of modern hip-hop with Mwamwaya’s hundred-voice-harmonies. It is, however, too patterned for its own good and remains one of the less-engaging tracks on the album.
All of these songs, however, pale in comparison to “Mfumu,” or “King,” the best track on the album. The glitchy bells and high-hat dance across the sturdy beat of the kick drum while Mwamwaya performs aural acrobatics high above. Listening to this song is like staring out of the open moon roof in a moving car on a clear night: grand, yet intimate, life-affirming and filled with wonder.
The album breaks most genre-categories. Its aim is the creation of a moving and gorgeous sound, and it succeeds gloriously. This is the “African” music all of the Vampire Weekends have been striving to create for years: unbridled, joyful, lush, and paradoxically cosmic.
Most who try to create an album like this fail for one simple reason: “African music” as we think of it is not necessarily the music of Africa, despite its superficially African qualities. This is joyful music of the world, well-removed from any and all critical and commercial qualms. This is the very best kind of music—music that wants nothing more than to be made and loved.

In retrospect, the drug-hazed guitar smashing of Kurt Cobain and ’90s Seattle grunge seems like the equivalent of pink bunny slippers compared to what his contemporaries in Norway were up to. Scandinavia’s coldest country made headlines last decade for its thriving second wave black metal scene—as bands like Mayhem and Gorgoroth drove concert-goers to frenzied bliss with wave after wave of shrieking vocals, aggressive tremolo-picking, and guitar-riffing distortion, some misguided fans went out to burn churches and commit savagely ritualistic murders, citing the music as an influence. When the smoke finally cleared, Europeans—especially the British press—were more than ready to swap out the electric guitars for acoustic ones; listeners ditched their earplugs and settled in for the lower-key, turn-of-the-millennium after-party. Dubbed the “Bergen Wave” for the explosion of ambient electronica and folk-pop bands in that city, the new musical landscape canvassed a variety of genres and sounds. One quality held it together, though: it was decidedly mellow.
Of all the groups to emerge from that movement, sweater-clad, skinny-white-boy duo Kings of Convenience—otherwise known as Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe—have found the most commercial success. Critical acclaim up to this point has been well-deserved: their delicate guitar strumming, occasionally infused with piano, horns, and violin, channels the pared-down acoustics of Pink Moon-era Nick Drake and warm harmonizing of Simon & Garfunkel into gentle, unassumingly beautiful melodies. Øye, the Paul Simon of the pair, sings in a slightly accented baritone about girls he’s once known or wishes he had; Bøe backs him up with a softer vocal counterpoint and elegant instrumentals.
“Declaration of Dependence,” the band’s third album, comes after a five-year gap in their discography. That long wait makes its blandness all the more underwhelming. Despite the delay, the new album sounds like Øye and Bøe simply wandered into the studio with their guitars one balmy afternoon. While the songs are as tranquil (and drum-shy) as ever—though perhaps a wee bit sunnier, thanks to a hint of bossa nova influence—they’re effortless in a way that suggests lack of precision rather than artistic aptitude.
Though lacking any stand-out single, moments of beauty are flecked throughout. Three broken chords plink out a simple, reassuring repetition in lullaby-like opener “24-25.” A lovely seesawing violin ushers in one of the album’s relatively fuller tracks, “Peacetime Resistance.” And Øye’s voice haunts the skeletal structure of “My Ship Isn’t Pretty” with brooding lyrics like “The sky was the blankest sheet / We drew lines upon it / So our thoughts could meet / Through cables black and cold.”
Yet the album’s 13 tracks aren’t just instrumentally sparser than past material; put simply, they’re also just not as catchy. Part of the problem is that they fail to develop their austere plucking into any grander themes, as the best selections from previous albums have managed to do. On 2004’s “I’d Rather Dance With You,” still their most perfectly crafted pop song to date, a stair-stepping piano outro elevates a jaunty beat to perfection; on 2001’s “I Don’t Know What I Can Save You From,” a gorgeous, transcendental violin solo strikes up around the three-minute mark. Every song on “Declaration,” on the other hand, pleases in almost exactly the same register from beginning to end. Kings of Convenience has never aspired to the shimmering textural distortions or swirling build-up of similarly laid-back bands like Grizzly Bear; but here, the crystalline simplicity of their music is symmetric to a fault.
This featureless quality of the new album’s soundscape is especially bizarre given the experience the boys were racking up on hiatus. After releasing their two studio albums—“Quiet Is the New Loud” and “Riot on an Empty Street”—as well as a remix compilation featuring high-profile guest artists like Four Tet and Ladytron, the two friends parted ways for a few years to pursue other priorities. Øye packed his bottle-cap glasses and scruff aesthetic off to Berlin, where he turn-tabled, released a successful solo album, reworked old favorites into catchy dance tunes for Studio !K7’s DJ Kicks series, and recorded ’80s-influenced electro-pop with side project Whitest Boy Alive. Meanwhile, the more introverted Bøe played gigs with his own second band, Kommode, and spent time at home in Bergen with his wife. Their musical reunion this year—in Mexico, of all places—promised to synthesize their respective sensibilities into a more satisfying, cohesive whole than ever before.
Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. A more exciting collaboration may indeed still lie ahead, but it won’t be found here. “Declaration of Dependence” is not a bad album; its only offense is just how totally inoffensive it is. The album works as background music for calm browsing in a used bookstore, or light accompaniment to late-night conversation with a friend, but it fails to stand up to any sustained listening, When the post-reunion glow wears off, Kings of Convenience will need either more hooks or more complex ways to communicate the emotional intensity their vocals and lyrics suggest.

Take Atlas Sound’s first album, “Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel,” overdose it on Adderall, add an actual beat, and put it over an open flame, and you get “Legos,” the newest psychedelic pop-rock album from Deerhunter’s Bradford Cox under his solo project moniker. Fusing acoustic guitar chords, haze-like ambient synth, trippy electronic beats, and a yin-yang of light and dark tones, Atlas Sound succeeds in escaping the ill effects of the dreaded sophomore slump, creating a lively, relaxing, musically adept and diverse second solo project. With an ideal balance of fast and slow, poppy and downer, “Logos” is a commendable addition to Cox’s already impressive body of work.
Atlas Sound has been Cox’s baby since its birth back in 1994 when, in sixth grade, he bought his own cassette karaoke recording machine and began making music. Using combinations of voice, guitars, electronic bass, and drums, Atlas Sound created a unique sound—a cross between the blurry trip-inducing buzz of the Flaming Lips and mind-bending Radiohead-esque vocals and electro-acoustics. For Cox, Atlas Sound has become his outlet for more personal electronic explorations.
Atlas Sound’s first album was distinguished by an overall unhappiness throughout its indiscernible words, despressing lyrics, and occasional major chords. Such quiet, low, minor, and slightly creepy tones can be found on several of the tracks on “Logos”—such as “The Light That Failed,” “An Orchid,” and “Kid Klimax”—featuring sparse notes above middle C, screeching vocals, and slow tempo. “The Light That Failed” possesses progressively louder synthesizer screeches, distorted whispers, and a lack of any true melody, chorus, or lyrics; a repetitive guitar riff, rooted in minor chords, plays over a background sound that calls to mind water dripping from a faucet. Though this subtracts from the track’s overall musicality, these dark motifs balance the upbeat songs which come later, making the album more effective overall.
“Walkabout” is one such song, a collaboration with musician Noah Lennox aka Animal Collective’s Panda Bear. From start to finish, “Walkabout” is four minutes of musical genius. Led by drums, carried by a buoyant rhythm, backed up with a pronounced electronic riff, and topped off with a serenade of jolly vocals, it’s a track to be reckoned with. “What did you want to see? What did you want to be when you grew up?” Lennox asks repeatedly during the song’s chorus. The somewhat childish and innocent tone of these lyrics does not hinder the song’s maturity—in fact, the similarly happy lyrics throughout the rest of the song simply keep it extremely fun with repeated listens.
This complete 180 from the dark tones of some of the other tracks is thankfully continued througout the rest of the album. “Sheila” continues this racy flow with actually intelligible lyrics, unlike the mumbles that filled most of Atlas Sound’s first album. Oddly enough, though, these lyrics drift back into the dark and mysterious realm even as the sound remains accessbily poppy; “Sheila, we will die alone together,” Cox sings in a deceptively upbeat voice.
While in the final two tracks, “Washington School” and “Logos,” vocals are either absent or barely audible, the once-surprisingly quick tempo does not die down. Both songs exhibit new and different combinations of mixed sounds and beats—as do each of the other tracks—never becoming a copy or continuation of a previous one.
Cox successfully redeems himself for his semi-failure of a first album, lifting the listeners’ spirits to counterbalance the depression provided by a few of the tracks. With a balanced, cyclical array of different beats, tones, and melodies, “Logos” is a cohesive, clear, and fun album to listen to from beginning to end.

If anyone’s voice can capture the wistful romanticism of sadness by the sea, it’s that of Death Cab for Cutie’s Ben Gibbard. On “One Fast Move or I’m Gone: Kerouac’s Big Sur,” Gibbard and Jay Farrar—of Son Volt and Uncle Tupelo fame—collaborate to craft a soundtrack to an upcoming documentary about Jack Kerouac’s 1967 novel “Big Sur.” Lyrics for the soundtrack are entirely drawn from the novel’s text, but while the project’s concept is intriguing, the album itself proves disappointing. Though certain tracks skillfully utilize the duo’s unique vocal talents, featuring pleasant enough instrumentation like rich piano and sultry bass, the album suffers from poorly chosen and sloppily crafted lyrics, which are often weakly delivered over uninspiring melodies.
“California Zephyr,” a song about traveling on a Western railway, opens the album, and uses simple, sunny guitar and Ben Gibbard’s lighthearted vocals to set the expansive, American West scene. A rambling, pleasantly repetitive tune, “Zephyr” conveys a good sense of movement, as one can almost imagine peacefully sitting on the eponymous train, humming this tune as fields and hills stretch by. The chorus—“I’m transcontinental / 3,000 miles from home / I’m on the California Zephyr / watching America roll by”—perfectly captures the spirit of travel and adventure that characterize Kerouac’s entire oeuvre.
Certain other tracks likewise skillfully utilize vocal talents: the deeper, twangier timbre of Jay Farrar enhances songs like “Low Life Kingdom.” The song, which details the depths of Kerouac’s alcohol- and madness-induced depression, puts Farrar’s gritty, alt-country manner to good use. When he wails “I’m gonna die in full despair / and wake up where the atmosphere / is dearer and maybe closer to heaven,” one senses the raw desperation of a man on the edge of sanity.
“Willamine” starts strong with Gibbard’s hauntingly high vocals and a lovely, purposeful piano. Disappointingly, though, these rich, heavy piano chords fail to lead into anything more than mere pseudo-romantic whining. With lyrics like “We’re gonna get married / we’re gonna fly away,” the song evidently aspires to be a sweeping ballad of young love, but winds up just sounding more like an anthem of teen angst.
Frustratingly, a number of songs use poorly-chosen passages from the novel to create banal lyrics. For instance, on the track “These Roads Don’t Move” lines like “These roads don’t move / You’re the one that moves,” are surely meant to feel prophetic, but instead just feel insipid. As anyone even vaguely familiar with Beat literature can attest, Kerouac’s writing offers more beautifully composed images than those selected by Gibbard and Farrar to depict in song.
Unsurprisingly, the album’s haphazardly culled lyrics often resemble an incongruous mishmash of words that aspire to poetry, but largely remain trite and poorly-culled from the original text. Even if one didn’t know the lyrics were patchworked from a novel, it’s easy to tell that the songs are at least somewhat internally disconnected, as each tune fails to tell a complete story and doesn’t quite form a lyrically unified whole.
As a number of unskillful, uninspired songs demonstrate, the album’s collaborators largely failed at matching their individual musical strengths with the different moods of the album. Specifically, Gibbard’s sensitive and delicately emotive voice is best suited to melancholy and thoughtful melodies. By contrast, Farrar’s deeper, rougher twang enlivens gritty, hard-up tracks, but his nasally drawl drags down slower paced songs, making them sound whiny, not wistful. On the whole, this album, though fortified by a few well-crafted tracks, fails to adroitly engage its source text and the vocal talents of its creators.

“Can I turn into a bat and stuff?” wonders starry-eyed Darren Shan (Chris Massoglia), the newest vampire-adolescent to hop aboard the young-adult bloodsucker bandwagon. “No,” replies his vampire mentor, the cloaked and mysterious Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly), “that’s bullshit.” This is not the only instance in Paul Weitz’s new film, “Cirque du Freak: The Vampire’s Assistant,” in which Crepsley correctly associates his young apprentice with tedium, puerility, or just bullshit. In fact, the film is driven by leading adult figures who barely tolerate the unfortunate ingénues who have stumbled into the limelight of the film. Though it consciously perpetuates hackneyed young-adult characters and themes, “Cirque du Freak” is saved by elders who can poke fun at the film’s driest conventions while also providing a compelling set of quirks and superpowers.
Based on the first three books of a 12-part fantasy series by Darren Shan, who lends his name to the protagonist, “Cirque du Freak” is a world glaringly divided between ill-at-ease paranormal teens and charming adult mutants. This former clique constantly threatens to pull the production into the black hole of young-adult drivel.
The main storyline chronicles the dissolution of the close friendship between the straitlaced and ultra-successful Darren and the rebellious, insecure Steve (Josh Hutcherson). Each teen deals with his own emotional baggage: Darren fends off the suffocation of his upper-middle class suburban milieu and his father’s chant of “College! Job! Family!” while Steve copes with an absent father and an alcoholic mother.
But after the best friends attend a freak show, steal a rare and deadly spider, and run away from home, they become mortal enemies and join the long dormant war between the good and evil vampire sects: the Vampires and the Vampaneze. Darren casts off his Sperry topsiders in exchange for a red leather jacket, joins the freak show, and meets the inevitable circus love interest. While Darren woos his half-monkey, half-frumpy high-school freakheart, Steve joins the dark side and starts killing former teachers. When their final dramatic confrontation takes place, Steve explains to Darren with comic seriousness that the Vampaneze think he’s “awesome”: “They say I have a destiny, or whatever.” Like many of their interactions, this climactic meeting induces more second-hand awkwardness than it does tension.
Thankfully, the cinematography and set provide ample relief from the humdrum plot. A whirling and occasionally unfocused camera heightens the camp of the freak show, filled with the patchwork tents and car parts that form the wandering circus’ home. This cozy shantytown contrasts perfectly with the imposing black car of the evil Desmond “Mr.” Tiny (Michael Cerveris), whose license plate, “Des-Tiny,” is one of the film’s many ingratiating flourishes.
The cornerstone of “Cirque du Freak” is a fantastic and animated set of adult characters who keep their own hairbrained discussions of vampire world war to a minimum in order to make room for mesmerizing, impeccably choreographed fight scenes and memorable wisecracking. Salma Hayek shines as Madame Truska, a voluptuous bearded lady who falls into deep clairvoyant trances, uttering “disaster” and “destruction” in cryptic tones only to promptly return to consciousness and perkily ask, “What did I say?” Truska is engaging and whimsical where Darren and Steve are ponderous and uncomfortable, and Weitz does a wonderful job combining the character’s vaudevillian lingerie and spontaneous beard-growth. The little-known Cerveris—most recognizable as The Observer on Fox’s popular drama, “Fringe”—delivers an equally captivating performance as the grosteque, blubbery villain Mr. Tiny. Donning refined opera binoculars and an affected air, Mr. Tiny refuses to engage in the ongoing war around him but makes his allegiances clear with his ominous mumblings (“One does dream of the cataclysm”).  Cerveris succeeds at establishing both a comedic and disturbing presence: though his absurd size and mannerisms are laughable, a real threat is clearly lurking in his insouciance of speech and action.
But above all others it is John C. Reilly who steals the show. Clad in a flowing red cape and tight showman pants, Reilly as Crepsley manages to control the flow of the plot without sullying himself in its clichés. In addition to supplying the quips that help to develop the comedic aspects of the film, Crepsley’s cynicism also provides alternative messages to the film’s more obvious moral points about diversity: as a vampire who has lived for 200 years, he philosophizes that “life may be meaningless, but death I still have hope for.” In these sober moments, Reilly showcases his great range, moving beyond his comic roles in “Step Brothers” and “Talladega Nights,” and lifting the film to a more elevated register.
“Cirque du Freak” is quirky and winning, a light-hearted standout in the otherwise dark and dramatic vampire craze sparked by the heavy-handed moralizing of “Twilight.” Ignoring the soul-searching gaze of any teen who shuffles across the screen, Weitz’s film is just as wondrous a freak show as the circus that is its subject.

Motherhood didn’t quite work out for Uma Thurman when she was Quentin Tarantino’s yellow-suited Bride in “Kill Bill.” But in writer-director Katherine Dieckmann’s latest low-budget undertaking, Thurman finally gets a shot at The Bride’s fiercest unfulfilled dream: to give birth to and raise a child of her own.
Her character is Eliza, a West Village misfit and ex-writer-turned-mommy trying to maintain a marriage, two children, and some semblance of creative vitality—not to mention sanity—amidst the chaos that is the existence of a stay-at-home mom. The film follows Eliza through an exceptionally tumultuous day of blogging,  blacktops, and birthday preparations.
Thurman’s Eliza is immediately compelling because she seems to lack the trappings of most stay-at-home movie moms. She’s not utterly selfless or wise, nor does she worship her children or possess a burning desire to appear perfect to the outside world. In between dropping her children off at school and uploading her musings to her blog, “The Bjorn Identity,” she grapples with her workaholic husband (Anthony Edwards) and her pregnant, sex-deprived best friend (Minnie Driver). She may be grouchy and stretched thin, but she is stubborn and passionate, and she can pull off long, old-maid dresses better than anyone except perhaps a pregnant Heidi Klum. Dieckmann is wise to lend the character both autonomous ambitions and myriad whims; Eliza comes to represent every mother who has dreamt of driving right past the exit on the way home—except she’s bolder because she actually does it.
Unfortunately, most of what feels genuine and true about Thurman’s character is lacking in the film’s narrative. Eliza’s day begins ordinarily enough as she buys groceries and party decorations for her daughter’s sixth birthday party, later deciding to enter a writing contest in which she must describe the essence of motherhood in 500 words or less. As the day wears on, however, it feels as though Dieckmann piles a whole life’s worth of unfortunate events into the few hours she has. Soon enough Eliza has had a minor breakdown, a confusing interaction with a sexy younger delivery boy, and an enormous fight with her best friend. She has also saved her child’s life over the phone. The situational humor in all this tends to fall flat, and the bleak accumulation of incident after incident comes close to reducing this movie to cautionary tale—the cinematic equivalent of birth control.
When viewed as an ode to New York, however, the film takes on new and energetic light. Hipster bakeries, loudmouthed pedestrians giving anyone and everyone a piece of their mind, alternate side parking, cramped rent-stabilized apartments, class envy and entitlement, annoying tourists—the movie spares no detail in its panoramic coverage of the busiest city in the world. The film’s New York setting enhances the tumult of Eliza’s many mishaps, and provides moments of unexpected fun—most notably Jodie Foster’s hilarious cameo as a fellow mom navigating the dangerous world of urban playground politics.
Motherhood certainly agrees with Thurman, who is mom to two kids by ex-husband Ethan Hawke. At the cusp of 40, she looks radiant even with disheveled brown hair and non-sexy librarian glasses. The action hero goddess is virtually unrecognizable, but there’s something strangely appealing about how dysfunctional the 6-foot-tall Thurman looks running around in her tattered aprons and dorky Birkenstocks. Motherhood for Eliza is ultimately about accepting limitations on her time and energy, and learning slowly that children are what motivate her to live a passionate life. Thurman fully embraces the many facets of her character, taking on her struggles with wit, strength, and enthusiasm. Eliza may not wield the hefty sword of the Bride, but in Dieckmann’s vision she is just as brave.

There is something very disconcerting about the first scenes of “Amelia.” The new Amelia Earhart biopic from director Mira Nair ’79 opens with a soft, hopeful score to accompany Earhart—played with wit and charisma by Hilary Swank—on her first trip across the Atlantic Ocean; the year is 1928, and Earhart’s airplane swoops gently over the vast seascapes and mountains of clouds. In “Amelia,” flying is about freedom and joy, an attitude completely forgotten in our modern age, with its long security queues and, since 9/11, vague sense of menace. Today, Earhart’s career is incomprehensible—her solo flights, undertaken simply to set records and to gain publicity, may be viewed with suspicion by audiences unfamiliar with her life before her infamous disappearance.
“How could she be so reckless?” we ask, with perfect hindsight. “Is it reckless?” Earhart responds in the film. “Maybe, but what do dreams know of boundaries?”
At times it seems that “Amelia” is as much about this kind of rosy optimism, and the era that spawned it, as it is about the woman. Set during the Great Depression, the film is, nonetheless, pure escapism, offering the glamour of this summer’s “Public Enemies” without the grit. A perilous moment on one of Earhart’s flights is never excessively troubling; somehow she always escapes the danger and lands among fawning crowds or the occasional confused shepherd. She pursues her ambition to be a “vagabond of the air” without fear, barreling through the obstacles of poverty, peril, and gender bias. Nair ignores not only the connotations that air travel has acquired in recent years but also the incredulity that Earhart’s consuming ambition will inspire in viewers given last year’s financial collapse. We no longer live in Earhart’s era of optimism, passion, and, yes, recklessness. But even with its predetermined ending, “Amelia” does not come across as a cautionary tale; it is homage to a time very similar to ours, save from its refrain from skepticism in order to maintain hope.
Although Nair’s films—from “Salaam Bombay!” to “Monsoon Wedding”—have garnered widespread acclaim from the media, she is a populist at heart, playing more to the audience here than to the critics. This is not a bad thing; although some might find the constant swelling of tympanis and the inconsistent quality of the digital effects to be grating and cheesy, these are forgivable and do not detract from the meaning or pleasure of the movie. Nair’s affinity for the common man also works to her benefit; the crowd scenes are executed with meticulous attention to detail and the extras are allowed to act, a surprising touch in a film with so many high-profile stars.
When Earhart and her future husband George Putnam (Richard Gere) walk to the train station together after meeting for the first time, a trio of rowdy soldiers joking in the background goes a long way in placing the timeless sentimentality of such a encounter in 1927. Wherever Earhart stops for fuel, the camera lingers in close-up on the children who greet her. Her feats inspired a nation in a way that modern figures rarely can, and the children she meets—including a young Gore Vidal—function as silent narrators of her story.
But “Amelia” also introduces us to a more troubled and indecisive character than the one we know from newsreels. Although Earhart is unequivocal about flying, she is often unsure of herself in her relationship with Putnam, and this is where Swank’s talent makes itself most known. Earhart is perfectly comfortable speaking to the press, but she is all awkward limbs and skittishness when meeting Putnam for the first time. After they are married, she submits to his urges to make more publicity appearances because she does not know what else to do; the financial backing for her flights must come from somewhere, and so she squeezes her sprawling personality into advertisements for everything from cameras to a clothing line. Although Earhart’s triumphant press conferences and bold declarations of freedom made her a celebrity in her time and a legend in ours, Swank is best in times of conflict and uncertainty; in one such scene, there is even an ironic tribute to “Patton” for those watching closely.
Despite the degree to which Nair is able to flesh out the aviatrix’s life, Amelia’s primary trait remains her desire to be “transported to a safe, beautiful place where everything is comprehensible.” She gets there through flight, but for those of us hampered by FAA regulations, “Amelia” offers an opportunity for the same experience. It is visually sumptuous, easy to understand, and endowed with the simple romanticism of a Capra film that Earhart might have watched herself. With any other director, it might have become a dark and melodramatic Hilary Swank vehicle. And although some will criticize “Amelia” for not being that, perhaps this is just the kind of film we needed right now.

“I think it’s interesting that people assume that motherhood isn’t worth a complex portrait in film,” says Katherine Dieckmann. The indie director—whose previous credits include directing Paul Rudd in “Diggers” and R.E.M. in the “Shiny Happy People” video—attempts to remedy this fact with her new film, “Motherhood.” The film marks a departure for Uma Thurman, who plays the protagonist, Eliza, a harried Manhattan mother who struggles to throw her daughter’s birthday party and compete in an essay contest during the same difficult day. In a recent roundtable interview, both Dieckmann and Thurman shared their thoughts on the importance of honestly depicting everyday family life, the challenges of parenting in an urban environment, and the seemingly female-centric film’s broader appeal.
Given the vast array of previous family-focused films, Dieckmann strove to create a realistic yet complex portrait of motherhood. “I felt, as a filmmaker, very frustrated with the lack of multidimensional mothers on film,” Dieckmann says. She didn’t want to create a suburban family comedy (“We’ve seen that movie,” she explains), nor did she aim to produce yet another film about a mother’s psychological crisis. “I didn’t want [to portray] the mother who’s dealing with a drug problem, or a suicidal child,” she says. “I wanted an everyday mother.”
And an urban one, too; the film takes place in the heart of New York City’s bustling Greenwich Village. Despite the fact that most young families reside in suburban or rural areas, Dieckmann and Thurman were determined to capture the unique challenges of raising a child in the city. “The urban environment makes a mother’s challenges more hyperbolic,” Dieckmann explains. Thurman, too, appreciated the film’s treatment of the difficulties encountered when starting a family in a metropolis. “The urban environment is actively antagonistic to family life,” she says. “You and your baby are the last thing that anyone cares about.”
To illustrate this point, Thurman jumps to her feet and begins to pantomime a story from her own life. “Once when I was pregnant, I was at the theatre and I went to the bathroom during intermission,” she explains as she lunges forward, arms outstretched to emphasize the expanse of her girth. “Four other women saw how pregnant I was, and thinking that I would take a long time in the bathroom, ran ahead of me to get there first! It’s just unbelievable how cruel people in cities can be toward families.”
In the film, Eliza meets with many similar roadblocks, from getting her car towed to schlepping groceries by bicycle through the streets of Manhattan. To create these moments, the director drew on experiences from her own life. “I went through almost everything in this film,” Dieckmann attests. “Magnolia Bakery did misspell my daughter’s name on her birthday cake, and refused to fix it, and film crews did disrupt traffic to film on my street.”
Given the film’s clearly gender-oriented title and theme, one might wonder if its intended audience is limited to middle-aged women who’ve endured the hardships of parenting. The short answer, both women quickly assert, is no. Dieckmann—an assistant professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of the Arts—screened the film for many of her male graduate students during post-production. Just as she hoped, even the unmarried, childless, 20-something males in her classes still appreciated the humor and honesty of the film. Thurman dismisses the idea that only women would seek out the film. “When you watch ‘Sid and Nancy,’ is that movie just for druggies?” she asks. “I mean, I watch films about men. Sometimes they’re boring, but when someone does something well, I want to see it, not because I’m a woman or a man, but because I’m a human being.”
Indeed, at its heart, the film is as much a meditation upon the rapid pace of city life as it is an ode to the exhausting yet rewarding experience of being a mother. Musing on the fleeting nature of both a child’s formative years and the ever-changing urban landscape, Thurman grows introspective. “When you’re with your child, you’re in this moment, you’re holding on to it, but the world is changing all around you,” she says. “They’re changing your coffee shop, your playground, your neighborhood—and all you want is to have this moment with your child.”

The opening of “Dead Man’s Cell Phone” has the suspicious feel of a playwright’s practical joke. A woman sits alone at a café table. A well-dressed man sits very still at another. Suddenly his cell phone rings, at which point everyone in the theatre looks around to see which poor soul forgot to shut theirs off. It takes a few rings before they realize this is actually the first sound of the show they just paid to watch. After countless performances interrupted by inconsiderate spectators’ beeping and jingling pockets, this particular production and its crew have finally turned the tables on the audience. This is but the first of many winks that Sarah Ruhl’s playful script—being performed by The Lyric Stage Company of Boston through Nov. 14—has in store.
As the man’s phone continues to ring on the tabletop, Jean (Liz Hayes), the young woman at the next table, comes over to ask politely that its owner silence it. She quickly discovers that the reason he refuses to answer the phone or her demure entreaties is that he is quite dead. Jean cries out for help several times, then uses the phone to call emergency services, telling them—and the audience—in answer to the obvious question: “There seems to be no one working at this café!” Wink. The play is not afraid to laugh at its own conventions, and, indeed, it revels in them. Director Carmel O’Reilly delights in having her actors talk half to each other and half to her viewers, to great effect.
Jean turns out to be an irrepressible, earnest soul—so much so, in fact, that she takes on the dead man’s phone as a charge and proceeds to invent deathbed incidents to console grieving relatives and acquaintances. The deceased is revealed to be Gordon Gottlieb (Neil McGarry), a rather well-to-do businessman who seems to have been more engaged by his money than the people around him. Jean proceeds to weave narratives of comfort for Gordon’s estranged mother (Beth Gotha), embittered wife Hermia (Bryn Jameson, in a wonderful supporting effort), and his vain, insecure mistress (Jessica Turner).
This first part of the play is carried almost entirely by Hayes’ effervescent performance, her boundless enthusiasm overcoming the assorted awkward situations she gets herself into. Jean is the sort of person who can apologize for Mrs. Gottlieb’s verbal abuse of her, explaining to Gordon’s brother, an embarrassed Dwight (Jeff Mahoney), that “People are usually nice, deep down, in the right circumstances, at the right time. I think your mother’s just in the wrong circumstances, at the very wrong time.”
But it is after these preliminary encounters that the play truly comes into its own, beginning with a masterful monologue by the departed Gordon, who stalks the stage as though he owns it while recounting the events of his last day. This metaphysical materialization isn’t surprising—prominently featured in the production’s playbill, actor Neil McGarry is not just there to play dead—but it is inspired. Indeed, McGarry is the other shining star of this production, exuding charisma and likability despite being undeniably arrogant and domineering. Bringing back the dead man to tell his true story after it has just been charmingly rewritten by an outsider turns the play on its head and provides new and unexpected life. The audience is given notice: the story has officially become unpredictable.
The production pulls off an unlikely grab bag of novelties—kung fu, ice skating, and a letterpress among them—with whimsy and good humor, never taking itself so seriously as to become incapable of surprising its audience. On the small Lyric Stage Company set, creative lighting (under the direction of John Malinowski) serves to evoke such varied locales as the sterile café, a somber funeral chapel, and the sunlit bench upon which Jean meets an aggrieved friend of the deceased. Music is largely transitional, but the incessant ring of Gordon’s cell phone—the most important sound of all and a character in its own right—is spot on.
Ultimately, “Dead Man’s Cell Phone” is more witty than profound. It has not so much subtext as text messaged bits of comic cleverness. But compellingly quirky lead performances and an unlikely, surprisingly sentimental story make this production a success. If not a life-changing experience, it’s the sort of friendly, life-affirming conversation of which our best days are made.

Technological literacy has become a standard in the modern workforce, and in the future it stands to increase in importance as the world moves into a wired era. The Uruguayan government has shown that it is very attuned to this fact, and its efforts to provide one laptop to every public primary-school child in Uruguay proves that it is paying the future due heed. The XO model laptops, which are currently being distributed, were developed for Uruguay in conjunction with the One Laptop Per Child organization.
The Uruguayan program, which will provide hundreds of thousands of laptops to Uruguay’s schoolchildren, does so at a reasonable initial cost of $260 per child plus $21 per year per child to maintain the program. At less than $300 per child and less than five percent of Uruguay’s total education budget, their government has managed to give the country’s youth a chance to become technologically proficient in a world where a basic understanding of technology is quickly becoming a prerequisite to success.
The structure of the program has less tangible, but still important, benefits to children beyond the fact that it grants them access to technological literacy. Providing children with laptops of their own gives them a sense of agency that simply cannot be achieved through computer labs or computer classes alone. Personal ownership gives these children the ability to access a wealth of information about themselves and their surroundings outside of the classroom as well.
The program must overcome several obstacles, like training less technologically adept teachers to use the computers in classrooms and providing adequate Internet access. There will likely be problems with maintaining the computers and making sure that students have access to new computers when some of the machines inevitably meet an untimely end. As The Economist notes, “When poor, rural children wreck theirs, they often prefer to keep their new status symbol clutched to their chests than risk the postal service not returning it promptly from the central maintenance centre.” These concerns will need to be addressed quickly.
Yet the Uruguayan effort is a work in progress and demonstrates a far-sighted outlook on the part of the government that is admirable. Uruguay, of course, has other serious problems that will need to be addressed in order to maintain the welfare of its citizens. However, concern for other, perhaps more pressing, issues should not paralyze progress or prevent the country from tackling the clear lack of access to technology or high-quality education. Moreover, the Uruguayan solution should be emulated by similarly capable and equipped nations for the benefit of future generations. This is insurance for posterity and a victory for progress.

With less than a month to go before the Harvard-Yale Game on Nov. 21, there is an almost universal acknowledgment among Harvard students that The Game’s presence at Yale this year is sure to mean fewer intrusive rules and more fun.
Last year, while claiming to bring tailgating at The Game more in line with the rules for other university sporting events, Harvard and the City of Boston mandated all tailgating to cease by kickoff, two quarters earlier than in previous years. This announcement came on the heels of 2004’s banning of kegs, U-Hauls, and Winnebagos and prohibition on any individual bringing more than 20 gallons of beer or one gallon of hard alcohol.
Yale’s regulations, which were released recently, permit kegs, which are more efficient from an environmental perspective, and allow tailgating to continue through the third quarter.
In future years, Harvard administrators would do well to follow Yale’s example, recognizing that, while student safety is important, the sense of camaraderie and social interaction between students and alumni that occurs both outside The Game is at the heart of what makes the event special. Harvard’s current regulations dampen school spirit by enhancing the sense of intrusion and mistrust for students by the administration and the police.
Furthermore, it makes little sense for Harvard’s restrictions to be more prohibitive than Yale’s: While Yale’s arena is located far from its campus, Harvard Stadium’s proximity to dorms guarantees that many students will simply return to campus after the tailgate ends early.
Some may posit that Harvard’s 2004 regulations have resulted in a decrease in hospitalizations, even though nine were still hospitalized at last year’s Game. But even if the new rules lead to a decline in hospitalizations, there is such a thing as compromising too much in the name of safety. Were there no tailgate at all, hospitalizations would surely decline further. The balance that Yale strikes between fun and safety is more sensible than that prevailing at Harvard.

Places I’ve lost an umbrella: the T, the trunk of someone else’s car, A-entryway of Winthrop House, H-entryway of Winthrop House, the dining hall of Winthrop House, an airplane. I would estimate my total losses of umbrellas in the last 10 years to be roughly 15. God only knows how many I lost as a baby. Some of them were really special, too—one that I’d had since eighth grade, and fondly called “Ducky,” featured a duck’s head as the handle. Ducky’s glass eyes were cracked and the red paint had chipped off his beak by last year, but I still cherished him. He was the A-entryway casualty. Then, one of my good friends bought me an umbrella for my birthday, specifically because she knows that I never have one. I lost it the next day riding the Blue Line to the aquarium.
Where all of my former umbrellas are, I have no idea. They have entered into the nebulous vortex of lost umbrellas—probably someone in the Financial District is enjoying one right now. But I’m not bitter. That’s because I take other people’s umbrellas.
“Now wait a second! Isn’t that stealing?” Well, friends, not exactly. You see, I don’t take people’s umbrellas that they clearly haven’t forgotten, having merely laid them aside. I don’t make George’s mistake in “Seinfeld” of thinking that the umbrellas in the metal cans at coffee shops are free. I only take umbrellas that are indubitably lost, like the one I took last week from my section room, which had been forlornly flung into a corner for some time. Since I have contributed so many umbrellas to the great Karmic Circle of Lost Precipitation Inhibitors, I feel that I can justifiably take others that I find. It’s just like those little give-a-penny, take-a-penny trays by cash registers, except with the necessary element of forgetfulness.
Umbrellas belong to a special class of items. They are vastly useful to everyone, but, unlike their size-specific cousin, the raincoat, they are not individualized. There are no “left-handed” umbrellas or “gluten-free” umbrellas. They are the everyman of protection from the elements. Consider the case of a lost pencil. You are rummaging in your bag to surreptitiously text someone, but then your eyes dart to an abandoned light-green pencil right under your seat. Of course you take it. Who is going to frantically come running into the classroom bawling over a lost pencil?  Umbrellas and pencils both belong to that anonymously ubiquitous class of items; umbrellas simply cost $20 instead of 20 cents.
If you see me walking in the Yard on a rainy 45-degree day, which would mean anytime in March, under what seems to look suspiciously like that umbrella you lost in the Science Center, don’t worry. It probably is. But never fear, I have a feeling you’ll find another one if you just keep an eye out in Lamont Café.

Now that a runoff is finally in the works in Afghanistan (for an election they held in August!), the Obama administration will have to make up its mind in the next several weeks on the recommendations of the McChrystal Report, which argues for sending in  40,000 or more additional soldiers. The choice comes down to whether America wants to focus on counter-terror operations—keeping troop levels constant and instead using target bombs and drones to prevent al-Qaeda from fully reconstituting—or counter insurgency, which is what we did in Iraq and involves a far greater investment in troops, time, and money but might one day result in a stable Afghan state.
As things stand, the United States spends $60 billion a year waging war in Afghanistan, and, depending on whose estimates you trust, a surge would cost between $10 and $40 billion all by itself. In 2008, there were 32,000 troops deployed in Afghanistan; now there are around 68,000. A troop surge on the scale that General Stanley McChrystal, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, is asking for would push us past the 100,000 mark in a war that has been going on for longer than America fought in the Civil War and World War II combined.
Leading Republicans, who represent themselves as deficit hawks when opposing Obama’s domestic initiatives, now accuse him of “dithering” on Afghanistan. This whole episode looks like it will work out extremely well for Republicans. If Obama doubles down, as they want, the best that can be hoped for is an extended and expensive struggle that will be unpopular, especially with the president’s base on the left. If he doesn’t, he, not his predecessor who waged the war so poorly for the last seven years, will be the person who “lost” Afghanistan. Unless Obama decides to get creative.
Assuming, as the smart money is betting, that Obama pursues an Afghan surge, why not propose a surtax on the wealthiest Americans to pay for it and, for that matter, to pay for the entire Afghan war from this point forward?  Such a tax could be deferred a year or two until we’ve emerged more from the recession so bad economic timing wouldn’t have to be an issue. How better to send the message that (1) certain things have to be done, even though they cost money; (2) increasing the deficit in the short term is inevitable because of the Great Recession; but (3) long-term initiatives should be deficit-neutral because the deficit is a threat to our future welfare. Such a plan could be proposed in Obama’s next budget, although he could make known his intention to propose it when he announces the surge. This may have the added plus of helping to mitigate some of the inevitable disillusionment of the left when he does so.
Ballooning federal debt will be a big theme, maybe the biggest, advanced by Republicans in the midterm elections. To counter the impression Republicans are trying to create that universal health care is going to grow the deficit, Obama has wisely made this claim a tough sell by insisting that health-care reform be deficit neutral. Why not take something that Republicans currently are clamoring for, in spite of the fact that it costs a staggering amount of money, and force them to prove their fiscal-conservative bona fides? Surely, the Republicans will oppose any surtax and lose a lot of their deficit-hawk street cred in the process, while Obama, for better or worse, can be branded as “Mr. Deficit-Neutral.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prior to the randomization of housing assignments, residential communities were regrettably homogeneous, though consequently vibrant: Your house largely defined who you were on campus, especially when drinking rules were lax and final clubs a marginal part of campus culture. When the lottery system finally began in 1996, the College failed to address the weakening effects on house spirit that randomly sorting an increasingly (and thankfully) dissimilar student body would induce. It was and still is unrealistic to expect that a dormitory assigned through lottery can become the most meaningful community in a majority of students’ lives, regardless of how many pool tables you put in a JCR. So, while last April’s Report on Housing Renovation contained insightful and conscientious recommendations, I propose one more suggestion that would fundamentally restructure how we think about residential life at Harvard: House all the sophomores in the Quad.
University Hall’s first reaction is usually less than optimistic when it comes to new ideas, so it is worthwhile to address some of the natural counterarguments to the proposal. I realize that turning the Quad into sophomore housing would fundamentally alter house life on Linnaean Street, and I would argue that this change is for the better. The Quad would transform, certainly, but the vibrant sense of community that has been its hallmark would survive and flourish with a new and enthusiastic network of sophomores each year. And for those really concerned about the future of the Quad houses, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but its life expectancy is short anyway: Once construction in Allston is complete, the College plans to stop housing undergraduates noth of Cambridge Common.
Another criticism of Quadding second-year students argues that isolating them would reduce meaningful interaction between sophomores, juniors, and seniors. When I talk to most undergraduates about their time on campus, though, I see that their friendships with older students form primarily in communities outside the house. Most sophomores do not immediately befriend wizened seniors in the dining hall, and most seniors do not bother taking the time to meet the new crop of sophomores while waiting hours for their resumes to upload to CrimsonCareers. While this is not true for all students, I challenge the majority of current juniors and seniors to name more than a few significant sophomore friendships they’ve made in their houses. In reality, more “intergenerational” friendships form in extracurriculars than over an awkward meal of popcorn chicken.
The truth of the matter is that the sort of randomized relationships that should exist in a truly diverse community are most common amongst classmates of the same year; sophomores are far more likely to sit with a table of unknown 2012ers than they are to approach an unfamiliar group of seniors. Unfortunately, the heterogeneous friendship networks that characterize freshman year seem to fade away with the geographic and social pressures that come the year after. Geographic proximity would preserve and create some of those elusive diverse social networks, putting the sophomores in the same dining halls, on the same shuttles, and in the same common spaces.
Moreover, housing all sophomores in the Quad would create an upperclassman environment on the river conducive to dorm-wide socialization at stein clubs, parties, and meals. Although it would be regrettable for students to only spend two years in their final housing assignments, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks: Among other advantages, the proposed system would centralize currently lackluster sophomore advising. Attractively for the administration, the proposal could also solve an upcoming, thorny issue—housing renovations. Since the Quad currently contains 1,200 students (most in singles that could be doubles), fitting 1,600 sophomores into the Quad would yield a surplus of approximately 400 open beds on the river, the size of an average house. (If this crowding were to prove unpalatable to the powers that be, the administration could convert the failed SOCH into housing.) Harvard would be able to maintain current standards of living during housing reconstruction without purchasing a costly “swing house,” and housing renovations could start sooner than expected.
The social and equity benefits of the proposed system prove even more salient than these logistical concerns. As a frequent visitor to the Quad (my closest friends and extracurriculars always met in Cabot and Hilles), I have come to appreciate its benefits of space and inconveniences of distance. So, while I do not favor river life over Quad life, I think it is fair to say that they are fundamentally different experiences. By Quadding sophomores, we would expose all undergraduates to both types of living.  Additionally, the system would encourage students to meet new groups of friends over a longer period of time, perhaps combating the unfortunate social fossilization that currently characterizes sophomore fall. Combining this recommendation with the suggestions of last April’s housing report would revitalize house life, balancing some of the negative effects that have accompanied changes in residential life policies over the past decade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing the fiscal year saddled with an unprecedented $6 billion in debt, Harvard may borrow even more money this year to sustain various capital projects across campus, the University’s chief financial officer said last week.
Harvard spent $644 million this past fiscal year—which ended June 30—on a capital program that included new construction, acquisitions, and existing physical infrastructure, according to the University’s annual financial report released last Friday.
“We’re focusing very intensively on where we can reduce the scale and pacing of our capital projects to match our new resources,” said Dan Shore, Harvard’s chief financial officer, in an interview last Friday. But he noted that even a “shrunken down” series of capital expenditures would remain sizable simply due to the University’s large size, and that as a result, “at some point during the next year or so we could be going to market again [for more debt].”
In early 2008, the University broke ground on the Allston Science Complex—a facility aimed at promoting interdisciplinary science, rumored to boast an eventual pricetag of $1 billion—but announced in February that it would slow construction and reconsider the pace and design of the project. In the meantime, the University has pushed forward on expansion and renovation projects at the Harvard Art Museum, Law School, and Arnold Arboretum.
A credit rating report issued by Moody’s Investors Service in April said that Harvard was considering halving its capital spending and new debt issuance due to investment losses. The report said that Harvard had previously planned on issuing $3 billion in new debt over the next few years to fund campus expansions, in addition to spending roughly $1 billion a year on capital projects.
Shore said that debt has allowed Harvard to expand its campus in “programmatically critical” ways in the past, and that Harvard must now “carefully” manage and service that debt. According to the University’s recent financial report, Harvard’s principal payments on debt are expected to increase sharply over the next few years.
The total value of Harvard’s debt increased by almost $2 billion last year as the University issued new debt to refinance old debt and to provide extra cash flexibility amidst sudden budgetary turmoil. As a result of the new debt, the University’s interest payments increased by $58 million this past year, the report said, from $146 million to $204 million.
After the University’s endowment lost $11 billion this past year—falling to $26 billion—Harvard’s endowment assets now outnumber its debt by a factor of four, compared to a factor of nine last year.
Shore said that many of Harvard’s peers have asset-to-debt ratios that mirror the University’s current situation, and he noted that credit agencies have maintained Harvard’s ‘AAA’ rating despite the bond sales. Most elite institutions have also retained their top-notch credit ratings, although a number of other colleges did find themselves downgraded this year.
“Our objective still is maintaining our ‘AAA’ rating,” Shore said. “Before we take out any more debt we’d be in conversation with the ratings agencies to tell them our story and to make them comfortable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like most of the investment community, Harvard’s vaunted economists were hit hard by the recent financial crisis and ensuing downturn.
Textbook magnate N. Gregory Mankiw’s stock portfolio dipped. Economics department chair and hedge fund adviser John Y. Campbell got out too early. Even conservative investor Claudia Goldin suffered a drop in her retirement fund.
And while investors around the world scrambled to get out of risky investments, the mega-minds at Harvard took a more reserved approach—they stuck to their strategy.
None of the three academics interviewed for this article acknowledged spending much time checking the stock listings. 
But for those pursuing more active investment strategies, all three classroom superstars agreed, less is more.
PRINCIPLES OF INVESTING
“I am a long-term buy-and-hold investor, as I don’t think I am smart enough to time the market,” says the professor of the largest economics course at Harvard and author of “Principles of Economics.”
Mankiw has gained national prominence through his popular textbooks and as one of President George W. Bush’s chief economic advisers. 
But outsmarting the markets, Mankiw says, requires huge quantities of time poring over listings—time that he says he prefers to devote to academic pursuits. 
Mankiw’s simple investment portfolio consists of about two-thirds stocks and one-third bonds, balancing what he considers the high risk of equities with more dependable fixed income. 
Even when his portfolio took a hit during the crisis, he maintained the ratio by investing more cash into stocks in order to compensate for what he had lost in the market decline. This “rebalancing” is Mankiw’s main active portfolio strategy. Otherwise, he says, he is relatively passive. 
He believes in the higher risk and returns of equities, but his stock investments are widely diversified, including international holdings, and are mostly in low-cost index funds. 
Mankiw practices what he preaches in his textbook. “I don’t think anyone should put all their money in a company they work for, or in the country they happen to live in,” he says. He is invested not only in the U.S. but also in Europe, Asia, and emerging markets.
AN ACTIVE ADVISER
Economics Department Chair Campbell, who specializes in asset pricing, is no stranger to active investing. 
He is on a short list of Harvard economists also advising in the private sector, contributing his expertise at the hedge fund Arrow Street Capital. And, as a member of the Harvard Management Company, he is the only economics professor at Harvard helping to oversee the largest private endowment in the world.  
But when it comes to his own money, Campbell sticks to what he knows best. Despite a more hands-on methodology, he acknowledges that “most of the time, letting it sit there and not worrying about it is the best approach.”
Campbell avoids stocks—not his expertise, he says—and focuses on less risky assets. His conservative strategy dates back to the mid-90s, when he says he and his Yale adviser Robert J. Shiller predicted that the booming market would cool off. 
Unfortunately for Campbell, his prediction was a few years ahead of the market, and he missed out on the gains of the late ’90s.
But the tech bust in the beginning of the decade would eventually prove him right, and his investments remained safe. 
With the recent rebound of the stock market, Campbell says stocks are looking more attractive. And young people are in the best position to invest, he says, because their capital lies mostly in future earnings. On the other hand, most do not have the job security of a tenured professor. “I have one of the safest jobs you can have,” he admits.
PLAYING IT SAFE
Claudia Goldin, professor of economics and director of the National Bureau of Economics Research’s Development of the American Economy program, comes from “a family of people who are not risk takers,” she said. 
As an economic historian specializing in labor economics, Goldin is well-versed in the history of hard times.
Appropriately, her approach is very low-risk. Nearly all of her investment capital is in conservative retirement funds. 
Goldin says she also keeps a lot of her money close to home.
“I’ve also hired lots of people in this time of economic recession by renovating two bathrooms,” she said. “How’s that for an economist trying to lift up the entire economy all by herself?”

Marking the start of the University’s Public Service Week on Monday, University President Drew G. Faust called upon the Harvard community to renew its commitment to service, as administrators seek to strengthen connections to career opportunities in the federal government.
Though it is unlikely Harvard will be committing new funds to promote public service initiatives given current fiscal constraints, Faust said in an interview earlier this week that the University has been in discussions with the federal government to improve its recruitment process at Harvard.
“We’re not looking at vast expansions of financial commitments,” Faust said. “It’s a time where we are thinking about other instrumentalities rather than expanding costs.”
Faust pointed to the Harvard Kennedy School’s efforts to work with the White House—in particular, the Office of Personnel Management—to improve its graduates’ prospects of working for government organizations at the national level.
According to the Kennedy School’s chief of staff Sarah E. Wald, roughly 60 percent of graduates each year choose careers in public service, whether in the federal government or at a non-profit organization.
Currently, students applying for federal government jobs are often left in limbo as they may have to wait for months before hearing back from potential employers, Wald said.

Currently, students applying for federal government jobs are often left in limbo as they may have to wait for months before hearing back from potential employers, Wald said.
By contrast, many financial services companies that recruit at the College allow students to apply through a standardized online form and then notify students of their progress after each stage of the process. So far, no formal agreements have come out of Harvard’s discussions with the White House, but administrators said they hope to streamline the recruitment process for government employers.“We’re working on trying to make the connection between students and public service careers smoother,” Faust said.
Last year, Harvard Law School went a step further in promoting public service careers as an attractive option for graduates by offering tuition waivers for third-year students who commit to working in public service for five years. This fall, according to Law School Director of Student Financial Services Kenneth H. Lafler, 58 third-year students have signed up for the initiative, which will be run for five years as a trial program, with a budget of $3 million per year.
Because the University is no longer in a position to fund such large-scale programs, Faust’s current focus is instead to draw positive attention to student projects and opportunities in public service.
In a Monday e-mail to the University community, Faust urged students, faculty, and staff to participate in service activities such as volunteering at the Greater Boston Food Bank.“Harvard students do so much with public service,” said Amanda S. Glynn, coordinator of the Center for Public Interest Careers. “To be able to shine a spotlight on that, to have that validation of public interest careers from the president of Harvard, is very exciting.”
Luci Yang ’11, administrative director of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, said she appreciated Faust’s support of service activities.“Especially in a down economy, it’s hard for nonprofits to get the funding they need,” Yang said. “It’s totally understandable she might not be able to commit to financial help.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Martin A. Samuels was growing up in the suburbs of Cleveland, a house call from his pediatrician J.W. Epstein was a big deal.
Samuels says his mother would make him take a shower and put on new clothes while waiting for Epstein’s old jalopy to come up the drive.
Whether Samuels was suffering from measles or the chicken pox, Epstein was always gentle and reassuring. “It was a very romanticized version of what a doctor was supposed to be,” says Samuels.
“I asked him one day, ‘Can you continue to take care of me now that I’m not a child anymore?’ and he replied, ‘I’ll take care of you until you’re a doctor’” recalls Samuels—now chief of neurology at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
For Samuels, Epstein was an ideal physician—skilled in both the scientific and the humane, interactive aspects of medicine.
But that model, he says, is fast disappearing as schools and hospitals increasingly prioritize teaching new medical technologies and clinical guidelines.
Such “evidenced-based” training has been a boon for medical care in a technical sense. But Samuels and colleagues like Medical School associate professor Katharine K. Treadway, who teaches a class at the Medical School called “Introduction to the Profession,” say they worry that the physician’s traditional focus on doctor-patient relationships has been lost amid the shuffle.
“What we don’t do enough of is helping students not just to make a diagnosis and not just to think about the treatment but also to think about what the experience is for the patient in terms of what I’m doing and what I can do to help,” Treadway says.
‘INSPIRED TO ACT’
In an effort to inspire physicians to internalize traditional values of medicine, Samuels used an old form of technology—the radio—to launch a program entitled “Inspired to Act.”
He helped develop the weekly XM Satellite Radio broadcast to highlight more personal aspects of medicine as a response to the heightened pressures doctors face today. Each week, Samuels chats with a guest picked because they “have done something inspiring in medicine,” such as improving clinical care in third-world countries or performing the world’s first kidney transplant.
“It’s just a fascinating program,” says Allan H. Ropper, who helped found the field of neurological intensive care and now serves as executive vice chair of neurology at Brigham and Women’s.
Ropper, who was featured on a segment about the traditional values of medicine, said he believes these values are “immemorial.”
“They revolve around putting the patient first, relieving their suffering,” Ropper says.
What has changed, he says, is how patients are treated.
Because he and Samuels were trained on far more primitive medical technology, Ropper says they benefited from a culture that placed a high premium on the judgment of the doctor.
“One of the ironies of modern technology is that it has made clinical care more expensive and devalued clinical judgment,” Ropper says.
If a patient comes in complaining of a headache, a neurologist who doesn’t find any symptoms after examination can no longer tell the patient, “I don’t find anything serious but you should come back in a few months if you’re still having problems,” Ropper says. Instead, for legal reasons, MRI images are taken to ensure that there really is nothing wrong and then every detail of the encounter must be logged electronically.
A ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIP
Samuels says he worries that this move towards “evidence-based medicine,” in which physicians adhere to pre-made treatment guidelines, will turn doctors into a sort of “functionary, who just sits by the computer and fills in the blanks”—a prospect he considers discomforting for patients.
“The doctor is often not even looking you in the eye, but he’s turned sideways and typing into a computer while you are trying to tell him something very personal, frightening, and important to you,” Samuels says.
When Epstein visited Samuels years ago, he would spend time talking to Samuels and reassure him with a pat on the back that “everything was going to be alright”—a bedside manner that Samuels says he still uses with his patients today.
“You can imagine how a patient would feel if they’re telling you about their husband’s recent diagnosis with lung cancer and you’re looking at the computer,” says Treadway, who teaches “Introduction to the Profession” at the Medical School.
Treadway adds that many medical students and doctors are so focused on diagnosing and treating the problem that they forget what the experience is like for the patient.
She recalls a time when she asked a group of residents who had just delivered a diagnosis of cancer whether any of them had asked the patient, “How are you doing with this?”
One of the senior residents answered that he would never ask that question.
When Treadway asked why, the resident said that he was afraid the patient might go “crazy” and he wouldn’t know what to do.
“The only way you can make the patient feel safe is to make it clear you’re available and you care,” says Treadway.
According to Abraham C. Verghese, a Stanford professor of medicine who has authored books that stress the importance of bedside exams, the doctor-patient relationship is like a ritual: “one individual comes to another and bares their soul and their body,” he says.
Even with the advances in technology and imaging, Verghese, who was featured on one of Samuels’ radio shows, says he believes that the ritual still needs to be taught.
“We have gotten very good at treating virtual 3D patients and rendering them 2D in a sense as a lot of the activity in hospitals centers around computers,” adds Verghese, who coined the term “iPatient” to describe this trend.
Samuels says he continues to carry around a black bag as a symbol of the doctor who sits by the patient and is able to pull everything he needs out of his bag without the patient worrying about issues like the cost-effectiveness of the procedure or whether the doctor is in “cahoots” with a pharmaceutical company.
“I think the danger in medicine is doctors being captured from within and turning into something else, but the patients can’t tell by looking because they still wear white coats and have stethoscopes around their necks,” says Samuels. “When you go to see the doctor, you expect a person who will basically do anything possible to help you, who will listen to you and care about you—you don’t expect a person looking into a computer screen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and his non-profit organization, known as the Silk Road Project, received the inaugural Thelma E. Goldberg Arts in Education Award yesterday at the culmination of a three-day residency at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
The award—created by Harvard Business School professor Ray A. Goldberg ’48—was given to Ma’s organization for innovation, artistry, and commitment to education.
The Silk Road Project, a non-profit organization founded by Ma in 1988, aims to connect artists across the globe through musical performances, workshops, and educational programs.
In 2005, the Silk Road Project implemented five-year residencies at Harvard and the Rhode Island School of Design to promote musical education and appreciation.
During their stay at the GSE, Ma and the Silk Road Project hosted music workshops, performed with students, and discussed their new Silk Road Connect program.
Silk Road Connect was created to forge a more engaging and interdisciplinary learning experience for middle school students.
In its pilot year, Ma said, Silk Road Connect integrated the historical, scientific, and cultural significance of the indigo plant into the sixth grade curriculum at five New York City middle schools.
Ma also emphasized a “deep parallel” between music and teaching in that both seek to make lasting impressions.
“I try to make something as ephemeral as music memorable to people,” he said. “I want it to live long enough inside of them to inspire action—then my job as a performer is done. I feel that it’s the same with teaching.”
As a part of the Silk Road Project’s residency, the Graduate School of Education also hosted several roundtable discussions with professors, GSE students, and members of Project Zero, a School of Education initiative devoted to the study of the development of learning.
Allison K. Ross, a student in the Arts in Education Program at the GSE, said Ma’s innovative vision of music and education attracted her to the talks.
“As an artist, I was curious how Ma’s artistry led him to be an educator,” she said.
In keeping with the Silk Road residency’s theme of “inspiring passion-driven education,” Ma also led an interactive workshop featuring performances from Harvard College musicians.
The students had little time to rehearse their pieces before the workshop with Ma on Tuesday, but Ma said that spontaneity was part of the workshop experience.
“As Harvard students, they’re virtuosos at cramming,” Ma said, laughing.
He surprised the students by asking them to sing, rather than play, their Mozart piece.
He then encouraged them to maintain the “merry” and ”whimsical” aspects of the piece when they played, moving closely between the musicians on stage and encouraging them to “show off and have fun.”
He also advised the students to keep in mind what motivates them to play music, whether these motivations come from the “head, heart, ear, or the people around them.”
Keir D. Gogwilt ’13, one of the students who participated in the coaching session, found Ma’s approach enlightening.
“As a musician, I’ve been thinking about all of these ideas a lot, and Yo-Yo articulated them perfectly,” Gogwilt said. “It’s great to know that other musicians think about these things as well.”
The Silk Road Project’s residency concluded last night with a concert at Memorial Church, featuring performances from college students, Ma, and the Silk Road Ensemble, as well as a poetry reading from professor Homi K. Bhabha.
“I loved the innovation in all the pieces,” Keith W. Grubb ’13 said.
“They did things you’d almost consider absurd for classical music,” he added. “But once you hear it, you realize it’s actually brilliant.”
Ma said that he hoped that “inspiration” and “passion” were communicated as the central undercurrents informing the Silk Road Project’s residency at the GSE.
“Music involves thinking on every level,” he said. “You must hold in your head a number of different states of mind, you must have the big picture and also be incredibly precise.”
“Things start to sing when you hold these two moments,” he added.
The events at the GSE this week marked the first time the Silk Road Project has held a residency at a Harvard graduate school. Ma’s group has held events at the College for the past four years.
“Through disciplined imagination, and through passion, one makes the leap to developing an empathetic understanding of the world,” Ma said.

Eliot House Master Lino Pertile bestowed a solid silver plate on Quincy House’s women’s intramural rowing team last night in recognition of their victory in the House rowing competition last spring.
The turnover of the so-called Stone Plate, named for its donor—prominent orthopedist Kevin R. Stone ’77—represented the first time in House history that a public trophy has been awarded to a female IM rowing team. The plate is intended to feature the names of victorious rowers from 2008 until 2158.
“I hope women will be more encouraged,” Quincy IM representative Elizabeth C. Balaconis ’10 said. “It’s so impressive to have your name on it for 150 years. Who wouldn’t want that?”
Currently, men’s IM crew teams compete for the Agassiz Cup, which the Eliot team has won for the last three years. To rectify the gender disparity in recognition, Pertile solicited the help of Stone, who led the Eliot men’s crew team as a resident of the house decades ago.
Stone donated the plate, which was fashioned in Boston by a specialist engraver.
“We’ve been trying to photograph this magnificent plate for the last week, but its beauty is so reflective that we couldn’t photograph it,” Pertile said.
Echoing the sentiments of numerous Quincy residents, Quincy House Master Deborah J. Gehrke said that the “100 percent silver, very rare, very heavy” plate was a boon to House pride.
“We’ve never won the Straus Cup, so we were particularly delighted to have a winning sports team,” Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke said.
Though Pertile himself presented the award to Quincy House, he quipped that the turnover was only temporary.
“Make sure that Adams [House] doesn’t take it away from you. We look forward to getting our trophy back next year,” Pertile said.
Pertile wasn’t the only Eliot resident to anticipate the plate’s return to its original owners.
“It’s a trying time for Eliot House. The plate was donated by an Eliot alumnus, and we clearly want to keep the cup in our House as much as possible,” said Rafael T. Quintanar ’10, who was coxswain for the Eliot men’s IM crew team.

Lenny Solomon, singer, songwriter, and lab administrator, will retire this coming December after 38 years as the research program manager for Harvard’s Anderson Research Group.
Officially, Solomon is responsible for the administrative aspects of the research group, which performs experiments dealing with climate change, ozone depletion, and other things “important to the planet.”
But Solomon, who accepted a retirement incentive package offered by the University, plays an even more crucial role in the lab: cheerleader.
“One of the most important things is to keep the staff happy so they’ll stay,” he said. “I’m there to always be an advocate for them.”
Norton T. Allen ’83, a software engineer whom Solomon convinced to join the Anderson Group 26 years ago, said it is Solomon’s friendship that will be missed most in his absence.
“He doesn’t take anything very seriously,” said Allen. “He seems to know everybody, but he makes a point to find out who’s doing something interesting.”
After realizing that people at Harvard might be too focused on their own work to interact with people in other disciplines, Solomon founded the ABCD Committee, an association of working groups compromising Harvard affiliates interested in computers and technology.
“The nature of Harvard is very fragmented,” Allen said. “There’s no organization that could say we represent everybody across the board.”
Through the ABCD Committee network, Solomon met Dennis J. Gurgul, a systems specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, who became the drummer for a band Solomon was trying to form at the time.
Solomon, Gurgul, and two others now comprise the acoustic folk group known as the Lenny Solomon Band. The band has self-produced three CDs and frequently plays gigs in the Boston area.
Five years ago, Solomon, who was frustrated with former President George W. Bush’s proposal to go to Mars, wrote a song entitled “Let’s Go to Mars.” He  recorded it in the basement of the lab and entered it in NeilYoung.com’s “Living With War” song contest. A country parody written from Bush’s perspective, the song was the top-played on the Web site for about a month.
After leaving his position, Solomon plans to continue his music and spend more time with his two Persian cats, two toy poodles, wooden fish, and talking bass.
While both the lab and the committee have not yet decided how to fill his positions, Solomon said he strongly believed all would be well in the end.
“It’s important to have a well-balanced life,” he said of leaving his colleagues. “I have a feeling we’ll still be connected.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High levels of uric acid are typically associated with gout, the painful condition that afflicted King Louis XVIII of France.
But a group of researchers have discovered that high levels of uric acid may actually have a beneficial effect on Parkinson’s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by impairments in motor ability and speech.
“We found that among people with early Parkinson’s disease, those with higher levels of urate showed a slower disease progression over the two-year follow-up period,” said Alberto Ascherio, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and one of the study’s lead researchers.
The present study stemmed from previous epidemiological research finding that members of the general population with high levels of urate were less likely to develop Parkinson’s in later years.
The current study also built upon 2007 findings by the same investigators in which the higher urate levels were first linked to lower rates of clinical decline in a separate group of Parkinson’s patients—a fact that offered valuable corroboration.
“In the context of the clinical setting, seeing the same robust association a second time in an independent population markedly improves its value,” said study author Michael A. Schwarzschild, an associate professor of neurology at the Medical School.
“This link is not just a chance association but truly  is telling us something about Parkinson’s disease.”
He added that the current data cannot resolve whether urate is directly causing the slowing of disease progression or whether there is a third factor affecting both, but the clinical and epidemiological data point “to the value of moving ahead to a clinical trial.”
The researchers are currently recruiting patients for a clinical trial to see if they can safely elevate urate levels.
But Schwarzschild added that their positive results should not overshadow the fact that high levels of uric acid can produce negative outcomes, including gout, kidney stones, and possibly cardiovascular disease.
According to Ascherio, researchers hope that by safely raising levels of urate they can reduce the rate of complications and disease progression in Parkinson’s patients.
“That is the most important step—translating this into something useful,” said Ascherio.

A popular minimally invasive prostate cancer procedure increases a patient’s risk for erectile dysfunction and incontinence, Harvard researchers reported last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Led by Jim C. Hu, genitourinary surgeon at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the study assessed the long-term outcomes of radical prostatectomy, the procedure used to completely remove the prostate gland.
Using Medicare data for nearly 9,000 patients, Hu compared the number of claims filed for complications resulting from the decade-old minimally invasive form of radical prostatectomy with claims following the older, traditional form of the surgery.
Based on the claims, he observed a higher rate of erectile dysfunction and incontinence among those who had undergone the minimally invasive procedure.
But Hu, who is one of the largest providers of minimally invasive surgeries in Boston, attributes much of the difference to surgeon skill levels.
According to Hu, advertising campaigns have increased the patient demand for the minimally invasive surgery and have encouraged less skilled surgeons to perform them.
While the FDA only requires a two-day certification course for a robotic surgery license, Hu said the surgery is difficult to master.
“The learning curve for doing one well is easily several hundred,” he said.
The minimally invasive approach, which involves four to six small incisions and robot assistance, has grown in popularity because of its lower rate of blood transfusion and shorter recovery time.
According to Hu, these surgeries now account for 75 percent of all radical prostatectomies.
While Jerome P. Richie, the chief of urology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said that the study was a good way to compare the two procedures, he critiqued the study’s use of Medicare patients because this limited the population to those over 65 while the median age of those with prostate cancer is in the high 50s.
Hu cautioned that the results of this study should not discourage people from undergoing the less invasive surgery. Instead, he encouraged patients to seek out experienced doctors to perform the procedure.
“Patients need to inquire more of their surgeons,” Richie said. “In expert hands, the difference between open and robotic surgeries is relatively small.”

Thirty new species of plants and fungi were discovered in the Hengduan Mountains of Tibet in a recent research project conducted by Harvard researchers in collaboration with Chinese collectors.
Over the past five years, researcher David E. Boufford and others affiliated with the Harvard University Herbaria—an extensive collection of pressed, dried plant specimens housed at a Divinity Avenue facility—have been working to collect specimens of plant life in the remote mountain range on the Tibetan Plateau.
“If you’re interested in the plants in China, you have to go the mountains,” he said. “Because most of the vegetation in the lowlands was lost as land was converted to agriculture.”
The region has been designated by the nonprofit organization Conservation International as one of the 34 “hotspots” of biodiversity in the world. According to Boufford, these hotspots only occupy 2.5 percent of the globe’s surface yet account for 35 to 40 percent of the variety in the world’s plant species.
The project’s manager Susan Kelley, an executive assistant associated with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, expressed that in terms of plant life, the mountain range is probably the richest part of the North Temperate Zone, which includes North America, Europe, and northern Asia. For example, more than 220 species of “Pedicularis,” a genus of flowering plants, have been found in the area—about 10 times more than in all of North America.
“To see such diversity at that elevation is really unusual,” she said.
Kelley was also involved in creating an online gazetteer that helps researchers to locate places in the region—sorting out the confusion that can arise from the propagation of a variety of transliterated names. The site also makes accessible a database of specimen images and descriptions.
“As provincial and county boundaries have changed, names [of places] have changed,” she said. “The gazetteer was intended not only for our project...[but also other] geologists who have explored that area.”
Field work was a very important component of the species-finding project, as much of the initial processing was done on-site. Boufford, who has done several stints in Tibet, said conducting research in the field is very different than working in a laboratory.
“To see these things in nature, you get a better idea of the diversity and variation,” he said. “You see where [the plants] grow, their interactions with insects and other animals.”
Boufford has been at the Harvard Herbaria for over 28 years and continues to work on other flora projects, including some in Japan, Korea and North America. He said that Harvard’s facility has one of the best collections for studying Asian plants in the world.
“We also have one of the best libraries in the world for systematic botany studies,” he said. “Some of the collections go back to the late 1700s.”

Determined to establish a direct bus line between Harvard Square and New York City by mid-November, a transportation service company that currently runs bus routes throughout the northeast is still facing one important barrier: the city of Cambridge.
TransportAzumah is facing demands from the Cambridge Licensing Commission that the company apply for a jitney license, required for businesses looking to transfer people into and out of the city, according to company founder Joel Azumah. The license could be quite difficult to obtain, he said.
According to Azumah, the city of Cambridge has previously “chased out” three other bus companies that attempted to establish a line connecting Harvard Square to New York—Greyhound, Entertainment Tours, and Vamoose.
“They’re not going to give you any license in Cambridge,” said Frank Curreri, the founder of Entertainment Tours.
Azumah said he believes that the jitney license required by the city is not necessary for carriers with routes that cross state lines, such as TransportAzumah.
“They seem hell-bent on enforcing a licensing process that isn’t legal,” Azumah said.
But Cambridge License Commission chairman Richard V. Scali said that Azumah was mistaken.
“In order to have a fixed route from Point A to Point B, go into the City of Cambridge, and charge a fee, you need a jitney license,” said Scali. Curreri said that Entertainment Tours had a bus license from the state, but received a desist order from the city of Cambridge.
“You know how it is in the People’s Republic of Cambridge,” Curreri said. “They rule.”
He said that a Harvard Law School student attempted to defend the company’s right to operate in Cambridge, but was unsuccessful.
Azumah acknowledged that the city had received complaints about traffic congestion and early morning noise caused by the buses used by previous companies. But he said he did not consider the complaints sufficient to prevent a Cambridge-to-New York bus route from operating.
Despite the complaints, Curreri said that Entertainment Tours’ Cambridge-to-New York line, prior to the city’s desist order, had been popular among students and would run six buses a day during peak times.
Azumah said he hopes to have his line up and running by November, license or not. “We are waiting on them to come to the understanding that I’m right so that we don’t have to have a confrontation.”

The College Events Board held its third Dinner and a Movie Night last night, bringing students out of dining halls and their rooms and into the Square.
This semester’s event included day-long discounts at eight restaurants in Harvard Square and a free 8 p.m. showing of “Where the Wild Things Are” at the AMC Loews Harvard Square Theater­.
Undergraduates had claimed all 520 of the free movie tickets by yesterday afternoon, according to CEB Chair Kevin M. Mee ’10, who said he expected a packed theater.
“People are really taking advantage of these discounts, which we like to hear,” he said before the movie. “We’re excited for a great showing tonight.”
Mee said fewer restaurants signed on to the event this year because of the economic climate, but several participating restaurant managers said they were excited to be part of the promotion.
Dinner and a Movie Night increased business by 30 to 40 percent at The Upper Crust Pizzeria when it took place last year, according to manager Shawn C. Shenefield. While graduate students are the restaurant’s most common customers, Shenefield said that Dinner and a Movie Night brings out a larger than average number of students from the College.
Divya V. Raghavan ’11 was one of those students. She said that while she had never been to Upper Crust before, the 15-percent discount and her friends’ cravings made the difference yesterday.
While Warren S. Loegering ’12 said that a buy-one, get-one-free discount motivated him to make a pre-movie stop at Qdoba, supervisor Samuel Solis said that Dinner and a Movie Night, while increasing traffic, did not have a huge impact on Qdoba’s business.
“A little bit more than usual, but not too much,” Solis said of the number of customers.
Finale Desserterie & Bakery had not seen an increase in sales as of 6:45 p.m. last night, according to general manager Tom J. Whalen, but he said he had not given up hope for the evening.
“We’re a dessert place,” he said. “We expect more to come after the movie.”

A group of researchers in the lab of chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber have found a way to synthesize two- and three-dimensional versions of the microscopic strands known as nanowires—a breakthrough that researchers say may greatly increase the reach and applicability of the field by allowing scientists to design vastly more complex structures.
The discovery may prove useful in areas ranging from photovoltaics to recording voltages inside and outside cells, according to the study’s lead author Bozhi Tian, a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology. Colleagues in the department yesterday acknowledged the significance of the research.
“One of the big problems in the nanotube community is how you take all these different Lego building blocks of nanoscience and put them together into more complex sort of structures,” said Thomas J. Kempa, a chemistry graduate student and author. “Any segment or element which allows you to break free from the one-dimensional space and move in another direction is key.”
Tian’s method hinges on the introduction of bends known as “kinks” into the previously linear structure of the nanowire. He told The Crimson this week that his discovery was inspired by what he saw in nature—both the “kinks” in organic molecules that give them specific geometries and the crystalline structure of many minerals.
“In my work, I designed this kinked nanowire molecule by inserting joints into a straight backbone,” Tian said. “The segments and joints are quite similar to the chemical bonds and atoms in an organic molecule, although our material is almost four orders of magnitude larger in size.”
Tian added that he has been able to introduce kinks at angles of 120 degrees and 109.5 degrees, which correspond to the bond angles in two common molecular geometries.
“The amazing thing about the bent nanowires is the ability to control the direction that the nanowire is going at any particular time,” said David C. Bell, one of the authors and the manager of the imaging and analysis facility at the Center for Nanoscale Systems, referencing the discovery’s electrical application. “If you can control the direction of the nanowires, in theory you can build any sort of circuit you want.”
Aside from their potential use as a means of conducting electricity, the nanowires may serve to localize functionality at a particular point within the nanostructure, said Ping Xie, a postdoctoral fellow and author. With one-dimensional nanowires, it is currently difficult to determine where activity is concentrated within the linear wire.
According to Kempa, the researchers noticed while performing previous experiments that under some conditions their one-dimensional nanowires would kink.
“We said, ‘Hmm, that’s kind of interesting,’” said Kempa. “Bozhi took it a step further and found a way to controllably induce these kinks exactly where we want them during the nanowire synthesis.”

Speaking at the Harvard Kennedy School as part of the University’s Public Service Week, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 said yesterday that it is precisely the personal commitment to public service that has mattered most in his administration.
While acknowledging the bureaucratic nature of his job, Patrick stressed the importance of service especially in a time of crisis. “Even in the bleakest of times, people are full of hope,” he said, challenging the audience to serve the public in whatever way they could.
Speaking of his time as a first-term governor, Patrick said he was proud of many achievements, including three balanced budgets and an expansion of low-income public housing. But he did add that his state and country were still in economic crisis, despite quick action from the federal government. “We don’t seem to appreciate how close we were to a depression,” said the governor.
The speech came amidst a week of service-geared events launched by the University, including public sector career fairs and seminars, service days, and food drives. The University has also agreed to provide resources for a year of weekly volunteer support at the Greater Boston Food Bank—the first University-wide commitment of its kind. The aim of this week, wrote President Drew G. Faust in a letter to the Harvard community on Monday, is “to reinforce Harvard’s commitment to serve the common good.”
Patrick cited a similar commitment, looking back to his undergraduate experience with the Phillips Brooks House Association and his post-graduation work in Darfur. “In order to serve effectively, our work was very personal,” he said of his experiences. “You had to understand the policy framework, but you had to get out of that framework to see where policy touches people.”
Before the event, Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 praised Patrick’s “compelling personal story” of rising from difficult economic circumstances in Chicago to a long and prosperous career in both the public and private sectors. Ellwood said that Patrick’s speech complemented the Kennedy School’s mission of training public leaders to solve problems. “We think the governor will do an excellent job of inspiring people to run for public office as one form of public service,” Ellwood said.
Jordan E. Sessler ’13 said Patrick’s message had “great wisdom and energy,” adding that “it was especially valuable to know there are many ways for people to serve their communities.” Patrick encouraged the audience to have the courage to transcend their own interests by taking action in the realm of public service.
“Now more than ever, we need you and your sense of responsibility for one another to lead us into the future,” he said. “We need you to articulate what the world should look like, and then work with us—all of us together—to make it so.”

The Harvard football team’s practices this week had the feel of uncharted waters.
Coming off its worst loss in three years—a rather shocking 35-18 home defeat at the hands of the Patriot League’s Lafayette College, the Crimson (3-2, 2-0 Ivy) looks to rebound tomorrow at 12:00 p.m. as it takes on Ivy League rival Princeton (1-4, 0-2 Ivy) at Harvard Stadium.
The Crimson hadn’t lost a game by more than a touchdown since a 34-13 defeat at Yale on Nov. 18, 2006. But the players aren’t hanging their heads.
“Last Saturday is going to end up being a good thing for the team,” said captain and defensive lineman Carl Ehrlich. “We got hung up a little bit. It made us refocus on the basics and playing disciplined football.”
The team isn’t doing anything largely different this week as it prepares for the Tigers, which it beat, 24-20, in New Jersey last season. For the first time in 10 years, Princeton has lost its first two league contests.
“Despite their record, they’re a very good team,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “You can look at the way they played Colgate in that Thursday-night game earlier this month. We’re solid...but we need to improve in all areas to have a successful game this week.”
To win, the Crimson will have to improve its run defense, which gave up 133 yards in the loss to Lafayette. This will be no easy task, as Princeton comes in averaging nearly 120 rushing yards per game, good for third in the Ancient Eight.
In last season’s matchup, then-junior running back Jordan Culbreath ran for 154 yards against the Harvard defense.
“I can’t remember a game which we won where we came out more disappointed in our performance,” Ehrlich said of last year’s matchup. “Our defense still has a pretty bad taste [in its mouth].”
However, Culbreath is out for the year as he deals with health issues. This has forced freshman running back Akil Sharp and converted defensive back Meko McCray to carry the majority of the rushing load for the Tigers.
The duo has combined to average 4.7 yards per carry since Culbreath went down.
“It’s been a learning process,” Princeton coach Roger Hughes said. “I’m very pleased with the way Meko’s been improving this week, but if we’re going to win, we need them to step up.”
It’s not just the Princeton running backs that will need to elevate their game.
Last week, senior linebacker Scott Britton suffered a season-ending knee injury in a loss against Brown. Britton had ranked 10th nationally with 11.2 tackles per game and was coming off an Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week award when he went down.
“He provided a lot of energy on the team,” Hughes said about the impact of Britton’s loss. “It’d be naive to think you wouldn’t lose something.”
Britton’s injury will put even more pressure on Tigers’ junior linebacker Steven Cody, who leads the Ivy League and ranks third in the nation with 13.3 tackles per game. Murphy calls him one of “the best professional prospect[s] in our conference.”
To neutralize Cody and the rest of the Princeton defense, the Crimson will need to improve its own rushing attack. Last week, Harvard managed only 74 rushing yards on 34 attempts, a measly 2.2 yards per carry.
In terms of the passing game, junior quarterback Collier Winters will look to build on a strong fourth quarter against Lafayette, in which he threw two touchdown passes.
“We’ve got to get pressure on the QB, that’s a defensive back’s best friend,” Hughes said. “The only way to shut [Winters] down is to make sure the ball doesn’t come out.”
In the early part of the season, Winters has developed a rapport with junior wide receiver Chris Lorditch, who had his second-career 100-yard receiving game last week.
Defensively, the Crimson will look to shut down junior Princeton quarterback Tommy Wornham, who has developed into a double threat, with 788 passing yards and 224 rushing yards—good for first on the team.
“They’ve got a lot of speed,” Murphy said. “I’ve got to believe that they’re at least in the upper half of the Ivy League in terms of talent.”
Coming off a tough loss, Harvard should receive an extra adrenaline boost from playing a key rival on Homecoming Weekend.
With the exception of a 2007 Crimson 17-point victory, games between the two teams at Harvard Stadium have been historically close.
In fact, of the five games between 1997 and 2005, four were decided by a field goal or less, the other by a touchdown.
“Princeton’s a game our kids always get excited about,” Murphy said.  “From an emotional standpoint, it’s a good game to play right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the last few weeks, teams across the Ivy League have been served hearty portions of humble pie. Not enough, mind you, for regurgitation of the preseason accolades rained down upon the League and its players, but sufficient to make you feel queasy about their postseason prospects. With roughly a month left until the postseason and the Ivy campaign half finished, now is a good time to assess the fortunes (and misfortunes) of the Ancient Eight.
REACHING FOR THE TUMS
Princeton’s young guns played with tremendous swagger earlier in the year, quickly jumping out to a 4-0 record. Starting with their first nationally ranked opponent (No. 19 Monmouth), the team proceeded to lose five of its next six games—including defeats to Dartmouth and Brown. Although the Tigers are on a two-game winning streak, their midseason slump has all but eliminated them from the Ivy-title race. Rookie forward Matt Sanner is one to watch, though. With three goals and three assists thus far, the newcomer has emerged as one of the top contenders for Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
Penn, the co-defending Ivy champs, expected to face a difficult season after losing a strong senior class. I’m guessing, though, that it didn’t expect to be winless in its first three games. Nor could it have foreseen only getting a draw, at home, against a team that finished 1-15 last year (Here’s to you, Cornell). Midfielders Alex Takakuwa and Christian Barreiro have done well to score six goals apiece, but the defense has leaked in more goals (22) than any other team in the conference.
MILK WAS A BAD CHOICE
Dartmouth and Harvard, preseason favorites to contend for the Ivy title, loaded up their non-conference slate with games against ranked opponents. With both teams ranked in the top ten earlier this season (The Big Green were ranked as high as #5; the Crimson #6) and boasting prolific strikers like Daniel Keat, Lucky Mkosana (Dartmoth) and senior Andre Akpan (Harvard), their decisions seemed justified.
Or not. Three times Dartmouth has faced off against ranked opponents; three times they’ve walked away without a win. Suffice it to say, the Big Green is no longer ranked in the top ten.
Riding high on its own top ten status, the Crimson was brought down to Earth with a 1-0 loss at Wake Forest. Harvard followed up that loss with a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of then-No.17 Connecticut.
To be fair, the Huskies have feasted on all their opponents as of late; the team hasn’t allowed a goal in eight games, outscoring its opposition 16-0 during that span. Still, when you’re ranked sixth nationally, have a player contending for the Hermann trophy, and boast a goalkeeper with a sub-1.00 GAA, you shouldn’t be losing by four goals to any team.
Both Ivy teams have played well in-conference (Dartmouth is 3-0-0, Harvard 2-0-1), and the Ivy League has shown its ability to advance teams past the first round of the NCAA tournament. But the conference will need to demonstrate its capacity to consistently beat nationally ranked teams if it hopes to continue garnering national respect.
So, who wants dessert?
Princeton and Penn’s woes have effectively turned the Ivy championship into a three-horse race. Dartmouth, Harvard, and Brown (2-0-0) have all shown they are capable of winning the league, so the title will largely come down to how the teams fare against each other. Dartmouth still has to contend with away fixtures in Providence and Cambridge. Brown has already lost to Harvard and faces a difficult game this weekend against a resurgent Cornell squad.
The Crimson may be in the best position of the triumvirate. It has already topped Brown and hosts three of its last four Ivy games. Given the tight competition, however, Harvard has left itself with little room for error with its draw against the Big Red. The next two weeks against Princeton and Dartmouth may well wrap up the title for the Crimson if they obtain the maximum six points.
Regardless of who wins the Ivy crown it appears likely that all three teams, barring monumental collapse, will make the NCAA tournament. No. 11 Harvard, No. 15 Dartmouth, and No. 18 Brown have all played difficult non-conference schedules and the tournament committee will look favorably upon the teams’ overall records (All three have a winning percentage above .700).
Let’s pop some bottles
Along with guiding their team to a 10-2-1 record thus far, several Crimson players have placed themselves into the discussion for postseason honors. Defenders Kwaku Nyamekye and Baba Omosegbon, along with goalkeeper Austin Harms, have led the Harvard backline to a league-leading 0.67 GAA. All three should receive serious considerations for All-Ivy first team honors.
Rookies Brian Rogers and Scott Prozeller have also made valuable contributions to the team, combining for six goals and six assists. Rogers in particular should be considered the front runner for Ivy Rookie of the Year, although he will be challenged by Princeton’s Sanner and Dartmouth keeper Sean Donovan (10 starts, 1.16 GAA).
Akpan, the pre-season favorite for Ivy Player of the Year and legitimate contender for the Hermann trophy, has put in an impressive season thus far but will need to keep producing (and more importantly, keep winning) to secure any trophies. On the Ivy front, Dartmouth’s Keat (7 goals, 5 assists) looks to be Akpan’s chief competitor. The success of their teams will play a large factor in determining who wins this year.
On the national level, Akpan’s points-per-game average of 1.75 is amongst the highest in Division I but he will likely have to lead Harvard far into the NCAA tournament if he hopes to be the league’s first Hermann trophy winner since 1984.
Akpan will face stiff competition, though, particularly from members of top-ranked University of Akron. Sophomore forward Teal Banbury (11 goals, 3 assists) has led an attack that has outscored its opponents by 41 goals. Freshman keeper David Meves has largely contributed to that +/- margin, allowing three goals in 14 games for an outstanding GAA of 0.22.  Despite being underclassmen, the success of their team has elevated both competitors to the forefront of the Hermann trophy discussion. Akpan will need to continue raining goals on his opposition to merit consideration.
Overall, the League has experienced a few hiccups and minor bouts of indigestion, but the focus on Ivy action from here on out will allow teams to forget about past results. Success for teams across the League will be inextricably linked with the form of their top players. Only the crème de la crème will taste the sweetness of victory.

Yesterday morning, as I furiously typed away at a Spanish 50 composition that blatantly ripped off the plot of “Election”—the great Tom Perrotta high school novel and Reese Witherspoon’s career-launching movie—I thought to myself, “Has the recent era of great Ivy League running backs come to an end?”
The era can be traced back to 2003. That season, three Ivy League rushers ran for more than 1,000 yards. They included Brown’s Nick Hartigan and Harvard’s Clifton Dawson ’07, a duo that must be mentioned in any discussion of the conference’s all-time great tailbacks.
Hartigan turned in three ridiculous years for the Bears—including his 2005 campaign, in which he ran for 1,727 yards, which remains the second highest single-season total in Ancient Eight history.
In Dawson’s senior season, he singlehandedly rewrote the Ivy League record book, taking the career rushing record from Cornell legend Ed Marinaro and finishing with 60 rushing touchdowns.
After Dawson’s graduation, Yale’s Mike McLeod destroyed everything in his path (except Harvard) in 2007. The Bulldog ran for 1,617 yards and scored an absurd 23 touchdowns—just one shy of Marinaro’s single-season mark.
McLeod had a subpar senior season in 2008. Princeton’s Jordan Culbreath had him covered. He rushed for 1,139 yards and averaged 5.8 yards per carry.
But at the midway point of this season, it appears that the pantheon of great Ivy League running backs is full. Culbreath, who many assumed would run away with the league’s Player of the Year award, was diagnosed with anemia and has since played sparingly.
Columbia’s Ray Rangel has made the most of his limited touches, running for 420 yards on 72 carries. But you can’t really be considered a great back if you’re not the focal point of your offense.
And while Harvard has the best running game in town, averaging 153.4 yards per game, its success traces not to one latter day Marinaro, but to a trio.
Yes, I said trio. Junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales have been good and deserve to continue taking the majority of the carries, but it’s a shame that senior Cheng Ho remains marginalized. Is he as athletic as the other two? No. But the guy has averaged five yards a carry in his career, and when Harvard had to start him against Lehigh in Week 3, he ran for 132 yards on only 21 touches. I’m just saying.
The league doesn’t feel right without a dominant back, and I’m keeping a vigil that the next Dawson or Hartigan breaks free for a 200-yard game this week. I’ll feel better, and my Spanish teacher will save some red ink.
BROWN (3-2, 1-1 IVY) AT CORNELL (2-3, 1-1 IVY)
The Ivy League might lack a dominant running back, but it sure as hell has a dominant wideout: Brown’s Buddy Farnham. He used to form a receiving duo with Bobby Sewall known as the “Killer B’s,”  but now—like Prince—he’s flourishing as a solo act.
Farnham hauled in 10 catches last week against Princeton for 199 yards (199!). Maybe now he’s going to become the runaway Ivy League Player of the Year we expected.
Prediction: Brown 31, Cornell 24.
COLUMBIA (2-3, 1-1 IVY) AT DARTMOUTH (0-5, 0-2 IVY)
Time to jump off the Columbia bandwagon. My sleeper pick for Ivy League champion is just plain sleeping. The Lions’ long road back from their winless Ivy slate in ’07 brought them to the neighborhood of contending. But well-armed Penn was on the neighborhood watch and banished Columbia, 27-13.
Luckily for the Lions this week, they get Dartmouth.
Prediction: Columbia 38, Dartmouth 10.
YALE (3-2, 1-1 IVY) AT PENN (3-2, 2-0 IVY)
Nothing is set in stone, but it looks like the Ivy title will come down to Harvard and Penn. The Quakers have finally made me a believer.
Al Bagnoli’s squad has not played a stinker this season (the losses were both close, to No. 2 Villanova and a Lafayette team that left its tire tracks all over Harvard), and that shouldn’t change against milquetoast Yale.
Prediction: Penn 24, Yale 17
PRINCETON (1-4, 0-2 IVY) AT HARVARD (3-2, 2-0 IVY)
After that steamrolling by Lafayette, Crimson coach Tim Murphy reiterated that Harvard, despite its unbeaten Ivy start, hasn’t become dominant and needs all components to function smoothly.
Junior quarterback Collier Winters and his receivers must reestablish a rhythm; Gordon, Scales and the offensive line must resume netting positive yardage; the defense must remain resolute for four quarters. Princeton will provide the Saturday at the tune-up shop the Crimson needs.
Prediction: Harvard 27, Princeton 13
Last Week: 4-2
Record to Date: 20-12

FlyBy has never liked ladybugs.  Those sickening little spots.  Those creepy little legs.  Oh, sure, some people think they’re cute.  And we’ll concede that their penchant for munching on aphids is a useful one.  But can you imagine a huge mass of ladybugs swarming all over your windows, trying to burrow in through the cracks as you stare in horror?
Well, watch out, dear FlyBy reader.  They’ve already hit Pfoho—your House could be next.
Find the details (including survival tips) after the jump.
Okay, okay, so we’re being a little overdramatic.  Still, ladybugs have been a very real problem at Pfoho.  Two days ago, Benjamin Rahn, a Pfoho tutor, wrote this message in an email sent over the House list:
“This afternoon I noticed some small groups of ladybugs around the windows of our suite—I then went outside to discover that they've taken quite a liking to the outside wall of Moors facing the quad, and so some must have decided to explore inside our slightly-open windows.  Folks living in Holmes and Wolbach have reported the same.”
In another thread, several other Pfoho residents complained about the ladybugs, musing that the pests are probably coming inside to escape the cold.  Rose Yan ’10 told FlyBy that she hasn’t seen any more ladybugs in her room recently, which could be due to the warmer weather today.
The overall number of ladybugs, thankfully, hasn’t been high—Rahn said he has seen only five to ten by each window.  “Had there been 100s it might have been very disturbing,” he added, “but in small groups they're interesting to watch.”
Erin R. Carey ’01, another Pfoho tutor, explained that these bugs are in fact probably not your garden-variety ladybugs.  Instead, they are most likely a particular kind of ladybug called Asian lady beetles, which are “an invasive species” and therefore the “more problematic insect.”  These pests are apparently a common nuisance in the fall, but neither Carey nor anyone else FlyBy talked to said they remembered ever seeing them at Pfoho before.
Should you find yourself the victim of a ladybug invasion (which will be more likely if your room faces south), here are some ways to deal: Keeping your windows closed is an easy and obvious first step.  You can also leave your lamp on, which will attract and trap the little pests.  If there are just too many, whip out the vacuum cleaner and clean those suckers up.

DAPA's on a roll. Just a couple of weeks ago Harvard’s Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors brought us their memorable, if hallucinatory, PSA on avoiding stress-related drinkage, and this weekend they’re continuing their "Kill The Hangover" campaign by offering some sweet deals at b.good:
Both tonight and tomorrow, Harvard ID holders can get a 2-for-1 deal on sliders between 11pm and 1am. And from 1am to 2am? FREE. SLIDERS.
DAPA’s aim in crafting the event was to “provide a late-night option that wasn't unhealthy and didn't provide an Animal House-type atmosphere where being wasted is the norm,” says Yale A. Zeller '10, chair of DAPA's Community Education and Outreach subcommittee. So non-drinkers get to hang out in a chill environment, and drinkers can sober up by cutting themselves off and also by chowing down, slowing their bodies’ alcohol absorption. More heads up on the deal after the jump. With 150-ish facebook event RSVP's, students should expect a crowd. Barring a Lamont/Felipe’s-style riot, though, DAPA and b.good are looking to continue their newfound partnership. "Every couple weeks we are planning on doing some great late-night or pre-drinking-time deals at b.good,” says Zeller. “Future deals won't be quite as extravagant, but they will be a lot of fun and hopefully get a lot of people to make safer drinking choices.”
Sounds excellent. FlyBy’s going to sign off now so we can get a head start on lassoing us a cheetah* cuz we cannot wait for those delicious, delicious burgers tonight. OM NOM NOM NOM.

President Barack Obama flew into Logan airport, visited a bunch of famous MIT professors, and pushed for the passage of his energy and climiate bill at MIT this morning. Oh, and he dissed Harvard, much to FlyBy's chagrin.
If the POTUS came to the most prestigious school in all of Cambridge instead, we would have shown  him a good time -- and probably wouldn't have handed him a copy of the periodic table the size of a business card. Plus, Al Gore's visit last year is testament to the fact that Green is the new Crimson.
FlyBy's huffiness at being passed over for the second best school in Cambridge, Mass. aside, Obama gave a fantastically crisp 15-minute speech on the importance of clean energy. He also called out the fools who don't believe in clean energy and the "folks" who have been lobbying against the energy and climate bill. And then he left. Off to something important like Deval Patrick's fundraiser. Too bad his motorcade wasn't actually displaced to the top of Building 10 so we could have him around longer.
Notables spotted at the event. Senator John Kerry shaking hands in the front row, Congressman Michael Capuano handing out business cards, and Cambridge Mayor Denise Simmons striding into Kresge Auditorium with a gaggle of city councilmen.
Check out Monday's Crimson for full coverage  of the event.
Full text of the speech after the jump.
Thank you very much. Please, have a seat. Thank you. Thank you, MIT. (Applause.) I am -- I am hugely honored to be here. It's always been a dream of mine to visit the most prestigious school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. (Applause.) Hold on a second -- certainly the most prestigious school in this part of Cambridge, Massachusetts. (Laughter.) And I'll probably be here for a while -- I understand a bunch of engineering students put my motorcade on top of Building 10. (Laughter.) 
This tells you something about MIT -- everybody hands out periodic tables. (Laughter.) What's up with that? (Laughter.)
I want I want to thank all of you for the warm welcome and for the work all of you are doing to generate and test new ideas that hold so much promise for our economy and for our lives. And in particular, I want to thank two outstanding MIT professors, Eric Lander, a person you just heard from, Ernie Moniz, for their service on my council of advisors on science and technology. And they have been hugely helpful to us already on looking at, for example, how the federal government can most effectively respond to the threat of the H1N1 virus. So I'm very grateful to them.
We've got some other special guests here I just want to acknowledge very briefly. First of all, my great friend and a champion of science and technology here in the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts, my friend Deval Patrick is here. (Applause.) Our Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray is here. (Applause.) Attorney General Martha Coakley is here. (Applause.) Auditor of the Commonwealth, Joe DeNucci is here. (Applause.) The Mayor of the great City of Cambridge, Denise Simmons is in the house. (Applause.) The Mayor of Boston, Tom Menino, is not here, but he met me at the airport and he is doing great; he sends best wishes.
Somebody who really has been an all-star in Capitol Hill over the last 20 years, but certainly over the last year, on a whole range of issues -- everything from Afghanistan to clean energy -- a great friend, John Kerry. Please give John Kerry a round of applause. (Applause.)
And a wonderful member of Congress -- I believe this is your district, is that correct, Mike? Mike Capuano. Please give Mike a big round of applause. (Applause.)
Now, Dr. Moniz is also the Director of MIT's Energy Initiative, called MITEI. And he and President Hockfield just showed me some of the extraordinary energy research being conducted at this institute: windows that generate electricity by directing light to solar cells; light-weight, high-power batteries that aren't built, but are grown -- that was neat stuff; engineering viruses to create -- to create batteries; more efficient lighting systems that rely on nanotechnology; innovative engineering that will make it possible for offshore wind power plants to deliver electricity even when the air is still.
And it's a reminder that all of you are heirs to a legacy of innovation -- not just here but across America -- that has improved our health and our wellbeing and helped us achieve unparalleled prosperity. I was telling John and Deval on the ride over here, you just get excited being here and seeing these extraordinary young people and the extraordinary leadership of Professor Hockfield because it taps into something essential about America -- it's the legacy of daring men and women who put their talents and their efforts into the pursuit of discovery. And it's the legacy of a nation that supported those intrepid few willing to take risks on an idea that might fail -- but might also change the world.
Even in the darkest of times this nation has seen, it has always sought a brighter horizon. Think about it. In the middle of the Civil War, President Lincoln designated a system of land grant colleges, including MIT, which helped open the doors of higher education to millions of people. A year -- a full year before the end of World War II, President Roosevelt signed the GI Bill which helped unleash a wave of strong and broadly shared economic growth. And after the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth, the United States went about winning the Space Race by investing in science and technology, leading not only to small steps on the moon but also to tremendous economic benefits here on Earth.
So the truth is, we have always been about innovation, we have always been about discovery. That's in our DNA. The truth is we also face more complex challenges than generations past. A medical system that holds the promise of unlocking new cures is attached to a health care system that has the potential to bankrupt families and businesses and our government. A global marketplace that links the trader on Wall Street to the homeowner on Main Street to the factory worker in China -- an economy in which we all share opportunity is also an economy in which we all share crisis. We face threats to our security that seek -- there are threats to our security that are based on those who would seek to exploit the very interconnectedness and openness that's so essential to our prosperity. The system of energy that powers our economy also undermines our security and endangers our planet.
Now, while the challenges today are different, we have to draw on the same spirit of innovation that's always been central to our success. And that's especially true when it comes to energy. There may be plenty of room for debate as to how we transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels -- we all understand there's no silver bullet to do it. There's going to be a lot of debate about how we move from an economy that's importing oil to one that's exporting clean energy technology; how we harness the innovative potential on display here at MIT to create millions of new jobs; and how we will lead the world to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. There are going to be all sorts of debates, both in the laboratory and on Capitol Hill. But there's no question that we must do all these things.
Countries on every corner of this Earth now recognize that energy supplies are growing scarcer, energy demands are growing larger, and rising energy use imperils the planet we will leave to future generations. And that's why the world is now engaged in a peaceful competition to determine the technologies that will power the 21st century. From China to India, from Japan to Germany, nations everywhere are racing to develop new ways to producing and use energy. The nation that wins this competition will be the nation that leads the global economy. I am convinced of that. And I want America to be that nation. It's that simple. (Applause.)
That's why the Recovery Act that we passed back in January makes the largest investment in clean energy in history, not just to help end this recession, but to lay a new foundation for lasting prosperity. The Recovery Act includes $80 billion to put tens of thousands of Americans to work developing new battery technologies for hybrid vehicles; modernizing the electric grid; making our homes and businesses more energy efficient; doubling our capacity to generate renewable electricity. These are creating private-sector jobs weatherizing homes; manufacturing cars and trucks; upgrading to smart electric meters; installing solar panels; assembling wind turbines; building new facilities and factories and laboratories all across America. And, by the way, helping to finance extraordinary research.
In fact, in just a few weeks, right here in Boston, workers will break ground on a new Wind Technology Testing Center, a project made possible through a $25 million Recovery Act investment as well as through the support of Massachusetts and its partners. And I want everybody to understand -- Governor Patrick's leadership and vision made this happen. He was bragging about Massachusetts on the way over here -- I told him, you don't have to be a booster, I already love the state. (Applause.) But he helped make this happen.
Hundreds of people will be put to work building this new testing facility, but the benefits will extend far beyond these jobs. For the first time, researchers in the United States will be able to test the world's newest and largest wind turbine blades -- blades roughly the length of a football field -- and that in turn will make it possible for American businesses to develop more efficient and effective turbines, and to lead a market estimated at more than $2 trillion over the next two decades.
This grant follows other Recovery Act investments right here in Massachusetts that will help create clean energy jobs in this commonwealth and across the country. And this only builds on the work of your governor, who has endeavored to make Massachusetts a clean energy leader -- from increasing the supply of renewable electricity, to quadrupling solar capacity, to tripling the commonwealth's investment in energy efficiency, all of which helps to draw new jobs and new industries. (Applause.) That's worth applause.
Now, even as we're investing in technologies that exist today, we're also investing in the science that will produce the technologies of tomorrow. The Recovery Act provides the largest single boost in scientific research in history. Let me repeat that: The Recovery Act, the stimulus bill represents the largest single boost in scientific research in history. (Applause.) An increase -- that's an increase in funding that's already making a difference right here on this campus. And my budget also makes the research and experimentation tax credit permanent -- a tax credit that spurs innovation and jobs, adding $2 to the economy for every dollar that it costs.
And all of this must culminate in the passage of comprehensive legislation that will finally make renewable energy the profitable kind of energy in America. John Kerry is working on this legislation right now, and he's doing a terrific job reaching out across the other side of the aisle because this should not be a partisan issue. Everybody in America should have a stake -- (applause) -- everybody in America should have a stake in legislation that can transform our energy system into one that's far more efficient, far cleaner, and provide energy independence for America -- making the best use of resources we have in abundance, everything from figuring out how to use the fossil fuels that inevitably we are going to be using for several decades, things like coal and oil and natural gas; figuring out how we use those as cleanly and efficiently as possible; creating safe nuclear power; sustainable -- sustainably grown biofuels; and then the energy that we can harness from wind and the waves and the sun. It is a transformation that will be made as swiftly and as carefully as possible, to ensure that we are doing what it takes to grow this economy in the short, medium, and long term. And I do believe that a consensus is growing to achieve exactly that.
The Pentagon has declared our dependence on fossil fuels a security threat. Veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are traveling the country as part of Operation Free, campaigning to end our dependence on oil -- (applause) -- we have a few of these folks here today, right there. (Applause.) The young people of this country -- that I've met all across America -- they understand that this is the challenge of their generation.
Leaders in the business community are standing with leaders in the environmental community to protect the economy and the planet we leave for our children. The House of Representatives has already passed historic legislation, due in large part to the efforts of Massachusetts' own Ed Markey, he deserves a big round of applause. (Applause.) We're now seeing prominent Republicans like Senator Lindsey Graham joining forces with long-time leaders John Kerry on this issue, to swiftly pass a bill through the Senate as well. In fact, the Energy Committee, thanks to the work of its Chair, Senator Jeff Bingaman, has already passed key provisions of comprehensive legislation.
So we are seeing a convergence. The naysayers, the folks who would pretend that this is not an issue, they are being marginalized. But I think it's important to understand that the closer we get, the harder the opposition will fight and the more we'll hear from those whose interest or ideology run counter to the much needed action that we're engaged in. There are those who will suggest that moving toward clean energy will destroy our economy -- when it's the system we currently have that endangers our prosperity and prevents us from creating millions of new jobs. There are going to be those who cynically claim -- make cynical claims that contradict the overwhelming scientific evidence when it comes to climate change, claims whose only purpose is to defeat or delay the change that we know is necessary.
So we're going to have to work on those folks. But understand there's also another myth that we have to dispel, and this one is far more dangerous because we're all somewhat complicit in it. It's far more dangerous than any attack made by those who wish to stand in the way progress -- and that's the idea that there is nothing or little that we can do. It's pessimism. It's the pessimistic notion that our politics are too broken and our people too unwilling to make hard choices for us to actually deal with this energy issue that we're facing. And implicit in this argument is the sense that somehow we've lost something important -- that fighting American spirit, that willingness to tackle hard challenges, that determination to see those challenges to the end, that we can solve problems, that we can act collectively, that somehow that is something of the past.
I reject that argument. I reject it because of what I've seen here at MIT. Because of what I have seen across America. Because of what we know we are capable of achieving when called upon to achieve it. This is the nation that harnessed electricity and the energy contained in the atom, that developed the steamboat and the modern solar cell. This is the nation that pushed westward and looked skyward. We have always sought out new frontiers and this generation is no different.
Today's frontiers can't be found on a map. They're being explored in our classrooms and our laboratories, in our start-ups and our factories. And today's pioneers are not traveling to some far flung place. These pioneers are all around us -- the entrepreneurs and the inventors, the researchers, the engineers -- helping to lead us into the future, just as they have in the past. This is the nation that has led the world for two centuries in the pursuit of discovery. This is the nation that will lead the clean energy economy of tomorrow, so long as all of us remember what we have achieved in the past and we use that to inspire us to achieve even more in the future.
I am confident that's what's happening right here at this extraordinary institution. And if you will join us in what is sure to be a difficult fight in the months and years ahead, I am confident that all of America is going to be pulling in one direction to make sure that we are the energy leader that we need to be.
Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

Right, right right. It's hard to see what's going on in this picture.  FlyBy only had the old camera phone handy.  Anyway, a word of explanation: Harvard Alumni Association apparently has "Love Story" going in Tercentenary in honor of the University's brand new Homecoming event.  And S'mores.  Nothing like a bad movie and some snacks to swell the pride and usher in the weekend.  Did we mention to the alumni that the University could use some donations? Enjoy the game tomorrow.
