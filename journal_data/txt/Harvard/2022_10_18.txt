Depending on who you ask, high fashion might mean classic Parisian ateliers like Chanel or Bode’s one-of-a-kind bespoke up-cycled pieces. The same focuses pop up: high-quality materials, immaculate tailoring, and of course, hours and hours of handmade craftsmanship that elevates garment-making from a skill to an art form. This work can include intricate patterns of embroidered sequins, layers of fluffy tulle, or even a sleek little black dress; what matters is that it draws on years of human expertise and developed techniques. The spray-on dress at Coperni’s recent Spring/Summer 2023 show poses a new and interesting question: Can the use of technology be considered “craftsmanship” as well?
10 minutes: That’s how long it took for Bella Hadid to go from nude underwear to fully dressed. She strutted down the runway in a dress made on the spot with synthetic fibers sprayed onto her body and swiftly tailored by Coperni’s head of design, Charlotte Raymond, to include a draped neckline and thigh-high slit. It was sleek, chic, and a little sexy. It also defied any notion of traditional dress-making — a bold reimagination of what it means to make a garment.
While Coperni’s founders Meyer and Vaillant insist the showcase is not an homage, it finds its clear visual predecessor in Alexander McQueen’s Spring/Summer 1999. In a flashy display, supermodel Shalom Harlow stood in a white dress on a rotating platform as two robotic arms sprayed her with yellow and black paint. Crucially, this show added nuance to the idea of artistic creation. In a piece technically created by robots, attributing it to Alexander McQueen required viewers to recognize that artistic conception was just as important as the act of making itself. Coperni’s latest show builds on this heritage — in a sprayed-on dress there is no need for stitching or weaving textiles, the inventiveness of the idea is part of its genius. Even as Charlotte Raymond altered it on stage, all eyes were on the futuristic fabric molding itself to the body rather than the tailoring.
Moreover, Coperni’s dress also brings up an interesting perspective on the materials fashion can make use of. The liquid sprayed onto Bella Hadid is composed of short natural fibers bound together with natural and synthetic polymers and then mixed with liquid solvents, an invention of Fabrican, the British company behind the technology. The material is a plant-based alternative, reflecting a recent push in the fashion industry, where designers utilize technology to find sustainable solutions to fashion’s longstanding problems with environmental pollution. For example, up-and-coming fashion designers like Grace Ling use technology to approach sustainability in a less obvious but equally impactful way. Incorporating 3D software in the design process, her brand manages to create pieces with zero waste by calculating exact quantities and 3D rendering. They also make use of infinitely recyclable 3D-printed aero aluminum. As consumers become more aware of sustainability and brands try to present themselves as environmentally-conscious, one could say that embracing technology is necessary for fashion to remain relevant in the future.
Furthermore, these technological innovations suggest that rather than infringing on age-old techniques, the use of computers, synthetic fabrics, and experimental methods are in fact part of the bold creativeness and constant reinvention that has driven high fashion forward. In Loewe Spring/Summer 2023, the brand collaborated with Spanish bio-designer Paula Ulargui Escalona, making fabric that grew plants like chia and catswort. The resulting garments were a marvelous fusion of nature, technology, and fashion, with long green sprouts that hung off coats like luxurious ostrich feathers. Much like Coco Chanel’s transgressive appropriation of menswear to redefine womenswear with sleek pants and well-tailored jackets, the use of materials in new and surprising ways shows just how crucial technology can be to fashion’s progress.
With the buzz that Coperni’s recent showcase generated, it is expected that other fashion houses will soon follow suit with bigger and bolder incorporations of technology into their collections. Brands like GCDS have even held entire fashion shows in virtual reality. Tech, as it seems, is not only a tool but also an inspiration for creators. Defined by heritage and tradition, fashion’s embrace of technology provides a microcosmic model for society at large, showing how newfangled tech could in fact provide opportunities for artistic creativity that could never exist in the past. The future of fashion remains excitingly unpredictable, in most part thanks to the exponential development of technology in tandem. The issue that remains in question is not whether technology will be featured, but just in what ways.

As TikTok and reality star Charli D’Amelio said herself, the next chapter of the D’Amelios’ lives is aptly described by the song “Getting Older” by Billie Eilish. Whereas Season One was filled with breakdowns and tears, the Season Two premiere of “The D’Amelio Show” shifts in a new direction, as both D’Amelio sisters take on new ventures. The episode takes an interesting look at what it's like to feel burnout and how nerve-wracking it can be to start a new journey.
The episode begins with a big reveal: Charli has decided to take a break from dance. She talks about how dancing started to feel more like her job and less like something she simply loved to do — a problem compounded by previous criticism of her dance career. Though without dance, Charli feels as though she’s wasting her fame, unlike her older sister Dixie, who remains focused on her music career. Fortunately, Dixie gives Charli a shoulder to lean on — and one last shot at dance — as she invites her to dance in her iHeartRadio Jingle Ball performance. This was a compelling moment in the episode, as viewers can surely relate to the anxiety from leaving something comfortable to explore the unknown. Although Charli talks about the pressures of being a celebrity, her fear of wasted opportunities humanizes her to viewers.
With the possible end to her dance career, Charli has started to look into new interests, such as music. Taking cues from her sister, she has started to quietly work with a vocal coach, seeing if she might also have a knack for the music industry. Drama is bound to ensue, however, as Charli and her parents decide not to tell Dixie, not wanting to create a fuss before she even knows whether she likes it or not. If Charli ultimately decides to stick with this new venture, we may start to see an unfortunate sibling rivalry form as both sisters attempt to navigate the music industry.
Indeed, Dixie seems to be taking her own singing career to the next level as we get a behind the scenes look at the preparation for her iHeartRadio Jingle Ball performance. She talks about feeling like a filler artist as the setlist for Jingle Ball includes very big artists such as Doja Cat and Lil Nas X. Her anxiety is palpable as she gets ready for the show, from her freaking out about performing after BTS to her getting a stress pimple in her ear the night before the show (yikes). However, we never get to see whether she nails or fails the performance, as the premiere episode ends with a frustrating cliffhanger.
Dixie’s Jingle Ball performance isn't the only thing we get an insider look at, as we also get to see what it's like having a relationship in the public eye. Dixie talks in-depth about how social media affects her relationship with fellow TikTok star Noah Beck. Viewers can feel Dixie’s frustration as she shines light on the irritating pressure to “prove” her relationship to her followers by interacting constantly with Noah on social media. It was this mounting stress that caused Dixie to ultimately decide to keep their relationship off social media entirely.
The Season Two premiere of “The D’Amelio Show” delivers on all fronts, giving viewers a good share of drama but also a deep and relatable look into the anxiety associated with trying new things. With promises of a look into Dixie’s journey at Jingle Ball and Charli’s endeavors to break into the music industry, this new season is off to a compelling start. Will Dixie bomb her performance at Jingle Ball? Will Charli start a music career and how will Dixie react? Will the sisters overcome the all-too-common sibling rivalry? Season Two promises we will find out all the answers, so long as we tune in.

The new AMC series “Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire” reimagines a classic vampire tale modernized in every way. The classic story, first told in Anne Rice's 1976 novel and then the Academy Award-nominated movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, follows a modern journalist who sits down with a centuries-old vampire to hear the stories of his past. The pilot episode effectively sets the scene for this same premise while making some key changes that improve on the storytelling.
The show begins with seasoned journalist Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian) traveling in post-pandemic 2022 to Dubai to meet Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson), a previous interviewee who wants to revisit their incomplete interview from decades back. Daniel agrees to a “do-over,” but not before pointing out that their last encounter had ended violently, as evidenced by a scar on Daniel’s neck and a tape recording of their fight.
From here, the show takes off as Louis narrates his past to Daniel. The modern-day interview simply acts as a framing device as most of the episode takes place in the past and these are the events at the core of the intrigue of “Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire.”
The series makes two major changes from the original novel and film: Louis’s story begins in 1910 rather than 1791, and Louis is mixed race as opposed to white. These changes affect the historical context and allow for a rich plot — the show is half vampire fantasy and half period drama, and its commentary on important themes like race and sexual freedom make the story all the more compelling.
When his story begins, Louis is a self-starter, supporting his family by questionable means as a pimp. Although he participates in high-class society, he is also prone to violent outbursts and deals with racial prejudice from his customers and colleagues.
Enter Lestat de Lioncourt (Sam Reid), a mysterious, rich Frenchman (and vampire) who begins “hunting” Louis, according to the narration. The two develop a friendship at first, but it is unclear exactly what Lestat is looking for until their tension culminates in sex and Lestat biting Louis. Louis is ashamed of the encounter and wants to repress his queerness, but Lestat convinces Louis that vampirism will give him the freedom to be himself.
The show aims to use vampirism as a metaphor for age-old struggles with mortality and depression. Louis struggles with people around him dying and accepting existence as a vampire means being able to become someone above humanity — not having to worry about death and being powerful enough to be less concerned with the human norms of society regarding race and sexuality that oppress Louis. In the present interview, the idea of immortality also appeals to the characters as they navigate the pandemic and it’s revealed that Daniel has Parkinson’s. These themes of existentialism are explored carefully as the writers are able to tie every variant in plot from the original story into deepening the idea that vampirism is more than an overdone cliché. The writing of the show succeeds in being more poetic than soapy or campy, unlike other vampire series from the last decade.
The 1994 film attempted to create a sense of horror, filled with scare tactics and special effects that come off as campy and overly exaggerated, but the show reimagines these moments using modern techniques that are more believable to watch. Rather than ineffective jump-scares, violence is often portrayed through carefully choreographed, gruesome shots similar to those made popular by “Game of Thrones.” Furthermore, the foreboding score and intricate costuming succeed in transporting viewers to a different era, adding to the elegance and seductiveness that the characters are meant to emanate.
Additionally, while there has always been discussion about queer undertones in both Rice’s novel and Cruise’s and Pitt’s portrayals, this subtext is fully realized in the show as Lestat’s and Louis’s romantic relationship is made canonical. Anderson and Reid have great chemistry and are each captivating on their own as attractive vampire heartthrobs.
As well done as it is, “Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire” isn’t a groundbreaking piece of art and will likely appeal only to fans of vampire flicks. Its portrayal of vampires with supernatural abilities inevitably comes off as ludicrous at some points. For instance, the way Lestat speaks to people in their minds is a bit much at times, as well as some of his other vampiric, exaggerated mannerisms. However, for those who have been longing for a vampire romance with the classiness of a period drama, this series is perfect.
Although the series’s premiere is promising, one area for improvement in the coming season is the further development of non-male characters. The story is entirely told by and centered around men — women are only seen through how they affect and relate to the men in the series. Lily (Naja Bradley), a sex worker to whom both Lestat and Louis take a liking, has a particularly alarming arc in the first episode. She is even more sexualized than the queer vampires, even though her sexuality is far less integral to the plot — and she is ultimately killed off simply because Lestat chooses to take his anger at Louis out on her. Based on the original novel and movie, we can anticipate Claudia (Bailey Bass), Lestat’s and Louis’ vampire child, entering the plot at some point this season, likely allowing for a more influential female character.
Overall, the show brings the seduction, murder, and escapism of the vampire genre into the high-quality television landscape of today. AMC may have begun the next vampire dynasty, and drawing an audience should be easy given the show’s successful source material. What’s more, its strong start exceeds expectations and should convince viewers to stick around this new take on the classic story.

On a quiet street just north of central Harvard Square, Bonde Fine Wines, a carefully-curated boutique shop laid down its roots in the midst of the pandemic. Walking into the shop, lucky passersby will immediately feel at home, or, at least, intrigued, by the casual leather armchair, bar stools, vintage cassette players, and welcoming French owner, Bertil Jean-Chronberg, standing just behind the bar.
“The less experience you have [with wine], the better you will find this place here,” said Jean-Chronberg, commenting on the inclusivity Bonde offers.
This is one of the many aspects of Jean-Chronberg that sets him apart from others in the wine industry. Jean-Chronberg, above all else, is devoted to wine. This passion may sound obvious, but in a world where social boundaries, prejudice, and tradition to a fault have consumed the wine industry, Jean-Chronberg is a breath of fresh air.
“Wine has always been a part of my life,” he said.
Born near the Pyrénées mountains in France, Jean-Chronberg grew up in Paris and moved to Montréal, Québec to attend university. Jean-Chronberg notes that, unlike many of their American counterparts, many French families at the time held a true appreciation and love for artisanal produce. With a family whose background is in art and viticulture, Jean-Chronberg matured with a strong belief that local artisan products should not be a luxury, but a normal part of life.
After graduating from university and receiving his masters degree, Jean-Chronberg set off on his path, always with his clear goal for the future in mind. It didn’t take him long, as Jean-Chronberg said: “I’m one of the recipients of the best sommelier award in ‘96,” awarded by the Canadian International Sommelier Competition.
Yet, even more, the celebrated sommelier continued to set himself apart from others in “le monde du vin.” Coming from a country with such devotion to their specific terroir and viticulture, Jean-Chronberg does not feel a need to overwhelm Bonde with French and other European wines. He, unlike many others, is committed to the pursuit of any and all artisanal wines and is not beholden to the country on the label or the money behind the company. Setting aside any bias towards French wines, Jean-Chronberg lives strongly by his values of promoting artisanal and local produce. So, basing himself in the United States, Jean-Chronberg proudly declares that 95% of the wines he sells are, in fact, American.
“I believe as of today, the United States has the most diversified wines and types of grapes of all other countries,” he said.
Despite his regional leanings, Jean-Chronberg is not sacrificing high-quality, European wines for the sake of local purchases, good or bad. He believes that American wines, including New England wines, have much to bring to the table. While France is committed to the past, the United States is committed to the future.
The United States, he said, is “not limited to all the old concepts and traditions and regulations of Europe.”
Without the pressure of conforming to the past, Jean-Chronberg explained that many American wineries involve experimentation, new methods, and innovation in the creation process. While some may argue that those European traditions uphold the integrity of fine wine, Jean-Chronberg believes that American wines are unique and special. Of course, Jean-Chronberg does not suggest that American wines are similar to French or Italian wines, nor do they offer the same qualities, but they certainly have their own individualized identities that are worth one’s attention.
More so, the United States’ approach to viticulture is unlike that of Europe because wine is not a necessity for Americans: It is a luxury product. According to Jean-Chronberg, many European countries expect wine with both lunch and dinner, making wine a key staple. This necessity, sadly, makes affordable wine an often mass-produced commodity in Europe. So, as Americans drink less wine more selectively, their ability to avoid mass production and focus on artisanal wineries still represents the majority in American viticulture.
“If you take a country like France, of the one hundred percent of wine that is produced, only ten percent is quality wine … in the United States, sixty percent of our produce is quality wine,” said Jean-Chronberg.
However, the sommelier does admit some foreign exceptions to his collections. In addition to a couple bottles of very fine French wine on the shelves, Jean-Chronberg will also occasionally feature a foreign bottle of wine to make a political statement. For example, Jean-Chronberg currently features fine wine from Ukraine, bringing attention to the country through their viticulture.
While it can be easy to adhere only to clear categories, Jean-Chronberg notes that one still cannot recognize wines as simply American, or French, or Italian: Wines are distinctive, intimate creations. This individualized sense of wine is a major part of Jean-Chronberg’s philosophy. A concept he invented, he asserts that each barrel of wine sold by a vineyard, when artisanal, is individual and unique. Like books, no two wines are the same, even when written by the same author. This concept highlights wine producers as artists, as artisans, who breathe life into their art.
Jean-Chronberg says, “It’s another palette, it’s another approach, it’s another level of wine.”
On top of this, an underlying theme of Bonde is to connect and strengthen the community through wine, hence the name: Bonde. Jean-Chronberg said “the complex structure of humans being in a group does not exist anymore,” noting that with an overconsumption of screens and technology in the modern generations, many people have lost touch with their communities. Yet, with wine, people can come together and appreciate a simple pleasure. At Bonde, organized tastings and private events are therefore an integral part of Jean-Chronberg’s mission.
“Bonde is a culture, it’s a culture of simple space,” he said.
Bonde, arguably the antithesis of mass production, is exclusively a gallery for artisan wines. Among many other aspects, Jean-Chronberg believes that true artisanal wines should be organic, environmentally friendly, and economically responsible.
“I believe a real winemaker will never need to be a millionaire or billionaire because they are artists and artisans,” said Jean-Chronberg. “They invest to be better.”
Winemakers are artists, there’s no doubt about that, and Jean-Chronberg takes the role of custodian and patron for this art, using Bonde as a platform of awareness. “If a wine is here, it is because it is special… The wine is quality… They have a big soul, they fight for what they’re doing,” said Jean-Chronberg.

Read and beloved by millions, “The Hunger Games” by Suzanne Collins is a book of brilliant plot, engaging prose, and an unforgettable story. The first book in The Hunger Games series took the literary world by storm in 2008, following a 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen as she voluntarily engages in a televised fight to the death among 23 other teenagers. Collin’s post-apocalyptic world became Amazon’s all-time best selling series in 2012, surpassing Harry Potter in just four years. “The Hunger Games” remains Amazon’s most sold book of all time in the United States. This raises the question: What about this novel creates such an immense, tangible fascination with The Hunger Games world?
I was first introduced to this world not by reading the book but by watching “The Hunger Games” when it was released in theaters in 2012. While I am not sure what made Collin’s tale stick to me, I knew I was hooked onto this YA series. Immediately, I grabbed a copy of the book and delved into Katniss’s hardships and triumphs. Reading the novel filled in the blanks of the story I saw on the screen — building a foundation for my admiration for Collin’s series that has lasted for over ten years. To this day, I continue to give the book a read each summer to revisit the story that has stuck with me for so long.
Fundamentally, Collins created a world of unmistakably interesting lore and plot — making it nearly impossible to forget the story of Katniss Everdeen. In “The Hunger Games,” the United States is known as Panem and split among 12 districts. 74 years before the book takes place, the districts rebelled against the governing body of the utopian city known as the Capitol. In response, the government created a barbaric reminder of their dominance: Each year, 24 tributes, made up of children aged 12 to 18 are sent to fight to the death. The book follows a first-person narration by Everdeen, who volunteers to take her younger sister’s place in The Hunger Games.
While the book consists of familiar, complex themes — such as civil war, political instability, and violent wealth inequality — Collins integrates these in innovative ways. Collins places the reader into the perspective of a young girl in an unimaginable situation. And yet, readers can still relate to her struggles of caring for her family and rebelling against those in power. Moreover, these themes are a poignant reflection of the modern United States. The series focuses on gaining freedom from an oppressive Capitol, and while they ultimately escape the corrupt democratic system, they find great difficulty in completing the task.
“The Hunger Games” also reigns superior in its depiction of human nature and relationships; the relationships between characters are dynamic and ever-changing as they navigate the priorities of survival and friendship. A lasting, heart-wrenching relationship that remains at the center of the Games is between Katniss and Rue, a small 12-year-old girl. Collins shines in her ability to create a robust bond between the two and break that connection within the span of less than a hundred heartbreaking pages.
This bond touched me not just because Rue’s innocence makes for a tragic death, but that in such a horrific place, both characters were able to protect and care for each other even though they came from different districts. As a reader, one can never forget Katniss singing Rue the song she used to sing to her sister of the same age as she dies in her arms, symbolizing the truly horrific yet intriguing nature of Collin’s world.
Similarly notable, Collins uses the romantic expectations of readers to further shape Katniss’ character. The second half of the Games focuses entirely on the relationship between Katniss and the boy tribute from her district, Peeta Mellark. As he is injured and she cares for him, one could assume that the book would focus on their romance. However, Collins provides a breath of fresh air from traditional romance YA books and their relationship is forged by deception, strategy, and companionship rather than outright love. Through Peeta, readers learn that Katniss is unlike so many female characters in YA before: She has a strength and independence that is not directly connected to the male protagonist. The book’s lack of romance does itself, and the genre, a great service.
Recently, the series became a tetralogy with the release of “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” in May 2020, a prequel to “The Hunger Games.” Most notably in The Hunger Games universe, however, is that “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” is currently being filmed for release as a feature film in November 2023. Seen explicitly in this prequel, my favorite parts of reading the series are the brilliantly laid connections and deeper meanings to several important events in the story. Thus, the lore of the characters and of the Games extends into a span of over 100 years and effortlessly reveals more about this fundamentally intriguing plot with each new chapter.
In the years following the book's release, many have attempted to tap into the growing dystopian YA craze. Such books, like “The Maze Runner” and “Divergent,” had well-received releases and even more successful motion picture releases; however, “The Hunger Games” still stands above all others.
As evidenced by the upcoming release of the series’ fifth movie, the Hunger Games holds its spot in popular culture and has remained in the hearts of many — and for good reason. Since 2012, "The Hunger Games” has been and will continue to remain at the top of my bookshelf.

“Life’s a fickle game we play,” sings British indie rock band Amber Run in their 2017 single “Fickle Game,” an existentialist inquiry into the uncertainty and arbitrariness of life. Released five years ago, the song and its album “For a Moment, I was Lost” kick-started the approach that would continue to be the band’s trademark: Raw, haunting honesty that refrains from sugarcoating.
Amber Run is best known for the single “I Found” from their debut album “5AM,” which has a theatrical, joyful sound and heavy production. By contrast, their second album was produced during a tumultuous time for the band, leading to its stripped-back sound that foregrounds the vulnerable honesty of the poetic lyrics. After the band’s label had dropped them and their drummer left, the trio had to deal with feelings of uncertainty, anxiety, and depression, all of which are reflected on “For a Moment, I was Lost.”
“Fickle Game” starts with a wistful piano intro that blends seamlessly with lead singer Joshua Keogh’s breathy vocals as he sings, “I want to be older / I want to be stronger / I don't want to fall at the start / I want to be quicker / I want to get closer / Don't want to feel worlds apart.” The repetition of “I want” in combination with these comparative adjectives describes the human yearning for stability in the most direct, honest form possible. If one were older, stronger, and quicker, life’s blows of fate might not throw one off balance so easily, Amber Run muses in these lyrics. The descending melodic line often utilizes painfully narrow intervals to underscore the ache in Keogh’s voice.
In the pre-chorus, the piano slows down by playing longer chords, abandoning Keogh whose voice now stands alone. The addition of somber, ethereal background vocals starkly contrasts Keogh’s melodic line which hurries in small steps around a single note. These musical techniques as well as the lyrics “'Cause I'm fast enough to get in trouble / And not fast enough to get away” essentially portray Keogh as a powerless human being trying to evade reality to no avail.
Before the chorus, the background vocals fade into silence right after the song’s most striking line, “And I’m old enough to know I’ll end up dying / And not young enough to forget again.” This haunting full stop — the sonical “death” of the song — forces the listener to contemplate the lyrics, which gives them no choice but to reciprocate Amber Run’s vulnerability. “The real beauty comes in the moments of self-doubt, but we’re all too scared to engage with it,” Amber Run told EUPHORIA. in an interview.
With breathy falsetto, Keogh sings that “It's all a fickle game / Life's a fickle game we play” in the chorus. The descending melodic line repeats four times, with Keogh’s voice rising up again and again without being able to escape from the game. “Fickle Game” also utilizes syncopation, a displacement of the regular metrical accent by stressing the weak beat. This melodical dance around the strong beats intriguingly expresses the “fickle” nature of life.
The second chorus gives way to a cathartic interlude, one of Amber Run’s trademarks. Reverberating guitar riffs and percussion swell dynamically as Keogh belts “It’s a fickle game!” This climactic bridge then fades into a quiet outro which again isolates Keogh’s voice as he resignedly sings, “I’m sick of fickle games.” In a circular format, the song ends as it began with the same wistful piano accompaniment.
“Fickle Game” is a desperate outcry against the disorienting absurdity and impermanence of life, a haunted yearning for stability and control, a solitary search for meaning. How, then, shall we play this fickle game? Amber Run, consistent with their rejection of artificial sugarcoating, does not answer this question. “Any which way you turn, there’s never the right answer in front of you,” the band told EUPHORIA. and another song from the album repeats the line “I’ve got no answers.” Perhaps, the answer is precisely that there is no answer. If we can set nothing against life’s uncertainties, the only thing left is to stop asking questions, to accept, and to surrender.

As a veteran of the pop industry, Carly Rae Jepsen knows how to reinvent herself. She found an acoustic folk debut in 2008’s “Tug of War” before she was more broadly introduced to audiences through her Grammy-nominated record “Kiss” — the album produced some of her most commercially successful singles like “Call Me Maybe” and “Good Time” with Owl City. Since her breakout success in 2012, Jepsen has shed the mainstream and found herself a darling of the indie-pop scene with the synth-pop and disco-inspired musings on her third and fourth albums, “Emotion” in 2015 and “Dedicated” in 2019.
Jepsen has dipped her toe into every genre; based on its available singles, “The Loneliest Time” looks to culminate every facet of a fifteen-year career. “Western Wind” is an instrumental dream, an earthy blend of piano and synths punctuated by gentle percussion. “Beach House” is a fun tongue-in-cheek and somewhat satirical ode to the struggles of modern dating, and “Talking to Yourself” is reminiscent of the bold sensuality of previous songs like “Stay Away” and “L.A. Hallucinations.” With an assist from Empress Of, Jepsen has embarked on the “So Nice” North American and European tour in support of “The Loneliest Time,” and stopped by Boston’s Roadrunner on Sept. 26.
A swath of red light bathed the stage and crowd, framing Jepsen’s silhouette and setting the tone for her setlist; passionate, energetic, fiery. From the literally star-studded staging to an anthropomorphic moon (voiced by Jepsen) that guided the audience through concert transitions to the opening lines of “This Love Isn’t Crazy” (“For some time, I’ve been waiting for your star to shine”), Jepsen’s performance was thematically celestial and ultimately otherworldly. Decked in a cloudy blue and white ensemble, she soared through the first act of her set.
The lesser-known selections like “Let’s Sort the Whole Thing Out” and “Window” were unencumbered by their relative obscurity as Jepsen’s innate theatricality brought her performance to new heights. Crowd favorites like “Run Away With Me” and “Emotion” were infused with an effortless effervescence, and though she’s certainly grown exponentially in the indie sphere, Jepsen didn’t shy away from her mainstream hits. “Call Me Maybe” and “I Really Like You” were delivered without any hint of self-deprecation but rather with a demonstrable giddiness and sincerity on par with the rest of her set.
With a 27-song setlist, Jepsen’s stamina was commendable. In leaping across the stage, trekking up flights of stairs to engage with the members of her band, and coordinating dances with backup vocalists Sophi Bairley and Julia Ross, the singer kept the energy up throughout her entire performance. With little room between songs and costume changes, Jepsen, with assistance from Bairley and Ross, made sure to engage with the crowd during her songs, casting her mic out and soliciting backing vocals from her audience.
Not to be outdone, Jepsen’s instrumentalists and backup vocalists also shine. Performances of “Run Away With Me” and “I Want You In My Room” were elevated by exceptional saxophone accompaniment from Jared Manierka, while the bridge on “Beach House” featured vocals from Manierka, along with tour guitarist Tavish Crowe, drummer Nik Pesut, and bassist Abe Nouri. Though these and other band interactions are campy and sometimes over-the-top, they are by no means ingenuine. Jepsen had effortless chemistry with every person on stage, some of whom have been performing with her for over a decade.
By the time Jepsen is closing out the show with another crowd-favorite, 2017’s “Cut to the Feeling,” now dressed in a black ethereally draped number, it’s abundantly clear to her audience why she’s been able to sustain such a lengthy career. Reinvention, be it from year to year or from song to song, is at the heart of her discography and performance. During the show, Jepsen has been able to easily acquaint her audience with newer music while refreshing older selections with her signature vitality. With an impressively diverse repertoire that blends lyrical depth with delightful instrumentation and production and her expertise as a performer, Carly Rae Jepsen is a joy to watch.
See Carly Rae Jepsen on her ongoing tour, and listen to her new album “The Loneliest Time” on Oct. 21.

Langhorne Slim has brought lyrics of hope, love, and spirit to a confusing world for over a decade. After a two year hiatus from playing shows with his band, he is back on the road to tour his 2020 album “Strawberry Mansion.” Before his Oct. 4 show at The Sinclair, The Harvard Crimson sat down with Langhorne to discuss life on the road and the healing power of music.
The Harvard Crimson: It’s been two years since “Strawberry Mansion” came out. How’s the tour going?
Langhorne Slim: Yeah, it’s crazy that it’s been two years. I didn't realize that. Time really never has worked in a linear fashion. I never believed that it really worked that way. Life as a traveling person, it certainly doesn't seem that way. Then add in the pandemic and it's very baffling. Things seem like they were a week ago or a thousand years ago at the same time.
There were all these different phases where we thought it was safe again and then shit got shut down again, so I’ve been back on the road playing shows for the past year, I think, but not with the band. So anyway, it doesn’t feel new to be on the road. But with the band we haven’t done a tour-tour since I don't know, six months or a year leading into the pandemic so it’s great to be touring with these guys again and to be playing more shows.
THC: What does it mean to be playing these songs from 2020, now?
LS: What I’ve really noticed on this tour is the pandemic, although nobody likes the reasons for it, it really enabled me much needed time to take care of myself and change the way I was living in certain ways.
I got clean. I got sober about 10 years ago and then I got un-sober, and right before the pandemic, a few months before, I got myself clean again, started going to therapy and stuff.
And really, out of desperation, kind of like, making some different life choices. And then I live in Nashville and we had a big tornado, and then we were in the pandemic. So it really forced us all to slow our roll down whether we wanted to or not, and to kind of take a look at the way a lot of us were living and coming out of it like, What did I learn while i was in my house? Or, what did I learn with the work I was doing on myself that I want to bring out into this world with me?
And I have just noticed feeling just so much more present with the band and enjoying my time during the day with these guys and laughing more and therefore the shows have been better, it just feels more connected.
Our band has been together for like 18 years, I’m told. Malachi the drummer told me.
And I’m like, ‘Holy shit that’s crazy.’ But it manages to feel fresh because of the changes I've gone through in my own life.
THC: This time with the pandemic and changing how you’re living your life, has that changed or brought new meaning to the songs you’re singing now?
LS: Oh yeah, sure. All the songs that went on to the “Strawberry Mansion” record were all written in the first two months of the pandemic, two or three months. And that was within a year of me — they’re not necessarily songs about getting sober, but they are songs that came out of like a real — the way I look at it is, I’ve been in one way or another running to or running from my whole life in some capacity, often not sure which one I’m doing. Being still and truly being still was never it.
As a little kid I wasn't able to do that much and then I got in trouble for that when I was a little kid in school, and then when I got older I got a job that allowed me to not be still. I think that being forced to be still and to change some of the different ways that I was living in a time that was so chaotic. You know it’s like there’s a fucking gobal pandemic but there’s also political unrest and social unrest and there’s all this Trump shit and everybody is just like losing their minds and at that time. Sort of paradoxically, I’m like in my house, finding I wouldn't say myself again, but like maybe myself in ways for the first time. Like finding some quiet and some peace when it felt like the whole world was on fire outside. And so maybe there was something to that.
I think it was just a healing time and songs started to show up as little kisses from the universe or something. Because when they don’t show up for a while, maybe I shouldn't admit it, but I get scared that they're not going to show up again.
THC: The band’s been together 18 years and you’ve been releasing albums for a little less time, but you've had a big impact on people for a long time, and still you're right around a million monthly listeners on Spotify, so what does it mean to you to know the effects you’re having on listeners who are going through some of the same things you’re going through, or not?
LS: That's the beauty of being back on the road, right? You know we all made do during the pandemic in certain ways, and some more people did more stuff online than others, but I was grateful for some opportunities online to connect with people. And actually that was my most healthy relationship, was social media, in that time. It felt more pure or something and it felt less gross in that I was writing songs posting them on instagram being upfront about how I was experiencing the pandemic life and stuff and so there was like an online connection that I got, but it's nothing like what we get when we’re on the road and playing in front of people.
You know[,] the whole idea has been to write music that is as true to myself as I can, and through that, to connect with others. So it feels, as I say on stage, it feels more human. The medicine of connecting with other human animals through art and music is, I'm convinced, is the most powerful divine medicine we have as people. We’re able to somehow get away from, for an hour or two hours, a lot of what I would consider bullshit and distractions that we walk in with. That lives in some unsayable land. I don’t have the words for what that is, but I know it’s like an ancient thing. And so to be back on the road and doing it is… I don’t know, not that it’s so important what we’re doing, but it feels important. The whole thing feels important.
You know art and music, the marriage of those two things, not art and music, art and commerce, it’s a strange dance that they do and i thnk its easy to get off the rails sometimes with the ego parts of it the money parts of it, this and that, I think when you’re not able to do it for a little while and you get to come back and plug your instruments in and light the fucker up and truly feel that conenction with other people. There’s no words for it, it still is the most incredible thing.
I tried lots of drugs, I tried lots of drinks. Some of them are good but there’s nothing as powerful as that.
THC: You say you don’t have the words but I think your lyrics do a pretty good job of describing that. Is there anything else you’d like to say about your tour?
LS: We’re out here! And it’s nice to talk to you man, I appreciate it. Thanks.

“Meet Cute,” a term that serves as the title for Peacock’s recent original film, embodies an entire romantic comedy trope. It refers to the initial interaction between two individuals that results in a romantic relationship, and these chance encounters are usually characterized by charming and/or amusing writing. There are countless examples of “meet-cutes” in mainstream film: Just take a look at “The Holiday” or “Reality Bites,” “The Big Sick,” or “(500) Days of Summer” (a true textbook example). Meet-cute films are everywhere, and upon learning the simplistic title of Peacock’s new film, one has to wonder how much a movie with this name can expand on such a widely represented, oft-repeating genre.
At the beginning, “Meet Cute” is exactly what one would expect. The movie opens on protagonist Sheila (Kaley Cuoco) sitting alone in a bar, where she eyes potential love interest Gary (Pete Davidson) as he scribbles on some stray coasters.
If you ignore Sheila’s dramatic pre-credits opening scene, where she hurries down a colorfully-lit nighttime street, as well as her strange quips that she’s from the future, this movie could be a carbon copy of countless meet-cute films of the past. Even Pete Davidson’s performance as reserved, awkward Gary isn’t all too jarring — although the fact that he was cast in the first place is a good indicator that the film probably won’t take itself too seriously.
And “Meet Cute” definitely doesn’t keep many cards up its sleeve — before the end of the first cliché bar run-in, the audience knows essentially everything they need to know about the movie. It’s a rom-com, of sorts, but there seems to be a half-baked attempt at irony within the setup, and Sheila also has control over the unsuspecting Gary through her time travel powers. There don’t seem to be many more layers for the audience to decipher throughout the film — but then again, “Meet Cute” does not seem to be aiming to engage the audience much intellectually.
However, it becomes clear that there are some darker underlying elements to this seemingly lighthearted film. When Sheila admits to Gary in yet another bar that she killed the version of herself from the future (before she traveled back in time), she elaborates in an offhanded tone: “My car, just like, vrrr, right over her face.” Pretty soon after this development, Sheila's complex motivations for traveling back in time are revealed, lending the film more emotional depth. The audience also holds witness to unsettling scenes of her indeed running her car over her own body on several occasions.
To say that the combination of these darker, more severe thematic moments with the lighthearted performances by the two main actors is unnerving would be an understatement. At the end of the day, Pete Davidson is Pete Davidson — regardless of how sincere a role he plays, it’s almost impossible to fully separate him from the comedic brand which launched him into fame. The fact that Davidson’s Gary is supposed to be an excessively normal, unfunny, bland guy leaves the audience expecting some sort of comedic shift in his character, and the lack of this transformation makes Gary seem almost ironic but unrealized. Although Gary has a handful of lines of halfheartedly funny dialogue throughout the play — on one of many repeated dates, he asks Sheila if she knew that the movie “Predator” had both Jesse Ventura and Arnold Schwarzenegger, concluding: “I mean, that has to be a Snapple fact, or something” — his character on the whole is underwhelming, and simply serves as a punching bag for Sheila's increasingly manic behavior.
In addition to its slightly off-putting mix of rom-com tropes and sci-fi psychological thrills, “Meet Cute” also takes a stab at social critique. On Sheila and Gary’s first date, they go to an ice cream truck, just to discover that the only flavor is “ice cream made out of milk left to soak for two weeks and Fruity Pebble cereal served on a cone made out of deconstructed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.” This criticism of modern upscale food trends is not a one-off — on a later date at a fancy restaurant, Sheila asks about a miniscule dish served to her: “Um, is that a tiny fish? Are we supposed to eat this stuff?” Later on during a fight, when Sheila reminds Gary that her actions came from a good place, he responds with flair, “Yeah, so did gender reveal parties.” Although in many cases the witty commentary in “Meet Cute” does not fall too far off the mark, the movie is juggling too many other genres and delivery tones for these quips to come off any other way than overkill.
At the end of the day, “Meet Cute” tries at too much, and succeeds at too little. The combination of a lighthearted, comedic framework with darker — and at times very serious — psychological themes, does not result in a successfully cohesive film. Despite the happy ending, “Meet Cute” cannot deliver on its many promises — but the lighthearted performances of Cuoco and Davidson are still inherently entertaining.

Only a handful of musical acts have undergone a sonic transformation as extensive as Aussie quartet 5 Seconds of Summer. The band — made up of Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, Calum Hood, and Ashton Irwin — was introduced to the music scene as a pop-punk boy band through hits such as 2014’s “She Looks So Perfect.” By 2018, the group had evolved to be unrecognizable, ditching the punk sound and boyband label through their next breakthrough hit, “Youngblood.” With the release of the group’s fifth studio album, the appropriately titled “5SOS5,” 5 Seconds of Summer undergoes a new round of reinvention, bringing a more mature sound and perspective, while breaking the mold of what defines a 5SOS song.
The album’s opener, “COMPLETE MESS,” a mellow reflection on messy relationships, was released as the album’s first single back in March of this year. In the intervening six months, 5SOS engaged fans with a steady stream of teasers, singles, and performances of then-unreleased tracks during the “Take My Hand” World Tour, which took the band across Europe and the Americas from April to July of this year. “BLENDER” became a quick fan favorite after being added to the “Take My Hand” setlist prompting fans to beg for its release, which “5SOS” eventually obliged. On the other hand “Easy For You To Say,” another track teased on tour, was only dropped upon the album’s release — but with odd production decisions and heavy vocal effects used on the chorus, the live performances outshine the recording.
“5SOS5” marks the band's first full-length release since 2020’s “CALM” which included hits “Easier” and “Teeth.” In the two years since, the band has been anything but idle. Irwin, the band’s drummer, became the first member to go solo with his 2020 debut album “Superbloom.” While Hemmings, 5 Seconds of Summer’s lead singer and rhythm guitarist, quickly followed suit with the 2021 release of his album “When Facing the Things We Turn Away From.”
The influence of both projects can be heard within “5SOS5.” Irwin’s exploration of the industrial rock landscape flows into the introspective album closer “TEARS!” While, the idyllic soundscape created for Hemmings’ album is borrowed for the delightfully sappy duet “Older.”
“5SOS5” also departs from 5 Seconds of Summer’s earlier sound by expanding the band’s vocal lineup. On “CALM,” 5SOS was able to shed their boyband image by centering Hemmings as the band’s frontman, providing lead vocals on all but one track on the album. Even with this shifting dynamic, longtime fans will be excited to listen as vocal moments from Clifford, Irwin, and Hood once again find themselves in the spotlight. Fans can also hear a surprise vocal performance on “Older” where Sierra Deaton, Hemmings’ fiance and former member of the X-Factor winning duo Alex & Sierra, sings with Hemmings in a heartwarming duet.
Across the album, 5SOS weaves a thread of nostalgia and reflection, a theme that flows as a natural continuation of “2011,” released last year in celebration of the band’s 10-year anniversary. Two of the best tracks on the album — “Bad Omens” and “Best Friends”— are a natural pairing examining downfalls and the peaks of friendship, respectively. On “Bad Omens” Hemmings laments his tendency to ignore red flags in toxic relationships, singing: “Heaven knows I should let go / It's nothing that I don't already know.” Whereas “Best Friends” presents a joyous and carefree celebration of friendship at its best exclaiming “I got the best friends in this place/ And I'm holdin' on.”
At 19 songs, the album does feel a bit bloated, particularly on the back half where songs like “Redline,” “Moodswings,” and “Flatline” blur together in a haze of falsetto and guitars. Pushing a few songs onto a separate deluxe edition would free up space for some of the better mid-tempo B-sides like “Bleach” and “You Don’t Go to Parties” to set themselves apart rather than getting lost in the mix.
Nevertheless, “5SOS5” is a testament to the growth and musical talent of 5 Seconds of Summer. The album marks the band's first independent release, as well as Clifford’s first go as producer for almost the entire album. While it doesn’t present the same cohesion as “CALM,” “5SOS5” shows off of a mix of surefire hits and experimental feelers, promising further growth and exploration in the band’s future.

With his wild blonde curls tamed beneath a blue beanie, singer-songwriter Briston Maroney paused for just a moment after each question before flashing a knowing grin. Plain-spoken yet somehow effortlessly lyrical, his answers were thoughtful and honest — windows into the indie/alternative artist’s mind.
“I have a really odd brain,” he said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
With all of his unassuming charm, little comments like this are common. To call the Nashville-based artist humble would be an understatement. In fact, he seems genuinely convinced that being a musician is too good to be true — a dream from which he could wake at any moment.
“Every few days, I’ll find some new hobby or something that I’m interested in, and I’ll be like ‘Oh great, so when music inevitably fails tomorrow, I can just start selling sweaters,’” he said.
A storyteller at heart, Maroney makes his music personal. Each song paints a vivid image of a singular moment, either real or imagined. Poignant lyrics are wrapped up in unique alt musicianship.
Fans adore the raw emotive power of his music, drawn to his signature sound and undeniable authenticity. Listening to Maroney’s music means being transported, whether to a midnight drive on his 2018 single, “Freakin’ Out On the Interstate,” or to the middle of campus in his newest song “Harvard,” which was released on Friday, Oct. 14.
“Harvard” is the perfect combination of Maroney’s alt sensibilities and lyrical storytelling. Featuring the moody guitar riffs he has perfected on tracks such as “I’ve Been Waiting,” and “Small Talk,” the instrumentation oscillates in tandem with the melody until it bursts to the forefront at each repetition of the chorus. Voice wafting in and out between verses, he sings to “Evelyn,” lamenting in the chorus that “I know that there’s a window to your heart that I’m not seeing through / I just got to find a way in.”
The single forms half of a two track release along with a song entitled “Oregon.” Both serve to solidify Maroney as a voice for an entire generation. “I am really inspired by college-age people who are so brave to take a leap,” he said, speaking about the impetus for “Harvard” and for several of his other songs. “This song really embodied the idea of false confidence and being confident without necessarily having the experience to back it up,” he said.
At 24, Maroney is just a few years older than those college-age kids who inspire him — close enough to remember the vivid emotions of late adolescence but with enough distance that he can meaningfully reflect on his experiences. Yet, his songs are not meant to glean sweeping insights about life. Maroney excels at taking listeners on a journey and asking audiences to feel, all without imposing expectations of what those feelings or interpretations should be.
“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with just saying what happened,” he said about his policy of honesty in telling stories, a skill he has developed over a lifetime in music.
Maroney made his first foray into the music world at 16 with a Top 30 stint on Season 13 of American Idol, but it was songwriting that truly allowed him to develop his own voice as an artist. Starting out, he would spend hours with his guitar playing chords until something clicked. But now, rather than hunting down the perfect melody, he said that “creativity is a lot more sporadic.”
Whether that means remembering small guitar riffs from sound checks, or recording twenty second melodies, even little throwaway phrases in a conversation can become catalysts for creativity. “I try to be really open,” he said.
“There’s a 98% chance I’m never going to use it,” he said when describing his process of noting these tiny moments, “but if something still hits emotionally a couple of weeks after it just passes through the brain, that’s usually where I start.”
He described the process of honing in on an idea as if it were a camera lens moving in and out of focus, with shifting themes and converging ideas. Of course there is always the pressure to resonate with audiences, but Maroney’s ability to write what he remembers is what brings such tangible authenticity to the forefront of his music.
“When more people are attentive, it’s exciting, but I hope that this thing that feels like magic, that I have no control over, doesn’t just go away,” he said of the leap of faith he takes whenever a song is finally ready for the world to hear. In fact, over the next few weeks, he is taking several of these daring leaps, first with the Oct. 14 studio release, and then with presenting his own set of live performances.
The Paradise Festival, a two day music event hosted in Nashville’s Brooklyn Bowl, is slated for Nov. 3 and 4. Headlining both days, Maroney serves as a mentor for the indie bands that round out the lineup such as The Greeting Committee, Annie DiRusso, and Indigo De Souza.
“It’s been terrifying, but really rewarding,” Maroney said when talking about curating the festival, and deciding how to infuse his personality into the performances. Printed across vibrant posters in a puffy bubble-letter font, “Paradise” promises to be the exact epitome of the unique vibe Maroney’s fans know and love.
Live performance has been an integral part of Maroney’s career, opening for artists such as Jack White and Rainbow Kitten Surprise. He said that these experiences have allowed him to “be in the same physical spaces as some of the bands that have represented music being a legitimate career.”
Maroney also said that his March 2022 performance at Cambridge’s own venue, The Sinclair, was one of his absolute favorites on “The Sunflower World Tour,” and that he would love to return to Boston as soon as he can.
Genuine, creative, authentic, and potentially equally happy selling sweaters or performing in front of thousands, Maroney is truly one of a kind. No matter if you have already met “Caroline,” ridden the “Rollercoaster,” or been “Freakin’ Out On the Interstate,” everyone should travel to “Harvard” with him.

Whether you know him as Evan from the musical “Dear Evan Hansen” or its more controversial 2021 film adaptation, as Payton from Ryan Murphy’s “The Politician,” or as Benji from “Pitch Perfect,” Ben Platt’s angelic voice and charisma are always present no matter what character he takes on. On the fourth stop of his Reverie tour at Boston’s Agganis arena on Sept. 29, Ben Platt had to tackle a new character, perhaps the hardest one yet: himself. With a background in musical theatre and a gigantic part of his fanbase who discovered him while he was still doing eight shows a week, Platt has made his mark on theater kids everywhere, but is he trying to expand his audience and step away from that sound?
The concert began with openers Aly & AJ, a sister duo who, although underwhelming with their acoustic guitars in front of an audience who had mostly yet to arrive, proved mighty. As they worked their way through an impressive eight-song setlist, they weren’t afraid to encourage the audience to stand, take their flashlights out, and sing-along. By the end of their set, the audience was captivated and turned electric when they played one of their oldest, but recently Tik Tok-famous, hits, “Potential Breakup Song.” Their excitement and confidence built up the perfect amount of momentum to introduce Ben Platt and set the tone for the rest of the night.
In the moments before Platt’s entrance, the audience was entertained with songs probably found on the top millennial hits of the 2010’s. As his signal that the concert was starting and maybe even his motivation song, Beyonce’s “Cuff It,” blasted as a blackout ensued and a light show started. Throughout the concert Platt’s artistic touch could not only be seen through his music, but also through the light hues and colors he chose to tell his story, which matches perfectly with one of his motifs that his “journey’s still a fairytale.”
He started the set off with the first song on his new album ‘“Reverie,” “King of the World Pt 1.” His melodic backup singers, all dressed in white, heavily loomed over the song, and it was interesting that throughout the concert he continuously shifted the focus to them, allowing {hem to share the spotlight and enjoy the crowd’s love.
As a result of Platt working in an environment where swings and people who specialize in behind the scenes magic are an integral part of his shows, it is no surprise that Platt took several opportunities to highlight his singers, band, and production team and all of their contributions. He even brought Aly and AJ back onstage to sing a song with him and emphasize to the crowd that they were more than just the opening band.
Although it is possible that Platt wants a sound that sets him apart from the Broadway world, his attention and detail that he puts into his lyrics and sound create the exact same effects that a musical would. Each album he tells is not just a story, but it has musical motifs, conflicts, and a plot that even ends with a musical happy ending or good note. His concert even felt as though it was separated into acts with an intermission from his music where he actually paid homage to musical theatre and sung a song from Sara Bareilles’s “Waitress.”
{image id=1358485 align=center size=large caption=true}
Unlike other artists who are focused on costume changes and dynamic sets, Platt sought to create a comforting, pressure free experience as he improvised his eccentric dance moves in a baggy pink-shirt ensemble. This was also apparent when he took a break from singing to express his sentiments, joys, and anxiety of performing again for the first time in three years as a result of the pandemic. He then addressed all of the college students in the crowd, and took a moment to sing an unreleased song that shared his feelings about growing up and figuring out life as a young person, a tone that can be found in a lot of his work including his role as Payton Hobart in Ryan Murphy’s “The Politician.” He played a piano solo while singing the song, creating a personal and bittersweet tone.
It is clear that whether or not Platt views his time in musical theatre as a part of his past, his new sound and style will always have a little bit of musical theatre in it. Platt’s work shows his path as an artist and creator is ever changing, as he is also figuring himself out, as we all are. Platt reminds the crowd that through this constant questioning and internal battles, happiness is one step closer if you “love what you do.”

Human fascination with the macabre and the uncanny forms the psychological raison d’etre for “Smile,” written and directed by Parker Finn. Sharply crafted with the intellect and intuition of a studied horror buff, Finn’s feature-length directorial debut uses the image of a distorted smile as a springboard for a successfully blood-curdling, if not wholly revelatory, film.
Doubly traumatized by her mother’s suicide and by a shocking event involving one of her patients, psychiatrist Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) begins to be tormented by a leering, ill-intentioned entity that takes the form of people she knows. The storyline is certainly not the most original and follows the expeditious structure of an investigation — undertaken by the haunted protagonist — of previous victims in an effort to learn about and break free from a curse (the acclaimed “It Follows” (2014) employs this same structure). Still, the movie’s premise smartly capitalizes on the all-too-human glee and fear induced by the image of the uncanny smile, which is already a common motif in the horror genre but used with full force in Finn’s feature debut.
Indeed, the sudden image of a menacing grin powers several well-executed jump-scares throughout the movie, although they do become more and more predictable as the rhythm of the film becomes familiar to the audience. And yet there’s no doubt that at least some viewers will be screaming bloody murder in their seats, due in large part to the godly work done by Cristobal Tapia de Veer on the film’s soundtrack. Through music, the supernatural voice in “Smile” erupts so explosively, violently, and terrifyingly at key moments, that audiences can’t help but feel physically swallowed up by the monster’s chorus. Even in less eventful scenes, Tapia de Veer shapes a leitmotif that foregoes the subtle and instead underscores the intense and heavy omnipresence of the supernatural.
So “Smile” succeeds in being scary — which, for some audiences, is all a horror movie needs to do. But for a film that presents itself as a meditation on mental illness, “Smile” doesn’t really come at the topic with any fresh ideas: cinematography- or narrative-wise. Wide overhead tracking shots and Dutch-angle stills indicative of a detached and decidedly supernatural perspective have become such standard tools for the craft of modern horror movies that their unironic use nowadays — as is the case with “Smile” — comes off as uninspired. Still, Finn finds such a compelling symbol of horror in the abject smile that the banality of the cinematography can be written off as an eager, first-time director’s homage to the historical stylistic methods of the genre. Besides, cinematographer Charlie Sarroff’s work, although transparent and questionably executed, at least reads as thematically apt. Blurred-background commercial close-ups nonetheless demand a closer scrutiny on the part of the viewer towards characters’ facial expressions and the emotions and intentions hidden beneath them.
Less forgivable is the superficial way the script treats the inescapability of mental illness and the stigma that frequently comes with it. As a psychiatrist, Rose Cotter is laughable, since her particular brand of therapy for her patients lies in rote assurances and in a surprisingly unempathetic approach to dialogue. A combination of cliché scriptwriting and hollow delivery keeps the audience doubtful, at the beginning, of Sosie Bacon’s ability to inhabit her character. Once Bacon loses this detached facade, however, and embodies the anguished and terrified woman Rose later becomes, she erases all initial doubts with a commanding and often heart-rending performance. Due in part to Bacon’s acting, “Smile” forms an effective meditation on the sheer anguish produced by the anxiety of a haunting and a confrontation of one’s own (inevitable and in this case, ritualized) mortality.
“Smile” especially struggles with its un-nuanced depiction of the social consequences of mental illness via the deteriorating relationships of the “insane” — Rose, her suicidal mother, her patients, and the other victims of the evil, leering entity — and the “sane,” represented by Rose’s fianceé, her millennial caricature of a sister, and her sympathetic cop ex-boyfriend. It’s hard to take the film’s stance on mental illness seriously when the “sane” hurl such juvenile insults such as “nutcase,” “headcase,” and the inevitable “crazy” at Rose. The supporting characters’ dogged and even comical refusal of empathy feels dissonant with the fastidious commitment to realism deployed in Rose’s emotional journey, and displays a sort of tepid half-heartedness towards — even an appropriation of — the subject of mental health for the sake of appearing cerebral.
Although “Smile” fails to evince any artful portrayal of mental illness, it at least succeeds in a more fundamental, instinctual task of the horror genre — to scare, and to scare thoroughly. Ticket-holders, beware: Watch at your own peril.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Halloween is just around the corner, and with it comes an enormous sampling of all things spooky. Curating a lineup of the finest horror stories to celebrate the scariest time of year, The Harvard Crimson kept in mind that our readers have discerning palates for horror. So, like any great taste-testing should, this list begins with the mildest of tales, culminating in those stories only fit for those with particularly strong appetites and even stronger stomachs.
“The Fall of the House of Usher” by Edgar Allan Poe
Spook scale: 3/5
Anything from horror icon Poe is a safe bet for an October read-a-thon, but the story of the twisted Usher family is simply unmatched. No Halloween season is complete without Poe.
“The Monstrumologist” by Rick Yancy
Spook scale: 3.3/5
This book combines a gothic atmosphere with the adventurous fun of a Rick Riordan novel, following teenager Will Henry in his monster-hunting adventures as an apprentice to a famed monstrumologist. While the series appears on young adult bookstore shelves, the scares are real.
“Frankenstein” by Mary Shelley
Spook scale: 3.5/5
With a darkened laboratory, a mad scientist, and a hulking green monster coming to life, a universally recognizable set of images accompanies this Victorian classic. However, Shelley’s novel also challenges readers to look beyond preconceived notions of monstrosity and humanity.
“Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” by Alvin Schwartz
Spook scale: 3.75/5
Accompanied by perhaps the most haunting illustrations ever included in children’s literature, courtesy of artist Stephen Gammell, these stories are a must, especially for anyone whose childhood was limited to fairy tales where good predictably triumphed over evil.
“Hide” by Kiersten White
Spook scale: 4/5
When protagonist Mack enters the contest, the rules are simple. Spend seven days hidden in an abandoned amusement park, outlast the thirteen other competitors, and don’t get caught. As the game goes on, and players begin to disappear, it becomes clear that something far more sinister is afoot.
“House of Accidents” by Chuck Wendig
Spook scale: 4.25/5
Published in 2021, the novel centers around a single family’s supernatural encounters upon returning to their home in rural Pennsylvania. Wendig crafts a tour de force of interdimensional horror that any “Stranger Things” fan is bound to love. Don’t be intimidated by its hefty 530 pages, “House of Accidents” will not only draw you in, but will leave you wanting more.
“Head Full of Ghosts” by Paul Tremblay
Spook scale: 4.5/5
For fans of William Peter Blatty’s “The Exorcist,” Tremblay’s 2015 novel presents a modern-day reimagining of the possession story with all of the bone-chilling tension and decidedly less split-pea soup. In this novel, the Barretts appear to be a typical suburban family until their daughter begins to exhibit the hallmark symptoms of demonic possession.
“The Haunting of Hill House” by Shirley Jackson
Spook scale: 5/5
Please excuse the annoying, “The book was better!” exclamations for a minute. While millions of viewers tuned in for Netflix’s 2018 adaptation of this classic horror novel, the book presents a decidedly more nuanced take on the haunted house trope, following four ghost hunters: Dr. Montague, a professor obsessed with the occult, Luke, the heir to Hill House, Theodora, a clairvoyant, and Eleanor, the compelling protagonist. Even for Halloween enthusiasts with busy fall schedules, at just 180 pages, a trip to Hill House is a must.
“Bones and All” by Camille DeAngelis
Spook scale: 5/5
Do not be fooled by the shrieking hordes of Timothée Chalamet fans tittering with anticipation for the Nov. 18 release date for the film adaptation. This book is utterly terrifying. The story follows sixteen-year-old Maren Yearly’s journey to find her father. Along the way, she falls into an unlikely romance, and the book feels like the typical coming-of-age story. That is, until she is overtaken by the urge to eat someone. Enough said.
“Pet Sematary” by Stephen King
Spook scale: 5/5
Any true horror enthusiast should be physically pained to choose just one Stephen King novel. But, while nothing beats the prom scene in “Carrie,” or the haunted mountain retreat of “The Shining,” “Pet Sematary” is the best King novel to get into the Halloween spirit. Delivering spooky graveyard scenes, gory imagery, and arguably the most terrifying cat in all of horror, this cult classic truly cannot be missed.

The Grolier Poetry Book Shop celebrated its 95th anniversary on Sunday, Oct. 9. Just down the street from The Harvard Crimson, the Grolier has stood between the Harvard Book Store and Hampden Hall for all 95 years of its existence. On Sunday, over 20 poets and friends of the Grolier convened on Brattle Street for live poetry readings and music.
Porsha R. J. Olayiwola, a Boston-area poet and educator, performed several original poems that covered themes ranging from water to the Black diaspora. Several poets, including herself, presented new, unpublished poems from manuscripts in progress. One of Olayiwola’s performed poems was an “eavesdrop-cento,” a collection of quotations inspired by her time in Provincetown, MA this past summer.
“As a person who writes specifically poetry, I think it's imperative to have poetry-specific places,” Olayiwola said. “Poetry needs to become institutionalized as an art form, as a literary form, because it’s embedded in our everyday lived experiences, and how we perceive the world.”
For Anna V. Q. Ross, a poet and poetry editor who also performed at Sunday’s street festival, the Grolier community has been pivotal in her life and her work since she moved to Boston over 20 years ago. She read pieces from her newest collection, which comes out next month — poems that grapple with motherhood and school shootings.
“Early on in my teaching career, I had a student, midway through the semester, raise his hand and ask, ‘Do people still write poetry?’” Ross said. “I realized that in order for us to have poetry be a living art, we need to make sure our students know that it's in the world right now. That’s what the Grolier does.”
James G. Fraser, who has been manager of the Grolier since Feb. 2022, said he first came to the shop after being invited to work as a stage manager for the shop's poetry festival. He stayed, however, for the poems. “I love books, so naturally this was a good place to be,” he said.
The Grolier was founded in 1927 by Adrian Gambet and Gordon Cairnie, whose portraits adorn the walls at 6 Plympton St. along with photos of other patrons. According to Fraser, Cairnie ran the Grolier as a first-editions and rare books and poetry bookstore. He established it as a place where the local literati would hang out.
“Gordon was friends with the likes of Ezra Pound and James Laughlin, and many other Harvard students, ” said Fraser. “For example, Frank O'Hara used to come in here back in the day.”
But Fraser noted that Cairnie’s shop wasn’t always inclusive: “During the Gordon era, it was known as a boys club. There was a couch where the register is currently and people would just come in here and hang out; Gordon wasn't really concerned with selling books, he’d just give them away.”
It was in the 1970s, when Louisa Solano became owner of the shop after Cairnie’s death, that the Grolier became the poetry emporium that it is today and took on a more inclusive atmosphere.
In 2006, the Grolier was sold to Ifeanyi Menkiti, poet and professor of philosophy at Wellesley College, who ran the store until his passing in 2019. The shop is still owned and operated by his family, whose mission is to continue to advance its poetry focus.
Andrea L. Fry and John M. Fry, two attendees of the 95th anniversary celebration, said they come all the time to the Grolier. The late Ifeanyi Menkiti was Andrea’s uncle.
“Ifeanyi not only kept [the Grolier] alive but kept it growing, and it continues to grow under the leadership of his family, of his wife, Carol, and their daughter, Ndidi. We’ve grown with it, and it’s become very important to us,” said Andrea, who is a nurse practitioner and published poet.
Independent poetry shops mean the world to people like John and Andrea. “These are the people who organize other people’s thoughts; they manage other people’s expectations in terms of poetry,” John said. “That’s true in New York as well as Boston with the Grolier.”

“A boy’s quest in a fantasy realm” could refer to at least four different Stephen King stories. Both “The Dark Tower” and “The Stand” feature a young boy. In “The Talisman,” 12-year-old Jack Sawyer ventures into another world to save his mother. And so when Stephen King released “Fairy Tale,” the story of a teenage boy in a fantasy realm who must fight an evil lord to save his dog, there were good reasons to expect an unoriginal, if decent, tale that fits right into King’s bibliography. But the straightforward narrative, heavily drawing on his favorite motifs and folk tales, makes for a surprisingly innovative, enjoyable story.
The novel follows 17-year-old Charlie Reade, a high school student from rural Illinois. One day, alerted by the barking of a dog, he rushes to the manor of a reclusive, elderly man named Mr. Bowditch, who has broken his leg after falling off a ladder. Charlie becomes Bowditch’s caretaker, and in the process, befriends the man and his dog Radar. But Bowditch is hiding much more than a kind heart under a grumpy façade: Under the floor of his old shed, a well leads into the magical realm of Empis, whose treasures — gold and an enchanted dial with the ability to de-age — Bowditch has been taking advantage of until becoming bored with life.
Months pass. Bowditch dies of a heart attack, but not before sharing his secrets with Charlie. The boy, knowing the dog will soon follow in his owner’s footsteps, decides to venture down the well, in the hopes of prolonging Radar’s life. His mission, however, quickly changes from saving the dog to saving the land of Empis from the evil lord who destroyed it.
There isn’t much more to the story’s protagonist than meets the eye. King writes,“You may have gotten a pretty good feeling about young Charlie Reade by this point, I’d guess—sort of like a hero in one of those YA adventure movies … strong and tall, no acne.” He insists Charlie’s “not so nice”: His protagonist is supposed to be an average teenage boy who pulled a couple mean pranks such as putting firecrackers in a mailbox or “dogshit on the windshield” of a car. But all things considered, the initial diagnosis is correct. Charlie is a noble character who risks his life for his dog and in the process saves the world.
But there’s no need for King to defend his choices. There's a certain charm to the hero’s simplicity and unambiguity, his moral rectitude and selfless drive, even if it makes the first third of the book read like Nora Roberts’s or Danielle Steel's attempt at a high school protagonist and his adventure. Charlie himself never quite becomes a three-dimensional character. But in the end, he and the story are none the worse for it.
The narrative itself isn’t any more complex. The self-imposed mission is not straightforward: there are some twists and turns. Charlie faces setbacks. But ultimately, as a fairytale prince, if not the prophesied one, he is set to prevail.
What the story lacks in terms of complexity, it makes up for in the richness of its world and details. King doesn’t shy away from acknowledging the book’s influences. Charlie himself remarks that the well leading to a world full of gold and a giant guarding it bring to mind the image of “Jack and the Beanstalk.” Two of his antagonists are described as looking like Grimms’ “Rumpelstiltskin.” A fountain palace was inhabited by a mermaid, but not “Ariel, the Disney princess.”
But the references to fairy tales and King’s frequent returns to his own leitmotifs don’t bring with them a sense of derivativeness or unoriginality. “Fairy Tale” is more reminiscent of a palimpsest, one that doesn’t simply cover old manuscripts, but skillfully incorporates the visible traces of folk tales and common fable motifs — or perhaps a collage arranging cultural and literary tropes into an uncomplicated but entertaining narrative.
“Fairy Tale” checks off all the boxes of a Stephen King novel. The main protagonist — a resident of a small town — has his life uprooted by a fantastical event. There’s alcoholism involved. The only thing missing is one of the protagonists being an English major. But King doesn’t simply repackage his favorite motifs. By mixing them with folk tales, he creates a refreshingly original story that he manages to execute well, perhaps precisely because of its simplicity.

Madeline Miller’s “Galatea” is a 21st century “response” to Ovid’s interpretation of the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea, told from the perspective of the previously nameless sculpture turned human, Galatea herself. In the original story, Pygmalion builds the most beautiful woman in the world out of ivory and makes her his wife after Venus turns her human. Miller’s chilling retelling dissects the moral implications of creating a person and then marrying them. In her version, Pygmalion, who is never named and only referred to as “my husband” by Galatea, keeps her locked away and watched constantly by a doctor and a nurse. Miller’s retelling deals with themes such as personhood, female subjugation, and male pleasure — subjects that were only alluded to in the original. Though the story is short, Miller does a decent job of exploring these ideas through Galatea’s voice, although she falls short when it comes to the development of other characters.
In the story, Miller asks what it means to be a person. Galatea can speak, she has feelings, and she can even give birth, but she is “born” subordinated to her husband — who sees himself as her father, mother, and brother as well. Miller’s version of this story examines the ethics of this relationship and probes at its incestuous implications as she seeks to answer the question, can you really create your own lover? This question becomes even more uncomfortable due to her husband’s fetishization of her “birth,” as he makes her reenact it for his sexual gratification.
Miller illustrates Galatea’s husband’s frustration with the imperfections associated with womanhood. “They are ugly,” he says of her stretch marks — marks she developed after being pregnant with his child. While Galatea sees these marks as a “sign” of their child, he sees them as a sign of her body’s imperfection. Miller excels at portraying the male desire for female purity. In the original story, Pygmalion makes his wife because he is disgusted by the promiscuity exhibited by the women of his time. Miller explores this idea further by focusing on the contradiction between this hatred for women and desire for their bodies. Miller makes it clear that Pygmalion enjoys the idea that he made Galatea because he knows she would be a virgin, untouched by any man before him. He feels entitled to her body, and if he ever feels challenged by her in any way, he reacts with violence.
Miller prompts a discussion about male pleasure derived from female pain. When Galatea apologizes to her doctor, she is led to believe that “he liked that.” When she cries in front of him, she says, “that had been his favorite time.” The doctor’s presence is suffocating to Galatea. She notes that the room she is confined to “was smallest of all with the doctor in it.” The other male character, her husband, leaves bruises on her body and blissfully compares her body to a canvas, further dehumanizing her. “The color is perfect,” he says of her bruises, as if he were an artist who is free to do whatever he would like to her body.
Miller’s new, more nuanced characterization of Galatea is the highlight of this story, but unfortunately she is the only multidimensional character. Perhaps this was purposefully done, considering that her character in the original myth was never given a voice, and that she now rests in control of her own narrative. Yet while there is only so much character building that can be done in a mere 50 pages in a book about female subjugation, it would have been nice for Miller to pay more attention to the other women in the story — or at least the relationships between women, especially between Galatea and her daughter, Pathos, or Galatea and her nurse. For example, Miller hints at how women can be perpetrators of violence against other women — by highlighting, for instance, the nurse’s complacency while the doctor and Galatea’s husband mistreat her — but she could’ve delved it deeper.
Madeline Miller’s presentation of this myth of Pygmalion and Galatea finally gives Galatea the name, voice, and complexity she deserves. She challenges the reader to think about consent, and she shines a light on the fetishization of female anguish and complete subordination. This beautifully written commentary on “male fantasy” and male anger directed at independent women brings this myth down to earth. Galatea is a relatable character and a strong heroine who makes her mark in a mere 50 pages.

Ling Ma made a bold entrance into the literary world with the release of “Severance” in 2018. Her debut novel received praise from critics and casual readers alike, earning a spot on the first syllabus of Harvard’s contemporary literature course, Literature Today. But an author’s second publication is what determines whether they will become a defining voice of their era or a one-hit wonder. In September, Ma released “Bliss Montage,” a collection of short stories that grapple with fundamental human experiences through a blend of fantasy and reality. The collection far exceeds the expectations set by “Severance” and reaffirms Ma's brilliance.
Ma’s writing in “Bliss Montage” is descriptive but not excessive. Her sentences are often short, but their brevity does not come at the expense of impact. Every word contributes to the narrative, written with intention. She avoids flat language, employing striking imagery in even the most mundane moments to craft an immersive sensory experience. Whether describing the “raptor rasp” of someone’s voice, the sensation of “scalding” water while hand-washing dishes, or a character whose scent is “redolent of a tangy pine,” Ma’s mastery of language entices readers to step into her narrative world.
The collection excels in many ways, but one of the most notable is its achievement of balance. The stories are both serious and absurd, dark and humorous, set in the past and present. Ma’s protagonists are burdened by the weight of negative emotions like fear, grief, and discomfort, but their narratives are also lightened by fantastical moments. In “Los Angeles,” for instance, the narrator must navigate the tensions of her marriage while sharing a mansion with 100 ex-boyfriends. In “Yeti Lovemaking,” the narrator is grieving a past relationship when she goes home with a man who reveals himself to be not human, but a yeti that follows a plant-based diet. Ma explores authentic experiences in unrealistic contexts. She gives herself room to experiment with characters, setting, and plot in ways that would be impossible within the confines of reality.
The structure of each story is made dynamic and engaging by alternations between the past and present. Ma is not reckless when transitioning from one period of time to the next; she is careful, clear, and considerate of readers who may otherwise get lost. Each detour into the past clarifies what is happening at present, providing background that helps to explain complex interactions between characters.
Ma’s vivid writing style and deliberate composition make her stories easy to follow. At the same time, she keeps certain elements of narratives shrouded in mystery. In “Los Angeles,” she replaces the spoken words of the narrator’s husband with dollar signs. Readers can infer what he says based on the length of his quote or the narrator’s responses, but his exact statements are never revealed, left up to the audience’s imagination. Ma also withholds the names of some characters; she refers to them by the role they serve, such as “the Husband” or “the Professor.” This decision gives stories a more universal quality. Readers navigating similar circumstances — whether in love, loss, academia, dissatisfaction with identity, or the second-generation Chinese-American experience — can pull from their own lives to build upon Ma’s nonspecific descriptions and cultivate more rounded characters.
Also shrouded in mystery are the stories’ endings. This is not a book for people who require closure. Ma doesn’t tie up loose ends; instead, she concludes stories with a scene that could lead the characters in a number of different directions. By the end of the collection, it feels like her characters are still out there, picking up where her writing left off and navigating the narrative world that she has cleverly left open for imagination. But this ambiguity is more exciting than frustrating — it makes the collection interactive, forcing readers to engage with rather than passively absorb the text.
Ma further demonstrates her thoughtful narrative composition through meta moments in which the short story collection nods to itself and its author. In “Peking Duck,” the narrator, like Ma, is a writer. Readers are granted access to a piece from the narrator’s short story collection, which displays persimmons on its cover — the cover of Ma’s collection is a close-up shot of vibrant oranges — and comments on the Chinese-American experience. The connections between the real-life release of “Bliss Montage” and the fictional collection in “Peking Duck,” along with other nuanced links between Ma’s stories and her personal background, provide a satisfying series of revelations for attentive readers.
In “Bliss Montage,” Ma proves herself as an esteemed voice of the 21st century. The collection is a poignant criticism of capitalism, racism, academia, gendered expectations, and the world’s response to climate change. It is an exemplary work of literature, composed with talent and purpose. The experience of reading Ma’s latest collection can best be described by a word taken straight from its title: bliss.

“Alive at the End of the World” is just that: alive. The latest poetry collection from award-winning memoirist, essayist, and poet Saeed Jones delivers on its titular promise of a living, breathing read in the face of grief, loss, and apocalypse. Jones uses this collection to explore the depths of his personal grief as well as the societal despair inflicted by white supremacy in the United States, not only as an outlet for his sorrow but as a voice for social change. Grim humor shakes up what would otherwise be a somber narrative, favoring a trend not towards fatalism, but rather a hope for a better future.
This collection features a cohesive blend of free verse poetry, prose, and narrative elements that speak both to his personal history and the history of Black oppression. When he asks himself, “Did I Just Trick Myself into Writing Another Memoir?,” the answer, unequivocally, is yes. Jones pries open the deepest recesses of his heart to give the reader a raw look at what and “who happened to him,” as he writes in “If You Had an Off Button, I’d Name You ‘Off,’” from his inexorable grief over the loss of his mother to his search for meaning in encounters with men to his early experiences with prejudice in a Texas classroom — and that’s exactly what makes this collection so wonderfully human.
At the same time, Jones provides an intertextual account of the effects of white supremacy, speaking from the perspective of and drawing from the lives of figures such as Luther Vandross, Little Richard, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, Maya Angelou, Billie Holiday, and more. Through these voices Jones finds a greater power to educate and vocalize a call for action; he is driven by history, and this momentum is felt in every word on every page.
The principal spark in this collection comes from a somewhat unconventional structure. From the very first page, Jones’s work oozes with poetic form; poetic devices such as meaningful repetition underscore even the table of contents, where duplicate titles “Okay, One More Story” create intrigue and emphasis before the poetic narrative even begins to unfold. Here, the cyclical nature of the work is revealed, as the reader is given a preview of the repeating pattern of “Alive at the End of the World,” “Grief,” and “Saeed, or The Other One” that begins and ends each section of the collection — a soothing yet foreboding rhythm that, like the narrative itself, does a fantastic job of evoking the cocktail of hope and dread that Jones breathes into his work.
He even hides poetry in the quote attributions found interspersed in the pages, indicating one quote in particular to be from “Saeed Jones, repeating a line from ‘1989’ by Alexander Chee.” Every nook, from cover to cover, is thus bursting with creative excellence; irregularity, in this case, compliments the apocalyptic subject matter.
Part of the vivacity of this collection sprouts from the uniquely transparent process that Jones employs. In “Saeed Wonders If the Poem You Just Read Would’ve Been Better Served by a Different Title,” the reader is provided an insight to the inner working of Jones’s poetic process. Similarly, at the end of the book, he provides a section entitled “Notes at the End of the World,” containing his inspirations and explanations for many of the poems. Some of these are presented in a cryptic manner, such as his note that “The Dead Dozens should be read while playing a game of Spades that ends in drunken laughter and an act of unspeakable violence,” adding another layer of poetic mystique, a poem in and of itself.
These descriptions can prove quite helpful in deciphering many of the more abstract poems in the collection, such as “The Essential American Worker,” for which Jones notes that “the white space in the poem is ghost text as opposed to blank space,” a necessary detail to fully comprehend the work as it’s presented. This seems to be the collection’s only downfall: It errs on the side of abundance, and at times explains itself too much.
Poetry is, like most art, subjective and interpreted differently from reader to reader. In Jones’s rigorous explanations of his poems and prose, a key aspect of the consumer experience is lost — readers are deprived of an ability to postulate for themselves. At times it feels like checking an answer key: What is the reader supposed to extract from this? What is the right way to consume this art? On the other hand, these explanations advance the author’s purpose: Without an explanation, the historical gravity of many of these poems might fall flat, and thus the excess of detail may be a necessary evil in this particular work.
“Alive at the End of the World” is as raw as it is masterful. Engrossing and beautifully brief, it can easily be consumed — and arguably is best consumed — in a single sitting, following Saeed Jones through his despair, hope, desperation, and connections from beginning to end. Emboldened by his sort of “open-source” construction of the collection, Jones reminds the world that its end takes many familiar forms; it can be mundane or cataclysmic, and it’s right around the corner.

Shirley L. Chen ’22 is telling a creative story grounded in complex history.
On Oct. 21 and 22, Chen’s senior thesis “Chinatown, My Chinatown” will come to life in two parts: first, a 25-minute "living museum" installation, followed by a 60-minute one-woman one-act show. Pursuing a joint concentration in History and Literature and Theater, Dance, and Media, Chen’s play follows four characters as they compete in the 1966 Miss Chinatown USA pageant.
Chen worked for nine months to develop these characters by doing both primary and secondary research, including archival work and collecting oral histories from real pageant contestants from the sixties. With a wealth of possibilities, why tell a story about pageants?
“I was thinking a lot about competition within marginalized communities,” Chen said. “If you're put in a room full of girls who fill the same boxed categories, how does that completely shatter your perception of yourself? And then how do you build that back up? And how do you love yourself and learn who you are within those categories and outside of them?”
Chen chose this creative format for her thesis to most effectively convey the messages of her project.
“There’s a link between history and theater making,” said Chen. “I think the most effective art is when you put yourself into an environment, and then build a world around it. That’s why it's this one-woman show format.”
Chen’s piece truly fell into place when she realized that her friend’s grandmother, Connie Young Yu, had an intimate connection with the topic. Connie’s father was the chairman of the Miss Chinatown pageant in the late 1960s, and she had saved a vast collection of newspaper articles, photos, and pageant programs from the time period that she was willing to share with Chen.
Through Connie’s connections, Chen was also able to approach members of the 1960s San Francisco Chinatown community with three simple questions: “What is the Miss Chinatown pageant? What was your involvement in it? And what were the sixties like for you as a Chinese American person?” These questions guided Chen, allowing her to eventually form the four distinct characters that she enacts in her one-woman show.
Chen’s characters do not reflect any specific, real-life individuals — instead, she created fictional amalgamations of various aspects of her own personality. In doing so, she asks, “If I put four versions of myself in a room in a competition, all of whom with different elements of my worst traits and my best traits, would they learn how to love each other?”
This play was not easy for Chen to perfect. She recalls grappling with never-ending questions: “How do I respect these real people? How do I honor them? How do I give voice to them without making them caricatures? Will they think that this is an accurate portrayal? Am I doing Chinatown justice? Will they like this?” Then, Chen asked, quieter, “Will they hate this?”
Part of the reason that the success of this project is so important to her is its various connections to and divergences from her own identity.
“My parents emigrated from mainland China, and I grew up speaking Mandarin,” Chen said. “And even though this Miss Chinatown story is a part of Asian American history, it's not a part of the history that my family is a part of, or the lineage that our family belongs to.” Despite this, Chen still feels profoundly connected to the story and its characters, saying, “I've always found it really hard to ask my parents or my grandparents about this time in their lives. So it's been really special to get to connect to people who are also grandparents but to learn about them as friends and see these parallels in our lives.”
In “Chinatown, My Chinatown,” Chen unpacks how contestants negotiated their own Chinese identity and femininity as they competed in pageants.
“I asked this to some of the former contestants and a lot of times they didn't have a clear answer: What does it mean to be Miss Chinatown? What makes you think that you could be Miss Chinatown? To me, this pageant was really a way of showing ‘we're soft, and we're feminine, and we're elegant’ while facing a wave of negative assumptions of Chinatown as a place for gang violence and gambling.”
Chen takes a nuanced approach to these complex issues of identity in her show.
“Competition and jealousy within a uniform community is often not talked about, just because people want to, rightfully so, project an image of happiness and togetherness and love and support.” Chen paused. “But sometimes that’s not the internal reality.”
After working on it for so long, Chen is excited to present her creative thesis. “It’s a slice of my brain and a slice of my biggest fears and dreams. I think that’s reason enough to see it.”

This article contains mentions of sexual assault that may be troubling to some readers.
The tone of Andrew Dominik’s film “Blonde” can be summarized in one scene: As Marilyn Monroe and her lovers (yes, lovers — she’s part of a throuple) look into the sky, romance and promise linger in the night air. The camera pans up as stars glimmer overhead… and then transform into sperm writhing across the screen.
Yes: This is a real scene that came from a 22-million-dollar, Ana de Armas-starring Netflix movie about Marilyn Monroe, with some of Hollywood's top names. And, yes: The rest of the film follows in this tonally confusing, strangely melodramatic, and slightly disturbing fashion.
“Blonde” has a premise destined to confuse viewers. Described as a “fictional portrait” by Netflix, it is based not upon Marilyn Monroe’s true life but instead the historical fiction novel “Blonde” by Joyce Carol Oates. Despite being mostly fictionalized, it seems to embrace the idea that it is finally getting to the bottom of Marilyn Monroe’s character. It therefore poses the risk of convincing audiences that the film is in some way a factual representation of Monroe’s life.
“Blonde” possesses amazingly inaccurate and strange plot developments. Marilyn is part of a throuple with a pair of men that call themselves the Gemini, giving the relationship an incestous subtext. She is obsessed with a picture of her father that her mother gave her and hallucinates it speaking to her throughout the film.
When the film doesn’t exactly fall flat due to its bizarre choices, it’s horrifically disturbing. Multiple vivid scenes of sexual violence occur throughout the film, which are made even more shocking since they are placed next to more upbeat scenes. These depictions of abuse are meant to show the source of Marilyn’s trauma, but they are gratuitous and don’t clearly connect with the problems that she faces. There are so many instances of physical and sexual abuse that they merge together in a deluge of horror; the film seemingly enjoys forcing the audience to languish through them. In each instance, Monroe is not only abused and humiliated but also reacts with complete passivity. Instead of giving Marilyn agency in her own film, Dominik portrays her as a clueless victim. She never fights back, and it is hinted that her abuse might even be in part due to her naiveté.
Apart from these scenes of abuse, there are also many unncessary sex scenes which, instead of showing Marilyn Monroe as her own person, continue to sexualize her. Ana de Armas is forced to unnecessarily parade around topless in multiple parts of the film and say “Daddy” uncomfortably often. These vapid scenes contribute to the impression that Dominik is no better than the producers that manipulated Monroe in the 1950s.
The strangest part of the film is Dominik’s fixation on Monroe’s relationship with motherhood. Throughout the film, she struggles both with the memories of her mother (who tried to kill her during her childhood in the film) and her own role as a maternal figure. Marilyn is scarred early in the film when she is pressured to have an abortion, and pregnancy and motherhood dominate her life until the end of the film. In one half-appalling, half-oddly-comedic scene, a CGI fetus hallucination chides Marilyn about her earlier abortion. This storyline suggests that instead of being a sex symbol, Marilyn’s true role was that of a mother. Instead of being able to become her own person, Marilyn is chained to two different forms of misogyny.
The film is confused in ways aside from storytelling. The aspect ratio flickers between 1:1, 1:37, 1:85, and 2:39 seemingly at random, with no consistent theme used to distinguish between them. The color grading also switches between black and white and full color. The cinematographer, Chayse Irvin, makes these shots look beautiful, but Dominik’s constant changes only serve to disorient the viewer.
The disastrous plot of “Blonde” is all the more disappointing due to the care that others put into it. Costume designer Jennifer Johnson did an incredible job of recreating Monroe’s iconic outfits. The film boasts impeccable recreations of 1950s interiors and film sets. And Ana de Armas is obviously trying to put her all into the role, with some amazing shows of both gentle fortitude and turbulent emotion. However, Monroe’s famous baby-doll voice is clearly challenging to imitate, and Armas struggles to hide her accent.
Overall, “Blonde” is a confused film built on rocky foundations, which is only redeemed in any way by its realistic costuming. It uses sexual abuse for shock value and suggests that Marilyn Monroe even deserved some of the harm that happened to her. She is already passive in so many ways, but the worst is the way she is chained to a destiny that either links her to the role as a sex object or a mother. Dominik had a chance to finally give Marilyn the piece that she deserves. However, the film conveys only one message: It is time to let Marilyn Monroe rest in peace, lest her legacy be abused by the film industry even more than it already has been.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What happens when a beacon of light dies? The Oprah Winfrey produced, Reginald Hudlin directed documentary “Sidney” suggests that it continues to shine on the people it has warmed. To many Black people, in the words of Morgan Freeman, Sidney Poitier was this “bright light,” and “no other beacon [was] as sure as that, [and] believed in as strongly as that.”
Poitier became one of the most bankable leading men and one of the only Black stars in early 1960s Hollywood, with a filmography including “In the Heat of the Night,” “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” and “A Raisin in the Sun,” among scores of others. Perhaps most notable is “Lilies of the Field,” for which he became the first Black man to win an Oscar.
Chronicling this extraordinary life, the new documentary aims to bring Sidney Poitier’s light back into focus following his 2022 death. Overall, the filmmakers deliver a solid picture that highlights the pride that Poitier gifted to Black people, but in giving thanks to this forefather, “Sidney” rebuffs the founding fathers of Black cinema.
Where recent documentaries on celebrities like Paul Newman or Jane Fonda have taken the route of angling the person’s life through a single lens, “Sidney” chooses to attack the behemoth of Poitier’s experiences from all angles, presumably with the aim of painting the clearest picture of the star’s existence within and outside of the American film landscape. “Sidney” takes viewers from Poitier’s joining the American Negro Theatre through his time as a beloved comedy director. The movie does not only silo his accomplishments to onscreen work, either. It ensures the audience knows Poitier’s deep familial values, originating from his parents and his Bahamian homeland, while also highlighting moments of transgression, particularly Poitier’s affair with actress Diahann Carroll.
By trying to touch on a bit of everything, however, the portrait painted in “Sidney” becomes muddled.
Jarring cuts and unexplored holes pock-mark a well-aiming documentary. Just as the audience starts to see Poitier’s affair with Carroll unfolding, understanding that this “near-perfect” figure might betray the morals that have themed the movie, the narrative cuts frustratingly to the March on Washington, and then just as quickly to “Lilies of the Field.” However, the pacing is among the least egregious issues of the film.
The documentary begins by painting a picture of Poitier’s life as a poor child in the Bahamas, sans electricity, sans education, but most importantly, according to Winfrey’s claims, sans racial bias. Poitier, even in his disadvantages and later descrimination, did not have the Black American affliction from birth. His upbringing in the more accepting community of the Bahamas meant that he did not struggle to recognize his innate humanity, as every Black person growing up in the U.S. must do. Winfrey says that “he wasn’t defined by his color, and he wasn’t saying that as resistance,” as if shouting that credo in defiance was not a necessity for some. Getting the chance not to be socially defined by race is a privilege ignored in the film, replaced by an attitude that praises this ideal thinking as the assumed default, which if one cannot embody, means a moral failure. At the time, most Black people in the U.S. could not think so idealistically, especially those giants of cinema who came before Poitier.
The methods “Sidney” chooses to employ to set Poitier apart from his predecessors delegitmize the contributions made by these actors. People like Mantan Moreland, Paul Robeson, and Hattie McDaniel — all Black actors in the studio system — forced their way into this white space. To do so, they unfortunately had to ingratiate themselves to a racist, white audience that only recognized them in sub-humanity.
While Morgan Freeman proudly claims that Sidney Poitier never took a role that forced him to “bug his eyes,” or “duck his head,” he suggests that the dehumanization of Black people on-screen is a choice made by these studio-age actors that Poitier was simply above. But these Black actors did not necessarily want to assume these tropes (Poitier’s personal view mentioned in the documentary is overpowered by the adoration of contemporary voices). They deserve the respect that should come with blazing a trail, especially given the fact that Hattie McDaniel, for example, was the first Black person ever to win an Oscar. The documentary chooses to subtly dismiss these older stars in favor of naming Poitier as the only forefather. Additionally, it makes the claim that Poitier’s ability to avoid playing racist characters comes from talent, bravery, and dignity, yes, but also the luck of ever being able to find one’s worth in a supposedly racially blind community before entering the jarring racism of the U.S..
Even in the documentary’s missteps, however, there are beacons of light. The choice of interviewees includes a smattering of massively acclaimed stars like Denzel Washington to activists like Andrew Young and even the documentary’s subject himself — a rare gem in expository documentary filmmaking. All these juggernauts feel the indelible effect of Poitier’s legacy and live by his example everyday in their careers. “Sidney” understands the expression of Black joy that comes from his presence.
Everyone from Spike Lee to Quincy Jones describes the vindication that Black folks felt sitting in the theater when Poitier in “In the Heat of the Night” slapped a white man. Viewers can see the happiness and a collective “fist pump” emanating from these titans of film as they recall the scene. Sidney Poitier stands alone in numerous ways and his legacy deserves and needs to be preserved, and this documentary is an adequate way of doing so. However, Poitier’s legacy exists so incredibly that bolstering it does not necessitate putting down his predecessors; it can stand proudly alone as he did not have to.

Rob Zombie’s new remake of “The Munsters” debuted on Sept. 27, surpassing expectations in a few key ways, while all other critical factors fell flat. This movie is Zombie’s first film reboot project since his “Halloween” and “Halloween II” reboot movies — both made over a decade ago to mixed reception — so his fans may not have had high hopes for this new attempt at reviving a past series. Ultimately, this version of “The Munsters” falls short in capturing what made the original show so engaging for audiences when it was first released in the 1960s and during the reruns that kept audiences captivated for decades.
But what made the original Munsters so beloved by audiences across such a long time? Simply put, “The Munsters” pushed the status quo of what a sitcom could depict. Before it aired, the idea of the classic American sitcom was one defined by shows like “I Love Lucy” and “Father Knows Best,” offering a look into idyllic American life accompanied by nuclear families, perfect suburban homes, and a life where your biggest problem was your neighbor who wouldn’t leave you alone. However, by the time this genre had been on the air for over a decade, many viewers desired something more than what the traditional sitcom had to offer, paving the way for shows that showcase more varied lifestyles such as “The Beverly Hillbillies,” “The Addams Family,” and, most importantly, “The Munsters.”
Zombie’s version of “The Munsters” primarily follows protagonist Lily Dracula (played by Zombie’s wife, Sheri Moon Zombie) as she searches for love with a fair amount of bumps in the road. However, Lily ultimately finds the love of her life in Herman Munster (Jeff Daniel Phillips), a Frankenstein-esque character created less than a week before he and Lily’s meeting. Fitting to the fast pace of this film, the couple head to the altar only a week after they meet, vowing to be there for each other until a “stake through the heart do them part.” The plot of this movie is all over the place, with Lily’s father, the one and only Count Dracula, driving most of the plot with his dislike of Herman at first glance. Eventually, the Count’s fears about Herman are validated, as Herman accidentally gives The Count’s mansion away to one of his ex-wives. With this new conflict for the family, they find themselves moving to a suburban neighborhood in Los Angeles known as Mockingbird Heights, where they begin to resent the fact that their new home is surrounded by people living such idyllic, perfect lives.
“The Munsters” exceeds expectations in one key area: the attention to detail in both the set and costume design. From the comically decrepit suburban home that the family relocates to, to the club-like hideouts that many of the protagonists frequent back in their homeland of Transylvania, the film is quite visually pleasing. The exaggerated transitions that frequently drip, ooze, or flash only add to the visual flare of the film, drawing audiences in and making the hastily paced film feel more tolerable. Not once will viewers find themselves thinking that this movie is corny for cheap-looking costumes that look pulled from Party City because the costumes — like the rest of the visuals — look professionally made.
Perhaps the most major of this film’s shortcomings is the way that Zombie approaches comedy in the film. The first twenty minutes of this movie are dense with surface-level dialogue that tries and fails to entertain with a combination of a dad-humor and zany children’s show jokes. This movie tries to embrace corniness at times but falls short of humor or wit in a way that feels out of touch. For example, near the beginning of the movie, audiences see one of the creators of Herman Munster tell his co-creator that “he is simply dropping ice cold facts,” a line that feels both unnecessary and out of place. Still, there are redeeming qualities to the film’s humor, such as Herman’s cringey yet charming stand-up-comedy style one-liners (“A horse walks into the bar, the bartender says, ‘Why the long face?’”) Because of this strange combination of humor and style that guides the entire movie, audiences may wonder what demographic it is supposed to appeal to.
Ultimately, Zombie’s take on the “Munsters” story does not succeed as a reboot due to the fact that it is missing key concepts that made the original “Munsters” shine. Zombie’s version neglects the original series’ core themes of accepting others because of their differences and finding identity in a world where you are alone, which the classic captured so well.

Alvvays first enraptured listeners with their 2014 breakout hit, “Archie, Marry Me.” With fuzzy, distorted guitars juxtaposed with a sugary, catchy melody, the elation and heartbreak of being young and in love especially resonated with fans. Ever since then, they have amassed a cult following, all eager to pick apart every song in their discography and hungry for more. Thus, it is no surprise that the announcement of their new album was met with much anticipation.
After a five-year hiatus, Alvvays has returned. And, they sound better than ever. “Blue Rev,” the band’s latest album released on Oct. 7, perfects the unique brand of shoegazey indie pop Alvvays has held tightly to over the course of their discography. The album, “Blue Rev,” named after an alcoholic soda drink lead singer Molly Rankin and keys player Kerri Maclellan would drink as teenagers, reflects the sleek, fizzy, and delightful songs on the album. Throughout the album, Alvvays displays their growth as a band and their penchant for power pop. With each song, they master the perfect, larger-than-life hook, drop the percussion in at the right time, make magnificent key changes, and distort the guitar just enough for the song to melt into a fuzzy, lovesick haze.
The lead single, “Pharmacist,” is a mission statement for the album. In the song, Rankin describes that awkward and melodramatic feeling of seeing an ex in simple terms, “I know you’re back / I saw your sister at the pharmacy picking up / Said you have that new love glow.” When Rankin sings “pharmacy,” the distorted, fuzzy guitars come crashing in, giving the lyrics that much more emotional weight and gut-wrenching emotion. As the guitars swirl around Rankin’s sweet vocals, the percussion, reverb, and background vocals kick in to perfection. The song ends in a daze of guitar, with Alvvays’s guitarist O’Hanley shredding the song into oblivion.
Alvvays are transparent with their inspirations. In an interview with Stereogum, Rankin cites Sonic Youth, The Smiths, Yo La Tengo, and Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go’s as major influences of “Blue Rev” and their music in general. These influences come across subtly in “Blue Rev.” Sonic Youth and Yo La Tengo’s rock experimentation is heard in “Blue Rev”’s interesting guitar solos, motifs, and distortion. Their past work has been inspired by the Jesus and Mary Chain. Clearly, shoegaze and rock have major impact on their musical vision. However, they also respect a good pop hook, and this comes across in the song “Belinda Says.”
Making direct reference to Carlisle’s massive hit, “Heaven Is a Place On Earth,” Rankin describes a character using the radio to escape a difficult romantic situation. “Belinda says that heaven is a place on Earth / Well, so is hell,” Rankin sings, with a belt that imbues heartbreak and escapism to the song. And, with a winking nod to Carlisle’s song, Rankin shifts key at the end of the song also, making for an anthemic end to the emotional centerpiece to “Blue Rev.”
In other parts of the album, Alvvays’s dedication to the production is made very apparent. Each song has its own beautifully catchy hook, the percussion always comes in at the perfect time, the reverb gives each song the right amount of space and atmosphere, the guitar grounds the songs in a haze of noise, and the key changes are timed perfectly. “Pressed” ebbs between a saddening minor key, and a bittersweet major key, “Easy On Your Own?” has showstopping percussion, and “Velveteen” has Rankin reach a falsetto belt unheard before. The lyrics also show maturity, with Rankin exploring the usual topics of heartbreak and Bildungsroman ache, but also exploring humor and funny characters, as proved by the song “Very Online Guy.”
Alvvays’s new album displays all of the bands’ best traits, while also extending and perfecting their production, lyrics, and songwriting. “Blue Rev,” showcases Alvvays as a pioneer of power pop and shoegaze revival through and through. Each song is perfect music festival material, but at the same time the confessional and relatable lyrics make the songs intimate. Alvvays makes the contradictory work: rock yet pop, large yet intimate, sad yet sweet. “Blue Rev” proves that Alvvays is at the forefront of what music can and should be.

“I feel like she’s gonna cast a witchy spell on us,” said one concertgoer as the crowd awaited the arrival of rock ‘n roll legend Stevie Nicks at Sound on Sound Music Festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut.
Needless to say, expectations were high. After a long day of artist performances, the crowd awaited the headlining act to close out the first-time festival’s inaugural day of programming. A tall order in itself, the task’s difficulty was compounded by the nature of the performer herself: recognized by Rolling Stone as one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time and one of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, Nicks’s reputation preceded her.
In all respects, Nicks delivered. Though she is often affectionately considered a representative of all things mystical — witches, crystals, spells, tarot, what have you — unfortunately no spells were cast this night. The experience, itself, however, was quite magical. Nicks’s iconic voice, classic repertoire, strong band backing, and overall charming disposition joined to create something greater than a sum of its parts — a timeless celebration of music, rock n’ roll, Nicks herself, and just good plain fun.
The set began on a more subdued, moody note with Nicks singing her first two songs — “Outside the Rain” and “Dreams” — with no visuals on the screen and little going on behind her on stage. Immediately, then, all of the focus fell on Nicks, the sole spotlight illuminating her long, crimped hair; classic black, flowy outfit; and the sparkling streamers dangling from her microphone stand.
After saying a few introductory words, the energy then quickly began to grow. “If Anyone Falls” onward, Nicks was joined by two backing vocalists, various graphics on the big screen, and a synchrony of lights. Nicks also delivered a diverse setlist, with a healthy mix of tracks from her solo ventures like “Enchanted” and “Bella Donna” but also Fleetwood Mac favorites and covers like “For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield.
Vocally, Nicks probably could have satisfied the crowd with a less-than-great performance, skating by on reputation and nostalgia alone. Factor in her age (Nicks turned 74 this year), and it would not have been surprising if she had opted for a “let’s-just-all-have-a-good-time” show rather than focusing too much on executing robust vocals.
But she didn’t. Instead, the singer was, all things considered, a powerhouse. Sure, she made some vocal concessions on certain songs, but this was to be expected, both because many of these tracks were originally recorded nearly fifty years ago, and because Nicks has been making these adjustments for years (some can already be heard on Fleetwood Mac’s 1997 Live Recorded album “The Dance”).
And where she saved energy on the high notes, she then used it elsewhere. Aside from her still-powerful signature vocal tone, Nicks created an atmosphere of collective fun and familiarity by simply letting her charm and humility come through. She spoke to the crowd as if to her friends, not only sharing anecdotes about song origins but also speaking about her own self-doubts with a refreshing sense of honesty and informality. At various points throughout the night, she discussed her experiences and struggles with growing older, taking care of her voice, and also with dealing with times when she is not feeling her best mentally: that is, she moves her mattress to the floor. Clearly as lovably eccentric as ever, Nicks also spent the night accompanying her songs with a variety of hand motions, spins, and poses — all of which the crowd absolutely loved and received with whoops of encouragement every time.
This is not to say that Nicks insisted on keeping the spotlight on herself the entire time. Several of Fleetwood Mac’s as well as her own tracks are known to feature a robust instrumental accompaniment, and these were especially showcased live. The drummer and both guitarists were a sight (and a sound) to behold as they carried the integral components of Nicks’s songs through the night with ease, but also shone in solos of their own. In extended plays such as a 10-minute version of “Gold Dust Woman” or a lengthened intro to “Edge of Seventeen,” Nicks’s longtime lead guitarist Waddy Wachtel in particular capitalized on this room to play, jamming out on complex riffs and creating a palpable energetic build-up.
Above all, the night was marked by an unmistakable sense of gravity, a recognition of the timelessness of the figure on stage. Nicks commanded the festival, demonstrating why she, her voice, and her songs remain just as beloved today as they were in the early stages of her career in the ’80s. One needed to have only witnessed the enraptured silence that fell upon the crowd during the beginning guitar melody of “Landslide” to know that Nicks’s appeal has not waned; in fact, time has only seemed to increase her status within the world of music to that of near canonization. Nicks, herself, seems to be a lifelong performer: If she was tired of singing her songs for what must have been the millionth time, she did not show it. And as long as Nicks is able and willing to continue to perform, it seems that there will be demand for it. It is perhaps the sentiment of the set’s final song, “Rhiannon,” that provides the most effective summary of the evening: Stevie Nicks truly does ring like a bell through the night — and we really do love to love her.

Since the release of his first mixtape in 2011, “King Remembered Underground Tape 1991–1995,” Florida-native and rapper Denzel Curry has been constantly reinventing himself and his musical direction — a side effect of delivering project after project over the years. With the release of his second studio album “Melt My Eyez, See Your Future” in 2022, Curry told the Miami New Times that he is out with the old and in with the new: “Y'all are not going to hear the same type of Denzel anymore." Perhaps the end of an entire era in his career, the rapper wrapped up his 2022 tour with a legendary — one could even call it an “Ultimate” — show at Boston’s Roadrunner.
The intense energy coursing through the venue was palpable before Curry even took the stage. Opener PlayThatBoiZay made sure of that by delivering a performance so hype that multiple mosh pits erupted throughout his set. The undying screams from the moshers were loud enough to elicit a wild appearance by none other than Curry himself. He skirted across the stage with a knowing smirk that foreshadowed a great show was bound to come. PlayThatBoiZay was followed up by two other openers, AG Club and redveil, who brought their own finesse to their performances but matched Curry’s energy to a T.
Curry didn’t let his opening acts outshine him. On the contrary, they enhanced his performance by getting the crowd loose and rowdy so that his performance could feed and thrive off that wild energy. He kicked off the show with “Melt Session #1” and “Walkin,” which echo each other in the vulnerable and emotional narrative behind the lyrics “I keep walkin’” that are featured on both tracks. Although the two are thematically coherent, the sonics could not be more different. While “Melt Session #1” features Robert Glasper’s introspective piano in the background, the trap beats on “Walkin” are catalysts for head-banging — especially when Boston fans heard the lyrics “make the team green like the Celtics.” When followed up with the political “Worst Comes to Worst” and “The Last”’s commentary on institutional racism released during the Black Lives Matter movement, the beginning of the setlist was a constant ebb and flow between lyrical and sonic contrasts.
The driving force behind the narratives in Curry’s verses was the thematic display on the screen behind him. Just like Curry’s performance, there was never an underwhelming moment. Whether it was the trippy flash of hallucinogenic colors, the striking red ink of Japanese imperial-era courts, the sweltering yellows of a desert, grainy footage of sumo wrestlers going at it, or the shocking white faces of creepy clowns, the stage was always dynamic. Both the thrum of the bass and the buzz of electric colors charged the room and worked to energize the crowd.
Quite the multitasker, Curry was also a master at engaging the audience in his show. He painstakingly taught the Boston crowd how to make a wall-of-death in preparation of the beat drop in “Ain’t No Way.” He didn’t stop there. As if getting the entire standing area to part down the middle wasn’t impressive enough, Curry got the entire venue to get low before the opening beats of “Ultimate.” He also went above and beyond to get the moshers-going during “Dog Food” but made sure to help people up-front out with shouts of warning telling everyone to “step the fuck back!” When the crowd got too rowdy he didn’t panic: “Let me see that shoe,” he said after a shoe was thrown at him from an over enthusiastic fan. “Fuck that shoe!” he yelled and chucked it back into the laughing crowd.
Curry also conversed with the audience on more serious topics, like how any day could be the last in the post-pandemic reality before he performed “The Last.” As a result of his commitment to making the night one to remember for the fans, the recently opened Roadrunner came to life and genuinely felt like the largest indoor general admission venue in New England.
After more than a decade in the industry, Denzel Curry’s growth is evident. Not only in the evolution of his musical style, but in the impressive stage presence and larger than life personality on stage.

Braving the torrential downpour, fans lined up around the block of Boston’s newest venue Roadrunner to see Japanese sensation Joji take the stage. Despite the horrendous weather, the show’s sold-out crowd was punctual, and Joji’s hypeman SavageRealm noted that he didn’t see “one empty seat.” As the show neared its start, fans chanted “Filthy Frank,” an homage to the artist’s popular YouTube channel from the early 2010s.
After a brief silence, the piano introduction to “Sanctuary” boomed over the sound system, and Joji started his set. Immediately, his smooth, mumbling vocals filled up the room and reverberated thanks to the acoustics of the venue. Thanks to its upbeat tone and quick tempo, “Sanctuary” filled the crowd with a high energy and got fans hyped for the set.
Greeting the audience, Joji then announced that he was going to play one of his older SoundCloud songs, “YEAH RIGHT.” The screens behind him showed footage of his early career on grainy film, eliciting feelings of nostalgia and gratitude for how far he’s come. The slow, sad vibe contrasted heavily with the tempo of “Sanctuary,” demonstrating the variety within his discography which ultimately makes concerts entertaining.
The set design was unassuming, featuring a raised platform and LED screens. Given the slow, introspective nature of his discography, the simple stage fixtures blended well with the sonic texture of his music. The lighting, as well, contributed to an overall feeling of warmth. Rather than utilize Roadrunner’s impressive lighting system, Joji’s team relied mostly on LED backlighting, which casted his silhouette into the audience. Between songs, the lighting changed so that he could be clearly seen in his black overalls, but he was often no more than a vignette during his tracks.
Additionally, it should be noted that his stage band was truly impressive, and Joji gave them space to shine. On “CAN’T GET OVER YOU,” pianist Isaac Sleator, known as “Gator,” performed an improvised soul solo and brought new depth to the song, which was originally featured in the 2018 album “Ballads 1.” Similarly, guitar player Joshua Snow rounded out the band’s texture with a silky electric guitar sound, especially during his solo on Joji’s newest release, “YUKON (INTERLUDE).”
Not only was Joji’s stage presence confident, but he also brought a goofy energy to the room, perhaps emulating his earlier days as Filthy Frank. He fired a t-shirt cannon, brought a local Elvis impersonator out on stage, and performed a vulgar, yet comedic freestyle. Furthermore, frequent joking with his hype man on stage reinforced the low-key vibes of the performance; Joji truly was there to have fun.
This being said, the singer’s energy while performing was underwhelming. While his discography is surely slower and sadder, he did little more than stand in place and sway a bit while performing. Only at the end of the set did he utilize all the space on stage and approach the audience. His laid-back energy contributed to an informal relationship between artist and audience, but it also detracted from the energy one might want when purchasing an expensive concert ticket.
Regardless, Joji’s artistry was undeniable, and no other moment demonstrated this more than the a-capella rendition of his most-streamed song, “SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK.” Whereas his mumbled vocals were overshadowed at times during his set, there was nothing between his voice and the audience during this moment, allowing himself to fully exhibit his vocal prowess. Complemented by the slow piano in the background, Joji took his time during the verses, only continuing when he felt he was ready. When the chorus arrived, he let loose and perfectly held his sustained notes, bringing chills to the audience, who were singing along in unison. This moment of the show — not only memorable— redeemed any hesitations previously held and demonstrated why Joji sold out the largest GA venue in New England.
Before the audience could even stop applauding “SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK,” Joji returned to the stage to perform his recent chart-topping single “Glimpse of Us” as his encore. Again, the combination of piano and longing vocals flooded the audience with a sentimental wave. Although a song about loss, “Glimpse of Us” brought a fulfilling closure to the evening and hinted at the quality of his upcoming album “Smithereens,” which is set to be released on Nov. 4. If the rest of the album is of the caliber of “Glimpse of Us,” it would be surprising if his next tour was not sold out as well.

“Hello?” an unearthly voice echoed around TD Garden last Tuesday, Oct. 11, mere seconds before Gorillaz appeared on stage. “Is anyone there?”

The stage, adorned with sparkly gold panels to commemorate the band’s newest single, “New Gold,” shimmered under dim lights as the word “HELLO” flashed on the giant screen. As the voice reached a crescendo of repetition, green lights started to illuminate the stage and the band jumped into the lively fan-favorite “M1A1.” The answer to “Hello?” was clear: Gorillaz had arrived, loud and singular as ever.
Gorillaz is a British virtual band originally created by singer/songwriter Damon Albarn — also known for his former band Blur — and artist Jamie Hewlett. Its four “members” include 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs. These members are completely fictional, and the music is entirely Albarn’s work. The band is known for including a wide variety of genres and features, giving it a collaborative and modern feel.


Translating the concept of a virtual band into an engaging live performance can be challenging. The band has used a variety of strategies to aid their past shows, including holograms. However, on their latest tour Gorillaz have embraced their humanity. Damon Albarn headed the performance with about a dozen supporting musicians, including Seye Adelekan on bass and a back-up chorus starring Michelle Ndegwa.

Albarn used his physical presence with intention. He was very active with the crowd, parading through the middle of the pit, grabbing delighted fans by the arms, and briefly donning one crowd member’s hat. He brought a wild energy, flailing his arms and sticking out his tongue often. This was especially highlighted in “Last Living Souls” and “Rhinestone Eyes,” where Albarn hyped up the crowd during choruses.

Meanwhile, the backup band bounced happily to the groovy beats and the backdrop of glowing visuals. The primary visuals used were the band’s music videos and official visualizers. These videos were fully animated, portraying the virtual members. Albarn and 2-D (the virtual lead singer) sang in-sync, suggesting that the set list is carefully rehearsed to line up with the visuals.
image id=1358543 align=center size=large caption=true
Although Albarn and the crew brought considerable energy to the performance, the visuals were strangely repetitive. Considering that the band has virtual members, the use of a concert venue’s screens is key. However, the visuals were pulled from previous music videos. Although they were beautifully animated, it did disappoint those searching for live original content.

Just as Gorillaz is known to genre-jump, the tone of the concert switched often. The setlist swung between high-energy songs and slower tracks, with Albarn showcasing both his skill to hype up a crowd and croon on the melodica. One especially quick energy shift occurred between “Opium” with openers EARTHGANG to “Desolé” with Fatoumata Diawara. EARTHGANG, a rap duet from Atlanta, ran on stage during “Opium,” their intensity shining like diamonds and constellations in a rainbow of color. Diawara slowed down the tempo during “Desolé,” grooving alongside Albarn as a calmer scene — animated ocean waves and a boat — were projected on the screen. In both cases, Albarn used the features as a chance to step back and showcase the talent of his guests, often gesturing proudly to his fellow artists.
These shifts in energy were key to creating a collaborative feeling to the concert. They were also accentuated by the inclusion of about half a dozen featured singers. Many people came and went onstage, backing up Albarn and sometimes taking over the song entirely, including Bootie Brown, Sweetie Irie, Rebecca Freckleton, Petra Luke, and members of De La Soul. The entrances of these artists, alongside those previously mentioned, kept the show lively. The chemistry between the various features was fun and invited the audience to sing along as if they were also part of the larger Gorillaz family. This energy reached a climax in the high-energy remix version of “Clint Eastwood” with Sweetie Irie, in which many different singers came together on stage to sing the ultimate song of the performance.
Overall, Gorillaz was able to deliver a unique collaborative performance — an attestation to the experience that Albarn has gained in live performance in the 24 years since the band was first formed. They managed to perform live fantastically despite being a digital band and showcased a variety of styles while maintaining a consistent energy. As a result, Gorillaz remain as they should be: perfectly singular and strange.

Johnny Venus and Doctur Dot were beamed up to the stage in a flash of white light as “GHETTO GODS” began to play.
Doctur Dot, also know as WowGr8, belted his verses out with passion.
Johnny Venus kept the crowd engaged with some call-and-response action during “Proud of U.”
They performed crowd-favorites like “Down Bad,” on which they collaborated with Dreamville label-mates like J. Cole.
Other songs in their set included “UP,” “Bank,” and “BILLI.”
Johnny Venus received much love from the crowd. One enamored concert-goer could even be heard screaming “He’s so handsome!”
EarthGang’s effective stage design bathed them in a fresh light.
Their love for Boston was reciprocated by the fans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a fine line between watching and watching out for. With the increasing deployment of surveillance technology to monitor student protest, dozens of universities now find themselves on the wrong side of that line.
At least 37 universities have been confirmed as clients of Social Sentinel (also known by its new, rebrand-attempting name, Navigate 360), a technology monitoring company that tracks students’ social media behavior with the stated intention of identifying risks of self-harm or violence on campuses and alerting administrators.
The purported goal is admirable. Yet the chosen method — invasive, sweeping surveillance — is entirely inappropriate for the problem at hand. Worse still, the institutions using the service do not seem exclusively concerned with improving mental health. Sentinel’s services have, in fact, reportedly been deployed in far more nefarious contexts, following buzzwords like “protest” on social media and even scavenging one student’s social media posts after she alleged that administrators at North Carolina A&T mishandled her rape allegation.
Universities seem to be using Social Sentinel whenever surveillance might make their lives easier, even if doing so makes students’ lives worse. Meanwhile, many affected students aren’t even aware that such surveillance is occurring. Social Sentinel’s clients have taken an underhanded approach, making changes that deeply affect students’ privacy without having an honest discussion about why.
Mental health is a clear and pressing concern on college campuses; it’s one that demands administrative attention. But Big Brother-esque surveillance is hardly the solution administrators should turn to. An approach grounded in mass data gathering comes off as ineffective support at best and an insensitive justification for invading students’ privacy at worst. In particular, surveillance-centric approaches suggest that universities are more concerned with their liability in mental health-related incidents than with the actual well-being of their students. Rather than focusing on humanist approaches to rehabilitate struggling students, they have resorted to strategies that can act only as a band-aid.
We can even more comfortably condemn the application of this tool as a means to manage student protest. Social Sentinel’s creators not only knew their services were being used to track student protests; they also, on occasion, encouraged universities to use the surveillance tool in this way. Student protests have historically played a significant role in ensuring that administrations are held accountable — treating these vital elements of democratic participation with tactics reminiscent of authoritarian regimes is, to put it bluntly, not a good look for American universities.
As advances in artificial intelligence make the management of big data even easier, the tools of surveillance will become accessible to even smaller institutions. What was once the province of governments and dictators will become available to every overzealous administrator who wants to indulge in the folly of technological solutionism when presented with thorny, inconvenient problems. Mental health and violence on college campuses are immensely complex issues. They cannot be solved by simply collecting more data, developing more programs, or pushing more buttons. Oversimplifying such issues is both ineffective — the causes of the issues remain wholly unaddressed — and dangerous, as evidenced by the lack of regulation that such illusive solutionism invites.
While we maintain that AI-driven surveillance is problematic, elements of this new approach are here to say. That means that our centers of knowledge production must devote resources to studying the consequences; we maintain that Harvard should create an AI ethics institute. When such surveillance inevitably exceeds its stated goals — when watchful eyes are turned toward protest, or free association, or reproductive healthcare — we must have clear ethical guidance and policies for how to push back.
This responsibility certainly falls in large part on universities, but it also falls on all of us as students. We ought to make clear — through protests and editorials and advocacy — that we won’t go along to get along.
A line has been crossed; universities must take a step back and reassess how far past students’ comfort they will go in the name of ostensibly supporting these very same students. For our part, keeping a critical eye on surveillance is a good place to start. It’s time to watch the watchers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m balancing my phone on a stack of assorted items so I can get my key in the lock when my mom, watching the ordeal over FaceTime, comments on the large Palestinian flag donning my door. She hesitantly says it looks beautiful. She then proceeds to tell me stories of minority students murdered on their own college campuses for their views.
I know she wants me to take down the flag and keep my mouth shut. I’ve been cautious thus far to not flash it in the camera frame when I call her.
I think sometimes she forgets that I choose to wear a hijab every day. I have been wearing the hijab, a head covering worn by Muslim women and a symbol of modesty and religious commitment, for more than 10 years now. It is one of the most important parts of my identity.
It is also impossible to miss.
It’s hard to think of a more glaring visual indicator of being Muslim. If there is ever any Islamophobia around, I am its obvious walking target. There is no more blatant evidence of my beliefs than my hijab — and I could not be more proud of my continual choice, morning after morning, to put it on.
I am used to the questions tied to my choice. I grew up in the South, where I was no stranger to the well-meaning “Aren’t you hot in that?” and “If your parents are making you wear it, you can take it off while they’re not here.”
I’m lucky that these comments have never fazed me, and I know exactly why: My hijab has always been my choice. It is hard to convey the gravity of privilege that allows me to say that. I live in a country that has never, at least legally, asked me to take it off — see: France’s anti-separatism bill banning students from wearing hijab. Conversely, the U.S. has also never asked me to put it on — see: Iran’s hijab laws and morality police, under which, most recently, Mahsa Amini was detained and died in custody.
Amini’s death has sparked global outrage over the past month, from women burning their headscarves during feverish protests in Iran, to women an ocean away in Boston, cutting their hair on the Harvard Bridge in a show of solidarity. Western government officials have released statements and sanctions. Amini’s death and the resulting outrage have flooded all kinds of media outlets, from our personal social media feeds to global newspapers.
I find it incredibly inspiring to see the outpouring of support against this clear transgression of rights. I was personally touched by the number of peers that I saw being so vocal on the issue on social media and beyond.
That is, until I came across some of them sharing the hashtag #freedomfromhijab. Statements like these are counterintuitive. What are we truly fighting against — the hijab, or restrictions on one’s right to choose?
Amini’s death was not due to the hijab, but the lack of autonomy over her own body under the hijab law that led to her detainment — a theme we are all too familiar with. Amini’s death is a symptom of the same problem that plagues India, where women in some states are barred from their choice to actively wear that same hijab, or America, where vital abortion rights are being relentlessly curtailed.
I laud my peers at the Harvard protest in support of Iranian women who emphasized the true meaning of their protest. Signs that read “The problem is not the hijab, the problem is controlling women,” and statements like “I really want people to see that this is not an issue of Islam — this is not the religion that they portray it to be — and I think that is such a common misconception that people in the West are still battling today” — these should be the real focus of the movement.
Protests can look very different in different parts of the world. For many Iranian women, protest has involved their choice to take off the hijab. In the West, it can be the exact opposite.
I believe myself to be in a constant state of protest. The minute I step out of my room wearing my hijab, I am shouting my beliefs out to the world. Despite the skeptical glances and occasional temptations, my desire to feel spiritually connected through my hijab is enough to spur me on against its potential dangers.
Whatever form of protest we take up, there will always be some risk. It is when our desire to preserve our beliefs and rights is strong enough that we willingly take on that risk, that it becomes a testament to our commitment to who we are. I will keep my flag on my door as long as I believe in the cause, just as I keep my scarf wrapped around my head and heart.

I was 19 when I finally watched the four “The Hunger Games” films properly. I’d actually seen the last two when they came out in theaters, in 2014 and 2015, because my middle school friends had dragged me with them. On both occasions, I rolled my eyes the whole time, determined not to like even a shred of the movies playing in front of me. Afterward, I made sure to complain as much as I could. I picked holes in the plot. I criticized the premise as ridiculous. And I implied, many times, that liking the franchise made you stupid and immature.
Five years later, stuck at home at the height of the pandemic, I came across the films again. I was about a year into college at this point, and although I’d never so much as touched the books, I saw the movies on my Netflix home screen and thought they might be a good way to kill a couple of boring nights.
As I sat down to watch the tetralogy in its entirety, I couldn’t help but get deeply immersed. The action and fight sequences were gripping, and I thought the acting was phenomenal (maybe except in the case of Liam Hemsworth). Instead of being woven under seven layers of obscure metaphor, the social commentary was simple, clear, and accessible. The films were also, crucially, entertaining — something that I feel is always valuable. (After all, art cannot be successful, or “good,” if no one is consuming it in the first place.)
But more than that, the central politics of the series drew me in. The moments of conflict between the populace and the government reminded me of real, brutal struggles of revolution and independence that had actually occurred throughout human history – struggles that I’d learned about in my college classes. I found myself genuinely moved as I watched the protagonists battle insurmountable cruelty again and again.
And I realized, with a mixture of embarrassment, surprise, and regret, that “The Hunger Games” film series is actually quite good.
In some ways, this article is a confession. It’s also an attempt to atone for more than five years of hating on perfectly good films without even taking the time to approach them with an open mind.
Then again, perhaps I shouldn’t blame myself entirely for the way I acted when I was 14. Because amid a whole lot of middle school insecurity (which made me want to criticize anything that was popular), I also remember feeling like I had to mock “The Hunger Games”; after all, the whole world was doing it. It was a Young Adult franchise, and anyone “cultured” was supposed to hate YA. And even worse, it was popular YA for girls – something that society told me was unacceptable.
No one likes to be reminded of who they were as a teenager, or worse, as a pre-teen. We all had questionable taste in everything, whether it was fashion, music, books, or film. (I personally had a phase where I was obsessed with wearing a loose tie over a white blouse after I saw Clara do it one time on Doctor Who. My mother firmly vetoed the outfit until the phase wore off.) The point is, of course, that the things we enjoy at a young age are often embarrassing.
But young girls – and specifically what they like – consistently get the worst, and most enduring, social condemnation. And it wasn’t until I was older, and much more learned in feminism and social theory, that I was able to realize I had been both a victim and perpetrator of this condemnation.
Hating what teenage girls love is not a new thing by any means. But I remember it being particularly bad when I was a teenage girl myself. “The Hunger Games” is just one example of that time — allow me to direct your mind back to the height of John Green’s “The Fault in Our Stars,” or the release of Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe.” Predictably, I was a staunch critic of both of those things. Not because I actually had problems with them from an artistic standpoint, but because I knew that anything liked by other teenage girls must be awful.
Now that I’m an adult, I’m trying to actively relearn all of that. It hasn’t been easy, but it’s certainly been eye-opening.
I’ve been coming back to not just “The Hunger Games,” but to all the other stuff that I was too afraid to embrace as a teenage girl. And I’ve been discovering that I missed out on a lot of good experiences — one might even say good art.
So I guess, in the end, this piece is not about atonement at all. It’s about anger and grief. And also celebration. Because I’m sick of pretending I don’t love “The Hunger Games”; I’m tired of actively hiding what brings me happiness.
Giving myself permission to be honest in my enjoyment of things was not only one of the most liberating choices I ever made, but also one of the most mature ones. And as I proceed with my last year of college, I’m determined to revisit a whole host of other missed experiences.
Reclaiming my teenage years has never felt better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Right to Life, a campus organization against abortion, hosted a speaker event with Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins Thursday evening.
Around 50 people attended the event and a subsequent Q&A session, which was hosted in Harvard Hall as part of Hawkins’ 2022 campus speaking tour, called “Make Abortion Illegal Again.” The two-month tour spans eight campuses, including Ohio State University, Clemson University, and Yale.
Protesters in support of abortion rights did not attend the event. Hawkins said in an interview after her talk that she increased her security due to social media posts suggesting student protest. She said she was “disappointed” by the lack of attendance from those opposed to her views.
“That’s where you actually get a lot of change at that point, when you start having folks who have different opinions, learn what each other actually believes, and stop talking over each other or shouting,” Hawkins said.
Ava K. Pallotta ’25 — who organized a rally in support of abortion rights in May following the leaked Roe opinion — said she did not know about the Right to Life event and would have planned a protest otherwise.
“I would have wanted to counter protest to try to make sure that people who are pro-choice on this campus felt seen and supported,” Pallotta said. “There is a group on campus that does not support Kristan Hawkins and Harvard Right to Life and their beliefs.”
During the event, Hawkins discussed her anti-abortion beliefs and described the procedure as the “direct and intentional killing of a pre-born child.”
“When I say ‘make abortion illegal again,’ I’m speaking out of a place of true concern. Concern for the pre-born child who was violently killed in a direct abortion, as well as for her mother or his mother, who is paternalistically told that her empowerment and future success relies upon her willingness to subjugate another human being,” Hawkins said.
Hawkins’ tour comes in the wake of the Supreme Court’s landmark decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June, which eliminated the federal constitutional right to abortion. Less than four months after the decision, 13 states have banned most abortions.
Even so, Hawkins said striking down Roe “wasn’t a total victory” for the movement against abortion because the Supreme Court only returned the issue to the states.
“We would like to see the Supreme Court uphold laws that outlaw abortion. We can’t wait to get to a point where we have a federal protection measure in place, a ‘Life at Conception Act’, then moving on to a federal amendment to our Constitution,” Hawkins said. “That’s been our mission from the beginning.”
Meanwhile, Pallotta said she hopes pro-abortion rights activism goes beyond merely reacting to the anti-abortion movement.
“For me, it feels much more about, ‘What can I do to help make people feel seen and help protect abortion access?’ and less about, ‘What are pro-lifers doing and how can I counter that?’” she said.

U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel A. Cardona spoke about pandemic recovery and federal investment in education at a Harvard Graduate School of Education conference Friday.
Throughout the event, Cardona discussed post-Covid-19 educational recovery, teacher shortages, and suggestions for the use of pandemic-era government funding.
HGSE Dean Bridget T. Long introduced Cardona as “a local leader with a global vision.” Long praised Cardona’s tenure as commissioner of the Connecticut State Department of Education, during which he oversaw the state’s transition to remote learning and subsequent efforts to safely reopen schools.
In opening his remarks, Cardona said one of his “greatest fears” in his role as Education secretary is the American education system returning to its pre-pandemic state.
“That didn't work for too many students,” he said. “We've normalized disparities in opportunities and outcomes as a country. Returning to the same system would be failing our students.”
During his discussion, Cardona attributed recent teacher shortages to a lack of respect for the teaching profession.
“We talk a lot about teacher shortages. Teacher shortages are a symptom of a teacher respect issue,” Cardona said.
He added that the “ABCs of education”— agency, better working conditions, and competitive salaries — can help make the profession more desirable.
Cardona said school districts should prioritize using recent government funding to improve access to mental health services, connect with higher education and workforce partners, and develop a strong instructional core.
“The question is, do we have the will to match the unprecedented resources with unprecedented urgency?” he asked. “Are we willing to embrace the disruption and combat complacency with the same fervor we fought Covid?”
In response to a question about how to produce large-scale change in America’s education system, Cardona advised investment in educational institutions rather than individuals.
“I always say, let's invest in systems, not superheroes — because superheroes leave. And if the superheroes leave, they take their great ideas with them — what’s happening to the system?” he said.
Cardona used “Flor Pálida,” a song by Marc Anthony about wilted flowers, as a metaphor during his remarks. He described schools and students as roses that are either wilting or flourishing, depending on their conditions, and added that teachers are the key to help struggling students blossom.
“The resources provided by the federal government allowed for fresh new soil and better gardening tools,” Cardona said. “But we together — we are the master gardeners that must provide the nutrients, the care, and the attention that our wilted roses need.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a rare private gathering on Harvard’s campus, members of the Cambridge City Council and the new Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 attended a full-day training earlier this month to begin fostering a stronger working relationship.
During the event — which was held Oct. 6 at the Harvard Faculty Club — Huang, the Council, and several top city officials met to identify obstacles to effective communication and ways to improve the relationship between each side of city leadership.
The city considered the event exempt from Massachusetts’ Open Meeting Law, which requires nearly all meetings between members of a “public body” to be advertised at least two days in advance and open to all members of the public. Huang and several councilors said the Oct. 6 gathering did not fall under the law because it was considered a “training” that did not include any discussion of specific policy goals or agendas.
The Open Meeting Law includes carve-outs for a “conference, training program, or event,” provided the participants do not deliberate on “any matter within the body’s jurisdiction.”
Under its charter, Cambridge’s government is run by a city manager who oversees day-to-day city operations, including the city budget, and implements policy goals set by a democratically elected City Council. The relationship between the Council and the city manager has been tense in years past, with some councilors expressing dissatisfaction over the level of transparency and communication between the two branches.
Huang, who officially began as city manager in early September, said in an interview he and Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui arranged the training to “create greater trust, greater collaboration, greater communication.”
“I am coming into the role new and with sort of fresh eyes,” Huang said. “This was a really great opportunity to look at what’s working, where there are pain points from the Council side, where there are pain points from city leaders, and to talk about some of the deeper values and norms that we want in the relationship.”
Councilor Marc C. McGovern said City Solicitor Nancy E. Glowa, who attended the training, intervened if any attendee said something that might “veer in the wrong direction” and potentially violate the Open Meeting Law.
“There was no deliberation about policy, there was no talk about goals, it wasn’t about what direction we want to take the city in,” McGovern said. “Nothing like that.”
Huang said councilors expressed concerns during the training about a lack of responsiveness from city staff, while staffers said they felt “stretched” thin between day-to-day operational work and requests from the Council.
“I think councilors feel like they aren’t heard, and that they’re passing policy orders, and that they really want to say, ‘the city should consider doing X, Y, Z,’ and it feels like the city can be a black box,” Huang said.
“On the flip side,” he added, city staff receive “all these new requests coming through from the Council that need to be responded to, and I think sometimes they feel like it’s not possible to get it all done, and they don’t feel appreciated for the good work that actually has been accomplished.”
Huang said city staff and the Council are working to establish a written “concrete set of communication protocols or practices.”
He added that a new chief of staff position in the City Manager’s office will “create more engagement” between the Council and city staff.
“This definitely all feeds into the need for there to be a bit more staffing to manage what is a really important relationship,” he said.
In an interview, Siddiqui said she is working with Huang to arrange a public roundtable to discuss policy priorities. She also said she hopes to plan a separate retreat for councilors to discuss communication among themselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Phillip Brooks House Association’s Deaf Awareness Coalition, a student group dedicated to raising awareness about Deaf culture, accessibility, and American Sign Language, has started recruiting members for its fall class of volunteers.
Previously known as the Deaf Awareness Club, the organization was rebranded last fall as the Deaf Awareness Coalition under PBHA, with the goal of strengthening its advocacy and service efforts.
DAC co-director Alyvia R. Bruce ’23-’24 said the pandemic negatively impacted the organization and forced it to find a new direction.
“Each semester, we had quite a few members volunteering at Deaf Inc. over in Allston, and we were also doing a couple of service projects with nearby schools,” Bruce said. “Covid hit, and it was really, really difficult to continue to do the events that we were hosting because of how reliant they were on in-person communication.”
“When we all got back to campus last year, in 2021, the institutional memory of DAC was still there, but the membership and the volunteers and all of the events that we were doing were not,” Bruce said.
In addition to event programming, DAC frequently works with Harvard’s ASL language program in the Linguistics Department. Bruce said she hopes to expand this collaboration.
“We currently have one professor, and the classes are being way oversubscribed. He only has the capacity to teach so many students,” Bruce said.
“So we are going to be sending out a petition to students to see in terms of interest levels, so that we can present that to the University. And we are going to be really, really, really pushing for more formal steps to be taken to add additional staff and professors to the ASL program,” she added.
DAC members have been fundraising to allow the organization to continue offering non-credit ASL classes to Harvard students and the greater Boston area.
“For introductory ASL classes, we'll bring in a professor or someone who is certified to teach ASL, and do informal sessions for students who feel like they want to learn, maybe a little bit more than they have the opportunity to,” Bruce said.
Looking ahead, Bruce said the organization plans to host monthly language tables in upperclassman houses and collaborate with local colleges like Boston University for community-service efforts.
DAC is “an organization that is advocating for change at the University and higher level and also creating change at a service level,” Bruce said.
Bruce added that the organization welcomes all skill levels.
“You don't have to know ASL,” she said. “In fact, if you don't know ASL, this would be a great place to practice with people who do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
International affairs experts discussed modern and historical threats of nuclear war at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Monday evening.
The conversation, which was co-sponsored by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, included Kennedy School government professor Graham T. Allison ’62, New School international affairs professor Nina Khrushcheva, and Washington Post foreign affairs columnist David R. Ignatius ’72. The panelists discussed current US-Russia relations and lessons from the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Allison kicked off the event with an overview of the Cuban Missile Crisis, as well as how President John F. Kennedy ’40 responded to the confrontation.
“Fortunately, Kennedy refused to make an immediate decision, instead, insisting on time for deliberation. Over the course of the week, he and his key advisors changed their minds more than once,” Allison said.
Khrushcheva followed by providing Russia’s perspective at the time of the crisis.
“[Cuba] is an ally, so we’re not gonna allow [the United States] to do anything to Castro,” Khrushcheva said. “What we are going to do is we are going to throw a hedgehog into Uncle Sam’s pants — and that rocket sent to Cuba was that hedgehog.”
Ignatius discussed how lessons learned from Kennedy’s actions during the 1962 crisis could be applied to President Joe Biden’s response to the ongoing war in Ukraine.
“I want to start with the big obvious lesson, which is just how important it is to be careful and sensible in situations where you’re uncertain about the outcome,” Ignatius said. “I am pleased that the Biden administration is being pretty careful from what I can see.”
Khrushcheva said Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to learn the lesson former Soviet Union First Premier Nikita Khrushcheva — her grandfather — learned during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
“Even if you control things, you can’t control things,” Khrushcheva said. “That’s a lesson that Putin hasn’t learned, but Khrushcheva did.”
“Khrushcheva, in fact, delivered his final message to Kennedy on the radio — without warning anybody — because he really wanted it to take the global atmosphere, and explain, and say that they’re done,” she added, referring to Khrushcheva’s 1962 radio address at the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Khrushcheva added that ignoring history has grave consequences, saying that "it does punish very severely those who haven’t learned" from the lessons it offers.
"In my view, Vladimir Putin learned zero lessons from this," she said of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In response to an audience question, Khrushcheva discussed how the world might predict Putin’s decision-making when it comes to nuclear threats.
“Putin is a singular decision-maker and therefore it’s very easy to predict what he is going to do,” Khrushcheva said. “Basically a lot of it, what has happened, is about power, is about him staying in power — because if he cared about the country, he would have left and there are plenty of people who can take care of this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only five games left in the regular season, No. 15 Harvard field hockey is making moves towards another Ivy League championship and NCAA tournament run. The Crimson has toppled two of their Ivy League rivals thus far, Penn and Yale, leaving three schools to go over the next few weeks.
“The skill level difference or tenant difference that might be on each team certainly has less impact on the game because the energy and the proud school colors, so to speak, take over in these games,” head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said.
This weekend, Harvard will travel to Hanover, N.H. to take on Dartmouth. Around this time last year, the Crimson defeated the Big Green 4-0, marking their seventh straight win against the team. Though the odds seem to be in Harvard’s favor, it is worth noting the increase in competitiveness brought to these Ivy League games given the reputation of Harvard as the reigning Ivy League champions and 2021 Final Four contenders.
“[Dartmouth] will still go all out to get the win, to defend their colors, to defend their school,” van Herwaarden commented. “It brings a different level of energy and I think that's something we bring as well knowing that we have a level to play for…it makes for exciting games.”
Perhaps the toughest Ivy team to beat will be Princeton. Harvard and Princeton are arguably the two best teams in Ivy League field hockey, splitting Ivy titles over the course of 2016-2019. Last year, Harvard earned a well-fought 2-1 victory over the Quakers after a penalty shootout in overtime, granting them their championship name.
Though the anticipation of their contest against Princeton is building, this overtime win was one of the most memorable in the team’s history. On this same note, Harvard has historically tended to dominate in overtime scenarios. With three already this season, and two being double overtime situations, the Crimson has won all of them. Even last year, Harvard found itself in six overtime situations. The team won all five but lost the last against reigning NCAA champions Northwestern in the Final Four game, in which they put a point on the board. Despite this, they still posted two impressive shutouts and overtime wins against No. 6 Louisville and No. 2 Michigan in the tournament.
Just this weekend, the Crimson tallied another double overtime win against the University of Massachusetts at Lowell in a feisty 2-1 battle. With goals from junior Siofra Murdoch and first-year Bronte-May Brough and stellar defense of the net by senior Ellie Shahbo, the netted rebound from Murdoch after a stop by the River Hawk’s goalie from a shot from Brough lifted the Crimson past UMass Lowell.
“With the power from Bronte or Siofra Murdoch we can hurt their penalty corners,” the head coach said. “I think that has improved this past season.”
In these overtime situations, Harvard has a more controlled approach as opposed to overrunning it very quickly and rushing towards the net.
“When the overtime goes down to seven people, we have a lot of quality people to choose from, so I think that's the first thing that plays a big factor in being able to dominate them,” van Herwaarden reflected.
“I think we have a lot of hockey IQ or hockey intellect on the field, so we play very smart,” the coach continued. “The space that you give up is so huge and can be so dangerous, that we tend to be very patient and disciplined in how we play these overtime scenarios.”
The Crimson have also been scoring more easily this year in comparison to last, marking improvement in their offense given their reputation for being one of the top defensive teams in field hockey.
“I think that the broadness and depth of our forward line has been tremendous so far this year,” van Herwaarden noted. “Building the growth from our midfield to forward line, with the forward line being a little smarter in their connection all together, I think it has increased over the last couple of weeks and that shows in the number of goals.”
In their recent 4-0 triumph against Yale, Harvard scored easier in the first half, but had difficulty scoring in their game against UMass Lowell on Sunday.
“If we want to be successful in the postseason we cannot let that happen, you know prepare for every game as if it's your last one,” the head coach said.
“I think that will be our mindset for the next couple of games…if we do that, the best is yet to come.”
Another tough but fruitful game for Harvard was against No. 9 St. Joseph’s in the torrential downpour. The Crimson only lost 1-0 given the harsh conditions and expeceptional offense from the Hawks.
“St. Joseph’s was a really great game for us…we knew that they score easily and have a very stellar defense,” van Herwaarden said. “It's great to play those types of games to see how we match up with them.”
“I felt we were dominating 60-70% of the game especially between the 25 yard lines so at midfield we were more in control. The way we played, the way we controlled most of the game was actually very positive.”
The recent loss against St. Joseph’s, domination against the Yale bulldogs, and a mighty win over the UMass Lowell River Hawks have boosted Harvard’s confidence and kept them en route towards another successful end of season push.
Next up, Harvard will hit the road to Big Green territory for more Ivy play on Friday afternoon at 3:00 PM EST. On Sunday, it will host Delaware at 12:00 PM on Berylson Field in Cambridge, MA.

Every Ivy parties in…how should I say this…its own particularly interesting way. Dartmouth throws underground parties — cool. Princeton opts for their eating clubs — bougie, I guess? Cornell and Penn attempt to live up to their state school rep with good ol’ greek life — basic. (And Brown has intentionally been omitted due to lack of information because,,, yeah). To each their own, but if we’re being honest here, we have something that all of our so-called competitors are truly missing out on. And no way am I talking about Harvard’s final clubs — we’re talking Tasty Basty.
So what is Tasty Basty, you ask? If you don’t know, either you’ve been hiding under a rock or you just got to campus (hey first-years <3). Tasty Basty, otherwise known as The Tasty Burger Basement, is Harvard’s newest glorious landmark. With its musty aromatic scent, filthy sparkling floors, and overall absurdity grandeur, this go-to party spot on 40 JFK Street is pretty top-notch.
Outside of the typical DFMOs, sweaty basement mosh pits, and the infamous electric shuttle incident of Spring 2022, let’s recap the most absurd things that have happened in Tasty Basty.
1. “Visitasty”
Indicators of Spring at Harvard: rain pouring, flowers blooming, and Visitas children flooding campus. In order to maximize this “welcome to Harvard—please come here” experience last spring, Tasty Burger basement hosted a rager. What more could a pre-frosh want than paying a $5 entrance fee for a moist basement filled with future classmates?!?!??! I heard this one was incredible. I’m just so sad to have missed this epic Tuesday throwdown. </3
2. The Harvard Rowing Team Takeover
POV: you spend more time in the basement of a fast food restaurant than on the Charles practicing your sport. The rowing team has basically claimed Tasty Basty as their own They even went so far as to create Tasty Burger-themed merch with their very own genius slogan, TBBBC – “Tasty Burger Basement Boatclub.” Kk.
3. My Halloween Experience
Let’s set the stage: Tasty Burger basement. Halloween night. A mild 101℉. The rowers threw, the student body gathered, and everyone dressed up. Most people sported cute costumes with minimal fabric. Others took a more dressing-up-is-suggested-but-not-required stance. I, however, was dressed to the nines (not). To compliment my beloved upperclassman teammate going as the Disney princess, Belle, I was required to attend TBB Halloween as the Beast……. wearing a hot, full-length, thick fur onesie paired with a shaggy wig, sideburns, and a painted-on unibrow and beard. I knew it was bad when my casual “Hey guys!” was met with screams and questions such as, “Uh do you even go here???”
4. Having an actual meal in Tasty Burger
A rare occurrence. I’d bet my $5 entrance fee 10 bucks you haven’t done it.
