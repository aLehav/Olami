After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics' spring Fellows Program will include two former members of the House of Representatives, a White House senior speechwriter, and a senior political adviser to U.S. generals in Iraq, among others, according to an announcement last Thursday.
In a statement announcing the IOP's newest fellows, Eric R. Andersen, the director of the IOP's Fellows and Study Groups program, said that he was excited to have these political leaders join the IOP's spring program.
“This ideologically diverse group of political professionals possess a deep knowledge of international diplomacy, foreign affairs, speechwriting, and legislating on Capitol Hill," Andersen said.
As in previous years, this semester’s fellows bring a diverse set of experiences in politics.
Caroline J. Croft was a senior adviser at the U.S. Department of State, where she has worked since 1992. During that time, she lived and worked in 34 countries.
She previously served as the executive director of the United States U.N. office in Washington, D.C. and has worked with the White House Millennium Council.
Former U.S. Representative Bob Inglis, a Republican, will join the spring Fellows program after losing his re-election bid in a primary last June. He represented the 4th district of South Carolina from 1993 to 1999 and again from 2005 until 2011.
Most recently, he was a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on Science and Technology.
Inglis will be joined by another former colleague on Capitol Hill: Former U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak will also join the Fellows program after having chosen not to seek re-election last fall. He had represented the first district of Michigan in the House of Representatives since 1993 and was a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Ellen Qualls joins the group as another Capitol Hill veteran. She served as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's senior adviser for strategic planning. Before moving to Washington, Qualls worked for then-Va. Gov. Mark R. Warner, who is now a U.S. senator.
A veteran of the Bush administration, John McConnell served in the White House from 2001 to 2009 as a senior speechwriter and White House deputy assistant to the president and assistant to the vice president. He began working for former President Bush on the campaign trail in 2000 and followed him to the White House.
Emma Sky has spent the last three years as a senior political adviser to U.S. Generals Raymond T. Odierno and David H. Petraeus in Iraq. A British civilian who speaks both Hebrew and Arabic, she previously served as the civilian representative of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq.
Each of these figures will spend the next semester interacting with the Harvard community in a variety of settings including weekly study group, which allows them to work with Harvard students in an informal setting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For just the second time this season, the Harvard women’s hockey team completed a weekend sweep.
After defeating St. Lawrence on Friday, the Crimson (8-7-2, 7-3-2 ECAC) came up with its second consecutive victory last night at the Bright Hockey Center, claiming a 3-2 win over Clarkson.
“We were coming off a huge win [Friday] against St. Lawrence, so we were really fired up to play Clarkson,” freshman Marissa Gedman said. “We definitely came out flying all three periods and had the edge the whole game.”
Harvard controlled the contest from the outset, bringing a two-goal lead into the third period. The Golden Knights (7-13-3, 4-6-1) fought back in the final frame, pulling within a single goal, but were unable to even the score.
The Crimson relied on strong defense and a balanced offense to earn the win, receiving scores from three different Harvard players—Gedman, freshman Lyndsey Fry, and tri-captain Kate Buesser.
“I was happy with how our kids played,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “We hung on and did a good job.”
After keeping Clarkson off the scoreboard throughout the first 40 minutes of play, the Golden Knights’ offense came alive in the final period.
Once the puck dropped to start the third, it didn’t take long for the visitors to net their first score. When Harvard senior Leanna Coskren was sent to the penalty box for checking with 18:35 to play, Clarkson used its advantage to find the back of the net. Just 19 seconds into the power play, forward Carly Mercer scored off a pass from Danielle Skirrow to pull within one.
“We were just a little hesitant at the beginning of the kill,” Stone said.
Up just 2-1, the Crimson received some insurance from Buesser.
With just less than 11 minutes to play, Buesser came up with the puck behind her opponent’s net. The forward skated along the boards before turning and swooping toward the cage, finishing with a shot that sailed between the netminder’s legs.
With Buesser’s goal, Harvard appeared to have the contest locked up, but the visitors made one last push.
With three minutes to play, Clarkson pulled its goalkeeper and, using its one-man advantage, netted a score from Juana Baribeau with 27 seconds to play. But the Crimson’s defense held firm over the contest’s final seconds, keeping the Golden Knights from registering a shot attempt and sealing the 3-2 victory.
“It got closer at the end than it should have been,” Stone said.
While Harvard’s defense slipped up at times during the final period, the Crimson defenders played a nearly flawless first two periods.
After 40 minutes of play, Clarkson had registered just seven shot attempts, and sophomore goalie Laura Bellamy—who picked up her seventh win in net—had stopped them all.
“We’re getting stingy [on defense] and that’s what we need to do,” Stone said. “I think our defensemen are starting to feel better and a little bit more confident.”
Harvard’s offense also had a strong start.
It took Harvard less than seven minutes to get on the scoreboard, as Fry finished a pass from tri-captain Liza Ryabkina with 13:22 left in the first to take the 1-0 lead.
The Crimson padded its lead in the second frame, capitalizing on a Golden Knights penalty to go up 2-0. Gedman did the honors on Harvard’s second score, firing a shot from just inside the blue line that sailed past the Clarkson goalkeeper and into the net.
“I was just trying to get it to the net and good things happened,” said Gedman, who now has two scores on the season.
The Crimson continued to push the pace offensively, entering the third period with a 24-7 shot advantage and a 2-0 lead.
With the two weekend victories, Harvard moved into a tie for second place in the ECAC standings,
“Every win is so important,” Stone said. “That’s our goal is to win two every weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first Ivy League contest of the season last year, the Harvard women’s basketball team suffered a one-point upset at the hands of Dartmouth on the road.
This time around, at home, the Crimson exacted its revenge—and much more.
Harvard (8-6, 1-0 Ivy) thoroughly outclassed the Big Green (4-11, 0-1) at Lavietes Pavilion last night in a blowout win, 82-49. For the fourth straight game, junior point guard Brogan Berry led the way with 18 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Rookie Christine Clark also had 18 points to accompany her 10 rebounds for the first double-double of her young career. The result was crucial for the Crimson, not only because it was the first Ivy win of the year but also due to the history between these two programs.
“Huge,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith of the win. “There’s no rivalry in the league like Harvard-Dartmouth. It doesn’t matter what their record is, and it doesn’t matter what our record is—it just matters that they have the same number of banners as we do. We’re always going to battle each other. I don’t think there’s been a blowout like this between the two teams in a long time.”
Dartmouth—which was competitive for only the first 15 minutes of the contest—seems to still be reeling from losing former Ivy League Player of the Year, senior forward Brittney Smith, to a season-ending injury in the team’s seventh game.
Both teams had a promising start, exchanging baskets and playing tenacious defense. Dartmouth opened the scoring after sophomore forward Miriam Rutzen fouled Cassie Cooper, who made both of her free throws. That would prove to be the Big Green’s largest lead of the game, with 19:35 left in the first period.
Berry found co-captain Christine Matera for the corner trey, which she hit with a hand in her face. Dartmouth forward Janelle Ross, who finished the game with a team-high 15 points, answered on the other end with a shot in the post. But, on the following possession, senior forward Emma Markley mimicked Ross and scored from close range, setting the score at 5-4. Markley was second on the team with 16 points and recorded four blocks and four steals.
There were five lead changes until the Crimson took over the contest. Clark, running along the baseline, found Berry, who sank the trey from the right corner to give Harvard a three-point lead with 13:53 remaining in the half.
Dartmouth’s ensuing possession was cut short by Markley’s block on Ross, and Berry dished the ball out to sophomore guard Jasmine Evans for the long jumper to increase the lead, 17-12.
A series of mistakes by the Big Green and Markley’s emphatic blocks kept Dartmouth from scoring for nearly 10 minutes. With nine minutes left in the half, Berry delivered the ball perfectly to Rutzen, who was moving towards the basket. Rutzen was able to maintain control of her body long enough to make the shot and sustain the foul. Her free throw completed a three-point play and made the score 20-12.
Berry completed a 10-0 run after reading a pass, stealing the ball, and finishing on the other end with a simple layup to set the score at 22-12 with 7:37 left to play in the period.
Sasha Dosenko ended the scoring drought for the Big Green with a lefty hook shot, and Cooper also scored on the ensuing Dartmouth possession. Cooper finished the game with a double-double, scoring 15 points and grabbing 10 boards.
With four minutes left, the visiting team cut the deficit to five, but it only took two minutes for the Crimson to bump the lead back to nine.
Ross, on a fast break, caught a fumbling ball and converted the basket to keep it close, but a series of passes between Berry, Clark, and Evans on another fast break led to a layup with 50 seconds left.
“I just love the balanced scoring,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’re trying to be unselfish.”
Harvard followed up by forcing a jumpball, and with the final possession of the first half the Crimson milked the clock down to the final second. Lippert, seeing that time was running out, threw a three-pointer off the backboard to give Harvard its biggest lead of the half, 34-22.
The deficit only got bigger for Dartmouth, who trailed the Crimson, 48-24, with 15:49 remaining in the second period. It was clear that Harvard would run away with this one, but unlike the game against NJIT, Delaney-Smith did not feature most of her roster. With her starters in the game for the majority of the second period, the Crimson was able to extend the lead to 35 after Rutzen made a shot on a fast break with 8:29 on the clock.
“We never really expected to win by this big,” Berry said. “We just come into every game trying to execute little things, like defense, rebounding, and our plays. We go out there, try to play as hard as we can, and if we win by 30, we win by 30.”
Harvard shot 49.2 percent from the field and 8-of-19 from beyond the arc. Dartmouth had no chance of keeping up with the hot-scoring Crimson, shooting 6.7 percent from downtown and 31.3 percent overall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2011 season has just gotten underway, and the Harvard men and women’s track and field teams are already proving to be a dominating force. Both squads were successful in multiple events Friday night at the Gotham Cup, hosted by the New York City Armory.
The Crimson men had a strong showing in the individual middle distance races. In the 800-meter run, co-captain Brian Hill scored the only first-place finish for the Harvard men. With a time of 1:53.01, Hill bested Brandon Burton of Hampton by just under half of a second. Sophomore Jeff Homer also turned in a ninth-place finish in the event, crossing the line in 1:56.48.
In the 1000-meter run, freshman Ryan Romain beat out fellow rookie Tyler Cusick with a time of 2:34.33. Romain’s time was good for 12th place, leaving Cusick one spot below him. Sophomore Jared Squires rounded out the top Harvard finishers in the event, recording a time of 2:36.12, good for the 21st spot.
“I think we really did great,” Romain said. “It was our first real competition of the season, and we had some really good times…After this, I think we’re going to have a really strong season.”
The Crimson long-distance runners racked up strong results as well. Harvard took home third place in the distance medley race. Hill, sophomore Stewart Richardson, and freshmen James Leakos and Erik Kraus teamed up in the event, just missing out on second place but managing to grab the bronze for the Crimson. Junior Darcy Wilson also turned in a third-place finish in the one-mile run, posting a time of 4:10.58.
The Harvard men competing in the field events did not disappoint either. In the weight throw, the Crimson had four finishers in the top 25. Freshman Dustin Brode took home the highest finish in the field events of the night, scoring a distance of 16.37 meters, good enough for third place. Co-captain Ablorde Ashigbi and sophomore Matthew Polega finished in 14th and 15th, respectively, and senior Eric Clayman came in 25th place to round out the top Crimson finishers in the event.
In the pole vault, senior Sean Gil and sophomore Fedor Garin tied for fourth with 4.45 meters. Harvard was the only school to have two teammates finish in the top seven in the event. For the shot put, sophomore Edward Brucker put the Crimson on the board, picking up fifth place.
Like the men, the women saw positive results in the middle-distance races. Freshman Natalia Paine posted a time of 1:17.57 in the 500-meter dash, earning Harvard’s lone spot in the top eight. In the 800-meter run, junior Meghan Looney took home fifth place with a time of 2:17.93.
Freshman Alaina Murphy rounded out the Crimson women’s top results in the middle-distance races. She nabbed a fourth-place finish in the 1000-meter run, crossing the line in 2:59.67, just one second away from taking third place.
Harvard also took home the gold in the distance medley, with juniors Kailyn Kuzmuk, Sana Raoof, and Catherine Ressijac and freshman Kristina Funahashi teaming up to take home the top prize in the event.
“Going into it, you’re just trying to shake off the rust from winter training, but we just wanted to go out there and have fun,” Kuzmuk said. “We thought we had a good shot going into it, but you’re never really sure. We were really excited after because it’s a great way to start the season.”
The women’s field team also posted strong results for the night. In the pole vault, sophomore Sydnie Leroy and freshman Adrienn LaChance tied for second place, both finishing with 3.55 meters. Freshman Adabelle Ekechukwu managed to grab seventh place in the weight throw, and sophomore Chelsea Gilbert scored a 13th-plce finish in the event.
The Crimson women had two top-five finishes in the shot put. Freshman Alysha Johnson took second place with 13.37 meters, while sophomore Shannon Watt finished just slightly behind her teammate with 12.89 meters, good for fifth place.
Despite the long winter break, the Crimson had success at the Gotham Cup, an indication that 2011 has the potential to be a strong year for track and field.
