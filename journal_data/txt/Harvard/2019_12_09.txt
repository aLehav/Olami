After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among the many possible explanations for the outcome of the 2016 election, one statistic is particularly eye-catching. It comes from a 2017 study of cable news bias, which reveals that for every ten minutes of weekly Fox News viewership in a particular region, Republican vote share increases 1.2 percent. In an election that turned on three swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — where Donald Trump won by a margin of less than one percent, this suggests that one way we could have avoided Trump’s presidency would have been to reduce Fox News consumption in just three states by a mere ten minutes per week.
I’m not a well-versed historian of propaganda, but I think it’s obvious to recognize what Fox News has done as a breakthrough in the field. Other studies have added to the “news” network’s impressive accolades. One attributes George W. Bush’s victory in 2000 in part to the rollout of Fox News over the previous four years. Another indicates the mild effect Fox News can have on policy decisions. Some journalists have pointed out the frequency with which Trump’s political rants on Twitter are preceded by similar programming on Fox.
The existence and efficacy of Fox News is just one aspect of today’s informational ecosystem that has been called out for its effect on political and social divides. Particular attention is often given to the role of new technologies and social media. Fake or false news, whether generated by foreign political meddlers or profit-seeking Macedonian teenagers, has proliferated on the social media sites that now serve as a primary news source for most Americans. Social media algorithms also induce echo chamber-like information loops that exacerbate social and political divides.
Understanding the problematic aspects of social media for our informational ecosystem is important and has prompted serious reflection on possible solutions. Greater fact-checking by social media platforms like Facebook, reducing the performative nature of social media posting, regulating Twitter bots, and less anonymity on online social spaces are a handful of the numerous productive ideas circulating that will help keep the influences of the new social media landscape in check.
But if we are to really learn from the mistakes of our past, we should look more closely at the example that has been set by Fox News. As a cable television network in an age where kids learn how to create Instagram accounts before they learn how to change TV channels, Fox News is a thorn in the side of the narrative that social media destroys journalistic integrity.
Unlike social media, the narrative of Fox News is not new. Partisanship has always been a feature of journalism, an unavoidable consequence of human psychology. From the Sedition Acts of our Founders’ time, to the sensationalist “yellow journalism” of the late 19th century, to the Rush Limbaugh radio program of 30 years ago, the history of American journalism is rife with instances of Fox News-like bias. So we should not panic in the face of Fox News and the partisan journalism it embodies. There are even many reasons — from its dying viewer cohort to shifting demographics in the U.S. overall — to believe it is a problem that will resolve itself over time even without the active and creative resistance to it that it deserves.
Nevertheless we can gain valuable insights from understanding the success of the Fox News phenomenon today. First, Fox News exploits differences in the less educated and the working class. Fox News’ largest demographic difference in comparison with other cable news channels is its reach among the less educated. Thirty-five percent of its viewers in 2018 had a high school diploma or less, compared to 23 percent for its closest liberal analog, MSNBC. Its second largest gap is among blue collar workers, at 24 percent compared to 14 percent. We need an economic system that people feel included in enough to not be searching for someone to blame, and an education system that can prepare people to not be duped by a TV network’s facile narrative of who’s to blame.
Second, Fox News preys on the worst parts of the left today. The criticisms of liberal elitism and college snowflakes are, if dramatic, at the very least grounded in reality. If the left wants to bemoan today’s divisiveness without budging from its ideologies, it can at least be more proactive about controlling the narratives around it. Fox News and others will continue to milk the narrative of the liberal elite, but we can make it less credible if we start behaving with more tact. This doesn’t mean caving on issues we care about as much as it means acknowledging that politics isn’t about just being right.
Among the many things that Fox News is, it is a model for understanding how partisan journalism functions. In the tameness of the solutions it invites — time and social reform, rather than resistance to technology or an overhaul of free speech — it is also a reason to think that the American democracy is not as doomed as current dialogue would have us believe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last spring, I committed to Harvard primarily for one reason: I believed in its motto, “Veritas.” Even if truth had the potential to be, in the words of Joseph Conrad, a “commingling of desire and hate,” I subscribed to the idea it should still be held in the highest regard.
Naively, I thought that the exploration and advancement of truth would shape the goals of the Harvard community. After all, Harvard’s motto does not attempt to sugarcoat reality: There is no “lux” in front of “veritas” to suggest that the irrefutable is bright or positive. There is just Truth. And that stands on its own.
But the truth is that the average modern Harvard student is driven by an entirely different desire: that for power. It is why over 100 undergraduates rushed to line up for first-round interviews with the Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment Group this past September, many of whom were freshmen without any previous interest in consulting. It is why 49 percent of the Class of 2019 entered the workforce in either the financial services, technology, or consulting industries and only 7 percent decided to pursue academia or research. Rather than dedicate one’s life to the advancement of truth, it is far more likely that a Harvard College graduate pursues the visible markers of power: wealth, status, and prestige.
Yet this alone is not a novel observation. Students have been struggling with Harvard’s true identity for decades. The problem is that the divergence in what that Harvard preaches, truth, and what it actually imparts to students, power, has never been more accentuated than it is today — and this negatively impacts students by obfuscating their identities.
For individuals at Harvard, part of the craving for power that students develop is a result of the increasing ubiquity and inescapability of societal hierarchies. Instagram, LinkedIn, and Punch.lol intensify Harvard’s already stratified social and professional ladders. The Harvard seal itself, which the rise of college rankings has imbued with a connotation of prestige, constantly reminds students of their place in society’s hierarchies. Woefully unaware, and forever unfulfilled, we only lust after ever more power.
At an institutional level, Harvard further invalidates veritas by prioritizing the accumulation and conferment of power over truth. On the one hand, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana claimed that Harvard chooses “Veritas, honor, and inclusion” as its values. On the other, the College’s legacy preferences retain elite power by demarcating applicants on the basis of privilege — not merit — and the Office of Career Services promotes a culture where the post-graduate opportunities surpass intellectual exploration in importance, all in addition to “transformative experience” becoming a meme more broadly.
It is no surprise that the Business and Technology Career Fair, which represents industries that will attract half of what was originally the most diverse class in Harvard’s history, occurred just three days before the fall course registration deadline. Over the course of the fall semester, Harvard put on eleven career fairs. Comparatively, the University of Pennsylvania hosted eight; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, three; and Princeton University, two. As freshmen, my friends and I interpreted this inundation of pre-professional events as the OCS saying, “Welcome to Harvard! …Now, make us proud; get a job!”
Yet there is nothing inherently wrong with pre-professionalism or, similarly, selling out. To some, these opportunities represent a pathway to realize the American Dream. But to many, these career choices are compelled mainly by an inherited and unquestioned worldview that places a high value on power. A student may choose this for themselves, but they should not be herded into doing so by their educational institution. Rather, it is the role of the University, especially ours, which singularly worships veritas, to aid students in the development of their identities. The University should help students distinguish the self from the community, evaluate oneself honestly, and select central values with which to color life. In this regard, Harvard fails — miserably.
Paradoxically, for Harvard to be truthful, it would have to recognize reality: Power supersedes veritas in importance on campus. While Harvard could do this by updating its motto, an honest concession about its values would sully Harvard’s reputation. More calamitously, this would then impair the ability of students to leverage the Harvard brand to attain the power that they desire. With such apparent costs, Harvard is stuck untruthfully claiming that its motto is veritas, when, in reality, its central value is power.
As a result, the onus is on us, the students, to come to terms with the paradox of our university. Faced with this contradiction, we must be aware, yet skeptical, of the forces driving the behavior of our classmates and the institution that we inhabit. We must be cautious, yet understanding, of the values that the Harvard bubble attempts to instill in us. That way, instead of being blindly influenced by our environment, we can cultivate identities decoupled from conformity and clarity free from falsity.
While we as individuals possess the agency to consciously adopt power as our own, we need not be ignorant of the implicit forces coercing us to do so. We need not be fooled by the paradox of veritas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced a new $5 million initiative to continue investigating Harvard’s ties to slavery. The program, headed by a committee led by Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin, proposes to specifically research Harvard’s relationship to the slave trade and abolition movements, working in close coordination with the University’s museum and library systems.
In light of past events that highlighted Harvard’s history with slavery such as the case demanding that Harvard returns daguerreotypes of slaves to a woman who says they depict ancestor case, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda’s call for reparations from the University, Bacow’s inappropriate comment referencing the 13th Amendment, and the controversy over Harvard Law School’s former seal, we believe that a programmatic understanding and acknowledgment of its ties to slavery is long past due. We hope that this committee does more than simply rehash the extensive research that has been done by others in the past, such as the History Department’s course on slavery at Harvard, Pusey Library’s exhibit on slavery, or Radcliffe’s conference addressing the historical role of slavery at universities more broadly.
Rather, we urge the committee to use the large sum of money it has been endowed with to provide more actionable ways of addressing this issue to campus currently, and in grappling with the enduring legacy of slavery that continues to affect students and other Harvard affiliates today. It is easy for research to be confined within academia and technical dialogues, but we believe that Harvard must do more.
It’s convenient that this comes at a time when the University has received a growing amount of flack in regard to its outward-facing relationship with slavery. We accept that committees play an important role in structural, institutional changes by providing a knowledge basis on a given area as a first step to more systemic measures. But this faculty committee must not stall at this first step. We hope that this action inspires meaningful, systemic change, and is more than just buffing Harvard’s reputation or another line of the committee members’ CVs.
In recognizing the enduring impact of slavery on the University and its affiliates, Harvard needs to provide actionable steps toward addressing the wrongdoings of the past and the ways in which the University continues to benefit from that historical legacy. Founded in 1636, Harvard’s beginnings are directly tied to approximately 150 years of slavery in the United States. Many early donations to the University originated in the slave economy; enslaved people worked on Harvard’s campus for professors and students; Harvard scholars promoting ideas of scientific racism, such as Louis Agassiz, helped further legitimize slavery in the United States more broadly.
In addressing the effect of these histories, Harvard must start by acknowledging the role slavery played in building the University into the world-renowned institution it is today. This issue parallels a lot of currently ongoing conversations about reparations and Universities, such as the creation of reparations funds by Princeton Theological Seminary and Virginia Theological Seminary. Harvard should consider the different forms that such reparative action can take. Some schools have opted to take the reparations route, but Harvard can take another. Regardless, we hope that the committee will not only devote itself to scholastic efforts but also seriously consider actionable steps that not only acknowledge but address its longstanding history with one of the most disgraceful chapters in our history. Reparations is but one potential course in pursuit of that broader goal.
Ultimately, while we are hopeful at the prospect of this new committee, we cannot help but note its creation in the wake of the many recent incidents involving the University and its history with slavery. This is unacceptable at an institution which so often stands behind its motto of “veritas” and truth-seeking. In the future, we expect Harvard to lead rather than respond to backlash.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College Title IX coordinator Erin Clark, who stepped into her new role Oct. 2, has spent her first two months on the job focused on making Title IX resources more accessible to the University’s undergraduates.
Clark shares the College Title IX coordinator position with Brian Libby, who came to Harvard in 2016. She replaced Emily Miller, who spent nearly six years in the role before stepping down earlier this semester.
Clark came to Harvard with more than ten years of experience in anti-sexual violence work. Since working as a student activist in college, she has held positions in the Chicago public school system and at Northwestern University. She said that her past work allowed her to focus on policies and procedures, often in awareness-raising capacities. In the past, her work has centered around supporting BGLTQ sexual violence survivors and promoting healthy sexual education.
Harvard has more than 50 Title IX coordinators, each of whom serve specific schools across the University. The Title IX coordinators respond to disclosures of sexual and gender-based harassment — separately from the formal complaint process — and help make students aware of Title IX resources and ways to report potential violations. Title IX coordinators are also responsible for helping train staff in Title IX procedures, in collaboration with the University’s other Title IX administrators.
At Harvard, Clark’s role focuses on Title IX more directly than her previous positions. She said that her new position will involve fewer late nights — and that she hopes to maintain the emphasis on group trainings and student outreach that she is familiar with from other jobs.
Clark stepped into the coordinator role shortly before Harvard released the results of the Association of American Universities’s nationwide survey in October, which was administered in April. The survey found that reported rates of sexual assault have remained constant on Harvard’s campus since the first iteration of the survey four years ago.
Clark said she views surveys as ways to understand where gaps exist in support and accessibility, and that she has studied the survey results to learn more about which members of the student body are the most underserved. She said she will continue reaching out to students and student organizations across campus.
Clark also said that she hopes students will feel comfortable coming to her with all of their experiences, both positive and negative — and that she is looking forward to helping and working with students in her new position.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Kannon K. Shanmugam lost a case in front of the Supreme Court 9-0, he was feeling down until he opened his email from David L. Shapiro ’54, his former law school professor.
“I got to the office and opened my email,” Shanmugam said. “There was a message from Professor Shapiro, and the message said 'Sorry to read about your loss, but the best lawyers get the toughest cases.'”
Shapiro — who Shanmugam described as “warm, pithy, and wise” — was a professor at Harvard Law School for four decades and served as Deputy Solicitor General under George H.W. Bush’s Department of Justice. He died Nov. 19 at age 87.
He is survived by his wife, Jane Shapiro, and a granddaughter, Ava Friedlander.
Shapiro joined the faculty at Harvard Law School in 1963 after briefly working at Covington & Burling LLP and clerking for Supreme Court Justice John M. Harlan. He took a leave of absence from the Law School to serve as Deputy Solicitor General from 1988 to 1991, and he retired in 2006.
Shapiro authored a number of books, including co-authoring numerous editions of Hart and Wechsler’s “The Federal Courts and the Federal System.”
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in an email that Shapiro was the heart and soul of “The Federal Courts and the Federal System.”
“He really shaped the field of federal courts,” Manning wrote. “David was able to bring out the complexity and nuance of the law for judges, scholars, and practitioners, and he always did so with clarity and insight.”
Manning described Shapiro as a passionate teacher who produced impactful legal scholarship.
“In a way, David was a classic adherent to the Legal Process approach,” Manning wrote. “He believed deeply in law and also believed that it should be interpreted and understood, where possible, to be reasonable, to make sense.”
Law School Professor Richard H. Fallon, Jr., called Shapiro a “magnificent teacher” who would push Fallon to give concrete examples to prove legal theories.
“It was always my disposition to have some large theory, some large generalization, and I can just hear David saying to me again and again and again, ‘Give me a case, give me a case,’” Fallon said. “His insistence that if I have some large theory or some open-ended question I had to bring it down to earth by providing him with a case is something that has stuck with me for the rest of my career in terms of both my teaching, and my writing.”
Law School Professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67, Shapiro’s successor as the William Nelson Cromwell Professor, wrote in an email that he always enjoyed working with Shapiro.
“I found him to have an appropriately cynical/amused view of faculty politics,” Tushnet wrote. “I always enjoyed my interactions with him, and regret that they won’t continue.”
Multiple colleagues and former students said Shapiro was known for employing humor to uplift those around him.
“He loved to laugh,” Fallon said. “There was a kind of indomitable insistence on maintaining good natured humorous front for others even when he personally was undergoing enormous hardships.”
University of California, Berkeley, Law Professor Amanda L. Tyler — Shapiro’s former student, advisee, teaching assistant, and co-author — recalled how Shapiro opened every course with movie reviews that were “laugh-out-loud funny.”
“If the whole brilliant law professor thing hadn't worked out, he could have done stand-up comedy and he would have been huge,” she said.
Shanmugam, the former student of Shapiro, also recalled memories of Shapiro’s love for humor and interacting with students. He added that Shapiro served as his role model.
“He was really somebody who had an incredible zest for life,” said Shanmugam.
Tyler said she decided to become a law professor while in Shapiro’s class her first semester of law school.
“He was just masterful in the classroom: brilliant but also humble, and funny, and he made the subject just come alive,” she said. “The way that he managed the classroom made the entire process of learning the law so fun and really exhilarating. It convinced me right then and there, this is what I wanted to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a demonstration that interrupted the 136th iteration of The Game, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview last week that he “respects” the right to protest but opposes activists’ decision to disrupt the game.
Bacow’s comments come after years of protests by Divest Harvard, a student group calling on the University to divest from investments in fossil fuel companies. The November demonstration, however, was an escalation of its previous efforts.
Hundreds of protestors calling on both Harvard and Yale to divest their endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt stormed the field during halftime at the Harvard-Yale football game. Fifty people, including 10 Harvard students and alumni and at least 19 Yale students and alumni, were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.
A Connecticut judge gave the arrested Harvard affiliates five hours of community service. They are also required to return to court on Jan. 27 and commit no additional offenses before their meeting.
“Look, I respect people who choose to express themselves. I respect their right to voice their opinion,” Bacow said. “I would have preferred if they had not disrupted the game. But that was not my decision.”
Bacow said Friday that he was not in contact with any of the Harvard affiliates arrested and charged at the Game.
With regards to divestment, Bacow said though he appreciates protestors’ passion, he still stands by the University’s position on this issue.
“We've had a number of protests about this. As I said, I respect the right of people to express themselves,” Bacow said. “I share their belief that action is required. We just happen to have an honest difference of opinion over what the appropriate action is.”
Bacow and former University presidents have long stood in opposition to divestment, urging that the endowment should not be used for political means.
In a September letter published in Harvard Magazine, Bacow wrote that he believes working with fossil fuel companies is a “sounder and more effective approach” for Harvard to take.
“We may differ on means,” Bacow wrote in the letter. “But I believe we seek the same ends—a decarbonized future in which life on Earth can flourish for ages to come.”
Divest Harvard declined to comment for this story.
At a Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting Tuesday, several faculty members also spoke in favor of divestment. Senior Harvard Corporation Fellow William F. Lee ’72 attended the meeting and assured the faculty that he wanted to hear their opinions about divestment.
In Friday’s interview, Bacow said the Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — was “listening carefully” to the faculty’s sentiments but maintained that divestment was not the best option for the University.
“Our job is to listen broadly,” Bacow said. “But in the end, our job, as a corporation, as fiduciaries for the University, is to act in what we believe are the best long-term interests of the University.”
Most recently, Divest Harvard and others participated in a nationwide climate strike Friday, rallying alongside Harvard’s graduate student union picketers who are striking amid contract negotiations with the University.

Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen, who took office last month, plans to establish relationships with underrepresented groups on campus during his tenure.
Nguyen is the first person of color to lead HUHS and took office Nov. 18. He previously served as the director of Student Health Services at the University of Pennsylvania.
Nguyen has studied and worked with minority populations including people of color, immigrants, and people who identify as BGLTQ. Prior to directing Student Health Services, he taught at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant professor.
At Harvard, Nguyen said he wants to connect with the University’s campus, just as he has done in the past at the University of Pennsylvania.
“My first goal is simply to learn who everyone is,” Nguyen said. “My community now is this campus. I need to learn who the stakeholders are across the campus.”
“I spent a lot of time just going out there and trying to give back to communities going to free clinics, giving free vaccinations, going to health fairs, teaching communities about how to stay healthy in their own language,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen said he developed an interest in health equity based on his experiences as a refugee from South Vietnam who arrived in America during the Vietnam War. He said he saw the impact of health disparities on minority populations as well as on his own family, helping him to recognize challenges to language access as well as discrimination in health care.
“I think that work over time gave me a lot of insight and experience that helped me in my future work — particularly as medical director,” Nguyen said. “I've been very interested in health equity for a long time.”
Nguyen said he believes it is particularly important for medical researchers to forge lasting relationships with minority populations in order to understand their experiences.
“Doing that I think has helped me to recognize how important it is, for those of us in medicine, to step out of our ivory towers of our hospitals and our clinics and connect with communities that we serve so we can understand their lives,” Nguyen said.
Nguyen said the perspective he gained from working first-hand with the underserved will guide his leadership at HUHS. For example, he wants to improve the reach of the HUHS biannual health survey, which will be released in the spring of 2020.
“I want to make sure that students from minority populations and from different backgrounds, sexual minorities, and so on are participating at high levels so that we can understand their unique perspectives as well,” Nguyen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Divest Harvard — a student organization calling for the University to sell its investments in the fossil fuel industry — hosted a rally to push for fossil fuel divestment in coordination with picketers from Harvard’s graduate student union.
Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers began its strike Tuesday after months of negotiations between the union and the University. Throughout the week, strikers invited various campus activist groups to join them on the picket line.
Organizers connected the fossil fuel divestment and labor movements at the rally, urging administrators to divest from the fossil fuel industry and negotiate a fair contract.
"When Harvard makes superficial claims to support climate and workers' rights and then acts in ways that directly goes against those interests, our university needs to know that we will not be complicit,” Divest Harvard organizer Maya H. Levine ’21 said to those congregated at the rally.
Levine reiterated Divest Harvard’s demands that the University disclose its holdings and divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies by Earth Day 2020.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email that while the University and divestment activists both agree on the “urgency” of climate change, they disagree on the methods of combating the phenomenon.
“Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions,” Newton wrote.
The rally came two weeks after hundreds of divestment protesters stormed the field during halftime at the Harvard-Yale football game. On Friday, just before the rally, a Connecticut judge gave ten of the arrested Harvard affiliates five hours of community service.
At the same time Divest Harvard was rallying in the Yard, activists across the country were leading marches to demand action from government leaders to solve the issue of climate change.
“Today, while world leaders gather at the United Nations’ annual climate conference, we are gathered on this campus to demand that Harvard disclose, divest, and reinvest by Earth Day 2020,” Levine said.
Other activist groups on campus also attended the rally Friday. Members of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign — a group calling for Harvard to divest its endowment from companies tied to the prison industry — and the Ethnic Studies Coalition — a group of students protesting Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña’s tenure denial — spoke at the rally to advocate for their respective causes and lend their support to the graduate student union.
“We have stood with the strike and the strike has stood with us for the past five days,” Rosa L. Vazquez ’20, a member of the Ethnic Studies Coalition, said in a speech at the rally. “We stand in complete solidarity.”
Ethnic studies advocates occupied University Hall for 48 minutes Monday to protest Harvard’s decision to deny García Peña’s tenure and call for the creation of an Ethnic Studies department. In addition, a protestor stood silently inside the Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting Tuesday while dozens of students demonstrated outside in protest.
In speeches, prison divestment organizers also connected their work to the graduate student union.
“HPDC stands with the Harvard graduate students union and your fight for a fair contract and for justice and respect for all workers and all people,” Zoe L. Hopkins ’22, an HPDC member, said at the rally.
“We are calling for jobs, not jails,” Hopkins added. “We believe in an abolitionist future in which fair pay, affordable healthcare, and protection from discrimination and sexual harassment are foundational.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 30 students, faculty, and members of the public gathered at Harvard’s Arthur M. Sackler Building Friday to commemorate a new art installation honoring those affected by the opioid epidemic.
Three students in the History of Art and Architecture department created the installation, entitled “Remember Their Names,” as part of their final project for a departmental junior tutorial course. The students and their peers lined the building’s main staircase; each step bore the names of local victims or survivors of opioid abuse.
“‘Remember Their Names’ hopes to disrupt the overwhelming presence of the Sackler family within the building and invites the voices and perspectives of the people the Sacklers harmed the most,” according to the artists’ statement.
Kaitlin Hao ’21 — who spearheaded the project along with Wendy Yu ’21 and Samantha J. Meade ’21 — said their most immediate goal is to marshal support and funds to install a marble memorial plaque for victims in the lobby of the museum.
“In solemnity we record the complexity of the Sackler Legacy,” reads the mock-up of the plaque display at the Friday event. “We mourn and honour the voices silenced by the opioid epidemic.”
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has refused to take down the Sackler name from the museum or return donations from the family, calling such a move “inappropriate” in an interview Friday.
The organizers of Friday’s event called on the History of Art and Architecture department to “lobby to the fullest extent” to change the building’s name and publicly rebuke Bacow’s stance on the issue.
But they said that even absent such a change — which Hao acknowledged might prove legally unrealistic — featuring the epidemic’s victims in the space was a worthwhile step forward.
“We have the right to be able to have names and families and loved ones that have been affected being remembered,” Meade said.
Harvard Art Museum spokesperson Daron J. Manoogian declined to comment on the event.
Members of the Sackler family have served as executives at Purdue Pharma, the pharmaceutical company that produces the painkiller OxyContin, and have been accused of contributing to the opioid crisis. Arthur M. Sackler — who donated millions to Harvard in the 1980s to fund the museum’s construction — died before OxyContin came to market. But many activists nonetheless contend that he helped develop marketing tactics that Purdue would later use to sell OxyContin.
“This building is a monument to Arthur Sackler, a man who bears a name with indirect yet inextricable ties to the opioid epidemic currently sweeping the United States,” Hao said.
The organizers collaborated with a Tufts University student activist group, Sack Sackler, whose lobbying efforts propelled Tufts’s decision — announced last week — to remove the Sackler name from five facilities and programs on its campus.
While multiple cultural institutions in the United States and Europe — including the Guggenheim Museum and the Louvre — had previously announced they would either remove the Sackler name from their walls or refuse any future donations from the family, Tufts was the first university to do so, a fact not lost on some attendees.
Multiple mothers of opioid victims in attendance Friday, including members of Team Sharing — a national organization that provides support to parents who lost children to substance abuse disorders — said they believe Tufts’s recent decision will increase pressure on Harvard to follow suit.
“I think it will give the University momentum to take the name down,” Team Sharing national board member Kathleen Scarpone said. “Shame on Harvard for not doing anything.”
Jillian Sackler, the widow of Arthur Sackler, wrote in an emailed statement that Arthur Sackler had nothing to do with OxyContin and did not profit from its sales.
"He did not profit from OxyContin, and none of his philanthropic gifts were in any way connected to opioids or to deceptive medical marketing – which he likewise had nothing to do with," she wrote. "It deeply saddens me to witness Arthur being associated for actions taken by his brothers and other OxySacklers.”
Activists have staged multiple protests, circulated an online petition, and engaged in a letter-writing campaign in the past year as part of their efforts to persuade Bacow to strip the Sackler name from campus. Local and national political figures, including Democratic presidential candidate and United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have supported the Harvard activists .

A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the protest was held at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. In fact, it was held at the Arthur M. Sackler Building.

Have you ever had the urge to take the shuttle around campus and talk with the people who get a glimpse into the very best and worst of Harvard student life? We know that life gets real on the shuttle, so we caught up with Raymond Quitumba Jr., a Harvard shuttle driver. We’ve always wanted to get the inside scoop from those who are the literal movers and shakers of Harvard.
How long have you been driving the Harvard Shuttle? 
I have been driving for 16 years. And I love driving. It’s my passion.
Do you have a favorite day of driving? 
The weekends. The reason why is because I see the Harvard students going out together, going to different events. There are a lot of activities going on at the Quad, and I see a lot of students when they are a little bit drunk, easygoing. I have a lot of opportunities to interact with them on weekends, so I think [those] are the busiest days when I like to drive the shuttle.
Have you had any crazy experiences? 
Crazy experiences as a bus driver … When I see some students randomly trying to stop the bus in the middle of the road. That is dangerous. It is not safe. Our priority here is the safety of the students. Safety is the key issue for us as Harvard bus drivers.
What has been your worst experience on the shuttle? 
Worst experience is when there is a snow storm, where there are a lot of snow banks, particularly on DeWolfe street which is my route on Mather B. And during the snowstorm you face a lot of challenges because you have to swing through cars to get to the bus stop.
What’s your favorite route? 
My favorite route to drive is the Allston. I started doing Allston before, and then I shifted to doing Mather. The reason I like Allston is because I get to deal with the grad students. The attitude of the grad students is different than undergrad students. Grad students are more easygoing, very straightforward. A lot of times the undergrads are busy and don’t want to be bothered.
What’s been the most fun experience?
When I see parents [and] they come with the kids on the shuttle, and I see how the kids like to ask questions regarding how we are doing driving the shuttles, and sometimes we see parents greeting us with so much passion and are so grateful for what we are providing for their children — this gives me a good feeling.
It’s easy to get caught up in busy Harvard life, but next time you board the shuttle, be sure to thank your driver!
