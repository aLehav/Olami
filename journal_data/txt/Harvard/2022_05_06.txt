After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Blazzy is a Los Angeles based designer with an expert eye for cool trends. An uncanny ability to unite the worlds of pop culture, hip-hop, and fashion has made the West Coast design powerhouse one to watch.
The Los Angeles native’s aesthetic talents have landed him collaborations with the likes of Lil Wayne, The Weekend, FaZe Clan, Air Jordan, Uber Eats, and Vlone. The clothing and pop culture merchandise available from Blazzy’s own Nothing Personal brand — such as a 100-piece puzzle of the in-game map from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas — are highly sought-after and regularly sell out.
Hailing from the city of Paramount in Southeast Los Angeles, Blazzy first found his passion for design as a graffiti artist in high school. According to the designer in an interview with The Harvard Crimson, he began by spray painting art inspired by the gang tags that are commonly found on walls in Paramount. Where “tag banging” is for the purpose of marking gang territory, Blazzy’s graffiti was simply a method of self-expression.
“I started by just tagging on walls,” Blazzy said. “And then, I decided to start doing stencils, and it got to the point where all the gangbangers and all the gang members in my area didn't know what to make of my stuff. They were wondering if this was a gang as well, or if I'm just doing my own creative thing.”
Expanding beyond Paramount, Blazzy took his talents to street art shows on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood, where he was inspired by the work of OBEY clothing founder Shepard Fairy, who famously designed the 2008 Barack Obama “Hope” campaign poster. It wasn’t until after Obama had won the election that Blazzy — a huge fan of OBEY — learned that it was Fairy who designed the iconic image.
“I remember a friend asked me about an OBEY shirt I was wearing like, ‘Do you know who Shepard Fairey is, why are you wearing that shirt?” Blazzy said. “I didn’t know and was completely dumbfounded. He put me on and I was blown away. This was another side of street art and graffiti that I hadn't been exposed to yet.”
Like Fairy, Blazzy isn’t just looking to sell tee-shirts. His store is called Nothing Personal, but the passion that the designer brings to each effort is as personal as it gets. His goal is to spread a message through his artwork. For example, the “Say No to Fentanyl” design capsule released last November via Nothing Personal calls attention to the opioid epidemic devastating families and cities across the United States.
“I've lost more friends than I have fingers to fentanyl,” Blazzy said of the project. “I've seen people literally overdose in front of me a couple times. It's sad. I’ve seen people die in front of me in my living room. It's crazy. I wanted to make something that was very personal to me.”
At this point in his career, the designer shared that he only sells products that mean something to him. “I want to make sure that if I'm putting out a tee-shirt, it's something special,” Blazzy said. “The fentanyl shirt was the only tee-shirt I dropped last year, just for the fact that I wanted to make a statement. I want to release products that people can relate to and are going to find passion in.”
Another of Blazzy’s products is a police car-shaped candle that burns for up to 72 hours. It is listed under the acronym “A.C.A.N.D.L.E.” or “All Cops Are Negligent Dangerous Law-Breaking Enemies.” It is a response to the police murder of George Floyd and the subsequent 2020 summer protests that called out racialized police brutality in American cities. “The cop car candle just came from making a list of things that I would like to burn,” Blazzy said.
First picking up Photoshop during Gucci Mane’s mixtape era in the early 2010s, Blazzy is heavily inspired by the music he listens to. The designer originally went by the name “Sandblaster,” before shortening it to Blazzy in the fashion of Kanye West’s “Yeezy” moniker. According to Blazzy, he was especially inspired by the album artwork of eclectic NorCal artist Lil B.
“I just fell in love with all the mixtape art,” Blazzy said. “Especially with Lil B dropping the ‘Green Flame,’ the ‘Red Flame,’ ‘Obama BasedGod’ and all these tapes, I thought it was crazy that you could be part of music and not even do music necessarily.”
These days, Blazzy’s career is woven into the fabric of the L.A. hip-hop scene. The designer is a regular at No Jumper, a media company based out of the city that has strong ties to L.A. artists like Shoreline Mafia and the late Drakeo the Ruler. Blazzy shared that Stinc Team duo OTM are his current favorite rappers.
“I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for music,” he added of his art. “I love music, I'm so thankful that I'm part of the conversation at times. I think that streetwear and hip-hop go hand in hand, I really do.”
Blazzy got his professional start designing album covers for rappers like Chief Keef, before making the jump to merch design for artists like Lil Wayne. The LA designer was the mind behind the “Free Tay-K” merch tee that took the internet by storm after Texas rapper Tay-K cut off his ankle monitor and fled house arrest in 2017.
However, Blazzy credits the 2018 Weezy “Carter V” tee shirt he designed in collaboration with Chinatown Market as the product that gave him his start in the industry.
“My design ended up being the best in the office, so they chose that one,” Blazzy said. “It ended up being the best selling item out of all his merch, period, at this point. Back then, I'm nine months fresh from just doing this design shit full time. Prior to this, I was working a full time job at LAX pushing boxes all day for two years.”
The high sales of Blazzy’s “Carter V” shirt art earned the designer a salaried position at Chinatown Market. Getting his start as a solo graffiti artist, Blazzy now has his own office and a team of people that work for him.
“I'm finding myself explaining who I am now a lot more than I was like, a year or two ago because it was all just streetwear people before but now it's like, ‘Blazzy, what the fuck do you do?’” the designer said. “It’s exciting to know I'm still reaching new people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matilde M. Heckler is a Berklee College of Music student looking to revolutionize music by creating her own new genre involving electric violin and passionate vocals. The Harvard Crimson recently talked with her to learn about her music journey and her one-of-a-kind sound.
A classically trained violinist, Heckler “fell in love with the musical aspect of journaling” and started songwriting in her junior year of high school. When she decided she wanted to perform her music with other people, she chose to attend Berklee as an undergraduate. A few months ago, she started a band at the college. “I got a group of people together,” Heckler said. “Ever since then, I've been going full throttle.”
When asked what drew her to music in the first place, Heckler revealed she doesn’t actually know the reasoning behind her initial passion for music and the volin. “I think I wanted to do it because all my friends weren't and I wanted to prove to my parents I could do something and follow through with it,” Heckler said.
However, today her musical passions have a bigger drive behind them. After posting songs on Spotify and performing them around campus, she has begun to receive messages from supporters saying her songs have made an impact on them. It’s that kind of positive feedback from fans that motivates her to keep making music.
“I want other women and other people who have gender non-conforming identities to know, whoever you are and no matter what background you come from, you can do that too,” said Heckler.
As for what she wants people to take away from her music, Heckler said, “I want people to find homes in my music in the same way that I do.” She continued on by comparing her songs to apartment buildings, and how each of them allows the listener to explore a new emotion.
Heckler calls her genre “Hot Girl Emo.” “It's a little feminist, It's a little funky, and unlike anything you've ever heard,” the singer said. “All tie it up with a little bow led by electric violin.” She explained her friends came up with the name, and she thinks it represents the “vibe” she embodies. The genre creates a space for her music to be categorized and understood by listeners.
“[This space] is really important to me because I am doing something with an instrument that's not conventional to the music I make, and [this genre] allows me to create anything and nobody can tell me it's wrong,” the singer said.
Heckler created this genre when she felt she was being forced into using only ukuleles and guitars as an aspiring singer-songwriter. It lead her to turn away from these typical songwriting conventions and try to create something new with violin instead. “I was taking all my songs and turning them into like looped violin parts,” she said of her initial process. But when she realized there was something missing from her music and she wanted to form a band, the songs “slowly morphed into what I want them to be.”
Looking at the bigger picture, Heckler wants to produce meaningful music as part of her career. Indeed, she admits that her music allows her to “fuse” her creative and business passions.
Heckler's latest track, titled “Emo Needs More Fucking Girls,” was released on May 6. She defines it as a “feminist punk banger.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Worcester-based comedian Sam Buck may very well be friends with your favorite rapper. Founder and host of the “Bucked Up” podcast — a show with a guestlist that ranges from his fellow New England comedians to underground hip-hop artists like Detroit rapper Bruiser Wolf the comedian was inspired to enter the world of podcasting after a bad break up and the onset of the pandemic lockdowns in March 2020.
“I thought I was gonna move to New York with this girl and you know, you get your heart broken. Shit happens,” Buck said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “Two weeks after that, everything shut down.”
The pandemic-induced stay-at-home orders marked a period of deep reflection for Buck, who had relied on live comedy appearances to make a living. The comic said that he created “Bucked Up” as an outlet to promote his comedy and work through personal issues.
“I was going for a self-help podcast where guests give me self-help,” Buck said. “I didn't think rappers were going to be on it. I was interviewing open mic comedians or friends.”
The focus of “Bucked Up” shifted to music when Buck, a lifelong hip-hop fan, found himself with a shortage of comedian co-hosts. “One day, I didn't have a guest,” the comic said. “I reached out to this producer named Freshman Woes because I had more Instagram followers than him at that point and I really loved his music.”
Freshman Woes was Buck’s first musical guest. A few weeks after his appearance on “Bucked Up,” the producer released his debut album “Thank You Rap Gods,” on which he thanks and shouts out Buck. A copy of the vinyl could be seen hanging as a personal memento in the comic’s Zoom background at his Worcester home.
Buck followed up Freshman Woes’ appearance with rapper and longtime Action Bronson affiliate Hologram, who announced his debut album with Cypress Hill producer DJ Muggs during his “Bucked Up” guest slot.
What began as a self-help program has now become an outlet for rap’s most promising underground talent. Since premiering the show, Buck has recorded over 170 episodes and amassed a rolodex of hip-hop heavyweights that includes the likes of Buffalo rapper Conway the Machine and Danny Brown’s Bruiser Brigade. Buck’s success is a result of his tireless travel schedule, changing cities nearly once a week to record his podcast episodes in-person. The comedian goes everywhere by car. “My car is 10 months old and I just passed 50,000 miles,” he said. Buck’s journey has taken him through the hip-hop holy grounds of Detroit, Chicago, Buffalo, Philadelphia, and New York City.
Reminiscing on his travels, he shared that he feels a strong connection to the rap scene in Detroit, despite its distance from Worcester. “I love the Detroit scene,” Buck said. “I wish it wasn't so far. I was with BabyTron last time I was there. I love everything from the Bruiser Brigade to the Hip Hop Lab. Icewear Vezzo to Big Sean. I love it all.” Last November, the comedian was invited to Detroit rapper Danny Brown’s iconic annual holiday celebration, the Bruiser Thanksgiving.
Calling Detroit a very close second, Buck shared that his favorite rap city is actually Buffalo, New York. Many of “Bucked Up”’s guests hail from the modern Buffalo rap scene pioneered by Griselda Records founding members Westside Gunn, Benny the Butcher, and Conway the Machine.
“I'm always for the rest of my life gonna have a connection to Buffalo,” Buck said. “I can't not. It's just an emotional connection. And then there are my favorite rappers: Benny, West, and Con. All three of them are my three favorite rappers. And they're all from Buffalo.”
Last December, Conway appeared on “Bucked Up” in what Buck said was one of his favorite episodes of the show to date. Buck was able to secure the interview with the rapper after inviting several of Conway’s Drumwork Music Group artists as guests on the podcast. Audio from Conway’s “Bucked Up” appearance even popped up on the rapper’s February 2022 mixtape, “Greetings Earthlings,” earning Buck a feature credit on the project.
“It was an interview he loved so much he put it on a track,” Buck said. “He's told me that he sees me being big and sees me being even bigger than I see myself. And like for someone who's like your idol to say that to you? I just tried to give that type of love back when I first met him and I love him to this day and now I consider him a friend.”
Buck has been thoroughly embraced by hip-hop. Conway invited Buck out to a Hartford club performance in March. The comedian participated in backstage festivities at the New York City stop of the Action Bronson-Earl Sweatshirt-Boldy James-headlined NBA Leather Tour. He is welcome at the Bruiser Brigade house in Detroit.
Buck said that he plans to leverage the success of “Bucked Up” into bolstering his stand-up career. He shared that the podcast is just a first step in his creative agenda. “I want to be undeniable,” Buck said. “That's the word that I think a lot of people use. But in my comedy and my podcast and who I am, I want to prove that I am supposed to be doing this.”
The latest episodes of the “Bucked Up” podcast can be found here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our generation is depressed. To say that is not to wallow in self-pity but to point to a serious policy problem. A generation of Americans is modally despondent, and yet institutions from Harvard on up treat addressing this crisis as a luxury instead of a basic requirement for a functional community. This approach is not sustainable.
Our latest reminder of the problem comes from Harvard’s Institute of Politics, which released its Youth Poll last month. Just over half of respondents aged 18 to 29 reported feeling “down, depressed or hopeless for several days or more in the past two weeks.” This number is double comparable figures from only 15 years ago, part of a decades-long trend that cannot be dismissed as a function of the pandemic. This trend is not merely a result of over-diagnosis, growing awareness, or shifting definitions: pollsters ask the same questions, and we give more and more worrying answers.
We recognize that Harvard’s $50+ billion endowment is not unlimited. Large swathes are restricted, and worthy competing priorities range from financial aid to cancer research. But Harvard doesn’t let those obstacles get in the way of keeping the lights on, and mental health support is part of keeping the lights on. When a third of your students think they might suffer from depression and CAMHS has a wait time of six weeks, those lights are flickering at best. Harvard has a mountain on its hands, one that’s treated like a molehill.
It may be that donors prefer funding buildings and professorships. Change their minds! Teaching students to live a fulfilled life isn’t peripheral to Harvard’s mission, it’s essential. Training functional future leaders isn’t peripheral to Harvard’s mission: It’s essential. We hope that the alumni who read this see the severity of the problem we face and consider opening their checkbooks. We hope that administrators demonstrate that they are actively soliciting such donations. The new CAMHS 24/7 hotline is proof that this approach can work; the Harvard Youth Poll is evidence that it must work faster.
Funding is not, of course, a panacea. Policy and culture also have to change, as we have repeatedly suggested. There are some obvious choices: professors should be understanding and flexible with students suffering from mental illness. Faculty and staff should be equipped to recognize warning signs as best they can and to respond appropriately. There are also more subtle policy fixes.
Student leave procedures are often an excessive burden. Students who take leave, voluntarily or involuntarily, can face requirements in order to return, including six or more months of non-academic work and onerous medical preconditions and procedural obstacles. Fulfilling these conditions off campus can be most difficult for the most disadvantaged among us. These requirements can then disincentivize those students from taking much-needed time off for their mental health.
Conversely, students who receive two “unsatisfactory grades” are forced to withdraw from school for two terms and are often not permitted on campus for the duration of their leave. Students who are suffering due to their mental health and whose grades have dropped because of it then lose their housing, meal plan, and on-campus support system. This kick to the curb is accompanied by a checklist that can be challenging to complete and which determines their ability to return. Permission to return sometimes comes just days before the start of school, leaving students’ futures in the air. Harvard’s leave system, however well-meaning its administrative design, is deeply flawed.
Within this flawed system, we nevertheless encourage those who are struggling to seek help where they can. Therapy and medication, of course, are effective treatments for many mental illnesses. Scientists have found mental health benefits in everything from meditation and exercise to vitamin D and sleep. To be clear, going for runs is not a healthcare policy: These are not comprehensive solutions. But they are tools that we can bring to bear as we wait for our lumbering home institution to catch up.
Finally, Harvard’s response to this national problem should extend beyond its gates. Funding can only help insofar as we understand the problem, and Harvard’s mission of knowledge production can change lives by filling this gap. Researchers from psychology to medicine to the humanities have great potential to contribute. We call on the University to redouble its efforts to research the determinants of youth mental health and to set high institutional standards as a model for other colleges. We ask that donors consider funding a systematic expansion of this type of research.
Harvard’s money and expertise provide an opportunity to help not only our own students but countless others who would benefit from our research. We have the power not only to help those directly afflicted but to serve a nation that will one day depend on a generation now adrift. We must exercise that power. Lives depend on it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As graduation for the Class of 2022 rapidly approaches, Commencement speakers, deans, professors, and parents alike are all preparing their grand speeches encouraging us to go forth and change the world. Last year, University President Lawrence S. Bacow conveyed his hope that the Class of 2021 would “hasten the world to better days.” Similar calls for new graduates to make an impact and improve our world will reverberate across Harvard Yard this month as students complete their coursework, collect their diplomas, and pack up their things for the next chapter in their lives.
But as the heady excitement of graduation wanes and we all settle into our new careers, will we really be changing the world? Some of us may do work creating a positive impact; some of us may not. Some of us may love our next job; some may just need it to pay the bills. There is one surefire way, however, in which every new graduate can make a huge impact and change the world for the better: by unionizing your new workplace.
Unions are for everyone. Despite popular imagination that only industrial workers need and deserve unions, every workplace can benefit from unionization, and every worker deserves a union — even Harvard alumni. After decades of right-wing attacks on workers’ rights, union density in the United States sits at historically low levels. In all likelihood, you will be entering a non-union workplace upon graduation — but you can fix that!
Despite the lost ground of the labor movement, we are living through a historic moment of renewed labor organizing and victories. Workers across all sectors are fighting for their rights, and they are winning. From nurses to teachers, Kellogg’s to Google, Hollywood to John Deere, workers are organizing and demanding more from their employers. In the last year, workers at Starbucks and Amazon successfully formed the first unions within these behemoth corporations, with more soon to come. Public support for unions is soaring, now at its highest point in the United States since 1965.
Unionization is also surging in white-collar professional work, such as nonprofit organizations, journalism, architecture, tech, media, and academia — the type of work that many Harvard graduates will pursue.
By organizing in our new workplaces after graduation, we can achieve a meaningful material impact on our lives and the lives of others — and not just those of immediate coworkers. Unionization has ripple effects across the economy at large, raising wages and standards for both union and non-union workers. Additionally, organizing your workplace can help others organize theirs. As Alex Press writes for The Nation, “[n]ewly unionized white-collar workers provide dues to increasingly cash-strapped unions,” supplying critical support to other workplace struggles across various sectors.
The change you can achieve through a union is not limited to pay and benefits. In July 2020, tens of thousands of workers walked off the job as part of the union-led Strike for Black Lives, committing to “withhold our most valuable asset — our labor — in support of dismantling racism and white supremacy to bring about fundamental changes in our society, economy and workplaces.” The Writers Guild of America, which represents TV and film writers, has flexed its muscles in opposition to Georgia’s 2021 racist voter-suppression bill and its 2019 anti-abortion legislation, threatening the withdrawal of Hollywood crews from the state, a popular filming location.
Our very own Harvard Graduate Students Union, of which I am a proud member, fought and won new protections against caste-based discrimination and sexual harassment in our new contract. Although the Harvard administration remains recalcitrant on providing real recourse for survivors of sex- and gender-based harassment, discrimination, and violence, the union has been a powerful voice in continuing to demand justice.
Unions also meaningfully strengthen democracy and give people more immediate democratic control over their lives. With democracy under siege worldwide, and American institutions and politicians increasingly unresponsive to the needs and desires of their constituents, the grassroots democracy that unions provide is essential. In addition, unions foster broader political participation. The labor movement was essential to the passage of some of the most important legislation of the 20th century, including the Social Security Act. Today, a revived labor movement can strengthen our collective power to dismantle white supremacy, combat climate change, and defeat right-wing authoritarianism.
These are massive undertakings that would undoubtedly “hasten the world to better days.” They are also too big for any of us to tackle alone. In mere months, however, we can take action to begin this process of truly changing the world. To start, simply talk with your coworkers to understand the issues they care about and imagine how your workplace could be better. With a few colleagues on board, identify some unions that might be a good fit and reach out to a representative. With their help, you and your colleagues will be well on your way to a democratic workplace. Wherever we go after graduation, we can take these steps to change the world. All it takes is talking to your coworkers and bravely demanding more together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starry spirals spinning, glowing globes in orbit, black holes beckoning us to other dimensions — outer space literally magnetic in its appeal. This appeal is what drew Denisse Cordova Carrizales ’23 to study physics. While kindled by the stars, her fascination with physics eventually dug down deeper to the molecular level. Meanwhile, Denisse’s natural instinct for storytelling led her to question what story contemporary nuclear innovations were telling — and how to rewrite that story to make innovation more inclusive.
Growing up in Houston, Denisse cultivated her storytelling voice onstage (and behind the scenes). Offstage, she used her creative voice to teach younger students scriptwriting, acting, and set design. This was in addition to her interest in novels and music. Having spent her formative years in the home of stars like Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion, she developed an intense appreciation for hip hop. With this creative background, Denisse was drawn to physics by its creative spark: the collisions of matter and energy that generate something new.
While Denisse was drawn to physics because of space, after the chaos of being evacuated off campus and adjusting to online school, space was exactly what she needed. She had initially entered Harvard hoping to build toward her Ph.D., but the burnout accompanying Covid-19 led Denisse to question whether that was the right fit. Denisse credits these questions, along with the pandemic’s disruption, with helping her find the courage to take time off from school. Even before the pandemic, Denisse had a desire to take time away. But online school allowed Denisse herself permission to go through with it. She knew she wanted to learn more about industry instead of the more familiar world of academics. So during her gap year, she joined the team of Commonwealth Fusion Systems on a mission to “deliver clean, limitless fusion power to the world.”
All too often, physicists (and others in STEM fields) are seen as faceless figures secluded blankly behind lab coats, running numbers that generate incomprehensible answers to even more incomprehensible questions. Denisse challenges this assumption from practically every angle possible. Her colorful creativity leads her to tackle vibrant problems with sweeping real-world consequences. As a scientist living in an age of climate crisis, Denisse understands how vital it is to implement clean sources of energy. However, she also understands how new energy sources can manifest in environmental racism: the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on people of color. In the case of nuclear fusion energy, the risk of environmental racism occurs when large reactors are placed in marginalized communities. Or, the lack of access to energy in some communities versus others.
Expanding access to clean energy is widely agreed to be a positive thing. At the same time, Denisse points out that providing power sources to “where they are needed most” needs to avoid paternalism. During her gap year, she tackled one key factor in preventing environmental racism: community education. Denisse saw how little education was provided to communities in being made home to reactors or other potential environmental hazards. Denisse knew firsthand how education on physics, let alone nuclear fusion reactors, was not widely available in impacted communities. This fueled her inspiration to one day begin to create an educational film on nuclear energy that is accessible and engaging — without any animation experience. After drawing out the frames in her Notes app, Denisse learned enough animation to create the film’s core content. She released the film first in Spanish, then in English, her bilingual background broadening its reach. She eventually attracted the attention of people who could help animate the film at a higher level. The result? A vibrantly educational animated short. One that allows access to clean energy to go hand in hand with access to education about it.
Just as all existing matter is forged into something new again and again, Denisse’s creativity lets her rediscover her love of studying physics by stepping away from it. Her time away from Harvard helped her remember what led her there in the first place. From learning about it to taking it and creating it, space helped Denisse discover and then re-discover what matters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the most ignorant, discriminatory, and deceptive editorials published by The Crimson, its editors call on “everyone” to promote the current form of antisemitism.
Criticism of Israel is not antisemitic. I routinely criticize its policies just as I criticize policies of our nation. This editorial implicitly supports the end of Israel and its replacement by a Palestinian state “from the river to the sea.” That is the goal of the BDS movement. Tom Friedman, the Pulitzer Prize winner, put it this way: “singling out Israel for opprobrium and international sanctions – out of all proportion to any other in the Middle East – is anti-Semitic, and not saying so is dishonest.” That is precisely what the Crimson editorial is guilty of despite its criticism of anti-Semitism “in every and all forms.”
The founders of the BDS movement apply it only to Israelis who are Jewish. Its founder refused to debate me precisely because I am a Jew who supports Israel’s existence? BDS singles out one nation from among the many with serious human rights issues, namely the nation-state of the Jewish people? That is antisemitism.
The megaphone of the Crimson will increase the high rate of anti-Semitism on campuses.
Let’s begin with five statements of fact:
1) No country faced with dangers comparable to those faced by Israel – both internal threats of terrorism and external threats of nuclear annihilation by Iran —has a better record of human rights, compliance with the rule of law, and concern for the lives of enemy civilians. Israel’s record is not perfect, but it is better than other nations facing comparable threats. (2) No country has contributed more to humanity—medically, agriculturally, scientifically, artistically – than Israel in the less than 75 years of its existence. (3) No country in recent history has made peace with more of its enemies than Israel: Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, United Arab Emirates, and others. (4) No country has offered statehood more often to those seeking to destroy it than Israel: the Palestinians could have had an independent state in 1947, 1948, 1967, 2000, 2001, 2005, and 2008. They can still have one if they are willing to come to the negotiation table and make mutually painful compromises with Israel. (5) No western democracy has been victimized by terrorism more than Israel.
A reader would not know these facts from reading The Crimson’s editorial. It mentions Palestinians who have been killed by Israeli soldiers, but omits the many Israeli children, women who have been murdered by Palestinian terrorists, or that many of the Palestinians were killed while perpetuating terrorism. The only time it mentions terrorism is to criticize those who have “shamefully link[ed]” critics of Israel “to terrorism.”
It condemns Israel for actions that make difficult “the prospect of a two-state solution.” Are they unaware that the founders and leaders of the BDS movement oppose the two-state solution?
It is hard to know whether this editorial suffers more from ignorance or bigotry. It could have been written by a spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority, except that the PA would be a lot fairer. Its president does not support boycotting Israel!
Were this editorial submitted as a course paper, it would deserve a grade of C- — with grade inflation. Not for its points of view, but for its lack of honesty and selective presentation and omission of facts.
Even for those who oppose Israel’s policies, this editorial is an embarrassment. Its claim that it was written to balance “the overwhelming power imbalance that constricts the ongoing debate” is nothing less than a subtle nod to the antisemitic canard of Jewish power.
It takes no courage on campuses to oppose Israel’s existence. It takes great courage today to tell the complex truth about the history of the Israeli/Palestine conflict, which begins with the refusal of the Palestinian leadership to accept the two-state solution proposed by the United Nations. But ignorance and lack of courage are no excuse for anti-Semitism. This editorial is part of the oldest prejudice in its newest form. Shame!

To the editors:
I was president of The Crimson in 1973, nearly 50 years ago. I agree entirely with your superb editorial endorsing the nonviolent Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) campaign, designed to promote justice in Israel/Palestine.
At the same time, I salute Crimson editors who disagreed with the editorial, and who published their dissenting views. It takes courage to speak out when you are in the minority.
Our editorial board addressed some of the same issues during the 1973 Yom Kippur/Ramadan war between Israel and certain Arab states. I support BDS because I don't want to see another 50 years pass before all the peoples in the region can live in peace and justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students staged a series of rallies about abortion this week in response to a report that the Supreme Court is on the brink of striking down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision.
In response to a leaked draft majority opinion that would end guaranteed legal access to abortion, around 100 students demonstrated in support of abortion rights outside Memorial Church Wednesday. At the same time, a smaller group representing Harvard Right to Life, an anti-abortion student organization, gathered nearby in counterprotest. The two groups faced off at points, waving posters and heckling each other.
On Thursday afternoon, more than 50 students congregated on the steps of Widener Library as part of a national walkout in support of abortion rights. Roughly 30 anti-abortion demonstrators gathered across the aisle of the steps. The two sides chanted and waved signs, garnering a crowd of onlookers and Securitas patrol.
The protests come after Politico published a leaked draft majority opinion showing that the court voted to strike down Roe v. Wade, a landmark 1973 decision protecting the right to abortion access nationwide. The draft, penned by Associate Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., sent shockwaves across the country. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76 confirmed the draft’s authenticity, though he said the decision is not yet finalized.
At Wednesday’s rally, abortion rights protesters held signs that bore the phrases “Pro Life = Pro Death” and “Reproductive Rights are Human Rights.” Some students delivered speeches sharing their frustration and anger at the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned.
“For basic humanity, for the future of our nation, we must raise our voices and make sure our government knows that this is not what we want,” Hea Pushpraj ’25 said in a speech on Wednesday. “We must all stand together to ensure federal protection and to make sure more states cannot follow Oklahoma and Texas.”
“The state of those states will not be the state of our nation,” Pushpraj said.
Elizabeth M. Benecchi ’25 said in an interview before Wednesday’s pro-abortion rights protest that the rally’s organizers were “really infuriated” and “really upset” by the leaked draft.
“Women have had access to safe abortion for the past 49 years without extensive government oversight, and we intend to keep it that way,” Benecchi said in a speech during the rally. “We as women have autonomy over our own bodies. We have the right to make our own decisions and we have the right to choose our own futures.”
Wednesday’s pro-abortion rights rally was organized by Ava K. Pallotta ’25, who said in an interview before the protest that she “broke down sobbing” upon learning that Roe v. Wade was likely to be overturned.
“I remember sitting there crying and being like, ‘God, I really hope somebody organizes a rally.’ And then I was like, ‘Why not me?’” Pallotta said. “That was the reason behind it, just hoping that people would want to get out and support, and the community response has been incredible.”
Protesters in the counterrally sang songs, including “America the Beautiful” and Justin Bieber’s “Baby” in an effort to drown out the pro-abortion rights speeches, while holding posters that read “Pro Life, Pro Peace” and “The Future is Anti-Abortion.”
Olivia L. Glunz ’25, co-president of Harvard Right to Life, said in an interview during Thursday’s protest that her organization’s goal was to share a “message of joy and hope.”
Ava Swanson ’24, the other co-president of Harvard Right to Life, said in an interview during Thursday’s protest that she was “really proud” that the protest was civil.
“A lot of people have never really encountered other pro-life students or students who are willing to say that they’re pro-life on this campus,” Glunz said. “It’s really important to say that we have a reason for what we believe, that this is a really beautiful message that we want to create a world in which every single human life is valued.”
Organizers from both sides expressed a desire to keep the protests civil and peaceful, even as tensions rose and protesters shouted chants at each other.
“My goal always is to make people feel safe and make sure no one gets hurt. So hopefully, everything remains peaceful,” said Pallotta, the abortion rights rally organizer. “Just as they have the right to organize, so do we.”
Though the Wednesday rally occurred during a downpour of rain, A.J. Yi ’25 said they thought the rally was “phenomenal.”
“This message can ripple out to a lot of people who look at Harvard students as a model of what advocacy should look like,” Yi said.
Katarzyna A. “Kasia” Zarzycka ’22-’23, who attended the abortion rights rally Wednesday, said she wished more students at the College realized the “gravity” of the situation.
“Students in this school have power — they will be the people who will be deciding about our life soon,” Zarzycka said. “It all starts here.”

Harvard College will combine four existing offices into a new Office of Student Services beginning July 1, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in a Tuesday email to Harvard affiliates.
The new office will combine the existing Accessible Education Office, the Housing Office, the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, and the Office of the Registrar. Current Registrar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael P. Burke will serve as the first dean of the OSS, per the announcement.
In the email, Khurana wrote that the four units “currently work close together” and their combination will help the College advance its goals of “organizational alignment.”
“By realigning these units, we will have the opportunity to synchronize interdependent functions and deadlines, create functionality that reduces logistical steps, and decrease the number of barriers for our students, faculty, and staff to navigate,” Khurana wrote.
The Accessible Education Office currently provides academic accommodations for students in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with disabilities, while the Office of the Registrar manages course registration, student records, and tuition billing. The new OSS will also encompass the Housing Office and the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, which includes the Community Council, the Administrative Board, and the Honor Council.
In anticipation of Burke’s departure, Harvard will announce a new FAS registrar soon, Khurana wrote. Burke has also served as interim leader of the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct since last summer.
In the email, Khurana thanked the staff of the four offices which will now fall under the OSS for their “extraordinary work,” citing the challenges of the pandemic over the past two years.
“I have the incredible privilege of regularly working with colleagues in each of these units, and I continue to draw inspiration from them every day,” Khurana wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Labor Relations Board denied a petition seeking to decertify 32BJ Service Employees International Union, the union representing around 300 contracted security workers at Harvard.
The petition, filed by longtime Harvard security guard Walter J. Terzano, charged that 32BJ failed to adequately represent its workers in contract negotiations.
In a dismissal letter sent to Terzano last week, the NLRB cited the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits it from certifying any security guards’ union that admits non-guards as members.
32BJ is affiliated with SEIU, the second-largest labor union in the country, which admits non-guards as members. In the dismissal letter, NLRB Regional Director Laura A. Sacks wrote that “mixed guard/non-guard unions are disqualified from taking advantage of” the NLRB’s union certification election process.
On Wednesday, Terzano filed an appeal asking for the case to be reviewed.
“The intent here is not to certify, but decertify, which is not addressed by the statute which was cited as cause for dismissal,” the appeal letter reads.
In an interview Monday, Terzano took aim at 32BJ, saying that more than one-third of union members signed onto the decertification effort.
“There’s nobody there for them,” he said of union members. “It’s a diseased organism that they cannot rely on for help because the union is there for the company, not for us.”
Bargaining committee member Arun K. Malik said most guards supported the decertification effort, but “all of those signatures are moot” because the petition sought to decertify a union that was not recognized by the NLRB as a bargaining unit for guards to begin with.
“You can’t decertify a union that has never been certified,” he said. “So the appeal would be: How can the union membership, if they don’t want that union, get rid of them?”
Terzano wrote in his appeal that Securitas “did not comply in good faith” in posting a notice of the petition, which is required by the NLRB.
The appeal states that the notices were often “disguised” or “handed out on a single sheet of paper, double sided print, which by definition prevented them from being posted and the ability to be ‘viewed simultaneously’ as required.”
“There’s a clear problem here,” Malik said. “A majority of guards signed the petition. They don’t want this union, and the company’s insisting that we have to have this union.”
Union spokesperson Amanda Torres-Price and Harvard University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment. Securitas did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay outlined the process the FAS will adopt to consider requests to remove the names or representations of individuals from its buildings, spaces, programs, or professorships in an email to FAS affiliates Thursday.
This process is guided by a December 2021 report by the Committee to Articulate Principles on Renaming, which called for the consideration of denaming requests to be “careful, painstaking, and laborious” and grounded “in history.” Gay’s Thursday email clarified FAS-specific principles for denaming and provided details about submitting denaming requests.
Any current FAS affiliate may submit a denaming request to the Secretary of the Faculty. In the upcoming academic year, there will be two deadlines for submitting requests, October 3 and March 1.
After each deadline, the Secretary will share submitted requests to the Docket Committee of the FAS Faculty Council and the Office of the General Counsel. At the recommendation of the Docket Committee, the FAS Dean and University President can appoint a review committee to evaluate a denaming request.
If the review committee rejects a denaming request, a similar request cannot be considered for five years except in “extraordinary circumstances when significant and consequential new information comes to light.”
Gay wrote in her Thursday email that the FAS denaming process will approach the school’s history with humility. She added that the decision to remove a name will be the product of “deep examination and learning” and that the choice to move forward with a request should not be based solely on the number of supporters behind it.
Gay also noted that action on a request will be subject to an “inclusive process” that solicits views across the school and aims to encourage “generous listening and substantive discussion.”
The FAS denaming process is the first of many initiatives Gay said the school will engage in to respond to the release of a landmark University report last week, which acknowledged the “integral” role slavery played in shaping the school.
The Crimson reported Tuesday on the names of historical figures whose legacies are honored through buildings, streets, professorships, and towns — memorializing the legacy of slavery and discrimination on Harvard’s campus.
In an email to the FAS last week, Gay wrote that the report and its findings bring “new urgency” to efforts already underway within the FAS, such as evolving the school’s visual culture, diversifying faculty and staff, and expanding undergraduate financial aid.
Gay said in a Wednesday interview with The Crimson that one of the first agenda items of the FAS Committee on Visual Culture and Signage — established in December 2021 at the recommendation of the FAS Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage — will be to engage with Harvard’s history and legacies of slavery.
“As you probably remember from the Visual Culture report, there have been these priority spaces that were identified as places that present real opportunities for visual renewal, so they’ll be spending part of the summer just beginning to tour those places and starting to have conversations about what visual renewal might look like in those spaces,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf apologized to students who have been negatively affected by an overhaul of the school’s admissions and financial aid departments in an interview Wednesday, but said the school “will be better off in the future” because of the change.
The Kennedy School restructured its enrollment services last summer, laying off seven employees as it merged its admissions and financial aid teams. Almost 20 students interviewed by The Crimson last month reported that services have declined markedly in the months since the change.
“We’re very sorry for the disruptions that have affected students,” Elmendorf said Wednesday, reiterating an apology first offered by the deans who oversee the new office.
“The transition has not been as smooth as we had hoped or planned,” he said. “But I am confident that we will be better off in the future than we were in the past.”
Elmendorf said the restructuring sought “to create a more effective admissions and financial aid process for the long term.”
“I think we’re building a team that will be more effective, but [that] doesn’t mean that there haven’t been dropped items along the way,” he said. “There have been, and that’s what we feel bad about.”
Elmendorf said the employees hired to staff the newly-merged office are “working very hard to try to minimize the number of calls that aren’t returned or paperwork that isn’t finished at the right time, and so on.”
“I think this team will do a terrific job,” Elmendorf said. “But it is taking them some time to settle in and to learn more of the system here.”
Nine current and former HKS staff members said Oliver Street — the assistant dean of enrollment services who oversaw the transition to the newly-merged offices — fostered a toxic work environment, The Crimson reported last month. Four employees said the concerns about Street were reported to the Kennedy School’s HR department.
“Oliver made a lot of important contributions to the school,” Elmendorf said. “But I’m not going to comment on his individual performance beyond that.”
Asked whether he knew of employees’ concerns about Street, Elmendorf declined to comment.
Street left the Kennedy School on Thursday after less than three years. Elmendorf credited him with helping to improve the racial diversity of HKS’ student body.
The search for a new assistant dean for enrollment services has not concluded, Elmendorf said.
“Our commitment to recruiting a diverse class is lasting,” Elmendorf said. “And [we’ll] be looking for the next assistant dean who can lead this effort most effectively.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 8, 2022 at 12:17 a.m.
Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Council members voted to fill four of six chair positions at their monthly meeting Wednesday night.
After a welcome from incoming council president Zachary Lim, the council discussed the status of special students, who study at GSAS without pursuing a degree program and must petition to join the student council. The council voted, with 85 percent in favor, to automatically include special students and visiting fellows among its members.
The remainder of the meeting was reserved for elections filling several chair positions.
The election for the chair of support — a role responsible for overseeing grants to GSAS students for research and conferences — was the most contested position, with 10 students running. Jonathan Boretsky, a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics, and Lena C. O’Flynn, a Ph.D. candidate in Medical Sciences, each received 39 percent of the vote. Ultimately, Lim decided to allow them to work as co-chairs for the upcoming academic year.
History Ph.D. candidate Oluwaseyi “Shae” Ominjo and Human Evolutionary Biology Ph.D. candidate Sophie A. Barton, running unopposed for the positions of treasurer and chair of communications, respectively, both won with overwhelming support.
Kody Christiansen, a student at the Harvard Extension School and in GSAS’ Special Students Program, ran for chair of recognition and won with 89 percent of the vote. He will be responsible for aiding the council’s acknowledgement of outstanding graduate students.
“A huge part of the GSC’s work is to recognize good work that is done in GSAS,” Lim said.
With no one running for chair of technology, the position will remain open until the fall.
The election for chair of advocacy, who serves as a liaison between GSAS students and administrators, featured just one contender —Sociology Ph.D. candidate Aaron Benavidez — but was marred by controversy.
In an initial vote, the council was split evenly between abstentions and votes in favor of Benavidez. Following a second vote, 53 percent of council members chose to abstain rather than elect him.
Lim alleged Benavidez has “a history” of dropping out of student organizations when student leaders have “overwhelmingly disagreed” with his advocacy positions. He added Benavidez then continued to advocate for the positions by himself.
“My concern is that, how are we to operate as a team if our chair of advocacy doesn't listen to the rest of us?” Lim said. “You think that that would be productive for our team?”
Benavidez responded that he believes individuals should have the discretion to take “reasonable” action on their own.
“I think there is room for advocacy that can be a part of conversation, but it sounds like there's also room for people to move forward in a direction that seems reasonable,” he said.
In an interview after the meeting, Benavidez criticized the election results, which he described as the “work of an oligarchy.”
“This didn't feel very democratic,” he said.
The position will remain open until the council holds additional elections in its first meeting this fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the stroke of midnight Wednesday, more than 100 Harvard students shed their clothes and inhibitions to take a naked lap around Harvard Yard.
Students — at varying levels of lucidity — gathered in front of Hollis Hall to begin the biannual streaking tradition, which marks the end of reading period. Primal Scream, which resumed last December after a three-semester hiatus, dates back to at least 1995 as a way for the boldest of undergraduates to let loose before finals.
Keeping with the tradition, this year’s participants carefully prepared for the race with drinks, chants, and music. The race got off to a sluggish start before the crowd recognized the sound of the Memorial Church bells as their cue to run.
Spring’s Primal Scream took place in nippy 50-degree weather, a far cry from last semester’s iteration which coincided with the first snowfall of the season.
Many students cited the stress of finals as their motivation to bare it all for the event.
“I’m dying,” Amar S. Boparai ’25 said. “Finals have been really hard.”
For Kali’inoa Maeva ’25, Primal Scream was a way to destress and take “time off to relax from all the anxieties and worries that come with finals.”
Other students were attracted to the tradition for the thrill.
“When else are you gonna go streaking through Harvard Yard? I guess, before every finals, but never again in your life,” said Margo A. Smith ’25.
Thursday’s throngs were dwarfed by last semester’s snowy streak, some students reported.
“It wasn't as good and there weren't as many people, but I still had a fun and awesome time,” Mavea said.
But this spring’s sprint had one advantage over its predecessor: The Harvard Band was present, pantless, and playing for the runners for the first time in over two years. The band was unable to attend last semester’s Primal Scream due to a scheduling conflict.
Cole Cleary ’25, a Primal Scream veteran, said he had not initially planned on participating this semester but got “taken away” by the enthusiasm of the band and onlookers.
“You could just feel the energy coming from right in front of that dorm,” Cleary said.
Other students reported similar enchanting effects.
“I feel like every semester everybody goes ‘Nah, I'm not going to do Primal Scream,’ but at the end of the day, they always end up out here,” Boparai said.
Some students criticized their peers for stopping short of full nudity — a recurring debate of great contention.
Cleary was “disappointed” when he realized his roommates had retained some articles of clothing for the run. He found it “kind of soft.”
“But you know what? Not everybody can be a winner,” he said.
Some students decried the gaggles of onlookers who remained fully clothed and recorded the runners.
Liudmila Budaragina, a tourist, said she heard about the event from a show and “thought it would be fun to go.”
Jessica J. Zhang ’25 said she “felt a little creeped out by people who come to watch naked teenagers.”
“Especially those who take flash photography,” Zhang added.
Mariam Hamdi, another spectator, said her reasons for watching the tradition are clear.
“You know, it’s to see people who have the best education doing some weird stuff. I’m very excited to see that,” Hamdi said.
