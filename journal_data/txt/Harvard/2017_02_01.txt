After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The consistent failure of the Harvard Management Company to meet both internal and external benchmarks is finally inspiring reform. Last year’s significant loss will have unwanted effects on the University’s budget, and a professional analysis of the company’s management and structure strongly suggests that the company’s consistent underperformance is avoidable. We are relieved that Harvard is finally breaking from the problematic status quo in a drastic overhaul of past investment practices and company management. If Harvard cannot at least match the financial success of peer institutions, it cannot expect to keep its role as a leader in research and higher education.
Harvard’s endowment is the largest in the world, and the magnitude of its portfolio should not be underestimated. Last year’s negative 2 percent return amounted to a loss of $2 billion dollars, which cut into both endowment size and the University’s operational budget. This loss represents the first since the 2009 financial crisis. While this was a tough financial year, there is no denying that HMC fell short. The internal benchmark was a positive return of 1 percent, and the company’s failure to reach it is nothing new. Neither can HMC’s underperformance be adequately explained away by external factors, given that peer institutions like Yale and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were able to achieve positive returns in spite of the same challenges or at least smaller losses.
Much of the evidence points to a need for serious change. In a critical examination of HMC, the consulting firm McKinsey and Co. found that money managers were taking home large bonuses for exceeding easy targets. Between 2009 and 2014, manager compensation soared and 11 money managers took home $242 million in just five years. Over 90 percent of this sum of money was made up of bonuses that appeared to be awarded when managers exceeded large, moving targets. HMC employees themselves described management to McKinsey as “lazy, fat, [and] stupid.” Even so, the board overseeing HMC failed to tighten standards or more critically survey the situation.
HMC's recent investment strategy—an expensive series of mistakes for the past few years—will finally face a set of justified reforms. Unlike the rest of its peers, HMC has historically used a “hybrid” model for investment, in which both a large internal staff and external money managers are used. Internal staff are responsible for specific portfolios rather than the overall endowment, and the organization of these staff members is complex. Other universities have long been using only external money managers, whose expertise and competitiveness are hard to parallel.
As a commendable yet difficult first step, HMC’s new CEO, N.P. Narvekar, a past manager of the Columbia endowment, will be moving Harvard in the direction of more competitive peer institutions. Half of the 230-person staff will be laid off by the end of the year and those who remain will have their compensation tied to sustained, overall endowment growth rather than the short-term success of their single department.
These changes are dramatic, but they will shift HMC towards a model that has brought success to other universities. We are optimistic that this change will ameliorate the stagnations and losses of the past and put Harvard back on a financial path that will allow the University to uphold the highest standards of education and research.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Duty. Honor. Country. One of my teammates added “ugh.” I half-chuckled at her as we walked past the West Point motto emblazoned on the fence of the academy’s rugby pitch, two brisk Novembers ago. Surely she was joking and did not genuinely mean to deride the mission of the venerable United States Military Academy. I turned to her quizzically and the joke was on me. “It’s just … ugh.” We lost 58-21 to the black- and gold-clad cadets.
Around a year later, I made the mistake of logging into Facebook on the morning of Nov. 9, 2016, which was especially ill-advised after 0630 ROTC physical training at the MIT track. “I am ashamed to be an American.” “As an American, this is embarrassing.” And so forth. I was prepared to encounter anger, outrage, confusion, and grief that day, but I was not expecting to encounter what I felt was nothing short of … unpatriotic. I went about my day as incensed and hurt as some of my classmates, but for entirely different reasons.
That said, frat-house chants of “USA! USA! USA!”, prominent personal displays of various permutations of the U.S. flag, and a great affinity for firearms don’t epitomize patriotism either. There are YouTube channels dedicated to exposing supposed “patriots” who fashion themselves to be members of the U.S. military and wear the uniform (usually wildly incorrectly) to try to pass themselves off as service members. That’s not patriotism, that’s stolen valor.
For some of us, loving this country is pretty straightforward, with tangible commitments and connections to service and sacrifice. For others, their relationship to their American identity is one that can be filled with questioning and doubt even while acknowledging the brighter parts of being American, especially in light of recent executive orders on refugees and immigrants. There is room on the patriotic spectrum for both kinds of people.
My teammate has valid criticisms of the U.S. military, but I know she’ll stand up and cheer when I commission as a U.S. Army Officer in two years. I know that (I hope) most of the Facebook users who exhorted such seemingly un-American sentiments over the last few months aren’t planning on pulling up stakes and abandoning their lives in the United States. Surely, Americans divided along the patriotic spectrum must be united by something more deeply ingrained and profound than outward differences.
Maybe we can take a page out of retired Marine General John F. Kelly’s book. During his confirmation hearings for Secretary of Homeland Security, someone dared to suggest to him outside the chamber that he should wear an American flag on his lapel. General Kelly served over 40 years in the Marine Corps, including deployments for Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom. Robert Kelly, his son, was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2010.
No one of sound mind could accuse Gen. Kelly of being anything less than a true patriot, regardless of his lapel, considering the sacrifices he has made and decorated service he has rendered to this country. He certainly doesn’t need to wear an American flag to prove his patriotism to anyone. He replied very simply to the misguided suggestion with all the steeliness and brevity befitting the stars he used to wear on his uniform: “No, I am an American flag.”
Herein lies the problem. We’ve allowed identity markers to color our views of what is and isn’t patriotic. Political affiliation, occupation, race, gender, religion, immigration status, gun ownership, socioeconomic status—we fixate on checkboxes, which we imagine tells us everything we need to know about those “other” people. Behold how accusingly the Midwestern Republican assumes that the elite college-educated protestor despises American tradition, and with what moral snobbery the secular coastal elite sneers at the “uneducated masses” in flyover country who “cling” to their guns and religion in the name of American freedom.
“American” ought to outweigh superficial demographic markers. The first-generation college student, their immigrant parents, the soldier who enlists out of high school, even the protestor—they are all American flags in their own right. Despite appearances to the contrary, American values and principles unite us more often than they divide us.
Words (and Facebook posts) alone don’t prove or disprove our patriotism. Our hearts and our actions are the true measures of our patriotism, whether or not we even choose to call ourselves “patriot.” Real patriotism reflects gratitude and dedication to making this country truly great. That can take so many different forms.
We must look beyond politics. Patriotism doesn’t depend on who the president is, which party controls Congress, or which policies are implemented. True patriotism runs deeper, withstands the test of time, and doesn’t waver with changes in the national scene. Real patriotism can acknowledge and work to fix flaws in our country while still finding ample cause to be grateful. Every American can find something about the United States to celebrate. Not everyone will bother to try, but everyone can.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My family left Sudan for the United States when I was five years old. The majority of my extended family remain in Sudan, and five years have passed since I last saw them. I had planned to reunite with some of them at my graduation in just a few months. I wanted my grandmother—who married at age 12, became a mother at 13, and never had the opportunity to learn to read—to watch her granddaughter receive a medical degree from Harvard. I wanted to share a few days of American life with my Sudanese cousins who I know often wish to stand in my place, in my shoes, on American soil. I won’t hide my disappointment at the new impossibility of these wishes. But my feelings are merely a sting relative to the profound heartbreak and despair of the many more people who thought they had finally found refuge from war, sickness, and economic repression in this country.
On Oct. 3, 2016 at 1 a.m., I wrote to President Obama. In breaks between studying, I had Googled images of Omran Daqnees, the silent Syrian boy bleeding in the back an ambulance. For the next hour I was transfixed. My heart broke for the White Helmets, a motley crew of blacksmiths and teachers who quit their trades to dig their people out of rubble because no one else would.
Exasperated by the obvious vacuum of need and upset by our strong and capable country’s refusal to fill it, I went to the White House website and shared my feelings with the leader of the free world. A month later, I received an email from the White House requesting my mailing address. A few weeks after I was holding a letter that bore President Obama’s signature. It read:
“Thousands of Syrians—including many young children—face hardships and struggles that are unimaginable, and like you, I recognize that our Nation has an obligation to act. That is why the United States has helped lead the effort to mobilize aid for refugees, and it is why we have committed to accepting more refugees from around the world. We have also stepped up as the largest donor of assistance, providing $4.5 billion in aid since the start of the conflict. Please know I will continue doing everything I can to help those in need and ensure America remains what it has always been—a beacon of hope to all who seek it.”
Excited as I was to receive mail from President Obama (or his aides), I was severely disappointed by the response. Miffed by the letter’s defensive tone, I thought, clearly he doesn’t see that we should be doing more. We should be accepting more refugees.
Now that Trump has brandished his executive authority to ban refugees and migrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, I can only feel two great ironies when I think back on that letter. This first is my assured assumption that America’s empathy was only capable of growing, not withering. I never considered—as a true possibility—that our country would take action to effectively extinguish the beacon of hope this country represents. The second irony is that our new President would reject not only Syrian refugees, but my own Sudanese family, too.
When I told my cousins in Sudan about President Obama’s response, they begged me to send another letter asking him to do away with US sanctions against Sudan. Omar Al Bashir, the President of Sudan, is an autocrat who came into power through a military coup d’état and remained President for over 27 years. The grievances against him are long and include genocide in Darfur that lead to a warrant for his arrest by the International Criminal Court in 2009.
The United States has rhetorically reprimanded Omar Al Bashir, but it is the Sudanese people who have had to suffer on his behalf. Many have died trying to protest against him. Decades of trade embargos and restrictions as well as pervasive government corruption have lead to rampant inflation that translated to everyday hardships for the working class in Sudan.
The heartbreaking stories of the Syrian people and the Sudanese people is all too similar to those of Iraqi, Libyan, Somalian, Iranian, and Yemeni people.  The theme is clear: entire nations of people must suffer for the actions of the few and powerful. Another theme also exists: America is the safe haven that is most sought-after by these people. President Obama was correct about that in his letter; America has always been a “beacon of hope for all who seek it.”
Millions worldwide want to migrate to the United States. The American Dream ethos that captivates and elicits longing in the hearts of so many people around the world is not of achieving tremendous wealth or power; it’s a basic yearning for the stability of a home address, the satisfaction of a full belly, the peace of mind of a routine primary care visit, and the guarantee of human rights.
As Americans, we sometimes take our privileges for granted, so much so that we can’t see that America is already great. We have been so hardened by the actions of a few, that we believe entire nations of people despise us. This could not be further from the truth. Refugees love our country more than we do and theirs is the ultimate unrequited love.

This January marks the return of professor Cornel West—black philosopher, political theorist, activist, author, and democratic socialist—to Harvard University. On Jan. 25, West delivered a fiery speech titled “The Trump Era: Hope in a Time of Escalating Despair,” in which he decried neoliberalism and neo-fascism, invoked the spirits of preeminent black activists, and urged listeners to become “warriors” in the next four years. After his speech, West spoke with Fifteen Minutes to tell us about his thoughts, plans, and hopes for the semester.
FM: This issue is about new beginnings. You’re coming back to Harvard after 17 years. Why did you decide to come back?
CW: Well, I had already retired from Princeton, I had already retired from Union Seminary, and I got married and my wife is in Boston, and I said, “maybe I can still be of some use to an institution in the Boston area.” And of course there’s no institution of higher learning in the Boston area that I love more than my own Harvard, that shaped me in so many ways. And I was talking before about Martin Kilson, Preston Williams, Israel Scheffler, Robert Nozick, Stanley Cavell and so many others who mean the world to me. So when the possibility [of returning] became real, I salute[d] the President, I salute[d] the Provost for being open to bringing me back.
FM: In your colloquium speech, you talked about the importance of being “a hope” rather than just having hope. So what does that mean to you, here and now, in 2017, as a Harvard University professor?
CW: It is profoundly Aristotelian... It’s a matter of embodying and enacting a certain kind of virtues. It’s not just a matter of having a discourse. It’s a way of life. It’s a mode of being in the world. Now as a Christian, for me, it’s primarily faith, hope, and love. But I take very seriously other traditions as well—secular traditions, religious traditions of the east and what have you. It’s a matter of choosing to be a certain kind of human being before you die. And it has to be in your practice, it has to be in your habits, in your deeds, in your actions—Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel is one of the great figures for me in my own life, and he always talked about deeds, deeds, deeds. Deeds of kindness, deeds of truth telling, deeds of witness bearing for justice. And I take that very seriously.
FM: In your speech when you were talking about different values, I heard integrity come up a lot. Why is integrity so important to you?
CW: In a market-driven culture in which everyone’s up for sale and everything is up for sale, integrity cuts up against the grain. And I think integrity is one of the perennial aspirations of those who want to live a moral life. We need it badly. There’s no ideological monopoly on integrity. Integrity comes from the right, the center, the left, the Christian, non-Christian, Jewish, non-Jewish—it’s a profoundly human thing. Now, it’s true that I’m very much of the left in terms of my politics, but I have great respect for persons of integrity no matter what their politics are.
FM: And you’re teaching two classes at the University this semester.
CW: One at the Law School, American Democracy with Roberto Unger, my dear brother, and then the course on DuBois at the Divinity School.
FM: Why did you choose those two courses?
CW: I taught the course with Roberto Unger in the ‘90s—we actually wrote a book together on American Democracy and I figured well, what timing, given the Trump Era, American Democracy, perfect. And with DuBois I wanted to start off with [him] given his unbelievable status.
Spotting his colleague and friend Brandon Terry from afar, West shouts, “Stay strong, Brother Brandon!” and departs from our interview for “Just one second.” For a few minutes, onlookers smile, stare, and chatter eagerly at the sight of West. He exclaims, “I’m blessed to be here! I’m blessed to be here!” In response, a woman shouts, “We enjoy your blessing!”
FM: I see you’re pressed for time. Our magazine is called Fifteen Minutes, so could you could give us a fifteen second briefing on the class American Democracy? What do our readers need to know?
CW: They need to know that we’re wrestling with Alexis de Tocqueville, we’re wrestling with the challenges of W.E.B. DuBois, we’re wrestling with the challenges of our feminists, anti-homophobic thinkers trying to make America more free and more democratic. And it is being done in the early moments of the neo-fascist era of Donald Trump.
FM: And on DuBois’ political philosophy?
CW: With DuBois, you’re just dealing with a genius and a giant from social science to art to history to sociology. There’s been nobody like him and reading him, you’re reading the history of the American empire.
FM: I want to go back to your hopes. What are your hopes for your return to Harvard?
CW: To keep alive a great tradition of those who tell the truth and bear witness to justice. We have Martin Kilson, such a towering figure, the first black tenured professor at Harvard. And to pass it on to the younger generation, you got figures like brother Brandon Terry who is just brilliant and part of the same tradition. For me, to be just one conduit or vehicle is a beautiful thing.
FM: You also talked about the importance of finding your cause. What is your hope for student activists and Harvard students who haven’t yet found their cause?
CW: I want them to find their voice, which is a calling, and to find [their] cause—but each one, each individual has to choose. I can’t do it for other individuals. But that’s part of what it is to have integrity: to be able to be true to yourself.
FM: Have there been any major changes in your thinking since you were last at Harvard 17 years ago?
CW: No, just more fortified to tell the truth and speak for justice, but it’s the same. I got to run! One more.
FM: Any parting words that you would like to say?
CW: I would just say to the younger generation that you all, if you so choose, can be tied to a great tradition of excellence that’s linked to justice and that in your learning, you can be forces for good, then you pass on [that tradition] to the next generation.

University President Drew G. Faust convened a panel of some of the country’s most prominent journalists to discuss the industry’s future in Sanders Theatre Tuesday, five days after President Donald Trump referred to the media as the “opposition party.”
Journalists and Harvard affiliates packed Sanders for the event, titled “The Future of News: Journalism in a Post-Truth Era” and co-sponsored by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism. Featured journalists took an introspective look at the purpose of their work and the obligations of journalists in the age of Trump.
In her opening address, Faust emphasized the need for universities and journalists to continue the “pursuit of truth,” calling this mission a “subject of greatest urgency.”
“Like journalists, we regard facts as the necessary foundation for human decision-making and human progress,” Faust said. “Yet we now confront what has been called a post-truth era.”
Nieman Foundation curator Ann Marie Lipinski moderated a panel of editors of major national publications. Wall Street Journal editor-in-chief Gerard Baker, Huffington Post editor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen, and New York Times columnist and editorial editor David Leonhardt explored “the erosion of trust” in the media and made sense of Trump’s ascension to power.
Much of the panel's discussion focused on word choices media outlets make to characterize Trump’s policies and public statements, specifically whether or not publications should label Trump’s false claims as “lies.” Leonhardt argued that the media should use the term “lie” conservatively, as opposed to words like “untruth” or “falsehood.”
“I think the key is to remember that if you are putting the falsehood out there, and then saying in the six paragraphs that it’s false, you’re not doing your job,” Leonhardt said.
Baker responded to questions about a recent email to Wall Street Journal editors in which he challenged their use of the phrase “Muslim majority countries” in stories about Trump’s 90-day ban on immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan,  Syria, Somalia, and Yemen. During the panel, Baker said he did not specifically forbid the phrase, but requested that his reporters provide additional context in their stories.
“This phrase ‘Muslim ban’ has been thrown around. It’s not a Muslim ban,” Baker said. “We do need to be very careful about that language, and we need to be very precise.”
The panelists also discussed the divide between the media and the audiences they seek to serve in an often self-critical examination of their own publications’ reach and the place of the media in American society.
“I actually think that what we're seeing right now is a collapse of empathy in journalism,” Polgreen said. “I feel as though journalism has become a highly elite profession that feels extremely distant from the experiences of the people that we write about.”
Baker argued that the distance stems from a cultural gap between many journalists who largely live in cities and attend elite universities—including Ivy League institutions like Harvard—and Trump supporters in other parts of the country.
But panelists said they remained optimistic about the journalism’s future, particularly as social media continues to make journalism more accessible and participatory for readers around the world.
“There really are some positives from this,” Leonhardt said. “You have your own printing press.”
A number of journalists spoke before and after the panel, including Lolly Bowean of the Chicago Tribune, William Kristol ’73 of The Weekly Standard, Kathleen Kingsbury of The Boston Globe, and Brian Stelter of CNN.
In a call to action, Stelter concluded the event by proclaiming that this is a critical moment for journalists everywhere.
“This is it. This is the time journalists live for,” Stelter said. “It’s only a post-truth world if we all in this room let it be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s endowment grew slower than was average for endowments at American colleges and universities in fiscal year 2016, according to a recent report from the National Association of College and Business Officers.
The report found that the national average for endowment returns for higher educational institutions in fiscal year 2016 was negative 1.9 percent—a marked decrease from the positive 2.4 percent universities returned on average in fiscal year 2015.  In fiscal year 2016, Harvard returned negative 2 percent on its investments, the worst the University has returned since the height of the financial crisis in 2009.
The release of the study—which aggregates endowment data from over 800 colleges and universities across the country—comes just a week after N.P Narvekar, the new chief of Harvard’s investment arm, announced sweeping changes to the University’s unique investment model. Among other actions, Harvard Management Company will cut the firm’s workforce in half and eliminate most of its internal money management teams.
Despite lackluster returns nationwide, the report notes that schools continued to increase the annual payout from the endowment to annual operating budgets in fiscal year 2016, a trend which the association’s CEO John D. Walda described as “a cause for concern.”
“Continued below-average investment returns will undoubtedly make it much more difficult for colleges and universities to support their missions in the future,” Walda wrote in an executive summary of the association’s report.
In fiscal year 2016, HMC allocated approximately $1.7 billion of its endowment towards the University’s operating budget, contributing to an overall decline in the value of the endowment from $37.6 billion to $35.7 billion.
Typically, most institutions must earn about 7.4 percent on their investments annually in order to maintain the level of endowment money they spend, according to the report. Last year, after Harvard’s endowment returns became public, University President Drew G. Faust said the poor returns would likely constrain Harvard’s budgets for years to come.
Charles A. Skorina, who manages a financial executive search firm, said that “most universities have not done as good a job as they should in controlling their budgets.”
“Harvard was irrationally exuberant a few years ago over what they could fund, thinking the money pot in their endowment would just keep growing,” Skorina said.
William F. Jarvis, the executive director of the Commonfund Institute, charged universities with balancing the long and short term demands of their budgets “at the governance level” in order to maintain the services they offer students—financial aid, research opportunities, among others—in perpetuity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than 10 hours of negotiation Monday, Harvard and the the University’s smallest union reached a new contract agreement, ending months of contract negotiations for security, parking, and museum guards.
The group’s new contract includes higher pay for the lower half of union members, as well as benefits that allow extra personal days. Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards Union, which has approximately 80 members, has been in negotiations with the University since June 30, when HUSPMGU’s contract expired. A federal mediator was present at Monday’s negotiations.
“We believe that this agreement serves well the interests of both the represented employees as well as that of the University, and we are hopeful for a ratification,” University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement.
According to deLuzuriaga, the agreement includes an 3.14 percent increase in average annualized wages, as well as “acceptance of the University’s Active and Post Retiree health plans, and agreement on a mechanism to facilitate coverage for extra functions at the Harvard Art Museums.”
Union organizer Curt E. Rheault praised the pay raise that the new contract grants to HUSPMGU's low wage workers.
“Our goal was to bring up our lowest wage earners,” Rheault said. “Harvard was in agreement on that—our lowest wage earners were too low and we should fix that problem.”
Rheault also said that the union’s new contract will help members afford Harvard’s health care plan. He said that he worried that, under the union’s old contract, the union’s lowest paid workers struggled to afford healthcare.
“We still have a long way to go but we helped the lowest tier on wages and the effect that healthcare was going to have on them,” he said. “Everything else was secondary.”
“Any fee on a lower paid worker, it kills,” Rheault added.
According to Rheault, under the recent agreement with Harvard, union workers will receive a $275 flexible spending account to help offset the cost of medical co-pays.
“Harvard was once again willing to work with us and the main thing was they were able to help us offset the costs of medical care,” he said.
Although Rheault praised the benefits that HUSPMGU’s new contract guarantees for workers, he said that the group’s benefits were still worse than other unions’.
“We’re still going to be the lowest paid people at Harvard, but Harvard and us had an agreement where we’re still gaining ground on other unions,” Rheault said.
Responding to the claim that HUSPMGU was Harvard’s lowest paid union, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote, “HUSPMGU's proposed wage increase is consistent with other represented groups on campus. Hourly rates and benefits are competitive, and at times exceed, those for parking and museum attendants across the Greater Boston area.
In order to ratify the contract, union members must vote to adopt the terms of Harvard and HUSPMGU’s agreement. Rheault and other union organizers will present the proposed terms of the contract to the union on Monday. Union members will vote on Tuesday.

Harvard’s wealth has grown at a slower rate than that of its peer institutions in the past five years, a brief report from Moody’s Investors Service recently found.
The University’s wealth—the sum of its cash holdings and investments—has grown at a rate of 8.8 percent over the past five years, according to the report, lagging significantly behind the median wealth growth of 22 percent for peer institutions.
The Moody’s report compares Harvard’s wealth growth with other American colleges and universities with similar credit ratings. Harvard—which remains the wealthiest university in the world, with a $35.7 billion endowment—received an AAA credit rating from the organization in fiscal year 2016.
“Harvard's significant wealth, and the liquidity and operating flexibility it provides, are key factors driving the university's exceptional credit quality,” the report states. “Preservation of that wealth is especially important given the university’s 40% reliance on endowment spending to support its operating budget and strategic initiatives.”
The report attributes the relatively weak growth in wealth to Harvard’s capital investments, debt repayment, and swap terminations, as well as the endowment’s struggling performance. In fiscal year 2016, Harvard returned negative two percent on its endowment, as opposed to the median negative 0.9 percent returns for peers in its credit-rating bracket, according to the report.
Moody’s assessment comes a week after Harvard Management Company’s CEO N.P Narvekar—less than two months into his tenure as the investment arm’s head—announced extensive changes to HMC’s investment strategies. HMC will lay off nearly half of its 230 person internal staff by the end of 2017 and outsource most of its investments to external managers by the end of the fiscal year, changes Narvekar said will streamline the firm.
In a message to Harvard affiliates, Narvekar said he expects the changes to HMC’s investment strategy and internal structure to be a “five-year process.”
“While I believe HMC’s investment performance will be challenged in fiscal year 2017, by the end of the calendar year the organization will look and act very differently than it does today,” he wrote. “It is also likely that our organization will experience more changes before we have completed our multi-year transformation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 1, 2017 at 12:33 p.m.
Two Iranian sisters on their way to research at Harvard were denied entry to the United States this weekend, bringing the total number of Harvard affiliates barred from the country due to President Donald Trump’s immigration order to at least four.
Amene and Marzieh Asgari, who planned to study at Harvard Medical School and in the Philosophy department respectively, were twice prevented from boarding flights to Boston on Sunday, and twice again on Monday.
The Asgari sisters’ rejection came after Iranian researchers Seyed S. S. Saravi and Samira Asgari, who is not related to Amene and Marzieh, were barred from flying to the United States Saturday to conduct research at Harvard.
“My whole future is basically in the hands of this executive order, my dream job, my future, my everything,” Amene said in an interview with her sister Tuesday. “I think it’s truly unfair, I do hope that either Trump changes his mind or other Senators can do something.”
Trump’s executive order halts immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days and suspends entry for Syrian refugees indefinitely. The policy sparked demonstrations and lawsuits around the United States over the weekend, including in Harvard Square, where student activists held an ‘emergency protest’ Friday.
Marzieh said she does not understand why Trump’s immigration policy would target her family.
“If the administration wants to fight terrorism, it’s fair, it’s excellent, but why are we being targeted? We are just citizens, normal citizens,” she said. “We left Iran for a better, freer life, not for this.”
“This is not the America we know,” Marzieh added.
The two were slated to start work at Harvard in early February—Amene was to perform mathematical modelling for the Medical School, while Marzieh was going to conduct research under Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall. Both originally planned to fly to the United States sometime in the next two weeks.
After Trump signed the immigration order Friday, Amene received an email from Medical School administrators urging her to “come immediately,” she said. She and Marzieh booked flights to the United States Sunday afternoon out of Heathrow Airport in London.
When the Asgari sisters arrived at the airport, Marzieh’s two-year-old daughter Sophie in tow, an official from the United States Department of Homeland Security refused to let the sisters on a plane to Boston, though both said they had valid visas. Amene and Marzieh tried to rebook their flight to Boston three times over the next 48 hours, each time without success.
“[The official] said, ‘Look, I don’t take any joy in doing this, but I have to follow my government’s order,’” Marzieh said. “‘So don’t reserve your ticket for tomorrow or another day or another day, just go.’”
Amene and Marzieh, who said they were “exhausted” at this point, headed home with Sophie to Glasgow, Scotland. Amene, who is living in the United Kingdom on a student visa, said she is fearful for the future.
Her visa will expire on April 30, she said. If Amene is unable to enter the United States before then, she said she will have to return to Iran, where she fears she will face difficulties with the government.
“I have been a children rights activist since my early twenties,” Amene wrote in an email. “Rights activities are frowned upon (to put it mildly) by the Iranian regime… Considering my activities, there is no guarantee I can leave Iran [once I return].”
Amene’s other sister Mahboubeh Asgari-Targhi, who works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said she is also concerned for Amene’s wellbeing should she travel to Iran.
“Considering that Amene has been a human rights activist, I am worried what will happen to her once she returns to Iran,” Mahboubeh said. “Our hope was that she could come to Harvard and continue her research. This is just devastating.”
Reflecting on the past three days, Marzieh said there was one moment in particular she kept reliving in her head. Just after she and Amene learned they would be unable to board their flight to Boston, Marzieh said, she remembered going to collect Sophie from the children’s play area.
“My daughter was running at the airport and I was trying to catch her, she was running up and down because she thought I was trying to play with her,” Marzieh said. “It was very sweet, but also sad.”
Amene interrupted her sister.
“People didn’t seem to realize, yes, we are scientists,” she said. “But also we were just two women with a toddler.”

Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics” is the most popular course in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for the fourth consecutive spring, beating out the second-largest class—Life Sciences 1b: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution”—by a hefty margin of about 150 students.
As of Tuesday, the introductory economics course had 571 students enrolled, while introductory biology course Life Sciences 1b had 414 enrollees. The numbers are relatively consistent with enrollment in these courses in the past: last spring, Economics 10b was slightly larger with 578 students, while Life Sciences 1b was smaller with 400 students.
Some students said they were drawn to the two courses because they provide a foundation for future concentrations.
“I’m considering pre-med and [Life Sciences 1b] is a prerequisite, so I’m taking the class so I don’t rule it out. I also took a lot of AP Science courses, so it’s been kind of a continuation of that,” Simone R. Dreux ’20 said.
Rounding out the top five courses were Culture and Belief 23: “From the Hebrew Bible to Judaism, From the Old Testament to Christianity,” with 371 total enrollees, Computer Science 51: “Introduction Computer Science II”, with 354, and Science of Living Systems 19: “Nutrition and Global Health,” with 351.
“I hope I will be able to teach the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament to Christianity to a larger number of students,” said Shaye J. D. Cohen, a religion professor who teaches Culture and Belief 23. “I’m unhappy in the sense that it gives me more work.“
Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics,” the top-enrolled class in spring 2013, came in sixth place this year with 336 total students.
Societies of the World 54: “Islam and Politics in the Modern Middle East,” taught by Islamic studies professor Malika Zeghal, saw a dramatic spike in enrollment this spring. Enrollment in the lotteried course increased by 127 percent from the last time it was offered in the fall of 2015, growing from 37 to 84 students.
“We always expect a large number of students to be interested in this course on Islam and Politics in the Modern Middle East, since the topic speaks to contemporary major issues and events related to the political role of Islam in the Middle East and beyond,” Zeghal wrote in an email.
Students have until Feb. 21 to add or drop courses, and until Feb. 6 to do so without a fee.

Hundreds of Harvard Medical School affiliates have signed a petition calling on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to relocate a Feb. 18  fundraiser away from President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
Since 2011, Dana-Farber, a Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital, has hosted its annual “Discovery Celebration” fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, paying the Trump foundation $150,000 each year. After Trump's  executive order on immigrants and refugees, however, a group of Medical School students sent an email Sunday night to Dana-Farber President Laurie H. Glimcher and Senior Vice President for Development Susan S. Paresky urging them to “immediately relocate” the fundraiser.
After initially receiving no response, students started a petition on Monday, which has gathered over 1,000 signatures from doctors, Medical School students, and Dana-Farber affiliates opposed to the event’s venue.
“It takes work to do this well and to do this thoughtfully, but it did not take much convincing at all to ask people to sign on to this,” Colleen M. Farrell, an organizer, said. “It was really quite easy to mobilize concern and get people involved.”
The petition describes Trump’s executive order as a threat to refugees, patients, and healthcare professionals, pointing to at least two Med School affiliates’ recent inability to enter the United States as a result of the order. Trump's order suspends immigration from seven predominantly majority Muslim countries, among other measures.
The Medical School petition argues that as an “integral institution of the Harvard Community and a global leader in cancer care and research,” Dana-Farber should fundraise in a way that reflects its commitment to diversity.
“By relocating the Discovery Celebration fundraiser, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute will demonstrate its core values to the nation, to the medical community, and most importantly, to patients.” the petition adds.
On Tuesday afternoon, Glimcher responded to the petition's organizers, writing that the fundraiser will go on as planned.
"Cancer knows no national boundaries, and we share your concern about the effect of the new executive order on immigration on our staff and patients," Gimcher wrote. But Glimcher noted that a “large number of people have committed to attend  the event."
“Cancelling the event outright would only deny much-needed resources for research and care,” she added.
George Karandinos, one of the petition's organizers, said he and other students plan to continue petitioning and communicating with Dana-Farber in the hopes of relocating the event.
“We’re obviously incredibly disappointed with [Glimcher’s] response, but we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to initiate a respectful dialogue with her and work towards a happy conclusion,” Karandinos said.
Farrell also said she respects Dana-Farber’s efforts in cancer research and stressed that the petition’s purpose “is not at all to decrease the funds” of the organization.
“We don’t want Dana-Farber to lose fundraising money because of this, but we also feel strongly that the way they go about fundraising has to be in line with their core values and our core values as a medical community and as a democracy,” Farrell said.
The Cleveland Clinic made a similar decision to keep a February fundraising event at Mar-a-Lago, but said it will not commit to using the same location for next year’s event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 1, 2017 at 1:18 a.m.
President Donald Trump nominated Neil M. Gorsuch, a graduate of Harvard Law School, to the United States Supreme Court in a ceremony at the White House Tuesday.
If confirmed, Gorsuch will be the sixth member of the current court to have attended the Law School.
Gorsuch succeeds Antonin Scalia, who passed away in February 2016. Gorsuch earned his J.D. from the Law School in 1991, where he also received a Truman Scholarship and worked for the Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Project and the Harvard Defenders program.
"His work as a federal judge, scholar, teacher, and lawyer in both public and private practice, show commitment to rigorous thinking and fairness, and the nation is fortunate to have the benefit of his talents," Law School Dean Martha L. Minow wrote of Gorsuch in a statement.
President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to a federal judgeship in 2006.
Gorsuch follows a judicial philosophy that argues for a strict reading of the Constitution that tends to produce more conservative rulings, similar to that of Scalia’s. He spoke of about his judicial approach in a speech following his nomination.
“It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives,” Gorsuch said. “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches, is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers, rather than those the law demands.”
Trump’s nomination comes months after he released a list of potential candidates for the role while still a candidate for president. Former president Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland ’74, also a Harvard Law School graduate, following Scalia’s death, but Senate Republicans blocked his nomination for months. Democratic Senators have threatened to attempt to block any Trump nominee that fell outside of the “mainstream.”
Gorsuch will now face the U.S. Senate for confirmation. If Democrats filibuster, more than 60 Senators will need to vote for him to overcome the Democratic block. Trump has urged the Senate to alter its normal proceedings and require a simple majority vote to confirm Gorsuch.
Trump said in his nomination speech that Gorsuch’s academic credentials, including his undergraduate degree from Columbia and doctorate from Oxford, were “as good as I have ever seen,” and emphasized his hope for a Senate confirmation.
“I only hope that both Democrats and Republicans can come together for once, for the good of the country,” Trump said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard administrators spoke out against President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration executive orders, the University’s undocumented students say they are pleased with Harvard’s actions—like creating a website and appointing an immigration attorney—that aim to support them.
In an email to Harvard affiliates Sunday, University President Drew G. Faust reaffirmed the University’s commitment to diversity and inclusion and outlined action to advise undocumented students during what she called “times of unsettling change.”
Specifically, she said the Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic has “engaged” a full-time attorney for undocumented students, and will look to further develop a website consolidating online immigration resources.
In response, several of Harvard’s dozens of undocumented students said they were pleased with Faust’s allocation of resources.
“I feel pretty protected on campus and I’m pretty sure most students do as well,”  said Paulo J. Pinto ’18, an undocumented College student from Portugal. Pinto added that despite Faust’s refusal to call Harvard a “sanctuary” campus, he feels the campus is adequately serving its undocumented students.
“I think the policies that the University has outlined reflect a lot of those ‘sanctuary’ policies that cities do,” Pinto said.
Enrique Ramirez ’17 said he thought the College specifically—which has dedicated a “point person” for undocumented students’ concerns— “is doing more than enough.”
Jin K. Park ’18, an undocumented student from South Korea, said while he was pleased with Faust’s support, Harvard still stands to do more to protect its vulnerable students.
“It’s not just about talking to people in the Harvard community,” Park said. “It means showing up to rallies in support of undocumented students.”
Park added that he thinks Faust and other administrators should be visible in their resistance to the Trump administration’s views on immigration.
“President Faust, given the political climate, has to come out as a really vocal proponent of reform,” Park said. He suggested that faculty members voice support for undocumented immigrants in their courses and create “an overlapping consensus on what inclusion means” across the University.
Reacting to Trump’s executive orders, which throughout Trump's 11-day presidency have advocated stripping federal funding from sanctuary cities and building a wall on the United States’ southern border, some undocumented students say they are upset and frightened.
For Ramirez, a beneficiary of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, continued anti-immigration action could pose job security risks.
“If Trump takes away DACA, then I won’t have a way to work legally in the U.S.,” Ramirez said. “I might not have the chance to work.”
DACA, which came into effect during the Obama administration, allows undocumented children to obtain work permits, Social Security numbers, and government identification.
Park, who is also a DACA beneficiary, said he was upset by what he characterized as Trump’s xenophobia in crafting the executive orders.
“Undocumented people have been scapegoated and blamed for decades,” he said.
Hiram J. Rios Hernandez, chair of the Kennedy School’s Latinx Caucus, said he was especially upset by Trump’s order to defund sanctuary cities.
“It’s offensive, it’s hurtful, and it’s a little shortsighted,” Hernandez said.

Twenty-seven students have  declared candidacy for 12 open seats on the Undergraduate Council in its midterm election, with a delayed Elm Yard deadline after a former representative resigned with short notice.
The election and campaign period will occur between Feb. 1 and Feb. 3. Compared to the previous year, relatively few undergraduates will seek positions on the Council for the upcoming semester—in last year’s midterm election, 35 students ran for seats.
Two Houses—Lowell and Quincy —will have uncontested elections, while competitive races will occur in Adams House, Kirkland House, Cabot House, Currier House, Pforzheimer House, Winthrop House, and Elm Yard.
Elm Yard, comprised of the Grays, Matthews, and Weld freshman dorms, has an open seat after Tingyue Cui ’20 resigned from the UC on Monday, according to UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18. Cui did not respond to requests for comment.
After Cui’s resignation, current Elm Yard representatives Adam E. Harper ’20 and Henry S. Atkins ’20 sent an email to Elm Yard residents with a link directing students to declare their candidacies. UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 moved the deadline for Elm Yard candidates to accommodate the late notice.
According to UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18, nine students have declared their candidacy in Elm Yard. Harper said there is a lot of interest in the open freshman seat.
“It sounds like we’re going to have a pretty competitive race, as are most elections for the freshman class,” Harper said.
The following individuals have declared their candidacy for the UC this election:
Adams House
Nicholas P. Heath ’18
Ryan K. Sim ’19
Thomas M. Han ’19
Anna T. Wechsler ’18
Cabot House
Thomas Chatzieleftheriou ’19

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s edition of the annual men’s swimming and diving HYP meet will be missing a crucial element – Princeton. With the Tigers’ season suspended, the contest will only feature Harvard and Yale.
Despite Princeton’s absence, the meet will not be lacking in importance or competitive racing. Both the Crimson (9-0, 5-0 Ivy League) and the Bulldogs (9-1, 5-0 Ivy) will enter the Kiphuth Pool in New Haven this weekend without a loss in the Ancient Eight, meaning that one team will emerge as the conference dual champion, and the other will walk away with its first league defeat of the season.
“We are currently undefeated in the Ivy League, and we intend for it to stay that way,” senior Christian Carbone said. “We are hungry and focused, and we have been working very hard all year to achieve our goals.”
In December, the Tigers had the remainder of their season canceled by the Princeton athletic department after the discovery that vulgar, racist, and misogynistic materials had been disseminated amongst team members, largely over a university-sponsored mailing list.
However, the Tigers’ absence will not impact Harvard’s strategy.
“The cancellation of Princeton’s season has not affected our training plans or race plans,” senior Christian Carbone said. “Although we won’t be competing against Princeton this weekend or at the Ivy League Championships, we intend to go into these competitions with the same mentality that we would have if we were racing Princeton: that is, to underestimate no one, to give every race our all, and to have fun.”
With Princeton out of the mix, the fight for Ivy League dual season supremacy comes down to the Crimson and Yale. History is not on the Bulldogs’ side, as Yale has not topped Harvard in the regular season since 1992. Nonetheless, this year’s Bulldogs lineup is talented, and has picked up only one defeat, to Penn State in January.
Yale junior standout Kei Hyogo has been essential to the Bulldogs’ success. The Yokohama, Japan native has won at least one event at every meet he’s entered this season and hasn’t missed out on a top-three spot in a single race.
Yale has also found success in the diving events, led by freshman Chris LaBella. The rookie took top marks in the one-meter dive in the team’s last meet against Cornell and has only ended up out of podium position once in his debut season.
The Bulldogs duo is backed up by a Yale squad that has been performing well across the board, with 17 different swimmers and divers capturing wins so far this season.
The Crimson will hope to find an answer to the Bulldogs’ talent in its deep squad and accomplished freshman class.
Harvard reached nine wins for the third time in three seasons with a victory over Boston College on January 21st, beating the Eagles behind a team-wide effort. Such strong performances across the squad have become the norm for the Crimson.
The team’s success in relay events is representative of its depth. Harvard has not lost a single relay race at a dual meet this season, and the Crimson is likely to provide a formidable challenge for Yale’s relay lineups this weekend.
Harvard has also benefited from a talented freshman class. First-year Dean Farris has been particularly effective for the Crimson, collecting 20 victories so far this season. The team will likely look to Farris and his classmates, including standouts Daniel Chang and Raphael Marcoux to make an impact in their first meet against the Bulldogs.
Harvard’s divers had had a strong season as well. Junior David Pfeiffer, who qualified in December for the NCAA zone championships, and classmate Bobby Ross have picked up a number of wins and will seek to end LaBella’s hot streak this weekend.
As the Crimson heads into its final regular meet of the year, athletes across the team share a sense of excitement and a common set of goals.
“Heading into this meet, we want to focus on the things we can control such as swimming fast individually and performing personal bests on the diving boards,” Chang said. “We’re really excited to see where all lot our hard work this season has led us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to put its ECAC struggles behind, the Harvard women’s hockey team faced off against Beantown rival and host Northeastern in the first round of the 2017 Women’s Beanpot.
For the second consecutive year, however, the Crimson was unable to advance to the Boston tournament’s championship match as a brace by Northeastern winger Paige Savage keyed the Huskies (17-9-3, 12-7-2 Hockey East) to a 4-1 victory over Harvard (3-16-3, 3-10-3 ECAC).
“Obviously [it] was a very disappointing effort from us, right off the bat.” Harvard coach Katey stone said. “We got a little bit better as the game went on but unfortunately we weren’t very good on our own end tonight. We were playing catch-up the entire evening which is difficult thing to do against a good Northeastern team.”
After conceding a pair of early goals during a shaky first frame, Harvard began to find its rhythm offensively and looked to be back in the game as senior defender Natasha Rachlin and freshman winger Kat Hughes setup junior center Lexie Laing.
The Marblehead, Mass. native controlled the puck in the faceoff circle and sent a backhand past Northeastern goalie Britanny Bulgaski to cut the opponent’s lead to a 2-1 margin at 8:49.
“As soon as our [defense] got the puck in our [defensive] zone, we moved it up to the wing and then we moved it up to the center and either I would take it in or pass it.” Laing said “Our mentality is kick it wide and go hard to the net and that’s just what our line really focused on the whole second period.”
Though the Crimson took advantage of the goal to put the Huskies on their heels, it did not take long for the hosts to recover, as Harvard found itself lucky not to concede with just under seven minutes left in the second stanza.
A Northeastern shot at goal triggered a scrum that allowed the puck to linger around the crease before freshman defender Kyra Colbert cleared it right as a Huskies’ stick looked to guide the puck home.
Less than a minute later, the horn went off as Savage bagged her second score of the night to give her team a 3-1 advantage. The senior took control of the puck along the boards and quickly wrapped around the net to easily score, as Tissenbaum was unable to shift stickside in time to prevent the goal.
“My linemates did at all. They pinned the [defense] back and I was able to walk it to the net and put the puck in.” Savage said.
Forward McKenna Brand put the finishing touches for the Huskies, as the junior netted her team’s fourth a mere 18 seconds into a powerplay situation after Crimson junior defender Chelsea Ziadie was sent to the box for body checking.
Things got off to a bad start for the Crimson from the get go, as the Huskies’ front line applied plenty of pressure to the Harvard blue line, not allowing it to establish its footing.
Less than a minute into the game, Northeastern forward Halee Silva took advantage set off the horn for the hosts as the junior redirected rookie defender Paige Capistran’s shot from the point gloveside past Crimson senior netminder Molly Tissenbaum.
Despite Harvard’s attempts at getting into a groove, the team struggled to string together a strong offensive sequence, failing to take advantage of an early powerplay situation after Huskies forward Denisa Krizova was sent to the penalty box for cross-checking.
Just over two minutes after Northeastern returned to full strength, Tissenbaum was forced to recover the puck from the back of her goal once again, as Savage snuck the puck stickside past Tissenbaum from the faceoff circle to double the Huskies’ lead and ultimately give her team all the space it needed.
Stone will look to take advantage of the upcoming games to continue adjusting her squad and make the needed changes to match last year’s third place finish next Tuesday. Though her team has had to deal with issues such as a short bench with a mere fifteen skaters, Stone insists Harvard needs to continue adjusting if they are to get on track.
“We’re going to piece it together the best we can.” Stone said. “No matter what I think we all feel like we could have played better tonight, every one of us. Regardless of the situation, it’s that next man up mentality. We’ve just got to sort through this and find a way to win some hockey games down the stretch.”
