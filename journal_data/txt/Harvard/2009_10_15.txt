After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each October, when Americans celebrate Columbus Day, they celebrate Christopher Columbus’s 1492 “discovery” of North America, a continent already home to hundreds of thousands of indigenous inhabitants. In other words, to celebrate Columbus Day is in part to assume that American history, a trajectory that stretches back for centuries before 1492, begins with the presence of white European explorers—an assumption that smacks of an outmoded, Eurocentric worldview. And while the holiday’s national importance has thankfully diminished in recent decades, the trend away from celebrating Columbus Day should continue even further, and the holiday should be officially replaced with another that celebrates the role and presence of Native Americans in our national history.
First of all, the relevance of Christopher Columbus to the specific history of the United States is dubious at best—the man was an Italian hired by the Spanish crown who landed in Latin America rather than in Boston or in the Chesapeake. If anything, his arrival in the “New World” marks the dawn of an era of European expansion and exploitation, which devastated Native Americans and other indigenous populations. And considering that Columbus Day is the only American national holiday (aside from January’s Martin Luther King, Jr. ,Day) still to bear the name of a single and, at least from the perspective of United States history, not entirely germane individual, its celebration is even more of an anachronism that ought to be replaced.
It would thus be a positive force countering the lingering Eurocentrism in American history if there were at least one holiday commemorating and celebrating Native Americans. Some states like South Dakota and Alabama have already taken the initiative to rename Columbus Day within their own borders, but, on the national level, Columbus Day is still a federal holiday, which should no longer be the case. Replacing Columbus Day with a holiday celebrating Native American culture will do much to bring this country to the realization that its history consists of many episodes less wholesome than the common image—real or imagined—of the first Thanksgiving, where Plymouth colonists shared corn with the local native tribes.
But while a nominal change of the Columbus Day holiday is a start, this country can do much more to challenge the unfortunately widespread Eurocentric approach to American history. For the most part, today’s American children and high-school students are taught that American history begins in 1607, the year the Jamestown settlement was established. Such an approach to American history is as inappropriate as it is inaccurate. And although replacing Columbus Day would certainly be a step in the right direction, we hope that the change would inspire a stronger commitment to teaching the true trajectory of American history—a story that begins well before 1607 or, for that matter, 1492.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scene: a birthday party. Two mothers converse as one pours a cup full of red liquid. The other, skeptical because she knows the drink in question contains high-fructose corn syrup, remarks: “Wow, you don’t care what the kids eat, huh?” Mom One responds with a blasé chuckle, noting that “it’s made from corn, it’s natural, and, like sugar, it’s fine in moderation.” Clearly embarrassed and relieved, Mom Two smiles… and takes a sip.
This commercial, and others like it, claims to provide “the facts” about America’s ubiquitous sweetener. Who’s behind them? The American Medical Association? An unbiased public health organization? The United States government? Not even close: the Corn Refiners Association.
Clearly, the industry is terrified. As more and more Americans join health-food aficionados in regarding high fructose corn syrup as basically poison and more and more consumers choose products that don’t contain it, the CRA faces a crisis in the making. It desperately needs to draw a line between high-fructose corn syrup and junk food in the American mind. And so began an 18-month campaign in late June 2008 to promote the substance. The CRA’s website, sweetsurprise.com, includes quotes from “experts” to assure consumers of high- fructose corn syrup’s benignity, a “myth vs. fact” section, not to mention images of smiling, adorable kids and wholesome stalks of corn bedecking the background. The CRA’s name appears only once on the main page, in tiny print at the very bottom.
The premise of the campaign—that the sweetener is no more harmful than other, similar substances—certainly seems surprising. Since results from the scientific community vary (despite the CRA’s attempts to convince us otherwise), there’s definite reason for pause. But arguments over high-fructose corn syrup’s intrinsic dangers actually overlook the crux of the issue. Ultimately, it’s our unwitting over-consumption of the substance and the environmental impacts of this consumption that prove most troubling.
The key to understanding our lack of moderation lies buried in the CRA’s very own website, which states that, “High fructose corn syrup often plays a key role in the integrity of food and beverage products that has little to do with sweetening.” In other words, Americans consume a huge amount of the substance without knowing it. Even if high-fructose corn syrup doesn’t contribute more to obesity than other types of “caloric sweeteners,” everyone agrees that eating endless quantities of sugar and caloric sugar substitutes leads to weight gain.
Recently, I opened up my aunt’s refrigerator and pantry to investigate. I discovered the ingredient in some obviously sweet places, like Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes and Schweppes ginger ale. But it also appeared in Heinz Ketchup, KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce, and Wishbone Italian dressing. It’s safe to say that most Americans don’t account for ketchup and salad dressing when keeping track of their sugar intake. Sweetsurprise.com lists multiple places where high fructose corn syrup serves a purpose: in breads, canned and frozen fruits, yogurt, spaghetti sauces, and beverages. Who knew?
High-fructose corn syrup poses a threat beyond simple health concerns. Michael Pollan, renowned author of “The Omnivore’s Dilemma” and “In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto,” notes in the Washington Post that the substance “may be cheap in the supermarket, but in the environment it could not be more expensive.” The American corn industry, which produces grain en masse, relies on monoculture: growing one crop on the same land year after year, which depletes soil and requires large quantities of fertilizers. As Pollan writes, this lack of “diversified agriculture” creates incredible dependence on nitrogen—leading to detrimental environmental effects: “By fertilizing the world, we alter the planet’s composition of species and shrink its biodiversity.” Consuming high-fructose corn syrup, a key product of this industry, reinforces the monoculture cycle. And, since U.S. government subsidies maintain low corn prices, the sweetener remains cheap and highly desirable for food producers. They’re unlikely to abandon it any time soon.
Pollan’s books, along with Eric Schlosser’s “Fast Food Nation,” and the documentary “Supersize Me,” aim to open Americans’ eyes to consequences of the meals they unconsciously eat. High-fructose corn syrup belongs in this discussion—and out of our stomachs—despite what the Corn Refiners Association wants us to think.

On October 18th, Harvard’s Environmental Action Committee will kick off its “Road to Copenhagen” with a convocation by climate activist Bill McKibbon at Memorial Church. Over the following five days, the organization will host a series of events that focus attention on the need to stabilize the atmosphere’s carbon concentration at 350 parts per million. The festivities will culminate on the 24th with the International Day of Climate Action. The brainchild of McKibbon, 350 intends to promote global community actions that can be recorded and presented to world leaders when they meet in December at Copenhagen to negotiate a new climate treaty. McKibben, along with many other environmental activists, hopes that these images will serve as evidence of global support for reducing carbon concentrations to 350 ppm.
All of this begs the question: What is so special about 350 ppm, and why should it be the target? The answer to the former can be found in a December 2007 paper by NASA scientist Jim Hansen (and others), which identifies 350 ppm as the concentration at which carbon levels would have to stabilize in order to minimize climate-change impacts. The paper cites potential “irreversible catastrophic effects” if we exceed the 350 ppm target for a long period. An article in Nature and the support of the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajenda Pachauri, have since corroborated their findings. Generally, the evidence suggests that sustained concentrations above 350 ppm will lead to drastic increases in global temperature, the complete melting of polar ice, and dramatic loss of biodiversity.
It may seem obvious then why 350 should be our target. However, nothing in climate politics is simple or obvious. Scientifically, it may be clear that if we do not target 350 ppm we are asking for a disaster. But politics does not always pay attention to science. Rather, officials see that the first step to hit the 350 ppm mark is to eliminate all coal-fired power plants by 2030, which buys a lot of political opposition. Power companies, coal companies, coal states, coal workers, and anyone who likes cheap energy have a stake in seeing that 350 ppm does not become the target.
As a result, events like the 350 Day can play an important role in reaching this goal. If we hope to change the political atmosphere, we must start with vocal public support for reducing emissions. Otherwise, the negotiators at Copenhagen and in the U.S. Senate, among other places, will accomplish nothing of substance. Anyone who has an interest in seeing a meaningful treaty develop this December (read: everyone) should be taking action this coming week to make sure that policy makers know what is at stake—and that the world demands change.
If we continue to increase from our current 390 ppm, we will soon hit the point between 450 ppm (the IPCC’s current target) and 500 ppm, at which Earth will become completely ice-free. An ice-free world would lead to, among other things, higher sea levels and decreased fresh-water availability as glaciers that supply nearly one billion people with water disappear. Furthermore, while many climate naysayers point to relatively stable global temperatures in the last decade, they ignore that the decline in summer arctic ice that scientists had predicted would occur in the next 80 years now appears likely to occur in the next five. This is one of a number of climate-related phenomena—including expanded ranges for mosquitoes and changes in amphibian breeding cycles—that are occurring much sooner than anticipated. This suggests that the current target is simply too high.
Thus, to come back to our question, why 350 ppm? The cynical answer is that ,while political inertia will prevent us from reaching 350 ppm in any meaningful time frame, aiming for that level might be the only way we can reach 450 ppm and avoid some of the worst dangers of climate change. Achieving 350 ppm promises to be enormously expensive and, barring a climate catastrophe in the next few years, is not likely to happen in the near future. However, without grassroots mobilization and political pressure to reach 350 ppm from events like the 350 Day, it is highly unlikely that we will change business-as-usual emissions enough to stabilize below the highly-dangerous 500 ppm.
As a step in the right direction, join the EAC on the 24th it weatherizes homes around Cambridge to make them more energy-efficient. This is a simple way to reduce Cambridge’s own footprint while helping to build the grassroots support for 350 ppm that will be necessary to overcome political inertia. The coal industry has a strong political voice already—those in favor of climate policy now need to match it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editors:
I was first astonished, then outraged, and finally saddened by The Harvard Crimson’s story of September 29 about e-mail messages to Harvard College students from a former graduate student in the Economics Department. It is hard for me to believe that anyone who reads these e-mails, or the former student’s blog, will take the allegations they contain as seriously as The Crimson seems to do.
The Crimson appears to be utterly unaware of the commitment to students that has led my Economics Department colleagues and the university administration to remain silent about this affair. There are strict rules governing the privacy of students with respect to medical and administrative matters. These rules, which are intended to protect vulnerable individuals, make it impossible to discuss the reasons why, to quote your article, the former student “said she was required to take an involuntary medical leave of absence on Aug. 9, 2007, and was required to withdraw from GSAS at the Aug. 31 Administrative Board meeting this year.”
Readers of The Crimson should know that Professor Kenneth Rogoff, a particular target of the e-mails, has handled this matter with consummate professionalism, consulting the university administration at every stage. The e-mail from Professor Rogoff quoted in the Crimson story used text suggested to him by GSAS administrators. Deans Michael Smith and Allan Brandt have expressed their strong support in a recent letter to Professor Rogoff, which states “the allegations about your conduct, described in the article and the mounting mass emails, were without any substance” and concludes, “You are, and always have been, an upstanding member of our community, a wonderful colleague, and a valuable mentor to many students.”
I strongly support Harvard’s commitment, quoted in the Crimson story, to “not condone or tolerate harassment—physically, verbally, or electronically—of any member of our community.” It saddens me that The Crimson has chosen to contribute to harassment rather than to oppose it.

To the editors:
As a long-time fan of The Crimson and one who has enjoyed working with several of your recent editors, I was gravely disappointed by the lapse of editorial judgment in publishing a recent article, “Ex-Grad Student Alleges Misconduct” (Sept 29, 2009).
The heart of the article is that a former graduate student, forced to leave the university on medical grounds and now living in China, has accused the Harvard Economics Department of discrimination and accused one of its world-class faculty members of sexual advances.
Had the accuser come to your offices in person to make these allegations, you would have asked yourselves: Does she have any evidence? Is she personally credible? Is there a second source with any corroborating evidence? You know full well that you would have found all three answers to be “no.” You would also have found that the university had already investigated these charges and found them false. Under such circumstances, you would not have published an article citing her allegations, recognizing how unfair it would be to the parties accused. That is Journalism 101.
What made this situation unusual is that the accuser did not come to you privately but papered the campus with e-mails from afar. You apparently decided that the e-mails created a bit of a stir and made it a legitimate news story. Why? How could you? Allegations that are false when told to a handful of people do not become true when told to a thousand. And they become even more malicious. “All the news that is fit to print”—it is the last part of that slogan that was forgotten here.
Without intending harm, I am sure, The Crimson has allowed itself to be used to smear the reputation of outstanding members of the Harvard community with false allegations of impropriety. These are serious matters at a university. I urge you to publish an explanation and apology, erasing this stain upon the parties and, indeed, uponThe Crimson itself.

To the editors:
The Crimson is my morning newspaper, and I benefit daily from its fine reporting of news stories that concern the Harvard community. When I read the headline “Ex-Graduate Student Alleges Misconduct” and realized that the story concerned my department, one faculty member in particular, and a graduate student who has not been at Harvard since 2007, I was astonished. The story concerned the contents of an e-mail sent by the former graduate student to a large number of undergraduates. The numerous allegations in the e-mail and on the accompanying blog have no basis in fact.
What, then, was the story? Anyone with the slightest amount of technical sophistication can send e-mails to hundreds of undergraduates alleging misbehavior of members of our community. The Crimson staff has revealed that it will be that person’s soapbox and amplifier.
It is generally good journalism to consider a story publishable only if it has a reliable source and corroborative evidence. If the story makes allegations that could be harmful to individuals it must pass higher standards. This story met none of the commonly accepted criteria for a publishable news item. The e-mail and the student’s blog contain wild accusations, removed from reality. The source was not reliable, there was no corroborative evidence, and the allegations were harmful to an individual and to members of an academic department.
The Crimson writes for our Harvard community and should take care that its stories do not harm the community unless they pass the high standards of good journalism. This one did not. The Crimson should publicly apologize for its lapse of good judgment.

The Otherside Café on Newbury Street teems with flannel-wearing, skateboard-riding,     scruffy-bearded hipsters. It’s the perfect place to fit in with people who avoid fitting in and to get away from the “conventional” Harvard polo and seersucker set.
I discovered The Otherside when I turned 21 last February, after hearing that it was a destination for other beer connoisseurs (read: snobs). Since then, I’ve frequented the café for another reason: no place makes me happier to be a pencil-headed chemistry major (though those $10 beers are quite good, as well). It is a great place to watch people trying really hard to be something they aren’t.
Consider the scene at The Otherside one recent Friday night: the restaurant’s usual throng burst into a roar when two of the scruffiest, hipster-iest men in the establishment began flinging small objects off a balcony into the crowd below. The objects, it turned out, were decks of cards and miniature palm-sized helmets—just large enough for a hipster to keep a finger or two safe while zooming around Boston on a bike without breaks.
When they tossed my group our own set of helmets and cards, we realized that the tchotchkes, appropriately labeled “free shit,” came to us courtesy of Vans Shoes. I suspected that these trend-setters were in fact the world’s most intentionally unkempt marketing reps.    It would be an understatement to say that the “free shit” was a hit, as was the ensuing screening of a snowboarding highlight reel accompanied by rap and European-sounding techno. All in all, it was an evening filled with plenty of advertising and mainstream music.
The experience was akin to what you might find in a bar or nightclub anywhere, even Harvard Square—well, except for the flannel. The crowd basked in the excesses of America’s particular brand of pervasive consumerism; the scene involved everything hipster culture seemed to reject. My friends and I, however, enjoyed the extravaganza without putting on airs that we didn’t.
Each time I visit The Otherside, I am reminded that fitting into hipster culture, and into many other social groups, requires a very specific set of affectations. By contrast, at Harvard you can almost always fit into a community as you are. I’ve spent quite a bit of time reflecting on whether and how my life would have been different if I had traded in my hours in lab and long nights perfecting problem sets to fit in with any given social set. Now, as a senior, I realize that it certainly would be different, but probably not for the better.
When I came to college, my priorities were to learn a lot, and to have fun—in that order. I learned quickly that the two are not mutually exclusive; learning something that truly excites me proved to be quite a bit of fun in its own right and I learned that, with a bit of planning, work need not preclude play.
The key was taking ownership of my actions and reminding myself that, just because my lab work or homework kept me in on a Thursday night, I wasn’t a martyr for science, deserving of sympathy.     To me, not having to pretend to dislike things that I actually appreciate is the most liberating aspect of my experience at Harvard.
Almost no one fits into only one niche at Harvard; there are physicists in finals clubs, bookworms on sports teams, and future politicians sprinkled across the academic spectrum. These odd combinations fly in the face of expectation and significantly enrich and interlink the different strands of life on campus.
All of this is enabled by the willingness of students to love their many passions unapologetically and by the willingness of their peers to appreciate the diversity of skills and interests on campus—and even to put up with the occassional periodic table joke every once in a while.   We are at Harvard, after all. Everyone else thinks we’re nerdy anyway, so why not enjoy it?

At 8 p.m. on Wednesday, October 7th, at a Harvard Women in Business Event, two impeccably dressed blondes spoke to a crowd of around 250 Harvard students packed into the seats of Emerson 105. 10 hours earlier, in that very same room, the seats were similarly full, as students listened to a lecture on the intricacies of market demand. This night, though, Alexandra Wilkis Wilson ’99 and Alexis M. Maybank ’97 discussed a different sort of financial asset.
GILT-Y PLEASURES
On November 13, 2007, Wilson and Maybank founded Gilt Groupe, a Web site that offers invitation-only access to men’s, women’s, and children’s luxury brands. The catch? These items are only available during a 36-hour time period, where members must click and purchase before the goods run out. Daily sales, featuring items from designers like Burberry, Alexander McQueen, and Oscar de la Renta, start at noon.
That pressure to log on to the Web at noon separates Gilt from other online shopping sites, like BlueFly and ShopBop. “People are trained to make purchasing decisions within minutes, which I think leads to some of the excitement,” Wilson says. “Sometimes it can be a little nerve-wracking,” she adds.“It’s very hard,” says Jonathan R. Meminger ’12, a sophomore who shops with Gilt. “If you’re an hour late, all the hot items are gone.”
A new iPhone application keeps Gilt Groupe members connected. “I actually just took it off my phone because I’ve been spending a little too much money,” Meminger says. But this ticking clock only amps up the Web site’s allure. “I usually check out Gilt every day,” Katerina P. Stavreva ’10 says. “I shop everywhere, but Gilt is pretty much my favorite one.” Stavreva’s recent purchases include a pair of Sergio Rossi high heels. “They’re amazing,” she adds.
Gilt Groupe’s appeal, in the Harvard community and beyond, seems inextricably linked to the Web site’s 36-hour shopping window. It was this, the idea of a time crunch, that allowed Wilson and Maybank to assess a growing industry, and carve out a niche in a popular market. That model has been expanded to other Gilt Groupe projects, like Gilt Fuse, the Web site’s younger, hipper sister. But enough economics, it’s time for a history lesson.
GILT BY ASSOCIATION
Maybank, an Enviromental Science and Public Policy concentrator, and Wilson, a Romance Languages and Literatures concentrator, met in a Portuguese class (“Of all things,” Maybank says). Though Maybank was a senior and Wilson was a sophomore, both lived in Lowell.  “I loved my time at Harvard,” Maybank says. “I had a great social experience here, a great social life, and then did a little bit of homework too along the way.” That bit of homework led Maybank to a finance job in New York City, and then later to Harvard Business School where she bumped into Wilson.
After graduation, two took off in separate directions—to separate coasts, in fact. They met in New York, sometimes, to shop special sample sales. The sample sale, according to Maybank, is an invite-only sale hosted by luxury brands during the day. Maybank explains that the sales take place at slightly out-of-the-way locations.
“But it’s great inventory and almost always 75% off,” she says. “So a lot of men and women will sneak out of their office during the day just to attend one.” Maybank smiled. “It creates this kind of hysteria.” The sample sale—and its hysteria—inspired Maybank and Wilson to start Gilt Groupe.
“We wanted to take that idea and take it online to a national audience, but have that same sense of event-based shopping, urgency, people dropping everything to be there.” All they needed was a name.“We chose the name Gilt because it had some double meaning,” Wilson says. “So obviously you feel guilty when you shop, but Gilt also implies being covered in gold and sort of luxurious items like that.”
This feeling is perpetuated by the aesthetics of the Web site itself—a classic black and white backdrop, accented with gold.  Surveys confirmed the name’s popularity. “We realized that Gilt was such an easy name to remember both for men and women,” Wilson adds.
So Gilt Groupe was born as the first online, nation-wide sample sale. Maybank and Wilson launched their company with seven employees and now, nearly two years later, Gilt Groupe encompasses a staff of 300.
Tessa K. Lyons-Laing ’11, HUWIB Intercollegiate Business Convention Chair arranged for Maybank and Wilson to return to Harvard and share their business experience. “I thought that they would be really inaccessible and sort of beyond wanting to engage with college kids,” she said. “So when they were really excited for the event and willing to even fly in from New York themselves, I was amazed.”
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GILT-Y
In Emerson 105, Wilson and Maybank spoke about the obstacles they faced as women in business, stressing the importance of finding strong mentors.Alexandra D. Daum ’10, a former Crimson business executive, spent the summer working at Gilt Groupe in New York as a merchandising assistant.
“I’ve always known I wanted to go into business,” she says, “I’m just excited that I finally figured out what kind.” Maybank offers some final words of wisdom to all Harvard students, and not just those interested in business or fashion. “Don’t necessarily do what you should do,” she says. “Do what you need to do,” she says. “You don’t need another name or brand on a resume. Follow your passions.”

Unlike Lindsay Lohan, professors occasionally try to keep their private lives out of the public eye. But FM wants to bring you closer and has gone behind the scenes to visit professors in their homes, exploring everything from their closets to their iPods. Without further ado, FM Cribs presents our first host—Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology, Steven A. Pinker.
The Crib: A 6th floor loft on South Street, in Boston’s “Leather District,” which was originally a leather warehouse.
Size: Approximately 2400 square feet.
Vibe: A sleek mix of historical crumbliness with an urban, modern flair. Right off the red line so Pinker can take the T to Harvard.
Price: Undisclosed.
MAIN LIVING SPACE:
“Should we take a photo of me in my study? No...That would be too nerdy.”
As you make your way into Steve Pinker’s loft, the first thing that strikes you is the fact that he’s wearing black Calvin Klein jeans. The second thing is the giant open space. The living room, dining room, kitchen, and his study are all out in one area. A generous amount of windows spaced throughout the brick walls provides ample lighting, giving an air of softness yet practicality. The walls, placed in a zigzag modernist form, are lined with dozens of photographs, all taken by Pinker himself. He happily points out his little masterpieces.
“These are from a trip to Sonoma County, in California. It was the first trip my wife and I went on together, about four years ago,” Pinker says. “Others are from various parts of the world, California, Alaska, and Canadian Rockies.”
His office, which sits on a raised wooden platform and overlooks the entire space, is also practical and decorated in a contemporary fashion. An abstractly shaped blue couch, slightly reminiscent of a progressive psychiatrist’s chaise, sits in the left-hand corner. A giant desk overflowing with papers and books occupies the entire right-hand side, with a bookcase on the left to finish it off. No surprises about this set up.
However, your eyes stop at a giant wooden shelf with only one thing on it—an old Yiddish typewriter. “That was given to my wife, who is a novelist and a philosopher, Rebecca Goldstein,” explains Pinker regarding the offbeat decoration. “It might have been used by Isaac Bashevis Singer—it’s from the teens or twenties, and this is one of our prized possessions.”
“BOOKSHELVES”:
“Book ends are barbaric.”
A giant wall lined with book-filled cubes, measuring 21 feet by 10 feet, is the loft’s focal point. Installed mostly by Pinker himself, the cubes hold the couple’s book collection that numbers in the thousands. Cubes seem to be a theme in Pinker’s lifestyle.
“I like cubes; I think book ends are barbaric. They’re so primitive..books fall over and get stuck,” says Pinker. As for favorite books, Pinker points to Williams James’s Principles of Psychology.
“And certainly I’m a fan of my wife’s fiction,” he adds.
KITCHEN:
In the loft spirit, the kitchen unsurprisingly follows an open plan. An empty aquarium that used to house live animals provides a stage for Pinker to shows us a little bit of his humor. “We used to have frogs in this aquarium, but they croaked.” Oh Pinks.
Venturing over to the fridge, we wonder if there is a certain outlook on food for the mind. Apparently, the answer lies in leftover Chinese food and Silver Palate oatmeal.
“We keep a very low-fat diet, although it’s almost irresistible to not eat Chinese takeout,” says Pinker. “I have many boxes of Silver Palate Thick and Rough Oatmeal, which I order from Amazon.com. It’s really a superior oatmeal.” Sorry Quaker!
As Pinker talks about barbecues at his Cape Cod house, his wife, Rebecca Goldstein, hurries in fresh from the Cape, wearing knee high boots, a leather jacket, and Dior sunglasses. They hug and Goldstein ushers us to her study.
REBECCA’S STUDY:
[CAPTION]: Big beams hold up the ceiling of this old freight elevator shaft. Hanging on the wall is a small puppet of Baruch Spinoza, the subject of her most recent book.
MASTER SUITE:
Per usual, the bedroom is a giant, open and sparsely decorated space. In addition to the photographs of old Hungarian relatives and current family members, a sleek iPod player graces the resting chamber.
“At night we just put on jazz because head banging rock and roll isn’t the best stuff to fall asleep too,” says Pinker. During the day, he admits to being a fan of U2, the Rolling Stones, and Springstein.
The bed is floor level, and the mattress Tempur-Pedic. And again, the cubes appear. Pinker arranges his shirts and clothes in cubes. He points out a favorite shirt with “Science is Sexy” emblazoned on the front.
How does Pinker keep it all clean? With a little help from his friend, the Roomba.
In the bathroom, fossils are inlayed in the marble floors. His wife’s perfume sits atop the sink’s counter but any bottles belonging to Pinker are noticeably absent. Cologne is a no-go for the man.
“It can be a little Austin Powers-ish,” explains Pinker. “I used to wear it in the 70’s but not these days."

Unbeknownst to many students, nestled deep in the basement of Pfoho’s Holmes Hall lies a brightly colored yet hidden musical lair: the Quad Sound Studios (QSS).  QSS is a student run recording studio available to both Harvard students and members of the community at large who are looking for an affordable option to record their musical projects with high quality and professional equipment.
“We work with student classical groups, larger string ensembles, as well as a cappella and more contemporary jazz groups, rock bands, and acoustic singer/songwriters—basically any sort of audio recording project,” says R. Derek Wetzel ’10, co-president of QSS, singer for on-campus band Stealth Foxx, and also a Crimson Arts writer.
So far this year, the studio has been very quiet. There are only three members, who replace equipment and sort through documents to get the studio running in full force by the spring.
“Not many people jam here. It’s more people sign up to use the space, come in, and leave,” says Ben C. Cosgrove ’10, co-president.
Students who want full access to the studio must first go through a rigorous comp this winter and commit to taking on clients once they become members.
However, for students looking for a place to rock out when common room Guitar Hero gets old, QSS is not the answer.
“We are definitely looking for guys who are very interested in pushing it, not just going in there and jamming with some friends.  We really want to avoid making it into another music practice space,” says Michael R. Polino ’11, vice president and in demand DJ.
So maybe it is time to get serious about that DJ career——if you can make it all the way to the Quad.

Every year, students living in the far reaches of the Quad or Mather eagerly anticipate the Phillips Brooks House Association Bike Auction as an easy way to save themselves from three years of shuttle dependence. Many of these students, however, were disappointed by the utter lack of merchandise at this year’s auction. Held on Oct. 3, the auction offered a meager 10 bikes for sale, compared to the nearly 50 of previous years. The reason might have something to do with the fact that the long-standing presence of Quad Bikes, the non-profit bicycle shop for the Harvard community, was nowhere to be seen. Had their charitable streak run dry?
As it turns out, there was a slight misunderstanding between PBHA and Quad Bikes over what to do with the abandoned bikes around Harvard. According to David P. Tucker, an employee of Quad Bikes, the Quad Bikes office received a call from PBHA a few days before the auction asking if they would donate any of the bikes that Quad Bikes had collected around campus back in May. “PBHA anticipated collecting whatever bikes we cut in the spring, but there was no such communication until right before the auction,” says Tucker.
PBHA Executive Vice President Lydia N. Lo ’09-’10 agreed, saying “There was a slight misunderstanding as to where the bikes would go this year.” She also said that while the bike sale is a yearly PBHA event, it raises less money than many of PBHA’s other fundraisers. “It’s about keeping up a tradition,” says Lo. “It doesn’t matter that much to PBHA in the grand scheme of things.”
Both Lo and PBHA President Richard S. Kelley ’10 says that because PBHA must depend on donations for merchandise, the number of bikes available changes every year. And this year, it may just have been an issue of quality over quantity—“We were really happy to have pretty high quality bikes this year,” says Kelley. To those bike-less Quadlings out there, better luck next year. It looks like you’re stuck with the shuttle or the long, cold trek through Cambridge Commons for the time being.

“To drag or not to drag?” This fall, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company answered that long-provoking question affirmatively. The theatrical student group will run a student-directed, all-female version of “Richard II” from October 21 to 24 in the Agassiz Theatre.
Historically, Shakespearean plays have only included male cast members, so HSC is truly breaking with tradition by giving “drag” a new meaning.
The lack of female roles in Shakespearean plays inspired Meryl H. Federman ’11, president of the HSC and the director of “Richard II”, to propose an all-female cast. “Richard II is very poetic,” says Federman. “The language is soaring and beautiful and...it fits with an all-female voice.”
But though the play lends itself to an all-female voice, cast member Emily B. Hecht ’11 says she underwent what she describes as “manliness training” before becoming one of the guys. Hecht, who plays Henry Bolingbroke, laughs while describing her preparation. “Every so often I’ll just glance and try to copy the stance of a man I see on the street,” she says, “without creeping them out.”
Clifford N. Murray ’10, president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, famous for their annual all-male show, cautions the women that performing across genders intensifies the acting experience. “You’re playing something totally different than what you’re used to,” says Murray.
Federman hesitates to overemphasize the sexual homogeneity of the play, “It’s not about gender,” she explains. “It’s not about the politics of gender, but the gender of politics.” While Federman denies that Richard II’s femininity lost him the crown, she likens him to Nixon and Blagojevich, attributing his fall to their misled self-righteousness.
HSC’s approach to the play is equally unique. Says Hecht, “[Our production] keeps a reverence for the material but also explodes it. And tears it open to look at with these new eyes.” We could be wrong, but isn’t that what (s)he said?

Catching crabs is bad in any context, but can be especially so for rowers. For the uninformed, such crew lingo may be startling, but it’s just a sample of what will be heard this upcoming weekend at the 45th Annual Head of the Charles Regatta.
Collegiate, professional and recreational rowers and their hordes of supporters will flock to Harvard Square for the Regatta, the largest two-day rowing event in the world. Any self-respecting Ivy-Leaguer must know how to navigate the crowded spectacle.
The banks of the Charles will be lined with coaches, cheering crowds, vendors, and more. Near Harvard’s Weld Boathouse will be the “Weld Exhibition,” featuring food and freebies from the race’s official sponsors, while a new food court will be set up by the Weeks Footbridge and another at the Rowing and Fitness Expo, on Soldiers Field Road.
As for actually watching the races, any spot along the banks of the river will give you a good view of the action. But those who are in the know recommend watching from Weeks or Anderson Bridges. According to Women’s Lightweight Co-Captain Grace M. Hollowell ’10, races can be won there based on steering.
Lightweight Women’s Head Coach Heather B. Cartwright points out that the bridges can be especially exciting, even for unschooled spectators. “Around there everyone is so close to one another that there are some near collisions and spectacular near misses,” she explains.
When in doubt, look at the boats’ numbers.  “Each boat has a bow number, and if you see one that’s really out of order, they’ve been passing a lot of boats,” advises Amanda C. Pfabe ’10, the other Women’s Lightweight Co-Captain.
Though races take place throughout the weekend, most of the races that Harvard students compete in—clearly the most important—are during the afternoon on Sunday. “The Sunday afternoon races are really the pinnacle of the regatta,” explains Cartwright.
And, by the way, catching a crab refers to an oar cutting into the water at an angle and getting stuck. FM does not recommend catching crabs of any sort in the Charles.

“A good leader is decisive.” This appears as a full entry dated June 6, 2009. It’s listed under a section I labeled “Career Research” in my online Google Notebook. This is the specific tab where I’ve been keeping track of all such brilliant kernels of thought that I might want to bring up during a job interview this year. “Decisive”—what a good word. Now I’m employable.
Think of Google Notebook as a web-based version of your traditional Mead Five-Star, except, with this online adaptation, you can organize, order, and re-order every entry you make. You can easily paste in text from Web sites and articles, and most importantly, your notebooks are always just a few clicks away online—and you’ll never lose them.
If you’ve never used Google Notebook before, you’re out of luck unfortunately—development of the service was discreetly terminated in January 2009. As of now, past users can continue to access and update their notebooks, but the tech giant no longer supports new Notebook sign-ups nor actively aims to improve current features. I’m looking to move to other similar services soon, such as Evernote or Zoho Notebook. The motto of the former is “Sign in and start remembering everything.”
And it’s true, what is great about these services is that you feel no qualms about entering the most random thoughts and ideas into your notebook—things you would otherwise simply forget (and even forget you forgot). I have one notebook called “Misheard but Good Lyrics” for those occasional songs I listen to and think: Damn, that lyric would have been so much better if they had used this other word instead. Listen to “A Dustland Fairytale” by The Killers and tell me the phrase “night gown” shouldn’t be replaced with “night cap.” Sorry, it’s just a fact, and now you’ll never listen to this song the same way again.
For me, Google Notebook has become a sort of private Twitter—a repository for all the underdeveloped thoughts and ideas that come into my head during life at Harvard, but which I don’t feel like sharing with Frank209 and Sexygirl116. Don’t worry, Frank hasn’t shared much of his wisdom with me either. His only tweet so far reads: “I am part of the SOLUTION. I use much water based inks.”
I can’t say I’ve always had such a zeal for note taking though. In fact, I’ve never kept a diary or journal—dream or otherwise—and I seek to avoid taking notes in class whenever possible. When I first started using Google Notebook, I was only trying to keep track of the few memorable quotes that I would inevitably stumble upon while web browsing. An entry from July 2006 in my “Famous Quotes” notebook reads: “Every journalist has a novel in him, which is an excellent place for it. —Russel Lynes.”
Clearly, I have not since taken Mr. Lynes’s wisdom to heart, hence my notebook titled “Book Ideas.” In fact, since my humble beginnings collecting quotes, I’ve created dozens of other notebooks. There’s an idea for a Bud Light commercial in there somewhere and an extremely complicated prank idea I once devised to trick someone into thinking that they’ve traveled back in time.
I have an idea for a T-shirt company, a type of amusement park I’d like to see someone build, and five different types of online dating Web sites that I think could be profitable. Investing strategies, thesis topics, pick-up lines—you name it, I’ve probably written a note about it. One note I particularly like questions whether a hotel brand that would cater to America’s overweight population could succeed. Thoughts?
I’ll be the first to admit, some of my entries seem to border on the ridiculous. Apparently in 2007, I thought it would be wise to have a notebook called “Sports Lessons” in which I summarize the tips I picked up when taking a golf or tennis lesson. The one and only entry is from July 20 and reads: “Shot—keep back foot planted; stay balanced; don’t reach, let the ball come to your strike-zone; if you miss, miss long.” Fantastic. Good thing I have that written down.
Who knows? Maybe this won’t work out the way I’ve planned. Maybe I won’t end up writing commercials or working in the obesity hospitality sector and these notes will just go to waste. But just maybe I’ll end up writing a book about a guy who makes commercials for this very hotel chain. Who knows which random thought will have been worth jotting down?
An entry under “Original TV Ideas” reads: “If They Fought—A simulation of what would happen if two groups for whatever reason… fought. For example: Actual New England Patriots in the 18th century vs. actual Carolina panthers.” This is now a real show on Spike TV called “Deadliest Warrior”—I had nothing to do with its creation, of course, but hey, at least its existence means my ideas can’t be all that bad. Many of them are useless for sure, but you only need one great thought to make all of this collecting worthwhile.
I don’t think there is anything particularly unique about me that makes online notebooks compelling. I’m under the impression that Harvard students come up with world-changing ideas everyday. Maybe you’re walking to Sever, or just about to fall asleep at night. How many times have you forgotten something great because you didn’t want to get out a pen and paper—and then, what would have been the point, you would probably have lost the note anyway. Don’t let this happen again; get in the 21st century habit of remembering everything.
—James M. Wilsterman ’10  is an Economics Concentrator in Lowell House. He can’t even remember the last time he forgot something.

We all know the names of the rich and famous Harvard grads of years past, but lesser known are the blossoming talents among us. Jonathan A. Park ’13 is the lead singer and guitarist for the local, up-and-coming band The Naked Chips.
Founded in 2007, the funk/reggae/rock group has quickly evolved from garage band status, landing shows in various well-established Boston venues, including Kings, the All Asia Café, and the Midway Café. The band’s most recent success was the release of its first album, “All the Good,” on iTunes this past September.
“The most fun I’ve had in my life is when I’m playing shows,” said Park, smiling. “You get an adrenaline rush that I don’t really get from anything else. I just love the experience.”
This year, though, with members of The Naked Chips scattered throughout the country’s college towns, it’s been a challenge for the band to maintain its momentum.
“We’re pretty much on a break I would say,” commented the band’s bassist, Jake L. Mazur-Warren, who started at Skidmore this fall.
The band does hope to stick together, using school breaks and summer vacation to practice and perform.
“I think they have the potential to stick together,” said Park’s mother and self-proclaimed band groupie, Evie Weinstein-Park, “In addition to being great musicians together, they’ve become great friends together.”
But in the meantime, Park is looking for other kids to jam with here at Harvard.
“As long as I’m not with The Naked Chips,” said Park, “I’m definitely looking for other people to play with.”

Fall at Harvard means Head of the Charles, an abundance of midterms, and, of course, delicious seasonal drinks in the Square.  With such a wide range of choices, though, it can be difficult to discern the best pumpkin lattes and hot apple cider variations. Luckily, FM is here to help you choose the best of the bunch:
1. Peet’s Pumpkin Spice Latte—While it’s not as sweet as the Starbucks version, Peet’s Pumpkin Spice Latte’s full bodied aroma still evokes memories of your mom’s pumpkin pie. Supposedly, Burdick’s also offers a pumpkin spice latte, but they were completely out of it both times FM visited.
2. Tealuxe’s Chaider—Mostly consisting of apple cider, this drink is made much more interesting by the extra spices in the chai. Some might be overwhelmed by the combination of so many flavors, but we found it delightful.
3. Harpoon’s Octoberfest—A delicious and hearty beer that celebrates the season, Harpoon’s Octoberfest is perfect for when you need a taste of fall after 8 p.m. It’s available on tap at Tory Row.
4. Greenhouse Café’s Hot Apple Cider—Made from locally grown apples, one of the biggest perks is that this apple cider can be purchased with Board Plus. It’s pretty good too, with a delicious blend of sweet and tangy flavors.
5. Café Crema’s Golden Crema—A combination of cinnamon and honey, this drink offers an exciting change of pace from the typical cider and pumpkin drinks of the season. It wasn’t too sweet, and  definitely boasted the best presentation of all the drinks FM tried.
Now, it’s up to you to slip on your coziest sweater, grab your favorite drink, and head out to enjoy the foliage. After all, winter will probably be here before you get the chance to try them all!

The Harvard Policy Debate Team, originally called the Harvard Debate Council, was founded in 1892. This was the year the Johnson County War erupted between small farmers and large ranchers in Wyoming, and the year Homer Plessy sat in the wrong seat on a train and prompted a landmark Supreme Court case. These are things that debaters might know because they can never tell when their opponents will bring up the way mass media affected rebellions in the West, or why the Supreme Court isn’t a reliable source for expanding nuclear disarmament.
Dallas G. Perkins Jr., who coaches the policy debate team, told me that the debate council was founded in 1891, but he prefaced the statement with “I am told,” as in, his sources might be unreliable. Perkins has seen a lot of unreliable sources in his life, and he knows enough not to trust what he hears.
If you asked Dallas Perkins—whom I referred to in correspondence as Mr. Perkins, because he is an intimidating man and he signs his e-mails “DP”, which doesn’t really give someone a hint one way or another whether they’re allowed to use the first name—why the policy debate team is interesting, I think he would just ignore you. He would lift his straw hat from the table, place it on top of his head, say, “Have a good day,” and leave. He has better things to do.
The reason he needn’t answer is because it’s not a far leap to say that the team is a perfectly good paradigm for the continuation of an institution, the values of research, and talking really fast, the way people feel about things they did when they were younger, long careers, nuclear disarmament, the British government’s abuse of the Irish people, train rides, plane flights, offices in Quincy that lack windows, pancake houses in the Midwest, three-day tournaments in which people forget about things like breakfast, undying loyalty, national titles, never-ending glory. Dallas Perkins wouldn’t say these things because to him and others, they are obvious.
MAKING THE CASE
You see, I can’t decide whether to call him Dallas, or Perkins, or Mr. Perkins. It probably has to do with the circumstances under which I met him. He was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and a round straw hat that looked out of place in Au Bon Pain (or in Cambridge, for that matter). He said things that reminded me how little the policy debate team cared about publicity and how they occupied an entirely different sphere than other student organizations.
I didn’t know much about debate until about a month ago. This probably explains why I asked debaters silly questions that they all answered very patiently. Questions like, How do you guys prepare for a debate? How do the freshmen look this year? Who are your biggest rivals? What first sparked your interest in debate?
When I talked to the captain of the team, senior Geoff A. Smith ’10, he wore a green and white polo and talked with his hands. He seemed to be consciously slowing down his speech patterns so that I could perfectly understand him. He told me that this year, the team would be debating the following issue, as determined by the Cross Examination Debate Association, at all of its tournaments (he recited it from memory and I had to replay it three times on my recorder just to get it right): “The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal and/or substantially reduce or restrict the role and/or mission of its nuclear weapons arsenal.” I asked him, jokingly, if he could tell me some of the arguments that he uses (or would that compromise his position?).
He looked at me, serious and wide-eyed, paused, said, “I can probably tell you what we used at Georgia State last weekend.”
Policy debate is structured around two-person teams. One person does mostly affirmative, one mostly negative. Everybody debates on the same issue all year, so eventually the arguments are tailored to fit a certain team’s style. Tournaments are long and intense. The first round is on Saturday at 8 a.m. or 8:30. One round of debate can take around 2.5 hours with four debates a day. This happens for two days, while you compile a record and, at some point, break for lunch. The third day is elimination rounds, where the top 32 teams compete in a tournament-style bracket. Good teams will be debating until late Monday, when a champion is crowned. Younger teams book flights home early.
Some teams are so sure of their inferiority that they count on leaving early—potential Cinderellas filling out brackets weighted against them. It’s the hierarchy that debate creates, a world where the best pairs in the country are known by the combined initials of their last names. I began hearing the letters “PJ” uttered reverently for the first time. PJ said such and such, PJ were invited to a special tournament, PJ almost won.
An exemplary argument for the affirmative: “The US should increase the rate at which it dismantles nukes. At the moment, when we sign a treaty to dismantle, we basically just sign papers and put them (the nukes, not the papers) in a warehouse waiting to be dismantled, which could take now until 2040, because obviously it takes a while to take them apart, without blowing yourself up. Our argument is that it’s better for security not to have a large number of nukes around that we can’t protect.”
For the negative: “It’s an argument about deterrence. We need certain weapons and postures for deterrence. If you cut these weapons you cut our deterrence capability, which leads other countries to reassess their calculations, try to reach nuclear parity with the US.”
“That’s one of the arguments deployed,” he concludes. I can’t tell whether he’s using the word ironically.
But in this world, arguments are as dangerous as radiation and as swift as ballistic missiles, as are the curt phrases that punctuate them. Later, I will hear the story of the 1984 Northwestern Tournament from the man who won it, Jonathan B. Wiener ’84. The other team spoke at length about Cuban refugees intercepted by US patrol boats. Wiener and his partner parried with their own counter-plan, but its significance eluded their opponents. “I guess you missed the boat,” the Harvard team quipped. The audience collapsed in hysterics. It ruined the other team.
Such long-range attacks don’t materialize out of spontaneous witticism. Geoff described the summer of background reading, learning everything there is to know about the nuclear issue, and then as school got closer, beginning to zero in on specific arguments, searching for large quotes from obscure magazines, piecing the quotes together to make the case, then organizing them in files and sharing them among the team.
“You make sure your argument can take care of all different other arguments. You cobble your file together when you see what applies,” he said. “We’re going paperless now, but we used to carry four 14-gallon tubs to tournaments.” The tubs were filled with evidence, each sheet of paper called a card.
This brings me to something important. It was very clear from the beginning that these tournaments were essential to the debaters, the lifeblood of the activity. How could I write an article about the debate team without seeing the debaters in action? To use a line from sports writer Heywood Hale Broun, not only would I be veterinarian to the Light Brigade, but I’d be home tending the rabbits while the company was out in the field.
This was going to be an issue. Long articles need color. Color is easy to find at large events, easy to pick out in snatches of conversation (did you hear that PJ won again?), to distill from the clothes that people wear (did you see their matching shirts?). So I wrote some e-mails, plied some contacts and started imagining a plane ride to Kentucky, paid for by The Crimson. I’d sit behind the captain and coach, nestled among the younger team members, jotting down exceptionally good quotes, helping to carry the evidence tubs when we departed. At the debates I’d sit in a corner, watch PJ dazzle the audience and their opponents.
Then I got an e-mail from a sophomore on the team who said, you’d better talk to Dallas.
MEETING THE MASTERMIND
So I sent the man an e-mail (Hi Mr. Perkins, My name is etc.), and the coach answered quickly and directly: “Sure. Do you want to talk on the phone or in person?” I told him I’d meet him in front of ABP the next morning, and I’d have on a gray Mets cap.
The next morning I ran out the door fumbling with my tape recorder, forgetting to put on my gray cap. I arrived in front of ABP turning in circles, looking for someone who might look like a debate coach. But it was Perkins who found me. Apparently my hair looked like it fit with an Italian name.
In ABP we sat down across from each other at a plastic table. This was my first interview with a debate person, before Geoff and his patient helpfulness, so I asked informational questions, and then just some silly ones.
For example: “My roommate, he’s on mock trial and did debate in high school. He told me, very cryptically, [short laugh] to ask you about something called the Emory Switch and if Harvard uses any special tactics.”
Perkins: [Pauses. Looks at me. It really wasn’t a good question and he and I both know it.] The Emory Switch was something that was invented before you and your roommate were born. It refers to the fact that...Apparently, way back when, debaters from Emory used to switch the order of their speeches and bash their opponents first. It did, however, get Perkins talking about how the Harvard team isn’t really characterized by any single approach to argument. This is in contrast to teams like the inner city Baltimore college that talks about race, or Cal State Fullerton, which focus on “radical stuff, very lefty,” or Oklahoma, where debaters bring up Heidegger and Nietzsche.
This was the part where my voice recorder ran out of battery, and it was also near the end of my questions. So I started to wrap it up and closed my notebook.
He looked at me and said, “That’s it?”
I was startled, and started babbling something about this just being a first interview and I was trying to learn something about the team and—
“Well you haven’t learned anything,” he interrupted. “You don’t know the size of the team. You have one name (he had given me Geoff’s e-mail address). What do you know?”
Beyond the philosophical implications of his question I had to admit that he was right. I think this was where I threw in my request to go to a tournament so I could see the debate team up close, maybe get to know something. It seemed to be a logical rejoinder.
This was the part where he told me, all in the calmest and most collected voice, that the team had had a Crimson reporter who’d come to a tournament before. He embarrassed the team and they had to spend the next month explaining to other teams how they were not assholes, it was just the reporter who was an asshole. Perkins asked me what my agenda was, and at some point I asked what he was insinuating. When he left, he lifted his straw hat off the table, put it on his head, and said simply, “Have a good day.”
SEARCHING FOR THE HEAVY HITTERS
I hadn’t had any idea that The Crimson had run a story on the Policy Debate Team before, much less a controversial one. Finding the article was easy. The first paragraph is entirely devoted to Dallas Perkins and the slightly illegal dealings of his father who had “clowned” Texas. The need for that opening could be found in the first line of the second paragraph, which proclaimed that today, Perkins “is running his own gang of outlaws.” (This earlier writer had no qualms concerning what to call the coach, dropping the confident “Perkins” after the first paragraph and proceeding to rely on the familiar “Dallas”).
I thought this was what Perkins had taken issue with, or maybe the tongue-in-cheek references to drugs. Instead, the coach told me, the problem was the caricatures of the other teams, who were made to look foolish compared to the Harvard debaters.
Looking back over the article, I guess he was probably right. But for me the article was interesting because it underscored the dramatic rise of that year’s top pair, KT (last names Klinger and Tarloff), for whom the horizon was rapidly expanding, with the national championships imminent, and great things about to come.
Though the piece was written in 2005, it shone a new light on the current policy team, bringing PJ into focus. These were the two who had been last standing at Georgia State the weekend before. These were the two whom all the excitement was about. The best Harvard has seen in years. And there was no way I was going to get to see them perform, not after the fiasco of the last reporter to cling along for a tournament.
I went to the archives and found names of old debaters. I sent out some e-mails. The archives have a folder for nearly everything, including Policy Debate. There were fliers from the ’50s advertising debates on nuclear weapons (again!), Richard Nixon as president, the abolition of the House Un-American Activities Committee, the treatment of the Irish by the British government. There were fraying newspapers mentioning old national champions. There was even a form sent by the secretary of the Debate Council, in 1947, to other universities for the purpose of organizing the next year’s debates. The cutoff slip at the bottom, to be sent back quickly to Wigglesworth G-32, had a space to write in the name of the person who was answering the letter. It had the word “Mr.” followed by a blank line.
But none of this could help me visualize PJ. I decided to cold e-mail them, without going through the captain or coach first. Geoff had told me their civilian names: Alex A. Parkinson ’11 and Eli J. Jacobs ’11. They e-mailed back quickly, but they were too busy to meet with me (schoolwork and prepping for tournaments). I could imagine them sitting at vast, thickly papered desks, sifting through files, and passing folders back and forth.
When I interviewed Cata Santos ’12, Geoff Smith’s debate partner, I tried to put PJ out of my head. Cata said things like, “You can think of debate as a game. Sometimes you have to play affirmative, sometimes you have to play negative. That’s just life.” When she says “topicality” she traces a “T” with her fingers, and when she reaches a driving point in her argument she pinches the tops of her fingers together. To explain why she loves debate, and what her favorite moments are, she says, “Okay. PJ is debating in octofinals, they’re the only Harvard debaters left in the tournament. Octofinals was at something like 7 a.m. on Monday morning, so you’ve been getting five hours of sleep for three days. Coaches stay up almost all night doing work for us. So at that point most debaters are just exhausted. If they’re not debating they’re asleep. But for me, the best moment is when, despite all that, everyone is up at 7 a.m. and the whole team is there for two people, getting them food, highlighting, making sure they have water, everything they need. So when the whole team is cooperating . . . it really feels like a team. Even not being Alex or Eli it’s great, everyone loves that.”
At the end Cata showed me the results from the last tournament and there they were, Harvard PJ, to be facing Emory IW in the seventh round. I pointed and Cata nodded and said, “PJ, isn’t that a great name? Alex and Eli, you should see them together. They’re so good.”
I nodded.
“Yeah, they’re tall and slender, and . . .” Cata trails off. Earlier she had tried to describe what made them so good and found it hard to put a finger on.
FINDING THE HALL-OF-FAMERS
One night I got an e-mail back from Michael B. King ’79, one of the alumni I had asked to talk about the team. He wrote, “Sure! My schedule is a bit choppy this week (I am traveling to Philly tomorrow evening), but we should be able to make something work.” Soon I get another e-mail from someone I had not contacted, John M. Bredehoft ’80, who had been debate partners with Mike when they were back in college. Because the e-mails are all in a chain I can see the correspondence between the two: King wrote to his friend, “Did you get one of these? If not, mind if I send him your way? Good lord, this would be like somebody on the Crimson staff of 1979 getting in touch with a Harvard debater from . . . Truman’s day!”
Bredehoft responded, “This is wonderful! Send him along!"
They were debate partners at Harvard when King was a senior and Bredehoft was a junior, and that year, in 1979, they won the National Debate Tournament. King was writing to me as he was traveling to Philadelphia, and he took a break during the flight. When he got back to the computer he said, “I see that in the interim John has responded, and I will resist reading.” At times, in the middle of their narratives, they would ask questions of each other, checking that their facts were accurate.
King came from a long line of debaters, documented back to his grandfather who won a two volume history of the French Revolution for winning the LaHaye Seminary’s debating prize in April of 1899. Bredehoft debated successfully for Spellman High School in the Bronx, where Justice Sotomayor went, although they didn’t overlap.
Upon winning nationals, they earned an article in the Lexington Herald, which reported that “the debaters rattled off their points faster than an auctioneer at a tobacco warehouse.”
By all accounts these men were among the best. Looking back at my notes from the archives, I realized that their names popped up everywhere—in snippets of articles, in alumni newsletters. They were PJ, 30 years ago.
They had remained close over the years. They were meeting up in Virginia within the month. For a decade they have collaborated on an “alternate history” project (e.g. if Hitler had declared peace with America). They sent me over 7,000 words, and I can’t begin to pick what to include: the fact that they argued way back then that global warming was a real phenomenon? That they and their fellow debaters go to each other’s weddings and anniversaries? Or: van rides back to Cambridge over Thanksgiving singing Christmas carols; eating pancakes at an off-the-road-diner in Western Pennsylvania; “working all-nighters in the concrete block debate office of that era, windowless, in the basement of Quincy House”; “emerging for breakfast at dawn to continue a discussion on the First Amendment implications of noise regulation, or exhausted but exalting over having discovered a data error in the latest unpublished study on the effects of unemployment on stress-related illness”; or “just standing in front of the mimeograph machine and chatting about life in general for hours on end.” “Do you know what a mimeograph machine is?” Bredehoft asked in parentheses. If I could not see PJ this was the next best thing: letters from these reincarnations from the past.
“ANOTHER THING ALTOGETHER”
There will always be pairs of top debaters, but over the past 30 years the one constant has been Dallas. In searching for a good anecdote about her coach, Cata kept harping on his old straw hat. When I said he was an intimidating man, Geoff agreed and said he’d felt the same way at first. Both of them stressed the fact that he was direct and honest and really cared. Cata said that every once in a while he wears pink or green suits, artifacts from the 70’s. Bredehoft puts it best: “Dallas was another thing altogether—Dallas is Dallas, and there is no way around it.” He continues: “He was the first coach of Harvard Debate for many years not to have been a Harvard debater (he went to Georgetown, then Harvard Law). When I first met him in the mid-1970s, he was partial to wearing one-piece pastel jumpsuits and had light orange hair down to his knees. Incongruously, when he spoke it was in one of the most pronounced West Texas drawls ever heard (he comes from Impact, Texas, outside Abilene). I remember someone making a cheesy movie about debate—“Talk to Me”?—called Dallas to see what the Harvard debate coach sounded like. Needless to say, the drawl and hair did not make it to the screen. Appearances notwithstanding, his mind was and is razor-sharp; his instinct about argument unerring, and his dedication to debate boundless.”
Our last interaction was over e-mail. He asked if we had arranged sufficient interviews. I asked him how many people were on the team. I also wanted to know if I could look at the team’s own archives, somewhere in one of the river houses’ subterranean depths, and he said, “I don’t know if there’s anything to ‘check out.’ Who told you there was stuff in the Adams basement? I have no knowledge/memory of that.” He signed it “dp.”
As I write this he’s at a tournament. It’s twenty to two, so he and the other debaters have probably grabbed a quick lunch and are going on the fuel of coffee and donuts from the early morning. Dallas is probably listening carefully to arguments, watching one of his teams of two, PJ or SS or one of the others. Maybe one of them is at a podium, and the other is sifting through files, searching for the right evidence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Drawing attention to the idea of health security during an era of pandemics, Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health Julio Frenk yesterday called for “reform in the midst of a storm.”
In a public address at the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum, Frenk, an international leader in public health, focused on the need for change due to the interdependent nature of global health.
“The world is becoming a single neighborhood,” he said. “Globally, the most complex challenge will be to secure access to the H1N1 vaccine for all in need throughout the world. More damaging than the pandemic itself could be a situation where the wealthy countries have a sufficient supply of the vaccine, while the rest of the world suffers in impotence and resentment.”
Health remains one of the “truly universal aspirations” in a turbulent world, Frenk added.
“It’s really a way of saying it’s time for a novel way of engaging the new political challenges with new political solutions,” said Debbie P. Lin ’11, a history of science concentrator who attended the event. Lin said she was most impacted by Frenk’s focus on global interdependence.
According to Frenk, through health security—epidemiological security, health-care security, and financial security—nations could invest in protection from bankruptcy and debt. This would improve safety and quality care while promoting prevention and wellness.
“History teaches us that many of the most enlightened social protection measures have been enacted at times of economic or political crises,” Frenk said. “If well crafted, health reform can be a key ingredient in economic recovery.”
Frenk, who is a former minister of health of Mexico, referred to the 1995 financial meltdown in Mexico as an example of how change could occur in a time of crisis.
Conditional cash transfers, a universal health system, and a new public health agency were effectively created to protect against major health risks.
Many audience members supported Frenk’s remarks on the need for global health reform.
“If you keep doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results, that’s called insanity,” said Brian “Ari” Cole, a Kennedy School alumnus. “We gotta change our methods! We have to mix it up!”
“It really boils down to this: all life is interrelated,” Frenk said Frenk, quoting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
He then concluded, “Let us continue to weave together the destiny of better health for every person in this country and in every corner of our interrelated world. Our generation has no task more urgent or important than to achieve comprehensive health security for all.”

The investigation of an alleged $80 million theft of a Harvard doctor’s art collection has taken yet another bizarre turn, with the Boston Globe now reporting that officials are looking into whether the doctor’s business partner is to blame.
The line of inquiry comes just two weeks after former Harvard Medical School instructor Ralph Kennaugh and his business partner Angelo B. Amadio said that $80 million worth of artwork was stolen from their home in California. Last week, investigators identified the alleged victims as possible suspects in the case, but last Friday, the Globe reported that Amadio may have stolen the art from Kennaugh, according to the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office. The Sheriff’s Office would not confirm this report when contacted.
During a press conference last week, Commander Mike Richards said that several of Amadio’s statements have been false and inconsistent. Amadio’s background has also come into question. Richards said that Amadio is “reportedly a venture capitalist,” and has “a number of scams related to him.”
The investigators have asked Kennaugh and Amadio to take polygraph tests but they have both declined, according to Richards.
“The bottom line is that this is a simple investigation that could have been made a lot easier with the cooperation of the victims,” Richards said at the press conference. “We’ve been blocked all the way on this thing.”
According to David St. John, the insurance consultant who was responsible for buying insurance for the artwork, Kennaugh and Amadio refused to take polygraph tests because they are part of a small corporation.
St. John would not reveal the names of the corporation’s members, but did say that because all members of the corporation would be required to take the test, and that because one member objected, neither Kennaugh nor Amadio would take the test.
Following the press conference last week, Kennaugh and Amadio indicated that they would be more cooperative, according to Richards. On Oct. 9, Kennaugh and Amadio released a document listing the artwork that had been stolen, but Richards said he could not verify the authenticity of the document.
St. John said that he has seen the artwork and believes the artwork to be real.
“[Kennaugh and Amadio] are not some blue collar people that have copies of Van Gogh on their wall like a motel,” he said.
On Oct. 6 Kennaugh and Amadio gave the police a typed-ransom note that they said they had found behind a painting that had not been stolen. Richards said that they have conducted full fingerprinting analysis of the note. Additionally, the police say they have determined that there was no entry at the alleged point of break in.
But St. John asserted the innocence of Kennaugh and Amadio and accused the police department for “incompetence” in the investigation process. St. John alleges that the police failed to fingerprint the apartment until four days after the theft was reported.
Richards said that the FBI and Interpol have been consulted on the case, but that the investigation is still being conducted by the Sheriff’s office.
“Why would [the Sheriff’s office] talk to the FBI if they believed the pieces didn’t exist?” St. John asked.
He later added, “The sheriff’s department is pulling up a smokescreen. They were caught with their britches down and now they are trying to cover it up by turning the blame on Kennaugh and Amadio.”
Both the Sheriff’s office and St. John agree that the case is complicated. “We feel manipulated,” Richards said.
But St. John said, “Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Or perhaps I should say something is rotten in the Monterey county.”

This weekend will see hundreds of thousands of spectators flock to the banks of the River Charles for the annual Head of The Charles weekend.
This weekend marks the 45th annual Head of the Charles Regatta, an event which saw more than 300,000 spectators come to watch 8,200 rowers compete last year.
Harvard crew teams treat this event as a “fun” chance to participate in a race that involves all levels of participants.
“We want everyone to be able to participate and don’t necessarily try to select the best possible crew” said Harry Parker, the men’s head coach.
“More often than not rowers will be able to row with their classmates.”
But for the less athletically inclined Harvard student, there will still be many opportunities to share in the festivities this weekend.
Numerous food and beverage vendors will line the banks of the river, and this will mark the first year of the Eliot Bridge Enclosure—a hospitality tent that will set back participants $60 each day to enjoy food and other amenities.
Other attractions will include the Rowing and Fitness Expo tent which will have new exercise clothing, and the Weld Exhibition where official sponsors of the Head Of The Charles will offer free samples of their products.
Various university and preparatory school alumni associations will be renting out tents in a spectator area named the “Reunion Village.”
Thomas C. Foley Jr. ’13, an alumnus of Phillips Academy Andover, is planning to visit the Village.
“It is a great way to get back together with the kids who are still rowing at Andover,” he said.
The weekend holds a large economic and cultural significance for the city of Cambridge as an event that attracts people from around the world.
“For the city itself it is a great tourism boost and the hospitality sector really starts to benefit,” said Jim Connelly, the press officer for the regatta.
“The event will give people the opportunity to learn what is going on in Cambridge and Boston” said Jason M. Weeks, executive director for the Cambridge Arts Council.
“[The regatta] has become a very beloved event and people have come to plan their fall around the Head Of The Charles.”

One of Harvard Square’s most convenient alcohol providers is now under different management. C’est Bon, the convenience store located at 1432 Mass Ave, has been reacquired by former owner George Sarkis.
The store, which is open until 2:30 a.m. on weekends, has been a Harvard landmark “for twenty years,” according to Sarkis. It sells a variety of food items and liquors and is a popular student destination for alcohol and late-night snacks.
Sarkis sold the store eighteen months ago to launch a snack food business, Healthy Life Snacks. He said that he bought C’est Bon back because the management that was running it after his departure was not doing well.
Sarkis said he is excited about the prospect of running C’est Bon once again.
Yesterday afternoon, he was in the store speaking with a saleswoman about signs and banners for new products, taking down a sign in the front of the door to make room for three new signs, and making measurements of space outside the store for new advertisements and posters.
“There will be major changes in the store coming this week,” he said.
Sarkis added that one of the reasons for the changes is to increase the number of student customers.
“We need to get the students back here,” he said.
Students have echoed the need for changes, citing high prices as their principal qualm with the establishment.
“It’s too expensive,” said Shawn J. Hilgendorf ’10.
“It’s expensive” said Kevin J. McCarthy ’10, “but Doma is more expensive. Also, C’est Bon has more expensive types of alcohol, like handles and beer, than other places.”
Sarkis said that the reason for the relatively high prices is the store’s location.
“My rent is very high. We’re right in the middle of Harvard Square,” he explained.
But Sarkis said he is ready to resolve the issue of price. He said that he understands students are used to lower prices back home.
“We will have lower prices, a wider variety of alcohol and food items, and a greater selection,” he said.
Sarkis also spoke about ideas for student discounts. “There will be a special discount for Harvard students with Harvard IDs,” he said. “We will continue to strictly ID students.”
He added that in the future he intends to operate under a slightly different name—“C’est Bon Market and Liquors.”

Harvard College is trying to make it a bit easier for parents to stay on top of campus news that may affect their children’s lives.
Today the College is releasing a new parents’ tab on the recently redesigned College Web site, which will provide a collection of information and links relevant to undergraduates’ parents.
The Web site is in part designed to mitigate parents’ concerns about the potential risks of H1N1 influenza at Harvard and to help the spread of information pertaining to the disease. The University also recently created a phone hotline for parents to call with questions about H1N1.
In addition to the latest Harvard Gazette story about the prevalence of H1N1 on campus, the parents’ tab currently contains a letter from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and an article written by an undergraduate student. The second page of the site provides parents with a detailed list of relevant links meant to help them navigate Harvard’s sometimes complicated network of resources.
Parents will also be able to register for a newsletter and other updates from the College designated for parents.
College spokesman Jeff A. Neal said that he hoped that the section would be a “one-stop online resource center.”
“We recognized that it wasn’t entirely clear to parents where they should go for information,” he said.
The administration has been working on developing the parents’ section since August, Neal added.
The new tab comes as part of an effort by the College to improve its online presence. On August 27, the same day that freshmen arrived on campus, the College released a redesigned Web site. The setup of the new Web site allows the college to more easily update the site’s content, said FAS Communications Specialist Amy A. Lavoie.
Besides the new parents’ tab, the College Web site includes tabs directing visitors to pages such as academics, admissions, and my.harvard.edu.

Sometimes winning is not everything. In a game that was expected to be a one-sided battle, the Harvard field hockey team (4-7, 1-2 Ivy) held its own in a 3-1 loss to Boston University (6-8, 2-0 America East) last night. Although the scoreboard indicated a Terrier victory, the Crimson achieved a game-high 10 penalty corners and rose to the challenge against a very talented team.
“I think it was a really well-played game, an exciting 70 minutes,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “Boston University is very athletic, and is a strong, fast team, but we played tactically and executed our game plan.”
“Boston University was coming to push us around,” freshman goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “But we were very physical with them and had tons of [penalty] corners and scoring opportunities.”
Despite a higher number of penalty corner chances than its Boston opponent, the Crimson was unable to translate the opportunities into goals.
“We need to focus on scoring on corners,” co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon said. “We generated a lot of offense, but we need to finish and execute chances.”
Boston University dominated the early play, keeping the ball in its possession for the vast majority of the first half.
The Terriers’ break came at 28:38 into the first period with a goal from defender Jacinda McLeod, her fourth on the season, off of an assist from teammate Nikki Lloyd. Tassopoulos was able to make the initial save on the penalty corner, but McLeod capitalized on an easy rebound, putting the ball away into the lower right corner.
The Crimson squad also had a late chance to make a mark on the scoreboard, earning three penalty corners in the last two minutes of first-half play. But Boston University goalkeeper Amanda Smith and the defense shut down each Harvard chance. On the second corner, Smith took a shot in the chest from junior Crimson standout Chloe Keating, preserving the Terriers’ 1-0 lead.
The second half saw two more Boston University scores, the first coming in the early minutes after the starting whistle. Maryette Stuart collected the ball on a pass from Lloyd and banked in a goal off of Tassopoulos that barely cleared the crossbar, and was ruled a score after several minutes of deliberation among the game officials.
The third and final Terrier goal came again from McLeod, who tipped a shot over Tassopoulos’ shoulder into the net at 50:01. The score came from a penalty shot and off of a combination of assists from Haley Robinson and Allie Dolce.
Sophomore midfielder Carly Dickson helped Harvard eventually find its scoring form in the 23rd minute of the second half. Dickson took advantage of a one-two assist from sophomore Georgia McGillivray and co-captain Kristin Bannon on a penalty corner.
Overall, Boston University outshot the Crimson, 21-13.
While Harvard came up short offensively, a positive aspect of the game was Tassopoulos’ stellar performance in goal. The freshman was recently named Ivy League Rookie of the Week and has been consistently rising to the test of college-level play.
“[Cynthia] has been showing really great leadership,” Caples said. “She’s a smart, poised, and composed player, and, even as a freshman, has been keeping us in games.”
But outstanding results from Tassopoulos may not be ideal.
“I think we’re giving up too many shots and don’t want Cynthia to look that good.” Caples quipped. “As a team, we’re giving too many second and third opportunities. We need to take care of the ball.”
In addition, the Harvard team, led by Tassopoulos’ defense, is steadily improving.
“I don’t think our record shows the progress we’ve made,” Goodman-Bacon said. “I think we are improving a lot as a team and our skill is getting so much better each game.”
“We have a losing record, but we’ve been progressing,” Tassopoulos agreed. “We’ve played top schools like UMass, Michigan, and now BU, and have kept the games tight. We’re really stepping up and playing to their level.”

The sixth-ranked Harvard men’s soccer team suffered its worst defeat of the year last night with a 4-0 loss at No. 17 Connecticut (7-2-3, 5-1-1 Big East). The Crimson (8-2-1, 1-0-1 Ivy) was shut out for just the second time this year, and it was also the first game this season in which it gave up more than one goal.
The team had only given up four goals in its 10 previous games this fall.
“[The Huskies] were opportunistic early, scored a bunch of goals, and they don’t give up goals very easily,” Harvard coach Jamie Clark said. “They’re a very stubborn team.”
Harvard managed just two shots on goal against Connecticut goalie Josh Ford, as opposed to nine for the Huskies. Connecticut’s defense held the Crimson to 12 shots total, after Harvard came in averaging almost 18 per game.
Despite holding preseason All-American midfielder Toni Stahl to just one shot on goal, the Crimson defense could not contain the Huskies.
Co-captain Andre Akpan called it a “humbling experience.”
“You don’t want these games,” Akpan said. “But they happen, and it should give us some fuel for the [next] game.”
Junior Alan Ponce and freshman Carlos Alvares did all the scoring for the Huskies, with two goals and an assist each.
The duo scored back-to-back goals in the 33rd and 34th minutes, with Ponce putting one into the top right corner and Alvarez kicking one that went off sophomore goalie Austin Harms’ extended hand and into the net.
Alvarez scored after a nice move by freshman Stephanie Diop, who dodged two defenders on the far side of the field and completed a pass to his teammate.
After that, the Huskies never looked back.
Connecticut went into the half with a 2-0 lead, then picked up where it left off.
Ponce scored again 10 minutes into the second half off a nice pass from Greg King, with a cross shot to the left of the diving Harms.
Alvarez added his second off of a give-and-go with Ponce at the 88-minute mark.
Diop had two assists for the Huskies, and Mike Pezza and Shawn Nicklaw added assists as well.
It was the Connecticut defense’s sixth consecutive shutout and ninth of the year.
“It was hard to generate offense through the midfield,” Akpan said. “That’s something we have to work on.”
Harms came into the game with four shutouts and a 0.44 goals-against average, ranking him fourth in the nation. His .862 save percentage coming in was good for 15th in the country.
Despite giving up four goals, Clark said he still had full confidence in his goalie, adding that “he made a couple of nice saves, to be honest, today.”
Akpan explained that a possible reason for the loss was an overestimation of the Huskies.
“You know, I think we maybe gave [them] a little bit too much credit,” he said. “We didn’t work the way we should’ve, didn’t play with real confidence on the ball...it was a poorly played game all around.”
It was the Crimson’s third game against a ranked opponent this season. The squad defeated then-No. 14 Boston University, 1-0, on Sept. 11, then lost to then-No. 3 Wake Forest, 1-0, on Sept. 26.
From here, things don’t get any easier for the Crimson.
Up next, Harvard faces a crucial Ivy League test as it matches up against No. 15 Brown at home on Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
“We’re not a different team than we were a week ago,” Clark said. “We won’t change too much [versus Brown]. We want to get back to what we do well, which is pressuring and defending, and that will be the focus of our next two [practice] sessions.”
There will be no overestimation amongst the members of the team anymore.
“Brown’s going to be a hard working team,” Akpan added. “So we have to step up our [game] because it’s going to be a battle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the biting November wind rippled through the stands of Harvard Stadium last fall, an era was ending. A war of attrition had been fought and the Crimson had emerged victorious over the visiting Yale Bulldogs, sealing its place as Ivy League co-champions. Senior fifth-year quarterback Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 walked off of the field to take his place in the record books as 2008 Ivy League Player of the Year, accompanied by his second-in-command, fellow fifth-year senior Liam O’Hagan.
The Pizzotti-O’Hagan dynasty had ended, and as September ushered in the start of a new season, a question lingered in the minds of the Crimson faithful—who on earth is Collier Winters?
Winters, a junior from Claremore, Okla., was the one chosen to fill the lofty offensive gap left by the departed Pizzotti and O’Hagan. After a few sloppy scrimmages with an offense that was far from being cohesive, Winters’ debut at quarterback was a disappointing 27-20 loss over then-No. 23 Holy Cross.
Watching from the sidelines, I didn’t have much hope for the Crimson’s three-peat bid for Ivy League champions. Sure, Collier was fast, but the 5’11, 190-pound quarterback was built more like his coalition of sturdy running backs—Gino Gordon, Treavor Scales and Cheng Ho all clock in around 5’10, 190 lbs—than the 6’5 Pizzotti.
In fact, Winters doesn’t just look like a running back, he used to be a running back. Growing up idolizing players like Barry Sanders and Edgerrin James, the Oklahoman spent the first seven years of his football career carrying the ball as a tailback.
Then, as Winters began his first season at Booker T. Washington High School, his combination junior-high-and-high-school coach stepped in, and encouraged the athlete to change positions. Luckily for the Crimson—whom Winters has led to victories over Brown, Lehigh and Cornell, being named Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week along the way—Winters’ coach knew him well enough to foresee his success at quarterback. That coach was former Kansas State linebacker and the Oklahoman’s father, Kevin Winters.
“[Collier] played running back, but when we were home we spent hours learning how to throw the ball properly,” Kevin Winters said. “I anticipated that when he got older, his natural position would be as a quarterback. [In high school] he was ready to be quarterback because he had spent all that time learning how to throw and learning the nuances of being a quarterback.”
Winters’ father had made a good judgment call, and Winters transitioned easily into his new role as a signal caller. He set school records for passing yards and touchdown passes in his junior year, and was two-time team MVP and a member of the Tulsa World All-Metro and All-State teams.
However, along with his newfound aptitude for playmaking, Winters also became wary of the heightened pressure of being a quarterback. From his first foray into this position up through his time calling the shots for the Crimson, Winters has had to bear the burden of responsibility for both his team’s successes and failures.
“You definitely get a lot more attention focused on you [as quarterback],” Collier Winters said. “Either with the win or the loss, you get more credit than you should.”
In light of the impressive tenures of Pizzotti and O’Hagan, Winters has had all eyes on him during his first four weeks as Harvard’s starting quarterback.
“A lot of people see it as a lot of pressure and trying to live up to the standards that [Pizzotti and O’Hagan] set,” Winters said. “I would love to have the career that Chris [Pizzotti] had, but we’re different quarterbacks with different styles. I think that takes a little bit of pressure off.”
While Winters relies on his quick speed and running game, his recent Ivy League successes have positioned him as the legitimate successor of the Crimson’s former playmakers. From running back to Ivy League standout, it seems that Collier’s father was right all along.

It's now officially October 15, and that means....
You have less than 24 hours to turn in your application to stay on campus for J-term. Confusion has surrounded the housing decision process since even before the application was released earlier this semester, with some officials suggesting a thesis guaranteed a spot on campus come January. Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer has said thesis writers will need to demonstrate a "clear need" to be at Harvard, but what exactly that means, remains unclear.
As of the end of last month, 800 people had applied. And with the College repeatedly saying they will try to keep the number of students on campus at around 1,000, this isn't a deadline to play chicken with.
Plus the application is mad short.

Go ahead, make all the women's rugby jokes you can think of. The female variety of one of the world's most brutal sports often meets with a bit of skepticism, but the Radcliffe Rugby Football Club (Rad Rugby for short) couldn't care less.
The New England Rugby Football League (NERFU) Northeast Division 2 squad is off to a torrid start and has launched itself into the national rankings with a 3-0 campaign thus far. As of Oct. 1, Rugby Magazine had Rad Rugby pegged as the third best team in the nation among D-II squads—the highest mark ever in a decade for the Crimson women—and this ranking certainly won't drop after the squad's latest victory at home against Bates on Sunday. Read on after the jump to hear some player's thoughts on the achievements of the season so far.
Psych! Flyby has not been privileged enough to hear Rad Rugby's thoughts on the season, as numerous phone calls and emails to the squad's captains were not returned.
Rugby Magazine cautions against getting too carried away with its early evaluation of the teams, though, as the highly competitive playoffs loom ahead. Like many club teams at Harvard, Rad Rugby finds itself in the midst of a fundraiser in order to garner sufficient support for its bid to attend Nationals in April.
While Flyby may feel slighted by the media snub, it will look on eagerly as the Radcliffe women continue their quest for collegiate glory.

It's Friday night. It's been a long week, and the dubious food of the Hong Kong Restaurant beckons. This week, the Cambridge Chronicle carried an excellent write-up of how not to proceed...
The officer intervened and told the suspect that he was not welcome and needed to leave because he was intoxicated but the suspect refused, blocking the door and preventing other patrons from coming or going.
Flybyblog doesn't know quite what to make of the incident but we've got more pictures to prove that it probably wasn't a great idea after the jump.
It's been a tiring year for the Cambridge Police Department, so FlyBy will not contest Mushlin's choice to wind down at the Kong on a Friday night. In fact, there is at least a 50 percent likelihood that FlyBy will wind up at the Kong at 2 a.m. once midterms are over. We just hope we don't have to leave in this kind of shape...

Mr. Bartley said he got a call this morning informing him that eight Olympic rowers would be stopping by his joint for a quick bite later that day. He obliged, of course. What did they order? "Burgers." Why did we even bother to ask?
Eight renowned rowers from all over the world convened at Bartley's to grab lunch around 1 p.m. today. "The Great Eight," as the international set is known, will compete in the Championship Men's Eight race at the Head of the Charles this weekend. The lumbering athletes were spread out over two tables in the back corner of the critically acclaimed burger spot—and FlyBy got to join them for a bit as they chowed down.
"It's a great opportunity to have some fun and learn more about each other," said Alan Campbell, a British sculler who came in 5th in the men's 2000m individual scull at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. "We're friendly...sports should be like that. Competitors should be able to respect each other."
So where did the idea come from? Well, Fred Schoch, executive director for the Head Of The Charles, decided that he wanted to bring together the international rowing medalists from the Beijing Olympics, according to HOCR international liaison Bradway Widing, who lingered outside Bartley's to ensure that the rowers' lunch proceeded smoothly. The result: The Great Eight.
"We're the everyman's team," Campbell said, noting that the student population at Harvard—a "multi-national" institution—could be appropriate cheerleaders for the boat.
"They should get a burger made out of them," Widing said. "But I don't know what they would look like."
Indeed, a burger of such international scope may be far too complex to fit comfortably into the traditional two-bun model. Find out more about the illustrious Great Eight's sentiments about its forthcoming race, after the jump:
"The mental hardness of these guys is just incredible," said Phil Rowley, who is coaching the team alongside Bill Barry. "They're like gladiators."
The members of the team are as follows: Tim Maeyens (Belgium), Alan Campbell (Britain), Lassi Karonen (Sweden), Marcel Hacker (Germany), Mahe Drysdale (New Zealand), Warren Anderson (U.S.A.), Onderj Synek (Czech Republic), Iztok Cop (Slovenia). Ali Williams, a Harvard lecturer, heads up the boat as the coxswain.
The Great Eight collaborated with the Head Of The Charles in an outreach program this afternoon at Community Rowing, Inc. The team, which is staying at the Liberty Hotel in Boston, is sponsored by Concept2, a manufacturer of indoor rowers and racing oars.
"Everybody should come out and give us a shout," Campbell said. "They can shout, 'Go Scullers!'"
But according to Widing, the team is confident that it will win—and some of them have even been "talking smack."
Anderson put it quite simply:  "We don't need luck."
Having seen these athletic geniuses pack down burgers in a matter of minutes, we just might have to agree.

Future YDN-reporter Jacob: “Have you been reading my blog?”
Stunning young ingénue Rachel: “Of course not. You’re a gossip monger, and your blog is nothing but trash and lies.”
Read on for this week's trash and lies (spoliers ahead).
When Will and Sue decide to each direct their own numbers for sectionals, Sue realizes that “the minority students” are feeling unheard, and decides to sow discord, picking an all-minority team and finally allowing Kurt and Mercedes to “try something a little more black.” Drama ensues. After publicly accusing Mr. S. of “bigotry” and burning his music, Sue vows to get him fired. On his lovable wife’s advice, Mr. Schue gets “down in the gutter” and flunks almost all the Cheerios. Turns out girls are “functionally illiterate” -- one misspelled her name and drew sombreros as her answers in Will’s Spanish class. Surprisingly, Principal Figgins finally puts his foot down, ending Sue’s “free passes.” He even forbids her from picking up and throwing a child during her ensuing tantrum! Is there no end to his tyranny?
Meanwhile, Finn and Quinn are growing apart, and it gets nasty. “Why can’t you be more about Rachel?” he snaps. Quinn pounces on the competition, but Rachel won’t have any of it, and calling her out for working against glee with Sue: “Every time you whisper in her ear, you empower her to do more damage.” Last week it was sweet when Rachel tried to present New Directions as a refuge, but she’s quickly finding it empowering that glee will be Quinn’s only sanctuary when Sue finds out about the baby. In related news, Terri and her awful, awful sister Kendra exploit small-town dynamics and bully the local obstetrician into performing a fake sonogram for Will to attend. “I’ve been a really crummy wife lately,” says Terri. O RLY? Sue and Schue eventually shout it out, and Will tears her apart: “You have no class. … You spend every waking moment of your life figuring out ways to terrify children to make yourself feel better about yourself and the fact that you’re probably going to spend the rest of your life alone.” Sue steps down as glee co-chair (although she chooses to retain consigliere privileges), and then confronts Quinn about her pregnancy. Rachel had been keeping Jacob quiet with panty payments, but once he let the news slip to Sue, the coach forces him to publish on his blog. With her popularity threatened, and with possibly nothing left but glee, Quinn is distraught, and the club rallies around her in the final number.
Musical Numbers
“Hate on Me” by Jill Scott
This forgettable number lacks a center. We realize the scene is supposed to be a first-run, justifying the visual aimlessness, but the song’s emotional footing is uncertain as well. The performance is happy without capturing a sense of empowerment. It’s just flat, and we know Amber Riley can sing, so we’re not sure what went wrong. The choreography somewhat comes together halfway through – FlyBy enjoyed Mercedes walking along on those chairs – but what in the world did they have Kurt doing?
C
“Ride wit Me” by Nelly feat. City Spud
YES. This attempts the same serendipitous, organic feel, but gets it right. The choreographed scene looks unplanned, or at least believable, and that’s a hard task, as Expressions learned this week. The enthusiasm in the nostalgic jam session makes glee look like the funnest class ever, proving the show isn’t just production values smoke-and-mirrors. Our only caveat: it’s a little problematic that the two modern, “black” pieces in this diversity episode weren’t actual performances. We got an unplanned rehearsal and a jam sesh vs. major production numbers. Awks.
A for effort
“No Air” by Jordin Sparks with Chris Brown
Thanks to Will’s orders to practice even “between classes” we’re treated to a hilarious school-hallway-as-music-video-wind-tunnel situation, and we completely approve. Rachel’s great here, and Quinn’s seething is perfect, but Finn’s heavily autotuned voice is distracting. Still it's an enjoyable number. However, FlyBy is vehemently opposed to anything that sanctions the continued career of the monster that is Chris Brown.
F
“You Keep Me Hangin’ On” by The Supremes
This furious and sexually frustrated dream sequence comes straight out of nowhere, and it’s powerful. The mixing on Quinn’s voice is a little weak, but otherwise her performance is tough as she punches her way through the number. Throw in some Cheerios in football uniforms as backup and we have the episode’s showstopper.
A-
“Keep Holding On” by Avril Lavigne
The previews made us think this song was in response to something happening with Quinn’s baby. We think it’s a bit much given the situation. Also, Avril? Really? Luckily, while the mangled syllables are still there, the arrangement is a big improvement. Dubbing an Avril echo onto an Avril voice track doesn’t do much for us, but having the chorus of guys echo the girls wrests emotions from the song that were absent in the original. The choreography melds all the cliques well, but that last bit of hand-holding… what did that even mean?
B+/A-
Missing Plotlines
Sue’s Corner
Setting Sue, “mighty Greek warrior,” to Carmina Burana was brilliant. We hope someone got promoted. Also fun: a double-headed coin, threats of vomit, an ability to smell failure, and an increasingly improbable biography. We are now to believe she is a Comanche and a former VJ. Sue’s idea of “empowerment” is “irrational, random terror,” and she finds “psychosexual derangement” to be “fascinating.”
This week’s best lines
Roll call of minorities: “Santana. Wheels. Gay kid. ... Asian. Other Asian. Aretha. And Shaft.”
Advice to Harvard students?: “If they want to be bankers, and lawyers, and captains of industry, the most important lesson they could possibly learn is how to do a round off.”
On puns: “That is a lawsuit, mister! I will Sue your ass!”
On Brittany’s heritage: “Oh, I know the Dutch are famous for being a cold people, but that’s no excuse for [Will] treating you like some half-priced hooker in Amsterdam’s famous red-light district.”
On inclusion: “Sue Sylvester’s rainbow tent will gladly protect you from [Will’s] storm of racism.”
The Short Version
So many different stories came to a head this week! FlyBy loved all the confrontations. We enjoyed the “empowerment” theme, too, but we’re unsure about the show’s handling of minorities. This has been a problem from the beginning: Kurt’s coming out, for example, was handled with surprising respect. But are we to read Mr. Ryerson as a villainous pedophile or as an offensive gay stereotype? “Throwdown” addresses these issues with mixed results, succeeding in being considerate yet funny, but failing to deepen the most stereotyped characters. We like that Mercedes’ dad is a dentist, but having her announce “I may be a strong, proud black woman but I’m a lot more than that” does nothing in actuality to flesh the character out. Regardless of communities or boundaries, though, surely we can agree that Drizzle is a terrible baby name?
Overall: A-. Attempts to work out portrayals of minorities. Plenty of Sue. Plenty of drama. Plenty of music.
