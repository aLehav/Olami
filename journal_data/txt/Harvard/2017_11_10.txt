After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

David Leo Rice ’10 is a writer, animator, and screenwriter whose body of work spans the genres of horror, noir, sci-fi and the surreal. Since completing his special concentration in “Esoteric Studies: Mysticism and Modernism in Western Thought,” Rice has produced numerous short stories, essays, and animations. Volume I of his serialized novel “A Room in Dodge City,” which follows a nameless wanderer into a bizarre American town, won the 2016 Electric Book award. He is currently finishing up the publication of its second volume. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Rice to discuss his concentration in occultism, favorite reads, and his upcoming publication.
The Harvard Crimson: What have been the most formative reads for you as a writer and a person?
David Leo Rice: Number one on the list would be “The Street of Crocodiles” by Bruno Schulz, a Polish-Jewish writer of the 20th century who wrote extremely surreal and fantastic stories about more or less his hometown—but in a very mythic way. He turns his hometown into a mythic place and that really spoke to me. Some usual suspects like David Lynch, Faulkner, Murakami, Beckett. And I’m really into Japanese literature: Murakami, Mishima, Kobo Abe. Flannery O’Connor, who wrote powerful American Southern stories. And I’ll tell you one last person. There’s Clarice Lispector, who’s a Brazilian writer who I like a lot.
THC: You seem to draw from literature all around the world. At what point did you start branching beyond the classics of the Western canon?
DLR: We had these family friends in Italy so I grew up reading and speaking Italian. So, things like Calvino were very important to me as a kid. I think Calvino is a world literature figure, and he is interesting because he both collected actual Italian fairy tales—he was like the Grimm brothers of Italy—and wrote his own original fiction. That idea was really important to me: You could participate in folklore. That you could be involved in actual fairy tales and folktales and write your own work [and there] was not a clear line between the two. 
THC: What did you study during your time at Harvard College, and why did you choose your own special concentration?
DLR: My concentration was “Esoteric Studies: Mysticism and Modernism in Western Thought.”... The basic idea was to combine medieval texts, religious styles, and mythic styles … with what you could call modernist literature. So early 20th century stuff, like Beckett, Joyce, Walt, and American authors, Faulkner and García Márquez.
I think I was interested in a new irrationality. My hypothesis was that in the 20th century some sort of demonic or feverish type of medieval thought was coming back through a kind of craziness, was taking over the world.
THC: Volume III of “A Room in Dodge City” reads as a fictionalized, surreal report on the 2016 election with reference to Donald Trump as the p**** grabber. It also reads as both a blog and novel. What drew you to publishing your first novel in online installments, and do you see your writing as having an inherently political function?
DLR: Any kind of horrifying political moment is [a] narrative in some way. The way dictators come to power is always by playing on some kind of a myth and some kind of a scary story that exists in people’s subconscious. I think for me it felt like a really occult moment. The emergence of this sort of monster—who in “Dodge City” is literally a monster, a creature who comes out of the swamp—is almost like the return of the medieval demon puncturing the placid, modern world of Obama. For selfless reasons I wanted to contribute to something like protest literature. And for more selfish reasons I was just genuinely interested in what is the dramatic potential of this whole situation.
THC: Where do you stand on the issue of genre concerning your own writing?
DLR: I feel like over the past few years, I have increasingly moved away from the world of horror. I think I always meant something different [by horror] than what people understood. ... I would like to say I just don’t care about genre, but I do think it is important to give people the feeling they can get into something. You do have to offer something like a handle for people to take. There’s a world of what’s called “weird fiction,” and I would be happy to use that word, that would be fine. Something that I’m really interested in—I don’t know if it counts as a genre—is American surrealism.
THC: What are you working on right now and can you give any sneak previews?
DLR: The first volume of “A Room in Dodge City” is out. I have just sent the second one to the publisher, and the third one is [about a] Trumpian genocide which is also a kind of criticism of the media about how these different news feeds begin to contradict one another. “Angel House” is done but just sort of sitting there.
The main thing I’m working on now is a separate but related short novel called “The Emergency Hotel,” which is about a washed-up comedian who gets stuck in a Holiday Inn in Montana just as there’s a huge, huge mass shooting. And it’s kind of like Groundhog Day in that he’s just stuck in this Holiday Inn, and the mass shooting happens every night, and it keeps happening in the mall attached to this Holiday Inn. The police who seem like they’re trying to solve it keep torturing a puppet to get him to confess… and things just go more and more haywire.

Agustin A. Rodriguez Lopez ’18 sits slumped, hands and feet dangling from the chair in the middle of the SOCH penthouse. He will play Frank Steins, a man with severe physical impairments, in the upcoming production by the same name presented by Harvard College TEATRO! For writer and director Brandon Martinez ’20, “Frank Steins” is a particularly meaningful piece. Not only does his forthcoming play aim to diversify Harvard’s theater scene, but it also aspires to accurately represent those struggling with physical disabilities.
With “Frank Steins,” Martinez will debut as a theater director on campus. He brings to the table personally significant subject matter: In what would become inspiration for his script, Martinez worked in a camp for individuals with disabilities. “People not only cared for one another but embraced who they were,” said Martinez. Deeply touched by his experience and newly committed to bringing people together around physical and mental healing, the director hopes to help the disabled to accept themselves but also to highlight that the physically impaired think and feel no different from everyone else.
Martinez presents a novel approach to doing so: Frank Steins’ physical and mental presences on stage are distinct, played by two different actors. While Rodriguez depicts the physical actions and reactions of Steins as he interacts with the world around him, Janiah Lockett ’20 portrays his mind. Especially important is Lockett depiction of Steins’ mind as one that everyone can identify with: indecisive, over-thinking, and sporadic.
The production also took meticulous care in factually portraying a patient with muscular dystrophy, as physically able bodied actors playing disabled people could be problematic. Martinez brought in a choreographer to work with Rodriguez on his posture and mannerisms. “Every movement I do becomes very, very deliberate and very purposeful,” said Rodriguez.
While the theater world as a whole is making strides toward increased diversity of race and sexuality, the disabled community has continued to be considerably underrepresented. When addressing the intent of “Frank Steins,” producer Mason Sands ’20 said, “Seeing how it supports the overall goal of diversity in theater is what drew me to the project.”
“Frank Steins” will run in the Loeb Experimental Theater from Nov. 9 until Nov. 12.

Having won a Grammy for his Netflix special “Talking for Clapping,” comedian Patton Oswalt has returned with a new hour-long special, “Annihilation.” A reaction to the past two years, the show discusses both the country we live in and the tragic death of Oswalt’s wife. More than simply entertainment, humor in “Annihilation” reflects on and dissects our current state of affairs. Didactic but not quite preachy, Oswalt’s special intertwines humor and reflection in order to make sense of the unpredictable world around him.
Pulling no punches, Oswalt begins by addressing the tumultuous American political situation. Arguing that, contrary to popular belief, the current administration is tiring out comedians rather than providing them free material, the comedian laments rather than capitalizes on the nation’s division. Oswalt’s jokes are provocative but lighthearted, likening the threat of nuclear war to a reenactment of the television show M.A.S.H. and connecting failed New Year’s resolutions with the presidential inauguration in January. Beyond just targeting those in power, however, he also pokes fun at the electorate’s political apathy and swing away from progressivism. Oswalt uses these bits to frame his larger message rather than allow them to stand as the crux of his show. This era of social and political upheaval serves as the backdrop for the personal turmoil Oswalt has recently experienced.
The centerpiece of his special is a heartbreaking look back at the tragic death of his wife last year. Oswalt describes a sort of compounded chaos, layering personal tragedy on top of political division. It’s a stark but effective shift in tone, marking the emotional climax of his routine. His jokes get less frequent and more pointed. Some shine spotlight on the illogic around us, while others, including one absurdist anecdote about a family standing in a graveyard singing along to a bass-less rendition of Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On,” act as a much-needed reprieve from the grief he feels. Some of the most salient moments of his stand-up occur when the comic is quietly recounting difficult experiences in his life. Oswalt posits that the only way to remain sane in an absurd world is to take it at face value, both recognizing the absurdity and continuing to live despite it.
Oswalt is funny, but his stage presence isn’t overbearing. He paces mildly, gesticulates sporadically, and tries his hand at imitation only occasionally. Though the delivery of his lines is fair, his comedic content rather than stage presence is what makes the show.
That is not to say that there aren’t moments which fall flat. Many of Oswalt’s jokes, based on stories, tend to get long-winded, and some of them provide little payoff at the end. His attempts to engage the audience are hit-or-miss. The improvised crowd work is a bit out of place in Oswalt’s otherwise very deliberately structured show. Transitions between disparate topics tend to get a little patchy at times. For all the work the comedian puts into his message, you’d expect the execution to be smoother than it often is.
That said, Oswalt papers over these weaker moments by pushing the theme of destruction throughout his special. Though it’s a motif which only becomes fully fleshed out in retrospect, it doesn’t feel out of place. Perhaps the structure of his show is deliberately entropic, a chaotic collection of comical moments loosely joined by Oswalt’s larger didactic purpose. The comedian offers his audience a way to combat the destructive forces constantly present in the world by sharing a line of advice from his late wife: “It’s chaos. It’s all random. And it’s horrifying. And if you want to try to reduce the horror and reduce the chaos, be kind, that’s all you can do. It’s chaos. Be kind.”
And so, as the camera leaves the applauding comedy club and pans out across the late-night cityscape, we are left not laughing, but thinking. Oswalt’s “Annihilation” identifies some of the least savory but most real aspects of adult life and uses humor to wrangle with them head-on. The honesty with which he presents his own experiences make his otherwise trite advice more palatable: Oswalt comes off less as self-help guru on a soapbox and more as an individual genuinely trying to reason through an unfair world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If this year’s nominees for drama series are the pinnacle of television, I find myself terrified at the prospect of watching anything else on the small screen. Two—“Westworld” and the eventual winner, “The Handmaid’s Tale”—are paeans to squandered potential. Both are thoroughly good shows that could have, should have, and, under a defter touch, would have been truly fantastic. Two—“The Crown” and “Better Call Saul”—feel formulaically good, as if their respective show runners blithely applied some of the ideas behind Golden Age television but have little of their predecessors’ souls. “This Is Us” is emotional manipulation that belongs in the daytime slot next to soap opera reruns. “House of Cards” is shamelessly bad. “Stranger Things,” seems to unfortunately fetishize an unearned sense of ’80s nostalgia—although it is still a competent and occasionally compelling vehicle for exploring the wonder of childhood.
However, perhaps this should not be framed as a single-year decline in the quality of dramatic television. After all, Seasons Five and Six of “Game of Thrones”—hardly the show’s best work, and for that matter, hopefully not television’s best work—were the winners in this category in the last two years. Instead, this year’s winners and nominees are emblematic of some long-term trends in premium television: The best shows in drama are becoming more formulaic and less internally ambitious; the best shows in television are shifting towards short-form formats and comic genres.
Briefly, this year’s winner, “The Handmaid’s Tale,” exemplifies some of these unfortunate shifts in prestige television. It is helmed by a generally fantastic Elisabeth Moss—I genuinely wonder if she has ever turned in a bad performance—and a particularly good supporting cast, with the noted exception of Yvonne Strahovski, who gives a masterclass on overacting. The premise is particularly sharp. It depicts a dystopian America in which the government has been overthrown by Christian fundamentalists who eliminate most social, legal, and economic rights for women. In other news, infertility is rampant. Women who can bear children are forced to become “handmaids”—individuals who are legally forced to copulate with men married to women who are unable to bear children. Offred (Moss) is one of those handmaids.
However, despite the ambition of the premise—and the deep sense of dystopia that intellectually drives the show—“The Handmaid’s Tale” seems unwilling to engage fully with the overt horror of the world it has constructed. The world constructed, of course, is terrifying. Yet a sense of benevolence seems to protect its central characters. Each bad decision seems validated by the lack of appropriate response from the seemingly all-knowing totalitarian regime. Each tactical mistake in rebellion is rationalized through an improper reaction. It is Big Brother in name, not practice.
The show has, if I may be forgiven for being cold-hearted, too much love for its characters. “The Handmaid’s Tale” is marked by an ability to recognize the brutality of totalitarianism when it comes to nameless faces, and a relative inability to truly allow that brutality to affect its primary characters. If the Republic of Gilead (formerly the United States) were truly as repressive and dystopian as the premise implies, Offred and several of the other main characters, would have been tried, hung, and buried by midseason. (Stalin would say by the second episode.)
Yet perhaps this should not be viewed as an independent problem with “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Serialized television maintains its audience by creating consistency in form and content—consistency antithetical to the cruel randomness of real life. Moreover, if we are to say one thing about television, it can often serve as escapism from reality—a certain random reality that “The Handmaid’s Tale” lacks.
So perhaps Moss’s drama serves as a certain halfway point between ambitious art and the formulaic. It is ambitious in its premise and well-acted (similar to other prestige shows), yet the sitcom-like sense that “everything will be all right” seems to prevail. The same could be said about the winner of the last two Emmys, “Game of Thrones,” in its later seasons.
Perhaps the problems of “The Handmaid’s Tale” explains some of the major shifts in the distribution of quality television. As shows become more consumed with maintaining week-to-week emotional consistency across several seasons, the shows with the most creative freedom are those that are limited to a one-season run—where the randomness of life and death is not restricted by the emotional demands of a yearly audience.
Outstanding Limited Series: ‘Big Little Lies’ and Outstanding Limited Series: ‘San Junipero’
As detailed in our season-long episode recaps of “Big Little Lies,” the show is a fascinating depiction of physical and emotional abuse, a subtle depiction of womanhood, and a case study in acting. Nicole Kidman is spellbinding. As is Alexander Skarsgård. Even Reese Witherspoon and Shailene Woodley are impressive—it is Woodley’s first truly compelling performance since the 2011 film, “The Descendants.” A similar level of praise can be lavished on “Fargo” and “The Night Of,” two richly compelling series that, quite frankly, are in another league of television compared to the nominees for Outstanding Drama Series.
It is not just that each of these series is able to create a cohesive series of episodes by limiting the scope of their respective stories to one season—although much of the wonder derived from all three limited series is seeing a narrative as it is stretched out to the longer length of television programs while simultaneously maintaining a sense of narrative unity. In “Big Little Lies” the narrative conceit is the investigation into an individual’s death that carries on throughout the season. By no means is it the best part of “Big Little Lies”—but it does provide a certain sense of narrative circularity, a certain sense that the creators had premeditatively fashioned the world of the series—a certain sense of artistic wholeness that is difficult to produce with an open-ended series (such as “The Handmaid’s Tale”).
Perhaps because these series are self-contained, they are able to be a bit more ambitious in the way that they treat their characters in the world that they craft for them. There is no demand for a year-to-year audience and thus, the shows are able to be a bit more cruel—a bit more realistic—to their characters. And perhaps a depiction of abuse requires exactly that—an embodiment of the cruel hopelessness that an abuser attempts to instill in the abused.
The same cannot be said for “Black Mirror: San Junipero” (Outstanding Television Movie). There is a certain disunity between the ethos of the premise—the consciousnesses of the elderly are uploaded into an ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s party-world that serves as a transitory afterlife—and the world actually artistically depicted on screen. There is a certain glib treatment of potent themes. The relationship between the individual and the afterlife is bizarrely understood—for an episode defined by a philosophy of unrelenting positivity, the nostalgic party-world crafted paints a rather dystopian picture of human demands for the afterlife. (This would be fine if the episode had seriously explored some of these auxiliary themes.) There is no treatment of the meaning of aging and the mental effects of physical paralysis. Most problematically, “San Junipero” peddles in the ever-present television trope that every woman is secretly charismatic and secretly loves to dance. She just need to find the right person to bring it out of her!
With that said, “San Junipero” is the best of the nominated bunch.
The television movie is restricted by many of the limitations of form in a movie—most obviously a quicker runtime—while not having many of the luxuries that big screen films are afforded (a budget and time). “San Junipero,” for example, was filmed over a three-week period. Moreover, they lose some of the impressive wonder of a cohesive miniseries structure—there are no disparate episodes to mold into a coherent whole.
Programs such as “San Junipero” are placed in an uncomfortable position. They are neither able to fully capture the beauty of film or the longform intrigue of television. That is not to condemn the episode model of “Black Mirror” (“San Junipero” is one self-contained episode in its anthology structure, in which each episode takes place in a new world with different characters) but it is to note that is it difficult to produce consistently good television in a television-movie format. The show as a whole is occasionally truly brilliant (“The National Anthem,” “Be Right Back,” “White Christmas,” and occasionally, “Fifteen Million Merits”). But it is, without a doubt, inconsistent.
Outstanding Comedy Series: ‘Veep’
If anything, this year’s comedy nominees are defined by a lack of recognition of some of the more ambitious comedy series on television. HBO’s “Girls” quietly produced one of the best seasons of television across all genres. “Better Things,” “Insecure,” and “The Good Place” are all subtly wonderful shows. But with that said, this year’s nominees are by in large both ambitious and well done (the exception being “Modern Family”). Their quality, by in large, outstrips their more serious counterparts.
This year’s winner is, as it has always been, absolutely fantastic. The 2017 Emmys were marked by a shift in gender representation in the winning shows—each winning show from the three major categories—Comedy, Drama, and Limited Series—were, among other things, fascinating explorations of femininity helmed by female leads. Within this context, “Veep” still manages to stand out—it is a show that is rarely explicitly about gender, and yet always, in every moment, is implicitly about the politics of gender.
Every component of Selina Meyer—the Senator turned Vice President turned President turned Ex-President—is carefully crafted with an eye towards the public’s eye. The essence of her personality is crafted by the Frankensteinian demands of the public. Some of those demands are reflective of what the public expects from women. Thus Selena becomes, in her carefully woven fabric of narcissism, incompetence, and vanity, the embodiment of the pain of societal expectation. She physically embodies and carries the weight of the bundle of contradictions that the American public places on women—especially women in public office. But “Veep” never needs to make its point explicitly; its commentary is deeply incisive because it is implicitly embedded into the nature of the show. It subconsciously works to show the sins of America—to laugh at Ex-President Meyer is to laugh at the delicate relationship America has with gender.
Yet I would be hesitant to indicate that this is part of a large paradigm shift in representation on television. An examination of the nominees indicates a decidedly male slant in television. If the nominated “Silicon Valley” has anything to say about gender—like its real-world counterpart—I shudder to think what it would be. The same must be said, unfortunately, of “Master of None,” occasionally a laughably un-self-aware portrayal of creepy misogyny.
Perhaps it is unfair to pigeonhole this year’s nominees and winners for Outstanding Comedy Series into a narrative about representation. With that said, and if I am allowed to play the reductionist for a moment, the relative success of comedy compared to drama on television in 2017 seems due to two main factors. First, in comedies, cruelty is not expected but it is largely present. Second, cruelty can be transformed into more than a fact of the world due to the baseline of expectation placed onto comedies. Note that these axioms should not be applied to all comedies and dramas with reckless aplomb—they are derived from an examination of the best that comedy and drama currently has to offer on the small screen. The best comedies, particularly this year's nominated bunch, are willing to delve into the depths of the dramatic and the cruel.
Those cruel aspects of modern comedies—Ex-President Meyer’s fall from grace, for example—become in and of themselves radical interventions on the nature of genre, radical because they transcend the line between comedy and drama. The expectation for comedies is imbedded within its name. Every act of cruelty seems to transgress the comedic boundary. Yet, unlike dramas—or more specifically, dramas that take themselves deathly seriously—comedies are able to refashion the cruel into laughter, to modulate the depths of human baseness into a multivariate exploration of the nature of humanity.
In short, it is a problem of expectation—comedies are able to utilize cruelty effectively because the expectation of a comedy is comedy (that expectation inherently refashions what is inherently horrid: cruelty). Dramas must work harder to produce a distinct sense that the cruelty produced onscreen is more than network-sanctioned voyeurism of cruelty. “The Handmaid’s Tale” not only lacks the cruelty that would make it consistent with its fictional world—its genre is inherently limited in its ability to fully capitalize on and actualize the artistic effect of cruelty. And, most sinful of all, it takes itself deathly seriously.
Perhaps the future of television is a welding of the best features of genre and form: the limited series comedy. But, in an act of unintentional parody, I have droned on for the length of the Emmys award show. I can only hope that my words are not as self-congratulatory as theirs.

Leo Tolstoy’s classic 1897 polemic “What Is Art?” may be a surprising first reading for a neuroscience class, but surprises like this are par for the course in MBB 980N: “Neuroaesthetics.” Taught by Nancy L. Etcoff, Assistant Clinical Professor in Psychology at Harvard Medical School, the class investigates the possibilities of applying the science of the brain to the study of art. Neuroaesthetics as a discipline is a very new field of research, only recently gaining momentum in both the artistic and scientific communities. Some are none too happy with this development, and this burgeoning area of study is already under fire.

Etcoff, however, sees great untapped potential in bringing different disciplines into conversation. Her class is a prime example of interdisciplinarity, attracting students from a range of departments and schools, including Neurobiology, History of Art and Architecture, Psychology, English, and the Graduate School of Design.

Theodora T. Mautz ’19, a Neurobiology concentrator, echoed Etcoff on the value of crossing disciplines. “It’s a really cool merging of many interests of mine—neuroscience, art, social interaction. We are learning about the neural mechanisms behind the appreciation of art. It makes you think about art from a more biological and evolutionary standpoint,” she said.
“The class is extremely interesting—conversations go in new, novel directions that challenge everyone’s way of thinking,” said Harrison D. Phelps ’19, a Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator in the class. “Professor Etcoff also allows students to lead many of the discussions, allowing for more freedom and exploration.”
Although she made her name as a scientist, Etcoff has firm roots in the arts and humanities. She started off in college studying comparative literature and dreamed of becoming a novelist. She soon switched her major to psychology because she found that it was addressing many of the same questions she was asking in literature about emotions and motivations.
Aesthetics is a topic traditionally claimed by the humanities, especially by philosophy and art history. “It’s just one of those questions that science has shied away from, because it didn’t seem answerable or even definable,” Etcoff said. But with the innovations of technology in recent decades, such as fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), that can give a concrete picture of what is going on in the brain, scientists are increasingly able to peer into realms of the human experience that were once thought to be totally abstract and intangible.
“The question of beauty is something that science has shied away from,” Etcoff said. “It didn’t seem answerable or definable. Happiness is another one. There are a lot of books on negative emotions like disgust, fear, anger.” But Etcoff is interested in expanding the scope of science to the pleasures in life, like the appreciation of art and beauty, and positive emotions like happiness, calm, gratitude, awe, relief. As the director of the Program in Aesthetics and Well-Being at Massachusetts General Hospital, she is working to create more beautiful hospital spaces to aid patients in recovery.  She also teaches the science of happiness in a freshman seminar.
She is currently studying how flowers may decrease stress levels and improve focus and attention—and they do. Why? Etcoff uses evolutionary theory to explain. “We know that although flowers have little practical use, they have powerful effects on people’s behavior and feelings,” Etcoff said. “People give flowers for forgiveness, at funerals, to celebrate. They provide solace, joy, forgiveness, compassion. Looking back on evolution, flowers might have signalled that the environment was positive for human habitation. And so it makes sense that they lower stress levels.”
“Beauty is one of life’s basic pleasures,” Etcoff said. “We want to keep near us, feel more sympathy and compassion for, and are elevated and enriched by what is beautiful.”
Art is particularly fascinating to Etcoff because the emotions it arouses in people are so complicated. “Back when I was in graduate school,” Etcoff said, “we would look at emotions as moving along axes from positive to negative, with a clear distinction between the two. But people often say they are ‘moved’ by art. People often enjoy, for example, a sad movie. Why would people ever voluntarily seek out sadness?”
Etcoff says it has to do with the activation of two systems in the brain that are normally separate. This simultaneous activation happens when people feel “moved” by art. While the person’s focus is directed at a specific external stimulus (the artwork), the default mode network, which is normally active when attention is not directed at a stimulus, and consists of “mind wandering” and involves thoughts about the self, memory, and future, is also activated. In other words, art arouses an extremely complex whole-brain response that brings into play many usually disparate aspects of the mind.
“It may explain why those feelings are difficult to articulate and yet are so profound,” Etcoff said.

Semir Zeki, Professor of Neuroaesthetics at University College London, a pioneer in the field. With the help of neuroimaging technology, he has discovered that there is an area of the brain called the medial orbital frontal cortex that always “lights up,” or correlates with the perception of beauty, whether it is in response to visual, musical, mathematical, or even moral beauty. Although each type of experience activates different combinations of areas in the brain, the overlap always occurs in the medial orbital frontal cortex.
“Philosophers have always spoken of beauty in the abstract,” Zeki said. “Clive Bell, an English art critic, once said, ‘If you can tell me everything that aesthetic experiences have in common you will have answered the question of aesthetics.’ No art historian or critic or philosopher has been able to solve this problem, but we have in a limited biological context, namely that we know that aesthetic experience correlates with activity in medial orbital frontal cortex regardless of its source.”

Can the experience of beauty finally be quantified?
“The answer is yes—activity in the medial prefrontal cortex is stronger when you think something is more beautiful,” said Zeki.
But what about the subjectivity of art appreciation? Don’t some people find things beautiful that others find ugly?
Zeki is well aware of the fact that people often find more beauty in an artwork the more they are exposed to it. For this reason, he rarely studies the brains of accomplished artists themselves. “When you talk and write and study art, you must not ever discuss it with artists or musicians or historians of art or philosophers because they know too much,” Zeki said. “We are studying it at a simple elemental level—ordinary person’s perceptions. I’m interested in basic function and organization of the brain.”
He divides the perception of beauty into biologically and culturally inherited. “Now you take a beautiful woman from Japan. The chances are high that she will be very beautiful in England. And people of all cultures find young babies very beautiful. A Muslim may think a mosque is more beautiful than a Catholic cathedral because it has accrued more meaning for him, but that’s a culturally inherited trait, not biologically. But a beautiful woman is beautiful wherever you go.”
Most of the opposition to Zeki’s pioneering efforts have been from art historians and philosophers, rather than from practicing artists. “Artists are in a sense neuroscientists who are exploring common questions,” Zeki said. He believes art theorists simply feel threatened by this new information that will shake up their traditional ways of thinking about aesthetics. “You will never have a complete theory of aesthetics unless you take account of the organ through which you have the aesthetic experience,” Zeki said.

To illustrate just how recently neuroaesthetics has gained traction as a serious field of inquiry, consider Ina Kodra ’18: as a sophomore, Kodra attempted to declare a special concentration in neuroaesthetics, but her request was denied. At the time, such a plan of study included too many disparate elements to be properly called a concentration. Now, just a few years later, students like Kodra are welcome to push the boundaries between art and science.
Although neuroaesthetics is taking off in the scientific community, it has had a harder time making inroads into the world of art. One major exception to this trend is Tedi E. Asher, the neuroscientist in residence at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, MA. Her two-year position is funded by a grant from the Barr Foundation, a Boston-based nonprofit that supports research into a variety of fields, including the arts.
“The main goal of the neuroscience initiative at PEM is basically to enhance visitor engagement,” Asher said. “So, to create experiences within the galleries that are more meaningful to our visitors, and engage them more fully in taking in the artwork.” Six months into her new role, Asher said it is too early to say that she’s made any discoveries yet, but she has been working on finding ways to apply existing neuroscience literature to the museum environment.
One concept Asher has been exploring is the notion of salience. As she explained it, “When an element in a scene or in an image stands out from the background—so it could be a different color, it could be a different shape, it could be moving in a different direction than the rest of the scene—those elements are said to have salience.” Building on that idea, Asher is working on creating “saliency maps,” which illustrate the parts of an image most likely to draw attention. By understanding how visitors to the museum actually look at art, Asher hopes to make the pieces in PEM easier to navigate and appreciate.
Although PEM is the first museum to hire a neuroscientist in residence, other institutions have explored the artistic potential of scientific research. The Tate Britain, a museum in London, presented an exhibition in 2015 called the Tate Sensorium. Recognizing that sight is only one of the senses, the museum paired four paintings from its collection with a variety of tastes, smells, sounds, and haptic sensations. As part of the exhibit, visitors wore specialized wristbands to measure their perspiration, used as an indication of their excitement. In this way, the Tate attempted to use the latest in scientific and technological research to aid in the appreciation of art and to measure its effect.
Museums and galleries like the Tate and PEM may among the first to incorporate the findings of neuroscience into their exhibitions, but they are almost certainly not the last. As neuroaesthetics takes off, and more attention and research is devoted to it, the line between art and science may become increasingly blurred. Although Zeki and Etcoff may see this as a positive development, not all are quite so rosy about this prospect.

Having discussed neuroscience, and neuroaesthetics in particular, in the New York Times, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and on NPR, R. Alva Noë is one of the most vocal critics of those fields. Noë received a PhD at Harvard in 1995 and is now a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. He warns against seeking to combine these seemingly separate areas of thought without careful consideration. First, however, he wants to make one thing clear: “I am pro-neuroscience.” For Noë, any attempt to achieve greater understanding of ourselves is beneficial. However, he pointed out, “I think we’re a long way from having adequately understood ourselves in neuroscientific terms alone.”
Among Noë’s main concerns, therefore, is to make sure that researchers remain humble about the actual ability of neuroscience to understand the processes that underpin human cognition.  Noë argues that neuroaesthetics takes both too broad and too narrow a view of art and beauty. On the one hand, neuroaestheticians talk about how the structure of the brain determines our range of available aesthetic experiences: for instance, we rely on our color vision to appreciate a painting. “Merely to point out that we need color vision to experience colorful paintings says no more than that we need color vision to see anything,” Noë said. He argues that such a view is too broad to be of use in attempting to define such complex experiences. “That's part of the reason that the aesthetic is a valuable category, precisely that it is undecided, but it's a domain that we talk about,” he said.
On the other hand, Noë feels that art is treated too narrowly, as a kind of neural stimulus. In this view, art “triggers an effect in us, and that effect in us is the aesthetic experience, so then you can ask, ‘Well, what happens in the brain when you have this aesthetic experience?’” In Noë’s mind, this is the wrong, or at least a less interesting approach. Instead, he prefers “to think of aesthetic experiences as better thought of as engagement on our part with the opportunities thrown up by a work of art.” For Noë, what we bring to a piece of art is as important as what the art gives to us.
Noë is not alone in his critiques. Even those involved in neuroaesthetics have their doubts about its promise. Despite her efforts to apply her neuroscientific background to the world of art, Asher said, “I think understanding art, or deriving meaning from art is such a holistic experience, I think to try and reduce it down to down to a set of mechanisms might be oversimplifying it.” That being said, of course, she believes the field has the potential to bear fruit. Or, as Noë put it, “I don't want to say no to neuroscience. My concern is that neuroscience says no to art.”

An old saying goes that explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. It’s not very interesting, and the frog dies. Do we have anything to fear from this new and exciting branch of science? Will the application of cold, rational science to the free-flowing world of art end up with art in the position of the proverbial frog? All those involved, on every side, seem to agree that this is nothing to worry about. Advocates like Zeki and Etcoff see neuroaesthetics as a whole new way to look at art, full of unexpected and interesting applications. Noë, for his part, thinks they haven’t come close enough to understanding art to damage it.
Perhaps Asher summed it up best when she said, “Generally I think that the more we can understand about ourselves, the deeper appreciation we’ll be able to have for all experiences.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the semester progresses, most courses develop an unofficial, semi-permanent seating arrangement of sorts, a passive agreement amongst students to minimize chaos. By late September, we find ourselves surrounded by the same set of lecture hall neighbors, carefully stepping over familiar rows of backpacks as we make our way to our seats.
However, about a month ago, a young man breached the seating treaty during one of my Thursday courses. Normally, I wouldn’t have cared; my early arrival to lecture guarantees me my preferred seat. What sets this young man apart isn’t his contempt for the unspoken laws of lecture, but rather how he led me to discover my greatest regret.
I generally consider myself well-disciplined. The Facebook feeds and shopping sprees that adorn the sea of lecture hall laptop screens rarely distract me. I once prided myself in paying attention to even the dullest of lectures; doing so granted me a feeling of superiority over my distracted peers, as if simply facing forward somehow made me a better student.
However, the seat thief does not indulge in your typical lecture hall distractions; instead, he plays a flight simulator version of Google Earth. The simulator itself isn’t all that exciting, and its graphics are subpar at best. Moreover, his virtual piloting skills are atrocious; he has yet to stick a single landing since he claimed the seat to my three o’clock.
Originally, I believed myself to be better than the seat thief. I paid attention in class; he didn’t. I came to class on time; he didn’t. I was a respectful student; he wasn’t. Nevertheless, as October came and went, I found myself increasingly unhappy; the lectures had largely devolved into a series of cheesy business platitudes. Meanwhile, the seat thief smiled away as he crashed his plane time after time, oblivious to the speaker’s worthless anecdotes. And that’s when it hit me: I was the time-wasting fool.
This past semester was supposed to vindicate me. I’ve worked hard over these past three years, believing that my prioritization of academics would soon pay off. Yet, despite my disdain for procrastination, my senior year has proven far less enjoyable than I had imagined. Rather than reward me for my diligence, life has instead smacked me with additional busywork. In my attempts to complete everything on time, my personal life has withered. I now seldom call my girlfriend, and the weekly Skype sessions with my brother have all but ceased. And yet, the pile of documents on my desk continues to grow.
I don’t hate demanding work; nothing grants me greater satisfaction than lying in bed peacefully, knowing that I’ve completed the day’s tasks. Nevertheless, I wrongly assumed that, in exchange for my industrious habits, the lords of life would respect my personal space. But, as the time for those I love has dwindled, I’ve come to question whether all the time I’ve spent studying was worth anything. All the courses I’ve taken—save Russian—have little (if anything) to do with my future. Ironically, Harvard gives me no credit for the one mandatory Army class I must take every semester, the course most pertinent to my military career.
On September 20, I was informed that I would join the Army’s Active Duty service component following Commencement. If all goes well, I’ll report to Ft. Leonard Wood, Mo., for Basic Officer Leader Course sometime this summer. Although I welcomed the news, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of regret as the weeks went by. I had always known that I would join the Army upon graduating; thus, college wasn’t a question of where I was going, but rather what I would do before I got there. And to be frank, I made the wrong choice.
When soldiers ask me what I did in college, I’ll have a boring reply. I spent most of my evenings in libraries with books I doubt anyone reads or cares to read. I spent my afternoons at lectures that people wiser and smarter than myself rarely bothered attending. Moreover, most of my peers, despite their incessant shopping and scrolling, will likely find great financial success in fields far safer than my own. It’s not that I’m jealous; I wholeheartedly wanted (and still want) to make a commitment to military service. I’m simply upset that I bought the perverse lie that plagues prestigious institutions, namely that your grades will somehow reimburse you for your lost time, time that you should’ve spent developing the relationships that matter most.
Last Thursday, the seat thief exited the flight simulator, opting to play online golf instead. I was disappointed; golf is boring in real life, so why would anyone exchange virtual flight for virtual golf? Curious, I opened my computer and searched for the flight simulator. Unfortunately, my laptop died mid-lecture before completing the download.
Later that evening I called my girlfriend, and for the first time in a while, I felt at peace. We talked for an hour, and before I knew it, I had gone to bed without having completed my history readings. When I woke up, I glanced at my agenda and was slightly bothered that I hadn’t checked the box next to “Thursday’s readings.” I crossed off the task and smiled; after three years, I had finally learned to care less.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The use of guns in America has always bewildered me. I remember receiving a two-week leave of absence from the Israeli Defense Forces and visiting relatives in New York. We rented a car and drove all the way to beautiful Maine, where we encountered a gun store. In the store, I saw the same M-16 I was using in military patrols on Israel’s borders. My American relative, a young man who has never seen a gun shot before, could buy an M-16 and leave the store in less than 15 minutes. To me, that situation couldn’t have been more absurd.
In 36 states, there are no legal requirements for gun registration. No permit is needed and no license is necessary to purchase and own a firearm, whether it is a rifle, shotgun, or handgun. Furthermore, in gun shows around the country, one may buy a gun from a private seller even without a rudimentary background check. Nearly 40 percent of gun transactions in the United States are the product of private party sales that are bound to the same rules as those in gun shows. Hence, they require no background check. When I first learned of this, I was dumbstruck. My perception of owning a gun couldn’t be more different.
Almost five years ago, I joined the IDF. That day, I was surrounded by guns for the first time. Before being able to hold one, I went through a fairly extensive background check which included checking my psychological status.
A few days later, with the authorization of the base commander, a colonel with 30 years of service in his record, we received our M-16 assault rifles. The armory is the most secured place in base, guarded 24/7 and open only during daylight hours. After receiving our guns, my teammates and I learned almost everything about our weapons: who made them, the name of every single part, how to handle and clear gun jams, how to assemble and disassemble our weapons, how to clean them properly, and how to load and fire.
I remember spending hours practicing how to shoot. We would yell “Fire!” instead of actually shooting. Eventually, after our commanders approved, we went to the range with live ammunition. However, we were still not allowed to use the automatic stance of our guns (the same stance Stephen Paddock, the shooter from Las Vegas, was able to use thanks to certain modifications).
The training was taxing and hectic, and for every mistake we paid dearly: Staying on base while your friends got to go home was the most common punishment. Weapons safety is disciplined into all soldiers repeatedly throughout their service, starting in boot camp and going all the way to the last time a soldier will use a gun. All of that time and all of those resources are dedicated in order to instill in every soldier a profound understanding of the precarious character of his or her weapon.
There is a huge gulf, then, between my understanding of the gun culture in the IDF and gun culture in many places in the United States.
A few years after I enlisted in the IDF, I became an Army officer. I still remember the stress that involved every day of shooting with my soldiers. Making it back to base with everyone safe and sound was my primary objective. Being so close to such a deadly tool teaches one how dangerous it truly is.
But you don’t need to shoot a gun in order to understand how dangerous it is. There are more than 33,000 annual gun deaths in the U.S. This number is so high that the death toll between 1968 and 2011 by guns alone surpasses the amount of US soldiers killed in all wars from the Civil War to the war in Iraq.
It is clear that we will never be able to prevent every mass shooting that happens in America. Since there are more guns in the United States than there are in any other country, people with malicious intentions, in some cases, will still be able to acquire guns even if gun laws are changed.
Nonetheless, changing the gun culture will have a tremendous effect that will only grow with time. Just as one is required to pass both a written exam and a behind-the-wheel test in order to obtain a driver’s license, so should be the case with obtaining a license to own a far deadlier tool, a gun. Similarly, license renewals that include practices in a range and written exams should be implemented. This will not erase the problem instantly, but it will mitigate it.
Moreover, we can make it harder for criminals, mentally unstable people, and terrorists to own a firearm. Extensive background checks and mental reviews are needed and will make it more difficult for people who are not mentally stable, law-abiding citizens to acquire guns. Toughening the criteria to obtain firearms will make it much more difficult to commit mass shootings and accidents involving a misuse of guns. A terrorist with a knife can do far less damage than one with a rifle, and no kid will play with their parent’s gun if that gun wasn’t around, or, at least, safely stored.
Gun laws need to change. Getting a gun, especially assault rifles, should not be this simple. A good starting point will be to completely prohibit the sale of military grade assault rifles, like those used by Stephen Paddock and Devin Kelley. These guns belong on military bases and behind enemy lines, not on the streets of American towns.

After intense focus on a variety of important local and state elections, the Harvard student body should prepare to shift its focus to the ballot that has an impact even closer to home: the Undergraduate Council ballot. In addition to electing the UC’s next President and Vice President, students at the College will be tasked with taking a stance on the four referenda appearing on the UC ballot.
As we’ve recently opined, the referendum system is a good method of surveying student opinion and giving the UC insight into what issues they should prioritize. For those reasons, students must think critically in contemplating the merits of the four referenda that received the necessary 650 signatures to be voted on.
A number of the referenda touch on issues that have been discussed and debated at the College for some time. For example, the referenda that asks whether administrators should support the establishment of a “physical space” for issues of diversity, belonging, and inclusion seems to refer to the decades long debate on whether Harvard should establish a multicultural center. As we opined in May, such a center is needed, so we hope that students will support this referendum as a step towards its establishment.
In response the announcement that “Harvard time” is ending, there have been murmurs of student discontent. A referendum question seeks to save Harvard time, asking if “the Faculty of Arts and Sciences should preserve the seven-minute grace period between classes.” While we lament the loss of what is ultimately a Harvard tradition, it’s important to realize that the loss of Harvard time is unavoidable with the expansion into Allston. It does not make sense to vote in favor of this referenda which merely rejects the reality of the schedule change.
The referendum that received the most support in getting on the ballot—at 947 signatures—asks “whether the College should extend Thanksgiving break to include the Monday and Tuesday before the holiday.” Though we acknowledge that the UC does not have direct control over academic scheduling, and that implementing a longer Thanksgiving break would come with its own set of logistical and administrative difficulties, we urge students to vote in favor of this referenda.
Many professors already assume that classes will be scarcely attended on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving break, going as far as to operate on two-week cycles for assignments in November. Squeezing those two extra days elsewhere in the semester, likely at the beginning or the end of the semester, would be viable and would offer students a fuller break.
The last referendum asks whether the College should invest in creating more class-wide programming for sophomores and juniors. There is substantial class-wide programming freshman year, with entities such as the First Year Social Committee, and senior year, with the Senior Class Committee and Senior Week. Yet sophomores and juniors do not have programming that makes them feel a sense of camaraderie with their class. To us, this referenda makes sense, but support for class-wide programming is an actionable area where the UC can effect change regardless of the administration’s reaction to the results of the referenda.
More broadly, it’s critically important that students vote on the referenda, and in the election writ large. A higher turnout than we’ve seen in recent elections will provide a more accurate representation of student opinion. Therefore, it is our responsibility as students to be aware of the issues on the ballot this year and to take the time to cast our votes.

In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

Students joined to share positive body images and to promote healthy lifestyles at “Love Your Body Day” in Ticknor Lounge on Thursday evening.
An annual tradition since the the 1970s, the event marked the start of Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach's outreach on campus. The group seeks to support students struggling with mental heath issues, especially eating disorders.
The group now offers a peer-counseling hotline every night from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.
ECHO member Karen Maldonado ’18 said “Love Your Body Day” provides an opportunity for frank discussion about body image.
“We’re here to become a space where people can talk about body image, love their bodies,” she said. “I think that’s an important thing we are trying to emphasize this year.”
Upon walking into Ticknor, students were greeted by food, soft drinks, and ECHO members encouraging them to answer a prompt: “I love my body because...”
ECHO members wore this year’s “Love Your Body Day” t-shirt, which read, “Respect your Body, Accept your Body, Honor your Body, Cherish your Body.”
Representatives from other organizations like the Student Mental Health Liaisons, Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and Food Literacy Project staffed booths circling the lounge.
Skylar-Bree Takyi ’20, an intern at the BGLTQ office, said it was important for her have a range of voices and perspectives represented at the event.
“I think particularly when we talk about body issues there’s this idea that only straight cis-women experience them, and that’s very far from the truth," Takyi said. "Straight cis-men experience them, gay people experience them, trans people. Everyone has issues with their body,and it’s important that we keep that in mind when we’re creating events meant to support people who are going through that."
Over snacks and beverages, ECHO members emphasized that regular eating patterns are an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
“I think it’s really important to show people that there are so many different ways to do that and that food can be a way to celebrate your body as well,” said ECHO co-director Alana Steinberg ‘18, an inactive Crimson editor.
“I think it’s really important to tell people we can celebrate our bodies in different ways so not only do you have to love your body but you can also accept it, cherish it, nurture it, and we have a lot of resources that allow you to do that,” she added.

Laws instituting a waiting period between the purchase and delivery of a gun reduce gun-related homicides by 17 percent and save hundreds of lives every year, according to a recent Harvard Business School study.
The study, conducted by Business School professors Michael Luca and Deepak Malhotra and doctoral student Christopher W. Poliquin, was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October. Poliquin said the study was motivated by a desire to apply empirical methods from economics and business to the gun homicide issue following the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn.
“We kind of thought, ‘Is there something that we can do? Is there something social scientists can say about this phenomenon of gun violence in the United States,’” he said.
The team sought to evaluate which gun control policies had the greatest impact, Poliquin said. The study examined states that did and did not require people to wait several days before purchasing a handguns over a 45 year period—from 1970 to 2014—and compared changes in homicides in states with and without waiting periods.
“So we look within states over time and how deaths are changing in response to waiting periods. And what we find is a pretty substantial drop of 17 percent in gun homicides following enactment of waiting periods,” he said.
The study was funded internally by the Business School, which Poliquin said allowed the researchers to circumvent some of the issues that usually deter research on gun policy.
“Unfortunately, one of the reasons that we don't actually have a lot of research on gun policy is that it’s pretty hard for people in public health schools for example to even get this work funded. And that's because there are certain limitations from the federal government on funding gun policy research,” he said. “One of the nice things about being at a business school is that HBS can actually fund this work. It has sufficient funds to fund research internally.”
The research also examined a smaller window during the 1990s, when the federal government imposed a waiting period on some states.
“It's really the waiting period that is causing the reduction in gun homicides,” Poliquin said.
Poliquin said the paper suggests that waiting period may be effective because it allows for “visceral emotions” such as anger to diffuse.
“Even if it’s a waiting period of just a few days, it gives time for those emotions to pass. And that makes it less likely that they're going to take action in the heat of the moment that they would later regret,” he said.

University President Drew G. Faust will trade the Harvard presidency for a quieter existence on Cape Cod after July 1, she said—but her successor could begin calling the shots months before that.
After the Board of Overseers—Harvard’s second highest governing body—confirmed Faust as president in February 2007, she began running dean searches and making other significant decisions almost immediately, she recalled in an interview Friday.
Faust’s transition into the role was a somewhat unusual; she took the reins from former president Derek C. Bok, who was serving as interim president at the time after Lawrence H. Summers resigned amid controversy.
Ten years later, recalling the specifics of her transition is difficult, she said, but she remembers receiving a detailed letter from Bok and “many notebooks” full of briefings and tips.  The irregular nature of her transition, however, required her to learn about the duties of the presidency on the go.
"I kind of got thrown into the middle of things right away because Derek, he was doing the president as a gesture of generosity to Harvard, and so he just said, ‘Alright these searches are going, you run them now,’” she said.
“Starting in March or late February, I started running searches for deans and attending Corporation meetings, and so my memory of the transition is that I learned much more by sitting in on things and having responsibilities rather than being officially briefed,” she added.
This time around, she will still be in office and available to answer her successor’s queries. It will be up to the person slated to become Harvard’s 29th president to set the parameters of her involvement in the transition, Faust said.
"I think I’ll wait and see what is on the mind of the new president, and then how I can be most helpful. I don’t want to impose on the new president an agenda or a set of materials uninvited, I should say,” she said.
Faust also said that the president-elect’s geographic proximity to Harvard may influence how quickly that person will begin playing an active role in decision-making. By the time her end date rolls around, though, her successor will need to be ready to take the reins of Harvard completely.
"Would I expect the person to start making decisions right away on July 1st? They better!" she said.
After a comfortable transition, Faust said she hopes to retreat to Cape Cod, where she has owned a house since the 1980s. Ensconced among the beaches and gabled roofs of the Cape, she’ll return to the discipline that originally launched her academic career: history.
“I have always wanted to spend a fall on Cape Cod, and so I hope that this will be the one,” she said. “And I have a plan of how to get back into history, and been thinking about how to get out and catch up in my field, and try to learn to be a historian again."

Harvard students reacted with both joy and disappointment to a string of Democratic victories in New Jersey and Virginia after elections on Tuesday.
In New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy ’79 defeated Republican Kim Guadagno in the state's gubernatorial election. Democrats also won the Virginia governor’s race and, as of Thursday, have flipped 15 State House seats in elections that have been called, giving them a potential path to a narrow majority in 2018.
Students supporting Democratic candidates expressed “excitement” and relief at the election outcomes.  Sharon Yang '18, President of the Harvard College Democrats, hoped that Democratic victories on Tuesday represented a larger “grassroots” effort across the country.
“There’s a lot of energy among Democrats and progressives, and I’m really hopeful that the energy will be carried forward… [and] that we’re building a movement that’s outlasting any reactionary ties to Donald Trump alone,” Yang said.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, a member of the Harvard Democrats member, adding that he saw an increase in student involvement in the elections this year.
“I was really excited by the level of energy we saw from people on the campus — not just people who were active and regular members of the Dems, but people who really hadn't come before but were excited about doing something to make a difference,” Freeland said.
Democrats on campus volunteered in multiple campaigns across the country. Yang, an inactive Crimson editor, estimated her organization made 10,000 calls to prospective voters during phone banks.
“It was a pretty large landslide victory, which was really good to see,” phone bank volunteer Alexander S. Koenig ’21 said, “Turning one big seat is something that Democrats are relatively good at, but turning down-ballot elections and local elections is often harder.”
Republican students expressed a variety of views on what contributed to Democratic victories Tuesday.
Kent K. Haeffner ’18, President of the Harvard Republican Club, said he believes these losses partly stemmed from the failure of a Republican-majority Congress to act on recent legislative initiatives, including tax reform and healthcare.
“It’s a little difficult for Republicans to be excited about things, considering that Republican voters turned out very reliably in 2016 to elect a Republican Congress and a Republican President, and yet they’re seeing very little of what they want,” Haeffner said.
Undergraduate Council Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, a Republican Club member who organized with Florida Senator Marco Rubio's presidential campaign, attributed Republican losses to rhetoric from President Donald Trump’s campaign and his departure from traditional conservative ideology.
“These election results show that we can't rely on this kind of vitriolic derision that the President used. We have to be able to point to concrete steps that we're taking,” Khansarinia said.
“For me and for many of us, for a long time we have understood that Trump is poisonous to the brand 0f the conservative movement, because he’s not a Republican conservative,” Khansarinia added. “So when you hand over your party to someone who doesn't have the ideology or beliefs or the values that you do, this is bound to happen.”

While the latest episode in the months-long social policy saga may be over, the show, according to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, is far from done.
In a major victory for administrators, the Faculty voted down a motion intended to counteract the policy at Tuesday’s monthly meeting 130 to 90.  It marks the end of more than year of campaigning by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 to prohibit administrators from penalizing students from joining “lawful” organizations.
But professors will likely take up the issue again in the future as Harvard finalizes its plans for undergraduate social life.
“This is just one phase, one piece of the larger discussion,” he said. “I think we’ll discuss issues around the policy moving forward.”
“I’m glad we finally got to a point where the Faculty voted,” Smith added.
Smith said that future discussion on the social life policy—which starting with the Class of 2021 prohibits students in single-gender final clubs or Greek organizations from holding on-campus leadership positions or receiving recommendation for several postgraduate fellowships—could happen through both formal and informal channels.
A plan for the future will come up at the next meeting of the Faculty Council, the highest governing body of FAS.
“I’m open to taking direction right now from the Faculty to understand which ways would be more productive for the conversation to continue,” he said.
Smith said University President Drew G. Faust will also be involved in further discussions. Faust is currently tasked with choosing to either keep the current penalties or pick from two other options—a outright ban on single gender social organizations, or some other option—presented by a committee tasked with reevaluating the policy.
Smith said Faust has not consulted him about which option to choose, and that he does not know when she will make her decision.
Although the Lewis motion was defeated, Smith said last month that faculty will likely have to approve the final policy when it goes into the student handbook, as is procedure. However, the current policy is not in the handbook.
In an interview, Faust said she didn’t know what needed to go into the handbook and what didn’t. Smith also did not offer a criterion for handbook inclusion.
“This has been of such interest to the Faculty and has such a big impact on the students that something is going to get put in,” Smith said. “But what it is, I couldn’t tell you.”
At the meeting, some Faculty members claimed that the sanctions policy was a form of discipline and therefore under the purview of the Faculty. Smith said that the policy is more complicated than just discipline—legal challenges could also arise.
“There are pressures from the outside world, legal issues and so forth. Certainly as a Faculty member myself I’m not an expert on these legal issues. We need input from the Office of General Counsel,” Smith said. “As much as people would like to say that this is simple and that this is discipline only, nothing I’ve seen would leave me to believe that this is discipline only.”
At their December meeting, faculty will discuss another social policy-related motion, introduced by East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor David L. Howell. The motion moves that the Faculty recognize that basic rights and freedoms may come into conflict with each other at Harvard. Under the Howell motion, in these cases “it is the responsibility of the faculty and administration of Harvard College to establish policies that protect individual freedoms and rights while upholding the educational mission of the College.”
At Tuesday’s meeting, Classics professor Richard F. Thomas charged that Howell’s motion would cede power from the faculty to the administration, but Smith said he rejected this characterization.
“I honestly did not understand that comment given the fact that the proposed motion actually said Faculty and administrators,” he said.
Howell's motion will be eligible for a vote in December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School is expanding its advising and mentoring programs four months after a school task force studying diversity and inclusion released a report calling for more advising opportunities on campus.
One new program establishes advisory relationships between students and the professors leading their reading groups—specialized classes that focus on one particular topic and are not taken for credit. Previously, students received advisers more randomly with no guarantee that their assigned faculty adviser specialized in their area of interest.
John F. Manning ’82, the school’s recently appointed dean, said the Law School changed its policies to foster more organic and effective advising relationships between students and faculty.
"The value added by mentoring and advising is not evenly distributed across the population and the propensity to seek mentoring and advising is not evenly distributed across the population,” Manning said. “Sometimes the people who would benefit most from a great mentor or advisor are not as likely to seek them out.”
Former Law School dean Martha L. Minow commissioned a task force on student engagement in August 2016 after students staged a series of protests calling on the school to acknowledge its ties to slavery and enact more racially-conscious reforms. When the group released its findings in July 2017, it specifically called for improved advising opportunities.
I. Glenn Cohen, a Law School professor who leads student reading groups, said he thinks the new advising program will help connect students with mentors and advisers more likely to share their specific interests and are more capable of answering their questions.
“The reading group topics are connected to areas the students may be interested in, and by having the reading group instructors serve and be advisors for the students, we’d be more likely to get a match between what a particular student’s interest is and what the faculty member’s expertise is,” Cohen said.
Manning said the new program has already had a measurable effect. He said both the number of students participating in reading groups increased, as did the number of professors who signed on to teach these courses.
He added that only 20 students in this year’s first-year class chose not to sign up for reading groups.
Marcia Sells, the Law School’s Dean of Students, said the school also instituted a program for students to take faculty out to dinner with all expenses paid by the school, similar to the College’s Classroom-to-Table program. In addition, administrators created a new peer advising program, she said.
“We said to [the peer advisors], ‘You are a resource to them, plan a time to meet with them and talk—they didn’t have to take them out to lunch—but just to be there as a sounding board,’” Sells said.
Sadie Hillier, a first-year student at the Law School, wrote in an email that she thinks the new faculty advising program is very helpful. She wrote that she thinks she got “lucky” with her reading group and advisor, Law School professor Michael J. Klarman.
“I've been provided with an abundance of mentorship opportunities in the last couple of months, and I have seized onto every single one,” Hillier said.
Referencing her new place at the Law School as a first-year student, Hillier added: “ I need all the help I can get.”
Still, David Sackstein ’14, another first-year student who said he was in Cohen’s reading group, said that he fears some people may not get the resources they need despite the new programs.
“There’s always, always, always going to be students who slip through the cracks,” Sackstein said. “I think the school is doing a very admirable job to identify who needs resources and doing a good job of trying to get those resources to those people, but there’s never going to be a perfect advising program.”

The Harvard Art Museums will receive a “transformative” gift of more than 300 drawings from the Dutch Golden Age, including works by Rembrandt and his students.
Donated by alumnus George S. Abrams ’54, the collection of 330 drawings span two centuries and represent over 125 artists, the museums announced Saturday. The Harvard Art Museums now boast one of the most extensive collections of 17th-century Dutch drawings outside Europe.
“The latest gift from the Abrams family is truly transformative for our museums—indeed, for the entire Boston area, especially as the city strives to become a major destination for the study and presentation of Dutch, Flemish, and Netherlandish art,” Director of the Harvard Museums Martha Tedeschi said in a press release.
The recent contribution follows several other donations from Abrams, who is also the trustee of The Crimson’s trust. In 1999, Abrams and his wife Maida gave 110 Dutch drawings to the museums.
According to Abrams, the Harvard Art Museums was a “logical” place for the drawings.
“The Harvard Art Museums, in particular, has always been the center of teaching and education in old master drawings in the United States,” Abrams said. “My wife and I decided that we were going to put Harvard in a much stronger position on old master drawings.”
In celebration of the donation, the museums hosted a symposium during which numerous experts on 17th-century Dutch drawings spoke about the collection’s importance. The museums also held a dinner in Abrams’s honor, during which he was appointed Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in recognition of his promotion of Dutch art.
Several drawings from Abrams’s collection are currently on display at the Harvard Art Museums, where they will remain available for viewing until January 2018.
Some visitors to the museums said the exhibition was one of the primary reasons for their visit.
“I love the drawings. I think you can see the immediacy of the artist’s work,” said Rafael C. Caruso, a guest investigator at Princeton who described the exhibition as “splendid.”
Caruso said one of his favorite works in the collection was “Three Studies of a Dragonfly.”
“I am very fond of Jacques de Gehyn II,” Caruso said. Gesturing to the drawing, he added, “It transforms natural history into art.”
Abrams said he hoped the drawings will aid scholars in their research by providing them “a chance to have close contact with these works of art.”
“It’s a wonderful way to teach in the field,” Abrams said. “It’s a much more complete experience and a much more exciting experience. And it’s a way to educate the teachers and curators of the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Donna E. Shalala, former Secretary of Health and Human Services under former President Bill Clinton, discussed her experience in healthcare policy in a panel at the Harvard School of Public Health Wednesday afternoon.
Shalala said that the failure of the Clinton Administration to pass healthcare reform was among her regrets as Health and Human Services secretary and drew on her experience attempting reform in the nineties to reflect on the contemporary debate over the Affordable Care Act.
“Even the lesson today about universal healthcare is a lesson,” she said. “You better be careful, because people are for it until they find out how it affects them and their own insurance.”
Shalala also said that crafting healthcare policies require difficult negotiations with the private sector.
“The stakeholders you have to buy off. Powerful stakeholders,” she said. “You have to have some kind of consensus, that this is a particular role for the federal government.”
The panel, a series called “Voices in Leadership,” brings “forerunners in their area of expertise” to discuss their experience, according to its website. Past speakers include former United Nations Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.
After serving as president of the University of Miami 2001 to 2015, Shalala served as the President of the Clinton Foundation from 2015 to 2017 and during Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful bid for the U.S. presidency. Shalala has also served as the President of Hunter College and Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Shalala highlighted the increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, which nearly doubled from 1992-1999, as “the most important” achievement during her time in government.
“Building that bipartisan coalition, which brought on the golden age of biomedical research, was far more significant,” Shalala said. “I actually said to President Clinton ‘this will be your legacy.’”
In an interview following the event, Shalala shared her recipe for success as a political adviser, emphasizing the importance of balancing both personal knowledge and interpersonal connections.
“You cannot underestimate being well-prepared,” she said. “Second of all, you have to get to know people. You can’t just read books, do the statistics, and do policy. You have to understand people’s lives.”
Shalala—who has led three universities in her career, twice as the first woman to hold the position—praised University President Drew G. Faust for a “remarkable tenure” and for “trying to create one University as opposed to a bunch of fiefdoms.” Faust is the first woman to serve as president of Harvard.
Reflecting on her own time as a college administrator, Shalala said that she focused on the student experience.
“I saw the students as the customers. Therefore, I thought universities had to see universities from the view of the students,” she said.  “It wasn’t that I didn’t see faculty as the key, but at the end of the day universities have to focus on what makes students learn best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s basketball team, Friday has been a day marked on its calendar since the start of its offseason program.
On the surface, the team’s first game of the 2017-2018 season against MIT is nothing more than an exhibition. But for a team coming off a devastating loss at the hands of Yale in the inaugural Ivy League tournament, Friday is more than just a showcase game.
Come Friday, the Crimson begins its trek to redemption at Lavietes against MIT. While Harvard’s starting lineup is still anyone’s guess, one thing is for certain: the Crimson’s sophomore class will be at the center of the team’s success.
The class will be spearheaded by sophomore guard Bryce Aiken—in this same matchup a year ago, the rookie finished with a team-high 17 points off the bench. That first game would be telling of the Ivy League Rookie of the Year season that was to come, and as the team begins its season on Friday, the sophomore will no doubt again be at the heart of the Harvard’s offense.
“[Aiken] has worked this summer, and I think he’s been more willing to think about how much more other players are going to have to help for us to reach certain goals, talking to guys through the summer and spring and making sure we’re getting our workouts in,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “It’s not golf or tennis where it just matters what you do, it matters what we do.”
In last year’s matchup against the Engineers, the Crimson’s victory was a largely offensive effort. Harvard finished the game with 78 points, holding the Engineers to 63. MIT was lead by sophomore guard Bradley Jomard, who finished that game with a team-high 14 points and would finish the season averaging over 15. As the Crimson look to Friday’s matchup, containing Jomard will be key to coming away with a win.
Led by Aiken and an athletic wing in sophomore Justin Bassey and forward Seth Towns, Harvard’s offense looks to be just as potent as it was a season prior.
“I’m just thinking with the team that we have that we should have a team that can score with the weapons that we anticipate having,” Amaker said. “They’re playing for us and hopefully they’re playing well. We think that we should be able to score fairly well.”
The Crimson’s real test, however, comes Sunday.
In a season that saw Harvard start the season 1-4, an early loss to UMass was a low point for the Crimson’s squad last year. In that game, Harvard shot only 37 percent from the field and a still developing Aiken went 0-of-9 from the field, earning all six of his points at the stripe.
Come Sunday, the Crimson will be looking to avenge that 66-70 loss in Amherst.
Just as the development and on-court experience of coach Amaker’s sophomores will certainly be a key for Harvard, the same is true for the Minutemen—UMass return a class of five sophomores, with guard Luwane Pipkins coming off an impressive freshman campaign. One crucial loss for the team is Donte Clark, who opted to transfer to Coastal Carolina as a graduate student for his final year of eligibility after previously declaring for the NBA Draft.
All told, the Crimson returns nearly 75 percent of its scoring from last season—much of it concentrated in the sophomore class.
“One main thing is we have seven sophomores instead of seven freshman. I think that’s one of the biggest differences,” Towns said. “I think with all of us freshman last year having those roles and that translating into what we have now is really nice because there’s so much growth in everybody’s game.”
Also imperative to Harvard’s success is its emerging frontcourt. While much of the Crimson’s minutes last season were split between senior forward Zena Edosomwan and freshman Chris Lewis, the graduation of Edosomwan puts the bulk of the rebounding on Lewis coming into his second year. Lewis, along with classmates Robert Baker Jr. and Henry Welsh, will look to anchor a Harvard defense that has been the staple of Amaker’s tenure in Cambridge. Whether they’ll bring the same tenacity Edosomwan brought to Harvard remains to be seen.
Despite the questions surrounding the young squad, Amaker remains excited for the prospect of a new season.
“I think we’re kind of anxious to find out as we go against someone else,” Amaker said. “Kind of where we stand with certain things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, Harvard needed just one win to claim the Ivy League title. Penn and Yale did not oblige. This year, the Crimson needs two.
Between Harvard and a championship ring stands two teams—the Bulldogs and the Quakers. Even to have a shot at the top spot, the Crimson must escape its final home game of the year against Penn on Saturday unscathed.
The ask is large and the scene similar to the 2016 matchup in all but records. The Quakers (4-4, 2-3 Ivy), currently ranked sixth in the division, return to the position of spoiler for the third-straight season. In addition to keeping Harvard (5-3, 3-2) from a title last year, the team forestalled a perfect Crimson season in 2015.
The matchup between the two teams is even. So even that since 2001, the teams have split the results with eight wins apiece.
And while Penn is in the position to play the part of spoiler this year, the team is assuredly not an underdog. The Quakers’ record betrays their strength. The squad faced a rough first half of the season, taking a heavy loss to Central Connecticut State and then falling to Dartmouth, Columbia, and Yale. The Quakers looked to be on a path straight to the division's last place spot.
Then they downed Princeton.
The same team that hung 52 points on Harvard—the third-most in Crimson program history. Playing in front of a hostile crowd at Franklin Field, that Tigers team fell 38-35 to Penn.
This result, in addition to a rout of Brown, corroborated that the Quakers’ squad was legit. Now, the team has a distant shot at the Ancient Eight crown, in the unlikely event of a seven-way tie for first.
It would be strange to finish the season without either Penn or Harvard at the top. Since 1997, at least one of the teams has earned a share of the trophy 18 times, and 2007 was the last year that neither team finished at the one spot.
“[In] the 24 years we’ve been here, if there’s ever one program who it’s coming down to for the Ivy League Championship, it’s been Harvard and Penn,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They just happen to be a team that all of the sudden has a whole lot of momentum.”
In addition to the position the Quakers may play as the spoiler, the pieces even mirror the 2016 match. Penn returns wideout mainstays Christian Pearson and Justin Watson, a preseason All-American. In the 2016 match, both players hauled in over 100 yards.
Watson represents a particular threat, one that leads the FCS with 12 receiving touchdowns. The senior pro-prospect has 60 catches for 843 yards. For reference, Pearson ranks second on the Quakers’ roster for receiving touchdowns with just two. The Crimson has nine.
“He’s probably the best player in the league,” senior safety Tanner Lee said. “You just need to keep the ball in front of you and make sure he doesn’t turn stuff into big plays. As long as we prevent big plays and keep the ball in front of us, we’ll be fine.”
Harvard has its fair share of returning playmakers as well. Junior wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley has been a threat all season, not so much on the wing as on returns. The junior leads the FCS in both punt returns average and punt returns for touchdowns.
An unforeseen returner for the Crimson comes in the form of senior quarterback Joe Viviano who has reclaimed the starting position under center.
“Joe’s going to be the starter,” said Murphy concerning the swap. “I think he’s earned that.”
The fifth-year play caller initially lost the position to freshman Jake Smith and has not started since the week one loss to Rhode Island.
Last week, Smith was yanked after four interceptions, including three in the first quarter. A strong defensive performance limited the Lions to only seven points off Smith’s turnovers, and Harvard managed to pull out the win.
The Columbia game represented the first time that a quarterback had thrown three interceptions in a quarter since 2016. Specifically, since the 2016 game against Penn. More specifically, since Viviano threw those interceptions.
Last year against the Quakers, Viviano tossed the ball into the hands of awaiting defenders three times in the span of nine minutes and 55 seconds in the second quarter. Much like this year’s Columbia game, the defense stayed strong, not allowing Penn to capitalize on the turnovers. The Quakers’ only points of the half resulted from a pick-six on one of Viviano’s errant passes.
The two teams took to the second half four points apart, and were neck-and-neck as the final seconds ticked down. At 14-14, disaster struck for the Crimson when Watson hauled in six points with 15 seconds left. The visitors did not answer.
The loss kept Harvard from securing an Ivy League championship, as a defeat to Yale one week later ended the Crimson’s three-year title streak. Now Vivano makes his return against the defense that forced his worst game to date.
“[The emotions] carry over,” Lee said. “Penn is the only team my record is negative against. We definitely want to go out there and do our best to beat them.”
The last time that the Quakers came to Harvard, the Crimson sported an undefeated record and 22-game win streak. That 2015 game was just as evenly matched at halftime as the year prior, but with Harvard holding the four point advantage.
Penn scored in the third quarter to resume the lead, but the final nail in the coffin didn’t come to until the final stanza. A blur named Justin Watson outran the edge and then the world on his way to the Crimson end zone, successfully completing the 79-yard scoring run and the subsequent rout of Harvard.
The Quakers’ victory, while not enough to forestall the Ancient Eight Championship, did snap a 22-game win streak.The Crimson has not returned to the top of the division since.
Back in the present. Harvard finds itself in a spot few thought that it would be at the beginning of the season: vying for the division's top spot.
“Three weeks ago, you wouldn’t have thought that we’d be in the position to control our own destiny, albeit, one that’s going to be a much steeper slope and much more challenging than the last two weeks have been,” Murphy said. “As far as we’re concerned we’re playing with house money.”
Penn has Watson. The Crimson has Shelton-Mosley. In what has many seasons been the de facto title game, the stakes are much the same as they have been historically. Harvard needs to win in order to fight for a piece of the Ancient Eight crown. So do the Quakers.
“They have the skill players and weapons to be very dangerous,” captain linebacker Luke Hutton said. “They’re a very good football team and a very good offense. We’re playing the two best teams on our schedule in the last two games. That’s our mindset going in, and we’re ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HAMILTON, N.Y. — The Harvard men’s hockey team didn’t expect to be .500 heading into a much-anticipated matchup with Cornell on Saturday. Nevertheless, the No. 5 Crimson (2-2-0, 2-2-0 ECAC) fell to Colgate, 2-1, on Friday night, evening its record at just that.
By the mid-way point of the game, Harvard found itself in a two-goal hole. The Raiders (5-2-4, 1-0-1) were simply the more opportunistic team in Friday’s bout, cashing in on their chances despite being outshot 31-20.
“We had chances. I think we were in-tight all alone with the goalie probably four or five times,” coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[On] a couple of them, we need to bear down. We had empty nets before [the goalie] even knew the puck was there…. We need to find a way to generate more offense five-on-five.”
The disparity in shots came primarily from the Crimson’s efforts to tie the game in the third period. With the ice slightly tilted in favor of the more desperate team, Colgate sent only three shots on Harvard tri-captain Merrick Madsen in the final frame.
While play was more even, Harvard needed almost two whole periods to crack the code of sophomore goaltender Colton Point. In the final minute of the second frame, the Crimson finally cashed in on its fourth power play opportunity of the night when junior forward Ryan Donato buried a feed from sophomore Ty Pelton-Byce.
In the shifts leading up to the goal, Colgate made an overt effort to get under Donato’s skin—every time he touched the puck, the dynamic junior could count on an extra shove, elbow, or chirp coming his way. Donato answered these provocations with the man-up strike.
“Obviously it’s kind of hard to look past [the goal] now with the loss,” Ryan Donato said. “At the beginning, [the Raiders] were all up in my line’s grill. They were yelling at us, chirping us…trying to get us to retaliate. But we kind of held back, and scoring that goal definitely felt pretty good.”
Despite the power play goal, Harvard was still trailing 2-1 entering the final third of the game. As the Crimson mounted its come back, the puck spent more time in Point’s end of the ice and the shots accumulated. Still, grade-A scoring chances were scarce.
Of the high-quality attempts that Harvard did muster in the period, none was more promising than junior forward Michael Floodstrand’s point-blank chance with eight minutes remaining.
A puck fed to the net-front ricocheted off a pair of skates and bounced right onto the junior’s tape. Floodstrand took a touch too many, however, and by the time he put a shot on goal, Point was in slightly better position to make the save. A flailing Point got a piece of the puck, knocking it into the air where it was punched away to safety by a Raiders defenseman.
“It looked like we could’ve reacted a little bit quicker,” coach Donato admitted. “Hey, guys are trying hard. Nobody doesn’t want to score goals, so we’ll have to just keep working at it…. It’s hard to win hockey games without scoring a goal even-strength.”
Colgate opened the scoring on just its second shot of the game. Co-captain Mike Panowyk, exiting the penalty box after his team’s first infraction of the night, jumped right into a Raiders rush. The senior hopped on the puck and threaded a pass through backchecking Crimson skaters Adam Fox and Lewis Zerter-Gossage. The biscuit found the tape of linemate Jared Cockrell and, ultimately, the back of Madsen’s net.
“We had the momentum obviously, and then their guy jumps out of the box,” Ryan Donato remembered. “Then all of a sudden it’s a three-on-one and we were kind of lost.”
Later in the period, at the conclusion of defenseman Rory McGuire’s tripping penalty, Colgate once again tested Harvard with a threatening pass to the man leaving the sin bin.
Other than a few power play chances for the Crimson and the Raiders’ ensuing attempts to catch the visitors off-guard, the first period didn’t feature much more action. This was somewhat expected ahead of Friday’s bout, considering Colgate’s defense-first tendencies.
Through this young campaign, the man most responsible for the Raiders’ goal-preventing success has been Point. Colgate’s last line of defense, who entered the contest with a league-best 1.08 goals against average and .965 save percentage, posted his eighth scoreless first period through nine starts this season.
“You always got to expect [Point] to make the first save, maybe the first two saves. You got to get the rebounds,” Ryan Donato lauded. “He played really well tonight. We’re going to see him again. We just have to be ready for him next time.”
Even beyond the opening frame, Point’s acrobatic saves—and his defense’s concerted effort to block shots—kept Friday’s game a low-event, low-scoring affair.
The Crimson has no time to dwell on the loss, no matter how disappointing, as it arrives later tonight in Ithaca, N.Y., in advance of tomorrow’s Ivy League rivalry showdown with the Big Red.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an essential weekend against Ivy League and ECAC foes Brown and Yale, Harvard women’s hockey will look to extend its strong start to the season.
The Crimson (2-1-0, 2-1-0 ECAC) is hoping to maintain its upward trajectory heading into an important weekend with multiple ECAC matchups.
The start of the season looks promising for Harvard. After an impressive 6-1 win over McGill in an exhibition game, the Crimson picked up back-to-back wins over Ivy League foes Dartmouth and Princeton.
On the road at Quinnipiac, Harvard started out slow, with early penalties contributing to a quick 2-0 deficit. Although the Crimson scored late, the Bobcats held off a flurry of shots and Harvard’s comeback attempt came up just short.
“If we had played that whole game as we had played that third period… to keep fighting to the end is the way we want to be playing the entire season,” sophomore goalie Beth Larcom said.
Moving into an all-important weekend of ECAC matchups, Harvard will use the Quinnipiac game as a learning experience.
“We came out a little flat and we got down on penalties,” junior defender Kaitlin Tse said. “But we can rebound and get the momentum back.”
With its first Friday-Saturday slate weekend behind it, the Crimson will look to transition last week’s experience as it prepares for another weekend with back-to-back games on Friday and Saturday.
“It was the first weekend we had two games in a row,” junior forward Kate Hallett said. “After Friday’s game you just move on into Saturday.”
With ECAC points on the line in both games yet again, this weekend will prove important in the standings down the line. Harvard will look to capitalize on important conference matchups early in the year following last year’s underperforming 5-13-4 ECAC record.
Last season, the Crimson split its series with Brown (0-6-0, 0-4-0), each team winning on the road. Although Harvard took a 3-1 contest early in the year, the Bears topped the Crimson by the same score in the last year’s season finale. Brown will be looking for its first victory of the season, as the Bears have begun the year allowing 51 goals and netting only 10.
Harvard and Yale (1-4-1, 0-3-1) also split their season series last year. Yale took its home game 3-2, while the Crimson blanked the Bulldogs 5-0 at home later in the season. Yale is also looking for its first conference win on the year, and the rivalry with Harvard adds a special flavor to the game.
This will be the last time that the seniors host the Crimson’s storied rival on home ice, but Harvard will travel to New Haven in January for the second installment of the rivalry. Each player in a Crimson jersey understands the importance of the rivalry matchup.
“We are really excited,” Hallett said. “There’s always fun and hype around the game with lots of energy.”
For players on both sides, the game is more than just another conference matchup.
“The Harvard-Yale rivalry runs deep and we all know that, so it’s really exciting to step on the ice with them,” Larcom said. “Board battles get chippy, celebrations get big.”
Although Yale carries special meaning to the players, both games hold equal weight regarding conference play. Wins in both games could propel Harvard to the top of the ECAC standings early in the season.
“Every game we play is the biggest game for us,” Larcom said.
Due to the importance of the games, the Crimson has undergone intense preparation to improve upon its weaknesses from the start of the season.
“Something that’s going to be huge for us is focusing on taking it one shift at a time, breaking it down to the little things,” Hallett said. “We focus on every shift, every little thing.”
As always, Harvard will look to defend its home ice by approaching each game as its own entity.
“We’ll focus on Friday and then move into Saturday and do it again,” Hallett said.

Writing papers at Harvard is difficult because every TF is “unique” and “wonderful” in their own different ways. The range of Expos 20 TFs spans from “the best I ever had” to “the reason why I no longer concentrate in classics”. For those of you looking to boost “Syntax/Grammar” score from a 9 to a 13 out of 15, we’ve got you covered.
The Semicolon
“Please keep your response to five sentences or less.” is the guideline equivalent of telling someone to cut their lawn using a pair of scissors. The tools just can’t complete the task. Have two sentences that vaguely pair well together? Throw a semicolon in there. Your TF won’t care enough to debate you over whether or not the ideas pair closely enough to warrant the semicolon; they’re probably grading your submission at 3 a.m. under the influence of Moscato and Red Bull. It’s a guaranteed fix.
"Thus"
It’s a word that isn’t “in summary” or “in conclusion.” A “thus” has moxie. It has pizzazz. Your TF has just soldiered through seven pages of you mischaracterizing Dostoyevsky and is on the brink of a breakdown. A “thus” says, “Hey, Mark. You’re almost there. He’s done making points. Keep pushing.” It’s also a sexy way to wrap up your masterpiece. It’s a written mic drop. Take a second to recline in your chair and admire what you’ve done. You used a “thus”.
Et Al.
You put significant effort into assembling a bibliography to dupe your TF into thinking you did independent research. Want to spice up your in-essay references? Finesse an “et al.” in there. An “et al.” conveys that a bunch of people worked on this cited essay, but you don’t want your TF to have to pretend to read all of their last names. It is a way to demonstrate that (a) you don’t want to waste your grader’s time and (b) this claim is legit. Don’t be worried about using it incorrectly, too; most people don’t know how to either (Nava et al., 2017).

These tricks will put you above the mean paper score in your section (we hope). If not, we always suggest complementing your TF’s jacket or actually showing interest by attending office hours. We recognize that those are very tall asks, though. Good luck.
Victor C. Agbafe ’19 and Michael K. Bervell ’19 do not look much like bakers.
Yet, if campaign literature distributed across campus is any evidence, the two contend to be just that: according to their slogan, their campaign to lead the Undergraduate Council will offer each Harvard student “your slice of the pie.”
Agbafe and Bervell met during their senior year of high school when they both received the Coca-Cola Scholarship, travelling to Atlanta for a winners’ conference. Agbafe, a Dunster House UC representative and the ticket’s presidential candidate, got in touch with Bervell—a Kirkland House resident and the ticket’s candidate for vice president—online.
As fate would have it, they were soon placed in the same freshman entryway and quickly became friends.
Though they now live in different Houses, concentrate in different subjects, and belong to  different extracurricular groups, according to Agbafe, the two remained in contact, and they continued to cross paths until they decided to enter the race together.
“Some of our interests and passions in service would bring us together,” Agbafe said.
Their interest in student outreach is evident in the pair’s campus involvement: Agbafe, a Government concentrator, has represented his classmates on the UC since his freshman year, and Bervell, who concentrates in Philosophy, is involved in the Harvard Alumni Association and the Franklin Fellowship, a personal-development-based organization. Bervell is also an inactive Crimson editor.
If elected, Agbafe and Bervell say they plan to develop a comprehensive platform for “shaping” Harvard based on student opinion, “filling” out Harvard’s existing programs, and “baking,” or enacting policies they see as vital to improving students’ quality of life.
In creating their policy platform,  Agbafe and Bervell said they tried to come up with plans that are concretely actionable during a one-year term. The pair said that the most feasible task they plan to tackle upon entering office is to set up a social fund for student organizations.
Sponsored by alumni, startups, and larger companies, this $250,000 fund would be available for smaller student groups with low budgets to hold social events for members. The fund would also provide all undergraduates with a base Crimson Cash stipend, similar to the $65 per semester each student receives in BoardPlus. Agbafe and Bervell have yet to specify the amount each student would be given.
“It would make sense to have free printing, to have free laundry, and to be able to go into the Square and go to cool restaurants with your friends,” said Bervell.
Bervell said this proposal is the “number one” priority on their platform.
“Being able to raise a lot of money that we can give to the student organizations that don’t have money seems like a no brainer, and I’m surprised it hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Agbafe and Bervell also considered the College’s social group policy in making the social fund proposal.
The two said they do not support administration's penalties on members on unrecognized single-gender social organizations—which, starting with this year’s freshman class, bar members of these groups from holding certain fellowships and on-campus leadership positions.
Instead, Agbafe and Bervell said their proposed social fund ultimately looks to serve as an alternative to the penalties and give student groups equal resources to stimulate social life for those who choose not to participate in final clubs and Greek organizations.
They also tout their different social experiences at Harvard—Bervell is in the Owl Club, while Agbafe is not a member of any unrecognized social groups—as an asset to their ticket.
Agbafe and Bervell say they have formed these social policies through researching social life at peer institutions and conversations with student group leaders across campus, including both recognized and unrecognized groups.
“We’ve been meeting with the boards of particularly cultural organizations, women’s groups to get feedback on our ideas,” Agbafe said. “We’ve also been meeting with USGSOs. We recognize that they are part of the Harvard community and we want to hear their input.”
It seems as if their outreach has paid off: So far the Black Men’s Forum, Caribbean Club, Colombian Student Association, and Native Americans at Harvard College have endorsed Agbafe and Bervell.
Engaging in group dialogue is typical of the pair’s personalities and leadership style, according to friends and classmates. One such friend, Caroline Teicher ’19, said that one of Bervell’s strongest character traits is his skill at both providing and responding to feedback.
“He definitely values everything that everyone says,” said Teicher.
Caroline M. Tervo ’18 said she sees Agbafe in a similar light.
“I think he’s the textbook definition of an active listener: someone who’s really enthusiastic about hearing people’s point of views just for the sake of expanding his own perspective,” she said.
Agbafe and Bervell said that second on their list of top priorities is working to get electronic dispensers of menstrual hygiene products and contraceptives installed across campus. As explained in their policy platform, the candidates feel that availability of these products across campus is lacking.
They also said that socio-economic barriers may prevent students from accessing feminine hygiene products or contraception; for this reason, they intend to make all products available in the dispensers free of charge.
“We have no excuse as an institution not to provide those products for our students,” Agbafe   said. “Those products, they’re—it’s not just something that’s a luxury. It’s a human right, and that’s something that we definitely want to prioritize and push the administration to work with us on.”
Installing dispensers isn’t the only proposal the two have to promote physical health on campus. They also say they hope to support and provide resources for students who have experienced sexual assault.
Bervell said that that the candid conversations they have had with students who have been sexually assaulted have been instrumental in shaping their views on this issue.
“As two cisgender, heterosexual males, we’re never going to know what it’s like to be disproportionately sexually victimized,” Agbafe said, adding he thinks it is important to bring victims’ voices to light.
Agbafe and Bervell said their third area of focus will be installing a variety of eco-friendly resources to make student life more sustainable.
“Frankly, environmental justice is not brought up as a campaign ticket point at all at Harvard,” Bervell said. He and Agbafe plan to install composting stations next to every dining hall tray return.
Agbafe and Bervell said that students often fail to compost their waste, and that they hope to make the practice standard. They also want to make sure students understand why living sustainably and composting are important.
“Just to start that discussion for the next five years, the next ten years, especially because it’s becoming a bigger issue, is something that we want to be proactive about,” said Bervell.
They also want to start an affordable bike-sharing program for students. Their desire to increase sustainable living on campus is complemented with a social-fund-related initiative to subsidize costs for plants in students’ dorm rooms.
“It might be a free cactus fund because knowing how busy students are they may forget to water the plants,” said Bervell.
All in all, the duo’s pie-themed platform is reflected in the way they see Harvard. Their platform’s shape is also a result of what they see as their commitment to producing tangible results.
“There’s a lot of rhetoric, but not many action plans, actual steps, identifying what you want to solve,” said Agbafe. “This is what you can hold us accountable to. If we don’t, it is kind of a collaborative effort.”
They also want to be in constant communication not only with UC representatives, but their constituents themselves. A significant part of their platform is dedicated to communicating with Harvard students with digital polling and town halls.
“An institution like Harvard operates on a stakeholder kind of system,” said Agbafe. “Students, which, we think, are the biggest stakeholders on campus, can have the largest voice. Ideally use that to mobilize change in the way that the administration allocates resources.”
Voting for the election will begin at noon on Nov. 13 and will run till noon on Nov. 16.
At first glance, Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and her running mate Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 have had very different college experiences. Zhang concentrates in Psychology and has been involved in campus events from Freshman Formal to Housing Day celebrations. Boucher studies Computer Science and has won awards for his mobile application development. Zhang lives in the Quad; Boucher’s residence is clear across campus in the concrete expanse of Mather House.
Both candidates, though, have two years experience serving on Harvard’s Undergraduate Council under their belts. And, armed with a list of 39 policy proposals, they say they’re ready to run the Council together.
Zhang, who has been on the UC since her freshman fall, currently represents Cabot House on the Council. Boucher, who joined the UC the spring of his freshman year, is now a Mather House Representative as well as the Council’s Treasurer.
Boucher said he clearly remembers the first time he met Zhang during a UC meeting.
“I remember walking into the first meeting, and there being one particular representative who was so much louder than all the rest,” Boucher said. “And I thought, ‘There’s somebody I want to be friends with!’”
Two years later, the pair finds themselves running as a ticket for UC president and vice president.
Though they bring different backgrounds and specialties to the table, Zhang said she thinks their differences are “complementary.”
Though their approaches may be different, Zhang said, “our values are very, very similar.” Those values—transparency, staying focused on issues, and realistic goal-setting—have shaped their campaign policies, from the establishment of a multicultural center to a new “matchmaker” grant that would allow different student organizations to connect.
Of the three tickets vying for the UC presidency and vice presidency, Zhang and Boucher are the only ticket where both candidates have previously served on the Council. In their past two years on the UC, Zhang and Boucher have pushed for improvements both to life on campus and to the structure of the Council itself.
While Zhang served on the UC’s Freshman Class Committee as an Ivy Yard representative, she helped add new game tables, including air hockey and pool tables, that current freshmen now enjoy in their dorms’ common rooms. As a freshman, Zhang also helped initiate “Enhanced Brain Break,” where Annenberg Hall extended hours and expanded late night food options for freshmen.
Zhang also said she likes to think big. She mentioned her love for “event planning” and “large scale events.” As a member of the First Year Social Committee, she helped plan and run Haunted Hall, the Freshmen Formal, and the Housing Day Eve Carnival. Later, as a sophomore, she also helped plan the sophomore declaration event.
Zhang also previously served as chair of the Freshman Class Committee during her sophomore year.
“A big part of my work here at Harvard as a whole has been to empower and support freshmen,” Zhang said. “I love freshmen.”
While Zhang has mostly focused outward on changes to student life, Boucher has largely focused on how to make the UC itself more efficient. This February, he created Nova, a new online grant application system for the UC’s Finance Committee, on which Boucher serves.
“[Nova] is a technical system which provides online tracking for every grant application submitted to the UC,” he said. “[Student organizations] are able to track their grant just like they are able to track, say, a FedEx package online.”
But in addition to tracking the progress of funding, Boucher said his program has also saved the UC money by helping identify previous inefficiencies in the grant process.
“This whole summer, every night, that’s what I was doing,” Boucher said. “To watch that play out in real life has been unbelievable because the good that comes out of that makes all the hours worth it.”
Boucher also praised Zhang’s ability to encourage others on the Council to accomplish their goals.
“More so than anyone I’ve seen in the Council in the past two and half years, Cat is a motivating force,” Boucher said. “Yes, she’s done a lot, but on top of that, she’s the reason why a lot of people have done a lot.”
Zhang and Boucher emphasized the importance of transparency and communication between the UC and the student body at large.
Boucher noted that information about the UC’s actions is mostly disseminated by “third-party” groups like The Crimson.
“That’s the Council falling short,” he said. “It should be our civic responsibility to be reporting back continuously to the student body about what we’re doing.”
In order to make the UC’s actions more transparent and easily accessible next year, Zhang and Boucher said they would add progress bars to the UC website—like the ones currently used on the UC’s Nova platform. Zhang and Boucher hope that this way, students and student organizations would easily be able to track the progress the Council makes on its priorities.
“If we make a promise, it’s going on that list. And if we don’t do it, you should call us out on it,” Boucher said.
The list so far contains 39 goals, including advocating for textbook accessibility and hiring more full-time mental health counselors. Zhang said that although accomplishing all 39 goals in a single year would be unrealistic, but that their combined experience would also help their efficiency.
“We’ll have to pick a few to immediately start on because some are short-term,” Zhang said. “We could institute [them] ASAP.”
Other priorities, she said, would require more planning and meetings with administrators. But even for longer-term priorities, Zhang said she and Boucher would continue to inform students of the Council’s progress.
Zhang and Boucher outlined four main policy focuses for their campaign: mental health, sexual assault awareness and prevention, diversity and inclusion, and social spaces on campus.
Several of Zhang and Boucher’s proposals for mental health and sexual assault prevention include partnerships with different organizations at Harvard. Zhang said the duo have begun discussions with Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy organization on campus.
Zhang and Boucher also emphasized policies for improving inter-student relations and inclusion. Chief among them is their support for the creation of a multicultural center for students.
Boucher defined the idea for the center as “a physical space that exists on campus where students from any background” to find personal and academic resources. He also said it would serve as a “social space.”
Both Zhang and Boucher noted a prevalence of exclusive social spaces on campus and said they want to create a space where anyone could feel comfortable.
“What we imagine is a place somewhere, say in Harvard Square, somewhere proximate to the Yard in general, where there could be social events on Friday and Saturday nights and during the day,” Boucher said.
Although the idea for a multicultural center isn’t new, Zhang and Boucher said they want to make it a priority this year.
Their proposal follows recent controversy surrounding social spaces on campus, as College administrators have looked to impose sanctions on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Zhang and Boucher said they support the general idea of the sanctions, though they have some concerns about the administration’s implementation.
“The idea, the spirit of the legislation, we support,” Boucher said. “The actual execution has been really poor… It has been a flawed process, and I think if it was to be implemented as proposed now… people are going to get hurt in the process.”
To improve social life on campus, Zhang and Boucher said they would seek to create more inclusive spaces for students to spend time and meet people.
“If you're going to take something away, you need to build something up too so that you can supplement where social life is in an interim period,” Zhang said.
In addition to the multicultural center, the pair also wants to foster inter-student collaboration with a new “matchmaker grant.” The grant would provide funding to different student organizations—like a cultural group and a pre-professional organization—to have conversations together over food.
Zhang and Boucher also hope to facilitate student-faculty relationships in a more casual, low-pressure manner by offering regular dinners with faculty members in the Houses.
Zhang said that while existing programs like Classroom to Table put “the onus on students to make that connection with [faculty],” their new initiative would make the process lower-pressure by making it a lottery system. This would also allow students to interact “with faculty whom [they] might not have any interaction with before.”
In addition to working on initiatives, the UC president and vice president meet regularly with members of the university’s central administration, and would therefore work closely with the new University president, set to take office next year. Zhang and Boucher said that they hope that the new president is able to strike a balance in his or her duties both on campus and in the world.
“I hope whoever is in the next position will have that same dedication Faust had, but I also hope he or she will be able to sit down in a d-hall and talk with undergrad students or talk with the Undergraduate Council,” Boucher said.
Conor Healy ’19 and Parth C. Thakker ’19 are not afraid of controversy.
In their bid to serve as Undergraduate Council president and vice president, respectively, the two have developed a platform that does not shy from radical positions: Healy and Thakker hope to totally restructure the UC’s committee system and the yearly election process for UC House representatives.
But their most radical suggestion involves their proposed solution to the College’s efforts to penalize single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations over the past year-and-a-half. Administrators announced sanctions on members of these groups in May 2016 in an effort to minimize the social clout of Harvard’s final clubs, which Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and others say foster gender and race-based discrimination on campus.
Healy and Thakker’s solution? Create more final clubs.
“If you think final clubs are a problem, we agree,” Healy and Thakker wrote in their platform, posted online. “But the problem is that they are in such short supply. The idea of a final club is fundamentally appealing.”
If elected, Healy and Thakker want to help new final clubs “get off the ground and acquire space,” according to their platform.
But Healy and Thakker’s candidacy is controversial for reasons beyond their ticket. Healy has won both criticism and praise on campus for his founding of the Open Campus Initiative, an undergraduate group that aims to test the limits of Harvard’s free speech values by inviting what some students call hateful speakers to campus.
Healy acknowledged his work with the Initiative has drawn censure but said he is “not worried” this will affect his chances for the presidency. The two are similarly optimistic about their ability to implement the large-scale changes they propose—even though only Thakker has experience on the UC, having served as Kirkland House representative for the past several semesters.
Running under the banner “Fix Harvard,” the two point to Healy’s outsider status and the radical nature of their proposals as an advantage.
“Nobody currently on the UC—save for my fantastic running mate Parth—would ever propose the kind of serious change we want,” Healy wrote in his platform. “They live within the system. I don’t.”
Ever since University President Drew G. Faust announced penalties on members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, the sanctions have drawn national attention and polarized campus. Asked for their opinion in an interview Wednesday, Healy and Thakker did not mince words.
“We’re against the final club sanctions, wholeheartedly,” Healy said. “And we’ll do what we can to advocate for some change in that approach.”
Healy and Thakker’s published platform is even more direct, criticizing the UC for “push[ing] back so little” on what the two called “Rakesh’s senseless social policies.”
Over the past year, Khurana has largely become the face of the sanctions, which—starting with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships. Healy and Thakker said they think Khurana and other administrators are taking the wrong approach in trying to penalize final club members.
“To us, the longer-term solution seems obvious: create more of a good thing, and don’t destroy what we already have,” the two wrote in their platform, referring to final clubs.
Healy and Thakker said they think administrators should fork over office space to serve as houses for new, final club-type student social groups.
“I mean Harvard occupies most of the good real estate in Harvard Square,” Healy said Wednesday. “All these little offices and dean-lets who occupy them make it nearly impossible for groups to establish the kinds of spaces that they have done regularly at other universities.”
“So they’re crowding us out,” he added.
Healy and Thakker specifically suggested that administrators convert venues like the Office of International Education, the Office of Fellowships, and the Office of Career Services into spaces for student social groups. Healy said he recognized this plan would be expensive, but said he believed Harvard “has the money set aside.”
In an interview in September, Khurana said the College has undertaken a number of initiatives to expand the social offerings available to students on campus. He particularly pointed to new party venues in residential student Houses, the ongoing renovation of the Smith Campus Center, and the recently redone Cabot Science Library.
The candidates also suggested that social life on Harvard’s campus could be improved by updating University policies to permit marijuana on campus and by establishing an “open door policy” for alcohol in freshman dormitories. Under this system, administrators would allow freshmen to drink alcohol as long as they kept the door to their room open. Currently, alcohol is banned from freshman housing.
According to Healy and Thakker’s online platform, this policy would allow for better communication between proctors and students and for a “much safer relationship with alcohol.”
Another core tenet of Healy and Thakker’s platform involves restructuring the UC. As it is now, the current UC system leads to a representative organization that “doesn’t reflect the student body,” Healy said.
The candidates propose significant updates to UC structure: They want to change the way UC House representative elections are held and the way the UC appoints undergraduates to serve on University committees.
Currently, elections for UC House representative positions take place online: Students submit their votes through a digital form. Healy and Thakker said they think this structure leads to poor voter turnout. Instead, the duo propose holding UC elections in House dining halls and requiring students to come and vote in person.
“Elections ought to be a yearly tradition within the Houses and Dorms that people participate in, and look forward to,” the two wrote in their online platform. “An in-person vote in an important public space is how these essential choices should be made.”
The two also hope to alter the UC committee system. As it stands now, elected UC officials are responsible for nominating members to various student and student-faculty committees.  The candidates said they think this system is too laid-back—Thakker said that, in practice, joining one of these committees only requires sending an email to the relevant UC member.
“If you’re the only person who’s contacted them to be on the committee, that’s it, you’re on the committee,” Thakker said.
Healy and Thakker said they would like to make this selection system more rigorous. The two propose electing individuals to serve on committees through a popular vote. Both said they think electing students to committees through a vote would give undergraduate committee members greater legitimacy.
“Those are extremely important roles,” Thakker said.  “The students who are chosen for those committees have an enormous say.”
Healy and Thakker said they are well aware of some students’ negative opinion of the Open Campus Initiative.
The group’s guest lecturers—including conservative political scientist Charles A. Murray ’65, who has alleged intellectual inequality among racial groups—have often drawn student protests. Healy said classmates have confronted him in the dining hall and criticized the Initiative as a “Nazi group” at least three times.
“I don’t know how we’re defining Nazi here, but that seems like a real stretch of the imagination because that’s just crazy,” Healy said. “More than half of our members are card-carrying Democrats.”
Thakker said he and Healy discussed the group and its relationship to their campaign at length before announcing their ticket. After talking it through with Healy, Thakker—who said he is not a member of the initiative—said he came to better appreciate the group and its role on campus.
He said he now understands the real purpose of the effort: to invite speakers on both ends of the political spectrum and to encourage necessary debate on campus.
“Communicating that effectively to the voters and other students who may not have that idea may be a challenge or may not, but that’s certainly something that we spent time talking about before we decided to run,” Thakker said.
Healy said that, if elected, he almost certainly plans to step down as president of the Open Campus Initiative. But he said he will remain committed to promoting free speech on campus.
“Do I intend to change my tune on these issues? Absolutely not,” he said.
