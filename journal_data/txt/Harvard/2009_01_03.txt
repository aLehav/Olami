After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team opened 2009 in the best way possible, besting Santa Clara 73-68 at Lavietes Pavilion on Friday.The Crimson (7-6) got balanced scoring production as four players were in double figures, with junior guard Jeremy Lin leading the way with 17 points and junior forward Doug Miller scoring a career-best 15 points. Senior guard Drew Housman had 16, with freshman forward Peter Boehm adding 13.Harvard used this balance, as well as some excellent ball control and defense, to overcome a big size disadvantage against the Broncos (7-8). Led by 6’11, 275 lbs. center John Bryant, Santa Clara outrebounded the Crimson 42 to 24, but committed 20 turnovers against just six for Harvard.“We knew they were going to be tough inside, but we have a lot of speed and our gameplan was to run ’em and run ’em the entire night,” Housman said. “It worked out for us, we executed pretty well.”Leading for most of the game, the Crimson dug down to get away from the Broncos three times when the visitors made it close in the second half. Trailing 37-36 early on after the break, Housman faked and drove to the hoop for a traditional three-point play, giving the team a lead it would not give up again. Lin copied Housman with his own three-point play on the next possession, then captain guard Andrew Pusar put back a miss to make it 44-37.Miller put back his own miss the next time up the floor, but Santa Clara would pull back to make it 47-43 with 12:08 left. Lin answered with a quick bank shot. Boehm then hit an open three and Lin followed this, after taking a pass from freshman guard Oliver McNally at the top of the key, with a bullet pass down low to an open Miller for a layup as the Crimson went up 54-43 midway through the half.The Broncos did not fold, however, and brought Bryant and three teammates back into the game, including Kevin Foster, who hit two quick threes. The visitors soon closed within four, at 54-50, with 8:04 left to play.Harvard yet again had an answer. Off a pick-and-roll, Lin found Miller for a layup, one of his nine assists, matching his career-high against just one turnover. “He made every right decision, being so unselfish and making plays and finding shots for his teammates,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s such as huge weapon for us with what he brings to the table.”After Pusar stole a pass on the next possession, Lin recorded another of his assists as he drove and dished to McNally who nailed a big three-pointer.The Harvard defense really clamped down too, allowing just one field goal, a put-back by Bryant that McNally immediately answered with a long jumper with 4:20 left. The Crimson capped its strong run with some more playmaking from Lin. With the shot clock running down, he drove and kicked to Pusar, who buried a three from the corner, making it 64-53 with 2:17 left. Santa Clara kept at it, but solid free throw shooting by the home team kept it at least a two-possession contest to the end. In the first half, Harvard came out smoking and led by double figures for most of the half before the Broncos rallied to cut the deficit to two at the break, 31-29. Miller led the charge on both ends, scoring six points on 3-of-3 shooting, including two reverse layups around Bryant off passes from Lin.On the defensive end, he bodied up Santa Clara’s big man, despite giving away four inches and 55 pounds, limiting his touches and effectiveness.“I’m so proud of how Doug played,” Amaker said. “He gave us incredible effort on the interior. I was really proud with how he finished around the goal and rebounded the basketball.”Bryant finished with 14 points, 11 rebounds, and five blocks, four of them off shots by freshman forward Keith Wright, who was making his second appearance after suffering from mono. Foster added a game-high 20 points, but it was not enough to overcome the suffocating defense and consistent shooting from Harvard.“I definitely think this is one of the best team games we have had all year,” Lin said. “That’s good to build on, especially with the Ivy League two games away.’The Crimson’s Ivy opener is Jan. 10 at Dartmouth, and it has one more tune-up before then as it travels to local rival Boston College on Wednesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WILLIAMSBURG, VA.—In the first ever matchup between the two oldest universities in the country, Harvard could not rise to the occasion, dropping a tough road tilt to William and Mary, 67-54, on New Year’s Eve.The Crimson (6-6) struggled from the start to contain the much taller and bigger Tribe (5-6) squad. The team was outrebounded 49-26, outscored in the paint 30-14, and outplayed by a much larger lineup.Returning from mononucleosis, which had sidelined him since the Dec. 10 game against Northeastern, freshman Keith Wright fought hard in front of his family and friends, but was obviously struggling the entire time. The Suffolk, Va., native finished with four points on 2-of-8 shooting, leaving the Crimson weak down low.It was too much for Harvard to overcome.“We have to guard our paint better,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We got to have our post players play bigger, but it was hard, with Keith Wright coming back having missed a couple of games…but we can play better than we did this afternoon from an interior standpoint.”One bright spot for the Crimson was the play of junior Dan McGeary, who keyed a late comeback in the second half with his hot shooting. The junior finished with 18 points on 4-8 shooting from downtown.The run started with Harvard trialing William and Mary 42-33 with twelve minutes to play. The Crimson needed a spark, and McGeary was the one to give it to them. In a span of just over four minutes, McGeary knocked down three trifectas, with the final one coming as he fell to the ground. He lifted himself back up with 6:46 to play and Harvard then up, 48-47, following a 15-5 run. “The last couple of games, we’ve played some teams with zone defenses,” McGeary said. “Today, I was helped by a couple of guys—Oliver [McNally] and Max [Kenyi]—driving and kicking it out.”While Wright failed to get back in sync, fellow freshman Max Kenyi finally seemed to find his stride. Inconsistent all year, Kenyi had a good outing, pacing the Crimson offensive attack until McGeary caught fire. And with junior standout Jeremy Lin struggling mightily in going 3-of-12 from the field, Kenyi’s play kept Harvard in it.Without production form Lin, however, the Crimson could not recover.After regaining the lead with 6:46 to play, Harvard went cold, tallying only four points to finish the game.“We had some deflating plays that hurt us when they were making their strong runs,” Amaker said.
