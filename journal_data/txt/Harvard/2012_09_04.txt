After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve always hated New Hampshire.
Freshmen remember it fondly as the state they camped through for FOP. Upperclassmen flock to it as the land of tax-free booze. I know it as home, and I take it as a huge compliment when someone mistakes me for a citizen of almost anywhere else.
My problem with New Hampshire goes way back. I don’t know where or when it started; maybe it was after one too many tumbles skiing down the bunny slope, or after spending hours tracking deer through the woods behind my house for a seventh-grade science project. Maybe it was the time I discovered a squirrel hiding in a potted plant in our living room, or the time I found a bat hanging from the ceiling beam above our TV. Regardless of how it began, I prefer the indoors to the outdoors, city streets to dirt roads, and leather flats to snow boots. 
So when I caught mononucleosis at the end of last semester and had to come home for the summer to recover, I was not amused. The summer after junior year is supposed to be a big eye-opening experience, when you figure out, to some extent anyway, where you want to be after graduation. I’ve known that I do not want to be in New Hampshire since a nor’easter ruined my fifth birthday party.
But I had no options come the end of May; I was too sick to go anywhere but home. It was like someone had hit the pause button on my life. From my perch on the couch I watched as my sister packed a bag to go hiking with her friends and my father tethered kayaks to the top of his SUV. I clicked through photos of classmates in faraway places and talked to friends about their internships and jobs.
Meanwhile, I was mostly sleeping. There was very little to report about my life in New Hampshire. I dreaded the inevitable question: “What are you up to?” Sometimes I managed a cheerful “Not much!” Most of the time I mumbled a bitter, “Nothing.”
At some point during these weeks of inactivity, I read Tim Kreider’s “The Busy Trap” in the New York Times, which looked at our culture’s preoccupation with maintaining overscheduled lives.  Kreider wrote about adult circles, in which mothers run from boardroom meeting to soccer game and young professionals struggle to squeeze in a drink with friends. But I realized the same thing was happening in my dorm room at college, the place that is supposed to be a responsibility-free break between our high school helicopter parents and our demanding bosses at future jobs.
Harvard students love talking about how busy they are. And many of us really are living life at a breakneck speed, sprinting through classes, extracurriculars, meals, friendships, reading assignments, and phone calls home. But more than just reflecting a zest for life, being busy is a status symbol among the ambitious. Our hectic schedules and endless commitments mean we must be important. Busyness implies that we have more than our peers—more meetings, more friends, more extracurriculars, and more drive. It means we are somehow getting ahead of everyone else in a game no one can quite name.
So responding “Nothing,” when asked what I was up to, was humiliating. Even though it was medically mandated, I was ashamed of the absence of an important internship in my life and guilty about my lack of activity. I could hear my résumé calling out from within the depths of my computer, “What about me?” 
I struggled against taking a break from my “busy” life, but in the end, mono won. Sleeping wasn’t a commodity I could put off until the weekend, or until a paper was done, or until Thanksgiving break. It was something that was happening, whether I liked it or not, for 16 hours a day, every day. Resistance was futile; I eventually surrendered to a summer lazed away in New Hampshire.
I came to appreciate the thing I had always hated most about being in New Hampshire: an abundance of time. I have spent years rushing through high school and Harvard, terrified of what would happen if I fell behind in the race we are all running. Well, if I was in that race, I have certainly fallen behind after my three-month-long hiatus. Yet I think I have gained more than I’ve lost. Without the constant din of papers to write and reading to do, and without the quiet guilt of knowing I have friends to see and a mother to call, I have discovered that life lived slowly is a worthwhile enterprise.
Don’t get me wrong: I will never be okay with wildlife visiting my living room, and I will always hate myself a little bit for thinking Dunkin’ Donuts coffee tastes like home even though Starbucks is so much better. But I have grown fond of a chair on the back porch. I’ve enjoyed books the way I did before I knew what comparative literature was, and I have spent hours writing e-mails to friends I haven’t talked to in years. I am almost never sleep deprived; now I drink coffee because I really like coffee. And I no longer hear my résumé calling. Maybe it’s given up on me. Or maybe I just can’t hear it from the porch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I drove my mother to Midwest Eye Centers three times last July. Three months earlier, she suffered from partial posterior vitreous detachment. This isn’t life-threatening, but it requires regular screenings to avoid serious nerve breakage that would require costly surgery. Medicaid notified her on the first of July that this would be last month she was eligible for insurance, because of cuts to the Illinois healthcare budget. We made sure to take advantage of her coverage that month. I was afraid.
We’ve got a problem with healthcare. This is not just a problem for my mom, but for your moms too, and for your professor, and for the homeless men in Harvard Square. There are 49 million uninsured people in this country, and 25 percent of them are parents. The average premium for a family is $15,073 a year and rising. Some people, yes, even children with cancer, used to be denied coverage just a few years ago.
But beginning in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, many of these uninsured people began seeing expanded coverage. Three million previously-uninsured Americans under age 26 now have coverage, as well as thousands of children with pre-existing conditions. Beginning in 2014, no one can be denied coverage due to health problems. Other new benefits include free preventative services like vaccinations, check-ups for children, and blood pressure and cholesterol tests for people with insurance. 
Perhaps most importantly, the ACA can expand coverage to 24 million Americans in 2014 through Medicaid expansion. This expansion will be covered by federal dollars until 2020, when the states will have to contribute 10 percent of the costs. However, several Republican governors have promised to reject federal dollars to expand their Medicaid programs. If only their constituents knew that their leaders were sacrificing their health to protect their political reputations, a few of these bleeding red states might turn blue.
Medicaid is a state-run program and each state has different eligibility rules. In Texas, working parents must make below 26 percent of the Federal poverty level ($23,050 for a family of four) to qualify for Medicaid. Even a single mother with three children who works as a waitress and makes $15,000 a year is not eligible. In Texas and 26 other states, mostly Republican voting, childless adults cannot receive Medicaid at all. 
Other states, like Governor Romney’s home state of Massachusetts, offer Medicaid for adults earning up to 133 percent of the poverty level. As it happens, Massachusetts has the lowest uninsured rate in the country. The ACA makes every state like Massachusetts: Citizens earning less than 133 percent of the poverty line will qualify for Medicaid. (However, 23 million illegal immigrants will still not be eligible.)
To pay for this expansion of Medicaid, the Federal Government will pay 100 percent of the costs to expand care until 2019, when it will pay 90 percent. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that this expansion will cost $930 billion over the next 10 years. Some states that will benefit the most from this changed rule are Alabama, Nebraska, South Carolina, and Mississippi.
Ironically, all of these states sued to defeat the act.
As a result of the June Supreme Court ruling, these states have the right to accept or reject funds to expand Medicaid. Already, governors in Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana have vowed to refuse them.
Their reasoning? Money. These states’ governors whistled the same old tired tune: that Obama is spending at the wrong time. What they fail to realize is that the expansion only accounts for 2 percent of the federal budget, and only 3 percent of the health budget. (On the other hand, 20 percent of the budget goes to defense spending.)
In fact, the ACA has measures in place to actually reduce the deficit, lower health care costs, and improve the economy. In 2014, the so-called “health care exchanges” will open. The exchanges are regulated, online mini-malls that allow customers to compare insurance plans easily. This transparency will increase competition and lower premiums. Customers between 133-400 percent of the poverty line can even obtain tax credits to help pay these premiums. Benefits of the ACA, including administrative savings, a sharp reduction in unpaid hospital bills, and increased taxes on drug companies and individuals making more than $250,000, are actually predicted to lower the federal deficit by $124 billion over the next 10 years.
The Affordable Care Act is effective, and the federal money for Medicaid expansion is too good to refuse. Republicans know this, but they will still be sure to call the law ineffective, socialistic, and economically suicidal in an attempt to convince their constituents that this antidote is poison. By doing so, these Republican politicians will stand between millions of middle-class patients and their doctors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the recent announcement of an investigation into the allegations that 125 students cheated during the Government 1310 take-home final last spring, Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences has certainly accomplished its goal of promoting a conversation on academic dishonesty. Across the country, numerous publications have covered the issue, thrusting it to the forefront of public debate. While each account approaches the situation from a different angle, much of the discussion focuses on the ethics of collaboration.
The definition of collaboration has become increasingly nebulous, and the difference between acceptable and unacceptable collaboration even more so. Take home exams in particular have become uncomfortable gray areas in which both spheres often overlap. It falls on the university to articulate the boundaries of student collaboration; only through greater clarity can we hope to avoid an incident like this in the future. 
Such a scandal is likely partially the product of the results-oriented culture that we see in many areas of this university, where students are often willing to trade ethical conduct for expedience. The instant gratification of appropriating another student’s ideas can seem particularly attractive as a result of this culture, where many behaviors can be excused as means to various ends. This dynamic necessitates stricter and clearer regulation of collaboration so as not to provide a further incentive to cut corners for short-term results. 
It is worth noting the role technology plays in this situation. The proliferation of hardware capable of quickly and cheaply disseminating ideas has made information more readily accessible than ever before in the 376 years of Harvard’s existence. With students exposed to the ideas of thousands of individuals on any given subject that they can distribute nearly instantaneously, the temptation to share work is grater than ever. This only accentuates the need for clearer enunciation of the regulations surrounding working with classmates. 
None of this is to say that the alleged acts of academic dishonesty were the result of confusion. The take-home exam expressly prohibited sharing thoughts or answers with other students or faculty—this was unambiguously stated in the instructions at the top of the test. If these transgressions did in fact happen, they were not the product of a misunderstanding, but the willful defiance of course policy. If guilty, the offending students are personally and exclusively responsible, and should be subject to the appropriate disciplinary action from the administrative board. That said, no punishment would address the underlying problem, which is a lack of awareness on campus. 
While it is unclear exactly what form clarification should take, efforts to articulate appropriate academic conduct are not without precedent. In all expository writing courses, which are mandatory for freshmen, teaching fellows are responsible for devoting a session to outlining College rules on plagiarism, as well general discussion of the subject, especially in relation to digital sources.  While its efficacy may be in question, the level of emphasis is not—this is a model that the administration should follow. The College puts considerable effort into educating undergraduates on the perils of taking from the work of fellow scholars; there should be equal focus on safeguarding the work of fellow students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost every month, a pair of students has the privilege of walking into Massachusetts Hall and University Hall, the two stateliest and most secretive buildings in Harvard Yard. They tote laptops or notepads and recording devices. Their mission is to enter the spaces where Harvard’s leaders work and pose the questions that ordinary students—and concerned individuals worldwide—might want to ask, about safety on campus in light of two recent rapes or just about what President Drew G. Faust thought of The Social Network. Whatever the burning question of the day might be, they aim to walk out of those buildings with the answers.
 But after the conversation ends, those two Crimson reporters who have just conversed with President Faust or Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 or Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds or another administrator do not step back into the Yard with a notebook full of quotes to share with the waiting world. In fact, when they leave, they cannot tell anyone a single word that those administrators said.
 They are constrained by an anti-journalistic practice known as quote review. In order to print the quotations from those interviews, they must first gain the approval of the administrator who said the words or a spokesperson at Harvard Public Affairs and Communications. Sometimes nothing is changed. But often, the quotations come back revised, to make the wording more erudite, the phrasing more direct, or the message more pointed. Sometimes the quotations are rejected outright or are rewritten to mean just the opposite of what the administrator said in the recorded interview.
 The Crimson has had a years-long agreement with HPAC that allowed interviews only on the condition of quote review with several administrators, and of late, more and more Harvard leaders have only agreed to speak to Crimson reporters if they could approve their quotes prior to publication. As a result, their quotations have become less candid, less telling, and less meaningful. These interviews are ceasing to fulfill their purpose—to capture and channel the forthright, honest words of Harvard’s decision-makers to all those who might be affected by the decisions. It is time for these constrained interviews to come to an end.
 In August, we enacted a new policy at The Crimson forbidding our reporters from agreeing to interviews on the condition of quote review without the express prior permission of the President or the Managing Editor. Given our belief that quote review runs counter to the most important principles of openness and truth on which journalism is grounded, we do not foresee that we will be willing to grant such permission to our reporters this semester.
 We share this internal decision with you, our readers, because you have put your trust in us to bring you fair, unbiased, rigorously reported news, and we are grateful every day for that faith. As custodians of your trust, we feel bound to tell you about the ways in which we strive to live up to our responsibility—to answer the questions so important to us all as members of the Harvard community.

 
E. Benjamin Samuels ’13 and Julie M. Zauzmer ’13 are the President and Managing Editor of the 139th Guard of The Harvard Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what has been one of the most competitive Massachusetts primaries of the 2012 election season, Republicans Sean Bielat, Elizabeth Childs, and David L. Steinhof will face off Thursday, Sept. 6 in the GOP primary in hopes of taking on the well-backed political newcomer Joseph P. Kennedy III in the newly redrawn Fourth Congressional District.
Bielat and Childs, the two frontrunners for the party nomination, have spent their campaigns highlighting their differences from Kennedy, who is expected to handily win his own Democratic primary on Thursday. Bielat, Childs, and Kennedy all hold Harvard degrees.
The Fourth Congressional District, represented for decades by retiring Congressman Barney Frank ‘61-’62, grew slightly in redistricting following the 2010 census. The district picked up several right-leaning cities in the southeast of the state which are expected to bring the new Fourth slightly to the right.
Bielat has focused his campaign on the economy, pledging to bring job-creating fiscal expertise and an academic eye to Washington, where he feels legislators are side-stepping the real problems facing the country.
“The lack of understanding of basic economics are a part of the problem,” Bielat said in an interview this spring. “So what you get are these really ideological arguments around policy implementation that really go on party lines.”
Childs, a Brookline physician, has presented herself as a more centrist Republican. Pro-choice and vocal about education reform, Childs has said she hopes to bring a physician’s eye to Congress to better evaluate health care reform and fiscal issues.
“Medicine is always weighing probabilities, uncertainties, risk and benefits and making decisions that have a major impact with limited information. If you think about it, that is what we need people to be able to do in government,” Childs said.
Lawrence S. DiCara ‘71, a former Boston City Councillor and longtime fixture of the Mass. political scene, said voter turnout in the Republican primary will likely be low because of a scarcity of registered Republicans in the district.
Todd Domke, a Boston-based Republican political consultant, saidthat it is likely that the southern, more conservative part of the district will back Bielat and the more liberal north will support Childs. Steinhof should earn some support from right-wing conservatives but is unlikely to win the nomination, Domke said.
Bielat has been considered the Republican favorite since he entered the race last fall. A former Marine and technology executive, he tried unsuccessfully to unseat Frank two years ago, drawing much national attention and financial support before ultimately losing by 11 points.
While Bielat was seen as a young rising star of the Republican party in 2010, his campaign has been muddled this time around by questions surrounding less-that-transparent campaign finance and personal history. But it was the emergence of another rising star, Kennedy, that really hurt the Republican frontrunner, experts said.
A former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, Childs and her campaign suffered early in the race from a lack of visibility. In an unorthodox response, she spent the summer exploring the district in an Airstream Trailer, trying to maximize her exposure.
By far the most conservative candidate seeking the nomination, Steinhof’s campaign has struggled to gain traction.
Though the Fourth Congressional District is thought to have become slightly more conservative in the wake of redistricting earlier this year, DiCara said Kennedy will be the favorite over any Republican candidate nominated Thursday.
“I don’t think either of them comes close against Joe,” DiCara said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three Republican candidates will go head to head Thursday, Sept. 6 for a chance to take on 36-year incumbent Democratic Congressman Edward J. Markey, in the newly-reconfigured Fifth Congressional District this November.
Lawyer Frank J. Addivinola, Jr., financial consultant Jeffrey M. Semon,  and consulting actuary Tom Tierney are all vying for a spot on the general election ballot. The longest serving member of the Massachusetts Congressional delegations, Markey previously represented what was the Seventh District.
Massachusetts lost a seat in Congress in the wake of the 2010 Census, triggering statewide redistricting. Amidst that redistricting, Cambridge was split into two districts, now called the fifth and seventh. The area of central Cambridge that includes Harvard as a result switched from the Eighth to the Fifth District. Congressman Michael E. Capuano, who previously represented Harvard, will now run in the Seventh District.
Boston political veteran Lawrence S. DiCara ‘71 said both new districts should be safe Democratic strongholds. If anything, he said, the new Fifth should lean farther to the left, making Markey, who has won 18 consecutive elections with 60 percent or more, very hard to beat.
“I don’t think any of those people are going to give Markey a run for his money,” DiCara said. “This is not one where any one of them are going to come close. It is a heavily Democratic district. It is probably more Democratic that it was before.”
Both Tierney and Addivinola have run for elective office before. Tierney has been a perennial candidate, while Addivinola lost a bid for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in 2010. Semon, whom the Boston Globe endorsed earlier this week, has never before sought public office.
Running as a staunch fiscal conservative, Semon has proposed repealing the Affordable Care Act and building a stronger border to slow illegal immigration. Addivinola and Tierney have largely propelled their own campaigns, gathering signatures and trying to drum up debate.
None of the Republican candidates have raised more than $25,000. Markey, by contrast, has brought in nearly $1 million in contributions.
Because of the scant number of registered Republicans in Cambridge, Thursday’s primary is expected to be a low tallying affair. DiCara said 1500 to 2000 votes will likely be enough to push a Republican over the top.
Also on their respective party ballots on Thursday: Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Senator Scott Brown, who are both running unopposed ahead of their face-off in November’s general election for U.S. Senate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who took Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” in recent years describe a course with a noted culture of collaboration, a practice that eventually led to alleged widespread cheating after the professor added a difficult short answer component to the course’s take-home exams.
Some students have expressed frustration or dismay at the unexpected difficulty and changed expectations in the spring 2012 version of the course.
The lecture class entered the national spotlight following Harvard’s announcement on Thursday that it is currently investigating about 125 students for plagiarizing responses or inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in a spring course. Though the administration did not disclose the name of the class, The Crimson reported that it was Matthew B. Platt’s government class.
Platt, who came to Harvard in 2008, has taught the course for the past three spring semesters. He, as well as former teaching fellows, declined or did not respond to requests for comments on the case.
The course’s overall score on the Q Guide has declined over the past three years, falling slightly from 3.70 in spring 2010 to 3.57 in spring 2011. The score dipped more sharply in spring 2012 to a 2.54, following the introduction of the new exam format.
All three years, grades for the course have been calculated based on four equally-weighted take home exams, each worth 25 percent of the final grade.
In spring 2010 and spring 2011, students received the same instructions on each exam, according to the syllabi: write a three-to-five page paper responding to your choice of one of three prompts.
Several students being investigated for cheating in the course in spring 2012 said they had friends in the course in previous years who collaborated on exams using the same practices that landed the students themselves under investigation by the Administrative Board.
Students also said the essay-only exam format contributed to Government 1310’s increasing reputation as an easy course. Fifty-seven percent of students in spring 2010 and 67 percent of students in spring 2011 who evaluated the course’s difficulty on the Q Guide rated the class as “easy” or “very easy.”
But in spring 2012, Platt changed the format of his exams, replacing the essay question with a short answer section containing several multi-part questions, many of which had a definitively right or wrong answer.
The fourth and final take-home exam, which sparked the plagiarism scandal, featured both a short answer section and an essay question.
Students say the new exam format may have also made cheating easier and more obvious to spot. One sophomore who took Government 1310 last spring said that it would be “quite easy to copy” answers in the short answer section of the exam.
Q Guide data suggests that these changes made the course more difficult. In spring 2012, only 16 percent of students who rated the course’s difficulty on the Q Guide called it “easy” or “very easy,” and 37 percent of evaluators rated the course as “difficult” or “very difficult.”
Two students in the class who are not being investigated said they found many of the final exam questions were confusing, leading both of them to email their teaching fellows for clarification.
Eventually, in two emails sent to the class on April 30, Platt was compelled to clarify three short-answer questions on the final exam in response to “some good questions” that he had received about it.
Two students who took the class in 2012 said that they observed other students collaborating on the final exam, which the exam instructions explicitly prohibited. One of those students, another sophomore who took the class in 2012, said that he was approached by students outside Lamont Library who invited him to join them in collaborating.
“It was very obvious that it was going on,” he said. “It was one of those things that wasn’t necessarily trying to be covered up.”
The student added that he felt frustrated with the unprecedented difficulty of the class in 2012, as he had heard it described as an easy class and had already committed to taking five courses that semester.

Large-scale cheating scandals at the University of Virginia, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Dartmouth may offer insight into the approach Harvard may take in doling out punishments to students found guilty of academic dishonesty in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
On Thursday, the College announced that it was investigating about 125 students for allegedly plagiarizing answers or inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in a spring course, which The Crimson reported was assistant professor Matthew B. Platt’s government class.
Harvard administrators may look to a similar case uncovered in 2001 at the University of Virginia, which resulted in a 20-month investigation of 122 students accused of cheating in a physics course. That probe ultimately ended in the dismissal of 45 students and the revocation of three degrees.
Louis A. Bloomfield, the physics professor who discovered several strings of identical words in the term papers for his class, “How Things Work,” said that he hopes that Harvard will keep in mind that these students are still maturing when deciding their punishments.
“If they misbehave, you don’t execute them, you teach them,” Bloomfield said. “I think that whatever Harvard decides to do, it should be very careful to have an educational purpose to the punishments it doles out. These are educational institutions, they should educate.”
At Virginia, a still-standing “hallowed” honor code put in place during the mid-1800s dictates that the only punishment for violations, including plagiarism, is dismissal from the university—a stipulation that Bloomfield called “a death penalty” for students.
Harvard does not have an honor code, though the introduction of one is currently in discussion by the College's Committee on Academic Integrity.
Although 122 students were initially implicated in the scandal at Virginia, the number was later reduced to some 70 students. Roughly 20 of those students ultimately did not receive a punishment because the degree of plagiarism did not warrant dismissal from school, which suggests that the number of students implicated in the allegations at Harvard may decrease as investigations continue.
Although Bloomfield still teaches the class, he decided to make certain changes to the course following the scandal, including decreasing the class size by half and no longer assigning take home exams, choices that Platt could consider as the spring semester of the course approaches.
Bloomfield predicted that the investigation process could be messy and extremely taxing for Platt.
“No good will come of this to the professor who found it,” Bloomfield said. “I lost two years of my life to that honor mess...It may be hard to survive.”
Platt has declined or not responded to repeated requests for comment on the case.
Bloomfield said Virginia pressured him to remain silent while in the public eye, adding that when he did not chose to do so, he “got a lot of heat.” He said that he went from being highly respected in the administration to being “invisible,” an experience he described as “very painful.”
Harvard could also look to precedent set in a 1992 scandal at the U.S. Naval Academy in which students in an electrical engineering class illicitly distributed an advance copy of an exam.
The Academy, which also has a longstanding honor code, conducted a 16-month investigation into 125 students that ended in the expulsion of 24 midshipmen from the school. Sixty-two others found guilty of violations of the school’s honor code lost certain privileges, including access to certain areas of school grounds.
Expelled students were not required to repay the school for their education and were allowed to finish their spring courses, but did not receive degrees from the Academy.
Six of the expelled midshipmen were also football players at the academy.
Another cheating scandal at Dartmouth College suggests that strength of evidence may also be a factor in determining how Harvard will proceed with the Government 1310 case.
In 2000, Dartmouth investigated 63 undergraduates after a visiting computer science professor accused students of cheating on a homework assignment by consulting with teaching assistants or looking at answers accidently posted on the course website. But Dartmouth’s honor board dropped all charges after it determined that there was not enough evidence to distinguish cheaters from students who misunderstood the assignment’s instructions.
Bloomfield, the physics professor at Virginia, said that almost invariably in cheating scandals, it becomes unclear where exactly the guilt lies. The investigation process often casts negative light on the professor and the university, alongside the guilty students.
“The mud that flies around with this stuff splatters everybody,” Bloomfield said. “You can’t tell who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month’s two sexual assaults, the first reported cases of stranger rape on the Harvard campus in 12 years, loomed over this academic year’s move-in.
For incoming freshmen, notifications of the assaults were among the first e-mails sent to their Harvard University addresses. An e-mail from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds came just six days before freshman move-in.
The first incident occurred on Aug. 10 in the Harvard Yard at 3:10 a.m. and the second was four days later on Aug. 14 near Oxford and Kirkland Streets. After each of these occurrences, the Harvard University Police Department sent out campus alerts, warning students to be mindful of their surroundings and not to walk alone at night.
Stranger rape, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, involves a perpetrator unknown to the victim.
According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, an average of four acquaintance sexual assaults are reported to the department each year.
Yet several freshmen said they were not overly concerned by the alerts, explaining security concerns are to be expected in an urban environment.
“I didn’t feel worried because you will always run across these types of issues living in a city,” said Olivia Moseley ’16. “I feel really safe in the Yard.”
As in previous years, freshmen were required to attend Sex Signals, an educational performance, and attend a gender-segregated discussion run by the Office of Sexual Assault and Rape Prevention.
Some upperclassmen, however, found the assaults alarming, saying that they plan to alter their daily routines.
“A lot of people don’t realize how dangerous the Yard can be, especially late at night,” said Corinne E. Wee ’13. “In the dark, there are a lot of places to hide.”
“I don’t think I would walk alone as late as I used too,” she added.
Claire D. Stolz ‘15, a Cabot House resident, said that she found news of the second assault particularly jarring.
“I was pretty disturbed by news that [rape] had happened again so close to the beginning of the school year, especially since I live in the Quad,” she said.
Stolz said she now makes more of an effort to walk in groups and has discouraged her roommate from running late at night.
Victoria Zhuang ‘15, also a Quad resident, said the news cemented her decision to get a bike in order to avoid feeling “vulnerable.” Zhuang also prefers to walk with at least one friend after dusk, noting that she asked a friend to come get her from Shaws because she did not want to walk home alone in the darkness.
“I feel like I should be more on my guard,” she said.
Both Stolz and Zhuang said that they thought vigilance was important in maintaining safety.
“You always have to be careful,” Stolz said. “You don’t think it could be you, but it could be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The room of Kathryn C. Reed ’13 is a daily reminder of why she will attempt to run 100 miles on a treadmill between Sept. 9 and Sept. 15.
The Tanzanian fabrics, baskets, and carvings, along with photographs from her travels, are keepsakes that remind her of the people she taught about HIV for the past two summers. Her 100-mile run is a means to raise money for further HIV education in the African nation, where she first travelled last summer as a volunteer with Support for International Change.
Reed, a Crimson Magazine chair, is soliciting pledges for every mile she runs to raise money for everything from condoms and soap to HIV testing and health workers’ salaries. Donations have already exceeded $500, a sum she hopes to double, and her efforts will overlap with fundraising efforts in Tanzania, where SIC staff are planning to run a 5K on Sept. 9.
“She’s leading the charge,” said Teresa A. Skelly ’14, a fellow SIC volunteer who will also be working on fundraising this fall. “She made us all want to come back.”
SIC enlists volunteers from the United States and England to teach about HIV in Tanzanian communities in collaboration with local teaching partners. A sociology concentrator, Reed had no science background but had taken Swahili to fulfill her language requirement and so that she could travel to Africa.
With SIC, Reed taught audiences of all ages about the basic science behind the virus, helped dispel myths about HIV transmission, and encouraged condom use. Two of the biggest misconceptions are that condoms and everyday interactions like shaking hands spread HIV, she said.
“A lot of people will say that when you leave a condom to dry in the sun, you can see the worms,” Reed said. “[But that] is just the lubricant drying.”
There is still a lot of stigma associated with the disease, according to Reed, and many people believe that those who test positive for the virus are only trying spread HIV to others.
Reed said she hopes to average about 15 miles a day, distributed between two to three running sessions, in order to repeat the 100-mile feat she first performed last J-term. She sees the challenge as a natural way to support a place she repeatedly said feels like “home.”
One of her mantras is a Swahili saying that translates roughly to, “Slow slow is the way to go, hurry hurry has no blessing.”
“I think it many ways these runs will be like what we’re doing in Tanzania to fight HIV,” she said. “You don’t end HIV in a single awareness campaign, and I’m not going to complete 100 miles in a single run.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Opening Days serve as a chance for carefree socializing before classes start,  undergraduates took up some of life’s graver matters—morality, ethics, and religion—on Sunday.
On Sunday, student groups Harvard College Faith and Action and Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics hosted a “Good without God?” discussion. Panelists debated whether morality and ethics originate from the Christian God or from human reason.
HCHAA President Elliot A. Wilson ’15 introduced the group with a short speech that got the audience laughing with a number of puns before emphasizing the importance of mutual respect.
“Both of our groups reject a model of tolerance that merely says, ‘We acknowledge your right to be wrong,’” Wilson said. “If that alone is tolerance, devoid of a commitment to mutual respect, devoid of compassion and friendship, one which does not enable us enough to effectively talk about our differences, then tolerance isn’t enough.”
One HCFA panelist laid out an argument that ethics were rooted in the principles of Christianity.
“Our goal in this debate is to present an affirmative case for Christian ethics, which is based on God’s great love and compassion for us, specifically revealed in Jesus Christ,” said Corinne Tu ’13.
She also argued that God’s “purpose” is essential to knowing the morality of our decisions.
“The concept of ‘purpose’ is necessary to legitimately evaluate the goodness of something. ‘Purpose’ allows us to determine if something is good or bad,” she said.
Melanie J. Rucinski ’15, the co-vice president of HCHAA, countered by arguing that ethics and morality are based on reason and rational thinking. She brought up utilitarian philosophy, anethical view which prioritizes achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of people.
“Our standard is the utilitarian standard, which we believe results from looking at psychological facts about the human brain and then applying reason to those facts and trying to use reason to bring the way that we make decisions now to a higher end,” Rucinski said.
After an hour, the debate transitioned to a question and answer session, during which several students asked debaters about the two sides’ ideological differences.
“Most of us have a sense of right and wrong,” said Otey, when asked why morality is important to discuss. “Asking the question ‘Why is that the case?’ is important for everyday decision making.”

This semester, students are being provided with new emergency cards which aggregate the contact information for multiple resources in one place.
The cards, designed to fit in a wallet or purse, are the product of an effort led by the Undergraduate Council in conjunction with the Office of Student Life. They provide quick access to contact information for emergency services, transportation services, peer counseling groups, and school offices. The cards also offer advice for staying safe while walking at night.
The Undergraduate Council hopes “to promote better awareness of safety resources on campus,” according to a statement on the UC website.
Michael C. George ’14, the UC’s Student Life Committee Chair and a Crimson editor, came up with the idea for the cards last fall after seeing a Shuttleboy card for the Harvard shuttle network.
“A lot of these cards actually already exist independently,” said George. “Alcohol and Drug Services has a card. The shuttle has a card. [University Health Services] has a card.  But 99 percent of students are not going to be motivated enough to pick them all up in different offices.”
Organizations and offices listed on the cards include the Harvard University Police Department, the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center, Harvard shuttles, the evening van service, walking escorts, Peer Contraceptive Counselors, Room 13 peer counseling, the student mental health liaison program Harvard Smiles, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
Meghan J. Smith '13, co-president of Harvard Smiles, hopes the new cards make students more familiar with on-campus resources.
“They are a great idea,” said Smith. “We already give out little red cards that have similar information, but one of our goals is to reach all of the student body, not just freshmen, and this is one way to reach out to everyone.”
The emergency cards are being released just one month after two stranger rapes were reported on Harvard’s campus. Although the cards were planned last year, the two recent assaults emphasize the importance of the cards, George said.
“For freshman moving in, many of them are worried and unsure of what they should do on campus,” said George. “Getting that information to them within days of arriving on campus is really important.”
Upperclassmen received their cards with their room keys, while freshmen received the cards from proctors during entryway meetings.
Replacements can be found at the OSL, and a printable version of the card can be found on the OSL website, according to George.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A yellow and red Quincy House crest tacked onto the brick exterior of Hampden Hall signifies the building’s new use as one of three swing spaces which will house 179 students while Old Quincy undergoes a complete renovation this academic year.
Students who moved into the buildings this week said that apart from small bedrooms and traffic noise from the streets, they have so far enjoyed their apartment-style housing and their new home’s proximity to classes.
“Who gets to live on Mass. Ave. right outside Harvard Yard without paying a fortune?” Quincy House Committee Co-Chair Scott J. Yim ’13 said.
Yim, who has toured all the swing housing, said the buildings have beautiful common spaces complete with flat screen televisions and pool tables.
“Swing spaces are much better than I expected,” he said. “Harvard and Quincy House have put in a lot of effort to make House life great regardless of where you are physically.”
Joy C. Ming ’15 lives in a quad in Ridgely Hall, another swing space at 65 Mt. Auburn St., with two bedrooms, one common room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. Ming said her suite is not as spacious as her room in Grays last year, but it is “really homey because it has an apartment feel.”
Katherine M. Kulik ’15, who also lives in Ridgely Hall with two roommates, said her favorite parts of the room are the bathtub and the kitchen. She said she and her roommates have already made plans to cook a nice dinner for friends visiting from out of town next weekend.
“It will also be nice to have milk and cereal in the kitchen for a quick breakfast when I’m running late in the morning,” she said.
However, Kulik said the apartment is not without flaws. She said that the closets have no doors and the common room is hexagonal, which makes it difficult to arrange furniture.
“But it definitely adds character to the space,” she said.
Though the majority of students living in swing spaces are sophomores, there are some upperclassmen—32 juniors and 15 seniors—who opted to live in these apartment-style buildings, according to Harvard College Facebook.
Kevin O. Orfield ’13 said he decided to live in Hampden Hall, located next to the Grolier Poetry Shop at 8 Plympton St., after learning the rooms would have kitchens.
“It would be convenient to be able to make something when I am hungry at night and the dining hall is closed,” he said.
Though Orfield said sharing a bedroom is not ideal, he still prefers to have his own kitchen and live in a prime location.
But Kaishuo Chen ’14 was placed in swing space during the lottery last spring because all of the rooms in New Quincy had been claimed by the time he chose.
Chen said he had a hard time falling asleep last night because of the noise from the street, but he said he likes the building’s proximity to Widener and Lamont libraries.
Along with Hampden Hall and Ridgely Hall, Fairfax Hall, at 1306 Mass. Ave., will serve as the third swing space building. Next year, these three buildings will house the residents of Leverett’s McKinlock Hall. When Dunster House is renovated during the 2014-15 academic year, the buildings will again be used, in addition to the larger space at 1201 Mass. Ave that currently houses the Inn at Harvard, as swing housing.
This year, Quincy residents are spread out among five buildings, including New Quincy and DeWolfe.
Creating an integrated House community as construction continues on Old Quincy has been a priority for both the College administration and Quincy House leaders.
Yim said Quincy HoCo has planned several events throughout the year to welcome incoming sophomores. For example, he said that HoCo plans to invest more money in existing programs such as “Penguin Pubs” and “Big Penguin, Little Penguin,” which pairs each sophomore with an upperclassman in the House.
“When big penguins are close to little penguins, they become a great penguin family,” Yim said, adding that while coming to the House for events is important, it is equally necessary to make sure they feel welcomed by upperclassmen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a stalwart defensive effort for much of the game, the Harvard field hockey team ultimately succumbed to constant pressure from Sacred Heart, falling, 2-1, in double-overtime to the Pioneers on Monday at Jordan Field.
 
Filling in for co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos, junior goalie Jenn Hatfield made 15 saves, including seven in the first overtime period, but she could not keep out the final shot of the game, a pinpoint effort into the bottom right corner converted by Sacred Heart’s Liz Bergman off of a penalty corner.
 
“They were looking to attack the entire game, and our defense was very aware,” Hatfield said. “It speaks to the heart of our team that we could make such great recoveries even when we were dead tired in overtime.”
The Pioneers’ attacking initiative was evident in their 30-8 advantage in shots and 15-8 edge in penalty corners. Yet it looked as if the Crimson’s staunch defending, paired with an early second-half goal from junior back Caroline McNeil, would be enough to sneak out a victory.
 
The teams played to a scoreless stalemate in the first half, though Sacred Heart outshot Harvard, 20-6, and possessed the ball for large chunks of time on the attack.
 
But the Crimson opened the scoring six minutes into the second half after a positive stretch of offensive play. Sophomore Sydney Jenkins, whose speed bothered the Pioneers’ defenders on a number of occasions, received the ball after making a run down the left flank and darted into the circle between two defenders before finally winning a penalty corner. On the ensuing corner, junior Caitlin Rea dropped a nifty back pass to a wide open McNeill, who slapped the ball past Sacred Heart goalkeeper Mary Altepeter for a 1-0 lead.
 
But with five minutes remaining, the Pioneers’ sustained offensive effort finally paid off. Sacred Heart’s Lindsay Kasten found an empty pocket of space in the middle of the Harvard circle, and though Hatfield saved her initial effort, Kasten chipped her own rebound past the Crimson goalie to even the score and force the extra session.
 
In the first overtime, the Pioneers were decidedly the more attacking team, but Hatfield was again ready, at one point recording saves on three consecutive penalty corners. Harvard had two strong goal-scoring opportunities of its own; twice, the Crimson had a two-on-one opportunity on the attack, but the first was cancelled out by a sliding save from Altepeter, and the second was erased by a mishandled pass.
 
“Mainly, our attacking aim is to do ‘two v. ones’ up the pitch and kind of eliminate their defenders one by one, and we’ve got some amazing speed with Sydney, Noel [Painter], and Cat [McDonald] all pushing forward,” Rea said. “I think by overtime, our legs were getting a bit tired, but we kept pushing.”
 
The second overtime saw only one shot from both teams—Bergman’s winning effort with 1:17 remaining.
 
“We kept on pushing right to the end; we were really after that goal at the very end, and we put it all out there on the pitch,” Rea said. “At the end, it’s kind of sad when we lose, but we realized we were still getting shots off, and we weren’t letting them walk all over us.”
 
Hatfield’s start in goal in place of Tassopoulos, a three-year starter and two-time All-Ivy selection, came as something of a surprise, but coach Tjerk van Herwaarden made it clear that the move was simply designed to get the most out of both players.
 
“Both goalkeepers have done tremendous work the entire preseason,” van Herwaarden said. “Jenn Hatfield has worked extremely hard in the preseason. I’m a firm believer that goalkeepers can push each other, so this is not a decision based on how Cynthia played, because she played a very good game on Saturday.”
 
Van Herwaarden said that the rotation of the two will not continue the whole season, and he will “make a final decision at some point” as to who will start in goal moving forward.
 
More pressing for Harvard is its difficulty putting the ball in the back of the net. In nearly 170 minutes of play this year, the Crimson has managed only two goals and, according to van Herwaarden, has lacked the finishing touch in front of goal, something that must be remedied if Harvard is to have success in the Ivy season.
 
“That’s where we definitely have to improve,” van Herwaarden said. “We have a sustained buildup that works from the 25 to the circle, and getting more effective in the circle is our main focus in the next couple of weeks.”
