“Bark”, Lorrie Moore’s first short story collection in 15 years, sets out to explore themes of loss, decay, impermanence, and the absurdities of contemporary American life. Unfortunately, the collection is unable to accomplish these ends without descending into its own form of absurdity—an expanse of self-conscious irony, uninspired metaphors, and general narrative aimlessness.
 
The stories within “Bark” contain just about every form of romantic unhappiness imaginable. Moore describes characters who are recently divorced, on the brink of divorce, and still recovering after nine long years of divorce. There is the once-young couple who still can't make ends meet and the older couple who, after coveting each other for years, have their triumphant rendezvous cut short. Scattered among their stories are reflections on the seminal events of 21st century America: 9/11, the Iraq war, Abu Ghraib, Michael Jackson's death, Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Yet despite the familiarity of the characters' situations, despite their all-too-human vulnerabilities, the characters themselves remain persistently unlikeable and remote. In “Paper Losses,” Kit says of her soon-to-be-ex-husband, “He seemed to have turned into some sort of space alien,” a description that rings true for most of Moore's characters. While their petulant internal monologues may be somewhat realistic, sustained exposure stifles any nascent empathy.
 
To compound the problem, Moore's stories tend to be underdeveloped. As characters are introduced and the premise established, multifarious details promise an engaging tale, but ultimately all of this is left behind as the stories trail off without ever reaching real conclusions. In “The Juniper Tree,” three women offer artistic tokens to the ghost of a recently deceased friend and briefly remember a last dinner together. In “Subject to Search,” a government consultant ponders the events at Abu Ghraib as he tells his lover he must return to the U.S. to deal with the consequences. Yet these potentially captivating moments ultimately seem directionless, untethered by any sense of beginning of end.
 
“Wings” and “Debarking,” the two longest stories, which together account for nearly half of the collection's page count, manage somewhat to escape these issues. The characters, although still not quite multidimensional, are more thoroughly realized. The plot develops substantially, rather than descending into rumination and speculation. Yet after the initial set-up, the stories are still lamentably predictable. Do the dating divorcés find happiness together? No. Does the financially and romantically struggling couple in their late thirties manage to restart the failed musical career of their youth? No. Moore's style makes it abundantly clear that to hope for a happy ending would be futile.
 
Often, one gets the impression that Moore is trying too hard. Nearly every story suffers from heavy-handed imagery—death and decay forced into parallel with the characters’ diminishing prospects. In “Paper Losses,” Kit and her family take a pre-divorce Caribbean vacation. The resort staff keep newly hatched sea turtles in order to show them to the guests, but the turtles begin to die in the daytime heat and are snatched up by predators even as they are released into the waves. KC, the youngish protagonist of “Wings”, swims in a lake of dead fish with the lecherous old man she has befriended as a distraction from her failing love life.
 
“Bark” is also rife with self-conscious irony and absurdity. KC spends much of her time walking the dog she has named “Cat” (a choice she frequently has to explain), yet it's unclear what that particular detail adds to the story. In “Thank You for Having Me,” a motorcycle gang appears at a wedding unexpectedly and spouts incoherent, pseudo-philosophical phrases like “It's the flickering quantum zone of gun and none, got and not,” only to discover that they are looking for a different bride. The incident certainly fits into Moore's display of the absurdity of life, but the same purpose is already served with more subtlety by the groom's beaded, ear of corn-shaped tie.
 
“Foes” is the sole story not plagued by these pervasive flaws. Its protagonist—a mediocre biographer visiting DC to serve as the token writer at a magazine's fundraising dinner—is actually likeable and apparently normal. His marriage is happy but not absolutely perfect, and, aside from titling his work on George Washington “Man on a Quarter, Man on a Horse,” he isn't too caught up in his own pretensions. Dialogue drives the story and saves it from the muddled reflection, grating soliloquy and overdone metaphor that plague much of “Bark.” Despite its brevity, the narrative builds deftly to a startling and emotionally intense conclusion. Unlike most of the collection, “Foes” makes the tragedies of contemporary America real and immediate.
 
For the other stories, there is one source of redemption: Moore's sense of humor. While much of “Bark” is characterized by a forced sense of profundity, Moore also offers pithy observations and dry wit. In “Debarking,” a man gets his house repainted on the eve of the Iraq war with an amusing result: “Now in his front lawn he had two signs: WAR IS NOT THE ANSWER in blue, and on the other side, in black and yellow, JENKINS PAINTING IS THE ANSWER.”
 
Alone, each of Moore's stories would be intriguing—if not strictly enjoyable, then at least thought-provoking. Together, however, they become oppressive, a litany of unhappy situations, off-putting characters, and overdone metaphor that rarely seems to be going anywhere. The frustrations of contemporary middle class American life, familiar to Moore's readership, provide excellent narrative fodder. Unfortunately, the elaborate melancholy Moore constructs around these troubles casts them as some of the world's great tragedies, making “Bark” seem a rather privileged, self-centered lament.

 When immersed in a certain brand of modern writing, it is easy to forget that other groups of people exist besides dead-end suburban teen druggies and slightly less dead-end artsy Brooklynite 20-somethings (who may or may not be druggies). Adam Wilson’s new short story collection, “What’s Important Is Feeling,” is a prime example of this particular style. The older, more put-together characters resemble those of HBO’s “Girls”—they are constantly culturally referential, well-educated, likely on the road to relative financial security despite occasional discomfort with the idea, and alternately dramatically emotive and apathetic. Class does not characterize his younger set; some are wealthy, but others are lower middle class. They are all between 15 and 18, midway through discovering sex, dependent on drugs and alcohol, and dissatisfied with their parents and school. Yet the primary issue with the collection is not Wilson’s lack of diversity in his protagonists or even that he uses two groups that are rapidly becoming cultural stereotypes. “What’s Important is Feeling” stumbles as a result of Wilson’s failure to put his protagonists in compelling physical and philosophical settings.
  In “Sluts At Heart,” the most effective story in the collection, Wilson breaks out of his 21st-century aesthetic and sets the tale’s brief rumination on the death of a friend in 1992. A Brooklyn 20-something (surprise!) preoccupied, like many of the time, with whether Fat or Hot Elvis would grace the National Stamp, travels back home to Boston to visit a high school friend who has been diagnosed with cancer. The Elvis motif, which figures prominently in Wilson’s deconstruction of his protagonist’s existential angst, is powerful and avoids heavy-handedness. Wilson’s ability to capture the language  (“Yo,” for one) and mood (extreme unease in the wake of the Rodney King riots and the Gulf War) of the moment with efficiency and subtlety suggests a far larger cultural range than that on display in most of the book. 
  Wilson’s other deviations from his favorite aesthetics make up the most illuminating sections of his work. In “Things I Had, for S.R.,” Wilson shifts his setting to South Florida and focuses on an awkward Jewish teen, Andrew. The piece describes his first time smoking weed, rampant sexual frustration, and garbled relationship with his Alzheimer’s-afflicted grandfather, who believes his grandson to be his dead partner. Wilson provides commentary on the cultural divide between the largely Latino high school population and Andrew, who is sent to the “different counselor for Jewish kids, a social worker named Javier whose office was lined with science-fiction books and posters from ‘Star Trek’ conventions.” Wilson, who doesn’t talk about race or class much outside of “Things I Had,” does so with humor and tact, which makes it all the more frustrating that he doesn’t cast a wider net of experience throughout the collection.
  Those stories set in a chain store-riddled East Coast suburban hell or in apartments in Greenpoint or Back Bay are repetitive and often self-indulgent. The number of paragraphs Wilson spends describing hours of lazy pizza microwaving, TV watching, smoking, parental alienation, and general lack of direction is astounding.The suburban teen stories are at least given a jolt out of the living room by the repeated presence of life-threatening disease. While Wilson writes about grief extremely well—his stoned protagonists showcase varied emotional responses and dissonances after their wrenching losses—the juxtaposition wears thin quickly. With stories as short as Wilson’s, constantly devastating events evoke numbness more than legitimate emotion. The characters are simply too anonymous (particularly those who are dead or dying) to buoy such big feelings.
  The stories that focus on the older characters don’t have as much of a death obsession. Instead, they are almost always revolve around sex. Wilson isn’t especially graphic in his descriptions; he imbues the stories with a provocative conversational frankness about casual sex and the blasé “millennial” attitude towards deeper connection. Once again, however, the repetition and brevity of the various relationships and stunted bedroom interactions lead to boredom. Wilson tries to mix it up, writing unconvincingly as a young career woman in one story and bizarrely incorporating a lobster fetish into a semi-afloat addict’s love life in another. In the latter story, “Milligrams,” he even plays with form and writes the piece as a numbered list. Most of the shifts, however, come off as attempts to cover up the similarities between the pieces.
  “What’s Important Is Feeling” is Wilson’s first short story collection and second published book. He is funny, good with dialogue, and astonishingly efficient with prose. Although his ideas here are overused, his flirtations with racial, geographical, and historical diversity are absorbing. If Wilson manages in his next work either to bring new ideas to his two go-to settings or to embrace new and wackier ones fully, he may create something thoroughly beautiful.

 Remember that one time you happened to stumble into that special someone at your favorite bar, which led to a few sweet nothings and a spontaneous midnight rendezvous? Also remember the awkward morning that ensued? In “About Last Night,” a hilariously frank and modern remake of the 1986 movie by the same title, director Steve Pink explores whether a hot new flame can last more than a night. Set apart by witty dialogue and relatable personalities, “About Last Night” follows the journey of two couples as they attempt to bring newfound love into their everyday lives.
Every single on the search needs a bona fide wing person, and Bernie (Kevin Hart) and Joan (Regina Hall) are just that, the guides to the game for their “boring” best friends Danny (Michael Ealy) and Debbie (Joy Bryant), respectively. As Danny’s feelings for Debbie quickly progress and one unexpected night turns to living together, Bernie is adamant about holding onto his bachelorhood. Bernie declares to Danny, “You’ve been banished to the world of matching costumes. I don’t know anything more emasculating.” Yet Bernie also finds himself drawn to Joan, who wants to be the girlfriend but, like Bernie, doesn’t want to be the one to say, “I love you” first. Amidst career pressures and lingering pasts, these four weave through the temptations of singledom and discover a different side of themselves in a life of commitment.
  Delivering salacious humor with confidence and ease, Hart is truly in his element. His playful, joking nature fits seamlessly into the clever banter between friends and lovers. Throughout the film, the dialogues between characters flow naturally and allows for the development of believable relationships. It also allows for a storyline that doesn’t seem contrived despite predictable romantic comedy elements such as the return of the ex and the breakup to make up. Though not complex performances, the four leads present their respective characters in a way that is far from one-dimensional. Hall brings a light-hearted, jovial spirit to the catty and tarty Joan, Bryant brings tenderness to the passively demanding Debbie, and Ealy brings an honest essence to the endearing but slightly misguided Danny.
  The cinematography is warm and inviting, allowing for the storyline to unfold in a natural way. The film introduces chapters of the story as seasons—from “About Fall” to “About Spring”— creating a fluid passage of time. This gives the characters space to grow, as their development is projected as a journey in time. Each scene is full of dialogue, creating liveliness throughout the film. Conversations between Joan and Debbie and Bernie and Danny are woven together so that the characters complete each other’s sentences in adjacent scenes, illustrating the comparative perspectives on love that men and women hold. The film’s narrative is fully focused on the four leads, enabling the audience to gain intimate knowledge about the feelings, thoughts, and perspectives of each character. Furthermore, the score throughout the film enhances the emotions and tensions between the characters within each scene. With a selection that includes the works of John Legend and Bruno Mars, this score sets an undercurrent of romance and soft love throughout the film.
  “About Last Night” presents a real, modern depiction of not just finding but sustaining love in today’s busybody, social media-driven world. This romantic comedy may not be compelling, but its relatable storyline embraces the awkwardness of real-world romance. It manages to be youthful and hopeful without being trite and makes a compelling argument that “an honest relationship is the most freeing thing in the world.”

After 2012’s lackluster “Total Recall” reboot, the notion of yet another remake of a Paul Verhoeven movie may elicit more groaning than excitement from many moviegoers. But passing judgment on a movie too quickly can lead someone to miss out on things that are worth seeing. For instance, you’d have been forgiven for thinking at first that the original “RoboCop,” a movie about a cybernetic lawman patrolling the mean streets of Detroit, seemed silly. But by passing over the film, you’d miss an exciting and relatively self-aware meditation on the military-industrial complex and the price society pays for coming down hard on crime. By the same token, action movie fans may want to give this new “RoboCop” a chance. While it has some weaknesses in plotting and pacing, José Padilha’s “RoboCop” remake is a decent action flick that makes a respectable effort to take the RoboCop concept in new directions.
The overall premise of the new “Robocop” will be fairly familiar to those who remember the originals. Police detective Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is critically injured by a car bomb while attempting to investigate corruption in his department. In Murphy’s personal tragedy, Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton), CEO of the multinational arms manufacturer OmniCorp, sees a PR opportunity, so he convinces Murphy’s wife (Abbie Cornish) to allow OmniCorp to restore the wounded officer to health with experimental prosthetics. Since it may be her husband’s only chance to walk again, she agrees, and a team of OmniCorp researchers place the few functioning parts of the detective into a powerful, robotic body. Thus, RoboCop is born and takes to the streets of Detroit to mete out justice, eventually confronting the criminals who made the attempt on his life.
  RoboCop is generally a good-looking movie. The years since the release of the 1987 original have seen great advancements in special effects, and it shows from the opening scene featuring new and improved CGI versions of Omnicorp’s colossal Enforcement Droids. In addition, the audience is treated to some stylish action by cinematographer Lula Carvalho. In one memorable combat sequence, RoboCop takes on a gang of heavily armed thugs in a dark warehouse with few sources of light apart from muzzle flashes and the ominous red glow of his visor. Unfortunately, the action feels unevenly spaced throughout the film; the first half of the movie could have used a bit more excitement, while the second half felt a bit too cluttered with it to be fully coherent at all times.
  Acting isn’t necessarily the centerpiece of an action-oriented movie like this one, but several performances in the film deserve praise. Kinnaman as Alex Murphy remains largely stoic throughout the film but may pull a few heartstrings in the scene in which he first sees his new body. Samuel L. Jackson makes a humorous performance as Pat Novak, a pastiche of right-wing TV commentators and a fervent supporter of Omnicorp’s business practices on the airwaves. The only lead actor who disappoints is Michael Keaton, whose portrayal of Sellars is fairly unremarkable and largely overshadowed by other actors throughout the movie.
  To its credit, the new “RoboCop” avoids simply retreading the arc of its predecessor’s plot by exploring characters and themes that the original did not. For instance, this film fleshes out Murphy’s relationship with his family and explores how the protagonist’s wife and son might cope with having the beloved father of their family return to them a changed man. It also does a good job at making the stakes of the issues at hand feel grander in scope by framing Omnicorp’s RoboCop initiative as a pilot program for a potential nationally distributed line of law enforcement robots.
However, comparing this “RoboCop” to the 1987 version also accentuates a few weaknesses of the new film’s narrative. While the original movie excelled at constructing a bleak version of Detroit so violent and lawless as to be almost inhospitable to life, the Detroit of this “RoboCop” film doesn’t seem more exceptionally dangerous than any contemporary metropolis. This makes OmniCorp and its supporters seem less like they’re operating in a morally gray area by offering an extreme solution to city’s problems and more like plain old villains capitalizing on Detroit’s unfounded fears, effectively washing away some of the ethical ambiguity that made the first film thought-provoking.  The plot of the new movie has a few shortcomings compared to that of its originator as well. The original film featured a much more memorable collection of villains, and some people may consider the ending to the new film to be somewhat of a RoboCop-out compared to that of the original.
“RoboCop” isn’t an outstanding picture, but it does successfully distinguish itself from its ancestors and deliver some good laughs and solid action. With the addition of this new film, the RoboCop franchise has come to resemble its own premise: brought back from the dead and outfitted with some of the most impressive bells and whistles modern technology can afford, it still struggles to reclaim the heart of its previous life.

On the morning of Feb. 13, architecture students at the Graduate School of Design could be found not drafting blueprints or discussing neoclassical façades, but rather painting black-and-white closeups of their own faces. Course VIS-02448, also known as “Landscape as Painting,” initially seems like an oddity in such a setting. Indeed, one might wonder where a course billing itself as the study of “emotional perception, bodily experience, and metaphoric interpretation of landscape” fits into the framework of an architect’s education. Yet GSD students and faculty explain that the technique, creativity, and vision the class demands apply equally well to architecture as to art.
 
Visiting artist Monique F. Crine was present to help lead a workshop for students to create a black-and-white self-portrait, the first major project of the semester-long course. The class is regularly taught by Professor Ewa J. Harabasz, an artist whose stunning depictions of social conflict and personal tragedy have brought her acclaim across three continents. Although her works are notable for their complexity, she says that her goals in teaching the class are quite simple. “The architect’s first task is to draw,” Harabasz says. “When I taught at Cornell University, I did art and architecture. The students from architecture could take classes from art, and it was mixed together…. But here it’s only architecture and design, and this is the first problem. The architects don’t have contact with art.” The rise of computers has deepened this divide; Harabasz explains that there are “completely different ways of thinking” involved in hand drawing and computer design.
 
She posits that these differences in thinking lead to differences in creativity––that once a student learns to express thoughts through drawing, regardless of talent, their mind becomes more artistic and productive. Part of this learning process includes inviting other artists, like Crine, to come and present to the class.
 
Crine, a photographer and painter based in Denver, creates intensely personal portraits based on photo references. “Monique has a specific technique for painting large-scale paintings with only black and white,” Harabasz says. “You can’t ignore this technique…. We have a black-and-white exercise right now, so I bring the best [artist].” After explaining her own work, Crine guided students through the process of transferring photographs of themselves onto a canvas, where they began to flesh out the images with subtly different blacks and grays.
Why this focus on black-and-white art? One reason is its simplicity, Crine explains; black and white allows students to focus on tone, value, dimensionality, and volume without worrying about the added complexity of color. Another reason is its reliance on an understanding of light and shadow within spaces, a skill surely useful to architecture students. Harabasz adds that there has been a trend towards muted colors in art recently: “Look at what artists are actually painting – they are all painting with less color. A lot of portraits, landscapes, even the news is black and white.” Harabasz sees this as a chance to give her students cutting-edge skills that they will be able to use right away.
 
Proficiency with black-and-white media is only one of the skills students are taking away from the workshop, however. “It gives you the opportunity to think about things on a more human scale, and that’s a valuable lesson,” says Miree Song, a third-year student in the Landscape Architecture master’s program. “Everything that we work with in the Landscape Architecture Department is very ephemeral…. What [Monique]’s doing is to take a still shot and paint it, which gives it more temporality, and I think that’s what we’re trying to achieve.” Other students identified the careful gridding and drafting involved in the image-transfer process as tasks which, although almost always delegated to a computer, are nonetheless important for architects to master.
 
But perhaps the most important lesson transmitted by the workshop is that of self-confidence. “[Monique] is young, communicative, an excellent person,” Harabasz says. “She’s definitely bringing so much energy and she can give [the students] that strength so that they can go and believe in themselves and what they do.”
 
If one thing is certain, it’s that Harabasz believes in her students’ work. “They are such smart students, and each of them can make unique, beautiful paintings. I wish for all the students in GSD that they have an excellent experience with my classes, that they enjoy it and not only enjoy it but also learn and use it in their own work.”

The stars in the night sky are the only witnesses as Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe) enters a dark room. He has an important task ahead: his cat-and-mouse game with Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) has reached a road bump. As a demon, he needs permission to enter restricted territory to capture the man. Pearly is a dangerous killer, and as he addresses his leader, the tension is palpable. Enter Will Smith as Lucifer donning a blazer and t-shirt—a fine outfit on him but out of place against an early 20th-century backdrop. The moment is laughable, a blip in casting choices. But Will Smith’s appearance represents the exact problem with “Winter’s Tale”: potential ruined.
 
The film has the essential ingredients to be excellent. Its source is Mark Helprin’s novel of the same name, a novel so powerful it made one New York Times reviewer nervous about inadequately representing its beauty. The adaptation boasts a screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman, who won an Academy Award for his script for “A Beautiful Mind”, and sports a critically acclaimed cast. The film’s recipe almost guarantees two hours of emotion and action, yet the product is less than appetizing.
 
Within the first minute, shimmering stars greet the audience, hinting at two hours of beautiful imagery. This is one aspect of the film that does not fail. The cinematography is consistent, bringing the setting and characters to life with wintry colors and startling backdrops. As the film progresses, the snow glistens in the countryside. A shining light, resembling diamonds, reappears frequently: as a passerby flips a coin on the street, as a character is introduced, as a thoughtful connection between scenes.
 
As the plot progresses, however, expectations are quickly dashed. The story focuses on Peter Lake, an orphan, thief, and mechanic on the run from gang leader Pearly. While robbing a house, Peter meets and falls in love with heiress Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay). The romance is ill-fated, however, as gangs, sickness, and destiny work to thwart their love. Missing memories, time leaps, reincarnation, and mystical beings take over as the film rushes forward towards a story that’s more than fantasy, more than romance, more than historical drama—a theoretical epic that only elicits disappointment.
 
The issue lies partly in execution. The actors do display talent—Farrell’s eyes mist and tear up when he sees a picture of Beverly, a change that is both subtle and potent. However, the cast fails when it’s together. The leading lovers lack chemistry, and their romance feels colder than the season of interest. When Beverly and Peter first meet, they have an awkward conversation that is meant to be charming, even though Farrell and Findley make it forced. Without passion, their love story becomes disengaging. Other characters are just as disappointing. Initially, Pearly bears resemblance to Crowe’s role as Inspector Javert in “Les Misérables.” The major difference is that while Javert is more than an antagonist, the film characterizes Pearly as just the “bad guy.” One scene suggests more layers behind his character—when Lucifer alludes to Pearly’s complicated feelings for Peter—but this plot element is discarded, resulting in a one-dimensional, forgettable character that squanders Crowe’s talents.
 
The film’s major problem, however, is that it lacks direction and balance. Despite advertising a plot that spans two time periods, the film focuses too long on the past and Peter’s romance with Beverly. Though this story is integral to the second half, it leaves the modern tale rushed. As the characters march towards the climax and resolution, epiphanies are realized in a matter of seconds, and fights are resolved too quickly to be intense. This abruptness inhibits character development and renders them static and uninteresting. The film tries to be too much and ends up becoming too little.
 
As Goldsman’s directorial debut, “Winter’s Tale” disappoints. From the moment the narrator asks, “What if once upon a time there were no stars in the sky?” the film sets itself up as revolutionary and meaningful. Motifs are abundant from the opening scene. The “City of Justice” sign, the stars, the shimmering light—all take on a symbolic role. The issue isn’t the excessiveness, however, but how the ideas become reduced in power by a gradually simplifying plot. By the end, what is left is a cliché story—a tired tale concerning the war between good and evil, a tale concerning a love that defies time, a tale concerning a man and his destiny. 
 
“Magic is everywhere around us,” the narrator says in the first scene. For “Winter’s Tale,” that statement carries truth, but like everything else in the film, the magic is merely a plot device, and a poorly employed one that fails to capture the true enchantment of the source material.

Inspired by the “The Shining,” the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production “In the Dark” seeks to explore violence on both a concrete and abstract level to illustrate how violent actions can simultaneously bring a family closer together and tear it apart. The play centers around two siblings, Eve (Taylor K. Phillips ’15) and Zade (Matthew J. Bialo ’15), who flee to a dark, dangerous forest after seeing their father commit murder; the two become inextricably linked as their reality deteriorates. 
 
The challenges of adapting thematic elements of a film to the stage and the ensuing narrative differences between the two versions is a source of fascination for writer and director Matt S. Kane ’15. “I wanted to see what happens when you take a movie about someone going insane and chasing people and put it into a theatrical play,” Krane says. “Although a play cannot have chase scenes, it can have the fear of someone chasing you and the fear of an environment that starts to come to life.” 
Moreover, the idea of fear, the occult, and mystical are fundamental themes in the plot and serves as catalysts for the play’s multifaceted characters. “I like the different levels Eve goes through. She gets to experience everything really fully without trying to hold anything back. It is interesting to be the skeptical one and to be the one who is allowed to be scared,” Phillips says.
Each character’s experience with fear manifests itself in different ways. Eve must deal with her own mental demons, and this fear clashes with the more logical and grounded character, Zade, whose tough exterior crumbles in the face of instability. Zade’s anxiety about loss of control results in aggression as the two slowly break down.  “My favorite aspect about the part is that he loses control and reacts incredibly violently and ends up channeling his evil father’s personality into his own,” Bialo says.
As the lines between reality and imagination blur, “In the Dark” is bound to be a mind-bender.

“You know, it’s bells. You can’t really play them quietly.” So says Harry W. Hild ’16 of the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers, a small group of students responsible for ringing Lowell House’s bells every Sunday. For over half a century, the society has worked to expand campus-wide knowledge and appreciation of the 17 bronze bells housed in Lowell’s bell tower. This has led the group to travel to Moscow to learn from master bell ringers and to develop a musical repertoire both traditional and modern. 
Lowell House’s original bells were personally given in 1930 to Abbott Lawrence Lowell by his friend Charles Richard Crane, who purchased them at scrap metal prices from the Russian government. After lengthy negotiations, the original bells were returned to the Danilov monastery in Moscow in 2008 and replaced by intricate replicas that mimic the religious icons and inscriptions of the originals. Mother Earth, the largest bell in the collection, weighs over 13 tons and features images of St. Daniel and Alexander Nevsky.
  It takes a great deal of musical talent to ring the bells properly, so every other year, a Russian monk travels to Lowell House to teach the bell ringers new skills. This spring, the Danilov Monastery’s Hierodeacon Roman Ogrzykov will come to conduct a master class for the society, which visited him in Moscow last summer. “We didn’t have the tourist experience,” Hild says. “We got access to places in Russia that most Russians don’t get to see.” Dylan F. Perese ’16, another of member of the society, says the group was given the red carpet treatment by their Russian hosts: “We got to ring the bells in Red Square, right next to the Kremlin…. All the bell towers in Russia were slightly different, but what is the same is the warmth and compassion that we received from each bell ringer.”
  With help from the monks’ teaching, the society has been able to improve their technique and expand their musical selections. While they still maintain the tradition of ringing out Yale’s (usually losing) score from Harvard-Yale on the aptly named Bell of Famine, Pestilence, and Despair, in recent years, the bell ringers have favored more modern tunes. “We can play ‘Call Me Maybe.’ We used to play ‘Bad Romance’ a lot. But I think it’s time to update,” Hild says. Other songs in the bell ringers’ repertoire include “Concerning Hobbits” from “The Lord of the Rings” score, Elton John’s “Crocodile Rock,” and the traditional “Simple Gifts” and “Amazing Grace.” Todd E. Jones ’16, one of the group’s newest ringers, says that he was drawn to the society by one song in particular. “I heard them playing ‘The Battle Hymn of the Republic’ one day, and I thought, ‘I need to get up there.’”
  Though Jones is a resident of Lowell House, membership in the society is open to all undergraduates. Beginning in the fall, prospective bell ringers can start attending bell ringing sessions every Sunday at 1 p.m. and can receive admission into the society if they stick with it until Russian Orthodox Easter. While some river residents may dread hearing the bells’ peals on Sundays, society president Virginia R. Marshall ’15, a Crimson Arts editor, encourages them to give the bells a chance. “People really hate the bells. They’re very loud and it’s hard to make them sound great. But if they could go up there and see [them], their perspective would change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
American playwright and screenwriter Alfred F. Uhry is among a select group of writers to receive an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, and a Tony (of which he has two). His 1987 play “Driving Miss Daisy” received widespread critical acclaim and was adapted into a 1989 film for which he wrote the screenplay. The film went on to garner four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. Uhry recently sat down with The Crimson to talk about the differences between writing for the stage and for the screen and the role of the arts in shaping political discussions.
THC: What was the process of [adapting “Driving Miss Daisy”] for the screen like?
AU: I had a very good director named Bruce Beresford, and he had done plays adapted into movies. So I wrote my script, and he said, “Well, you know what you've done is just retyped your play. And that's very nice, but that's not a movie…. In a movie, you don't have to say as much. You can get by with the look in somebody's eye or the way their mouth might move…. What I would love from you is pages of visual stuff. What it felt like to live in Atlanta then.” So, I wrote about National Geographic magazines piled up on the radiator, sunlight coming through Venetian blinds, what the food was like, what the weather was like…. The screenplay has its own rhythm, and I realized…that a writer is in control of a play, but a director is in control of a movie.
 
THC: How involved were you on set during the making of your movies?
 
AU: I was very involved with “Driving Miss Daisy.” I was lucky; I was there a lot, and they trusted me. Well, a reason was that I had written about a subject that I knew about—Atlanta in the ’40s and ’50s. And they would ask me questions like, "Would Miss Daisy eat fried chicken with her fingers?" and I said, ‘Well yeah,”.... I got [to Atlanta] and Bruce met me and he said, "I have to admit I asked your mother the same thing, and she said you were right." I mean, so they were checking. But on most movies I would rarely be there. I would turn in my script, and they didn't want me.
 
THC: Were there any actors or actresses you thought were particularly good at portraying the characters in the way that you had seen them?
 
AU: Yes. Morgan Freeman played the part in the play [“Driving Miss Daisy”] originally, when it was off-Broadway in a 72-seat theater. He was the original Hoke. He was only 40 years old, but it was remarkable because he played this old man, and he played it with dignity and humor and everything I would have wanted. The first day of rehearsal, he said, "I think you and I knew the same man." He managed—because he wasn't a movie star—to get the film, and he became a movie star. But that was luck; Morgan illuminated that movie.
 
THC: Were there ever points where your vision for a movie really conflicted with that of the director's?
 
AU: Yes. Not in…[“Driving Miss Daisy”], but there were…. There are a lot of cooks involved in making a movie…and the writer's voice is not nearly as well-represented in a film as it is in a play. Of course, the advantages of writing a movie are that you get paid in advance…. In a play you don't get paid in advance, and you're sort of skipping from stone to stone all your life, you know…. Some playwright—I've forgotten who—said, "You can make a killing in the theater, but you can't make a living." In other words, you can have one hit play, maybe two, but there's all those years in between, all that time…. So I was very lucky in that I got into writing screenplays because of my plays, and I did it for 10 or 12 years. It supported me, and I just found that I was spoiled; I liked the theater better.
 
THC: Why did you like the theater better?
 
AU: Because it was me. I like the actuality of knowing it was alive every night, and seeing it in front of an audience, and having the actors take those risks that they took every night. Trying to remember the lines, trying to remember the blocking, what happens if they go up, what happens with that piece of scenery. It's alive. In the movies it's canned. You can be dead and still be really good in a movie, you know.
 
THC: What do you find most rewarding about writing, whether for the screen or for the stage?
 
AU: The most rewarding in the theater is standing at the back of the house and having people react to what you've done. It's really a wonderful, warm feeling. What I love, and what's also really rewarding in the theater, is the rehearsal period…. I've been very lucky with actors who are these talented, committed people, and who spend that period just thinking about how to interpret your work. Recently, “Driving Miss Daisy” was done in Australia by James Earl Jones and Angela Lansbury. Now those are two big, huge theater people, both in their eighties...and they were both being so careful about it…. I mean, going over it with a little microscope. I thought, “My God, these geniuses are devoting all this time to my work.” It's very, very rewarding. In the movies—I hate to sound snobby—it's not that.
 
THC: What are the roles of theater and film in shaping the conversation surrounding highly politicized topics such as racism and religious prejudice?
 AU: I think film and theater play an enormous part in our social conversations. I think the fact that there is such a film—that's successful—as “12 Years A Slave,” is a much better reference to that period of American history than, say, “Gone with the Wind” because it deals with actual things that really happened. It doesn't prettify anything…. I think a film like “American Hustle” is a good artistic representation of the 1970s in this country, and done very artistically. I believe that film, television,…certainly theater, has a lot to do with what we talk about, and I think it shapes a lot of our feelings.

A five-minute wordless vignette is the flimsy explanation “Endless Love” offers for the sudden passion between wealthy and beautiful Georgian high-school grad Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde) and her less wealthy but equally beautiful classmate David Elliot (Alex Pettyfer). The duo, in various states of undress, frolics through fields of wheat, goes to music festivals, and takes bike rides through well-lit forests to the pulsing EDM of Empire of the Sun. No other scenes in the film explain their mutual interests or show them in deep conversation (or even casual discussion). The shallowness of Jade and David’s relationship is emblematic of the absence of the very elements that should theoretically be the film’s mainstays. The movie isn’t sexy or especially sexual, despite Jade’s implied loss of virginity and subsequent “torrid” love affair. It also doesn’t feel contemporary, despite the fact that teenagers are its primary characters. And most egregious of all, the relationships in the film don’t come off as vaguely emotionally honest, even though the character-driven concept demands passionate and organic performances over style and plot.
 
Only some of the blandness of the teenage world created by director Shana Feste and “Gossip Girl” writer Joshua Safran, (whose complicity in the film is especially disappointing given the occasional scandal of his late TV show) can be ascribed to its PG-13 rating. The lack of discussion surrounding the ubiquitous red solo cups, the off-screen cannabis experimentation, and the avoidance of the word “sex” can all be explained away by demographic and MPAA concerns. The seemingly secular Puritanism of Jade’s parents, the ebullient choreographed couples dance routines at Jade’s grad party, the permissive treatment of extreme greed and opulence, and the almost complete avoidance of cultural referentiality (the relatively hip indie-rock soundtrack, smartphones, and isolated mentions of “Hulu” and “Uber” are the sole indications of the 21st century) suggest a more intentional creation of a whitewashed American youth aesthetic.
 
Not since the 1960s “Beach Party” days has a teen movie seemed more detached from the sociocultural realities of the demographic it aims to please. Even the top-grossing high school and college dramas at the height of the Reagan Revolution were more explicit, honest about the awkwardness of sex, and nuanced in their portrayal of class than “Endless Love” is. David spends much of the film trying to win over Jade’s authoritarian father (Bruce Greenwood) by fixing his deceased son’s car (an occasionally present, pandering grief subplot not worth commenting on) and offering plaintive “I just want a good girl to come home to” protestations over mint juleps at the Butterfields’ mansion. The world is analogous in its unreality to that created by Nicholas Sparks in his recent films “The Vow” and “Safe Haven.” The tender age of the protagonists, however, makes the result more unsettling; it’s easy to imagine Sparks’ characters made the decision to enter some sort of planned uber-conservative dystopian village; Jade and David appear far more helplessly entrenched.
 
  The aesthetic on its own, while culturally disturbing, is oddly compelling. The distorted vision of teenage (and adult) communication evokes David Lynch’s slightly off world in “Blue Velvet” and “Twin Peaks.” The difference is that, while Lynch’s world is a creepier and more intense version of reality, Feste and Safran’s is a simpler and more pedestrian illusion. The lack of exposition or emotional explanation in the script probably dooms any possibility of the aesthetic to have any lasting power. To remain interesting, their muted world would need to be populated by kinetic and extremely charismatic performers. Although gorgeous, muscled Pettyfer and waifish Wilde are unable to muster the necessary chemistry or range to lend their performances any sense of depth. Pettyfer is particularly blasé, mumbling through his simplistic dialogue and getting too instantly angry and out of control when Jade’s father, Hugh, begins to uncover his his inevitable tough-guy past.
 
Greenwood, a celebrated character actor, gives the most varied and believable performance in the film. A workaholic and obsessive Brown grad (Jade is enrolled for the Fall), Greenwood twitches, scowls, and glares with increasing anguish as Jade becomes more transfixed on by David, whose collegiate aspirations are put off by his desire to help his auto mechanic father in his shop. After David shows up unannounced at the Butterfield beach house, Hugh takes him in his boat, where the father’s movements become deliberate and his eyes crazed. For a moment, it appears as though Hugh may throw the boy overboard. Although cooler heads prevail, Greenwood’s portrayal of Hugh’s animosity and desire to protect his daughter is creepy and tragic, while Joely Richardson’s performance as Hugh’s repressed ex-writer wife is restrained and, though sometimes too mellow, often moving.
 As the tensions between young lovers and disturbed parents come to a head, however, the unrealistic world and tired lead efforts are increasingly magnified. “Endless Love” is a bizarrely fake trip into an unworthy infatuation.

Simultaneously sweet and perverse, “Smoking Lesson” is a paradox. The play, set to run in the Loeb Ex, depicts the dynamic and drama between three teenage girls–Tare, Mary Kate, and Lisa Ann– and an older man, Tom, whose interaction with the girls sets the stage for the trio’s undoing. 
For director Lelaina E. Vogel ’15, the production presents an opportunity to explore a message that is normally forgotten by Harvard students. “I’m telling a story that is…about a part of the country that a lot of Harvard ignores and a part of ourselves that Harvard students live to ignore,” Vogel says. “Namely, the Midwest and what it means for us to grow up too fast or sometimes grow up not at all.”
The complexity of the production’s thematic underbelly is what attracted the cast and crew to this production. “I think that it’s rare to have a story where two people can come out of it and think, ‘Wow, that is such a tragic story for Tom’ and other people can be like, ‘Wow, that story about Tare really touched me,’” actor Archie I.H. Stonehill ’17 says.
 
“[The plot] is...shifty. It moves very quickly,” Vogel says.
 
Sass agrees. “No one will be bored.”
 
The multifaceted plot goes hand in hand with the complex characters that populate the world of “Smoking Lesson.” “I think for me it’s been really amazing to work on a character whose sort of veering on the edge of being a child and figuring out who she is.” says Juliana N. Sass ’17, who plays Tare. “There’s this supreme confidence that exists in an ironic way because she doesn’t really know what she’s doing.”
 
“Smoking Lesson” looks to be a unique play guaranteed to fascinate and inspire. As Vogel emphasizes, “We [Harvard students] sit on a strange divide where we feel like we have to behave like we’re incredibly mature adults…and what this play shows is that the facade of being perfect and polished and pristine is so false.”

First, do whatever you can to eavesdrop on conversations. Curl your feet up on the pebbled carpet of your stairs at home and listen to the tinkling chatter of adults at dinner. Lie on the carpet and watch your brother’s legs shake up and down as he listens to books on tape. Lean the back of your head against your parents’ bedroom door and hear the whispered urgency of goodness-knows-what. Tell yourself this is normal but feel guilty listening in, like a cicada quietly unsticking herself from an ugly shell.When you encounter poetry in school, don’t pay any attention. Who cares about daffodils and how they feel? Rhyming “trees” with “breeze” and “hills” with “daffodils” should not, in your opinion, be enough to constitute a poem. You prefer not to talk because everyone else has so many things to say and more interesting ways to say them. Your brother’s drums are louder than your voice. Jim Dale blasting from his boom-box. You already know you are a nerd.Discover the internet in middle school. This first encounter leads you to the shore of the vast island of distraction. You find a gem called “For those who can still ride an airplane for the first time” by Anis Mojgani:
Slow down, Quentin, slow down.You don’t have to touch and go.You can see it all if your finger whispers on one word. Slow down, and hold what you see just a little bit longer.
You find something buttery and wonderful in the phonetic links between adjacent words. You feel like swinging from one verb phrase to the next on a trapeze of alliterations. You know you are like Quentin, the boy on the bus he is talking to, but you can’t figure out why.You figure it out. It’s because you could never do what Amal Kassir does when she spits poetry on YouTube. When she performs her poem “Syria” she is all fire and passion. When you watch this video in your room, you’re shivering:
We are speaking as one The tyrant inside of me is ravenousForty-one year old rotting hands bedazzledWith rings of oil drumsAnd gems of blood
When you come to college, decide that there is more to poetry than wimpy yellow flowers. There is sonorous bliss and there is bravery. You start writing for the sound of the words, and at first it comes out like products of Wernicke’s aphasia, but you say it out loud anyway because you are beginning to love your vocal folds and their flexibility in producing so many phonemes. Your words are not right, though, because there is no sense to their order. You’ve made beautiful motherese, but little else.Then you hear Sarah Kay perform “If I should have a daughter...” and what your poetry is lacking becomes clear:
 If I should have a daughter, instead of “Mom,” she’s going to call me “Point B.” Because that way she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me. And I’m going to paint the solar systems on the backs of her hands, so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say, “Oh, I know that like the back of my hand.” 
Poems tell stories. They are not so different from humans. We exist to create narratives of ourselves and to connect to others through these stories. You start to feel like you have something to say, so you listen more.You sit and listen to the  garbled announcements  of  the names of stations on the subway. You hear your grandmother’s Irish accent beneath her Boston one, and all of her history that goes with her voice. You look around you for once—perhaps during the quiet moments in section when no one has done the reading and you’re all wondering why you’re studying James Ferguson anyway—and you start to take wisdom from the world. There is injustice around you, and there is struggle. You hear young people write and talk about it in poems. Like “For All,” a poem that covers black American history from the beginnings of slavery to cases like Trayvon Martin, written and performed by Rob Gibsun at 2013 College Unions Poetry Slam Invitational.
 All burnt. All smoke. All weed. All trees. All rope.All neck. All jerk—All bleed. All rosepetals. No funerals. All mourn. All praying a lot. All praise to Allah—All “Ah!” Aw Lawd! Our Lord—
You see his body contort with the desire to be heard and understood. You love the human voice for all of its melodious variation and strength. There are so many things to say and interesting ways to say them. This is worth producing. This is worth listening to.

Sitting in the duct tape-patched driver’s seat of his “US Government Ranger” Chevy, Dad popped open two Budweisers and unwrapped two of the white-bread-and-rattlesnake sandwiches that he enjoyed frequently now that the Central Valley was in the midst of a severe rain shortage. He flipped on his Jim Croce cassette and handed me a sandwich. Sheepishly, he glanced at the beers. “I forgot to ask if you drink beer or not.”
I laughed. “Beer is fine, thanks.”
“A girl after my own heart. Just don’t tell Royella.” He chomped on a bite of rattler meat, and I tried to copy him. “She wouldn’t approve.”
I had spent the morning in Dad’s truck, skimming my assigned 12th grade summer reading and watching him work. As a forest ranger—or in his words, “steward of the land”—his job involved implementing new Sierra National Forest regulations . He had explained that, to prevent the spread of fire during this time of drought, rangers were tasked to clear all trees with a circumference of 20 inches or less. His worn hiking boots crunched against the ground cover as he worked, twisting a measuring tape around tree trunks and carelessly spray-painting red splotches on the trees that were now doomed for the chainsaw.
Taking a gulp of my beer and trying to mask my distaste for it, I thought briefly, and with a glimmer of longing, of Rachel and Marissa who were staying at home in New York for a summer of fruity cocktails, fake IDs, and sundress-clad beach trips. And I thought with guilt of Mom, alone in our Brooklyn apartment while her two kids visited her ex-husband, our dad, at “Foxglove,” our summer cabin. Formerly a New York photographer, he had transformed himself into a California forest ranger over the course of a single year and had no plans to return to Brooklyn, largely thanks to Royella.
Looking out over the grove of cedars and pine, I could see that roughly two-thirds of the trees had been defaced with Dad’s red paint.  His new job seemed nothing but the government’s excuse for depleting the land, turning the flourishing forest dusty and barren under the guise of fire safety.  Mom and Dad hadn’t raised us to pay much attention to God, but somehow Dad now went around claiming that his new job was one of serving as a steward to the Lord by tending to His land. Royella, the local pastor’s beautiful widow, had introduced him to the concept of stewardship, and he had taken the bait.
I thought about my grandfather—who had passed the Foxglove cabin down to my father—and remembered a hike we had taken on a nearby trail a few years back.  Densely packed pine trees towered above us, shading the ill-groomed path from either side. Grandpa had kept his eyes trained upward, studying the trees as we hiked. Several times I had grabbed his arm to keep him from tripping on roots. As we hiked, he told me that my Aunt Taylor, his daughter, was pressuring him to partially log the property, to sell the valuable timber so that none of us would have a financial worry again. “Once we begin to sell, loggers will notice our property, it’s only a matter of time ’til they get the rest,” I remember him saying. “One cut and the forest is done. We can’t do it.” When I asked him what he meant, he said something about the government and about influential private loggers: cash for trees.
“How d’ya like it?” Dad motioned to my sandwich, jolting me out of the memory.
“Good.” I swallowed the bite I was working on. “It tastes like chicken. But tougher.”
“Yup, this guy’s surprisingly muscular,” he said. “Killed him yesterday, a little before you kids got here. Royella was actually the one who spotted him. He was coiled by the side of the house, near the pump.”
I squeezed my beer can, denting the side and sloshing liquid out of the top. “Dad,” I said, “would you mind going easy on the Royella mentions?”
“Sure thing,” he said.
After lunch, he drove me back to the Foxglove cabin. As I walked around the side of the house—towards the back door that led to my bedroom—I saw a truck similar to Dad’s parked around the side.  A bearded forest ranger sat in the driver’s seat and rolled down the window as he saw me.
“Howdy,” he called out.
“Hi,” I said.
“Do you know where Miss Royella might be?” he asked.
I shrugged. “She lives down the road. You could try there.”
“Nah,” he said. “We had an appointment to meet here, to take a walk to look at some timber.”

Sant’Antonin in Venice appears to be a church no more. Instead of pews, six austere iron boxes stand in the center of the church. Weighing nearly two and a half tons each and measuring five feet by twelve feet, they immediately grab visitors’ attention. In the beautiful chapel adorned with frescoes and sculptures, the  boxes eerily resemble coffins. They are aptly named S.A.C.R.E.D, each letter standing for a different box’s theme: Supper, Accusers, Cleansing, Ritual, Entropy, and Doubt. The mood is somber.
The piece was one of the exhibitions at the 2013 Venice Biennale by the well-known Chinese political dissident and artist Ai Weiwei. In 2011, in what many believe to be an attempt by the Chinese government to quell his revolutionary attitude, Ai spent 81 days in prison for alleged tax evasion. Once released, he set to work creating “S.A.C.R.E.D.,”  a six-stage installation that offers viewers his experience in solitary detention. Each box contains a diorama depicting Ai’s intimate moments spent in prison—sleeping, using the bathroom, and, of course, interrogation.
The scenes, which take the viewers through various stages of Ai Weiwei’s stay in the prison, create an atmosphere of discomfort. In one box, as Ai eats his dinner, two guards hover around him, recording every minute and benign move. Their blank faces yield no sympathy. In Ai’s portrayal, the guards become machines, only interested in controlling the dissident. In another scene, as Ai Weiwei sleeps with both of his arms and legs spread out, the guards stand ever-present at the top and the bottom of the bed. The entire scene is illuminated in harsh, fluorescent light. Underneath the white blanket that contours his body like a garment, Ai becomes reminiscent of Christ.
Perhaps even more unsettling than the art itself is the way the scenes are portrayed, which forces the viewers to become implicit in this flagrant violation of human rights. The doors on the boxes are merely part of the boxes’ façades. Instead, Ai has placed small apertures on the surfaces of the boxes so that the viewers must peer into the cells rather than walk through them. The viewers cannot do anything but passively observe and acknowledge the wrong.
In forcing the viewers to become complicit voyeurs, Ai may be criticizing not only the Chinese government  but also the inactive citizens—those who simply go along with the government’s agenda. “[Ai Weiwei] was watched all the time during his detention under obsessive surveillance at a very close proximity,” S.A.C.R.E.D. curator Maurizio Bortolotti says. “Through his dioramas he upturns this situation, making us, the viewers, [watch] the guards who are in turn watching him.”
Some may be tempted to criticize S.AC.R.E.D. for evoking an exaggerated portrait of martyrdom.  However, according to Greg Hilty of London’s Lisson Gallery, Ai is not trying to position himself as a martyr in S.A.C.R.E.D. “He is not pretending to be a saint, but the setting does suggest things such as the stations of the cross or the temptations of St. Anthony, to whom the church is dedicated,” Hilty, who is hosting S.A.C.R.E.D., says. “But these are human, universal things that go beyond Ai Weiwei...he’s not saying he’s a saint, or that he is wholly right or good. He’s just being honest.”
Overall, S.A.C.R.E.D. is a powerful work in that it forces viewers to confront the oppression of political dissidents in China by physically walking viewers through Ai Weiwei’s own experience. The audience will never know if the work was Ai’s way to defend his status as a genuine political dissident or if he solely wanted to convey a selfless political message. Nevertheless, S.A.C.R.E.D. still sheds light on the everyday repression of political critics in China. And it also gently reminds viewers that they must not remain mere viewers of oppression but must also take a stance against such violation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s well known that sports-related injuries can devastate athletes’ careers as well as their bodies. When a famous athlete is felled by an injury, the story is likely to receive considerable publicity. But less publicized are the equally grave struggles faced by performers to maintain their health and rehabilitate their bodies following performance-related injuries. Performing artists dance, sing, and make music with a grace and ease that belies the strain that such activities can place on the body. In reality, performers are constantly engaged in a battle against injuries and pain that could separate them from what they love: their art.
Fortunately, artists do not have to engage in this struggle on their own. In the industry of performance-related rehabilitation, specialists work not only to help heal artists but also to prevent injury in the first place. Student performers at Harvard who treat their craft as seriously as athletes treat their sports have had to cope with a wide variety of injuries and learn how to treat their bodies in order to protect against future damage. Meanwhile, doctors at the nearby Harvard-affiliated Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital are working to revolutionize performance-related injury rehab. While the specifics of different performers’ stories vary widely, the stress on knowing the right way to practice your craft is consistent. For those seeking a life-long career in performance, proper form and technical foundation are imperative to staying healthy. How to realize this imperative is far from obvious.
A DANGEROUS DANCE
Ileana C. Riveron ’17 never planned on applying to college. A member of the Royal Dance Company in London from 2008 to 2011 and of the Boston Ballet from 2011 to 2013, Riveron had an established career as a dancer.  However, 17 years of dancing (12 of them en pointe) had a devastating effect on the young dancer’s feet. The thought of rehearsal began to bring tears to Riveron’s eyes; even walking caused her considerable pain. Riveron’s story is not a unique one in the ballet community. Recalling her days as a member of a professional dance company, Riveron describes an environment where pain was the norm. “Everyone is in quite a bit of pain at all times,” Riveron says. “The [physical therapy] room is always jam-packed full of dancers.”
When her feet did not recover after two months off from dancing for a broken wrist, Riveron was diagnosed with degenerative joint disease. Her doctors told her that she would likely never be able to dance again and that she should told start looking for a new career. “It was heartbreaking,” she says.
Riveron did not take the news lying down. Even before the doctors’ devastating prognosis, she had begun an intensive rehabilitation program that incorporated a spate of treatments. “I started getting ultrasounds done on my feet every day, [and] stem treatments, which is like electroshock therapy for your feet,” Riveron says. “I got injections a couple of months later…for two years I was on hardcore painkillers.”
It was while Riveron was engaged in her rehabilitation regimen that she made the decision to apply to Harvard. Because it led her to pursuing an undergraduate education as opposed to embarking on a professional career straight out of high school, Riveron has come to view her injuries as a blessing in disguise. “I will always love dance, but I’m so happy I’m here,” she says.
Though Riveron will never dance professionally again, rehabilitative treatments have enabled her to recover enough to dance in a non-professional context. After matriculating at Harvard, Riveron joined the Harvard Ballet Company. Since returning to dancing, she has adopted habits that combat the possibility of future injury. “I know now that I could’ve prevented how bad my feet got,” she says. “[Now] I tape them a special way, and they don’t bother me unless I push too hard and do things I shouldn’t.”
INSTRUMENTAL STRESS
Whereas a ballet dancer’s struggle may stem from too many hours en pointe, instrumentalists are a class of performers instructed to keep their feet planted firmly on the ground. But this difference in podiatric orientation does not exempt musicians from doing battle with performance-related injuries. Gabriela D.M. Ruiz-Colon ’16 didn’t start playing cello until high school. Determined to catch up to the level of her peers, she spent two hours every morning practicing her instrument.  “It was a very intense regimen and very physically demanding,” Ruiz-Colon says. “I developed tendonitis on my right and left hand…just from playing too much…. It was one of the sharpest pains [I’ve] ever [experienced].”
Ruiz-Colon’s condition forced her to cut back in her practice time and ultimately take a break from cello. It also led her to work with a teacher to develop recovery strategies, including many elaborate hand stretches. “As a musician, I wasn’t really aware that [stretching] was a thing you had to do because at orchestra concerts you see this virtuoso that plays so gracefully,” she says. “But you don’t really see all the stuff that happens behind the scenes. It’s not just the practicing, but making sure that your hand muscles are well.”
By pacing her practices and maintaining her stretching regimen, Ruiz-Colon regained the ability to play cello. Like Riveron, her experiences with injury taught her to be mindful of her body in her approach to musicianship. “It’s like how you can’t become a runner and just start running a marathon,” she says. “I had to build up stamina.” Although she is currently taking a semester off due to a busy schedule, Ruiz-Colon has continued playing cello at Harvard with the River Charles Ensemble and in pit orchestras.
Had Ruiz-Colon continued to play as often as she did without adapting her playing habits, it is possible her condition would eventually have led to far steeper consequences for her body. As a pianist at Berklee College of Music, Erik Hanson practiced his instrument for four to six hours a day. After months of this intensive schedule, Erik developed an extreme case of tendonitis. Eventually, he was forced not merely to cease playing, but to stop using of his right hand altogether. He got out of his performance requirements at Berklee and spent the last year and a half of college writing with his left hand.
Hanson’s debilitating pain continued to plague him long after he graduated from college.  “I’d play for 30 minutes and then hurt for three days,” he says. “I had to minimize the use of my right hand for 25 years.” After giving physical therapy and acupuncture another shot, Hanson decided to reevaluate the foundation of his technique. Although he had taken lessons for years as a child, Hanson’s problems came from the very basics of his performance process. Realizing this led him to discover the Golandsky Institute, an organization dedicated to educating and rehabilitating musicians that uses the Taubman Approach: a corrective process based on close analysis of piano virtuosos that trains pianists to keep their muscles in natural alignment.
This approach worked wonders for Hanson, who can now play piano for up to eight hours at a time. After searching 25 years for a way to painlessly do his passion, Hanson is astounded by what the simple changes in technique have done for his playing. “It’s amazing!” he says. “I never thought I’d be able to play fast again. I just wanted to not hurt, and to my surprise after about 18 months of this new training, my speed had doubled and now I can do things that I never thought I could do.”
VOCAL AWARENESS
Vocalists are one class of performers that seems to be acutely aware of the importance of preventing injuries through consistent practice of proper habits. The voice is an incredibly fragile instrument, and the need to maintain one’s vocal health has a considerable influence on the lifestyles of serious singers. Camille L. Crossot ’16, who plans on pursuing a career as an opera singer (she recently performed the role of Despina in the Dunster House Opera Society’s production of “Così fan tutte”), knows what it means to always be alert about the impact of daily choices on one’s voice. Such surveillance is particularly important when one is in the rehearsal process for a show, or in the middle of a show’s run. “I know a lot of people’s voices really suffer here, just because it’s so much,” she says. Crossot is careful to rest her voice whenever she can, refraining from singing outside of rehearsal. She also carries a water bottle with her constantly, as even a simple dry throat can mean missing rehearsals.
Allison A. Ray ’14, who also hopes to become an opera singer in the future, performed as Dorabella alongside Crossot in “Così fan tutte.” Ray also played the female lead in the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Player’s fall production of “The Pirates of Penzance.” Ray says, “The biggest issue with vocal performance that most people have is usually too much strain or overuse of the vocal chords.” Opera and musical theater are especially wearying; performers tend to push themselves to sing louder and belt higher. “They’re trying to create a certain measure of volume or a certain amount of sound,” she explains. Often, this can cause calluses to develop on the vocal chords.
Protecting the voice against this does not only involve utilizing proper singing techniques but also modifying one’s everyday speech. “People have to go to speech therapists…because they’re speaking really low in their register, where their voice sounds like its cracking, which puts a lot of pressure on the vocal folds.” Ray says. “The goal of vocal rehabilitation is to teach people to speak and to sing without putting too much pressure on the vocal folds…which involves placing the voice higher in their register.”
AT THE FOREFRONT OF PREVENTION
When it comes to preventing further injury, the development of healthful performance habits is of paramount importance. Performance-related rehabilitation specialists work not only to help heal injured artists but also to prevent injury in the first place by helping them to develop the proper habits that are instrumental in safeguarding one’s ability to perform. This prevention-focused philosophy is a fitting response to the innocent lack of awareness that was at the root of the performance-related injuries incurred by Ruiz-Colon and Riveron.
At the forefront of this field, and heralding this philosophy, is the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The teaching partner of the Harvard Medical School Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Spaulding is one of the nation’s leaders in performance rehabilitation. The Spaulding Hospital for Continuing Medical Care, an affiliate of the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Network, is located in Cambridge.
When one first enters this acute-care center, it feels like a standard hospital, sterile and quiet, but upon taking a right, left, and another right, a more unconventional wing of Spaulding is revealed: a music rehabilitation center. This wing of Spaulding boasts a grand piano, gym equipment, and “Easy Street,” a mock neighborhood complete with a bumpy terrain that prepares clients to navigate the cobblestone and uneven roads of Boston and a grocery store where stroke victims can regain their ability to grasp and reach.
Each of these fixtures is integral to the Healthy Performing Artists Program. Launched five years ago, the program  has provided aid to numerous local musicians. The goal of the program is simple: to help ensure that a musician’s body never interferes with his or her passion.
“We developed it to be a two-tiered program,” says Catherine Wee, an occupational therapist and certified hand therapist at the center. “Number one, for people who are musicians who are already insured and need to recover from that injury…and go back to playing again—The second part is about prevention.”
To prevent injury, Wee takes her patients through an ergonomic assessment, observing clients as they play their instrument in order to monitor movement. Once Wee has determined what harmful habits a musician has developed, she works with them over several sessions to modify their movements. Modifications are normally small—adjustments to grip or placement of the instrument—but tiny changes such as these have a huge impact over time. “Musicians often develop some bad habits, which contribute to this ongoing pain, which musicians ignore a lot of times because they think they’re supposed to have it,” Wee says. “Everyone has the pain, so they just live with it, but they are not realizing that they can do something to change that.”
The program also aims to make musicians more mindful about the need to take care of their bodies. Unlike professional athletes with teams of personal trainers and coaches, musicians are often not trained to be mindful of their bodies. But the strain placed on professional musicians’ bodies is comparable to that placed on those of professional athletes. “These guys are playing above and beyond just practicing,” says the manager of the Spaulding Cambridge Outpatient Center Melanie Deveikas. “They’re athletes of music.”
In order to combat this lack of awareness, the Healthy Performance Artist Program has collaborated with the New England Conservatory and is currently working with Berklee School of Music to start injury prevention early into in budding musicians’ careers. At individual 30-minute appointments with students, representatives from the program attempt to instill the importance of healthful musicianship. “It’s not a treatment session. It’s an educational session,” Wee says. “We point them in the right direction before they develop bad habits.”
Wee and Deveikas have more than Spaulding in common—both are artists themselves. Wee played piano, and Deveikas played violin and flute. The doctors agree that having a background as an artist is an important asset for a performance rehabilitation specialist. When an artist is faced with the prospect of having to give up the activity that is at once their passion and their career, the emotional toll can be considerable. “It helps to have an understanding of what music really means to them—how passionate they are,” Wee says. “Because they love their art so much, they are very tied to that craft…. So we need to be able to empathize.”
Timothy Sullivan, head of communications at Spaulding, hopes that through prevention-focused programs more artists will be taught to prevent injury from a young age, and will consequently be able to avoid ever having to cope with injuries that can cause mental as well as physical trauma—heartbreak like Riveron’s. “The ideal is to work with our patients to develop the right habits to avoid injuries…to help people know how to live and perform well enough so that they don’t have to come see us.”
Clearly, the kind of awareness Sullivan hopes for is not unreasonable. Performers educated about how to avoid practicing their craft in potentially dangerous ways seem dedicated to maintaining salutary habits. Modern rehabilitation programs aim to offer increased opportunities for education that will allow more artists to learn this information at the outset of their careers, rather than as the result of painful experiences.

Like Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, Iggy Azalea and Charli XCX fuse dance beats, drops, and rap—but despite its rap influences, Azalea’s new single “Fancy” ends up sounding more pop than hip-hop. Azalea’s verses miss many of their opportunities to substantiate the song’s lyricism, but given the effectiveness of the dance beat, the trade-off quickly becomes worthwhile. In the context of Azalea’s discography, the track is experimental, and to dismiss this song as another pop single would be a mistake. The track transcends the “club” setting and affirms Azalea’s break from her comfort zone. Charli XCX moves the song in a pop direction, while Iggy executes her raps cleanly, their collaboration imbuing the song with an underground “hip-pop” feel. Yet focusing on the beat may distract from the more subtle qualities of the track, such as Azalea’s extravagant version of female empowerment. Reversing the trend of male dominance in hip-hop, Iggy comes off as a woman who knows her worth. Through “Fancy,” she breaks from the mainstream and hopefully opens up the floor for more female rappers.
 “The New Classic” is out on April 14 via Island Def Jam in the United States.

If Angel Olsen has proven anything to us in the past, it’s that tragedy can be musically striking in the right hands. With her newest studio creation, the singer-songwriter continues to flaunt her mastery for pulling heartstrings with stunning results. “Burn Your Fire For No Witness” is a record that expertly weaves her penchant for beautiful gloom with her skill as a vocalist and musician. Of course, we’ve seen this mastery before in Olsen’s previous studio endeavors; she’s already shown she takes the “tortured artist” aesthetic to heart, and fans love her for it. This record is no exception; the heartbreak that made Olsen’s other works successful is just as potent here.
 
Although “Burn Your Fire” follows the same emotional lines as other Olsen works, the album also marks a progressive change for the artist. Olsen’s songwriting grows in complexity, incorporating several new elements to the orchestration that give the record a fuller, more electrified sound. Guitar tracks laden with effects, hard-nosed drum beats, and echoing layers of backing vocals are a far cry from the bare, acoustic tracks we’re used to hearing from Olsen. This definitely isn’t the singer-songwriter we know—but the new Angel Olsen might be stronger than ever.
 
The album starts off innocently enough with a tribute to Olsen’s past. “Unfucktheworld” is a straightforward, waltzing mix of steady strumming and searching vocals. However, as soon as the second track, “Forgiven/Forgotten,” begins, it unveils a new, grungier Angel Olsen. An uncompromising, hard-edged guitar provides the base for the track, allowing Olsen’s pointed refrains to become the center of attention. She’s not just the requisite amount of sad, either—the singer allows her anger full reign over her vocal expression, baring herself to listeners with the full fury of a songwriter in distress. Starting off at a slow burn, she builds intensity, unleashing a previously underutilized belting power reminiscent of Grace Slick over a pulsing, high-energy soundscape of guitar and backing orchestration. Luckily for Olsen, resentment is just as flattering on her as sadness.
 
From here, “Burn Your Fire” continues to branch out, reaching an emotional depth unsurpassed by any of the singer-songwriter’s previous works. The bones of her usual songwriting style remain, but Olsen takes heartbreak to new heights, dressed up with more electronic elements and artistic orchestration choices. For the most part, the new components only amplify Olsen’s ability to express emotion through her music. On “Hi-Five”, she gives her country-tinted songwriting a new twist with added guitar distortion and layering—Johnny Cash meets Patsy Cline, and they find an overdrive pedal. Similarly, on “Dance Slow Decades,” thundering drums encase Olsen’s lamentations in a cavern of sound, giving her more space to sigh amid the anchored strumming of a waltzing acoustic guitar.
 
Of course, with the incorporation of new components, Olsen runs the risk of betraying her original aesthetic. Fans shouldn’t fear, however; this is a move she makes with poise, and these additional elements mostly add to the impact of her songs. There are a few moments (“Stars” is one example) where the singer seems caught under heavy layers of sound, muddying her usually clear vocals. If it weren’t for her penetrating voice, this music would collapse into a heap of folk and sadness—the only reason Olsen can afford to take such creative steps is because she has the pipes to back it up.
 
This incredible vocal talent, along with the songwriter’s potent lyrics, form a foundation that can easily support the added flair. Despite Olsen’s best efforts, though, her artistry still shines brightest in a stripped-down setting. Minimalist tracks “Enemy” and “Iota” prove that it’s hard to write anything less than amazing with a distinctively expressive voice, an overflowing supply of raw emotion, and a guitar. Another standout is “White Fire”, an eerie lament to lost dreams. Olsen’s voice ebbs and flows to the tune of captivating sorrow, and we can’t help but ride the tide with her.
 “Burn Your Fire For No Witness” is a mesmerizing record, proving that Angel Olsen’s charm has only increased with her creative development as a songwriter. Whether clothed in complex layers of orchestration or reduced to their barest components, these songs demonstrate that the true essence here lies with her powerful voice and heartfelt writing style. “Burn Your Fire For No Witness” is an entrancing and melancholy amalgam of “I wish I” and “if only”; this is modern indie-folk music at its best.

Whenever army chiefs don gaudy epaulettes and oversized shades, democracy’s death is sure to follow. Perhaps there is only one autocratic accessorizer for those with dictatorial designs.
Which brings me to the shady and shade-wearing General Abdul Fattah Al-Sisi, current commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces, who took control of the country after the deposition of Egypt’s first democratically elected president, Mohammad Morsi, in a military coup. Of course, the U.S. government never acknowledged the putsch, preferring contorted casuistry to inconvenient truths.
“Ce n’est pas un coup d’état,” a modern-day Magritte might remark.
For American foreign policy, Egypt’s case is a Schrodinger’s Cat: a detestable coup that undermines our supposed worldwide conviction to democracy, but simultaneously a convenient dictatorship that seizes power away from the Muslim Brotherhood and places it back in the hands of the preferable military dictatorship. 
Egyptian phantasmagoria doesn’t end with Surrealist Sisi though. In its brutal crackdown on Islamists that killed thousands, the military-backed government also found time to open a terrorism probe into a popular Muppet-style puppet, Abla Fahita, who was suspected of sending coded messages to the Muslim Brotherhood at the behest of an activist named Ahmed Spider.
But for Sisi, the cult of personality couldn’t come fast enough—so he took it upon himself to do some mythmaking by describing a number of prophetic dreams that presaged his eminence. In one, Sisi informs former Egyptian leader Anwar Sadat that “I will be president of the republic.” In another, the fearless general wields a sword with the central Islamic creed—“There is no God but Allah”—written in red. 
There’s materialism amongst the mysticism too: Another dream sees the general “wearing an Omega watch with a big green star”—another Islamic icon—which Dr. Sigmund Sisi interprets to mean: “It is because of my name. It is Omega and I’m Abdul Fattah, so there something universal between us.”
But watching the tyro tyrant fumble isn’t just a matter of gaffes and gaucherie. Hundreds of protesting Egyptians were massacred at Rabaa al-Adawiya square. The four-fingered salute that commemorates the dead has become a symbol of protest that the government squashes ruthlessly—arresting a 15-year-old student for drawing the symbol in class.
How can those who fulminated about the Muslim Brotherhood’s ascendancy on the basis of human rights keep mum on the return to Mubarakism?
Every ominous prediction made about the reviled Morsi administration applies in fuller force to the current government. The same language enshrining Shariah in the constitution that drew so much ire in the Morsi regime remains in the newest draft—yet the outcry has yet to be seen. Article 74, banning political parties “formed on the basis of religion” and activities that are deemed “hostile to democracy, secretive, or which possess a military ore quasi-military nature,” seems antithetical to democratic values—yet not a peep from Secretary of State John Kerry who shakes the general’s hand and claims that he is “restoring democracy.”
Free speech and civil liberties have been restricted immensely—much worse than either Morsi or even Mubarak. The popular Egyptian comedian Bassem Yousssef, whose political satire continued through the Morsi regime, had his TV show cancelled last year. The military shut down several stations that offered dissenting (read: not propagandistic) news, has detained large numbers of journalists, and is currently prosecuting 20 Al-Jazeera journalists for raising “alarms about the state’s collapse.”
That’s to say nothing of the government’s treatment of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been deemed a terrorist group and whose leaders have been jailed. While Mubarak was released from jail, Morsi was held incommunicado for months and is locked in a soundproof glass cage during his ongoing show trial. If that’s not suppression of free speech, I don’t know what is.
To those living in the Middle East, it seems that America prefers autocracy to the legitimate self-determination of people. Sisi comes in a long line of America’s autocratic all-stars: Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, King Hamad Al-Khalifah of Bahrain, etc.
President Obama’s lofty rhetoric of democracy and human rights can barely muster a whimper in the Middle East. American policy remains a myopic devotion to propping up dictators in the Muslim world. 
And the same stench of paternalism makes its ugly self known: “We don’t trust the uncivilized Muslim masses to govern themselves—better that a spineless autocrat with a firm hand rule over you,” remains the perceived message to the Arab World.
I wonder why there is so much antipathy toward America, maybe it’s—
No. Probably because they hate our freedom.

In July 1971, Harvard psychology professor Richard J. Herrnstein penned an article for Atlantic Monthly titled “I.Q.” in which he endorsed the theories of UC Berkeley psychologist Arthur Jensen, who had claimed that intelligence is almost entirely hereditary and varies by race. Herrnstein further argued that because intelligence was hereditary, social programs intended to establish a more egalitarian society were futile—he wrote that “social standing [is] based to some extent on inherited differences among people.”
 
When he returned to campus for fall semester 1971, Herrnstein was met by angry student activists. Harvard-Radcliffe Students for a Democratic Society protested his introductory psychology class with a bullhorn and leaflets. They tied up Herrnstein’s lectures with pointed questions about scientific racism. SDS even called for Harvard to fire Herrnstein, along with another of his colleagues, sociologist Christopher Jencks.
 
Herrnstein told The Crimson, “The attacks on me have not bothered me personally… What bothers me is this: Something has happened at Harvard this year that makes it hazardous for a professor to teach certain kinds of views.” This, Herrnstein seems not to have understood, was precisely the goal of the SDS activists—they wanted to make the “certain kinds of views” they deemed racist and classist unwelcome on Harvard’s campus.
 
Harvard’s deans were also unhappy. They expressed concerns about student activists’ “interference with the academic freedom and right to speak of a member of the Harvard faculty.” Did SDS activists at Harvard infringe on Herrnstein’s academic freedom? The answer might be that yes, they did—but that’s not the most important question to ask. Student and faculty obsession with the doctrine of “academic freedom” often seems to bump against something I think much more important: academic justice.
In its oft-cited Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, the American Association of University Professors declares that “Teachers are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results.” In principle, this policy seems sound: It would not do for academics to have their research restricted by the political whims of the moment.
 
Yet the liberal obsession with “academic freedom” seems a bit misplaced to me. After all, no one ever has “full freedom” in research and publication. Which research proposals receive funding and what papers are accepted for publication are always contingent on political priorities. The words used to articulate a research question can have implications for its outcome. No academic question is ever “free” from political realities. If our university community opposes racism, sexism, and heterosexism, why should we put up with research that counters our goals simply in the name of “academic freedom”?
Instead, I would like to propose a more rigorous standard: one of “academic justice.” When an academic community observes research promoting or justifying oppression, it should ensure that this research does not continue.
The power to enforce academic justice comes from students, faculty, and workers organizing together to make our universities look as we want them to do. Two years ago, when former summer school instructor Subramanian Swamy published hateful commentary about Muslims in India, the Harvard community organized to ensure that he would not return to teach on campus. I consider that sort of organizing both appropriate and commendable. Perhaps it should even be applied more broadly. Does Government Professor Harvey Mansfield have the legal right to publish a book in which he claims that “to resist rape a woman needs … a certain ladylike modesty?” Probably. Do I think he should do that? No, and I would happily organize with other feminists on campus to stop him from publishing further sexist commentary under the authority of a Harvard faculty position. “Academic freedom” might permit such an offensive view of rape to be published; academic justice would not.
Over winter break, Harvard published a statement responding to the American Studies Association’s resolution to boycott Israeli academic institutions until Israel ends its occupation of Palestine.  Much of the conversation around this academic boycott has focused on academic freedom. Opponents of the boycott claim that it restricts the freedom of Israeli academics or interrupts the “free flow of ideas.” Proponents of the boycott often argue that the boycott is intended to, in the end, increase, not restrict, academic freedom—the ASA points out that “there is no effective or substantive academic freedom for Palestinian students and scholars under conditions of Israeli occupation.”
 
In this case, discourse about “academic freedom” obscures what should fundamentally be a political argument. Those defending the academic boycott should use a more rigorous standard. The ASA, like three other academic associations, decided to boycott out of a sense of social justice, responding to a call by Palestinian civil society organizations for boycotts, divestment, and sanctions until Israel ends its occupation of Palestine. People on the right opposed to boycotts can play the “freedom” game, calling for economic freedom to buy any product or academic freedom to associate with any institution. Only those who care about justice can take the moral upper hand.
 
It is tempting to decry frustrating restrictions on academic research as violations of academic freedom. Yet I would encourage student and worker organizers to instead use a framework of justice. After all, if we give up our obsessive reliance on the doctrine of academic freedom, we can consider more thoughtfully what is just.

It is no secret that Harvard maintains close relationships with China and Chinese universities. Yet the recent dismissal of former economics professor and dissident  Xia Yeliang from Peking University has caused American universities like Wellesley and Stanford to question ties with Beijing in the face of differing views on academic freedom. While Harvard’s ties with China are essential to a globalized education, Harvard should stand up for academic freedom and structure its partnerships with foreign universities carefully.
 
While Peking University has claimed that its decision to terminate Xia Yeliang’s position can be purely attributed to academic and not political reasons, there is strong reason to suspect that Xia’s outspoken and liberal politics played a role in his dismissal. Xia helped draft Charter 08, which called for major pro-democratic change. The petition’s primary author is another persecuted scholar-dissident—Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo.  And heightened state attention in the lead-up to Xia’s firing coincided with a political social media push from Xia abroad in the U.S. As he transitions to a new position at the Cato Institute, American universities are faced with the difficult decision of whether or not to react against Peking University and China’s free speech restrictions by terminating partnerships. Harvard, as of yet, has not—and should not.
 
Through programs like the Harvard China Forum, Harvard Business School’s Senior Executive Program for China, and Harvard’s Shanghai outpost, the University’s partnerships with China allow students to gain global experience in a nation that doubles as rich culture and rising power. The Harvard China Forum boasts a place as America’s leading student forum for China, a unique opportunity for students interested in work in and with Asia. The intellectual and professional benefits offered by Harvard’s international alliances are part of what draws applicants to Harvard. The University should not act to terminate its broadly positive influence in China.
 
However, Harvard’s ties with China provide a special opportunity to stand up for the ideals and principles we purport to hold—especially academic freedom. While not reason enough to terminate alliances, Harvard should certainly urge its corporate and university partners towards human rights and free speech. Harvard can engage with overseas universities while avoiding joint campuses that have raised concerns at other institutions.
 Partnerships with China, a mutually advantageous relationship for China’s economy and for global-minded students, offer benefits that Harvard cannot pass up. Cutting ties will solve little—but will isolate academic populations and curb the longer-term idea exchange that fosters real progress. Still, in the wake of Xia’s dismissal, we must proceed with heightened awareness for the academic values Harvard as an institution stands for.

Students could choose among a more exotic set of offerings than the usual brunch fare of Veritaffles and omelettes Sunday afternoon at Harvard University Dining Services' annual festive brunch, which was themed “World Street Food.”
Street food items included fried green beans from China, currywurst from Germany, and taquitos de puerco from Spain. For dessert, students could try out gelato flavors such as espresso, mango sorbet, and Tahitian vanilla. Dining halls were decked in multicolored tablecloths and flags representing the origins of the food featured in the menu.
“Every year for the past several [years], we have put forward several theme menu ideas and we invite students to vote on them,” said Crista Martin, HUDS director for marketing and communications.
Students were asked to vote on the theme last semester as a part of a HUDS satisfaction survey sent to students in October. Of the 2,603 students who replied, 42.6 percent of them chose “World Street Foods” as the theme they preferred to see. The theme “United Nations” was second with 22.1 percent.
“Once we know we know what the theme is going to be we then talk about what recipes are going to be used,” Martin said. “It’s about what is popular. We also have to consider what people would like to eat and balancing the different needs of the students like making sure there’s an option for vegetarians.”
Students had mixed opinions regarding the special dining hall menu.
Julie R. Macdonell ’14 said she enjoyed the variety of choices available.
“It was fun that there was so many different options and a lot of cuisine that I had not tried before,” she said.
Other students said they did not completely appreciate the implementation of the special menu.
“I thought it would be a change from what we normally have, ” said Wafa B. Abdel Nabi ’17. “I tried the beef kibbeh from Lebanon and while the taste is not that bad, the presentation [left much] to be desired.”
“I didn’t want to try the Mexican Street Salad because I’m Mexican and I’m pretty sure that’s not a thing, but I give them an A for effort,” said Leslie J. Montes ’14.
The theme for last year’s annual festive spring meal was Brazilian Barbeque.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: Feb. 18, 2014, at 5:58 a.m.
Dunster House residents had the opportunity to view the rooms they may inhabit next year during a walkthrough of several suites at 20-20A Prescott Street Friday afternoon. Students in Dunster will occupy swing housing spaces, including the Prescott Street location, next year when the House becomes the first to be renovated in its entirety as part of the University’s House Renewal project.
Students toured select single, double, and triple suites on the second floor of the property. Each comes equipped with a full kitchen, including a refrigerator and stove, as well as a common room and storage space. Dunster House administrators said these rooms are representative of the majority of suites in the building. According to construction workers at the Prescott Street site, the buildings will undergo further renovations, including the installation of Wi-Fi, sprinkler and intercom systems, and handicap access.
Dunster students will be spread across swing housing around the Square during renovations, which are set to begin in June 2014. The former Inn at Harvard, shut down in July 2013, will also serve as swing housing for Dunster residents. The University is currently revamping the building to include a dining hall, dorm-style bedrooms, and social spaces.
Despite the Prescott Street property’s distance from the Inn at Harvard, Dunster residents who were interviewed by The Crimson said they approved of the housing.
“I was kind of iffy about it because this seems a little farther away from the Inn, and I didn’t really know that we would even have this swing housing, but it’s amazing,” said Emma R. Payne ’16, who added that she was impressed by the quality of the housing.
“It’s so classy, and everyone has kitchens,” she said. “Even a kitchen in a double is just amazing. I’m really excited, and I definitely want to live here.”
Jeff J. Fischer ’15 also said he was enthusiastic about the prospect of living in the swing space.
“I had seen the floor plans, so I knew that the layout was generous, but this exceeds expectations,” he said, adding that he and his roommates are hoping to live in the Prescott Street housing next year.
“I’m very excited for next year,” he said. “I’m looking for a fast forward button.”
In addition, swing housing for displaced Dunster students will include buildings used during the renewals of Quincy and Leverett: Fairfax Hall at 1306 Mass. Ave., Hampden Hall at 8 Plympton St., and Ridgely Hall at 65 Mt. Auburn St.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
A few couples were blessed this Valentine's Day not by Cupid but by the UC, which awarded two $50 grants to students who submitted the most creative date proposals last week.
Mark D. Levin-Gesundheit ’16 and Ankit Gupta ’17 won the couples competition, while Eunice P. Lee ’17 won a $100 grant for the most creative group date proposal.
Over 60 people applied for a UC-funded Valentines Day, according to Council member C.C. Gong '15, who is an inactive Crimson editor. Proposals ranged from a single-person burrito binge to an eight-person naked brunch that would push “the boundaries of feminism full force.”
Gupta advanced a winning proposal to take his long time girlfriend Lucy L. Nam ’17 on a date commemorating the four years of their relationship. In his proposal, Gupta presented an elaborate plan to revisit memorable activities from previous dates, including bowling, pottery-making, dining at a Boston restaurant, and walking around while snacking on ice cream with sprinkles.
 
“I want to thank the UC for giving us the opportunity to go on such a great date,” said Nam, who added that the night was a great way to relive many moments with her boyfriend.
Levin-Gesundheit won attention and funding from the UC for a proposal that, according to Gong, went above and beyond a typical dinner idea.
The Thoreau-themed date involved Levin-Gesundheit taking his girlfriend of four months, who is an English major, to 80 Thoreau, an acclaimed restaurant in Concord, Mass. Levin-Gesundheit also planned to read select passages from Thoreau while keeping warm at Walden Pond with hot chocolate and blankets.
Lee won the group proposal category for an outing designed to forge “cultural connections.” Along with five other friends, Lee participated in different activities around the Boston area that would allow for the group to learn more about different cultures.
“Diversity here on campus is really amazing, and I just wanted to take advantage of that,” Lee said. “The UC grant gave us the really nice chance to try a lot of really fun things.”
Activities included a picnic in Boston Common and karaoke in Allston, which Lee said was particularly enjoyable when everyone sang along and laughed as Psy’s “Gangnam Style” played.
Gong noted that several other proposals, which were not accepted, displayed considerable sentiment and drama. She pointed to a date idea from Chris R. Lee ’14, who, according to Gong, would have won an award for most dramatic proposal.
“For 6-7 of my friends and one's other friend, and maybe a guy from Dunster but probably not, I propose that we escape Cambridge's pulsating vice grip and run away to a simpler place in a simpler time called: Boston,” Lee wrote. “More specifically, their movie theater. More more specifically, whichever room of that theater shows 'The Lego Movie.'”
The grants are part of an ongoing tradition for Valentine’s Day. Previous UC-funded dates have facilitated a marriage proposal and llama-hiking excursion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 18, 2014, at 2:05 p.m.
The Undergraduate Council welcomed eleven newly elected representatives and two new social czars at its weekly meeting Monday evening, before launching into a discussion of the honor code draft approved last week and gender-neutral housing.
Special elections are held every spring to fill positions vacated by representatives who resign or choose to leave for personal reasons.
This semester, the UC sought to fill twelve seats—three in Cabot House, two in Kirkland House, and one each in Oak Yard, Adams, Currier, Dunster, Eliot, Leverett, and Mather Houses.
Four students ran uncontested for the available spots in Adams, Kirkland, and Currier. No candidates submitted candidacy declarations in Leverett, Dunster, or Mather Houses and write-in votes were used to elect representatives to those seats, according to an internal UC document.
The special election, similar to those in the past, drew significantly lower voter turnout and fewer candidates than ordinary elections held in the fall. Wesley K. Chen ’14, chair of the Election Commission, which independently manages UC elections, said in an interview Sunday that the total number of votes in any House or Yard did not exceed 100.
In the Leverett House election, two of the candidates running, Isaac G. Inkeles ’16 and Dana E. Katzenelson ’15, tied with seven votes apiece. Chen said that, after discussing the matter with UC leaders, the Council decided that a runoff election will be held later this week to decide the victor.
With 11 of the 12 empty positions filled, the UC began a renewed discussion of two recent issues that were brought before the Council again by various students.
Although not a UC representative, Matthew J. O'Connor '17 presented an amendment to the honor code draft approved by the Council last week. Although O'Connor supports forming an honor code, he called the current draft “a hollow and meaningless exercise in public relations.”
 
O'Connor objected to the affirmation component of the honor code, which would require students to sign a statement attesting to their honor on each assignment graded or turned in for review.
 
He suggested that students instead be required to individually meet with their professors at the beginning and end of each semester to attest that they will act and have acted honorably while completing their work.
 
Despite conversation among members of the UC, the amendment was not brought to a vote.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 said in an interview after the meeting that he is not sure if O'Connor’s method is the best way to amend the draft and confirmed that a vote on the proposed amendment has not been scheduled.
“We support the creation of an honor code…however I think it’s still up for debate whether or not the UC thinks that a signature or a different medium [works best],” Mayopoulos said.
Brianna J. Suslovic '16 also spoke before the Council to explain why she felt gender-neutral housing, which was passed by referendum this fall, was important and how the UC might help.
Suslovic, who lives in a mixed-gender dorm in Winthrop House, said that the process of getting in a gender-neutral dorm room needs to be made simpler and more transparent.
“People don’t know necessarily know if their houses are or are not part of the pilot program,” Suslovic said.
 
The body did not vote on any specific legislation related to reforming gender-neutral housing procedures, but agreed to assist Suslovic in drafting legislation for the Council.
Afterwards, the UC approved legislation for spring semester grant submissions and elected Charles A. Scherr  '17 and Kate A. Buellesbach  '16 as social czars.
Special Election Results:
Kirkland: Quinn D. Hatoff '15 , Kate A. Buellesbach '16
Mather: Milly Wang ’16
 
Dunster: Sriram V. Pendyala ’15
Cabot: Wentao Xu ’16, Mohammed A. Toure ’16, Tyler W. Creamer ’16
Eliot: Rahul Dalal ’15
Adams:Jordan J.J. Feri ’15
Currier: Rishi Goel ’15
Oak Yard: Luke R. Heine ’17
 
Leverett House: Special Election runoff to be held later this week

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
At the end of January, Stephen C. Rose ’06 shared an Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. quote on his newly-created Tumblr page:  “The mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions.” And according to his younger brother, Evan M. Rose ’09, that quote is symbolic of his late brother’s character.
 
“This [quote] perfectly encapsulates how he was approaching his life and what he wished for others,” Evan Rose wrote in a blog post on his own Tumblr page. “Stephen sought to connect deeply with the ideas he engaged with as well as the people he met.”
 
Stephen Rose, who studied sociology as an undergraduate, jumped to his death from the top of William James Hall on Feb. 6. He was 29.
 
Those who knew him describe Rose as a caring friend with a sunny personality and a deep interest in philosophical issues and say that they hope his death will spark a discussion about mental health.
 
“Steve’s legacy is one of love for his family and friends, kindness to all, deep thought and desire to connect with others despite the obstacles mental illness presented in his life,” Evan Rose wrote in the blog post. Several members of the Roses’ family declined to comment further for this story, offering the post as the family’s statement.
 
Ayodeji B. Ogunnaike ’10, whose older brother was close with Rose, described him as “one of the most pleasant people” at Harvard and someone who was “always pretty willing to talk to anyone about anything.” Even though he knew him primarily through his brother, Ogunnaike said Rose made a point to stop and ask how he was when they ran into each other.
 
“You didn’t have to know him really well for him to take an interest in you and care about you,” Ogunnaike said.
 
Sangu J. Delle ’10, a resident tutor in Adams House who knew Rose as an undergraduate through the Black Men’s Forum, said he has “fond memories” of Rose, adding that Rose would “light up a room with his smile.” Delle recalled having conversations with Rose about philosophy and issues such as racial politics.
 
Delle described Rose as “incredibly brilliant,” “very kind,” and an “older brother” to other members of the Black Men’s Forum. Rose’s death is a “devastating loss to the black community at Harvard,” Delle said.
 
After he left Harvard, Rose had completed a master’s program in psychology at the City University of New York’s City College, according to his LinkedIn profile, and had applied to law school and received acceptances and scholarships, Evan Rose wrote in his post.
 
Evan Rose called for others to share his brother’s story to begin a conversation about mental health and “eventually mak[e] an impact so that other families don’t have to go through the pain of losing a loved one.”
 
“We believe that even in death, his ideals can inspire others to share and connect—both those who are struggling silently to tell their story and connect with others, and for others who are not,” Evan Rose wrote earlier in the post.
 
A Google Form titled “Build Steve Rose’s Legacy,” linked in the Tumblr post, says that his family will start a “charitable effort” in Stephen’s name “to raise awareness around mental health issues.”
 
Rose is survived by several family members, many of whom attended or still attend Harvard. Last Wednesday, members of the Harvard community honored Rose and Angela R. Mathew ’15, who died in a car crash last week, at a vigil at Memorial Church. Administrators including University President Drew G. Faust and Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister were in attendance.

Coming off of a weekend of competing against nationally ranked opponents, the Harvard track and field teams returned to Ivy League play Saturday when they faced Yale and Princeton in the annual HYP meet in New Haven.
 
“It’s a historic rivalry so it’s always a good meet,” co-captain Maksim Korolev said.
 
The women’s team swept the meet, finishing with 69 points—more than 20 points clear of the two other teams. The Crimson won nine of 15 events on the day to clinch the first place finish. The win over Princeton marked the first time the team had beaten the Tigers since 2008-2009.
 
“For our women to win for the first time in five years against Princeton is a great display of our depth and where we’re at with the program,” coach Jason Saretsky said.
 
Junior sprinter Danielle Barbian continued her strong 2013-2014 campaign, leading the pack in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.50 seconds. Though her time was just shy of the school-record 7.48 she ran last week, the junior set a new HYP meet record with the victory, besting her own record she set last year.
 
In the field, freshman Nikki Okwelogu continued to succeed in the shot put. Okwelogu won the event by a large margin—throwing 0.68 meters longer than the runner up, teammate sophomore Adabelle Ekechukwu. The rookie’s distance of 15.02 meters was a personal best and the second best distance in school history.
 
One of the most contested events of the day came in the women’s 4-x-400 meter relay. The Harvard ‘A’ relay team of freshman Haley Baker, senior Olivia Abbate, freshman Sylvia Deppen, and sophomore Madison Hansen beat out the Princeton ‘A’ relay team by only a hundredth of a second, taking the event with a time of 3:52.96.
 
In several events, Crimson runners were competing against their own teammates 
The women swept the top three spots in the 60-meter dash and took the top two spots in the 200-meter dash, the 60-meter hurdles, the high jump, and the shot put.
 
On the men’s side, Princeton maintained a commanding lead throughout the meet—finishing with 89 points to 54 for Harvard and 26 for Yale.
 
The most competitive matchup took place between Harvard and the Tigers, as the Bulldogs were only able to capture one first place finish. The Bulldogs’ lone victor was freshman Marc-Andre Alexandre, who won the men’s 400 meter dash with a meet-record time of 48.01 seconds.
 
Overall, the Crimson took five events, while the Tigers had nine victories. The Tigers dominated the sprinting events while Harvard seniors Korolev and James Leakos buoyed the Crimson in the middle and long distances.
 
“We had some outstanding individual performances and again showed some key strengths,” Saretsky said. “[There’s] a lot of excitement and momentum for the Ivy Championships.”
 
Korolev continued a strong senior campaign, capturing victory in the 1-mile event as he set the meet record with a time of 4 minutes and 2.24 seconds. Leakos was first to cross the line as he participated in the 3000 meter run with a time of 8:08.98.
 
“I had a pacer through the first 800,” Korolev said. “Then I just went. I knew I wanted the win.”
 
The Crimson struggled in the relays Saturday, coming in third in both the 4-x-400 meter and 4-x-800 meter relays, with the Tigers earning first place points in both events and Yale seizing back-to-back second place finishes.
 
In the field, Harvard dominated the weight throw as it swept the top three spots. Junior Ben Glauser won the event with a distance of 19.33 meters while freshman Josh Whitener and senior Dustin Brode took second and third, respectively.
 
The meet brought the indoor regular season to a close, as the Crimson will compete next March 1st at Dartmouth for the Ivy League Championships. This will be the first time since the Dartmouth Relays that Harvard will have more than a week between competitions. Some runners will continue to compete in the week off in order to stay fresh for the meet, while others will use the week to focus on training rather than the stress of racing.
 
“[The HYP meet] is a chance for us to focus on head to head competition,” Saretsky said. “It’s a real perfect stepping stone as we get ready for the Ivy Championships in two weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In more ways than one, it was the perfect end to a perfect season for the No. 1 Harvard men’s squash team (18-0, 7-0 Ivy). In this year’s CSA Men’s National Team Championships, the Crimson handily defeated No. 5 Franklin and Marshall (15-5) on Saturday and No. 2 Trinity (18-2) on Sunday, winning 18 straight matches to take home the Potter Cup.
“I think as a coach…you’re happy for your players, but the word to describe what I’m feeling is probably relief,” coach Mike Way said. “I was happy that it was over because you could sort of feel the tension around the team over the last few weeks…. You want to get on with it. We knew we were good, and [we] just wanted to get [the championships] going.”
Harvard tallied three 9-0 victories this weekend to make a total of 12 sweeps on the year.
“[It was] definitely the best we’ve played all season,” co-captain Gary Power said. “I think it’s something we’ve been building towards. Four years ago we came in fifth, three years ago we came in fourth, and last year we came in second, so it’s something we’ve been working on year by year.”
HARVARD 9, TRINITY 0
In its last contest against Trinity, a win that snapped the Bantams’ 18-season home winning streak, the Crimson dropped two matches in the number six and seven spots. Both freshman Bryan Koh and sophomore Nick Hopcroft were able to redeem their losses with victories in this weekend’s rematch.
Against Koh, the Bantams’ Zevad Elshorafy won the first two games with ease. After the set break, Koh regained momentum and won the next three games.
“It was a phenomenal performance by Bryan,” Power said. “He was getting beaten pretty comfortably in the first two games, but then he sort of changed his strategy and changed his tactics, and beat a kid that he had lost to last time. I feel like that was the moment where I thought we won, so I could absolutely not be happier.”
In the match that secured the title, co-captain Brandon McLaughlin came back from a 2-1 deficit to best Trinity’s Karan Malik for the fifth, clinching win.
“To be honest, I think we were all more excited than nervous,” Power said. “When you feel pressure, you have to view it as a good thing because it means you’re good enough to feel that pressure. I woke up really excited and I really wanted to play a match that mattered, and it felt great to play it in front of all the fans. We love the atmosphere.”
Harvard’s starting lineup consists of five seniors—Ali Farag, McLaughlin, Power, Nigel Koh, and Tom Mullaney—who have waited four years for their chance to be national champions.
“For Gary and Brandon, and for Ali, they felt the deepest sense of responsibility for delivering a result and for helping the team,” Way said. “It’s just awesome for them, and Nigel and Tommy, as well. They’ve all grown as athletes and as men, and they’re ecstatic.”
The national team title was not the only honor won on Sunday. The Skillman Award was given to Farag for outstanding sportsmanship during his collegiate career.
“I thought [Ali] was very deserving,” Way said. “There are always a few athletes in the running, but it would be hard to find a better athlete in college squash, and definitely one who plays with such grace in victory.”
Sunday’s win marks the Crimson’s 31st national title, and its first since 1998.
“There’s that wonderful sense of accomplishment for each athlete when each individual player wins, which I’m very proud of,” Way said. “When I go up and down that list [of players], and I look at how they’ve grown as young men and how they were able to cope with that amount of stress, I just think ‘How can you not be the proudest coach of any sport?’”
HARVARD 9, FRANKLIN AND MARSHALL 0
Saturday’s contest was the first time that Harvard had faced Franklin and Marshall this season. After narrowly defeating St. Lawrence in its last outing, the Diplomats found it hard to grab even a single game from the Crimson, and Harvard ended its semifinal matchup with six 3-0 wins.
“I liked how we matched up [against Franklin and Marshall],” Power said. “The fact that they lost [to St. Lawrence] meant it was an easier semifinal game [for us], which enabled us to be fresher for the final.”

Harvard men’s volleyball (4-3, 3-0 EIVA) outplayed George Mason (4-6, 0-2 EIVA) on Sunday afternoon in its most dominant performance thus far this season. It completed a rare sweep of George Mason and Princeton, two traditional conference powers, to place the Crimson as the frontrunner to dethrone Penn State in the EIVA.
George Mason was blown away in straight sets as Harvard posted a season-best hitting percentage of .390. In the past, the Patriots have had the Crimson’s number, winning both of the past two meetings at the Malkin Athletic Center. Co-captain Nick Madden said it was satisfying to finally best the team’s conference foe.
“[Winning] meant a lot,” Madden said. “We haven’t beat George Mason at home since I’ve been at Harvard and it’s huge to get a win. It was awesome to go out and win in straight games.”
Senior libero and other co-captain Chris Gibbons said he was also particularly pleased to have overcome a team that recently has been one of Harvard’s toughest opponents.
“George Mason is a team that has been really good in the past and has given us some trouble in recent years,” Gibbons said. “They’ve always given us some tough competition so it was really good to get the win against them and go to 3-0 in the league.”
Whilst the sets were close throughout, from the beginning the Crimson established it was the better team on the day. Some strong serving from junior DJ White started the Crimson off in emphatic fashion as it leapt out to a 6-2 lead and never looked back, maintaining a steady advantage as it took the first 25-22.
From there things only got better for Harvard, with the second set—according to Gibbons—arguably the best volleyball the Crimson has played all season. A very fluid and persistent offensive game resulted in a hitting percentage of .682. The offensive potency was combined with extreme diligence and accuracy—Harvard had not a single error in the second set, cruising to victory as the Patriots had simply no answer to the home team’s attack.
Gibbons credited the efficacy of the performance to both excellent execution on fundamentals and a strategy tailored to George Mason’s weaknesses.
“I think that we focused a lot on what we were doing on our side,” Gibbons said. “We were focused on passing well and running our offense in order to take advantage of any weaknesses we had scouted on their side as well as playing defense very well. We got a lot of touches on their hits, blocked really well, and picked up a lot of balls in terms of defensive digs and stuff like that so we just made a lot of plays on our side of the net.”
Madden also noted that exploiting the opponent’s weaknesses was a key to the victory. Often the Harvard service game, a weakness for the team in recent weeks, was able to target poorer defensive players with great success. The Crimson served eight aces to the Patriots’ two during the entire match.
“We served really well and they struggled with receiving because our serves were on point targeting their weaker passers,” Madden said. “Our offense was also in rhythm and just performing at a really high level.”
After the high level of performance in the first two sets, the quality sagged in the third as both teams struggled to get their offenses going. Both teams posted their lowest hitting percentages on the day, with .133 and .167 for the home and away teams respectively.
As the play became sloppier, Harvard relied on their defense to close the game out. Gibbons and White led both team with seven digs apiece as the Patriots could only post 21 digs to the Crimson’s 28. Junior Caleb Zimmick also contributed a valuable five blocks on the day as Harvard scrapped its way to the finish line by 25-23.
George Mason is now back at 0-2 in EIVA play after making the playoffs last year. However, looking forward for the Crimson comes a very difficult back-to-back weekend against St. Francis and Penn State, last year’s league champion.
However, Madden said, if Harvard can perform consistently at the level it did in the second set, there’s no telling what the ceiling might be for the team.
“I think we are positioned pretty well,” Madden said. “Next weekend will be very telling. St. Francis is a lot better than they were last year and is definitely a contender for top four in our league and then Penn State has won our league for the past 18 years. They are the team to beat this year and we’re trying to do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team split two matches this past weekend, earning a win over the University of Rhode Island after falling to Boston College on Saturday. The loss to the Eagles ended a six-match home win streak for the Crimson.
In a contest closer than the score might indicate, Harvard (5-2) fell to BC, 5-2, but bounced back on Sunday to take down the Rams in a 6-1 victory. Some team members were forced to play a spot higher on the ladder this weekend, as freshman June Lee and captain Hannah Morrill struggled with illness and injuries.
“Of course it wasn’t great to have lost to BC, but they’re definitely a tough opponent,” junior Sylvia Li said. “We put up a good fight, and the results didn’t really go our way, but we were able to bounce back to beat Rhode Island the next day, which was really solid.”
HARVARD 6, RHODE ISLAND 1
The Crimson returned to its winning ways on Sunday, cruising to a clean victory over URI (2-3). After struggling in close matches against Boston College on Saturday, the team breezed through its Rams opponents by notching victories in doubles and in five of six singles matches.
“Even though we lost, that kind of gave us more of an incentive to go out there the next day against Rhode Island and get back and redeem ourselves,” freshman Spencer Liang said. “We wanted to win matches and work on things that we wanted to improve on from the day before.”
Liang returned to top form in her second match of the weekend after falling in both doubles and singles against the Eagles. The freshman ace teamed up with classmate Monica Lin to down the Eagles, 8-1, in the first doubles match. Liang then followed up that performance with a dominant win of her own at first singles.
Monica Lin also swept her opponent at second singles to earn her sixth win of the dual meet season. With another victory coming at second doubles from sophomores Amanda Lin and Amy He to give the Crimson the point, Harvard found itself up, 3-0, and on the verge of taking the match early. He would finally clinch the victory for the Crimson at third singles.
“It felt great to finish off the weekend with a win,” Liang said. “We were all proud of ourselves finishing strong. Even though we had unfortunate results against BC, we were proud of the fact that we turned it around and beat Rhode Island pretty handedly.”
The Crimson’s only loss on the day came in the fifth spot, where Li lost a tight match against URI’s Kathleen Uy in a tiebreaker. After dropping the first set, 4-7, Li battled back to take the second in a 6-4 decision but was ultimately outlasted in the tiebreaker, 8-10.
BOSTON COLLEGE 5, HARVARD 2
In a battle between crosstown rivals, the Crimson came out on the losing end on Saturday. The Eagles (7-0) preserved their undefeated record with the win, which came after a match that lasted four hours and was tight from start to finish.
“I think it was definitely closer than the score would indicate,” Liang said. “Sometimes the score doesn’t reflect the play or, of course, the points within each game. In my match, I was right there with [my opponent], and I think on another day the results might have been different. But she was a great player and she deserved to win that day.”
The match was won for BC at third singles, where Jenny Ren clinched the victory with a three-set win over Morrill. The Harvard captain was leading, 6-5, in the second set when Ren ran off 10 points in a row to take the set and seize the momentum.
BC captured the early advantage in the doubles matches, as the Eagles dominated the Crimson at all three positions. Jessica Wacnik and Lexi Borr started the evening off for BC with an 8-4 win over Liang and Monica Lin. Shortly thereafter, a come-from-behind victory at the second position would clinch the doubles point for the Eagles.
Monica Lin evened the match up with an efficient, 6-2, 6-1 win at second singles, but ensuing losses in the first and sixth positions gave BC a commanding, 3-1 lead early in the match. Harvard’s only other win came in the fifth spot, where Amanda Lin swept Heini Salonen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard athletes are accustomed to competing on the national level, but seldom do they have the opportunity to cross oceans and play in international tournaments.
Eric Butorac, a volunteer coach on the Harvard men’s tennis team, did just that this past January at the Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia.
Entering the competition as the no. 48 ranked team in the world, Butorac and his partner Raven Klaasen were in many ways underdogs on the big stage of the Open. Having only played together since October of 2013, the pair was still getting to know each other’s playing styles and had a disadvantage from teams who have been together for years.
“I think we both really have the same understanding of how to play doubles, so we started working together very quickly. We knew going into this year that we had a good chance to play well, and our practices were really good,” Butorac said. “We knew it was only a matter of time before we would have some good results.”
And good results they did have. The pair played 14th-seeded Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Robert Lindstedt of Sweden, a team that has had success in the Australian Open previously. After going down early in the match, Butorac and Klaasen were able to rally back and pull off the upset 6-4, 7-5.
Continuing their winning streak, the team came upon the no. 1 ranked doubles team in the world, Rob and Mike Bryan. Butorac had played them 12 times before and had only came out victorious once before.
This match proved to be lucky number 13. The Bryan brothers quickly went ahead in the match 4-0, to which Butorac and Klaasen rallied back to within 5-4. After a battle on the court that included a 19-shot rally, the team pulled off the upset and advanced to the quarterfinal round of the Open.
“I think what helped us most is that my partner had never played them, so I think he really did believe that we could beat them,” Butorac said. “When we were down I remember him saying to me, ‘We still got this, we can win.’“
The winning ways of the pair continued as they beat both 12th-seeded Dominic Inglot and Treat Huey and the pairing of Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic to move on to the final round of play and a chance for a championship.
Ultimately falling to Lukasz Kubot and Robert Lindstedt in the doubles final, Butorac and Klaasen were still able to return with smiles on their faces and a great sense of accomplishment.
“It feels great,” Butorac said. “Obviously it’s been the best that I’ve ever done in one of the Grand Slam tournaments so that’s really exciting. Also I think it probably felt even better because we beat the number one team on the way to the finals.”
Returning to Harvard to coach his team, Butorac was met by proud student athletes. After his semifinals match Butorac received a video of his players huddled around a computer screen watching their coach play in the international spotlight.
“They were all really excited which meant a lot to me,” Butorac said. ‘I’ve been coaching for four years, so I’ve gotten to know some of them pretty well. Just to see how much it meant to them—it felt the world to me to see that they watched my match and see how excited they were in that moment was a special feeling.”

Despite the piling snow and frozen Charles, the women of Radcliffe crew are feeding their competitive hunger with the help of the World Indoor Rowing Championship, the C.R.A.S.H.-B. Sprints, which took place this Sunday.
Held annually at the Agganis Arena at Boston University, this daylong competition brings together over 2,200 rowers from around the world. Participants compete on indoor rowing machines called ergometers, or “ergs,” that simulate the pull of the water by an oar.
Sophomore Mary Carmack and senior Deva Steketee represented the Black and White at this year’s C.R.A.S.H.-B. regatta. No other members from Harvard’s undergraduate squads competed.
“It’s kind of like the Head of the Charles in the winter,” Steketee said. “It’s kind of a celebration of indoor rowing and the camaraderie behind this really difficult machine we train on. It’s just such a great event because of the community.”
Carmack and Steketee competed in the open division for women in the two-kilometer, which is the standard distance for collegiate rowers in the spring season.  While Steketee came in ninth place at a time of 7:01.2, her teammate followed right behind her at 7:02.0.
This was the fourth time Steketee had competed in this event and the first for her younger teammate. This year’s finish was a personal best for Steketee.
“I told her she should go [to the regatta],” Steketee said. “We’re very competitive in practice, so it was very fun to have her there and push each other.”
“It was fun,” Carmack added, “My favorite part was the atmosphere and it was great seeing so many people from all over the place competing.”
Training for the spring season, the Harvard rowers have been limited to the indoors and practice on the ergs. The women who did not participate in the C.R.A.S.H.-B. event had to complete the 2k as a fitness test the day before.
“We’re indoors every day on the erg putting in long hours, trying to get faster,” Steketee said. “That’s where we’re at as a team.”
The duo did not travel across the river alone. With them came their assistant coach, Wendy Wilbur, who in addition to coaching the Radcliffe, is a member of the Board of Directors for the C.R.A.S.H.-B sprints.
Wilbur did not start rowing until her junior year of college when she transferred to the University of Massachusetts. Five years later, she made her first national team.
“It says something about the sport,” she said. “If you have the right body type and the physiology and the mindset also, you can become very good very quickly.”
Her success transferred to the indoor championship, which she recalls was always her best performance. When she competed in the mid-1990s, before the NCAA changed its rules, there was an event called the “mixed collegiate double”. In this race, each college sent its top male and female rower to compete as one combined team. In 1995, she and her teammate finished in first, and two years later, she returned to place fourth individually.
“I always loved the environment,” Wilbur said. “I wanted to give back and provide the same for the new generation coming through the pipeline.”
With the help of the Radcliffe freshmen heavyweight rowers volunteering at the event, the 2014 C.R.A.S.H.-B. regatta ran, in Wilbur’s eyes, seamlessly. Four world records were broken, including three in the adaptive division.
The energetic atmosphere of Sunday was a change of pace for the off-season training. According to Wilbur, the Black and White rowers are itching for warmer weather and looking forward to getting back on the water.
Competing in her last C.R.A.S.H.-B regatta, Steketee shared what she will miss the most.
“Erging has a maniac quality to it,” she said. “You really have to go out there and put your body on the line. You know what’s coming, you know you’re going to hit that wall, but everyone is there, they’re there for the pain, and we’re all kind of enjoying it together.”

 Apparently Yalies have been suffering from an unusually large amount of heartburn—or at least, they’re interested in treating it. 
The New Haven Register reported in an article yesterday that the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute invested $100,000 in Tummyzen, an antacid created by Eli Nutrition, Inc. Eli Nutrition, Inc. was founded by Yale School of Management students Hasan Ansari '14 and Yulia Khvan '14 and Yale College student Faisal Hamid '13. The Yale Entrepreneurial Institute set up the YEI Innovation Fund in September 2013 to provide funding to promising startups founded by Yale students.
"People are eager for new solutions," Ansari said in an interview with Yale News, "We are on our way to changing how America manages its heartburn." It is admirable that the founders of Eli Nutrition Inc. want to help people suffering from heartburn, but Flyby can’t help but suspect this is part of a larger problem at Yale. Perhaps Yalies' hearts have been burning with rage for Harvard students since 2006, the last time they won the Game. 
 Nevertheless, it’s heartwarming that the Yale administration is willing to donate so much money to help the suffering students in New Haven. Get better soon, Yale.
College is expensive. Institutions ask for tens of thousands of dollars each semester to cover tuition, room, and board. However, these figures alone do not entail the entire financial burden of being a college student, as there are numerous other costs associated with being an engaged, successful student that are not represented by the advertised college expenditures. These “hidden” costs of college can easily total into the thousands of dollars every year, adding to an already stressful financial situation. As an incoming or new college student, it’s important to realize these costs.
In order to get a better understanding of what you may be spending money on, here are the top five expenses for college students as suggested by the undergraduates across the Ivy League and other selective institutions around the United States:
5. Clothes
Some would argue that it’s important to be stylish, so keeping up with the latest fashion trends is imperative. Some people add to their wardrobe on a regular basis, and with a shirt or pair of jeans easily costing more than $30 at most trendy stores, it is very easy to spend way too much on clothing.
Even more than fashion, buying clothes is important for those students who come from a climate different than that where the campus is situated. Here in the Boston area, students from southern California were perfectly comfortable for the first few months of classes, but as soon as this terribly frigid winter arrived, many scrambled to the stores in search of so-called “parkas” and “snow boots.”
And if a heavy-duty down jacket can’t keep you warm…
4. Alcohol
The average student would likely tell you that no real college party is complete without some sort of alcohol. Although alcohol for one night may not cost too much, with partying and drinking every weekend, the total cost over a semester can be quite significant. While not every college student drinks, many of those who do probably make up for it.
It may not surprising that alcohol showed up on this list, but some may be shocked that one shameless Cornell University student even admitted to spending more on alcohol every semester than on the rest of the items in this list combined.
3. Outings
When the weekend hits and students are sick of being holed up in class all week, many choose to head into the city. Before long, the cost can really pile up—taxi, dinner, tickets/entry fees, and so on. Even if the event is relatively inexpensive, other associated costs can double or even triple that cost. For those who grew up in a rural setting far from taxis and fancy restaurants, these additions costs is one of the biggest surprises of city living.
Several of the students I interviewed highlighted the importance of public transportation and under-used college-affiliated shuttles to help reduce the cost of weekend or evening outings. Many institutions even have special deals for students, but these opportunities tend to be poorly advertised. If you look, you may be able to find special deals to professional sports events, art museums, and theatrical productions.
2. Food
The allure of an “unlimited meal plan” may seem incredible for a hungry incoming freshman, but chances are that he’ll soon realize the limitations of dining halls. First and foremost, when you have a 9:00 class, there will be little motivation to wake up before 8:55, so eating breakfast is out of the question. At the end of the day, most college students are up well into the wee hours of the morning, long after the dining halls have closed.
Some colleges have meal plan options that do not include three meals every day of the week, so students frequently supplement the meal plan with Ramen noodles, dry cereal, or some other easy-to-prepare dorm food. Having an ample stash of food in the dorm is incredibly convenient for a quick meal or snack while working without having to leave the dorm.
Dining hall and dorm food really is not that great, so going out to eat once in a while is a common escape for some--or as one Harvard freshman put it, “a nice break from chicken and squash.” Restaurants in most college towns and cities are going to be ridiculously expensive, so be prepared to spend quite a bit more than you’d expect elsewhere.
1. Textbooks
Buying textbooks is, by far, the most traumatic experience for a college student’s wallet. Several students interviewed reported spending over $400 for textbooks for this semester alone. If you think about that, over eight semesters, that’s over $3000 spent on books for coursework.
Editors love to pull the “new edition” trick: pulling older versions of the book from the shelves and replacing it with a newfangled, rearranged next edition. With the ever-increasing use of digital textbooks, this is likely to become less of an issue in years to come, but for now, it is still a major expense and cause for anxiety among students.
