After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 7, 2014, at 2:23 p.m.
Pforzheimer House resident Andrew Sun ’16 died at about 4 a.m. Monday morning at Massachusetts General Hospital, a little over 24 hours after he jumped from a building in downtown Boston.
Pforzheimer Co-House Masters Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant broke the news of Sun’s death in an email to the House community shortly before 8 a.m. Monday morning.
In an interview with The Crimson shortly after, Harrington said that, “Very sadly, from all we understand at this point, this was not an accident.”


Sun underwent surgery Sunday morning at the hospital for “extremely serious injuries” caused by the fall,  College spokesperson Colin Manning said Sunday. By Sunday night, Sun was on life support and was not expected to recover, according to an email sent shortly after 8 p.m Sunday by Pforzheimer House acting Resident Dean Gabriel A. Katsh '04 to House tutors.
“I’m writing with the sad news that Andrew’s doctors said his injuries are too severe for him to recover. He is on life support but likely only has a matter of hours left,” Katsh wrote in his email.
On Monday morning, that prediction proved to be true. According to the email from Harrington and Durant to the Pforzheimer House list, Sun’s father, mother, and aunt were present at the hospital when he died.
“We are all of us grieving today,” the co-masters wrote in their email.
 
Harrington told The Crimson that she was woken up 1:30 a.m. Sunday by a phone call from Katsh with the news and held an emergency meeting for Pforzheimer tutors and contacted Sun’s blockmates. Harrington visited Sun in the hospital later that day, and said about 25 students also went to see him.
“People kept coming and coming, and they went in tears,” Harrington said. “I was so moved and proud by the maturity they shared in their grief.”
Officer Rachel McGuire, a spokesperson for the Boston Police Department, confirmed that the incident occurred at 240 Atlantic Ave. near the New England Aquarium in the Seaport District of Boston, but said the department would not disclose further information.
Sun, an Economics concentrator from New Jersey, was a member of Harvard College Faith in Action, according to group member Ruby S. Almanza ’16. He was also an inactive member of the Harvard Financial Analysts Club, according to club president Kevin A. Sun ’15, who is of no relation.
On his LinkedIn profile, Sun listed that he was an intern at Xela Capital LLC, a Seattle-based investment planning firm, as well as a former research intern at Columbia University.
In lieu of Pfoho’s planned Open House Sunday evening, Harrington and Durant  invited community members to  their residence at 9 p.m. to share their feelings and and “gather strength from each other,” Harrington wrote. Echoing Harrington, Katsh wrote in another email to the House list that students should not hesitate to seek out resources and support from House tutors, as well as other students.
Additionally, Harvard College Faith in Action held a prayer and worship event open to all members of the community in room P14 of the Student Organization Center at Hilles at 7 p.m Sunday.
“It was really powerful,” Shaun Y.S. Lim ’15, president of HCFA, said of the prayer event.  “It was a great show of support for each other and also for Andy. It’s a tough time for the community.”
Harrington and Durant have opened their residence today once again to all community members who wish to talk. According to their email, they will also host another gathering in their residence for the community to share feelings and memories of Sun.
At around 9:30 a.m. Monday, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister sent an email to the Harvard community about Sun’s death.
“Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Andrew's family, friends and all of Pforzheimer. This is a tragic loss for our entire community,” Pfister wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The annual Identities Fashion Show showcased high fashion and celebrated diverse identities on Saturday night.
Seventy-two student models strutted down the runway throughout the evening, sporting designs by fashion vendors from eight countries.
The hour and a half show—described on its website as “a celebration of the cultural and intellectual significance of fashion at Harvard”—was produced by 20 students who spent an entire year working to iron out every detail.
Many students who worked on Identities said that the program offers a valuable look at a world that Harvard rarely sees.
“I feel that Harvard is so focused on creating doctors, lawyers, and bankers that there is not enough large-scale productions in the arts beyond theater at Harvard,” said Executive Producer Jack Pretto ’14 . “Fashion is actually on the minds of a lot more students than usually thought.”
 
According to Executive Producer Whitney T. Gao ’16, Identities sets itself apart from the other fashion shows at Harvard by its focus on high fashion.
“Whereas Eleganza is more performance-based, Identities is more similar to a traditional fashion show, like the fashion weeks at Paris, New York, and London,” Gao said.
Many models said they not only appreciated the traditional fashion show vibe, but also enjoyed how Identities brings together an eclectic group of people.
“I love the idea of a show that celebrates all kinds of body types and all kinds of people, and all kinds of crazy fashion. It brings creative energy to Harvard,” said Monet S. Clarke ’16.
Another model, Kunho Kim ’17, completed his catwalk in a wheelchair.
“I got to contribute to the production process, which was really fun,” Kim said. “The models felt like they made the show with the board, which makes it such a memorable experience.”
Identities debuted in 2006 and featured models wearing their own clothes or low-budget costumes from H&M, Pretto said. But this year Identities showcased haute couture garments designed by professionals from Paris, New York, and London.
Many designers whose works appeared in the show flew from overseas to attend the show.
“This is just as good as Paris, if not better,” said Holly Fowler, a London-based designer whose dresses were showcased during Identities.
Members of the audience also noted that they appreciated how the show attempted to bring Harvard students in touch with the fashion world.
 “I really like the exposure to fashion that I otherwise would never see. The models are all doing a really great job,” said Bari C. Saltman ’14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Now that the madness of March has run its course, the spring sports season is finally upon us. At last, the baseball and softball diamonds are clear of snow, the bubble over Harvard Stadium has come down, and the weather is—well, almost cooperating.
Oh, the times, they are a-changin’, and there is plenty going on around the Harvard sports scene. But fear not, the athletes still have found ways to stay active on Twitter in the meantime. As always, here at The Back Page, we couldn’t let them go unnoticed. Enjoy!
5. As previously mentioned, the weather is only close to actually cooperating, and, after having a double-header against Cornell cancelled over the weekend, baseball’s freshman left-hander Kevin Rex understands the struggle.
“Games played: 0, hours on Peter Pan bus: 20+”
If going to Ithaca in the first place wasn’t bad enough…
4. Freshman men’s hockey forward Tyler Moy has come up with a new and effective way to ace papers.
“You know you're a student-athlete when you're taking pre-workout to write an essay ‪#SHAKESpeare”
Whatev’r it dost taketh to procure a satisfactory mark.
3. Maksim Korolev, a senior men’s track star, was certainly in good spirits on April 1.
“In honor of April Fools' Day, I will walk around as Borat. Retweet this by the end of the day, I will send you a personalized Borat Vine.”
We sure are going to miss you when you head to Stanford, Max.
2. One question just can’t seem to get off the mind of senior wrestler Anthony Zonfrelli.
“Do little Chinese kids dig holes to America? I gotta know”
If they do, wouldn’t they cross paths with their American counterparts halfway down?
1. John Rose, a senior midfielder for the men’s lacrosse team, tops our list as he may be well on his way to blowing up the internet.
“Thinking about starting a match making website for old people called Carbon Dating ‪#science”
Remodeling “love at first swipe” for the technologically impaired. Brilliant.

The Back Page takes a step back from the NCAA tournament bracket madness to reconnect with some Crimson alums from years past.
He’s Got Heart: Desmond Bryant ’09
 
A little over a year ago, Crimson sports alumnus Scott Sherman covered Bryant’s new contract with the Cleveland Browns. Since his multi-million dollar contract, Bryant has been busy; after recording 31 tackles and 3.5 sacks in 12 games in his first season with the Browns, the former Crimson star underwent an emergency medical procedure in December to correct an irregular heartbeat.
With his career on hold, Bryant worked hard to return to his former strength. Just a few weeks ago, the defensive end was given full clearance to return to full football activities. He is currently preparing to make a full comeback to the Brown’s starting defensive line.
The 6’6” Bryant turned town offers from Duke, Florida A&M, and Towson to come to play for the Crimson, and he became a key starter on the perfect 10-0 2005 Harvard team that was led by fellow future NFL player Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.
After the promising start, Bryant ran into some trouble and was suspended from the team twice, first for violating team rules and then for academic reasons. He returned for his senior year, though, recording 4.5 tackles for a loss and was granted second-team Ivy League honors.
Undrafted coming out of Harvard, Bryant got his chance with the Oakland Raiders as a rookie in 2009, recording 32 tackles in 16 games. Since then, the 310-pounder has found continued success in the NFL, recording five sacks in his third year and four in his fourth year.
Harvard Ice Hockey Legend: Julie Chu ’06-07
 
It’s not often that you find an athlete that competes at the Olympics before he or she sets foot on a college campus. But for Chu, the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics were just the start.
After this year’s Olympic games, the 5’8” international ice hockey superstar now has three silver medals and a bronze to her name. She was also voted by the Team USA captains to be the US flag bearer at the Sochi closing ceremonies just a few months ago.
Chu has competed at almost every women’s ice hockey level possible, from the NCAA to the Western Women’s Hockey League to the Canadian Women’s Hockey League.
Among the dozens of accolades littering Chu’s ice hockey resume are the 284 points and 196 assists she scored in her four years playing for the Crimson. Both put her at the top of the NCAA record books. She was a four-time All-American at Harvard and earned the Patty Kazmaier Award as the best collegiate hockey player in the US in her senior campaign.
In what may have been her final Olympic games, Chu was reunited with her former coach, Katey Stone, who is in her 19th season as coach for the Crimson.
Freshman Frank and the Quest for Belonging: Frank Hermann '06
 
In a slight change of pace and in a nod to the start of baseball season, I’d like to take a look at Hermann’s career—not necessarily just because he is one of 15 Harvard baseball players to make it to The Show—but also because of the intriguing, self-reflective writing he did for the Crimson a few years ago when he was a prospect in the Cleveland Indians’ organization.
In a portion of what turned out to be a nine-part diary back when he was playing minor league ball, Hermann wrote:
“I am now at the point where I am trying to balance the initial shock of brushing shoulders with my former idols and convincing myself that I belong. Each day I‘ve been here, I’ve had that moment of realization when I say to myself, “What am I doing here?” Most of us experienced that feeling when we walked into the stately confines of Annenberg or saw our name alongside “Harvard University” on a letterhead.”
It’s not often that you find a first-year player with the maturity to write so eloquently about the professional sports grind and that is also a Harvard graduate. It can be easy to forget that for every pro athlete that has made it to the biggest stage, there’s at least a dozen trying to get there too.
But that’s enough philosophizing for The Back Page, so let’s get back to Hermann. The 6’4” right-hander made it to the bright lights of the big leagues, turning in two-plus solid seasons as a relief pitcher for the Indians before missing the entire 2013 season due to Tommy John surgery.
Hermann has run into some trouble in this year’s spring training, giving up six runs in just under two innings of work. Even with the rocky start, Hermann still remains on the Indians’ 25-man active roster and hopes to earn a spot in the bullpen after the year of recovery.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a tale of two teams for the Radcliffe crew teams on Saturday, as the lightweights triumphed over Georgetown with a sweep at home while the heavyweights failed to win a race against Brown in Providence, R.I.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe lightweights displayed their comfort on the familiar waters of the Charles on Saturday as the team swept the visiting Hoyas with wins in the varsity eight and varsity four.
The boat of eight for the Black and White finished with open water over Georgetown to win the Class of 2004 Cup, posting a time of 7:31.3, more than 30 seconds faster than the Hoyas.
In the varsity four, Radcliffe entered three boats against a single Georgetown squad, and all three boats for the Black and White finished ahead of the Hoyas.
“I am just very, very proud of our entire team,” captain Andrea Linares said. “I think it says a lot about us to come in and have the 1V have a very decisive win over Georgetown and have our three boats finish first, second, and third in the 4V.”
The Radcliffe B boat earned the victory with a time of 8:42.3, edging out its teammates in the A boat who finished four seconds back at 8:46.9. The Radcliffe C crew crossed the line next with a time of 9:09.2 as the Hoyas brought up the rear and finished with a mark of 9:21.0.
“This is only our second race, so we are still very early in the season,” Linares said. “I think each boat has stuff that they need to work on, particularly the starts and the sprints at the finish. Knowing we have a lot to work on is a great thing because we have a lot of time on the water to improve.”
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe heavyweights began their season in Providence on Saturday against preseason No. 9 Brown. The closest race of the day came in the first varsity eight, where the Bears edged the Black and White for the victory with a winning time of 6:21.80.
Radcliffe finished five seconds behind with a time of 6:26.80.
This year marked the second consecutive season that the Black and White’s first varsity eight has dropped its opening race to the Bears.
“Brown is renowned to be very fast off the line,” junior stroke Eliza Flint said. “They are also a team that will fight to the very end. We came in knowing we needed to be fast off the line and powerful through the water to really execute our race plan. All our boats performed well. However, unfortunately, Brown came out on top.”
Radcliffe’s second varsity eight, which earned a victory over Brown last year, was unable to duplicate the result this season as the crew dropped the race to the Bears on Saturday.  Brown’s win was never in doubt, and the Bears finished with a commanding 20-second lead over the Black and White for an overall time of 6:34.90.
It was much of the same for the Radcliffe third varsity eight, which finished with a time of 7:19.90, a full 16 seconds behind Brown’s third squad.
In the varsity four races, Brown showcased its depth on the way to two more victories over the Black and White.  The Bears’ first varsity four finished with a time of 7:35.30, once again beating a Radcliffe boat by over 16 seconds.
Perhaps more impressively, Brown’s second varsity four crossed the line with a time of 7:42.10, just seven seconds behind the top boat for the Bears. The second varsity four for Radcliffe actually beat its first boat by two seconds, finishing with a mark of 7:49.10.
“We figured out [this weekend] that we need to gain more speed,” Flint said. “For the first varsity boat, we have nailed down the specific part of the stroke that will gain us that speed which is great. This week we are going to put a huge emphasis on improving that part of the stroke.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Senior Night at the Malkin Athletic Center, the Harvard men’s volleyball team clinched an Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association playoff spot with a four set victory over Saint Francis (10-13, 5-6 EIVA). For five graduating seniors, Saturday marked the final time they would play at home for the Crimson (13-7, 9-3 EIVA), and despite a few uneven patches, they went out proud with a win.
“There were a couple of lulls here and there, but for the most part, we were playing strong,” co-captain Chris Gibbons said. “It’s a big win for us because now we’re qualified for the playoffs, so now we can really focus on that.”
The first set was an offense-heavy affair for both sides as the two teams posted hitting percentages over .400. A 5-1 run boosted Harvard midway through the set, and the home team never looked back, holding on to take the set 25-19.
The Crimson offense remained potent through the second set while the Red Flash stuttered. Harvard’s defense took control of the game, led by the trio of freshman Nick Bendell and co-captains Nick Madden and Gibbons. With the visitors’ offense stifled, junior hitter DJ White took full advantage on his way to a game-high 15 kills on only 26 attempts. The set was never in doubt and ended in Harvard’s favor, 25-16.
“On the whole, we were passing pretty well, and our energy levels were high,” sophomore Branden Clemens said. “It felt like we were gelling as a team and our team chemistry was up.”
It felt like it was all going to be over in three, but then it was the visitors’ turn to impress. A mixture of a lapse in concentration by the Crimson and an increase in intensity from Saint Francis resulted in a blowout set win for the Red Flash, 25-18. The team that dominated the opening two sets struggled to put rallies together. Suddenly an upset was on the table.
“We had a little mishap in the third set where we lost focus a little bit and it seemed like we couldn’t put a ball away,” Clemens said. “But we really stepped things back up for the fourth set.”
After the scare that was the third set, the Crimson went out on a high in the fourth. Saint Francis was held to a lowly hitting percentage of .034 and struggled to get through the home defense. The entire set was a one-sided affair and at 24-16, senior bench player Will Chambers had his champagne moment, spiking the game-winning kill.
Aside from Chambers, the four other seniors, Gibbons, Madden, Michael Owen and Kyle Rehkemper, have all started since freshman year. For Gibbons, Saturday was a fitting farewell to his home court.
“We’ve played a lot of matches here in the MAC,” Gibbons said. “Some wins, some losses, but it’s nice to end on a win. It was a lot of fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pitching and defensive woes plagued the Harvard baseball team all weekend, leading to four losses against Ivy League opponents Penn and Columbia at O’Donnell Field.
The Crimson (5-18, 1-5 Ivy) allowed at least seven runs in every contest and committed a combined 11 errors, leading to 13 unearned runs.
“Coming into [the weekend], we knew we were a game back,” junior outfielder Mike Martin said. “It seemed like all the other Ivy League teams were pretty similar…. Our mindset was to win four. When it comes down to it, we didn’t play well together as a team.”
COLUMBIA 8, HARVARD 3
In the final game of the weekend, Harvard dug itself into an early hole and suffered an 8-3 defeat at the hands of the visiting Lions (11-15, 5-3).
Harvard senior starter Sam Dodge only lasted 2.2 innings on the hill, allowing four runs on four hits and two walks. After four Crimson arms struggled in game one, it took five different pitchers to get through the nine innings.
Adding to the labors of the Harvard pitching staff, three Crimson miscues on defense led to three unearned runs.
Senior outfielder Carlton Bailey had the team’s only extra base hit of the day and scored a run. Martin also provided a bright spot of his own, going 3-for-4 at the plate.
But the four through nine Crimson hitters couldn't get their bats going, recording just two hits on the game.
COLUMBIA 12, HARVARD 6
While the Crimson struck first for the only time of the weekend, the pitching staff could not find a way to avoid the big inning, as Harvard saw a 4-0 lead become an 8-4 deficit in the top of the fifth inning. The Crimson couldn’t recover and fell to Columbia, 12-6, in the first game on Sunday afternoon.
It was a pitch-by-committee sort of day for both squads, with neither starter finishing five complete innings, and Columbia’s Joey Donino throwing only three.
Looking for his first win of the season, freshman right hander Nick Gruener began the day strong, limiting the Columbia lineup to just one hit through four innings of work.
But then the wheels came off on the defensive end in the top of the fifth, as Crimson infielders committed two errors that led to three unearned runs.
The Lions continued their offensive onslaught after they knocked Gruener out of the game, scoring seven more runs off sophomore Nick Scahill and freshman Kevin Rex to put the game out of reach.
Though Harvard walked eight times to go along with its six hits, the team stranded 10 runners on base in the game.
“Early in the first game, at least today, we played well,” Bailey said. “One play turns it into a different ballgame. Basically [we need to] zone in to every play instead of taking a play off, a pitch off.”
PENN 9, HARVARD 6
After dropping the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader, the Crimson found itself tied with the Quakers after five innings of play in the rubber contest. But Penn (15-10, 8-0) scored a combined six runs in the final four frames to secure the sweep by a score of 9-6.
Six different Harvard pitchers took the hill in the game. Junior starter Matt Timoney surrendered just two earned runs in six innings, but the team’s relievers could not stop the Penn offense in the later innings.
The Crimson tied the game with three runs in the bottom of the fourth after three Harvard hitters singled to begin the inning. Penn infielders helped the Crimson’s cause by committing two errors in the frame.
Harvard’s top three hitters—Bailey, co-captain Kyle Larrow, and Martin—registered a combined seven hits on the game. But despite out-hitting the Quakers, 11-9, the Crimson struggled to move runners around and left 10 men on base.
PENN 7, HARVARD 3
With two innings left to play in the first game of the weekend, the Crimson appeared to be in control. A three-run fifth had given Harvard a 3-1 lead over the Quakers, and the team’s ace in sophomore Sean Poppen returned to the mound.
But nothing went right for the Crimson after that. Penn scored three times in the top of the sixth to take back the lead, and the visitors tacked on another trio of runs in the next frame to secure a 7-3 victory.
The decisive sixth inning saw the Quakers string together three consecutive singles to load the bases with no outs. Just minutes later—after a fielder’s choice, a sacrifice fly, and a squeeze—all three runners had crossed the plate, Poppen had been removed from the game, and Penn had taken a lead it would not surrender.
Harvard’s big inning came in the bottom of the fifth, highlighted by an RBI double from Bailey off the wall in center field. With two knocks, Bailey was the only Crimson player to register more than one hit in the game.
“We came into the weekend trying to do something big and show everyone that we can compete,” Bailey said. “We dropped the ball a few times and didn’t get key hits when we needed to. It just didn’t work out for us this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wrapping up its regular season at Bucknell, the Harvard women’s water polo team (13-16, 2-3 CWPA South) went 1-2 on the weekend, dropping two contests to Brown and the Bison before defeating Mercyhurst.
HARVARD 13, MERCYHURST 6
In the team’s lone win of the weekend, the Crimson offense dominated in the pool and led from wire to wire.
Harvard seized a 5-1 advantage early in the contest and never looked back. Quick goals from freshman two-meter Melissa Balding started the scoring for the Crimson, which would see six different players find the back of the net over the course of the four quarters.
By halftime, Harvard found itself winning, 8-2. The Lakers (9-11, 0-4) scored three goals in the third quarter, but it would not be enough to bridge the gap.
Sophomore attacker Yoshi Andersen led Harvard with five goals, while Balding ended the day with three. Andersen also led in assists and steals, tallying two and four, respectively.
“Overall, this was a good way to get exposure to the good teams that we will be playing next weekend at the Southern Championships and the weekend after,” freshman attacker Lexi Del Toro said. “We have a chance to see what our competition is going to be like later on.”
PRINCETON 8, HARVARD 4
Saturday marked the second time this season that the Crimson has matched up against the Tigers (25-1, 4-0), who sit atop the CWPA South. The last time the two teams faced off came on March 2, when Princeton prevailed by an 11-9 margin.
With only one loss this season, the Tigers are currently tied for the ninth spot in the NCAA rankings.
It took the Harvard offense a while to get going, as the team was shut out in the first quarter. On the opposite side of the pool, the Tigers executed a consistent attack, scoring two goals in the first and second quarters.
By halftime, the Crimson was down, 4-2, but the team managed to rally coming out of the break and tie the game at four. For Harvard, those goals would be its last, as Princeton went on to strike four more times en route to the win.
“We always have a fun game against Princeton because it’s always really competitive,” junior co-captain Ariel Dukes said. “I think everyone really stepped up and played as hard as they could, so I thought it was a good game.”
Freshman attacker Michelle Martinelli, Del Toro, Andersen, and junior attacker Victoria Frager rounded out the Crimson’s offense with one goal each.
Dukes made three steals while in goal and stopped seven shots. Sophomore attacker Rachel Lobato, Balding, and Andersen each contributed a takeaway.
BUCKNELL 7, HARVARD 6
In a tightly contested battle that came down to the final seconds, the Crimson could not come up with enough offense late to close the gap against Bucknell and settled for a 7-6 loss.
The Bison (9-11, 2-2) went on the attack first, scoring the game’s opening goal 2:15 into the match. Junior attacker Kalina Grabb answered for Harvard, only to have Bucknell score back-to-back goals at the end of the first quarter.
Before the first frame could finish, however, Martinelli fired a shot past Bison goalie Rena Heim to bring the Crimson within one with eight minutes to go in the half.
In the second quarter of play, both defenses turned their play up a notch, with neither team scoring a goal in the period.
“Our coach always says this is a game of inches, and we have been losing a lot of really close games,” Del Toro said. “So I think we really have to work on having the intensity to win those close games and push through. We’ve worked so hard this whole season; it’s just a matter of applying it to games.”
In contrast to the stalemate that was the second quarter, both offenses came out roaring after halftime. Balding scored the game-tying goal for Harvard, and a strong offensive push from the Crimson allowed sophomore Andersen to come up with a goal that gave the team its first lead of the day.
But the lead would not stand long, as the Bison answered Andersen’s goal with three straight scores of its own, which would ultimately be enough for the victory.
“I think a lot of it is communication and not being frantic,” Dukes said. “We have to play a lot more relaxed in order to have success, especially going forward into the postseason.”

The Harvard men’s tennis team kicked off its Ivy title defense this weekend and immediately faced tough tests against No. 19 Columbia and No. 46 Cornell.
The No. 34 Crimson (12-6, 1-1 Ivy) had an uneven road trip, getting blanked by the surging Lions (16-1, 3-0), 7-0, on Saturday, before turning things around against the Big Red (10-7, 0-3) Sunday afternoon.
Columbia, undefeated in conference play, represents perhaps the biggest obstacle to Harvard’s three-peat chances.
“Yesterday was a tough loss, but [the Lions] are very good on their home courts,” junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “They are playing well and are tough to beat, but anything is possible in Ivies.”
HARVARD 5, CORNELL 2
Harvard skillfully handled both the brisk Ithaca early-spring weather and Cornell to hand the Big Red its third straight conference loss.
In doubles, the Crimson jumped out to a 1-0 lead, marking a turnaround after having to play from behind on Saturday. Sophomore Nicky Hu and freshman Brian Yeung closed out a 8-6 win, and the team’s top tandem of co-captain Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen followed suit with an 8-5 mark to hand Harvard the advantage.
“We haven’t won a lot of doubles points this year against the really good teams,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “Today we played some good tennis and got back on track.”
In singles, Steinroeder did the early damage, cruising to a 6-2, 6-2 win. Freshman Andrew Ball then fell at No. 6 to make the match score 2-1.
Yeung proceeded to crush a serve on match point on the fifth court to finish off a two-set win and bring the Crimson to the precipice of victory. Junior Shaun Chaudhuri would seal the deal, coming back from a set deficit to close out the win in three.
Freshman Sebastian Beltrame picked up a victory, but Nguyen lost in a third-set tiebreak to make up the final 5-2 score.
“Our job going forward is focusing on our matches and not worrying about how other teams are doing,” Steinroeder said. “We did a great job of doing that today, bouncing back with a great, hard-fought win.”
COLUMBIA 7, HARVARD 0
In its first foray into Ivy League play, the Crimson attempted to avenge a 4-0 defeat at the hands of the Lions in the final round of the ECAC Team Championships in February.
But things didn’t go as planned for Harvard in its first test at defending its Ancient Eight crown, as Columbia dropped the Crimson, 7-0, in a match that was much closer than the final score indicated.
In doubles, Yeung and Hu went down on the second court, 8-4, but the other two matches were tightly contested. Beltrame and junior Christo Schultz fell just shy on court three, 8-7. In the heavyweight battle between No. 11 MacMaster and Nguyen and Columbia’s No. 12 Ashok Narayana and Max Schnur, the hosts came out just ahead, 8-7, and the Lions took the early 1-0 lead.
In singles, Harvard came out strong, winning the first set at the third, fourth, and fifth positions. But Beltrame was the first to go down, falling 6-2, 6-0 on court two. The rest of the five singles matches would go three sets each, but the Crimson didn’t come away with any victories.
Ball lost on the sixth court, 6-1, 5-7, 7-5, and then Chaudhuri fell at No. 3, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, to officially give Columbia the four points it needed for victory. Steinroeder suffered defeat on the fourth court before the other two matches were stopped to give the Lions their 7-0 final margin.
“We lost a close doubles point,” Steinroeder said. “We fought very hard in singles and had a lot of close matches, but came up short in all of them.”
As the Crimson progresses through what promises to be a tightly contested Ivy schedule, it must learn to bounce back. Many matches are scheduled as weekend doubleheaders, and according to Steinroeder, the team needs to have a short memory if it falters in the first match.
“[The Cornell] match really showed our resiliency after losing [Saturday],” Steinroeder said. “We’ll have to use that same resiliency going forward with the rest of our season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby team traveled to State College, Penn. this weekend to take on the toughest opponent of its 2013-2014 campaign. The Crimson (7-4) was set to face off against No. 1 Penn State, the defending national champions, in a Saturday afternoon match.
Besting the eight-time national champions would prove to be a tall task for the injury-hampered squad. Harvard had several key starters out due to injury, but nonetheless held its own in a 50-12 loss to the Nittany Lions.
“The score doesn’t reflect the amazing effort that the whole team put in,” junior field captain Helen Clark said. “I think that the team played really tenaciously. Everyone was just contributing really great effort and just playing with a lot of heart.”
The Crimson entered Saturday afternoon’s contest already with several starters on the sidelines. But by the end of the afternoon, two more costly injuries would cut into Harvard’s lineup.
In warm-ups, co-captain Ali Haber was sidelined with a badly sprained ankle. Then, less than fifteen minutes into the game, fellow co-captain Xanni Brown, the Crimson’s leading scorer, went down with a broken leg. The injuries were a devastating blow for the Crimson.
“It’s always really heartbreaking to see your teammates get injured and to have to play without them,” Clark said. “But that really motivated us to play for each other. Whenever a teammate goes down, it just feeds into that motivation even more.”
The Crimson was down a pair of tries less than ten minutes into the contest before a try by junior Cheta Emba cut into the deficit. Senior Shelby Lin added another try in the second half, capping off Harvard’s scoring efforts.
“I thought we did really well, especially considering the circumstances,” co-captain Brandy Machado said. “It was a little tough at the beginning of the game, and we saw people getting a little bit down. But we came back, [and] especially in the second half, started performing a lot better. I’m really proud of what the team did.”
“We do have a very deep bench,” Machado added. “We have a lot of our rookies playing in their very first games and they’re doing great, so I’m really excited to see them play more. Because we have the young talent that we do, I think we are in a good place, even when we do have games like this where we do have a lot of injuries and people on the sidelines.”
The Crimson intend to use the loss as a key learning opportunity as it prepares for the national championships in just three short weeks. By then, Harvard hopes to have a few more of its veteran players back in the lineup.
“[The game] showed us where our weaknesses are and what we need to work on,” Machado said. “We were tested a lot more than we have been in any other game. We’re going to be working really hard in practice and our next game to improve on those things. We fought the whole game. I think the biggest takeaway for the team is that we can play against these teams and hold our own.”

 “When you get elevated, / They love it or they hate it / You dance up on them haters / Keep getting funky on the scene” are Janelle Monáe lyrics that you’ll certainly hear more than once the day of Yardfest. To provide you with the tools to tip the tightrope, here are some drink recommendations to get you through your Yardfest pre-game:
 
The Classy Affair
Required: André and Orange Juice (or any other type of fruit juice). 
  Starting that Sunday morning off right may be a struggle. To wake up, mix some André and orange juice in your tumbler, which is totally meant to be for iced coffee, and get rowdy. It may not be a mimosa worthy of The Charles Hotel, but you’ll feel hella classy getting tipsy off champagne on an empty stomach.
 
The Mixologist
Required: Rubinoff, Cranberry Juice, and Sprite
  Everyone has that friend that claims to be an amateur mixologist. Yardfest is a prime time for them to show their skills. When carefully combined, the sprite and cranberry juice completely (or mostly) eliminate the disgusting taste of Rubinoff. Pour it all in a water bottle and take it to go so you can enjoy Janelle while getting your drank on.
The Morning Adjustment
Required: Coffee, Whiskey, Sugar, and Cream.
Some of us need to start off a Sunday with caffeine. And no, a traditional alcoholic drink is not a valid substitute. Introducing: Irish Coffee. Brew your black coffee as normal, but leave a little extra room in your mug – for the whiskey and sugar you will mix in, and a layer of liquid cream poured on top. Enjoy this two-for-one drink while it’s hot!
Be safe, and drink up!

The realm of Harvard celebrities boasts computer science geniuses, iconic American family members, and most importantly, the Harvard Class of 2017 Facebook group stars. These internet personalities were able to spare us a moment of their busy lives to have a talk with us about their online fame. Class of 2017, we all remember the unforgettable posts of Gabby D. Aguirre ‘17, Gabriel L. Guimaraes ‘17, Luka Kordić ‘17, and Stephen A. Turban ‘17.
Flyby: What first motivated you to start posting in the group, and did you ever anticipate stardom?
GA: “No I didn’t actually anticipate stardom. Actually, I got in regular decision so by the time I joined the group, the famous people were already established, and I was like, ‘I gotta keep up with them,’ so I started trying to be cool and witty. I saw people who were getting like 60 likes on their comments and I was like, ‘I gotta step my game up.’ And it happened.’”
ST: “Literally, before I came, I made it a goal for myself to become active on the Facebook page. I've always been really bad on social media, and I kind of wanted to be good at it.”
GG: “Did you write it down [in your notebook]?”
ST: “Yeah, I did. It was an idea. It was like ‘I'm going to try to post something everyday, and make it good and interesting.' I wanted to be a presence. And yeah, I did anticipate stardom.”
LK: “I was bored. I mean honestly, I could say I wanted to connect with people, but no. I was just bored. I took a gap year, and it was my second gap year already and I was running out of things to do. This was my hobby. Did I anticipate stardom? Of course. I could play the false modesty card, but yeah I posted a lot and it’s not like I’m even a star in the good sense. But I’m a star, I’m famous. People stop me in the street—you know, old people, young people, mothers with their kids.”
GG: “People on Facebook were having lots of meet-ups and stuff, but since I’m from Brazil, I didn’t really get to have those things. I felt more at Harvard through the group. And there’s no such thing as stardom.”
LK: “There is, actually. Whenever I say Gabriel, I don’t have to clarify. Everyone’s just like, ‘Oh, Gabriel.’ You’re a star.”
ST: “You know what’s funny, though? I knew Gabriel for a while before I connected him to his Facebook photo.”
GG: “Really?”
ST: “You’re also like the most photogenic person I know.”
GG: “That’s not true.”
LK: “That is true.”
 
Flyby: How was it introducing yourself when you actually moved onto campus? Did people recognize you?
GA: “At least 15 to 20 people that I met on the first week were like, ‘Oh, I know you from Facebook!’ or people would be like, ‘Oh, I already know you!’ so it was a little bit awkward. When I first meet someone, I should just be able to say like, ‘Hey, I’m Gabby!’ but it got disrupted because people already knew me.”
ST: “I definitely expected there to be a funny dynamic when I got on campus. I didn’t realize how many people were not active on Facebook, but read all the posts—lurkers.”
LK: “Lurkers, yeah.”
GG: “People wanted to take pictures with me in the first few weeks of school. They said, ‘Oh my God, you’re Gabriel, ah!’
LK: “I’m kind of sad no one wanted to take pictures with me.”
Flyby: How has posting in the group been since you’ve actually started school?
GA: “Since I started going here, I don’t actually post as much because I feel like a lot of people just post about events or extracurriculars on campus, but I’m not really involved in any of those things so I don’t really post as much. I try to still ask people about their winter breaks or spring breaks just to see what people did, but people just don’t reply.”
ST: “I think the dynamic of the group was that it was much more democratic at first, and then as the summer went through, it kind of funnelled into a couple of people, and then now, we’re nothing.”
LK: “I say things like Happy Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Hanukkah, and stuff like that.”
GG: “Now the group is just advertising.”
LK: “Craigslist.”
 
Flyby: Do all of you guys know each other, and is there a Facebook celebrity friend group?
LK: “We all know each other, but there isn’t like an exclusive and elitist group. We’re not like that.”
GA: “I know Luka and Gabriel. I met Stephen like once because he needed my ID for some reason, so I let him borrow it. I don’t know, it was really creepy. I feel like a lot of the Facebook celebs are friends. I think there are groups, and then other ones that are like me that are kind of normal now, like they’re reintegrated into normal people life.’”
ST: “I made a couple of really good friends through the Facebook page.”
GG: “This was a really big thing for me. I felt like I had friends way before school started. And then me and Luka for example, it was funny, when we met, there was no introduction needed. He was standing in front of Weld, and we just screamed, ‘Oh!’”
LK: “Yeah, it was pretty primal, I guess.”
GG: “Yep, and now we’re blocking together.”
Flyby: What do you think about being deemed a “Facebook celeb”?
ST: “I think it’s hilarious.”
GA: “I think it just shows the extent to which I have no life, because if I’m cool enough to be a Facebook celebrity, it means I’m not doing anything in my actual time, I guess. It’s not like I’m going to wherever and doing something like Habitat for Humanity, I’m just on Facebook.”
GG: “It was interesting that ‘Facebook celebrity’ wasn’t a thing before we got on campus. So before, when we were just posting on the Facebook group, there was no such thing as a ‘Facebook celebrity.’ There were just people that were more active on the group.”
 
Flyby: If you could do it over again, would you want to be a “Facebook celeb”?
GG: “Yeah.”
ST: “Yeah.”
LK: “Maybe…yeah I guess.”
GA: “Maybe not, because I feel like people were expecting me to be cool and witty in real life and I’m not as cool and witty in real life. So I feel like I built up people’s expectations a little bit too much.”
 
Flyby: How would you describe your Facebook persona, both on your personal profile and in the Class of 2017 group?
GA: “I guess when I post in the group, I try to get to know everyone and keep up and be witty. I think on my actual Facebook, I either post music a lot or like try to be funny. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn’t.”
GG: “Luka’s kind of bad-ass on the Facebook group.”
LK: “Yeah, you’re right.”
ST: “I don’t wear a bowtie online.”
Flyby: Do you have any advice for the Class of 2018 Facebook celebrities?
ST: “Connect with us, we will bump up your posts. And also, telling them it’s all about the long-term commitment—it’s about the marathon, not the race.”
LK: “It’s all about supply and demand, as long as there’s a demand for it. Thank you, Professor Mankiw.”
GA: “Get ready for everyone to say, ‘Oh, I know you from Facebook.’ Like don’t be like shell-shocked. Also, try to make sure that if you’re funny on Facebook, you’re funny in real life.
Flyby: Do you have anything else you'd like to say?
ST: “Thank you to my mother for training me to become a Facebook celebrity.”
GG: “I would like to send my thanks to my family as well.”
LK: “I think we should all take a moment of silence for Promit Ghosh.”
ST: “Yeah, we would all like to send our love to Promit Ghosh, and we’re sad that he could not be here today.”
