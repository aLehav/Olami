There is nothing straightforward about “Three Easy Pieces”, a solo exhibition by Japanese-British artist Simon Fujiwara that opened Oct. 23 in the Carpenter Center: the “ease” of the show lies not in the casual nonchalance the title may suggest but in its confession-like integrity and approachability, strengths that enable a range of viewers to appreciate its multilayered yet unresolved nature. “’Three Easy Pieces’ implies each work is interdependent and part of a whole,” curator James Voorhies remarks. “But it also suggests that many ideas are continually developing here and that one should not try to take the work too seriously.”
The show combines sculptural, video and performance elements to tell a vivid narrative that examines broad social and political issues such as racial and gender inequality through an introspective, personal lens, one that engages the viewer by constantly redefining the boundary between the real and the imagined.
“Rehearsal for a Reunion” is perhaps most typical of Fujiwara’s style, both in its use of multiple media and in its exploration of both personal and universal themes. The first part of the piece, an installation, is at first eye-catching for its rawness: it consists of pieces of broken pottery next to a table whose tea set and pen and paper imply the viewer has just missed a tea get-together of some kind. Equally unfiltered is “Letters From Mexico,” which consists of framed typewritten texts that chronicle the artist’s trip to Mexico. Each letter, which recounts Fujiwara’s personal adventures in the country, has been transcribed phonetically by urban Mexicans.
Perhaps the piece most emblematic of Fujiwara’s style is “Studio Pietà (King Kong Komplex)”.  The multimedia piece won Fujiwara his spot at the Carpenter Center, where he now has his first solo exhibit in the United States. “I first saw ‘Pietà’ at the Andrea Rosen gallery in New York,” Voohries recalls. “I was hooked, so I decided to invite Simon over here.”
Part video, sculpture and voice, “Pietà” features a staged interview with the artist and a mysterious interlocutor in which he discusses his memory of a now-lost 1960s photograph of his mother being carried in the arms of a Lebanese boyfriend at a beach in Beirut, where she worked as a cabaret dancer. Haunted by the image, Fujiwara decides to restage this photograph in the present by hiring actors to play his mother and her boyfriend, an enterprise that forms the premise of the video.
The video shows the clips, interviews, and trials that form the raw process of this reenactment, the physical evidences of which form the remaining portion of the piece: at the foot of the screen sits the swath of pebble-strewn beach on which the narrator filmed the actors, and at the far end of the room are sundry tokens of the filmed interview, such as the cups and water bottle from which the artist drank. Surrounded by the visual, auditory, and tangible manifestations of the video, the viewer’s senses indicate that Fujiwara’s endeavor to recreate the photograph actually took place. However, the narrator never produces the image, which leaves the viewer wondering if the mysterious photograph actually existed or if the very premise of the video was imagined.
For Voorhies, this ambiguity underlies the magnetism of the piece. “‘Pietà’ throws us in a thrilling state of suspension…. We can walk around, see the physical evidence, but still ask ourselves, ‘How much of this is true?’”
Another source of fascination that “Pietà” offers is its treatment of broad social and political topics, one that is especially palatable because rather than being forced upon the viewer, it is a natural and relevant offshoot of the artist’s personal experience. During one of the trials of the artist’s reenactment of the photograph, the mother carries the boyfriend, while the narrator questions the use of swarthy males and fair females in the media, a situation he defines as the “King Kong Komplex.” The interviewer brings these political questions back to the artist himself, asking him if he is attracted to the man he chose as the actor of his mother’s boyfriend. The artist never answers this question—at least not vocally. Instead, the camera follows water droplets, which the narrator used to simulate ocean spray, as they travel down the actor’s face and chest. Fujiwara’s initial attempt at self-discovery thus fluidly expands into an exploration of such universal themes as exoticism, racial profiling, and sexual identity.
For all its far-reaching intricacy, however, the video’s presence is free of rigidity and encourages free interpretation. For one, the video does not have a clear beginning or end: instead, the viewer can enter at any point during the video. “There is no clear ‘resolution’ in [Fujiwara]’s work. It is inconclusive on purpose,” Voorhies says. “And that’s what I like most about it.”
As Fujiwara sees it, the video’s cyclic fluidity can be attributed to an even more practical reason: “In our society of information, we always feel like we have to follow every fact,” he says. “But in my work, you can dive in whenever you’d like: you as the audience choose how long you want to watch it for, and, more importantly, you don’t have to experience everything.”

"Let Me Be Frank With You," Richard Ford’s soft-spoken quartet of novellas about old age in winter, is a book of uncommon grace and resonance. 70-year-old Ford has appointed his longtime friend, literary creation, and mouthpiece, real-estate agent Frank Bascombe of the “Sportswriter” trilogy, to narrate all four stories; since Frank is now 68, only two years younger than Ford himself, this is as much his swansong as his maker’s.
Frank’s wanderings in the novellas all take place over two weeks in December, post-Hurricane Sandy. On these self-described “pilgrimages” through suburban New Jersey, meeting others and their troubles, Frank salvages “the accumulations of life,” as he puts it, from the wintry wreckage. His efforts are a kind of gathering of snow. In a sense, so are Ford’s: each “pilgrimage” occurs a few days after the one preceding it, deftly building in more echoes and layered meanings, and the book that emerges is a handsome shrine of redeemed final moments.
Ford is a subtle artist and a subtler moralist. He knows how to make each novella on the surface a linear narrative about Frank’s day,while suspending underneath it a network of redemptive impulses. In the first, “I’m Here,” the hero fails to commiserate with an old acquaintance who lost property to the storm. “There’s nothing I can do—the familiar dilemma for people my age,” Frank muses grimly. He smiles at his own impotence but is saddened by its implication: life’s sunken pearls can’t all be found again. Yet in the end, one still must “do” something: “So what I do—an act of pure desolation—is hug Arnie back, clap my arms around his leathery shoulders and squeeze, as much to save myself from falling,” Frank says. It is token solidarity, not  the real thing, expressed. But it is a move in the right direction, beautifully executed by Ford.
A similar charade ensues in the third episode, “The New Normal,” when Frank comes to see his terminally ill ex-wife and old quarrels resurface. “Don’t presume the past. Be nice,” he tells himself, upon hearing a particularly shattering comment from his ex. The second story, “Everything Could be Worse,” and the fourth, “Deaths of Others,” also make revelations that threaten to shatter Frank: his current home was the site of a brutal double-murder, and his ex-wife cheated on him years ago with his now-dying friend Eddie. For good or for worse, he absorbs the shocks. Time has insulated him. Yet on the way out from Eddie’s, his heart is pierced by a chance exchange with a kind man asking after his son on Christmas Eve. The words come out wrong; the man misremembers Frank’s son. But here again, like in the story of Christ’s arrival to the world on Christmas day, a great saving has been accomplished.
Even the book’s title—with its implied promise of an exchange opening between two parties in late-life, a “Me” and “You,” and the weary appeal in the words “Let Me Be”—faintly hints at this yearning to heal. Ford never preaches through Frank, whose idiosyncratic voice, full of crackling warmth, wisdom, and dry humor, maneuvers ever tastefully above the precarious line of the judgmental: “There’s no right way to plan a life and no right way to live one—only plenty of wrong ways,” Frank says. Yet for all his hands-off moral relativism, he is modestly articulating what he feels is the right way to live: “What’s there is not to be missed or pissed away in a blur,” he says. For him, the “right way” is to notice life, bear witness to it, and contain it in our gaze.
“Let Me Be Frank With You” is wary of endings even as it describes them, or rather describes the asymptotic approach to them: Frank detests “the ‘c’-card, abominable closure,” as he calls it. In a way it doesn’t feel like the book has either started or stopped; the episodes all flow into each other, a linked ring of events. Paralleling this, rather than being declarative and explicit, Ford’s style is lyrically understated. He will have Frank utter things like “Silence is the best defense against non-entities—let them become insubstantial, like a retreating fog.” His laconicism points to silence, though obviously, writing is by nature non-silence. Instead, Frank’s prickly, knowing, elegiac voice approximates the unsayable with his sparse murmurings. He looks at Arnie and thinks: “I’m here. He’s here. But, in another sense, we’re not.” There is no explanation of what the other sense is; there doesn’t need to be, since all that isn’t in the sentences—the sense of not being “here,” that “the rest is silence”—has been conjured up by what is in fact there.
Absence, omission, and forgetting turn out to be the true center of the book; there is no external destination to be striven for, no climax and ending to be buttoned on this tale. It is really this beauty of getting nowhere, like seeing the snow fall faintly through the universe in James Joyce’s “The Dead,” that Ford most exquisitely portrays in the book. Frank has come to the end of the road but doesn’t mind trotting in place, even offering himself as fodder for entertainment. His is a measured review of life’s blows, a last-minute sewing-up of open wounds, a drinking of dregs, a salute to the darkness, and a restrained, never self-pitying study of a man’s life, in a voice paradoxically tentative yet assured. Most of the time, the wise assuredness assures us too.

One simple, elegant equation that explains everything in the universe.
That’s what Stephen Hawking is after in “The Theory of Everything,” a feature film that inhabits both drama and biopic, both romance and realism. Hawking, known as much for his battle with ALS as for his groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, defied countless expectations in his ongoing search for that equation, becoming an icon—both medical and academic—in the process. According to the cast and crew, however, Hawking’s untold stories are perhaps the ones most worthy of portrayal.
“I think of it as a triple helix,” writer Anthony McCarten said at a press conference in New York on Oct. 18. “There’s these three movies in one: the physics story, the love story, and then there’s the physical, medical story. And if they could be woven together, we would have a shot at doing something a little bit unprecedented.”
It’s a tall order, and one that made similarly unprecedented demands of the cast and crew. “That was a challenge for us all: to try and reckon with the nature of Stephen’s scientific achievements,” director James Marsh said. “To do so, you have to engage with the biggest questions that there are—the origins of the universe—and at a certain point you’re pondering these things in a hotel room on your own and you say, ‘Well, I’m gonna have a beer and listen to some pop music.’”
Those aren’t the only big questions “The Theory of Everything” investigates: after all, it was the love story of Jane Wilde and Stephen Hawking that first intrigued McCarten, and it was the unique emotionality of the narrative that allowed the cast opportunities to explore capabilities.
“What I loved about making this film, which I hadn’t experienced to the same extent with other projects, was this complete jumping-into a character,” Felicity Jones, who plays Hawking’s wife Jane Wilde, said. “It’s the most extraordinary experience when you let go of yourself.”
For Eddie Redmayne, who plays Hawking, many of the role’s particular demands entailed a new physicality and new methods of expression, especially after his character loses the ability to speak. “You take all of those colors [that] as human beings we normally have—physicality, voice, and all of those things, and…channel that energy into the little that you do have,” he said.
The cast worked extensively with the real-life Hawking family to facilitate Redmayne and Jones’s character research, Redmayne even recalling an instance on set when Jane Wilde herself styled his hair. “It was quite surreal, at moments,” Jones quipped.
But it was the tangible reality of the story and people they were portraying that both grounded and inspired Redmayne and Jones, particularly in the many emotionally fraught scenes of the film. “For both [Jane Wilde and Stephen Hawking] the emotional stakes were so high that the emotion…always came quite easily,” Jones said. “We realized that they had actually gone through this: they were in these profound situations.”
Marsh found that the most effective directorial decision to make in those situations was to simply step back and watch. “In a sense you just want to keep out of their way,” Marsh said. “I think the most rewarding aspect of this film was the way the actors worked with each other and off each other.”
“They should have a category for leading actors in a duet or something,” McCarten agreed. “That’s what these guys had, they had a chemistry and a magic that inspired each other.”
And that magic had to be maintained in the face of the unconventionalities and ups and downs of a relationship that was inevitably altered by Hawking’s diagnosis and the later stages of ALS. “I wanted [to tell] this very unusual love story, where A meets B, then A with the permission of B meets C, and B with the permission of A meets D,” McCarten said, joking about his use of equations. “And it’s still a love story that you can completely buy.”
An equation that explains everything? Perhaps not. Still, it’s one that produces a complicated and compelling portrait of a man who, along with his family, created, not accepted, a path that allowed him to keep moving through the fabric of the universe.

Why do audiences have an enduring obsession with crime movies? The Mafia has given way to cartels, triads, yakuza, and post-Soviet brotherhoods, but there is still a cinematic fascination with organizations and individuals that exist outside and against the law. “John Wick,” a high-octane revenge fantasy directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, goes a long way towards giving us an answer.
John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a hitman who has reformed his life after marrying Helen (Bridget Moynahan). When Helen dies, he is plunged deep into depression. His wife’s last gift to him, a beagle puppy named Daisy, is the only thing that gets him out of bed every day. Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the son of Wick’s former boss Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), breaks into Wick’s home, beats him bloody, steals his car, and kills Daisy. The enraged Wick sets out to settle accounts.
The writing is as over-the-top as one would expect and hope for a movie about Keanu Reeves killing people for murdering his dog. Dialogue is simple, sparse, and well-punctuated with laugh breaks, full of utterances that would populate speech-bubbles in comic books. “John Wick’s not the boogeyman,” says Viggo at one juncture. “He’s the man you send to kill the fucking boogeyman.”
The acting matches the screenplay. Expressions and line delivery are cartoonish but effective. Leading man Reeves’s lines are short and few, maximizing the effect of his peculiar, breathy technique, the oddity of which tends to grate heavily during long monologues. Nyqvist’s Viggo is simple but relatable, a man whose son has made a grave error but who wishes to protect him all the same.
Leitch and Stahelski have both worked extensively as stuntmen, and as a result it is no wonder that the movie’s action sequences are superb. The stunt choreography is brutal yet surreally graceful—Wick moves in exactly the way one would expect a top hitman to move. The camerawork and editing manage to convey the complicated happenings without the visual confusion that is typical of so many modern action films. A sequence in which Wick chases Iosef through a nightclub is especially notable: strobe lights highlight the distinct expressions of fear and desperation on Iosef’s face and the panicked motions of the surrounding clubgoers. Shaky cam, generally the cancer of modern cinema, is used sparingly and subtly.
The movie’s weaknesses are inextricable from its strengths. This is a movie about people killing each other. It has no frills and no pretensions. Clever dialogue and labyrinthine plot are not the point of “John Wick,” and anyone coming to it with an expectation of cerebral stimulation will be disappointed. This is an old-fashioned revenge movie in a slick, modern-Hollywood body, and on those terms, it is incredibly successful.
And this idea—revenge—is why gangster movies still resonate with us. The underworld is a place where there is still a possibility of getting real satisfaction from one’s enemies, where real justice is still possible. Civil society is supposed to enforce equal justice, but deep down, we are lingeringly afraid that the system will not work for us, and the wrongs done us will go unpunished. We would all like to be John Wick: able to take vengeance for ourselves, unimpeded either by the bureaucracy of the law or by our own weakness.
Perhaps “John Wick” is not high art, but it does not aim to be. It is successful for what it is: a stark reflection of one of our most closely-held fantasies, the dream that we could thrive on our own strength, skill, and luck, the dream of self-sufficiency in an uncertain universe. Delivered in a sleek package, this resonant and unembellished theme makes “John Wick” one of the most satisfying films this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The World Series ended last week, the culmination of a season that has been dominated primarily by the retirement of Derek Jeter.
There were a slew of commercials this year that served essentially as tributes to Jeter, including one produced by the Jordan brand that first aired halfway through the season during the All-Star game.
In that commercial, Derek Jeter steps up to the plate at Yankee Stadium; as he sets his feet, Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester tips his cap as a mark of respect; the move spreads. An array of people—a young kid in Brooklyn, other athletes like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, a vendor selling crackerjacks, Yankees fans of every age, gender, and race, police officers and firefighters, Rudy Giuliani, even Red Sox fans—each tip their caps.
Of course, the clip is a commercial, meant to promote Jeter’s brand and Jordan’s shoes sales. It’s all a bit hokey and rather clichéd and very much contrived. But the ad nevertheless speaks to a higher truth—it’s not simply a tribute to Derek Jeter the player, but also baseball the sport; the commercial illustrates the immense power of sports to bring together people from all walks of life.
To some, watching sports is in some ways a waste of time—after all, it is a poor source of new information, fails to increase productivity, and rarely teaches deep or meaningful lessons.
But for others, sports provide an arena for people from all walks of life to come together and bond over a shared love. I often talk and joke with the fellow fans I sit next to at Fenway Park or Gillette Stadium. I have chatted with old men in Germany about soccer and with students in Australia about cricket. Sports provide a common language, a common experience, a common interest between people who are otherwise linked by nothing else. As Nelson Mandela once said, “It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does.”
However, we lack that common link here at Harvard. At the moment, none of the primary bonds that connect students at Harvard are universal. We are united by our houses, by teams and clubs, by our classes—but these are all distinctions which we share with at most a few hundred other students. There is no thread that binds us beyond the name of Harvard itself.
And as powerful as the name may be, it’s not enough. We can be proud of the name on the front of our sweatshirts and we can respect the institution which it represents, but it is much more difficult to love a mere word or the intangible idea that inspired it. There is no focal point for us as students to center on—no tangible, physical, human embodiment or representative of the school that can serve as a common object of support and love.
The seeds for such a centerpiece already exist at Harvard. Even though Lavietes Pavilion seats only 2,195, President Faust has reportedly labeled home games at Lavietes for the men’s basketball team as “the most diverse event on Harvard’s campus.” But the student section still numbers only a few hundred for each home game; the transcendence at these basketball games only extends to those who are already interested in basketball. At its fullest potential, the football or basketball team could draw bigger, more diverse crowds, acting as a symbol of the school, one that engenders pride and affection.
There are of course reasons to be wary of an athletic department that overshadows the rest of the university; the perils of major sports at American colleges are well documented. But perhaps it is time now to lift the ban on postseason play for Ivy League football teams. Despite the consistent inclusion of the Ancient Eight’s football teams in Top 25 polls of all FCS teams—the undefeated Crimson is currently sitting at 17th in the FCS Coaches Poll—Ivy League teams have never been allowed to participate in postseason play.
Moreover the primary reasons that are cited as continued for the ban—academics and tradition—have failed to prevent Ivy League teams from competing in the postseason of other sports. In fact, the football team is the only one of Harvard’s 42 varsity teams that is currently prohibited from postseason play. Given the desires of athletes, coaches, and even the former president of Brown to see Ivy teams in the playoffs, the continued ban seems to primarily stem from the stubbornness of the current university presidents.
The benefit would extend beyond extra games for the football team: seeing those Crimson jerseys competing on a national stage can provide a sense of pride, a bond different from anything that currently exists. A part of me yearns deeply for Harvard sports teams that can inspire excitement and passion from the students, consistently fill stadiums, and unite the entire diverse student body behind a common cause. The possibility of such teams exists, particularly with football—it has the potential to be about so much more than just wins and losses for all the students at Harvard. And it is time to realize that potential. Lift the ban.

Last Sunday, the United Nations released its latest report on climate change, highlighting the myriad dangers posed by global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Synthesis Report—published in Copenhagen on Nov. 2—conveys alarm and urgency, noting that the status quo could lead to “severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.” Moreover, the report emphasizes some of the far-reaching consequences of climate change, particularly the potential flooding of coastal cities and increased hunger and poverty. Credit must be given to the U.N. for bringing attention to these concerns.
It is clear that climate change is increasingly becoming not only an environmental issue, but also a geopolitical issue, posing a threat to international order akin to chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons; the international community would do well to treat climate change with the necessary degree of seriousness and make a more concerted effort at solving this problem.
The threats posed by climate change are evident; in fact, the effects have already been felt in various places around the world, such as the dying of vast swathes of forests in parts of the western United States or the rapid rate at which the oceans are rising. Climate change is also beginning to negatively affect global food production and exacerbating issues of poverty. These threats’ multi-headed nature, not merely rising sea levels but geopolitical implications too, only reinforces the need for action.
With the U.S. among them, 114 countries have acknowledged a temperature rise of two degrees Celsius as the threshold of dangerous climate change in 2009. There are no signs of stopping. At the same time, despite the IPCC’s recommendation to end the use of fossil fuels without carbon capture by 2100, there are only eight large scale carbon capture and storage operations currently in operation. That is a symptom of broader shortfall in funding to combat climate change.
Meanwhile, spending has remained robust in the other direction. Fossil fuel energy companies currently invest $600 billion each year simply to find more sources of coal, petroleum, and natural gas, whereas research to reduce with energy emissions receives less than $400 billion annually. These priorities must be reversed: Funding must be increased to develop economically sound strategies for the reduction of fuel emissions. Possibilities include new, more efficient means of generating energy, as well as more sophisticated methods for carbon capture.
There are other possible solutions as well, including the implementation of treaties that have actual binding power on fossil fuel emissions. The fact remains that, regardless of the solutions chosen, action must be taken. The implications of climate change shown in the report are drastic, and without strong efforts to curb carbon emissions, these detrimental changes will become a frightening reality.

There was no subject line to the email. Theory: Subject line-less emails from people who’ve been staring at your tits in writers’ meetings are almost always going to be shady. We’ll call this the Gattuso Conjecture.
The message read: “Want to stick around for a bit after the meeting to discuss comping and other things?” Corollary to the Conjecture: The phrase “other things” in shady subject-line-less emails basically always means sex.
The email-sending boob starer was my comp director: the guy who decided whether I was good enough to pass through the comp process to become a member of the publication for which I was trying out. I didn’t want him. I wanted to be a writer. But I was afraid: I was too public-school, too small-town, not enough hand-rolled-cigarette. So when he started creeping, my dread of encountering him at meetings was tempered with excitement: He thought I belonged. I wasn’t attracted to him, but I would have fucked him to feel that.
Let’s take sexuality as more than that collection of weird, naked gyrations some of us engage in as foreplay to Netflix. Let’s think about sexuality as a collection of ideas about bodies and their interactions with other bodies, a collection of ideas that helps determine who hangs out with who, who goes out, who comes out. Our social contexts structure and are structured by sexuality in ways that include or exclude, empower or marginalize: Who’s hot enough to be in the Fly? Which English concentrator has the cutest nerd-chic boyfriend? In a community as predicated on exclusivity as Harvard, this raises some ethical questions: Who does sexuality exclude? And if sexuality functions as a price of social entry, how do we think about consent?
There are a bunch of ways, besides just our choice of who, if anyone, to sleep with, that sexuality structures our interactions.  Sexuality is often part—however overt or subtle—of comp processes, punches, and initiations; that is, of social processes that determine who is in and who is out. In one of the organizations I’m involved with, for example, new members used to find out they had gotten on through a prank phone call telling them they first had to hook up with the board leader. In another, initiations involved the public pronouncement of which members I wanted to have a threesome with. If you’re not into making sexual declarations in front of a room of drunk randos, that experience might leave you feeling pretty alienated.
Or how about the date event. If you’re punching or rushing, it matters whether you and your date are desirable: socially and personally, but sexually as well. Besides the ickiness of being judged by normative sexy standards, this can be exclusionary. A lot of people in social clubs, for example, feel comfortable bringing same-gender dates to events, but a whole hell of a lot don’t. And it’s not that people in clubs are scary and homophobic; it’s that being a minority is freaking difficult, and if we don’t make huge, concerted, affirmative, constant effort to be inclusive, we end up leaving people out. When we don’t question whose sexuality is valued and whose excluded, who is valued and who is excluded, we create hierarchies of human worth. That blows.
Predicating social inclusion on sexuality also raises some serious questions about consent. In human-subjects research, there are limits to the kinds of rewards you can offer people for their participation. Promise people too great a reward, the argument goes, and conditions become coercive; if it’s really, really hard to say no, it’s not a very ethical yes. Get an MRI and $3,000, or listen to your deathly fear of MRIs and don’t participate? The answer is obvious. Similarly, social groups that predicate feelings of acceptance and community on sexuality make it harder for all of us to make decisions about sex. Put up with one or two sexualized comments and be recognized as a Harvard Writer, or leave the comp process? It wasn’t much of a choice.
Let’s think critically about how we experience sexuality during times when community is created—during punch, rush, comp, and initiations. Let’s ask ourselves: Do we say things that assume everybody to be cisgendered or heterosexual, or that assume everyone is or should be interested in sex? Do we actively welcome members and punches to bring dates of whatever gender, to bring friends as well as partners? Do we make comments about people’s clothes or how many chicks they’ll bring into an organization, or whether or not we think they’re hot? Are initiations sexualized? How?
I’ve fucked for love, and I’ve fucked for pleasure, and I’ve fucked in those moments of tenderness for the body that make you weep in gratitude that you exist. I’ve also fucked for social approval. At a place like Harvard, sometimes it’s hard to know which feeling is which. And that’s okay. But what we can do is make that not-knowing a little gentler. Let’s reframe consent as a collaborative process: as something we build constantly and together; as the very substance of what it means to belong.

Princeton has entered a resolution agreement with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights after the office found the university in violation of the federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
The agreement, announced by the Education Department Wednesday, follows a years-long investigation into Princeton’s Title IX compliance in response to complaints from three students filed between 2009 and 2011. The agreement requires that the university work with OCR to ensure future adherence to the law.
According to a letter from OCR to Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber detailing the office’s findings, OCR’s investigation determined that Princeton had not adequately responded to some sexual assault complaints and that the university “allowed for the continuation of a sexually hostile environment” for one student complainant.
Princeton’s previous policies governing sexual harassment, in particular, violated Title IX, according to the letter. Princeton implemented new sexual assault policies this summer in response to government pressure, according to The Daily Princetonian. Those policies updated the university’s standard of evidence for adjudicating sexual assault complaints from “clear and persuasive” to “preponderance of the evidence,” the OCR-preferred standard.
According to OCR’s letter, Princeton’s change in policy “corrects many of the deficiencies identified in the
University’s previous sexual harassment [policy], including sexual assault/violence, policies and procedures.”
OCR is currently investigating two Harvard schools—the College and the Law School—after receiving complaints alleging that their handling of sexual assault violates Title IX.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students in an undergraduate anthropology class presented their findings on Thursday after they spent the fall term excavating the remains of the Harvard Indian College, a 17th century school for American Indians that was affiliated with a young Harvard University.
This is the fourth year students from Anthropology 1130: “The Archaeology of Harvard Yard”  have worked in this section of the Yard. After discovering the foundation of the Indian College in previous digs, students said on Thursday that the discovery of a “clay cap” basement structure could shed new light on life at the school, which was erected in 1655 and dismantled in 1698.
“This is the first time we’re seeing the interior of the building in any kind of expansive way,” said Adam Stack, a teaching fellow in the course. “When we start corroborating [the results] with historical evidence, we might learn a lot more about how the actual construction of the building took place, what might have been going on inside…these are details that are not recorded historically.”
Over the course of the semester, students also found artifacts of 17th century life at the College, including pieces of smoking pipes, glass from bottles of alcoholic beverages, and silver cufflinks.
Both faculty and students said they were pleased with the results of this year’s dig.
“Our goal was to identify archaeological context relating to the Indian College, or at least the 17th century,” said Patricia Capone, curator and director of repatriation at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and lecturer on Anthropology. “I think we’ve achieved those goals.”
“The results have been incredible,” said Matthew C. Gschwend ’16, adding that he may pursue a secondary in archaeology after taking the class. “This has been one of my favorite classes at Harvard,” he said.
The class is part of a collaborative effort between the Anthropology Department, the Peabody Museum, and the Harvard Native American Program that aims to discover more about the early history of Native Americans at Harvard.
In place of a more traditional section in the classroom, students in the class meet for three hours every Thursday to work on the archaeological site.
Thursday’s event drew a number of interested spectators, including a 6th grade social studies class on a field trip from the Glen Urquhart School in Beverly, Mass. Undergraduates and faculty members, who have worked in pairs on the dig that began in September, cycled between presenting discoveries from their respective areas of the site and continuing to dig.
Like the course itself, Thursday’s event was hands-on, allowing participants to personally examine the artifacts, despite the rain.
“This class really sets Harvard apart, in that you have the opportunity to get your hands dirty and actually do the archaeology yourself,” said John B. Holland-McCowan ’15, a student in the class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the last ten years, Harvard has made headlines with a bold plan to build a massive engineering complex in Allston, but it has also been working—quietly and methodically—to lay a different type of infrastructure across the river. This initiative focuses on behind-the-scenes collaboration rather than press conferences, and on developing apps rather than developing property.
Founded by graduates from the Business School, the Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics is a newly minted city department that aims to transform the way city services are delivered, using principles of entrepreneurial innovation and collaboration formulated with the help of HBS faculty.
Over its five-year history, the office has partnered with other universities around the Boston area, though it has always maintained a particularly close relationship with Harvard, partnering with the University and leveraging its vast academic resources.
From research and teaching partnerships to smartphone apps and projects analyzing how to improve city services, city officials and Harvard faculty say, the New Urban Mechanics are redefining what civic innovation means in the 21st century.
“People see New Urban Mechanics and working for the city of Boston in general as one way they can change the world,” the office's co-chair Christopher P. Osgood said.
FROM HBS TO CITY HALL
Former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who was himself nicknamed the “Urban Mechanic,” created the Office of New Urban Mechanics in 2010 with an eye toward embracing technology to find ways of improving city services for the 21st century.
The Office now works to build “partnerships between internal agencies and outside entrepreneurs to pilot projects that address resident needs,” according to its website. It has focused its work on areas such as education, city infrastructure, and improved constituent services.
New Urban Mechanics has been tied to Harvard since its conception. Though the Office was not founded until 2010, the phrase “New Urban Mechanics” was first coined in 2005 by Mitchell B. Weiss ’99, a Harvard Business School lecturer, who was then a student at HBS, working as a fellow in the Mayor’s Office.
Weiss later oversaw the launch of the office while he was serving as chief of staff for Menino.
Now a senior lecturer at HBS, he credits many faculty members with providing mentoring and insights on everything from the organization of the office, to open innovation and open government.
“HBS made it possible for us to be there in the Mayor’s Office in the first place...but HBS also trained us to do something there to make a difference in the world,” Weiss said. “The way we decided to make a difference was to invent.”
Osgood, a fellow Business School alum, agreed that the school taught him to apply business strategies to public sector work, while connecting him to a network of colleagues who graduated from the Business School and still work in Boston City Hall.
“HBS does a very good job of helping students understand how organizations should be best structured to deliver value for their customers or constituents,” Osgood said. “It’s something that which we think a lot about in our work which is really understanding what customer needs are or constituent needs are.”
‘URBAN MECHANICS’
Since 2010, the program has worked to launch several initiatives aimed at streamlining traditional city services.
One of its innovations is a iPhone app called “Street Bump,” which uses data from car trips to identify potholes. “Adopt-A-Hydrant” is another. The mobile application allows citizens to adopt a fire hydrant to shovel out after snowfall. The office has also launched “Discover BPS,” a web app modeled on the platform for travel websites like KAYAK or Orbitz. It helps parents better compare public school options available for their children.
The projects share in the broader philosophy embraced by the office: that ideas of entrepreneurship and innovation can be applied to tangibly improve city services.
“New Urban Mechanics is about the power of innovative partnerships inside government and outside government,” said Weiss.
‘A NOVEL PARTNERSHIP’
As New Urban Mechanics designs and launches new technologies to streamline city services, Harvard has continued to offer guidance and support to its staff.
Susan Crawford, currently a visiting professor at the Law School, has collaborated with the Office of New Urban Mechanics on a number of projects. In 2012, as a visiting professor at the Kennedy School, she taught a course at Harvard’s Innovation Lab called “Solving Problems Using Technology.” Students worked alongside staff from New Urban Mechanics to brainstorm ways to promote cultural activities around Dudley in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, and to encourage local children to become involved in the neighborhood association.
“It was an extremely creative course and very constructive both for the students and the neighborhood,” Crawford said. “It changed the lives of several students who’ve gone on to have jobs [in this field].”
Crawford hasn’t stopped there. As a visiting professor at the Law School, she collaborated with the program on projects that connect Harvard Law students with the City of Boston to examine policy issues like the potential for video surveillance by drones.
“These are big pieces of policy...what the students do becomes part of the resources that the city is drawing on,” Crawford said. “What all of us are trying to do is build the pipeline of people who see serving in government as part of their careers.”
Other Harvard affiliates have contributed academic literature to the project. Daniel T. O’Brien—the research director of the Boston Area Research Initiative at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, whose mission is to “foster original urban research in age of digital data”—has collaborated with the New Urban Mechanics to produce several papers, including one on how residents use Boston’s City Service Hotline.
Business School professor Michael I. Norton has also partnered with New Urban Mechanics when conducting research. He has worked with the office to find a better way to display city services, including a streamlined new website that lets constituents see how the city spends its money. He is also working on a tool that would track how and where tax dollars are spent, along the lines of Domino’s online pizza tracker. The interface, Norton said, should help improve transparency and educate citizens about city budgets.
The Office’s emphasis on public-private collaboration and innovation, some say, has made academics more willing to partner with the office.
“Government agencies aren’t always known for flexibility or open-mindedness,” Norton said, noting that he has found New Urban Mechanics to be the opposite.
Harvard has long funneled Business School fellows to public service positions around Boston, and as the New Urban Mechanics expands its presence, it has received a steady flow of students and alums both from the fellowship program at the Business School and the Rappaport and Radcliffe Institutes.
Some Harvard affiliates noted that the focus on public service, which leverages innovative new solutions to address civic problems, reflects a broader goal embraced by the Harvard community.
Neal Doyle, an assistant director at Harvard’s Innovation Lab,  which has partnered with the Office, calls it “direction from the top.”
“This is a neat opportunity to really see Harvard take its great resources and training and study and turn it into practice,” he said.
Weiss said he expects the relationship between the University and the program to continue developing.
“It’s been a very innovative and novel partnership,” Weiss said. “It will continue to iterate and improve as we would expect from a good entrepreneurial endeavor.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Architect Renzo Piano outlined the trials and triumphs of designing the new Harvard Art Museums building, speaking to a packed Piper Auditorium Thursday evening.
Piano, who also designed The Shard in London and the The New York Times Building in Manhattan, discussed his work on the Harvard Art Museums with museum director Thomas W. Lentz and Columbia University architecture professor Kenneth Frampton in a conversation immediately after his lecture.
The event, titled “How Did You Do It, Mr. Piano?”, coincided with the student opening of the Art Museums, which have been under renovation since 2008 and are opening to the public on Nov. 16.
Piano drew particular attention to the new interior courtyard of the Fogg museum, noting that the original design drew inspiration from the Italian town of Montepulciano. Piano also likened the revamped, new courtyard to an Italian piazza.
“The piazza...is kind of the center point of the entire composition, it is a meeting point,” Piano said. The revamped Art Museums’ courtyard will be freely accessible to the general public.
Piano also emphasized the importance of natural light in the building’s composition. The conservation labs, where artwork is restored and preserved, are located at the top of the building and can tune natural light to their needs.  An additional art study space will be located under the building’s the building’s glass roof, which Piano likened to a “lantern.” The exterior of the building is made of Alaskan yellow cedar wood.
During the conversation, Lentz discussed some of the difficulties the University had in working on the project, which he said took 17 years to conceive, design, and construct—partially due to hurdles in negotiating the design with both the Cambridge and Massachusetts Historical Commissions. Lentz also pointed out the poor condition of the “much-beloved” original Fogg building, which he called “a wreck, an absolute wreck.”
After the event, Phillip L. Harrison ’86, co-chair of the Graduate School of Design’s capital campaign, said he thought the talk was “fantastic” and that he found Piano “extremely down to earth, charming, funny” and “quite capable at describing the complexity of design.”
Harrison added that he thought the new Art Museums would have an impact on GSD’s capital campaign.
“I think as one of the most important new buildings on the Harvard campus, the new Museum, designed by one of the most important architects in the world, will just highlight the critical importance design can bring to an organization like Harvard,” Harrison said.
Piano said in his lecture that he hoped that the Harvard Art Museums would make Cambridge a better place to live, and expressed his conviction “that beauty will save the world”
“Fundamentally, this new institution is about beauty. It is about culture... and the strength of knowledge and [beauty] joined, and this is what makes people better people...this is what humanity needs,” Piano said.

UPDATED: November 16, 2014, at 11:50 a.m.
A self-inflicted global crisis is a far greater hazard to human existence than any natural catastrophe, according to Martin J. Rees, a professor at the University of Cambridge who gave a lecture Thursday afternoon at the Kennedy School of Government.
Rees, alongside a panel organized by the Program for Science, Technology, and Society, discussed the variety of possible causes of an “existential crisis” for humanity, through the lenses of various disciplines.
Rees discussed the sources of possible catastrophes, ranging from climate change to artificial intelligence.
“We just don’t know the boundary of what may happen and what will remain science fiction,” Rees said. He went on to stress that “existential crises deserve more attention even though they are unlikely.”
Additionally, he said that the probability of a wide-scale disaster is not as small as many believe, quoting the maxim, “the unfamiliar is not the same as the impossible.”
The discussion then turned to what may be done to address these catastrophic possibilities. Rees spoke to how political actors have a limited scope for action in such cases, citing climate change as an example.
“All these issues are widely discussed; what’s depressing is the inaction. For politicians, the immediate trumps the long term, the parochial trumps the global,” Rees said.
Jennifer Hochschild, Harvard College professor of Government and a member of the panel, described how partisan politics plays a role in the response to these potential disasters. Although once not a source of political contention, scientific and technological advances, Hochschild argued, have become a partisan matter.
Hochschild said that the political dimension of catastrophes is not as clear cut as liberal and conservative. She said that a democratic system encourages politicians to focus on garnering the support of constituents, and so “the right policy is the one that gets 50 percent plus one of the vote,” regardless of political affiliation.
Linn W. Hobbs, a member of the audience and a professor of Material Science and Nuclear Engineering at MIT, pointed out that human ingenuity is crucial to our survival as a species, an element of human culture that other panelists had not touched on. While the panel was thorough with the different disciplines represented, Hobbs said that he wished an anthropological perspective was present at the talk.
Rees stressed that people should not only consider the present needs of humanity but also the welfare of future generations.
“[We] should care as much about those in the 22nd century and beyond as those that are alive now,” Rees said.

More than five-hundred undergraduate and graduate students draped in festive attire filled the Calderwood Courtyard to mark the student opening of the Harvard Art Museums Thursday.
The lucky recipients of the tickets, which sold out within a few hours, were greeted by numerous members of the administration including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, amid exclamations of wonder at the sight of the renovated space.
The director of the Harvard Art Museums, Thomas W. Lentz, discussed the novelty of the new building. “This is a brand new museum,” he said. “We have taken everything apart about the old museum and put it back together again.”
Designed by renowned architect Renzo Piano, the new features of the 240,000 square-foot building include an expansion of gallery space to 43,000 square feet, six levels of all-purpose “public space,” a glass roof, a 300-person lecture hall, rooms for teaching, exhibition, and research, and a cafe.
The Harvard Art Museums will open to the public on Nov. 16 after six years and $250 million worth of renovations. Throughout the six years, construction workers have worked more than one million labor hours and the muesums’ collections have been moved twice. The renovation combined the Fogg Museum, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum into a single complex, with the staff of all three museums working together for the first time to fill the 50 galleries.
Students who had attended the University in 2008, when the Fogg first closed for remodeling, marvelled at its transformation. “Having been an undergrad when the museum first shut its doors for renovation, I can attest to the incredible transformation of this museum and this courtyard,” said Victoria D. Sung ’10, a member of the student board of the Harvard Art Museums.
The museum will keep its property in Somerville, where the entire collection was stored prior to the reopening, as a storage space.  The remodeled museum’s basement storage space does not have the capacity to store all 250,000 pieces in the museum’s collection.
Addressing attendees, Dean of the College, Rakesh Khurana said that the museum fulfilled the goals of the College. “Welcome to this transformative museum,” he said. “We hope it will play a critical reflective role in the lives of our students. As Tom [Lentz] said, this is yours.”
Students in attendance expressed their excitement regarding the space, as well as the prospect of access to a huge collection of art within such a close proximity.
“My impression is that a lot of harvard students are here to come check it out and celebrate it,” said Gabriel L. Guimaraes ’17. “ The paintings are all amazing and I wasn’t aware that Harvard had such an awesome collection.”
Others expressed concern regarding the juxtaposition of different styles of architecture in the combination of three museums but said they were were pleasantly surprised.
“I was a little skeptical and a little afraid but I am floored by how this building has taken the old and merged it with the new,” said Liesl Ulrich-Verderber ’15. “ It’s absolutely glorious.”

The Business School raised at least $721 million by the end of June in its ongoing capital campaign, reaching 72 percent of its $1 billion goal two months into the public phase of the fundraising effort, campaign leaders said.
The updated figure, which reflects the progress of the Business School’s campaign through June 30, comprises both the $600 million in gifts and pledges raised during its three-year quiet phase as well as those amassed in its public phase, which was launched at the end of April and will last until at least 2018. The Business School has not provided figures detailing the progress of the campaign since July 1.
The priorities of the campaign include innovation within its business education and managerial programs, broadening the international scope of research and curricula, financial aid, and fostering collaboration with other schools within the University, among others.
Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said in an interview Wednesday that the datum was even higher than that which he had imagined at the campaign’s start.
“I had thought that we would have been at some number that was north of 600 or 650 by the end of this year,” he said. “The fact that we are north of 700 is, in my mind, a great showing of strength in terms of the confidence that our alumni have in the school and the confidence that they have in some of the things that we are doing and the innovations that we are trying to advance with these resources.”
According to Janet Cahill, managing director of the Business School’s capital campaign and external relations, the fundraising effort has done well on a variety of metrics, including geographic and age distribution, as well as in terms of contribution size.
The external relations staff at the Business School has employed a regional strategy in fundraising and messaging for the campaign, according to Cahill, targeting alumni based on their geographic location, profession, and business  interests. By the campaign’s completion, the school expects to have hosted 27 domestic and international alumni events in order to reach its more than 71,600 alumni in 167 countries.
"Just looking at where we are to today versus in the last campaign, we are a much more global institution with our alumni all over the world,” said Cahill, referencing the school’s last fundraising drive, which raised $600 million before its closure in 2005. “So, as we looked at the 27 events we are doing, we knew that for a good portion of those we would need to go to alumni internationally."
Cahill also said that the school’s campaign website, the infrastructure for which required a substantial investment in the years leading up to the launch of the public phase, has received over 267,000 unique visitors since last September. That represents an increase in traffic of 73 percent, compared to the prior year’s fundraising site.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Corporation has yet to discuss a unanimous vote made Tuesday by members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences requesting that it reverse changes to the health plans Harvard offers to non-union employees, according to Corporation member James T. Rothenberg ’68.
Rothenberg said that he was not sure when he and the other fellows would discuss the Faculty’s request.
"I cannot make any comment until the Corporation has a chance to discuss the request," he wrote in an email Wednesday.
Other members of the Corporation did not respond to requests for comment, were unavailable, or declined to comment. Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 and Karen Gordon Mills deferred response to Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, where University spokesperson Jeff Neal said Thursday that there were no updates to be reported from University President Drew G. Faust or the Corporation.
After Tuesday’s meeting, Faust told a reporter that she would be “replying in due course” to the Faculty vote. The vote—a rare maneuver by the Faculty—carries only symbolic weight.
Meanwhile, the open enrollment period for the health plans in question rolled out Wednesday at 8 a.m. as scheduled.
Dean of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, who had yet to comment on the vote publicly, wrote a statement to The Crimson on the matter Thursday but did not speak of any further action.
“I fully supported the Faculty Council Docket Committee in providing the FAS Faculty with an opportunity to share their thoughts and concerns on the benefits changes with the president, provost, and leaders of the University Benefits Committee. Discussion and debate are hallmarks of the Harvard community–it is important that they always be open, honest, and respectful,” Smith wrote.
The motion that prompted Tuesday’s vote was initiated by History professor Mary D. Lewis, who confirmed in an email Thursday that the Corporation has not contacted her regarding the motion. It asked “that the President and Fellows replace the new benefits plan with an appropriately adjusted version of the 2014 health benefit package, maintaining the 2014 plan design.”
Faculty members have primarily criticized the new plan, which was announced early September, for its  introduction of  copays and deductibles for non-routine health appointments. Employees will be liable to pay up to $1,500 a person and up to $4,500 a year for families of three or more out of pocket to cover copays, coinsurance, deductibles, and drug costs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 9, 2014, at 2:00 p.m.
Buoyed by about $420 million in current use gifts, Harvard posted a $2.7 million operating surplus in Fiscal Year 2014, marking a period of financial progress that stands in contrast to deficits of recent years.
“Just as last year’s $34 million deficit was not cause for undue alarm, so is this year’s surplus not cause for excessive optimism,” wrote Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp and University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 in a letter released Friday with Harvard’s FY14 financial report.
Harvard’s small surplus is a move into the black after recent years of deficits large and small. The progress was largely fueled by the first public year of fundraising for the Harvard Campaign. In the fiscal year spanning July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, the fundraising drive brought in nearly $1.2 billion in total gifts, including $419 million of current use giving. The University’s endowment now stands at $36.4 billion, up from $32.7 billion in FY13. The fund, which is the largest in higher education, nevertheless remains slightly below its pre-crisis peak of $36.9 billion.
“The close of our fiscal year marked the anniversary of the public launch of the Harvard Campaign, which has energized and engaged Harvard alumni around the world,” wrote University President Drew G. Faust in a letter accompanying the report. Faust recognized two donors in particular: Kenneth E. Griffin ’89, who pledged $150 million in early 2014, and the foundation run by Gerald L. Chan, which pledged $350 million to rename the School of Public Health in September.
But the report struck a balance somewhere between enthusiastic recognition of the Harvard Campaign’s progress and a more somber emphasis on Harvard’s ongoing cost control measures. Those efforts have become a campus-wide issue this term after the University made significant changes to non-union employee health benefit plans in September. Earlier this week, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted unanimously to ask the Harvard Corporation to reverse the changes, but open enrollment began Wednesday with no such action.
“With approximately half of Harvard’s budget allocated to compensation, we have been focusing our efforts in recent years on initiatives to control staff growth, to opportunistically seek efficiencies in our business practices, and to evaluate the University’s benefits offerings relative to both peers and the local market,” Lapp and Finnegan wrote.
In FY14, Harvard’s costs for active employee benefit plans rose 5 percent to about $160 million. Benefit costs, particularly relating to health insurance, have risen steadily in recent years and are projected by experts to continue climbing.
Overall cost control measures, including those affecting benefits, were justified by a number of factors, according to Lapp and Finnegan. FY14 marked another year of decline in the research support Harvard receives from the federal government, with the University's total federally sponsored research funding falling by 5 percent from $653 million to $611 million in part due to federal sequestration. Federal money accounts for 75 percent of total sponsored revenue, which was $819 million in FY14, down 2 percent from $832 million in FY13.
Increased expenditures in certain priority areas also justified cost control initiatives, Lapp and Finnegan wrote. As federal support declined, Harvard continued to spend more on cornerstone programs like financial aid. The University spent $503 million on student financial aid grants and awards in FY14, up from $487 million in FY13. Gifts like Griffin’s, as well as a 6 percent bump in student revenue, helped fund the increase in aid, according to the report. The overall capital expenditure also included some small projects in Allston, but not the large School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex that is planned for the Boston neighborhood.
Harvard also invested significantly in its infrastructure last year. Total capital expenditures of $465 million, up from $404 million in FY13, fueled an ongoing wave of campus building projects, from the Business School’s Tata Hall to the College’s undergraduate Houses to the renovation and expansion of the Harvard Art Museums, many of which were funded in part by philanthropy but which still incurred significant University cost.
Despite the mixed financial picture, Harvard continued to make money off its brand, logging $89 million in income from publications and $44 million in sales income.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though they are now focused on the political arena, Massachusetts’s Governor-elect Charlie Baker ’79 and Attorney General-elect Maura Healey ’92 have past experience in a different type of arena—the basketball arena. Both newly elected officials were former members of the Harvard basketball program during their time in Cambridge.
Massachusetts’s voters are optimistic that Baker will have more success in his role as Governor than he did as a basketball player for the Crimson. Baker was a member of the junior varsity teams his freshman and sophomore seasons at Harvard, before finally making it to the varsity squad during his junior year. Over the course of eight games, Baker scored 13 points and had eight rebounds and an assist during a low period for the Crimson men’s team.
Before his senior season, the Ivy League implemented an overdue rule change that allowed freshmen to play on the varsity team.  With the addition of these new players, Baker was no longer an asset to the team. Instead of flat-out cutting him from the squad, Harvard coach Frank McLaughlin recommended Baker for an assistant coaching position on the junior varsity team. Baker took the position and ended his formal playing career.
Healey, on the other hand, excelled as a member of the women’s team. The 5’4’’ guard was a co-captain her senior year, and took charge of the court despite being one of the shortest players on the team. Under the charge of current head coach Kathy Delany Smith, Healey helped lead the Crimson to an Ivy League Championship in 1991.
In Healey’s senior season, Harvard had a rough start but won nine of its last 10 games to post a 14-12 record. Healey finished the year averaging 5.7 assists per game, then the second-best single-season rate in Crimson history.
Following graduation, Healey pursued a professional basketball career in Austria for UBBC Wustenrot Salzburg. After overcoming rule changes and language barriers, Healey claimed a spot on the starting rotation at point guard for two seasons, before returning to Massachusetts to attend law school at Northeastern University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Very rarely does a team have the chance to make a big statement in the early games of its season. This weekend, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team has one of these uncommon opportunities—to take down the defending national champions on their own ice.
The Crimson (0-0-1, 0-0-1 ECAC) will face off against Rensselaer (3-5-0, 2-0-0) and reigning national champions Union (5-3-0, 0-2-0) in Upstate New York this weekend with a chance to send an emphatic message to the rest of the ECAC.
Emerging victorious in Schenectady will be no easy task for Harvard. Last season, the Crimson scored first in each of its two matchups with the Dutchmen but skated away with a pair of narrow regulation losses.
“Hopefully we play well Friday and we can take it into Saturday against Union,” junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “They’re the reigning champions, so everyone’s going to be targeting them before games.”
After a 22-game unbeaten streak that included their title run, the Dutchmen have lost their last three games--the last two against RPI in a home-at-home series last weekend. The Engineers dominated Union at home on Friday, 6-1, before edging their in-state rivals on the road the next night in overtime, 2-1.
The Union offense, which was held to one goal in each of its last two games, will look to rebound with the help of senior Daniel Ciampini and sophomore Mike Vecchione. Ciampini finished second in the ECAC last year in goals scored and has eight points in eight games thus far in the year while Saugus, Mass. native Vecchione leads the team with 12 points.
In net, Dutchman senior Colin Stevens will also try to reassert himself after uncharacteristically ceding four goals in less than two periods of play last Friday. He was outdueled in both games by junior RPI goaltender Jason Kasdorf, who has shown fine form through six games after missing most of last season to injury.
In addition to Kasdorf, other players have taken on increased responsibility for the Engineers this year. Sophomore forward Riley Bourbonnais scored his first collegiate hat trick on Friday. RPI will have to continue to find new sources of offense with the departure of leading scorer Ryan Haggerty to the professional ranks.
RPI was one of only two ECAC teams that failed to beat Harvard last season. The Crimson picked up three points on the Engineers in a 3-3 tie on the road and a 2-0 home win.
This weekend, Harvard will attempt to add to its conference point total after opening the year with a 3-3 tie against Dartmouth. In order to do so, the Crimson’s top line of Criscuolo, junior Jimmy Vesey, and freshman Alex Kerfoot will have to continue to click.
“Our forwards played really well,” junior defenseman Patrick McNally said. “Our first line dominated when they were out there.”
Kerfoot scored the team’s first goal of the season with a pair of assists from his linemates last Saturday. Vesey, who led the team with 13 goals last season, had seven shots on goal and will try to break out of an eight-game scoreless streak this weekend.
On the blue, McNally also loomed large for Harvard last Saturday with a pair of goals, doubling his season total from last year. In 2013-2014, the Crimson defense trailed all ECAC teams in scoring with only four goals but debuted a more aggressive attack in its season opener.
Overall, the Crimson struggled in its opening shifts, failing to register a shot in the first 10 minutes, but gained strength as the game progressed, ultimately outshooting the Big Green, 37-32. This Saturday, Harvard will need to put together last season’s quick starts with last weekend’s strong finish to have a shot against the champs.
“I think we had a lot of good energy,” Criscuolo said of the Crimson’s opening tie. “But we can definitely get some more shots to the net early in the game and work on our start.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everybody loves a good story. I hear you, Folklore and Mythology concentrators—we all know you feel especially strong on this point. But the rest of us can testify to the value of a captivating narrative just as well.
Now think, what elements constitute a quality story? To begin, a good plot must start with killer characters and daunting obstacles. It definitely needs a little bit of drama. And the presence of a compelling adversary doesn’t hurt.
Let’s consider the Harvard football team through this lens. Interesting characters? Look no further than an offense that shuffles players into the spotlight with record-breaking performances on what seems to be a weekly basis. Significant obstacles? Check. Take the last two weeks, when the Crimson hit the road and demolished rival Princeton, 49-7, and then earned a double-digit victory at Dartmouth without missing a beat. Both teams were tied with Harvard for first place entering the games.
Don’t get me wrong, the Crimson has been fun to watch this year. But when it comes down to it, undefeated Harvard has been so good that it can’t fulfill the final two requirements of a good story. And the team only has its own dominance to blame.
Drama? Unless you count overcoming a second-half deficit against Brown, there hasn’t been all that much of it. The Crimson has won each of its four conference games this season by an average of 19.5 points. How about a compelling adversary? That was supposed to be Princeton, but the evil villain was a no-show as Harvard racked up a school-record 698 yards. The battle that was billed as Rocky vs. Drago was more reminiscent of Globo Gym toying with each of its opponents on the way to the finals of the American Dodgeball Association of America.
While Harvard has not fulfilled all of our classic story components, it’s fair to say that this season has been a tale of Crimson supremacy. In all likelihood, the plot will not encounter any kind of twist this weekend when tail-spinning Columbia comes to town. Not only are the Lions winless this year, but they also have not won a football game since…wait for it…the fall of 2012.
One might compare this weekend’s 7-0 vs. 0-7 matchup to the duel between David and Goliath. The only trouble with this analogy is that David ended up winning. Let’s just say I don’t see that happening on Saturday. A reasonable expectation would be what happens when a droid or stormtrooper takes on somebody with a lightsaber in Star Wars. The Jedi knows he’s going to win, and win he always does.
Let’s apply our story theme once more—this time to the remainder of the Crimson’s season. After taking on the tame Lions, Harvard travels to Pennsylvania to face the 1-6 Quakers. Both games should represent easy wins. But after that it gets considerably tougher—and more interesting—when Yale comes to town. Harvard has won The Game the last seven times, but the Bulldogs boast the conference’s top offense and represent a legitimate threat to the Crimson’s undefeated season.
For my part, I’ll be thinking of these next three games as the complete and utter opposite of The Godfather series. In the classic trilogy, part one was great, part two was perhaps even better, and part three was pretty much skippable. For the Harvard football team, while the next two games will be forgettable, the third is the one everybody wants to see.
Alas, you can’t get to number three without first experiencing one and two. The conclusion to the long journey begins this week. Will the story have a happy ending?
PENN AT PRINCETON
Watch out! Take cover! It’s the battle of the killer bees! What’s that? Oh, they’re not bees, they’re P’s. Let’s be real, though, this contest between the Killer P’s will be a lot less fierce than one among killer bees. After getting smacked by Harvard two weeks ago, the Tigers (4-3, 3-1 Ivy) surrendered 27 points in a closer-than-it-should-have-been victory over winless Cornell.  And Penn (1-6, 1-3) has just one Ivy League win over (guess who?) Columbia.
Prediction: Princeton 31, Penn 17
YALE AT BROWN
If a Yale (6-1, 3-1) bulldog took on a Brown (4-3, 2-2) bear in a fight, I definitely feel like I’d have to go with the bear. But what if it’s one of those little sun bears and a really fierce bulldog? That might be more interesting. It could probably go on for a while if the bear doesn’t get too tired and fall asleep. I’m getting sidetracked. The Ancient Eight’s top-ranked offense—led by quarterback Morgan Roberts, running back Tyler Varga, and wide receiver Deon Randall—will propel Yale to victory.
Prediction: Yale 27, Brown 13
DARTMOUTH AT CORNELL
The Big Green (5-2, 3-1) face off with the Big Red (0-7, 0-4) this Saturday afternoon, but there’s nothing big about this game. Dartmouth needs the win to keep its Ivy League title hopes alive, and Cornell won’t represent much of an obstacle. Hanover to Ithaca though…what a depressing drive all around.
Prediction: Dartmouth 31, Cornell 10
COLUMBIA AT HARVARD
C’mon, do I really need to keep talking about this game? Harvard (7-0, 4-0) will say that it won’t be looking past Columbia (0-7, 0-4) this weekend, but it should. Because let’s be honest, the Lions will be looking past the Crimson. After all, next Saturday, the winless Lions take on the 0-7 Big Red in what may be the biggest game of the year for both squads. It may be hard to believe, but one of the two teams will leave the field with a victory.
Prediction: Harvard 45, Columbia 7

Happy Friday everyone! The week is finally over, but it’s not just any weekend—it’s Freshman Parents Weekend (cue the impending shrieks from parents upon seeing that their children’s under-bed storage has become a living dust sculpture exhibition)! Here are some lies freshmen will probably tell their parents this weekend:
“Yep, don’t worry! I eat balanced meals every day!”Truth: If by balanced you mean skipping dinner because it’s mysterious meat in an even more mysterious sauce and then consuming 50 million grams of sugar on the cereal at Brain Break (s/o to Cinnamon Toasters, Apple Zings, and Honey Graham Squares– keep on rocking), then yes.
“I love the MAC! I have free access to a great quality gym so I can stay fit and healthy!”Truth: Sorry, Mom. Those $100 Lululemon yoga pants I just ordered online using your credit card are never actually going to hit the gym. They’re more for show, like for when I want to appear sporty chic and make people think I work out.
“Yeah, it’d be great if you could put more money into my savings account because I spent all my money on textbooks.”Truth: Why buy textbooks when you can find questionable PDF versions of them online and spend that money instead on Chipotle?
IN THE ATMOSPHERETomorrow will be 50 degrees with a 10 percent chance of rain, so you have a slightly better chance of staying dry, but about the same chance of being warm. 50/50 isn’t so bad, right?
