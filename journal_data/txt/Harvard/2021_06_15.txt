After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Blue Bottle Coffee turned its temporary Covid-wrought closure into a permanent one last month, leaving Harvard Square just three years after its opening.
The 40 Bow St. location of the multinational chain of coffee shops first shuttered at the start of the pandemic and — besides a short reopening ending in late April — remained out of business until officially closing its doors on May 30. Blue Bottle has yet to publicly announce the closing, and a “temporarily closed” poster remains on the front door, but several employees at other Boston-area locations as well as an internal company email obtained by The Crimson confirmed that the closure is permanent.
Denise A. Jillson, director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she believed the store, located between the River Houses and Harvard Yard, first temporarily closed due to a lack of student foot traffic after undergraduates left campus.
But Blue Bottle Coffee identified its Harvard Square location as one of several that has “chronically represented challenges for us fiscally, even before Covid-19,” according to the internal email.
When Charles X. Hua ’22-’23 visited the Harvard Square cafe on April 24, he said he learned that it was the last day of the store’s brief mid-pandemic reopening before its uncertain closure. Hua added that the baristas seemed unsure if the store would ever reopen.
Seven Blue Bottle Coffee stores across the country were temporarily closed for several months due to the coronavirus, per the internal email. Those locations and five others permanently shuttered on May 30.
The email to employees also noted the permanent closure of another Boston-area Blue Bottle Coffee located in the Exchange Conference Center in Boston’s Seaport District.
Blue Bottle Coffee’s Kendall Square, Newbury Street, Chestnut Hill, and Prudential Center stores remain open. Harvard Square staff were transferred to other nearby locations, according to the email.
Blue Bottle Coffee’s corporate office as well as representatives of Morningside Group, which Jillson said is involved in managing the 40 Bow St. property, did not respond to requests for comment.
Seth D. Billiau ’21 said he was saddened by Blue Bottle’s closing, having occasionally stopped by the Harvard Square cafe to share coffee with his girlfriend.
“I would go every once in a while if I wanted to treat myself a little bit,” he said, adding that there will be a “void” in Harvard Square for higher-end coffee.
Amy Huang ’24 shared in an email that she loves to work in cafes and has fond memories of frequenting Blue Bottle Coffee with her roommates the summer after it opened.
“The Square will simply lose another place to get coffee in the morning, but Blue Bottle means a little bit more than that to me,” she wrote.
The building at 40 Bow St. was previously redeveloped by real estate billionaire Gerald L. Chan, a major donor to the School of Public Health, beginning in 2014. Blue Bottle Coffee announced its move to the spot in late 2016. Following delays, it finally opened to crowds in February 2018.
At the time, some students praised Blue Bottle Coffee’s single-origin coffee and minimalist, “bougie” aesthetic, while others called it an overpriced competitor to nearby Flour and Tatte.
Blue Bottle Coffee’s departure follows a string of pandemic-driven closures that will leave the Square’s post-Covid business landscape far different when undergraduates return en masse in the fall.
Jillson said that if the 40 Bow St. space opens up for a new business, “it’ll be another opportunity to have some vibrancy in that corner, which tends to be a little quiet.”
“I would hope that it would be another really nice coffee shop for students,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Harvard Global Health Institute launched a task force last month with the mission of preventing future pandemics.
Led by Aaron Bernstein — interim director of Harvard Chan C-CHANGE and a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School — the Scientific Task Force to Prevent Pandemics at the Source hopes to shift the focus of pandemic-related discussion from management and treatment to prevention, especially at the critical point where diseases transfer from animals to people.
“The reality is that right now, pretty much all the discussions about preventing the next pandemic are limited to after people get sick,” Bernstein said in an interview. “But there is an enormous hole in this approach, which is the reality that these emerging infections overwhelmingly come from a spillover of pathogens from wildlife to people sometimes through livestock.”
“If we fail to address that, then we can spend all the money we want on things that help us after people get sick — but they may not help much,” he added.
Spanning several continents, the task force consists of researchers in varying realms of scientific expertise, including environment, biomedicine, public health, and epidemiology.
Deborah T. Kochevar, a member of the task force and a former dean at the Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, noted the importance of having a diverse makeup of scientists on the task force.
“Because we come from different backgrounds and bring different perspectives, then I think we’ll be able to have insights that will be particularly helpful in terms of focusing on prevention of pandemics,” she said.
Recent research showed that investing in spillover prevention in the short term can save a significant amount of money in the future, according to Bernstein.
“We could spend somewhere around $20 to $30 billion a year to focus efforts in the places we have seen diseases emerge most often,” he said. “If we spent that amount every year for a decade, we would only have spent around one percent, maybe two, of the total cost of Covid-19.”
Task force member Guilherme L. Werneck, a professor of epidemiology at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said the task force aims to use preventative planning to address the extended effects of pandemic on other issues such as environmental concerns, population movement, and poverty.
“For instance, if you prevent deforestation, you also affect climate change, so you’re not only preventing the next pandemic, but you’re also helping to improve our environment and our health in general,” Werneck said.
Bernstein said the task force aims to have a report evaluating the science around spillover and recommending actions to prevent spillover by the end of the summer. Once the report is complete, the task force will be working with government leaders as well as leaders from private and nonprofit sectors to ensure the report’s findings and recommendations are put to good use, he added.
The task force’s research will be translated into policy recommendations to inform global leaders’ discussions at two international conferences: the G20 Summit in October and the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties in November.
“These types of diseases, they don’t respect the borders of countries,” Werneck said. “Without multilateral collaboration, they are not going anywhere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Harvard Medical School George Q. Daley ’82 said he has “never been more proud” of the role Medical School faculty, staff, and students played in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic in an interview with The Crimson last month.
According to Daley, HMS researchers had a major role in the scientific and clinical development of two major vaccine platforms, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, as well as in understanding the “structural biology” of the virus itself.
Daley said some research at the Medical School is now focusing on drug development with hopes of eventually identifying a “pan-coronavirus inhibitor.”
“Even though we now have vaccines, the longer term battle against this virus and other emerging pathogens will be to develop drugs that can be deployed more quickly and more readily,” he said.
Much of the progress made in Covid-19 research by HMS faculty has been facilitated by the creation of the Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness and has allowed for “more rapid sharing of information” regarding best practices, Daley said. MassCPR is anchored at Harvard Medical School, and now includes more than 500 clinicians and scientists at 17 institutions.
Daley said he appreciates the “remarkable dedication” of support staff, particularly those working in infectious disease labs, who have helped to keep labs “up and running” through the height of the pandemic.
“Those labs that were directly involved in Covid research remained open and, in fact, really, really amplified their focus on aspects of the virus — the immune response and the host response,” Daley said.
According to Daley, the Medical School as a whole has also been “more open” than the rest of Harvard, as medical students shifted to a hybrid learning program starting in January.
Daley said the pivot to virtual pedagogy has demanded “a tremendous amount of innovation” from HMS faculty in maintaining and enhancing the quality of education offered during the pandemic.
According to Daley, HMS staff have been utilizing “various machine interfaces” and augmented reality technologies to teach portions of the Medical School curriculum, such as human anatomy and physiology. While Daley said he believes these learning interfaces cannot substitute physical learning experiences, like dissections, he noted that these technologies “complement” traditional teaching approaches in medicine.
“My hope is that the lessons learned are going to persist beyond the pandemic and improve the range of approaches to teaching medical education,” Daley said.
Daley also highlighted HMS’s integration of student feedback into faculty instruction through a program in which medical students can meet regularly with teaching faculty to provide suggestions on improving curriculum delivery.
At the same time that the pandemic has caused enormous pain and suffering, Daley said it has also allowed for more visibility for the “deep compassion” of medical and nursing professions in particular, perhaps driving the surge in applications the school received this year.
“I hope and I believe that it has reminded the greater community of the importance of medicine, of the importance of access to medical care as a human right, not as a privilege,” he said. “I hope that part of that [increase in applications] is driven by the profound sense that medicine is an incredibly important and meaningful way to commit one’s talents to the service of others.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 16, 2021 at 11:03 a.m.
Harvard Government professor Danielle S. Allen will officially launch her 2022 campaign for Massachusetts governor as a Democratic candidate on Boston Common Tuesday morning.
The decision comes after Allen — who also directs Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics — announced that she was exploring a candidacy last December. At that time, Allen told The Crimson that while she has not previously held elected office, she would apply her experience in academia to her historic bid.
Allen joins former Massachusetts State Sen. Ben B. Downing as the second Democratic candidate to announce a gubernatorial campaign. Incumbent Republican Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, who enjoys strong support among Democrats, has not yet announced his 2022 plans.
Allen wrote in an email to The Crimson Monday that she was inspired to run for governor after observing how the pandemic exposed and exacerbated existing inequities for Massachusetts residents.
“It’s not as if that separation in our society just started last winter. It’s been building for some time,” she wrote. “We have a lot of work to do to reimagine and pull together to build a foundation of social and civic infrastructure on which all can stand up and thrive. It shouldn’t be every person for themselves anymore.”
Allen also wrote that her meetings with Massachusetts residents since December confirmed her belief in her campaign’s ability to “knit communities back together” post-pandemic.
She added that her platform would focus on housing, transportation, schools, jobs, and justice to create a “fair, flourishing, and sustainable economy.”
Allen is the first Black woman to run for Massachusetts governor as part of a major party. And, if elected, she would be the first Black woman governor in the nation.
“I appreciate the weight and importance of this moment but there’s also some pain that in the state that was first to abolish enslavement, almost 250 years ago, it has taken this long to reach a place where leadership is open to all,” she wrote.
Allen joined Harvard’s faculty in 2015, quickly rising through the ranks. Just a year-and-a-half after her arrival, she was named a University professor — the highest honor available to faculty.
Allen noted that her time in administrative and faculty roles at Harvard have helped her focus on the “fundamental job” of team-building, a skill which she wrote would help her in her campaign and if elected.
She will take leave from Harvard beginning July 1 to focus on her campaign.
Allen wrote that her work in education has always been in service of her role as a “citizen in democracy.” She also cited her previous advocacy work outside of academia on behalf of adult education, justice reform, democracy reform, civic education, and now Covid-19 response.
“I’ve always worn two hats, and now it’s time for me to take one off and concentrate on the citizen hat,” she wrote.
