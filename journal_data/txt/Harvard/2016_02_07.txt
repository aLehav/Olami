After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two goals from junior forward Sydney Daniels sent the Harvard women’s hockey team (13-9-2, 9-6-2 ECAC) to a 3-3 stalemate against ECAC bottom feeder Brown (3-18-3, 1-13-3).
Just over four minutes into the final frame, Daniels fired the Crimson into the lead with a shot from just outside the crease after rookie Audrey Warner’s shot ricocheted to Daniels for the junior’s eleventh goal of the season.
A Harvard victory wasn’t meant to be, however, as Brown forward Erin Conway’s power play goal gave the Bears a share of the spoils. After a shot by sophomore Sam Donovan on the man-advantage, the puck bounced off the crossbar and was poked home by Conway for the final scoreline.
While both teams pressured and created scoring opportunities in the extra frame, neither side was able to find the mesh before the final buzzer sounded.
The draw was the Crimson’s first since a 0-0 contest versus then-No. 4/4 Clarkson. Despite having a large shot advantage with 54 shots on goal––a season high––compared to just 30 for Brown, Harvard failed to claim the win. Junior netminder Brianna Laing made 27 saves on the night.
“We had a really good effort tonight.” Daniels said. “We didn’t get the bounces we wanted and that’s always difficult in a big Ivy League game.”
Four days after being held to just 12 shots against top-ranked Boston College in the Beanpot semifinals, the Crimson looked to take advantage of a porous Brown defense allowing an average of 3.71 goals per game––worst in the ECAC––to get back on track.
Harvard coach Katey Stone made a couple of changes to the first-line, placing sophomore Karly Heffernan on the front line for classmate Lexie Laing while replacing co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer with Laing between the sticks.
“[Brianna] played well on Tuesday night so we wanted to play her tonight and she did well.” Stone said. “We’re trying to find a little bit more offense and we’ve got a lot of moving parts, we’ve had kids moving in and out of the lineup so we’re going to keep working on this until we figure it out.”
After a scoreless first period that saw Harvard tally 18 shots on goal compared to a mere four from Brown, it was the Bears who found themselves on the scoreboard first early in the second stanza.
Following a faceoff in the Crimson defensive zone, Brown captain Kelly Micholson found the back of the net at the 3:13 mark, as her shot from just outside the crease made its way past Laing.
Harvard failed to take advantage of the opportunities handed to it in the following minutes, as Brown killed off a penalty despite being pressured by a determined Crimson offense. Harvard struggled to capitalize on the man advantage all night, failing to score on four penalty opportunities against the Bears.
The Crimson has failed to score on its last 25 power plays, with its last goal on the penalty occurring courtesy of freshman Grace Zarzecki against Cornell on Jan. 8.
“Our five need to work harder than their four,” Stone said. “We’ve got to possess the puck, we throw the puck around a lot and we don’t look sometimes…. Power plays are all about creating 2-on-1’s and right now it’s often very much a 1-on-1 situation.”
Despite failing to score during the man-advantage, Harvard evened up the score at the 9:13 mark thanks to sophomore Dani Krzyszczyk. After recovering possession in the neutral zone as Brown attempted to mount an attack, the forward exchanged a series of short passes with Zarzecki during a 2-on-1 before sending a backhand past Elvin.
Daniels put the Crimson up just over five minutes later with a rocket from the right faceoff circle. After a series of Harvard shots at goal, the puck ricocheted to the Southwick, Mass. native, who fired it home for the Crimson’s second tally of the night.
Though Daniel has been a star for the Crimson lately––with four goals in the team’s last two conference matchups––the junior insists a lot of the credit for her success falls to her teammates.
“I’m nothing without my team,” Daniels said. “I can’t do anything without them…. I’m lucky that it is me getting the goals but it could be anyone. Hopefully we get more of those coming up.”
The Bears, however, refused to back down. With just under two minutes left, rookie blueline Leah Olson fired a shot from the left faceoff circle that bounced off the pads of Laing. Classmate Cara Najjar was there to collect the puck and poke it into the mesh.
After Daniels recovered the lead for Harvard, the Brown offense sprung to life, particularly after a tripping penalty by sophomore Karly Heffernan during which co-captain Michelle Picard was forced into a diving save to prevent a Brown player from tucking in a loose rebound.
The Bears’ determination paid off, as Conway tallied her fourth goal of the season, destining the game to overtime.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN—Eleven straight times the Harvard men’s hockey team entered the belly of the Whale, and 11 straight times the Whale spit the Crimson right back out.
From December 2005 to February 2015, not once was Harvard able to beat Yale at the Whale—more commonly known as Ingalls Rink. But with its season on the line in the same building last March, the Crimson finally reversed its fate, taking two out of three playoff games in New Haven en route to a conference championship.
Playing at Ingalls for the first time since, Harvard had a chance to end another decade-long drought, as a win Saturday night would have secured the Crimson’s first Ivy League title in 10 years. But the defending champions are not ready to give up their crown just yet.
In front of a sold-out crowd of 3,500 on Alumni Weekend in New Haven, junior goaltender Alex Lyon made 19 saves in the game’s final frame, as the No. 11/11 Bulldogs hung on to beat No. 7/7 Harvard, 2-1.
With the win, Yale (14-5-4, 9-4-3 ECAC) pulls into a tie with the Crimson (13-6-3, 9-4-3) for second in the ECAC and ninth in the PairWise, keeping its own Ivy League championship hopes alive in the process. The Bulldogs took three points from the Crimson this year after a last-minute Joe Snively equalizer earned Yale a tie at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Nov. 6.
On Saturday, co-captain Jimmy Vesey nearly evened the score in the same fashion. With 18 seconds remaining in the contest, senior forward Colin Blackwell ripped a shot from atop the left faceoff circle that bounced out to co-captain Kyle Criscuolo just a few feet in front of Lyon.
On his forehand, Criscuolo fired a shot from point-blank range that grazed the chests of defenseman Ryan Obuchowski and Lyon before trickling to the goaltender’s left post, where Vesey stood in front of a half-empty net. But the golden opportunity came and went, as Vesey could hardly get his stick on the bouncing puck.
“Kyle shot the rebound, and I thought it was going to go over the net,” Vesey said. “I took one step toward the corner, realized the puck was where I just was, and at that point it was bouncing and in my feet a little. I took one swipe at it, missed, and then it was too late.”
The puck escaped to the backboards, and the Bulldogs made one final clear to seal the victory—one Yale had to come from behind to capture.
After Vesey opened the scoring with his 18th goal of the season 9:55 into the first period, junior forward John Hayden answered within two minutes after picking the pocket of senior defenseman Brayden Jaw.
Sneaking up on Jaw from behind, Hayden stole the puck and dumped it down to senior center Stu Wilson behind the goal line. There, Wilson threw the puck in the direction of the net, and it ricocheted off sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen’s right post in the direction of Hayden, who found the mesh to even the score at one apiece.
In the following period, the Bulldogs jumped in front on a virtual power play after Vesey lost his stick in a collision with senior forward Charles Orzetti. Yale held the attacking zone for nearly 90 seconds of ice time—48 seconds of which came after Vesey lost his stick—eventually leading to a Cody Learned blast at 9:52.
First, Orzetti tried a wrap-around attempt on Madsen’s right post—a shot the sophomore thought he had covered. But the puck rolled behind the net, and 20 seconds later, it found its way to Learned, who circled around rookie defenseman Viktor Dombrovskiy and into the slot, where he converted the game’s final tally.
Madsen made 20 saves on the night but struggled mightily with his rebound control. The shaky performance came one night after the sophomore allowed two goals from improbable angles near the goal line at Brown. After the game, however, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 deflected the blame.
“I think [goaltending issues] are in line with the rest of our team,” he said. “I think there were a lot of things—including from the net on out—that could have improvement.”
The two sides were locked in a physical battle right from the start, and tensions finally boiled over with a little over 13 minutes remaining. After Yale blue-liner Rob O’Gara pulled down junior forward Tyler Moy deep in the corner, second-line center Sean Malone retaliated.
Malone hammered O’Gara into the boards, but the officials missed the call as play rolled on with the Bulldogs’ star defenseman on the ground. Once he finally returned to his feet, O’Gara gave Malone a shove, then leveled the Buffalo Sabres draft pick with a cross-check to the head.
The hit led to a bit of a frenzy, as Moy shoved O’Gara before going after Wilson a few seconds later. The referees handed O’Gara a five-minute major and a game misconduct, while Moy also received a two-minute minor for roughing.
“I’m not blaming anybody, but the truth of it is, in hockey terms, that was their way of making a three-minute major as opposed to a five-minute major,” Donato said in reference to the officials’ call.
In the final seconds of Harvard’s power play, Kerfoot set up Blackwell for a one-timer from inside the left circle, but the potential equalizer sailed just over the bar as the penalty expired. Learned nearly capitalized on the miss, sprinting ahead on a breakaway after Yale gained possession, but Blackwell retreated and dove in the way, taking a penalty to thwart the chance. The Crimson escaped the next two minutes unscathed but failed to score over the final 6:10 to tie the game.
To earn sole possession of the Ancient Eight crown, Harvard now needs to beat Cornell in its final conference game of the year at the Bright in two weeks’ time, or else get help around the league.
“It’s tough to lose here, but ultimately we still control our own destiny in terms of the Ivy League,” Vesey said. “So we’re going to rebound.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—In his discussions with the team, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker often stresses two things—playing balanced offense and coming out hot in the first four minutes of each half.
One team did that on Saturday night, it just wasn’t Amaker’s.
After jumping out to a 7-0 lead in the first two minutes, the Crimson (9-13, 1-5 Ivy League) couldn’t maintain its level of play, falling to Penn (8-11, 2-3), 67-57. The game was Harvard’s fifth consecutive Ivy loss, and the fourth time the team has fallen by a double-digit margin since beginning conference play.
“I don’t think anybody expected this,” senior forward Patrick Steeves said. “You talk about us playing Kansas close, playing Oklahoma, getting to the final of the Diamond Head Classic. It’s crazy how it can kind of unravel.”
While the game was mostly close throughout the first half, Penn took a two-point lead from the locker room and widened the margin to nine with a 12-5 run in the first four minutes of the second frame. In the last sixteen minutes, the Quakers never relinquished the lead.
Penn kicked off the half with a layup from senior center Darien Nelson-Henry to put the Quakers up 29-25. A pair of free throws from sophomore forward Chris Egi and a one-for-two trip to the line from senior forward Agunwa Okolie pulled Harvard back within one, but junior guard Matt Howard negated the free throws with a three just under a minute later. Penn then went on a quick 7-2 spur, capped by another Howard jumper, before the U-16 timeout.
“Basketball’s a game of runs,” Amaker said. “You’re hopeful that you can have more than your opponent and certainly that was one that they had against us and got the lead.”
Throughout the game, Penn was able to run an inside-out offense through Nelson-Henry. Without junior forward Zena Edosomwan, the Crimson was outsized in the paint and unable to slow Nelson-Henry, as the senior ended the night with 18 points.
But the scoring went farther than Nelson-Henry. While the team shot just 22 percent from behind the arc, Penn was able to spread the floor, with Nelson-Henry, Howard, and freshman Max Rothschild all finishing with double-doubles. Freshman Jake Silpe tallied nine points of his own, including a three-point play to break the ice for the Quakers in the first half and a three at the 16:39 mark in the second to put Penn up nine early in the second frame.
The Crimson offense, on the other hand, found itself struggling to spread the floor without Edosomwan on the offensive end. The team finished with just 26 points in the paint, compared to 46 for the Quakers. When Edosomwan is on the floor, he is able to post up in the paint and occupy interior defenders, but the smaller frontcourt on the floor Saturday night relied more on drives and hook shots in the paint that failed to draw defenders away from outside shooters.
Outside the paint, Harvard struggled even more. Freshman guard Corey Johnson and junior guard Corbin Miller have been two of the Crimson’s hottest shooters this season, but on Saturday the duo shot a combined three-for-19 from deep. Johnson got off to a quick start in the first half, makes two triples in the first four minutes, but hit just one other trey in his remaining 27 minutes on the floor.
“When we get good, open looks by Corbin we want him to take them every time. If it rattles out, it rattles out,” Steeves said. “What is demoralizing is giving up an offensive rebound, silly foul, silly turnover that leads to two points on the break. If you take those out, we feel the game is going to be different.”
But the team was even more disappointed in its rebounding. Amaker and the Crimson have consistently emphasized that defense and rebounding set the tempo for the game. If the players are putting in consistent effort in those two areas, the coach preaches, offense will follow. While open shots weren’t falling, it was the lopsided rebounding that the team found more concerning. Without the league’s leading rebounder in Edosomwan, the Quakers outrebounded Harvard 53-32, led by 18 boards from Nelson-Henry.
With the loss, Harvard is tied with Dartmouth for last in the Ivy League, a place the five-time defending champion isn’t used to being.
“Everyone wants a piece of us, there’s no question,” Steeves said. “We’ve been running the league for a while and every time that these teams beat us, it means something to them. It should mean something to us to not let them do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s volleyball team, the Morgan Classic is an annual diagnostic—a two-game tournament that precedes EIVA conference play and tests the team’s readiness.
This season the Morgan Classic was also a test of patience. Inconvenienced by winter break and further inconvenienced by a late-January snowstorm that knocked out a matchup against Alderson Broaddus, the Crimson entered this weekend’s competition not having played a match in three weeks.
So was Harvard rusty or well-rested? The answer, after two games, was a little bit of both. Despite making the championship after a win over Puerto Rico Mayaguez, the Crimson (3-1) ultimately fell to hosting Springfield in five sets.
SPRINGFIELD 3, HARVARD 2
It had taken more tan two hours and 40 minutes to reach this point, but here it was: Captain and outside hitter Branden Clemens stepped to the line with the ball in his hands and the score tied at 13 in the fifth set.
A crowd of 1,100 watched as Clemens took off, leapt, and smashed the ball over the heads of his teammates, aiming for a vacant square-foot on the other side of the net.
But the ball never arrived. A service error gave Springfield (10-1) the point, and the hosts took the championship on the next play off a kill by Ricardo Padilla Ayala.
“We’re honestly dissatisfied,” Clemens said. “Not bringing home the trophy was definitely not ideal for us. We wanted to win that. I think it left us a little hungry.”
The drama of the 15-13 ending echoed the drama of the beginning, as the two teams started with a monstrous first frame that included 11 game points. After going into a tiebreak, Harvard had nine chances to take the set by winning a point, but in each case, the Pride rebuffed the effort.
Clemens had nine kills in the frame, part of a night in which he racked up 23 finishes and a game-high hitting efficiency of .556. Padilla Ayala led Springfield with 21 kills, and Greg Woods added 20.
The match appeared all but over by the end of the second game, when the Pride used a 6-2 run to clinch a 25-15 win and a 2-0 set score. But the Crimson clawed back, overcoming an early two-point deficit to take a 25-19 set.
In the fourth frame, Springfield mounted more of a fight and knotted the count at 14. Again, Harvard responded with renewed life—in this case a three-point streak that held up for a 25-21 game victory.
This resilience, and the associated fatigue, set the stage for the final set.
HARVARD, 3, PUERTO RICO MAYAGUEZ 1
This Friday against P.R.-Mayaguez, the end of the beginning truly seemed like the beginning of the end for the Crimson.
Coming off an unusual three-week break, Harvard had shaken off enough rust to take a 19-18 lead in the first set. But the Bulldogs responded by clinching the set with a seven-point run—and begging the question of how out-of-sorts the Crimson really was.
“Our timing was off,” senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman said. “We weren’t quite up to team speed right away. I think we were pretty inconsistent with our play.”
But a different narrative emerged over the next three sets, as Harvard squeezed through the second and dominated in the third and fourth to earn the match.
Clemens topped all players with 18 finishes, maintaining a streak of double-digit kill totals that stretches back to last season. However, defense was a large part of the Crimson’s success, as the team out-blocked P.R.-Mayaguez, 27-10.
Aside from the first set, the tensest moments occurred with the score locked at 24-24 in the second frame. With Harvard sophomore outside hitter Brad Gretsch serving, though, the Bulldogs committed a pair of errors to give away the game.
By contrast the Crimson deployed mid- and late-game runs in the third and fourth frames to cruise to 25-16 and 25-18 wins, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brimming with confidence after a victory against No. 8 Columbia, 5-4, on Saturday ended its three match losing streak, No. 7 the Harvard men’s squash team carried its momentum over to its match against No. 12 Cornell to close out the weekend.
Led by the exploits of sophomore Madhav Dhingra, the squad finished the weekend with two wins against ranked Ivy League competitors.
HARVARD, 8, CORNELL, 1
Unlike the previous day’s matches against Columbia, of which seven were 3-0 wins for either squad, the competition on Sunday at the Belkin International Squash Courts in Ithaca, N.Y. were more contested at the individual level.  At the team level, however, the narrative was quite different.
Harvard won the bottom eight of the nine-man ladder. Cornell’s lone victor, junior Harry Freeman, bested sophomore David Ryan in straight sets at the first position, 11-6, 11-7, 11-5.
The Crimson continues to own this matchup. Harvard’s 8-1 victory over Cornell (3-8, 1-4 Ivy) tied for its most decisive win since it last swept the Big Red in the 2005 season.
At position eight, sophomore Seif Eleinen was able to continue his unbeaten streak with a contested five-game win. After winning the first two games to take an early lead, Eleinen was unable to put away Cornell sophomore Laid Hare who took the next two games to tie up the match, 2-2. A prolonged fourth set, won by Hare, 16-14, was needed to force the fifth. The second-year player did not have to go the distance, however, as his opponent defaulted by injury just four points into the final game.
Sophomore Bradley Smith, having lost his last four contests at the No. 2 slot, was able to get out of his mid-season slump by picking up his first win since the squad’s match against Princeton four weeks ago.
It was Dhingra, however, who owned the weekend by adding another solid victory to the previous day’s success.
“Madhav performed well winning both of his matches in 4 close games and I think he will continue to improve which is key for us at a very important No. 4 position,” Koh said. “Overall, most of the guys managed to turn their losses into wins today which was fantastic.”
HARVARD, 5, COLUMBIA, 4
With its victory at the SL Green StreetSquash Center in New York City, the Crimson (4-4, 4-1 Ivy League) which has yet to lose to Columbia (4-4, 2-2 Ivy) since the Lions’ squash team earned varsity status in 2010, improved its all time record to 6-0.
Having been on the wrong end of 5-4 decisions three times already this season, Harvard was determined to change that narrative this time around after almost letting an early lead slip away.
“It certainly feels great finally grinding out a tough one,” junior co-captain Devin McLaughlin said. “We knew that it was the little things that could make a big difference for us…. After making some of these mental adjustments and coming out on top, we are certainly going to use that momentum to push us forward.”
The team edged the Lions in the final wave of matches as Dhingra’s decisive win, 3-1, at the No. 4 slot propelled his side to a hard fought triumph.
“[Dhingra] went down 1-0, but quickly refocused and was able to grind out a very tough four game win,” McLaughlin said “He showed real heart and determination in that match, and we were all really proud of him.”
Earlier in the day, the Crimson hit the ground running in the first wave with wins by sophomore Mandela Patrick, and junior co-captains Brian Koh and McLaughlin helping the squad pull out to a 3-0 lead.  Koh won by injury default after Lions sophomore Seif Attia retired in the second game of the match.
Columbia clawed its way back, however, to hold Harvard to a 4-2 advantage headed into the final three matches. A key victory, 3-0, by Eleinen preserved the Crimson’s lead and kept the squad from being swept in the second wave.
Losses by freshman Alexi Gosset at position three and Ryan at the first position set the final score. Ryan fell in straight sets to fellow sophomore Osama Khalifa, a finalist at the 2015 CSA Individual Championship in his freshman campaign for the Lions.

Chances are you just remembered that it's almost Valentine’s Day, and what you want more than anything is a significant other (unless you're one of the lucky few that's somehow managed to land a girlfriend/boyfriend in this barren land). However after coming to realize that that just won't be feasibly attained in the next week, your next best option is to throw a melty, dirty snowball at a happy couple. I mean come on, if you can't have love why should they.
Yes, Valentine’s Day is an awful holiday used to exploit those in relationships and depress those who are not, but there are ways to make it (slightly) less painful for singles.
Treat yourself
Go shopping with your friends, or alone if your credit card is your only real friend these days. If you think about it, you can spend all the money you would have had to spend on your significant other on yourself now. Because really, who deserves all your love more than you do? Buy yourself all the chocolate and flowers in the world because if you don't chances are no one else will.
Go out with your friends
Get all dressed up and show everyone that you are strong and happily independent. Your grandma will always love you, and will probably send you money inside of a romantic Valentine's Day card, so really who else could you ever need in your life?  But really, who wants to pay three times as much for a dozen roses when you can get three dozen roses for the same price on the 15th. Contrary to popular belief, fancy candlelit dinner for one does in fact taste just as good as fancy candlelit dinner for two. Wear all the new things you just maxed out your bank account buying and let everyone know that unlike them, you are more excited for a Monday off from classes than for Valentine’s Day.
Stay in with your friends
Order in or have a cooking night and take advantage of this great excuse to drink a ton of wine. If you tend to be more self-deprecating, watch The Notebook. Plan to buy each other gifts so you can each still feel special and celebrate the relationships that are probably going to outlive most of the couples out on dates.
Lana did say that the world was made for two, but that doesn't mean that all the singles out there can't find happiness in their own way. That being said, we here at Flyby with you better luck next year.

The GroupMe app has grown in popularity as one of the primary ways for people connect when they don’t have/don’t want each other’s numbers.  Most of us are a part of at least one GroupMe thread, either for a social organization, a collection of p-set buddies, or maybe just their group of friends. Flyby is here to provide you with a guide to be the best contributor to your GroupMe, effectively feeding your ego and providing you with a sense of validation.
Add GifsPeople love gifs. If you provide them with gifs, people will love you. That’s the end goal here. There are plenty of apps around where you can find the perfect gif for any situation or response. You might have to spend a long time pouring over all the different gifs in order to find the right one, but if you’re really dedicated, you should have plenty of time set aside for these tasks. What’s several hours a day in the grand scheme of things? Yes, maybe you could finish a pset in that time, but you could also dedicate it to making sure people think you’re funny.
Make Your Own MemesGroupMe even has a built in feature for this. They want to you excel in the realm of popularity and validation. Any picture can be made into a meme, but especially good options include: embarrassing photographs of yourself, embarrassing photographs of other people in the group, creepy pictures you took of someone when they weren’t looking, or blurry, low quality pre-made memes from 2005 that you found on the internet.
Reply OftenStatistically speaking, the more you reply to the group chat, the higher your chances are of saying something funny. Although you might not be the wittiest of the bunch, at least people will know your name. Even if they only know you as the “wildly unfunny try-hard.” All press is good press.
There you have it, folks. Try out these fail-safe tips and you’ll soon be the star of any group chat you’re added to, be it for a club, a blocking group, or a pset group. Happy GroupMe-ing!

Harvard has its fair share of technology troubles: Omni’s section of the dining hall menu (check it out for the full range of available drinks like “water” and “milk” in a dhall near you!), the tragic downfall of Harvard wifi at the start of this semester, or the “No Prediction” notice that shows up on the Rider app minutes before you’re planning to get on the shuttle to the quad. Recently, another attempt at utilizing technology to enhance Harvard students’ lives bit the dust: Ventfull.
For those who don’t read the UC’s emails, Ventfull was an event-planning app that publicized different happenings on campus, including the location of free food, open parties, and cultural events taking place each week. It was a good idea, but alas, in light of very low usage in the Harvard community, the smartphone calendar application ceased to exist in recent weeks. In its memory, Flyby has written an obituary for the event-planning creation that never really was:
Ventful, born just over a year ago, was a beautiful spam email and one-time phone download. When first created for the purpose of streamlining different events on Harvard’s campus, most students were apathetic or mildly excited, because notices from different email lists that everyone accidentally joins at the beginning of their freshman year are the highlight of any reasonable person’s morning. Indeed, the Harvard student population couldn’t wait to get on another list that would sit in their inbox unread. In the beginning, perhaps a few read Ventfull’s notices. A League of Legends viewing party? We're gonna pass on that one. But as the weeks passed, the Harvard community began to forget about the application. Ventfull’s “upcoming events” was marked as spam, and college students across campus resolved to spend another riveting Friday night without any sense of the outside world.
