After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Enda Walsh’s “Penelope” is not the first piece of Irish literature titled after a character who never speaks, nor is it the first to draw heavily from the works of Homer. Directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14, this production, which runs from April 25 to May 3 on the Loeb Mainstage, gleefully collides the sublime with the ridiculous, transporting a mainstay of world literature to a banal, seedy modern-day setting. In the able hands of its four main actors, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production pulls off the play’s comic elements without passing over the sense of unease at the play’s heart.
 Some 10 years after the fall of Troy, a scant four suitors remain prowling around the palace of Ithaca’s Penelope, fruitlessly attempting to win her affection. A prophecy foretelling the impending return of Odysseus––referred to throughout the play as merely “him,” a surprising amount of venom packed into one unassuming pronoun––drives them into a frenzy, and it isn’t long before their vows to work together fall by the wayside.
 In this telling of Homer’s lofty epic, the suitors are confined to the bottom of a drained pool and clad in speedos and cheap-looking bathrobes (if there was ever a time to produce a play in the Adams Pool Theatre, this would have been it). The staging is a celebration of the tacky: Party City hats, Pepto-Bismol-pink mylar balloons, and spilled cheetos are among the decorative elements on show. This reimagining of the setting lends the play a claustrophobic feel; tension mounts as the four actors pace about the maddeningly cluttered pool bottom on which they live, attempting to lay claim to a piece of territory. All the same, these choices aren’t entirely original. Both the costuming (by Gina K. Hackett ’15, an active Crimson editor) and the set design (by Madelynne A. Hays ’13) cleave pretty closely to those of the play’s premiere at the Druid Theatre in Galway. 
 Walsh’s play is full of long, meandering speeches and sometimes bizarre dialogue (the phrase “sensuous ninja” makes an appearance); short on real plot, it takes dramatic chops to contour the play’s long actionless stretches and prevent it from feeling rudderless. As the sleazy lounge lizard Dunne, David A. Sheynberg ’16 manages to trace a believable and heartfelt emotional arc for his character, everting stasis and adding depth to what could easily have turned into a caricature. And in the roles of Quinn and Burns respectively, Ben J. Marek ’14 and Matthew J. Bialo ’15  inject the play with some much-needed energy and tension, Bialo in the form of a taut-lipped frown and an eerily intense gaze, and Marek in the form of a bulldogish aggression, his jaw tensed and his neck veins popping. Of the play’s central quartet of characters, the least compellingly portrayed is Fitz (Teis D. Jorgensen ’14). Though his climactic declaration of love for Penelope, which lures her out of seclusion for the first time in the suitors’ decade-long seige, is endearingly plain-spoken, his overall characterization falls short of the standards set by this successful scene. Easily the oldest man there, Fitz’s age and his habit of pill-popping are the butt of many jokes from his rivals in love, yet nothing about him, from his upright posture and high, unmodulated voice to his seemingly sober demeanor, is reflective of this. The only indication of his age is the makeup job.
 An in-depth exploration of the performance of masculinity, “Penelope” offers viewers a compelling new take on Homer that is both unflattering and unflinching.

I know: by now even the literature professors are hoping the humanities will just kick the bucket already so we can finish talking about them—about how they’re dying, how they’re not really dying, how they already died in the 70s but nobody noticed, how the real reason they’re too sad to function is because the girls have left them.
  Writings about the humanities tend to divide along these lines: the humanities may get you a lower-paid job, and are important; and the humanities may get you a lower-paid job, and are unimportant. I’m interested, however, in how we can use the skills emphasized in the humanities to probe why we think it’s natural that some jobs should be paid more, and some paid less—beyond the obvious (and socially scientific) answer that that’s just how the market works.
 I don’t worry too much about my chosen field of study—and this is coming from a comparative literature and gender studies major whose schedule once included two poetry classes, a course on Modernism, and intensive introductory Italian. My comfort with this course of study, my conviction that I’ll be able to find an eventual career even if I’m paid less than my peers in engineering, is related to class. While a recent Harvard report found that full financial aid status has only a slight (negative) effect on eventual choice of humanities concentration for Harvard undergraduates, I’d wager it has a larger effect on the ease and confidence of that choice. It’s simpler to feel confident about employment prospects for English majors when you’ve grown up around examples of creative professionals making enough money to live comfortable lives, or when your parents and grandparents aren’t relying on you to support them. Choosing what to study, then, is an intimate negotiation with constraint. Because to a certain extent, it’s true: humanities graduates get paid less than their peers in engineering or the sciences—though do better than the alarmists would have you think. 
This doesn’t mean, however, that we should stop funding the humanities, or that passionate people should neglect the powerful work they want to be doing in Ethnic Studies to go on to become engineers. Rather, we can use the specific ability of the humanities to question aspects of culture that seem natural to think about the way we value—or devalue—specific types of labor. Sure, petroleum engineers get paid more than social workers because of the market economy. But the market economy is also a terrain of human values and unequal power; often, the Invisible Hand is visible, and a Koch brother’s. There are cultural reasons, as well as fiscal ones, why social workers might be paid so much less than, say, computer scientists: a devaluation of types of labor considered traditionally feminine, for example. This isn’t separate from an analysis based on economics: rather, the cultural and the structural construct one another. 
We can see this question of value, and how it plays out structurally, in the very way in which we talk about education. This is most evident, perhaps, in recent debates over compensation for teachers: American teachers are paid less than their peers with a similar educational background, or than their counterparts abroad, some argue, because of a cultural devaluation of education as a field. Harvard Law School Professor Annette Gordon-Reed makes a similar, though less culturally oriented, point about the structural problems of education funding in the New York Times, arguing that the economic pressures that dissuade students from studying the humanities don’t exist because the humanities are useless, or because they can’t help students get jobs. Rather, she points to rising tuition prices and student debt, implying that government divestment in public education (rather than, say, petroleum) is at least in part a matter of value: “We cannot have a realistic discussion of the state of the humanities in the United States without talking about the disinvestment in public education that is taking place at all levels of America’s educational system,” she writes. 
I’m not arguing that students who are responsible for economically supporting their families should be asked to unquestioningly accept Helen Vendler’s challenge to make “frugality seem as desirable....as affluence.” However, the tools offered us by the humanities can help us reframe the terms of the argument—to evaluate not what professions are paid more, but why we think this makes sense, and how we can imagine different sorts of value attached to labor. Natalia Cecire, a Yale postdoc in English, argues in a post on her blog that the humanities’ social change potential is too-often ignored: “It seems to me that when pundits deride the humanities as irrelevant, it’s because we aren’t, and that poses a threat.” One of the threats of the humanities is its ability to challenge the way we value labor itself.

Last Tuesday, the Supreme Court released its decision in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, which upheld a Michigan constitutional amendment banning the use of race-based affirmative action for public universities. The unfortunate decision needlessly disadvantages minorities in Michigan, who now face a constitutional amendment—rather than a more easily changed law—blocking affirmative action. It also opens the door to further bans in other states, which may collectively undermine minority access to education.
Michigan’s Proposal 2 passed in 2006 with 58 percent of voters in a referendum, responding to previous Supreme Court decisions allowing affirmative action. That proposal, when passed, amended the Michigan Constitution to ban the use of race-based affirmative action in any sort of public contact, including both college admissions, public employment, and contracting.
In upholding the amendment, Justice Anthony Kennedy’s plurality opinion concluded that it was not within the judiciary’s purview to circumscribe the will of a state’s people. As Kennedy wrote, “It is demeaning to the democratic process to presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds.” But the right of the majority to debate issues should not extend to making it more difficult for racial minorities to achieve protections through the political process. 
Although Justice Kennedy’s reasoning in the Schuette decision tries to avoid the issue of race, it is impossible to deny the role race plays in our country’s politics. Even a cursory look at the day’s headlines, with Clippers’ owner Donald Sterling’s banned from the NBA after an offensive recording was made public and Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy’s racist remarks, shows that racism remains an unfortunate reality.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s spirited dissent, which she read from the bench as a sign of her strenuous disagreement, correctly pointed out that the constitution ought to protect minority groups from the whims of the simple majority. Sotomayor rightly opposed the Court’s decision for “forcing the minority alone to surmount unique obstacles in pursuit of its goals—here, educational diversity that cannot reasonably be accomplished through race-neutral measures.”
States with existing affirmative action bans—like California and Florida—have seen precipitous drops in black and Hispanic enrollment in public universities. Despite the Court’s apparent skepticism, this trend demonstrates that affirmative action still serves a valid national purpose. Without it, minority access to education seems to suffer a crippling blow.
 Critics of affirmative action may point to "mismatch"—the phenomenon in which students are placed in an academic institution that is not commensurate with their personal educational background. Such a problem, however, may point not to issues with affirmative action itself, but to inequality in the nation’s educational system. States and the federal government should continue to look for ways to improve egalitarian access to public education, but we still have a duty to keep our institutions of higher learning diverse. Until minorities can attain equal educational access without it, affirmative action should remain the law of the land.

There are various pedagogical styles when it comes to testing. Some professors reluctantly hand out tests insisting they’re a necessary evil. Others aim to create difficult tests to differentiate between those who’ve mastered the material and those who’ve gotten the gist. And still others strive to create impossibly long exams to see how students optimize their time. However, I have never heard of a professor who insists that there is any educational value in confining test takers to small spaces that demand that they contort their bodies in seats with less legroom than economy class airplane seats and balance their tests, blue books, and calculators on attached desks smaller than standard pieces of paper.


These are precisely the conditions most Harvard students encounter while taking exams. Perhaps the reason the College hasn’t addressed the cramped, inhospitable test-taking environment it offers its students stems in part from a disinclination to discuss testing in general—teachers begrudgingly give tests, and students begrudgingly take them. Professors often say they wish they had means other than testing to assess students’ grasp of the subject matter, as many good students are not always adept at demonstrating their understanding on written tests. At the same time, professors also complain that students are often too preoccupied with their evaluations to take the time to appreciate the material.
But it’s time to start talking. The vast majority of exams at the college are given in the Science Center, Sever, and Emerson—three buildings that have immovable chairs with little legroom and attached desks that can barely hold a single bluebook. These desks severely restrict movement within the confined, rigid space, and are predominantly designed for right-handed people, giving left-handed people an additional disadvantage.


I acknowledge that time constraints are a legitimate means to assess whether students can think quickly and solve problems cleverly rather than rely on lengthy brute force methods. But this isn’t the case with spatial constraints. Writing on desks half the size of our exam booklets won’t distinguish the good writers from the bad ones, just as sitting in a seat in which tall people have no choice but to position themselves diagonally won’t distinguish between creative thinkers and rote learners.
Some may say it’s fair to disregard these physical discomforts, as they affect everyone equally. Some may say that students should simply learn to cope with this aspect of the test-taking experience as they would any other. But these physical discomforts disproportionally affect large students and students with attention deficit and hyperactive disorders. Someone who has bad eyesight and can’t see the clock can easily wear glasses and a wristwatch, but someone who feels uncomfortable in confined spaces can’t simply bring his own workspace to the exam room.
I propose that some class, perhaps Statistics 104, conduct an experiment to see how incommodious test taking environments affect students by randomly giving half the class an exam in a spacious environment and the other half the same exam in the standard environment. To determine whether there is a disproportionate impingement on certain populations, the experimenter should anonymously ask test takers for their height, weight, level of hyperactivity, and general level of attention, as well as other control factors such as gender, year, and concentration.
I understand Harvard may not have the resources to allow all students to take tests in reasonably sized, comfortable environments, but it is important to acknowledge the many problems of the current situation. In a school that prides itself on providing the best education and equalizing opportunity gaps whenever possible, Harvard hasn’t done a great job accommodating people with learning disabilities such as ADHD. The College should reach out to students and give them more opportunities to discuss their struggles, even if some may be reluctant to do so without prompting. Tests should measure effort, intelligence and creativity—not the ability to sit still in cramped spaces or stay organized at tiny desks.

One of the visiting students I met over the weekend said that Friday had been his first time on a plane. Harvard, like a number of other institutions, sponsors a program to allow low-income students to travel here for Visitas without paying out-of-pocket. This is one of the initiatives improving diversity at Harvard, paid for by donors like Kenneth Griffin ’89, who, earlier this year, announced a $150 million donation to the school, much of it earmarked for financial aid.
Without diminishing Mr. Griffin’s largesse, one of the structural factors that makes this donation possible is the longstanding preference in the tax code for charitable gifts that allows them to be tax-deductible. In effect, donors can redirect money away from the general federal budget and towards the causes or religious organizations that they support.
This preference, designed to spur American generosity, also speaks to the small-government ideal that average citizens might know how to spend their money better than elected officials, and that civil society can step it up to support its most vulnerable members. This is a narrative very appealing to many, including me. But it doesn’t always hold true.
Less than two years ago, hedge fund billionaire and Harvard Business School alum John Paulson ‘80 announced a $100 million donation to the Central Park Conservancy in New York City. Some of his other donations include $50,000 to the American Museum of Natural History on Central Park West, and more than $11 million to The Spence School, a private school, which, among other things, is notable for helping to inspire Gossip Girl, an American cultural treasure and hit television show.
No one can deny that funding parks and recreation is important, and I’m sure Mr. Paulson will appreciate the improved view.  Paulson has also made a number of donations, usually between $5,000 and $50,000, to community development organizations such as the Legal Aid Society.
But when adjusting for dollar value, many of the Paulson Family Foundation’s donations have gone towards causes that seem to benefit the Paulson Family. At least one of Paulson’s children has attended the Spence School, and other donations, like $50,000 to the ballet, go towards organizations he patronizes and which conveniently buy him some cultural capital, or at least, open the door for putting his name on a building somewhere.
The Spence School has 725 students, while the Legal Aid Society handles nearly 300,000 cases annually. According to the Deworm the World Initiative, which has been consistently named one of top charity rating service GiveWell’s top charities, there are hundreds of millions of children worldwide infected with parasitic worms and schistosomes, and many more at risk for infection. Each can be cured for less than $0.50. Even if the Paulson Family Foundation wants to focus on local issues, one in five children in NYC faces food insecurity. But the mitigation of human suffering doesn’t appear to be the first priority for the Foundation.
If taxes were really lowered, and ‘civil society’ were allowed to work its magic, would America’s poor and middle class really be better off? Or would more and more wealth flow to institutions catering to the elite, such as Harvard and the New York Ballet? From the behavior of donors like Paulson, it seems that social welfare programs might fall by the wayside if donors from the 1% were in the driver’s seat.
A study earlier this year looked at 288 Fortune 500 companies, and found that 26 of them paid no federal income taxes between 2008-2012, and 111 of the companies paid no federal income tax in at least one of those years. Meanwhile, tax code provisions that target the rich, such as preferences for capital gains, are reducing the tax rate that wealthy individuals pay. And the seemingly inexorable march towards wealth inequality continues.
And even if some of this money is flowing towards NGOs, it’s unclear if it’s being spent better than it would’ve been had the government administered the spending. In our excitement to run and praise the non-profit organizations and ‘social enterprises’ that work well, we sometimes forget that we are stepping over the graves of many more that have failed, unnoticed. For every Tesla that rolls off the lot, there’s a Chevy Volt sitting in a junkyard, or a concept that cost nearly a billion dollars without having been reified.
Many of the government programs reviewed in this column don’t work as well as they should. But it would be simplistic to say that this means government inherently doesn’t work. Rather, it’s a testament to the intractability of social ills that makes nuanced design and continued reevaluation critical for any program, whether housed in government, the private sector, or a non-profit. After all, there are no quick fixes.

We awoke to a thundering rain on the tin roof, accompanied by a chorus of livestock outside—the best alarm clock there ever was. Situated on the western edge of the Amazonian rainforest in Northern Ecuador, we were staying with a host family in an indigenous Kichwa community on the banks of the Arajuno River. Interspersed with the smell of saturated greenery and burning plastic, we witnessed a life that seemed a ghost of our own. Our papito was trained as a healer and our family subsisted off of food from their own backyard—the rainforest—so between the cacao, medicinal plants, and freshly-caught tilapia, we were living an locavore's dream. I saw my first fireflies in the blue light of the equatorial dusk. But between the hikes and organic food and endemic species, we also were given an idea of the larger issues looming over this ecosystem.
Less than a year ago, an underutilized airport was constructed in Tena to support travel to the nearby petroleum fields. While this brings jobs and income into a country with a high poverty rate, it also brings deforestation, indigenous displacement, and water table infiltration. Ecuador is the third largest exporter of petroleum in Latin America, and most of the existing and proposed sites are located in the Amazon rainforest.
 
Being a Harvard student abroad is an immensely educational experience. On the one hand, there are times when the cushy, brick-laden world of Cambridge feels like several worlds away, and academia a frivolous excuse for knowledge. There is so much to learn in countries where seatbelts are optional and drinking the tap water is ill-advised. Call it the bias of an anthropology concentrator, but I always find myself learning more about the world and myself when exposed to different ways of life.
 
But on the other hand, there are times when I am extremely grateful to have the tools to process these incredibly disparate realities. What does it mean to operate in a region with endemic biodiversity? What are the repercussions of neoliberal ideologies pushed by international corporations? Are we at all beholden to "preserve" resources and culture for future generations, or this a naive cover for enforcing societal stagnation? I may not have the answers to these questions, but at least I know how to ask them.

So it will be with some degree of skepticism that I return to campus this fall. Of course, part of me will be hungry for my classes, social circles, and even dining hall food (well, perhaps not that), but I find it useful to have an alternative discourse for comparison. After all, that is what a liberal arts education is supposed to be about.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This is part I of a two-part series on Harvard's proposed student honor code.
In fall 2012 when Harvard administrators investigated roughly 125 undergraduates for alleged plagiarism or inappropriate collaboration on a Government course’s final take-home exam, Harvard’s relationship with academic integrity came under increased scrutiny.
Longtime critics of the College and its disciplinary system raised their voices anew, questioning Harvard’s academic culture and its allegedly antiquated Administrative Board. A number of these detractors, both within the University and outside of it, called for Harvard to align itself with some peer institutions and their more formalized policies governing academic integrity.
Next Tuesday, over a year and a half after the cheating scandal spilled into the news, Faculty members are expected to vote on just that—a proposal to institute an honor code that would formally emphasize the College’s commitment to academic integrity. The code’s supporters point to peer schools’ existing systems as evidence that such a policy could work to cultivate a stronger culture of academic integrity at Harvard.
Yet, even as the honor code proposal and its call to involve student voice in the disciplinary process may represent a significant policy shift at the College, experts say that these proposed changes come much later, and perhaps go less far, than their age-old counterparts at peer institutions.
Still, while some members of the committee that drafted the proposal acknowledge its limited scope, they maintain that changes to Harvard’s disciplinary process must be incremental to be effective.
BEHIND THE TIMES
The Ad Board’s 1890 establishment makes it older than the House system, Widener Library, and Harvard Business School. The College’s primary disciplinary body has long been criticized, with detractors claiming that the board and its policies are outmoded.
The Ad Board is “almost a bit of an anachronism nationally,” said Gary Pavela, a former director of academic integrity at Syracuse University who has consulted other colleges on integrity issues.
After decades of only occasional changes in policy, the College’s proposal for an honor code, if approved, would eliminate most, if not all, academic dishonesty cases from the Ad Board’s jurisdiction with the creation of a student-faculty judicial board to hear alleged honor code violations. That “honor board” would bring student voice into the College’s disciplinary process for the first time.
Although such a change would be unprecedented for the College, Harvard’s proposal to engage students in its disciplinary process comes years behind many of its peers. Undergraduates sit on judicial boards or are involved in disciplinary proceedings in some form at every Ivy League school other than Harvard, and some such systems have been around for decades.
“By discussing a move from the system that’s currently in place to an honor code, it’s as if Harvard’s moved from the 1800s into the 1960s and 1980s, and so I suppose it’s a big step forward in terms of getting closer to modernity with the way one handles discipline cases,” said Peter F. Lake '81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law.
The 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s saw an increase in student involvement in college disciplinary processes across the country, according to Matthew Gregory, president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration and associate dean of students at Louisiana State University. He said that during that time period, it became increasingly common to see panels entirely composed of students.
Gregory attributed this increase in student engagement to the emergence of research by academics such as Alexander W. Astin that found that involving students in the disciplinary process could improve student retention rates and increase students’ satisfaction with their schools, among other benefits.
Not only would Harvard be late among its peers in providing student representatives on disciplinary bodies—the College is also late in instituting an honor code. Aside from Harvard and Yale, all Ivy institutions have adopted a formal code of honor or academic integrity. Princeton established its honor system just three years after Harvard created the Ad Board; Dartmouth and Cornell created their policies in 1962 and 1976, respectively.
More recently, a push by the Columbia College Student Council resulted in the implementation of an honor code this academic year, when members of the Class of 2017 were encouraged to collectively recite and sign a version of the code at a fall assembly, according to Nora Habboosh, an undergraduate and the academic affairs representative for the council.
LIMITED IN REACH
In public and private conversations about Harvard’s current proposal for an honor code, members of the Academic Integrity Committee have consistently pointed to peer institutions’ policies as justification for adopting a similar system at Harvard. They point to research to evidence the success of honor codes elsewhere.
 
Yet Harvard’s proposed policy, if approved, would have limited reach compared to those established by some of its peers. The Academic Integrity Committee’s proposal for a modified honor code purposefully does not require students to report peers who violate the policy, and maintains that examinations be proctored.
Harvard is not alone in this respect. Of schools in the Ivy League with honor codes or similar policies governing academic integrity, only Dartmouth and Princeton hold non-proctored exams, and only Princeton requires students to report their peers for cheating. Pavela, for his part, suggested that the requirement to report—characteristic of a traditional honor code—“doesn’t work.”
Still, Harvard’s proposed policy is also narrower in its jurisdiction than some peers. While some schools have honor systems that govern integrity outside of the classroom, Harvard’s proposed code and judicial board would affect only cases of academic dishonesty, as the Ad Board would continue to hear disciplinary cases outside of the honor board’s jurisdiction.
Schools such as the University of Virginia and the College of William and Mary have honor codes that establish student-only disciplinary bodies that administer cases of cheating, as well as cases of lying and stealing. Other schools, such as Haverford College, go even further, with honor codes and honor boards regulating most actions, including some peer dispute cases.
Even at institutions without honor codes, students play a larger role in the disciplinary process than they would under Harvard’s proposal. Undergraduates at Yale and MIT—neither of which have honor codes—hear all student misconduct cases, including peer disputes such as sexual assault cases.
Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who attended a high school with an honor code, suggested that involving student representatives on the Ad Board may make sense, and that including more student voice in such processes is usually better.
Lake suggested that Harvard “could do a lot more” to involve student voice in the disciplinary process—even beyond putting undergraduates on judicial boards that address misconduct beyond cheating. Lake suggested that colleges should involve students “in regular and periodic climate and assessment check[s]” and self-study their discipline systems at least annually with “meaningful student input.”
“[Harvard] may be missing an opportunity to use students more broadly in the management of the environment,” Lake said.
OPTING FOR A SMALLER CHANGE
Though several members of the Academic Integrity Committee acknowledged that the proposed honor code and student-faculty board has a smaller jurisdiction than it could, they suggest that this represents the appropriate level of reform for the time being.
Terah E. Lyons ’14, a student member of the committee and one of several to draft the language of the proposal, said that the committee has generally discussed creating a board that would hear more than academic integrity cases but decided against it. “I think it’s going to take some time to get to that point, if we ever do,” Lyons said.
She said the Academic Integrity Committee decided to restrict the honor board’s jurisdiction to academic integrity infractions primarily because involving student voice in that adjudication process is already a “huge change” for Harvard, considering how long the Ad Board has been an institution. Changes to the process will have to happen “incrementally” for them to work, she said.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who chairs the Academic Integrity Committee, wrote in an email that he agreed with the sentiment that such changes must be incremental to be effective, adding that stealing and lying—at least to a University officer—is already “strictly forbidden” in the Harvard College Handbook for Students. “We are simply not choosing to change the way we engage with those matters at this time,” Harris wrote.
Lyons added that sensitivity is an issue when considering the process for hearing sexual assault cases.
Mayopoulos said he understands the desire to address academic integrity issues first and perhaps expand the program later. Still, he called academic integrity “not the most important integrity we deal with at this school.”
“I understand there are restraints,” Mayopoulos said, “but having an honor code and an honor board that deals with more than just academics would be preferable.”
Michael C. Ranen, the freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard who sits on the Academic Integrity Committee, recognized that the committee’s proposal lacks the requirement to report of some of its peers, but suggested that the proposal was written with the goal of gaining the support of the entire community. He added that the honor code is a “living document.”
“I think this honor code should be and will be reviewed, and I think in a few years tweaks may be made,” Ranen said.

This is part III in a three-part series. Part I ran in The Crimson’s Commencement Year in Review issue last May and was reprinted on April 28. Part II ran on April 29.
When Karina A. Partovi ’14-’15 looks out the window of her Eliot dorm room at the Anderson Memorial Bridge, all she sees is a bridge.
She looks out at the stone ledge perched above the rushing waters of the Charles without thinking back to that November night more than three years ago when she sat on that ledge, stared into those waters, and prepared to take her own life.
“It’s just there now,” Partovi said. “It’s not an enemy.”
After contemplating suicide, Partovi took a leave of absence from Harvard and returned to her home in San Diego, where she saw a therapist, worked at a local elementary school, and spent time with her family.
Now, she’s back on campus, once again thrust into the fast-paced life of a Harvard undergraduate.
Partovi is not alone. Students who have gone home for mental health reasons say they came back to Harvard with a new approach to addressing the difficulties of campus life, better equipped to make the most of their Harvard experiences. After spending time divorced from the University for mental health reasons—striving to heal and demonstrating their stability to Harvard—students are excited to return to campus, ready to take on the challenges of an undergraduate once more.
‘YOU’RE COMING BACK’
When Partovi came down from the edge of the Anderson bridge after her suicidal thoughts had subsided, her freshman resident dean gave her a choice.
“My options were—and I don’t mean to sound ungrateful—my options were: you can either leave willingly or be forced out,” Partovi said. “But [then-Ivy Yard Resident Dean William Cooper ’94] also made clear, which I didn’t appreciate it at the time because I was angry and hurt and very very scared and overwhelmed, he did say that we’re not kicking you out forever, you’re coming back, you just shouldn’t be here right now.”
Partovi, choosing to not mar her record with a forced withdrawal, elected instead to take a leave of absence. Cooper escorted her back to her dorm, supervised her as she packed, and ensured that she was off campus the next day. Cooper, who has since departed the position and now works as associate dean of student life at the College, declined to comment for this story.
Now, more than three years after the night on the bridge, Partovi is once again eating in dining halls, sitting in lectures, and otherwise being a student at Harvard. But unlike most students, she and others who took time off for mental health reasons undergo an extensive process to demonstrate that their mental health—and not merely their personal or academic achievements—will allow them to thrive at Harvard.
Usually after a student takes a leave of absence, University Health Services sets guidelines to facilitate his or her successful return. Those guidelines instruct students to seek out help from a mental health professional during their time off and involve themselves in a structured activity—through a job, volunteer work, or taking a class—typically lasting a period of six months.
According to several students interviewed for this story, students are told to collect letters of recommendations from their mental health professional and someone familiar with their structured time and submit those documents to UHS for review. In addition, UHS professionals conduct interviews with students before they intend to return to campus, usually through an in-person interview at the UHS facilities in the Holyoke Center.
According to Secretary of the Administrative Board, John “Jay” L. Ellison, a representative from UHS compiles the information gathered from the letters and the interview and makes a recommendation to the Ad Board. After reviewing this information, the body votes on whether the student is fit to return to college life.
When George, who took time off for mental health reasons in fall 2012, flew to Cambridge last July for his UHS interview, his interviewer all but assured him that he would be readmitted, saying that only a handful of people that she interviewed were eventually rejected by the Ad Board.
“It wasn’t a very long interview; it was only ten, 15 minutes long,” said George, whose name has been changed given the sensitive nature of this topic. “I know it was necessary, and I’m sure she got useful information from it, but it felt a little bit like a formality more than anything else.”
Kate, who was placed on leave for mental health reasons, said the financial cost of travelling to Cambridge for an in-person interview can be burdensome for some students. “If I were an international student or a student from California, I just couldn’t imagine it,” said Kate, whose name has also been changed.
But after a long process of collecting letters of recommendation and communicating with UHS, most students who take time off for mental health reasons return to campus, bringing with them not only their bags and possessions but also a new perspective on college life.
HARVARD, TAKE TWO
When Partovi returned to campus after her leave of absence, she came back to the same routine she left nearly a year earlier—the same Opening Days, the same Community Conversations, and the same freshman year. Yet she arrived as a different person, with a different approach to living the life of a Harvard student, and even a different name.
Instead of her first name, Karina, Partovi began introducing herself outside of the classroom as Todd, the name that her mother had often used when she was a child.
“I didn’t want to be the person I was before,” Partovi said. “I was very ashamed of myself—I felt like there was a black cloud over my head.”
Students like Partovi say that taking time away from campus helped them gain perspective and better take on their Harvard experience, reinventing their priorities as college students.
“I think I grew up a lot and coming back I could handle Harvard a lot more,” said Ella, whose name has also been changed. “I know why I’m here, and I know what I want to get out of Harvard so it makes things a lot simpler and less overwhelming.”
Kate said that the process of taking a leave of absence and paying for her own therapy changed the way she approaches the challenges of life as a Harvard student.
“I would say that apathy is generally a bad trait for a student, but I think for a lot of Harvard students, it can be a good trait,” Kate said. “Now if I have a midterm, I’m substantially less stressed because having to study for a midterm is not the same stress as having to find out how to pay for treatment.”
Ella, who also took time off for mental health reasons, was unsatisfied with her concentration choice and had struggled to select appealing classes when she left Harvard in the middle of her sophomore year. But when she came back to Cambridge after her leave of absence, she was already determined to switch her concentration and was looking forward to her new academic path.
“I was really happy to be taking classes...and I actually enjoyed them,” Ella said of the first semester she was back from her leave. “I was doing what I really wanted to do.”
NO LONGER THE ‘BAD TEXTER’
Before George took his leave of absence, he was known as the “bad texter” by his friends, choosing to ignore text messages from them sometimes for days.
But after taking a leave plagued with bouts of loneliness, George has returned to Harvard with a new outlook on his social connections.
“I’m much better about writing people back now and making sure that I take the time to visit with people…. You have to work to get into relationships and maintain them, even in an environment like this,” George said. “I think those relationships are a lot stronger than they may have even been if I had spent ‘x’ many months more with them.”
Like George, other students who take time off for mental health reasons come back to campus with a new view of social connections, reevaluating their friendships and personal priorities.
After she returned, Ella similarly restructured her relationships and how she spent her time with the insight of her year off.
“I think coming back what I did differently from previous times is that I learned to be around people who are nurturing and just not spend time with people who I didn’t want to be with,” Ella said. “I cut down my friend groups a lot and spent times with the ones who were most important.”
But starting next semester, both George and Ella face the prospect of spending their senior year without many of their friends who will be graduating this spring.
“I’m a little bummed out that when they graduate, I’ll come back [to school] and all my friends will be dispersed around the world,” Ella said.
While Ella said that she has already made the transition to make her classwork what “grounds” her at Harvard, George is not so confident that he will be able to meet new people to fill his social circle.
“One problem I have with Harvard that I’ve accepted a bit more is that I haven’t found it to be such a welcoming social environment,” George said. “You know, you meet people through groups but if you don’t start joining groups early in your career, you don’t get to know that many people. There aren’t that many opportunities to meet new friends.”
George says that having to make new friends is a source of concern for him as he prepares to enter his last year at Harvard. “When I get stressed out next year, am I going to have the sort of the company of people who I care about, who I can say I really like their friendship[s] or will I be more on my own?”
Despite the uncertainty ahead, George and many others say that in the end, after navigating a complicated process of going home, getting better during a leave of absence, and coming back to Harvard, their time off was instrumental in their college lives.
“Given the way that things did play out, I think I can say that I don’t have any regrets,” George said. “I don’t know the type of person and student that I would have become if I hadn’t taken time off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New U.S. Department of Education guidelines released in tandem with a White House report on campus sexual violence could put pressure on Harvard to evaluate its sexual assault policies and procedures, even as the Office for Civil Rights is reviewing the University’s proposed revisal of those same regulations.
The documents outline recommendations and Title IX policy guidelines for properly addressing sexual violence at colleges at universities across the country. Formally released on Tuesday, they come two weeks after University President Drew G. Faust announced that Harvard had submitted a revised sexual assault policy to the OCR for review.
For Harvard in particular, the OCR guidelines and the White House report’s recommendations could be in tension with current evidence standards for sexual misconduct cases, choice of Title IX coordinators, and the extent to which administrators have involved students in the reevaluation of University policies.
Peter F. Lake '81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said that there is a “tremendous amount to digest” in the reports.
“I think it really emphasizes that the intensity of federal intervention in sexual misconduct issues on campuses [has] ramped up to as high a level as it’s ever been in American higher education history,” Lake said. “This sets a new bar for how much the federal government is willing to throw into this issue.”
CLARIFYING THE GUIDELINES
In a 53-page document, OCR provided renewed guidance on handling Title IX grievances, emphasizing that “any procedures used for sexual violence complaints, including disciplinary procedures, must meet the Title IX requirement of affording a complainant a prompt and equitable resolution...including applying the preponderance of the evidence standard of review.”
Although the “significant guidance document” does not hold the force of law or add additional Title IX requirements, it provides information on how OCR will evaluate whether or not a college is compliant with Title IX regulations. The office is currently investigating the handling of sexual assault cases at both the College and Harvard Law School.
The preponderance of the evidence standard—which requires more than 50 percent certainty to determine guilt—has been adopted for sexual assault cases by many of Harvard’s peer institutions. Currently, cases before the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body, must meet the “sufficiently persuaded” standard, believed by some to be a higher burden of proof than the standard recommended by OCR.
Prior to the release of the documents Tuesday, OCR had expressed its preference for the preponderance of the evidence standard in its 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter.
The OCR documents make further recommendations regarding Title IX coordinators, suggesting that the job responsibilities of athletics directors, deans of students, and employees serving on judicial boards that hear sexaul assault case appeals may conflict with Title IX coordinator responsibilities.
Harvard has a full-time, University-wide Title IX officer, as well as coordinators at individual schools, several of whom serve as deans outside of their Title IX responsibilities.
The two Title IX coordinators at the College, William Cooper ’94 and Emily J. Miller, are an associate dean of student life and a case manager of the Ad Board, respectively. As case manager, Miller is not a member of the Ad Board, and she recuses herself from working on Ad Board cases that she has previously addressed in her capacity as a Title IX coordinator.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s revised policies, recently submitted to OCR, “are designed to meet the requirements of all applicable federal laws, several of which have been recently updated.”
“As soon as Harvard receives appropriate feedback from OCR, we will move to implement the new policy,” Neal wrote.
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT
The Department of Education documents were released alongside the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault’s concrete recommendations for colleges in preventing and responding to sexual assault on campus. The task force recommends that schools develop a “climate survey” on sexual assault on campus and students’ awareness on this issue, among other points in the report.
The White House report also addressed the issue of student input in a checklist for sexual misconduct policies. In that checklist, the task force recommended that schools “[i]dentify key stakeholders—particularly students, concerned student groups…—whose expertise and input should be incorporated into the drafting process.”
The recently-submitted revised policy that Faust announced two weeks ago is the result of a working group, convened last May by University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides to evaluate Harvard’s policies and those policies’ compliance with Title IX.
Since the creation of that working group last May, some student activists have raised concerns over the level of student input solicited for the policy evaluation. Though no undergraduates sit on the policy working group, Neal wrote in an emailed statement that Karvonides has had meetings with “students who wanted to talk first hand about their experiences, advocates, and the previous [Undergraduate Council] leadership” since she took her position in spring 2013.
“She has kept these conversations and other sources about student views in mind as she has approached the work of the policy working group,” Neal wrote.
Faust announced the formation of a presidential task force on sexual misconduct, to be chaired by former University Provost Steven E. Hyman, in early April. Though three students—two of them undergraduates—will sit on that task force, the group is not charged with making any policy change decisions.
Kate J. Sim ’14, an organizer for the student activist campaign Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she hopes that the White House report will put pressure on Harvard to involve more student voice.
“I certainly hope that federal pressure will encourage Harvard to be proactive about creating a safer and a more just campus,” said Sim, who has also been involved with Title IX-related advocacy at the national level. But Sim added that she is “cautiously optimistic about the direction Harvard will be taking” considering the actions of peer institutions, such as Tufts.
OCR determined this week that Tufts’s policies were in violation with Title IX, and Tufts then released a statement on its website saying that “the department’s recently announced finding has no basis in law.”

The number of young people planning to vote in upcoming midterm elections has declined to 23 percent, marking an 11 percent drop since the last poll in fall 2013, according to a survey released Tuesday morning by Harvard’s Institute of Politics. In light of this number, IOP Polling Director John Della Volpe predicted the lowest voter turnout among millennials in the November midterm elections since 2000.
The national poll, conducted biannually by the IOP, surveyed 3,058 members of the millennial generation—young Americans aged 18 to 29—on a range of political and social issues, including trust of different government branches, support for the legalization of marijuana, and opinion of Hillary Clinton and  Chris Christie.
“The Institute’s spring poll shows 18-to 29-year-olds’ trust in public institutions at a five-year low–and their cynicism toward the political process has never been higher," IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 wrote in a statement.
Alexander A. Wirth ’15, student chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, the student-led group responsible for the IOP survey, said he was surprised by millennials’ distrust in government.
“For the first time since we’ve been polling, a majority of young Americans don’t have trust in a single government institution,” Wirth said.
Only 20 percent of respondents said they trusted the federal government to do the right thing. Trust in President Barack Obama, Congress, and the National Security Agency stood at 32, 14, and 24 percent, respectively.
Obama’s approval rating among millennials increased from 41 percent when the last poll was conducted five months ago to 47 percent now, marking a higher approval rating among young people than across all demographics. Despite this rise, young Democrats said they are are less enthusiastic about voting than Republicans. Of those who voted for Mitt Romney in the 2012 Presidential Election, 44 percent said that they plan to vote in the upcoming midterm elections in November. Meanwhile, 35 percent of previous Barack Obama voters said they plan to cast a ballot in the upcoming elections.
The poll illustrated a disparity in opinion between younger millennials and older millennials on the legalization of marijuana. Of those aged 18 to 24, 39 percent oppose legalization, compared to 38 percent who supported it. Of those aged 25-29, 50 percent support legalization, with just 28 percent opposing it.
The IOP poll also found that 64 percent of millennials believe that the income gap between the “rich and everyone else in America” has increased in their lifetimes. Many more Democrats than Republicans believe that such a gap is the result of “factors outside one’s control,” at levels of 44 percent compared to 29 percent. Republicans, meanwhile, were more likely to credit the gap to “certain people working hard and making smart choices.”
Wirth also said that the poll shows a change in millennials’ views on foreign policy and military action abroad.
“We  saw a nine percentage-point drop in the number of younger Americans who agree that sometimes it’s necessary to attack potentially hostile countries rather than waiting until we are attacked to respond,” he said.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office plans to replace the current online course catalog in the fall of 2015 with a more efficient, user-friendly catalog equipped with tools to help students track their degree progress and cross-register for courses, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke.
The move is part of a larger plan to launch a centralized student information system, which will provide one online platform for students across all 12 Harvard schools to make payments and register for courses, among other tasks.
According to Burke, the catalog will include improved key term and categorical searches akin to an internet search bar. Though the creation of the catalog is still in what Burke calls a “speculative phase,” students will eventually be able to narrow their searches to include only courses during a desired day or term. They will also be able to filter searches according to which Harvard school offers the course.
“The new system will give us some new opportunities for looking up courses, and browsing online,” Burke said. “It’s going to be a better experience than just looking at chapters and reading from top to bottom.”
Burke said that with this new search system, students will be able to determine whether the courses they have searched will count toward their degree.
“So you can build scenarios and ‘what if’s?’” Burke said. “And conversely if you are not eligible to take a course, [the catalog] will tell you too.
The move to a completely redesigned course catalog marks the first significant change to the catalog since 2009, when the University stopped printing course catalogs, along with student and faculty handbooks and the Q guide, to save tens of thousands of dollars in printing and mailing costs. Before moving online, the catalog could be as lengthy as 800 plus pages, according to Computer Science professor and former dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68.
Some faculty members expressed concern that enabling students to search by keyword may not emphasize the exploratory aspect of searching for courses.
“You need to know what sort of keywords you are going to look for,” said anthropology Director of Undergraduate Studies Richard H. Meadow. “If you haven’t ever thought about looking for a course about food, you’d never look for food.”
He added that he thinks this keyword search function will change the types of questions that faculty members ask themselves when they present their courses in the catalog. 
 
“How am I going to better present my course material in a way that it’s going to be found by someone using these different sorts of searches?” he said. “What sort of really high-profile words am I going to include in their titles and their descriptions that will catch students’ attention?”
Burke however, noted that students will still have the option to browse courses by scrolling through pages and lists of courses in the catalog—as they can do now.
Although Lewis noted that he is “modestly nostalgic” about the end of the current course catalog, he said he thinks the transition to the new version will not significantly affect students’ experience searching for courses.
“I’m not particularly worried about the new catalog having all kinds of searching and indexing and ranking features that people can misuse because it’s technology,” Lewis said. “You can always misuse technology but that’s not the reason not to have technology, it’s just a reason to try to figure out ways to slow people down and think more about the choices they are making and how they are making them.”

UPDATED: April 30, 2014, at 2:40 p.m.
At a meeting of the Harvard Graduate Council last Tuesday, students passed a resolution to expand M2 shuttle service to include Sunday operations.
The M2 shuttle, which connects the Harvard Longwood and Cambridge campuses, currently runs during the week and on Saturday. The Medical School, School of Dental Medicine, School of Public Health, and many hospitals affiliated with Harvard are located in the Longwood area.


Students have previously proposed expanding M2 shuttle service to include Sunday operations, but have never successfully passed a resolution to effect the proposal. The resolution passed last week marks the first concrete step towards permanently increasing shuttle service.
Members involved with the resolution plan to send a formal letter to University President Drew G. Faust this week to request a meeting with her during the coming months.
“We are hoping to...get her support to relocate necessary funding to finance the Sunday shuttles,” said Ruby B. Kwak, who serves as vice president of advocacy on the Medical School Student Council and co-wrote the M2 resolution. “Once the funding is secured, we will work closely with the pertinent departments at Harvard and MASCO, the company that currently runs the M2 shuttles, to implement the expanded schedule by the end of this year.”
According to Kwak, who is also a senator for the Harvard Graduate Council, the administration estimated that Sunday shuttle service will cost an additional $50,000 annually. 
J. Bradley “Brad” Segal, president of the Medical School and School of Dental Medicine Student Council, however, noted that the cost should not outweigh the benefits of having a united Harvard community.
“At the end of the day, it's a question of who at Harvard University is actually willing to substantiate One Harvard by providing the financial support for Sunday M2 services,” Segal said. “One Harvard is something that should apply every day, not just Monday through Saturday.”
Kwak also said she believes that the shuttle issue extends to the One Harvard principle.
“We are all under one roof despite the fact that we are separated by some distance,” Kwak said. “People in Longwood felt really separated from Cambridge campus, and it was hard for them to feel connected to the rest of the University.”
Segal agreed, saying that students who study and work in Longwood deserve to remain involved in the life of the Harvard community at the center of campus—even on the weekends.
Expanding shuttle service has received widespread support from students, according to a survey launched by Kwak in November.
In a response pool of 585 Harvard students on the Longwood campus, 98 percent of respondents said that they would “support the initiative to have the M2 shuttles run on Sunday,” and 98 percent also said they would prefer the M2 shuttles over MBTA transit on Sundays.
Specifically, when students listed their top three reasons for using the M2 shuttles, they cited access to University resources as their first priority. They also ranked the benefits of having Sunday shuttles and indicated economic and safety benefits as most important.
“The results from the survey indicate that University-run free shuttles on Sundays are more of a necessity than a matter of convenience,” Kwak said.

University Title IX coordinator Mia Karvonides enumerated the ways in which Title IX regulations and recommendations provide a “toolkit” for addressing sexual violence policy and prevention in K-12 education during a public event at the Graduate School of Education Tuesday.
Director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Alicia Oeser, Graduate School of Education lecturer Richard Weissbourd, and 2012 School of Education graduate Tim H. Argetsinger also fielded questions from attendees about the implementation of policies and dismantling rape culture.
 Karvonides spoke to a crowd of 40 during her keynote address about her administrative and legal experience in analyzing sexual assault and harassment policy, which she described as “a complex and difficult area.”
While Karvonides said the media often focuses on sexual assault at the post-secondary education level, her goal is to encourage people “to take a broader view of these issues.”
Her address came a day after the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights released a question-and-answer document about what Title IX requires of school officials and administrators while the White House task force on sexual assault launched a new website to provide additional resources.
Karvonides emphasized that educators need to understand the anti-discriminatory act and guidance documents in order to effectively form policies. And when those policies are created, she said she could not “stress enough” that information and conversations need to be age-appropriate.
In addition, Karvonides repeatedly conveyed the role that data must play in any policy.
"If your school has data about your student population, that's fabulous,” she said. “If they don't, I would encourage you to advocate for collecting data to better understand your student population.”
After providing her recommendations, Karvonides and the other panelists answered questions about how to best begin a conversation about sexual assault and empower students to be vocal.
Oeser said one of the first steps is getting the administration to understand the significance of existing problems and to create an institutionalized response to them. She also emphasized the role of peer education.
“Peer culture is really important…. Part of the reason it is hard for us to have a significant conversation is because it’s not happening at a peer-to-peer level,” Oeser said.
Even so, Argetsinger, speaking from his experience as a hotline counselor for a rape crisis center, said individuals can be discouraged from speaking up by a repeated lack of responses.
"People who are survivors are really aware that peers who have spoken out in the past have received no justice,” Argetsinger said.
While panelists often kept their discussion of policy, resources, and prevention not specifically tied to Harvard, Kimberly P. Fernandes, a School of Education student and co-organizer of the event, said that their conversation is an “important starting point” to responding to growing concern over the University’s policies.
The dialogue with Karvonides follows increased campus dialogue on sexual assault in recent weeks. In response to a Title IX complaint submitted last month by at least one member of the undergraduate organization Our Harvard Can Do Better, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights confirmed this week that it will be opening an investigation into the College’s handling of sexual assault cases.

Harvard’s smallest school, the School of Dental Medicine, aims to raise $8 million in the University’s capital campaign, the School announced at its campaign launch at the Harvard Club of Boston last Thursday. 
 
The School’s goal represents about .1 percent of the University-wide goal of raising a record-breaking $6.5 billion by 2018. The University launched its campaign last September, following a three-year quiet phase of selecting priorities and gauging donor interest.
Wanda Mock, the Assistant Dean for Development and Alumni Relations at the Dental School, said that the Dental School’s involvement in the larger University-wide campaign helps to draw “more awareness to [our] whole campaign than if we were just to have a campaign on our own.”
According to the Dental School’s website, its campaign funds will be distributed across two priorities: $6 million toward boosting financial assistance for student scholarships and fellowships and $2 million toward supporting local and global public oral health programs.
“We want to attract the best and the brightest students, but we don’t have the funds to be able to offer many of them a competitive financial aid package,” Mock said. “Because of their debt burden many of our students are unable to follow their passion.”
More than 75 percent of Harvard dental students per year typically receive financial assistance through a combination of federal, private, and school funding. Tuition at the school is currently $54,200 per year, but total costs can rise as high as $100,000, according to the School’s website.
On its campaign webpage, the School has listed a set of requirements for prospective donors. To establish a named, endowed scholarship or fellowship, a donor must contribute a minimum of $250,000, while a named laboratory requires a donation of $500,000. The website also lists required donation levels to create named professorships, named spaces in the school’s Research and Education Building, and an endowed fund for dental students.
Many other schools at Harvard, including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Business School, and the Divinity School, have also launched their campaigns. The Medical School and Kennedy School of Government still have yet to launch a campaign.

CORRECTION: May 4, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the percentage of the overall University capital campaign goal for which the School of Dental Medicine accounts. In fact, its goal is .1 percent of the University's overall goal.

Harvard Law School appointed Esme Caramello ’94 and Christopher T. Bavitz to the position of clinical professor of law, the school announced last Friday.
Members of the clinical faculty teach clinical courses at the Law School and typically continue to practice law, providing students with hands-on legal experience under the mentorship and guidance of practicing attorneys.
Caramello, a graduate of the College and the Law School, has served as a lecturer on law and deputy director of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau.
Before returning to the Law School, Caramello worked as a litigation associate at Baker & McKenzie, and later Holland & Knight, and clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Charles P. Kocoras.
“Esme’s experience in tenants’ rights is second to none,” Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said in a press release.“Her strategic approach ensures that the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau will continue to lead in vital work.”
Bavitz, whose intellectual interests focus on intellectual and digital property rights, currently serves as the managing director of the cyberlaw clinic, which is housed within the school’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
“Chris has been instrumental in the success of the Cyberlaw Clinic, is a devoted teacher and mentor, and a wonderful colleague to work with,” said Urs Gasser, the Berkman Center’s Executive Director and a professor of practice at the Law School, in a press release. “The Berkman Center community is delighted about Chris’s appointment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 1, 2014, at 4:08 p.m.
Harvard University Police detained an unidentified white male unaffiliated with the University in the foyer of Lamont Library around 3 p.m. Wednesday after receiving a report that he was acting suspiciously, having been denied access to the library and in possession of a knife.
The man in question was trying to enter Lamont to reach his girlfriend, who worked there, and with whom he had had a dispute minutes earlier as they moved from an unnamed local high school toward Harvard’s campus, according to reports filed by the Cambridge Police Department Wednesday evening.
No charges were ultimately pressed, according to Jeremy Warnick, director of communications for CPD, though the man in question was removed from the scene in handcuffs.
The reports show that the woman, who is not a Harvard student, was trying to break up with the man at the time of the dispute. As the two individuals left the high school, they were joined by a second man, identified in the report as a friend, who pushed the first man off of his bike and then threw it at him.
The woman fled the scene to Lamont, where after a second altercation with her boyfriend, she made it inside the building to call police. According to the CPD police reports, she was in “fear for her self.”
CPD was notified of the first altercation involving a bike around 2:40 p.m. and then about the incident at the library by HUPD around 3:11 p.m.
After detaining the boyfriend in the lobby of Lamont, HUPD officers escorted him in handcuffs to an ambulance on Quincy St. shortly after 3:30 p.m. According to the CPD reports, the man sustained a cut and a small bruise on the back of his head from the bike altercation.
Library and HUPD officials declined to comment at the scene at Lamont or offer the name of the detained individual, whose shirt was unbuttoned and hands were cuffed behind his back.
Officials taped off the main entrance to the library for a little more than half an hour and directed students to enter and leave the building through the building’s Pusey entrance.
A custodial worker for the library confirmed that he was cleaning up drops of blood on the floor near a bench where the individual was held by authorities before being removed. The foyer was fully reopened around 4:35 p.m.
Police were seen handling a plastic bag containing a knife and belt shortly after. Warnick said that no one was stabbed.
Two students working at the library’s circulation desk said that while they did not see the individual in question before the police arrived, they heard increased levels of noise once authorities were on the scene.
“There was some shouting, there [were] some loud voices,” said Kelsey L. Hunt ’14, one of the two students working at the desk.
Even so, several students who were in the library while the incident occurred said that they were unaware that it had happened.
“I think most people didn’t even have a clue anything was happening,” said Sarani M. Jayawardena ’17, who was doing schoolwork in Lamont at the time of the incident.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By virtue of its Ivy League regular season title, the men’s lacrosse team will play host to the Ivy League Tournament this weekend with a trip to the NCAA Tournament on the line.
The four-team bracket kicks off on Friday at Harvard Stadium, when second-seeded Cornell (11-3, 5-1 Ivy) will take on third-seeded Penn (9-3, 4-2).
Following that contest, top-seeded Harvard (9-5, 5-1) will take on fourth-seeded Yale (9-4, 3-3) under the lights in a rematch of the game that clinched a share of the Ancient Eight regular season title for the Crimson, its first since 1990.
“Our defense has got to try to stop their offense; they’re really good offensively,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “There’s really nothing that we’re trying to do differently [from the last meeting], just trying to do everything that we do better.”
While Harvard’s 11-10 win over the Bulldogs last week was certainly historic, the upcoming game between the two archrivals could prove even more significant.
With both teams currently on the bubble for potential bids into the NCAA Tournament, the loser of Friday’s game will likely be denied a place in the 18-team field.
This win-or-go-home atmosphere only serves to increase the stakes of the matchup in what has been one of the strongest years for the conference in recent memory.
All four tournament teams are ranked in the top 20 nationally, and while the Crimson may have earned the first seed in the league tournament, its number 12 ranking in the latest national poll makes it just the third-best team in the Ivy League in the eyes of the media.
Although different scenarios abound, the only sure way for Harvard to earn itself a spot in the NCAA Tournament will be to win the Ivy League Tournament and thereby capture the league’s automatic qualifier.
While the league as a whole has an outside chance to receive as many as three bids, the scenario remains unlikely, given the surplus of quality teams around the nation vying for a berth in postseason play.
The last time the Ivy League had three teams in the NCAA Tournamentfield was 2009, when Brown, Princeton, and Cornell represented the Ancient Eight.
Given the parity of the league this year, home-field advantage may prove crucial for Harvard as it attempts to capture the conference tournament for the first time in the event’s five-year history.
The Crimson earned the right to host by sharing the regular season league title with Cornell and beating the Bid Red head-to-head, 14-9, in Ithaca earlier this season.
Harvard has been unstoppable at home this season, going 6-0 with an average margin of victory of more than five goals.
But the quality of the teams it hosted does not match the quality of the teams it played on the road. The Crimson’s home opponents have a combined record of 27-52 this season, while its away opponents have a cumulative record of 67-38.
Despite the team’s sub-.500 record on the road this season, Harvard beat both Cornell and Yale and led Penn by two goals late in the fourth quarter before eventually falling in overtime, all away.
At home, the team will look to perform even better in these potential rematches.
“We only have the Yale game and that’s it,” Wojcik said. “We’re just focused on Yale, but it is nice to be playing on our home field.”
The tournament promises to be a shootout, as all four teams rank in the top 25 in scoring offense with more than ten goals per game. Harvard will likely lean heavily on its catalyst, sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer, who recently garnered Ivy League Player of the Week honors.
Dwyer primarily looks to create opportunities for his teammates with feeds from behind the goal, and he leads the Crimson with 30 assists on the season despite missing the team’s first four games due to injury.
Co-captain midfielder Peter Schwartz, as well as sophomore attackman Will Walker, will likely be counted on to lead the goal-scoring efforts for Harvard.
The duo leads the team with 21 and 32 goals, respectively.
The Crimson appears to be peaking at the right time, as it has won four of its last five games while climbing the national rankings and capturing a share of the Ancient Eight title.
If Harvard were to win the Ivy League Tournament, it would guarantee its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2006.
“It was great to win an Ivy League championship and we’re all very proud of that,” co-captain defenseman Joe Petrucci said. “But we’re not satisfied. We have much, much larger goals this season and we think our best lacrosse is still out there. So I think the mindset is just laser-like focus on Yale this Friday night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rainy weather postponed Senior Day for the Harvard baseball team until Tuesday afternoon, when Dartmouth visited O’Donnell Field for an end-of-season doubleheader. The unseasonably cold and windy conditions remained, and the Crimson found itself on the losing end of the final two games of its season.
The squads battled for five scoreless innings in the day’s first game, but the wheels came off for Harvard in the sixth as Dartmouth rode to a 9-0 win. In the rubber match, the Big Green also prevailed, 5-3, in a back-and-forth contest.
“Going into the day, we knew we were out of it,” junior co-captain Ethan Ferreira said. “But we were just trying to play for our seniors over a very close team…. Unfortunately, we lost these two games. We wanted to win these two games for them and end on a good note.”
DARTMOUTH 5, HARVARD 3
In its final game of the season, the Crimson hung around from start to finish but could not overcome what proved to be a decisive four-run fifth inning for the Big Green.
With junior Matt Timoney on the hill for Harvard, Dartmouth struck first in the top of the second with an unearned run after a walk, a single, and an error in the Crimson infield.
Harvard responded to tie the game in the top of the third, as junior shortstop Jake McGuiggan smoked a 2-0 pitch over the left field fence. The solo shot was McGuiggan’s first homer of the season and the team’s second.
The Crimson would take its first lead of the day in very next inning, and McGuiggan again did the damage. After junior outfielder Jack Colton singled and advanced to second, McGuiggan slapped a two-strike pitch up the middle to give his team a 2-1 lead. McGuiggan went 3-for-4 on the day, a triple short of the cycle.
But as soon as Harvard pulled ahead, Dartmouth countered in commanding fashion with a four-run fifth. With runners on first and third, two consecutive RBI singles allowed the Big Green to reclaim the lead. Joe Purritano, last year’s Ivy Rookie of the year, then roped a double to right-center that plated two more.
Harvard scratched across another run in the eighth, but it would be too little, too late as Dartmouth held on to secure the series sweep.
Crimson coach Bill Decker ensured playing time for a number of seniors in their last career game, in addition to regulars Carlton Bailey, co-captain Kyle Larrow, and Steve Dill. Bailey led the Crimson with a .306 batting average this season.
DARTMOUTH 9, HARVARD 0
If any fans left their seats for the top of the sixth and returned an inning later in the day’s first contest, they may have wondered if they were watching the same game.
After five innings of play, the Crimson and Big Green were locked in a scoreless battle. But the Dartmouth bats came roaring to life in the sixth, erupting for nine runs. In a matter of minutes, a game up for grabs had turned into a rout.
Indeed, the offensive surge seemed to come out of nowhere. Freshman pitcher Nick Gruener had allowed just two hits in five innings of work, and not a single Big Green batter had reached second base.
But everything went south for Harvard in the top of the sixth. After a walk, a hit batsman, and a single loaded the bases for Dartmouth, Gruener surrendered a single to Thomas Roulis that plated the first two runs of the game.
Three more runs eventually scored on a fielder’s choice, an error, and a walk. After Gruener hit a batter to load the bases, Decker replaced his starter with senior Joey Novak. But Dartmouth’s Jeff Keller promptly dealt the biggest blow of the inning, smacking an offering over the left field fence for a grand slam.
“Besides a couple of tough innings, I thought our staff pitched really well,” Larrow said. “We could have used a couple more timely hits. It was a tough day, all in all, to come out and string together 16 innings given the conditions.”
Despite the lopsided final score, Harvard actually out-hit the Big Green, 7-6. The difference was that the Crimson failed to come through with runners in scoring position.
The biggest opportunity for Harvard came in the third, when three consecutive hits from Bailey, Larrow, and junior outfielder Mike Martin loaded the bases with one out. But a strikeout and a groundout left the runners stranded on the basepaths.
Martin highlighted Harvard’s offensive output in the first game, going three-for-four. Although an ugly sixth inning ultimately spoiled Gruener’s final start of the season, the freshman struck out six batters and contributed a dominant first five innings.
“I’m proud of these guys the way we’ve battled all year long,” Larrow said. “It stinks to come up short again, but there are a lot of good things to build on. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to be a part of it, but it was an honor to be on this team for four years.”

 Earlier yesterday, students checked their inboxes on Firefox, Chrome or Safari to find an email warning them to "Temporarily Discontinue Use of Internet Explorer," but really just reminding them that the browser didn't actually die in the early 2000s.
 Apart from being so slow that you can’t even play 2048 properly, Internet Explorer also has a security flaw that could allow hackers to take over your computer and look at your emails (wait, doesn’t that sound familiar?).
So for those of you still living in 2005, you might want to avoid using Internet Explorer for a while (or forever) while the problem is fixed. And honestly, if Internet Explorer was your browser up until yesterday, you had problems already.
There are two very well-known facts about highly-selective admissions among Asian American applicants:
1. Asian American applicants and admittances, on average, score higher on the SAT than students from any other race.
2. While the percentage of students belonging to most other racial minorities in highly selective colleges have gone up over the years, the percentage of Asian-American students has not.
Taken together, these facts have spurred worry among many potential Asian American applicants and their families that selective college admission is biased against students of Asian descent—that an already very competitive pool is made even more competitive because of their race alone. This fear has been fueled by findings from the Department of Education’s investigation into allegations that Harvard and Princeton discriminated against Asian American applicants in 2012, as well as the recent national debate over affirmative action.
However, according to Jason Lewis, an admissions expert working for InGenius Prep with several years of admissions experience at Columbia and Washington University, all applications in his experience are reviewed on an individual basis.
“There is no difference in the way applications are reviewed with respect to Asian Americans or any other race. “ Lewis said. “Although we’re aware of a student’s race when they choose to disclose it, there’s no difference in the review process.”
Jean Webb, former Director of Admissions at Yale Law School, agreed that each application is individually reviewed.
“Admissions officers would understand what the general scope of statistics are for all the different groups, but they would not look at an applicant in comparison with only other students within that group,” Webb said.
When asked whether they believed admissions at elite colleges were biased against Asian Americans, Harvard student Theresa C. Rizk ’17 said that she believes Asian-American applicants likely have lower chances because of both the higher quantity and quality of applicants within the racial group. She added, however, that this may not stem from a desire to discriminate, but rather, out of the need for diversity.
Webb said that diversity is important for any university.
“One of the things studies have shown is that diversity is good. That it benefits all institutions and it benefits the learning environment,” she said.
Webb added that the meaning of “diversity” differs from college to college, giving an example of a school in California and a school in the Midwest facing different applicant pools and having different needs with regards to “diversity.”
For Ash Asencios ’17, on the other hand, the issue was the assumption that Asian Americans are currently well-represented at elite universities. Ascencios said that identities like South Asian or Southeast Asian identities might be further deterred from elite admissions because they’re grouped into a “greater Asian identity.”
Ultimately, Lewis advised anxious students—both Asian Americans and not—to continue to be authentic.
According to Lewis, because of the competitive nature of admission to elite colleges like the Ivy League, the reality is that students may be doing all they can but still have a very slim chance of acceptance. This often leaves students, regardless of their race, demoralized.
“The best advice any admission officer can give you is do what you love. Follow your passions,” Lewis said. “As early as a student can identify what it is that makes them happy…the better they are going to be positioned to get into a top college.”
