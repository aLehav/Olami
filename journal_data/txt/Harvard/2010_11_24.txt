After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Where do we start?” Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) asks Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) near the beginning of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One,” the penultimate installment of the series. Unsure how he, Harry, and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) will find and destroy Lord Voldemort’s four remaining horcruxes, Ron poses the question that will serve as an impetus for the film’s plot. One can certainly imagine director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves asking each other the same question as they faced their own insurmountable task: adapting J.K. Rowling’s final novel in Harry Potter’s saga into a coherent movie.
Most notably, Yates and Kloves split “Deathly Hallows” in two. This decision was fairly unavoidable, given the length of the novel and the significance of most of its scenes. The presentation of the first half of the book leaves “Deathly Hallows Part One” feeling slightly unsatisfying, as nothing is actually resolved. However, Kloves—and in particular Yates—have done an admirable job of turning a lengthy, fast-paced book into a stimulating cinematic experience.
The script of “Part One” adheres closely to its source text. Much of the film, such as the scene in which Mad-Eye Moody is pronounced dead, is taken almost verbatim from the book. As pleased as many fans will be with this, the move is not necessarily a recipe for automatic success—the first two Potter movies did not stray far from Rowling’s books, yet their poor acting and minimal direction made them the worst among the films. “Deathly Hallows” is a particularly difficult book to adapt, since it is so different from its predecessors. There is no Hogwarts, no Quidditch, and little magical diversion to entertain the audience. Guest actors, who have often carried the Potter movies, are mostly absent, and those that do appear here (Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour and Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood) contribute nothing remarkable with their characters. What we do have is Harry, Ron, and Hermione trekking across the British countryside in an increasingly dark and dismal hunt for the horcruxes that possess Lord Voldemort’s immortality.
Left to carry the brunt of the acting, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson continue to demonstrate what has been evident from the last two Potter movies: they have truly grown into their roles. Radcliffe is particularly rewarding to watch, delivering his most mature performance yet as his character attempts to lead his friends on a seemingly impossible journey. His chemistry with Watson (which culminates in by far the most surprising scene in the whole series) is notable for its believability, actually eclipsing what Grint manages in his scenes with his character’s future wife.
As effective as the three actors are, it is Yates’s brilliant vision that carries the movie. Yates takes Harry, Ron, and Hermione to just about every corner of Great Britain, situating their tent in some of the most bizarre but beautiful spots imaginable. Throughout the journey, the cinematography is innovative and noteworthy. When the trio’s camp is approached by a group of hostile “snatchers,” the camera rotates around Hermione and one of the outsiders, successfully emphasizing the precariousness of the group’s position, as well as their isolation.
Yates likewise takes full advantage of the many avenues for cinematic exploration in Rowling’s book. The gothic animation of “The Tale of the Three Brothers” is one of the movie’s highlights, successfully adapting the children’s tale into a haunting but gripping addendum to the live action of the film. The two scenes with Polyjuice Potion—Harry’s escape from Privet Drive and the break-in at the Ministry of Magic—are extremely funny. Radcliffe superbly acts as seven copies of himself, conveying the other characters’ personalities perfectly, from Fleur Delacour’s neediness to Mundungus Fletcher’s skullduggery. At the Ministry, David O’Hara adds a delightfully comical slow walk and general uncertainty to Harry masquerading as the Death Eater-sympathizer Albert Runcorn. Yates controls both action-packed and sedate scenes with an assured hand, ensuring the movie proceeds at a steady but unrelenting pace.
For all the success of this adaptation, however, it remains the case that a perfect movie adaptation of the Harry Potter books is probably impossible. Just like all of the Harry Potter films, “Deathly Hallows Part One” will be incomprehensible to anyone who has not read the books. Kloves makes some effort to explain details that previous movies missed (such as how Bill Weasley was attacked, or what the Trace is). However, many points—like the significance of the mirror Harry keeps looking at or how the heroes suddenly learn to apparate—simply go unmentioned. Such significant omissions mean that the movie series will never be able to stand alone—it can only ever be an enjoyable accompaniment to the books.
It is hard to criticize Kloves for his cuts, however, since it is simply impossible to retain everything important from Rowling’s book. Despite the considerable loyalty he showed to the text, significant omissions are unavoidable. One notable storyline that is played down is Harry’s doubts about Dumbledore’s intentions. Dumbledore’s family scandal and adolescence is hinted at, but its significance for Harry’s quest remains unexplored. Hopefully “Deathly Hallows Part Two” will delve into Harry’s suspicion of Dumbledore’s motives and the angst that such worry causes him—the resolution of which proved one of the richest and most rewarding additions Rowling made to the final book.
In this as in other issues, it is hard to judge “Deathly Hallows Part One” before “Part Two” is released in July. But “Part One” seems to be a very satisfactory step towards a successful conclusion of the series. Yates’s steady hand guides the series onwards, with the continuing improvement of the movies now an undeniable fact. The Harry Potter movies will never be perfect, and they will never live up to the books. But for now, we can certainly make do with an impressive penultimate installment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 announced last week that the College is in the process of re-evaluating its decision to eliminate early admissions. The program, known as Early Action, allowed applicants to receive a non-binding admissions notification in the winter. The college removed this option four years ago because top officials felt it gave an unfair edge to candidates from more affluent backgrounds. Such a groundbreaking decision deserves the critical reconsideration Harvard is currently undergoing, but administrators must stay true to their commitment to socioeconomic diversity. If such an evaluation reveals that a return to Early Action would compromise this priority, the program must not be reinstated.
This news comes on the heels of the University of Virginia’s announcement that it will reinstate early admissions; UVA had followed Harvard’s lead in eliminating its Early Decision option in 2006 and now exemplifies a growing trend of restoring related programs in competitive universities across the country. Whatever Harvard decides to do at the end of its evaluation, such actions should not be influenced by other schools’ choices. We hope that the admissions office acts solely according to what best serves Harvard and its goals.
With that established, it is important to note that although admissions officials have acknowledged the improved socioeconomic diversity in recent applicant pools, the admissions office should seek other ways to achieve this goal as well. Beyond the Early Action issue, Harvard can employ additional methods that can be useful in expanding the group of candidates to underrepresented populations.
For instance, financial aid officials should increase awareness about the generous financial assistance provided to accepted students. Harvard’s financial aid initiative is one of the most generous in the country, so publicizing it to students wary of the College’s high tuition costs can greatly improve the socioeconomic diversity of our applicants by encouraging less well-off students to apply. No interested student should receive the impression that Harvard’s price tag makes applying untenable, so the onus is on the school to ensure that all potential applicants are knowledgeable of our financial aid packages.
To this end, we urge greater cooperation between school officials and the Undergraduate Admissions Council, a student group dedicated to, among other things, reconnecting current Harvard students to their high schools through outreach efforts. The UAC runs the Return to High School program, which trains undergraduates to visit their high school classrooms and answer questions potential applicants have about Harvard. These educational efforts allow Harvard to engage with those in more unconventional locations and thus increase the variety of our applicants. Moving forward, we hope that regardless of their decision on Early Action, admissions officials will incorporate these ideas in their pursuit of greater socioeconomic diversity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Drew G. Faust declared that if and when the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy is repealed, she will reinstate the Reserve Officer Training Corps on Harvard’s campus. President Faust certainly has political sway, and I applaud her efforts to press for the rapid repeal of DADT. However, blindly supporting ROTC is not a correct or just way to do that.
Harvard abolished its own ROTC program in 1969 in response to the protests of the anti-war group Students for a Democratic Society. The University now justifies its continued ban with its opposition to the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which violates Harvard’s antidiscrimination laws. In fact, President Faust’s recent declaration implies that DADT is the only thing keeping ROTC away from Harvard.
I greatly respect those who want to join the military after college, and I certainly believe that the University should continue recognizing ROTC scholarships. However, the repeal of DADT should not entail an immediate reinstitution of ROTC on Harvard’s campus.
It is true that Harvard has a long and illustrious history of producing successful military leaders and has produced more Congressional Medal of Honor winners than any college outside the service academies. But the University is a private institution with no affiliation to the U.S. government and thus has no obligation to recruit for ROTC. And as a staff editorial in The Harvard Crimson from 20 years ago noted, “this University should be in the business of education and not military training.”
Discrimination against homosexuals aside, the U.S. military is far from blameless. The great majority of men and women in the military are courageous and honorable, and the military engages in many just and humanitarian causes around the globe. However, the U.S. Department of Defense has faced allegations of abuse ranging from torturing prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to training Latin American soldiers in anti-humanitarian tactics and principles at the School of the Americas. The Iraq War alone has seen torture at Abu Ghraib, the Haditha massacre, and the horrifying shootings by Blackwater military contractors in Baghdad, as well as approximately 100,000 civilian deaths. Wikileaks recently exposed that within the last decade, the U.S. armed forces have engaged in countless non-humanitarian and debatably illegal practices in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. has provided military aid in support of Israel’s aggressive actions against Palestinian civilians. These are not actions that Harvard University should condone, let alone support.
Also, apart from its ongoing history of discrimination based on sexual orientation, the military maintains a well-established policy of gender discrimination. Although many strong women serve in the armed forces, the military does not draft women or place them in active combat roles, perpetuating a stereotype of female weakness and subordination. Harvard excusing discrimination against women but not against homosexuals sends the message that restricting women in the service is completely acceptable.
Fortunately or unfortunately, Harvard’s actions reverberate across American media and discussion about university policy. Furthermore, our graduates become public officials, business leaders, policy makers, and influential academics. Thus, Harvard has a duty to act in a socially responsible and just manner and must carefully consider the effects of policy changes such as the reinstatement of ROTC. As such, we should avoid setting a national precedent of blind support for the U.S. military.
Supporters of ROTC note that if Harvard students object to the practices of the military, then they can join ROTC and work within the system to amend flawed policies. However, not only is it unlikely that a few officers could cause significant change to the U.S. armed forces, but it is also offensive and unfair to expect people to join and thereby support an institution that fundamentally contradicts their principles.
President Faust added in a speech that she hopes “the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ would smooth over lingering opposition to the military’s presence on campus.” Unfortunately, she incorrectly presumes that DADT is the only viable objection to the U.S. armed forces.
While I have the utmost respect for the women and men who serve our country every day, promising to reinstate ROTC simply to pressure a repeal of DADT is not only short-sighted but also contradicts President Faust’s vision of an open and just university. As long as the armed forces continue to act in a manner inconsistent with basic humanitarian principles, ROTC does not belong on Harvard’s campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems hard to argue for felons’ rights. They’re the one group that is politically untouchable. Not only do candidates shun them to avoid being seen as “soft on crime,” but practically speaking, it would be a waste of time to pay any attention to those who can’t vote. The inmate is the bogeyman of American politics; because felons are feared and reviled, their lack of voting rights goes unmentioned in popular political discourse. However, the nonvoting status of felons is an affront to their rights as citizens, and because of the specific demographics of the incarcerated population, it is also a civil-rights issue; it should be eliminated immediately.
Perhaps it makes sense to first ask: Why do we strip the felon of her vote? According to some, this revocation of a citizen’s most fundamental right is a logical part of what a criminal must relinquish for having broken the social contract. Others claim it is to prevent people with such a clear lack of judgment from influencing the way the country is run.
These claims would perhaps make sense if we were not currently jailing an excessive portion of the population. The truth is, with 2.3 million people behind bars, we in the United States may be nearing the point where a major reevaluation of civil rights in our justice system becomes necessary. The number of people that voted in the 2008 presidential election was 132.6 million, approximately 57 percent of eligible voters. Therefore, depending in which state the felon vote was distributed, even half of prisoners voting could have made a small to significant difference. If it comes to the point that the “felon vote” is actually electorally consequential, we should seriously question why so many people are being locked up in the first place; we should not be incarcerating enough people to impact an election. Notwithstanding this reality, as we work out larger problems with the way we punish people, we should allow this not-inconsequential bloc of voters to have a substantive say in elections.
After all, elections function as a national conversation on, among many things, the criminal justice system. Therefore, the right to vote influences the existence or disappearance of all the other rights. The loss of physical freedom, which is at the heart of incarceration, is not as consequential as disenfranchisement. If you are incarcerated but retain the vote, you have value to the political system and cannot be completely ignored. However, if you are incarcerated without the right to vote, you, and everyone else in your position, is suddenly invisible.
Further complicating the issue of disenfranchising felons is that black Americans are severely overrepresented in prison. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that blacks make up 13.5 percent of the total U.S. population, but as reported by a July 2006 Kaiser Family Foundation report, African-American men make up 40 percent of the prison population. Data released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2007 revealed that there are more than three times as many black people living in prison than in college. Therefore, giving prisoners the right to vote is also a civil-rights issue. Denying this privilege disenfranchises an already-underrepresented minority group from influencing an election and compounds historical injustices.
We must enfranchise all Americans, regardless of previous criminal convictions, so that our government is responsible for the system of justice it maintains. This is an even more important issue now, as it is uncertain if our criminal justice system is trustworthy and fair enough that everyone in prison actually deserves to be there. We must enfranchise the convict, not because disenfranchisement is too harsh, but because it is the only way to forestall serious abuses in the way we punish people in America.

Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much of anything today. As cited by Bill Bishop in The Big Sort, from 1976 to 2008, the share of voters living in counties where one party won the presidential election by 20 points or more has increased from 26 percent to 48 percent. Keith Poole of the University of California, San Diego Department of Political Science has predicted that the 112th Congress will be the most divided version of the body that has existed since the end of the Civil War.
On one thing, however, nearly every politician in a competitive seat can agree: Elitism is to be avoided at all costs. While this aversion to the leadership of those who are perceived as distinct from the common man has been a political force since the Jackson era, it has intensified recently in conjunction with the Tea Party movement (an ironic development, considering that the modern Tea Party was inspired by the longtime Texan congressman Ron Paul, and its 18th century namesake was originally led by the distinguished “elite” Samuel Adams, Class of 1740).
From whence comes this antipathy toward “elitists”? Furthermore, why is the word “elite” so often used in a positive sense, while “elitism” and “elitists” are almost exclusively negative labels? The first page of a Google search for “elite” turns up nine positive uses, mostly brand names, and one neutral one (a dictionary entry). On the other hand, a similar search for “elitism” is far more mixed, with four decidedly negative results, five neutral dictionary or encyclopedia results, and one World of Warcraft guild.
Since elite status is so sought after in the substance of one’s material possessions, it seem strange that it should be anathema in the substance of politics. Most people expect their cars, computers, and clothing to be crafted by trained professionals and would laugh at the suggestion that they should be responsible for making these things themselves. Governing, however, is apparently an entirely different matter, as it would come as a shock to most political spectators if a presidential candidate were to loudly advertise an advanced degree in public policy or political science as a key component of their platform.
One potential explanation for this is that policymaking seems many times more accessible to a layperson than does electrical or mechanical engineering, so that someone with no formal training in either of these subjects would feel significantly more comfortable if tasked with designing a new tax system than with improving the performance of a graphics card. Nevertheless, this is a wrong intuition. While it is true that normative judgment plays a much larger role in the former than the latter, there is still a high degree of established science involved in predicting outcomes in both of these endeavors that requires some technical expertise.
The lessons that we can take away from this understanding give cause for some optimism and some pessimism, but above all, cynicism. If a politician were to explicitly state that voters should back him because of his “elite” status—the degree to which his understanding of the issues at hand far supersedes theirs, he would be perceived as arrogant and would likely lose support. Moreover, we can’t erase the barrier between elites and non-elites; an attempt to bring the majority of voters to a level of understanding comparable to that of top macroeconomists would fail to inspire and likely be met predominantly with apathy.
On a slightly more positive note, the perception of competence on economic or foreign policy issues does often translate into increased popularity. The downside is that this perception depends heavily on the watered-down versions of the truth that reach the general public with the highest frequency, resulting in an incomplete understanding of what really entails competence.
It is thus unlikely that aversion to elitism will go away any time soon. In the meantime, everyone (especially “elites”) should take time to remember the words of H.L. Mencken: “There is always a well-known solution to every human problem—neat, plausible, and wrong.” Take every effort to not make the mistake of being overly critical of elitism and of overestimating your own understanding of any particular situation, at the expense of missing the more complicated truth.

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have discovered a relationship between depression and type 2 diabetes, two serious conditions in the United States.
After following nearly 55,000 nurses over ten years and documenting their conditions of depression and diabetes through questionnaires, the researchers observed a possible biological and behavioral linkage between the conditions.
The study found a 17 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes among the 7,400 nurses that had depression symptoms, and a 29 percent greater risk of developing depression among the 2,800 nurses that developed diabetes.
“It is one of the first studies to indicate the bidirectional relationship, also the largest one and longest duration of time,” said Frank B. Hu, senior author of the study and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Hu said he believes that one of the important factors contributing to the biological and behavioral linkages between depression and diabetes is stress.
In terms of the biological connection, people with depression symptoms often have chronic stress, and certain stress hormones such as cortisol—a hormone released by the adrenal gland upon increased stress levels—may lead to abnormal glucose metabolism, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, according to Hu.
Behaviorally, long-term stress may result in diminished quality of life through overeating and an unhealthy diet, thus increasing risks for both diabetes and depression, Hu said.
The chronic nature of diabetes may also increase stress level, as it often requires daily monitoring and management of high blood sugar.
Hu said he hopes that the results of this study will help improve current clinical treatments of diabetes and depression.
“For people who have clinical depression, I think clinicians should pay attention to blood sugar and potential risks for diabetes,” Hu said. “On the other hand, for people who have diabetes, I think we should pay attention to their mental health and the psycho-social aspect of their diabetes management.”
“[Depression and diabetes] may become a vicious cycle if you don’t pay attention to the bidirectional relationship,” he added.
The study was published in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine earlier this week.
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTIONS: November 29, 2010
An earlier version of the  Nov. 24 news article "Study: Link Between Depression and Diabetes"  incorrectly stated that cortisol is released by the brain. In fact, it  is released by the adrenal gland.
The article also misquoted Frank B. Hu, senior author of the study.

With the concentrations for the class of 2013 officially declared and tallied, the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has seen a 12-percent bump in its total concentrators, continuing a three-year growth trend.
According to data compiled from Harvard College Facebook, 176 sophomores are studying applied mathematics, engineering, or computer science, bringing the total number of undergraduates concentrating in these fields to 465—the highest since at least 2001.
The growth this year was partially driven by a spike in student interest in computer science. Fifty-two sophomores declared concentrations in CS this year, double the number of juniors pursuing a major in the field.
Computer Science professor and former College Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68 attributed the new interest in CS primarily to the strength of Computer Science 50, the introductory coding class which drew a record number of students this year.
“CS50 has really been successful in showing people what exciting, fantastic things people can do with just a semester’s experience,” he said.
Lewis also pointed to several other potential causes for the uptick in interest, including the growing profile of SEAS as a first-rate engineering school and the recent popularity of the film ‘The Social Network,’ which gives a fictionalized account of how former Harvard CS concentrator Mark E. Zuckerberg founded Facebook.
“Everybody in America knows we do computer science because they’ve seen it on the big screen,” Lewis said. “I’m not sure that if Harvard students saw ‘The Social Network’ they would rush to major in CS, but I don’t know.”
The introduction of a new undergraduate concentration in biomedical engineering appears to have had a lesser impact on SEAS’ growth.
While the new concentration did attract 12 sophomores, SEAS Assistant Dean for Academic Programs Marie Dahleh noted that this corresponded with a drop of ten concentrators from last year in the broader engineering sciences major.
Dahleh said she therefore believed that many of the new biomedical engineering concentrators are students who would still have concentrated in engineering even if the new concentration were not an option.
“My expectation is that the concentration is new, and it will grow,” Dahleh said. She added that SEAS is currently selecting individuals to serve as permanent concentration advisers and the director of undergraduate studies for biomedical engineering, with the hope that they will be able to promote the concentration more heavily next year.
“We’re hoping that will give us more visibility among the life sciences concentrations so that students will be able to make the choice that is right for them,” Dahleh said.

“Baby kimonos”—garments for infants with buttons down the side—had the place of honor last night in the Pforzheimer dining hall during a charitable clothes decorating event held by House Fellow Aviva Presser Aiden.
According to Aiden, the painted and stenciled kimonos will be sent to the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, where she hopes they will be distributed to underprivileged babies.
Aiden said she had the idea to hold the event when the house committee gave her 5-month-old son Gabriel a bodysuit with the caption “Pfoho’s favorite baby.”
She said she chose baby kimonos because they are easy to put on and often distributed to families in need in places such as hospitals.
A representative of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital has agreed to receive the kimonos, according to Aiden, but she said she is concerned that the hospital might ultimately end up refusing them because they are not in their original sanitary package.
“They want to make sure they’re not endangering the kids at all,” she said.
If the hospital refuses to take the kimonos, Aiden will send them to Room to Grow, a non-profit which supports families of young children living in poverty in New York City and Boston.
Pforzheimer House Allston Burr Resident Dean Lisa Boes took part in the event, decorating the bottom of one kimono with a few ivy leaves and a small crimson H.
“You know sometimes, less is more,” she said jokingly.
But Boes was nearly alone at the event; although Aiden advertised it over the Pforzheimer e-mail list, very few students ended up taking part in the event.
“It would have been nice if a few more people had shown up,” Aiden said, adding that many students had probably already left for Thanksgiving Break at the time of the event last night.
Aiden said that she would be holding a similar event hopefully before the end of the semester and that she hoped Pforzheimer students would then help her to decorate the remaining kimonos.
This is not the first time that Aiden has worked to help children from underprivileged families. In 2005, she and her husband founded Bears Without Borders, a charity that sends stuffed toys to children in developing countries.
“[Both charity initiatives] definitely come from the same personal place,” Aiden said.

A recent Dutch study found that the radiation emitted by wireless routers and access points has a detrimental effect on trees in the vicinity, but Harvard officials said that the University has not noticed any effects on campus flora.
A study conducted at Wageningen University in Netherlands found that 70 percent of trees in urban areas exhibited odd markings and signs of cell death on their leaves, compared to just 10 percent five years ago. The researchers believed that these findings signaled a correlation between wifi radiation and cell death in trees.
According to Dutchnews.nl, the Wageningen University researchers placed 20 ash trees in contact with emissions from six wifi access points over a three-month period and found that the leaves nearest the source fell off.
The study may initially seem relevant to Harvard: many areas at Harvard such as the Yard and Quad nestle large swaths of plants and trees, and wireless internet is an integral part of the University’s infrastructure.
But the findings of the Dutch study are not necessarily conclusive, according to Harvard Physics Professor Richard Wilson.
“It seems that the study merely found an increase in problems and jumped to a conclusion that it [tree leaf death] is related to wifi,” Wilson wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson. “This is enough for asking a question but not enough to raise an alarm.”
Harvard’s Facilities Maintenance Operations office echoed that skepticism: “We haven’t notice any negative impact caused by the wifi routers,” Associate Director of Landscape and Business Support Wayne P. Carbone wrote in an e-mail.
The current report does not give enough detail to merit a change in University policy, according to FAS IT spokesperson Noah Selsby.
“According to the article provided by The Crimson to FAS IT, the institution at which this research was conducted is expressing their doubts about the findings by distancing themselves from the report,” Selsby wrote in an e-mail.
Selsby also said that the report lacked concrete detail.

Upwards of 20 students loaded up on cupcakes, mashed potatoes, brownies decked in fall-colored sprinkles, and a pie with “QSA” written in its crust for last night’s Queer Thanksgiving potluck and discussion about how to address LGBT dinner topics over the holidays.
The potluck, which was co-sponsored by QSA, GLOW, CONTACT, and GirlSpot, has been held for several years, but this was the first time attendees were invited to participate in more formal discussion in anticipation of addressing topics of sexuality when going home for Thanksgiving and the winter holidays.
“A lot of LGBT students have complex relationships with their families and it’s important to provide a space where they have a sense of family and community during a time that forces us to think about those relationships,” said QSA Co-chair Marco Chan ’11.
The attendees included students in various stages of coming out to their families. Some had been out and greeted with acceptance, others had faced opposition in their coming out process, and one first-year asked for advice concerning her plan to come out to her family over Thanksgiving.
S. Rue Wilson, associate chief of Harvard Mental Health Services, facilitated the discussion and shared personal stories and words of guidance with attendees.
“The beginning of college is a funky period of adjusting back and forth between being here and other places, and not everyone’s willing to let you be yourself when you go home,” she said.
She added that it is important for LGBT students to allow time for their parents to come to terms with discussions of their child’s identity.
“Sexuality is an important part of who you are, but it doesn’t have to be front and center every moment,” she said.
Wilson emphasized the usefulness of a supportive community, especially considering tensions that may exist between LGBT students and their parents, extended families, and religious or cultural upbringing.
QSA Co-chair Emma Q. Wang ’12, who is also a student member of the BGLTQ Working Group evaluating LGBT resources at Harvard, said that Queer Thanksgiving could benefit from more centralized resources.
“This event happened only because some students thought it would be important to highlight these issues in a safe space,” she said, adding that a staff person with background and experience on these issues could help people grapple with difficult dinner topics. “It indicates how resources don’t only mean material goods but also intangible support, dedicated effort and time.”
Attendee Sarina M. Patterson ’14 agreed that dedicated staff would be helpful in guiding students through difficult discussions about sexuality.
“I feel really welcomed here, not necessarily by any policy Harvard has specifically done, but by all the people, and I feel like this Thanksgiving event really strengthens those bonds,” she said. “You can’t choose your family, but you can choose your friends, and I feel like the people here are becoming a kind of family for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seated at a round table in Leverett Private Dining Room, Fabio L. Carneiro, the deputy head of supervision department at the Central Bank of Brazil, led a dinner discussion with students about international economics in Brazil.
Carneiro spoke about Brazil’s rising influence in global markets and finance through the lens of an economist working as a Brazilian citizen and as a banking supervisor for the past 15 years.
“Brazil is a regional power in South America and has a foreign policy that is designed to give importance to South-South trade. It’s now trying to implement a diversification policy in its trade,” Carneiro said. “The U.S. is losing importance as a commercial partner, while China, India, and South American countries are gaining power.”
Carneiro is at Harvard as a Weatherhead Center for International Affairs Fellow, where he is working on a research project about the impact of changes in financial prudential regulations on the stability versus efficiency trade-off in Brazil, Russia, India, and China—known as the BRIC countries.
He added that he also meets regularly with other fellows and is auditing a Harvard class on economic growth.
The Harvard International Relations on Campus, which acts as the liaison between the Weatherhead Center and Harvard undergraduates, organizes dinner talks by fellows throughout the year.
Roland Yang ’14, a member of IRoC’s dinner discussion committee, chose Carneiro as the speaker because of his interest in economics.
“Right now Brazil has a new president and one of their concerns is economic growth,” Yang said. “[Carneiro] is well placed to provide firsthand experience about the situation.”
Several recent events organized by IRoC have focused on developing countries in Latin America and the BRIC countries. A two-part study group was held on state failure in Latin America and concluded with a discussion on Brazilian state issues last Monday.
“IRoC exists on behalf of undergraduates, so we try to organize events that attract their interests. We have seen that Harvard students are interested in developing countries,” said Jonathan M. Kaufman ’12, IRoC co-president.
The discussion was followed by questions from students. Victoria Baena ’14, an IRoC member, said she appreciated the opportunity for informal discussion. Baena is traveling to Brazil over J-Term to explore the country’s culture.
“Students are looking at who’s going to be the future economic giants because those are the countries we’re going to be working with,” Baena said.

It is not entirely uncommon to hear a story of alumni giving back to Harvard financially as a way to show their gratitude for the opportunities and life changing experiences they were able to have as students. But what is uncommon is the one-in-a-kind gift that Harvard men’s swimming and diving alumnus Francis X. Gorman ’59 bestowed onto his old team. By doing so, Gorman gave back to Harvard in one of the most unique ways in recent memory.
On Nov. 19, during a reception that marked the 80th anniversary of the men’s swimming and diving team, Gorman stunned alumni and current students alike by announcing that he was donating his Olympic silver medal to Harvard.
Gorman’s climb to the podium at the 1964 Tokyo Games for the three-meter springboard diving event was only the culmination of an illustrious athletic career. During his time at Harvard, Gorman earned All-American honors in both one- and three-meter boards in addition to securing victories on both boards during the Eastern Intercollegiate Diving Championships of 1959 and 1960.
Gorman’s plan was something that had been in the works for some time. At the time of ceremony, the gift was accepted by men’s swimming and diving coach Keith Miller, who had been in correspondence with Gorman for much of the summer and helped to coordinate Gorman’s plan.
“He called me this summer and said, ‘I had this idea that I’ve been thinking about for a little while and I wanted to see what you thought,’” Miller said. “And when he explained it to me, of course I was elated. As he explained to me, oftentimes [when] people win these medals and awards… they just end up going into drawers and closets or stuffed away. But he thought that his medal was something that we could make use of.”
In the coming weeks, the task that awaits Miller and other members of the swimming and diving team is to secure a proper and safe location where Gorman’s medal can be proudly displayed as a testament to athletic achievement and altruism.
“I’ve never heard of something like this happening before,” Miller said. “Certainly athletes contribute in various ways and help support the team, but I have never heard of an athlete giving an Olympic medal. What Frank hopes is that [his gift] spurs others to do similar things. It is a great thought that brings about more togetherness in the Harvard community.”

Yale linebacker Jesse Reising, who was injured during the fourth quarter of the Harvard-Yale football game on Saturday, is expected to be released from the hospital today, the Yale Daily News reports.
Reising was involved in a helmet-to-helmet collision with Crimson senior running back Gino Gordon in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s contest, a hit that left both men on the ground for several minutes.
Gordon was able to leave the field under his own power, but Reising was taken out of the stadium on a stretcher and has remained at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ever since.
Reising told the YDN that “my nerves aren't firing to my right arm like they're supposed to,” and he may need surgery in three months to reattach them.
The linebacker was awarded the Chester J. LaRoche Award at the Bulldogs’ team banquet over the weekend, which is given to the senior who did the most for Yale through his character, academic talents, and concern for others. He is expected to make a full recovery.

Looking to continue a two-game winning streak, the Harvard men's basketball team will travel to Bryant on Wednesday for a non-conference match-up. Led by sophomore reigning Ivy League Co-Player of the Week Christian Webster, who had a career-high 29 points in the Crimson’s game against Mercer on Saturday, Harvard is 2-1 on the season after dropping its opener to George Mason. 
The Crimson and the Bulldogs have met once before in which Harvard posted a dominant 77-51 victory early on last season. The missing link for the Crimson in this year's rematch is Jeremy Lin ’10, who posted 12 points for the Harvard. Bryant was led by current senior Cecil Gresham, who had 11 points and a game-high eight rebounds. The Bulldogs mustered only a 33.9 shooting percentage and were out-rebounded by Harvard, 42-33.
 Bryant is 1-3, recording its first win of the season over Iona while falling to Cleveland St. in its opening game and Army last weekend. The Bulldogs have a 1-8 record against the Ancient Eight in its time as a Division I team.

As the football team finished its season with its fourth straight victory over Yale, the Back Page gives you an opportunity to meet captain Collin Zych, an unanimous selection to the All-Ivy First Team announced today. In this exclusive interview, Zych reveals his embarrassing fumble return, why he would want to play basketball, and which Olympic gold medalist he would like to date. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Collin Zych 
Year: 2011
Stats: In his three seasons on the field, Zych accumulated 224 total tackles, 10.5 tackles for a loss, six interceptions, and 27 pass breakups. This season, Zych ended the season tied for a team-high 79 tackles. He also led the Crimson with 40 solo tackles, three interceptions and 12 passes defended.
Now, to the questions!
1. Typical pre-game meal.
I just eat what I normally would, nothing too fancy.  No fried food though.
2. Songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
Mostly hip-hop.  Eminem, Lil John, and Jeezy are my artists of choice.
3. Favorite team to play against and why.
Yale. The Game is always an amazing experience, and I have a lot of respect for their players and program.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
I'll have to be careful with this one...The post-game dancing to "Dancing in the Moonlight" can get pretty ridiculous.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the field.
When I was much younger, I picked up a fumble and returned it the wrong way.  I was so young at the time that all of the parents thought it was cute.  Had it happened in high school or here at Harvard, I may have never been able to live it down.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
From my roommate and Harvard QB Collier Winters: "One of those birds that dive bombs into the ocean."  I will assume he is referring to my reckless style of tackling.
7. The most ridiculous thing you've heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
I try to block out the crowd, but I did hear a fan at Penn bring up something from my high school career.  I had to tip my hat because he had done his homework.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
Basketball, no question.  Coach Amaker seems really great, they get the best free gear on campus, and their games have a great atmosphere.  The only bad thing is their extremely long season, which eliminates winter break and spring break.
9. Position you'd play in Quidditch.
Umm, seeker?  That is the only position I can remember off the top of my head.
 
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
Great question.  I would have to go with Nastia Liukin.  She is from Murphy, Texas, which is the town right next to mine.  So at least I have some ounce of a chance of actually getting the date.

After a year in which they intimidated everybody in their path, it was fitting that senior Josue Ortiz and captain Collin Zych were the only two defensive players to be selected unanimously to the All-Ivy First Team. Harvard's leader on the defensive line, Ortiz finished the season as the Ancient Eight's leader in tackles for loss and the runner-up in sacks, with 7.5 and 13.5 respectively. Zych, meanwhile, finished the season with 79 tackles to bring his career total to 224.
Joining the two of them on the first team is senior running back Gino Gordon, who last night received the Frederick Greeley Crocker Award as the team's most valuable player. Gordon was the first Crimson back since Clifton Dawson '07 to rush for over 1000 yards in a season, finishing the 2010 campaign with 1059 yards. He also graduates as Harvard's all-time leader in yards per carry with 5.3.
While the Crimson will certainly miss Gordon's productivity, it won't have to look too far to find his replacement. Sophomore Treavor Scales was named a second-team All-Ivy running back.
Joining Scales on the second team are a trio of his blockers—seniors Chris LeRoy and Brent Osborne, and junior Kevin Murphy. Also earning second-team honors were senior defensive lineman Chuks Obi, senior linebacker Nick Hasselberg, junior linebacker Alex Gedeon, and junior defensive back Matthew Hanson. Tight ends Nicolai Schwarzkopf and Kyle Juszczyk were honorable mentions.

Adjusting to the college lifestyle can be difficult for any freshman. But for Gary Power—an immediate impact player for the Harvard men’s squash team—learning how to handle typical freshman responsibilities must be all the more difficult.
Luckily for the Crimson, Harvard’s current leader at the No. 1 spot seems to have handled the start of his college career flawlessly.
“[Power] has a sparkle in his eye, and he has what we coaches would refer to as an instinctive way of playing,” said Crimson coach Mike Way of the freshman. “Two of our freshmen coming in—he and Brandon [McLaughlin]—have this natural flair for the sport.”
In the first two matches of the season—blowout victories over Brown and Williams—Power put this flair to use, easily defeating both of his older, more experienced opponents in three games. These contests proved to be rather lopsided, as Power beat Bears junior Brad Thompson and Ephs junior William Morris by an aggregate score of 66-31.
“[Power] is a very charismatic young man, and he has a lot of energy,” Way said. “He’s very exciting to watch, and he’s exciting to train with because those are some of the elements he’s bringing to group training.”
For most of his life, Power was a two-sport athlete. Before finding himself in an important role on this year’s Harvard squad, he captained his high school soccer team and garnered first team All-Conference honors.
“I haven’t really had a number one sport,” Power said. “It’s always been [squash and soccer]. I think playing soccer has only helped with fitness. [Playing multiple sports] has definitely helped me keep up the passion for squash over the years, but I’m glad I get to play full-time here.”
Power is part of a strong freshman class that boasts several elite players, including McLaughlin, Nigel Koh, and Thomas Mullaney.
And, with the graduation of Colin West ’10—last year’s CSA Individual National Champion—the Crimson knew early on that it would need to look to its younger players to fill big-time roles and complement the strong core of returners in the 2010-11 season.
So far, the season is taking shape according to plan, as the rookies have held their own on the court for Harvard.
“The attitudes of the freshmen have been absolutely perfect,” Way said. “I think it’s also a tribute to the maturity of the players who are older than them—the sophomores, juniors, and seniors—a tribute to their maturity, especially when you get freshmen coming in who are so strong.”
“Our older players help [the freshmen] navigate their way through Harvard, and not just literally,” Way continued. “[They have helped the freshman learn] how to do the daily training, do their studies, keep on top of things, and really find a balance.”
Power, a two-time Ireland U-19 national squash champion and a former U.S. U-15 national title winner, played for Ireland in the Junior World Championships this summer, leaving him well-prepared for the start of his rookie squash campaign in Cambridge.
“[The team has] been training very hard for the past few months,” said Power of his new Crimson teammates. “We’ve got great team chemistry. The thing I really like about the team this year is that everyone, one through nine, is really close [friendship-wise and in skill level]. We have really good matches every single day, which is just great practice for everyone.”
Though his first few months at Harvard have been successful, Power is setting his sights on winning future matchups and gaining experience.
“The big matches are against Yale, Trinity, Penn, Princeton,” Power said. “Those matches will be a bigger test, because they provide a more intense atmosphere. I haven’t really experienced college squash to the extent that other people have yet, but I’m looking forward to it for sure.”

Heading into its matchup against cross-town rival Boston University, the Harvard women’s basketball team had three goals in mind: to outrebound their opponent, to hold the Terriers below their average points per game, and to neutralize BU’s best forwards.
After 40 minutes of play, the Crimson had achieved its goals, as it rolled to a comfortable 69-58 victory over the Terriers last night in Boston, Mass., at Case Gymnasium.
“We knew it was going to be tough,” senior forward Emma Markley said. “But we had most of the goals that we had taken care of. I think that we did a pretty good job tonight.”
From the opening minutes of play in the first half, it was clear that Harvard would command the rhythm of the game, as the Crimson proved dominant on the offensive and defensive sides of the court.
After five minutes of play, with Harvard leading 12-9, junior guard Brogan Berry added to the Crimson’s lead with a two-point jump shot over the outstretched hands of a BU defender.
Berry’s shot triggered an 8-2 surge by Harvard to grab a nine-point lead at the 9:25 mark of the first half. In the same span of time, the Crimson’s stingy defense kept the Terriers without a single field goal, their only points coming on a pair of free throws.
By the time each team headed for the locker rooms, Harvard maintained its nine-point lead and was up 31-22.
For the Crimson, the first 20 minutes of play had been a productive period. Harvard shot 46 percent from the field while holding BU to just 25 percent. The Crimson also led the Terriers in rebounds, 27-13.
At the start of the second half, Harvard picked up where it left off, hitting five of its first seven shots. But a series of costly turnovers allowed the Terriers to get back into contention. By the 10-minute mark of the second half, BU had cut Harvard’s lead down to three points.
But with a late 6-0 surge, Harvard reasserted its dominance and extended its lead. When time expired from the clock, the Crimson had secured a double-digit victory.
“We weathered their runs,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “Every game has them. The question is do you roll over and die or do you get tough, and I think that we got tough.”
On the game, the Crimson shot 50.9 percent from the field, besting its first half efforts by nearly five percent. Of the starting five, four finished with double-digits in point totals.
Freshman guard Christine Clark stood out in particular with 11 points, five rebounds, and three assists. Clark’s performance, which has been steady since the beginning of the season,  garnered praise from both her teammates and coaches.
“Christine [Clark] has been stepping up almost every game,” Markley said. “She has an incredible ability to take anything to the board. I’m just really happy that I get to play with her for one year. She’s performing really well for a freshman.”
Berry, sophomore guard Victoria Lippert, and Markley chipped in 12, 11, and 10 points, respectively.
But Clark’s breakout performance was not the only accomplishment of the night.
At the end of the contest, Markley discovered from her teammates and coaches that she had scored her 1000th career point in the first half.
“I had no idea that it was coming. It was a great surprise, and I’m pretty happy about it,” the senior said. “I never really expected to score 1000 points in college, so it’s pretty cool.”
This serves as another milestone in what has already been a distinguished career for Markley. Unsurprisingly, Markley’s achievement brought praise and adulation from her team.
“I’m so happy for her,” Delaney-Smith said. “Emma is a fun player to coach and a fun player to watch. You never know what she’s going to do—even though I’m supposed to. But that’s her value. She is not what you would call the traditional player, and that’s what makes her so hard to stop.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Thanksgiving approaches, Harvard undergraduates are coming down from the collective drunken euphoria that is The Game.
Well, that is, pretty much everyone but me. Because while my classmates were tailgating and bidding their proper farewell to Four Loko, I was watching a football game.
My experiences with Harvard-Yale have been less than typical. My only true tailgating experience came freshman year in New Haven, and I spent most of that morning wandering around like a lost puppy trying to find a hamburger.
Sophomore year, I was introduced to the joys of dealing with drunk, grumpy, self-important fans who want to pick up their will-call tickets, as I was an employee of the athletic ticket office (in case you were wondering, there is no joy whatsoever in that task).
And for the last two years, I have limited my pre-noon drinking to a single mimosa and actually (gasp!) watched the entire football game from my perch in the press box.
I hear I’m missing out on some fun by skipping the tailgate early, but what I’ve gotten in return is the chance to watch a couple of pretty great football games.
There was the upset blowout in New Haven freshman year, the shutout that sealed a second straight title in 2008, and last year’s fourth-quarter comeback.
But it was Saturday’s match that I will remember as the quintessential Game—and much of that is because, like the Harvard seniors I’ve become acquainted with through postgame press conferences and stat sheets, it was my last as an undergraduate.
Though I outwardly did my best to stay neutral in the press box, I was inwardly cheering as Marco Iannuzzi broke for the endzone, as Collin Zych raised his arms to pump up the crowd when he walked off the field, as Gino Gordon checked up on the Yale linebacker who had knocked him out, and as Ryan Burkhead celebrated his career-best 2.5-sack performance in his final game.
The class of 2011 has given Crimson fans a series of unforgettable games in their four years in Cambridge, and as the seniors turn their attention to life after college football, let’s take a minute to celebrate their accomplishments.
In the last four years, Harvard has gone 31-9, dropping just four conference games—good for the best record in the Ancient Eight over that time frame. The seniors won two Ivy championships and depart as the only class in Crimson history to have gone undefeated against Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth. The graduating class also boasts a combined 16 All-Ivy nods, including three each for Zych, Gordon, and Chuks Obi. Oh, and it’s got a Rhodes Scholar, too.
But perhaps the class’s biggest legacy is the attitude it has left behind. The seniors had their work cut out for them this year, when an early-season loss to Brown and a rash of injuries to key players could have derailed the 2010 campaign completely.
Instead, the seniors stepped up, both in their individual performances—particularly Gordon and Zych, both first-team All-Ivy selections—and in their leadership, inspiring the team to fight through the adversity and end the season with a 7-3 record, the program’s 10th straight season of at least seven wins.
“You know it’s a big deal for them—their final Yale game in their senior year,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said last week before The Game. “They’ve had such a big impact on our program in terms of specific success, winning Ivy League championships, winning a lot of football games, winning a lot of Yale games. But they’ve had an even bigger effect intangibly.”
“It’s obviously tough to quantify, but they’ve had such a positive effect on the program, a positive effect on recruiting the kids that have been around them,” he added.
The seniors went out on top, taking advantage of their few opportunities—Harvard was outgained by over 100 yards on offense—on its way to beating Yale.
As they celebrated together on the field and as seven of those graduating seniors—plus former classmates Josué Ortiz and Collier Winters, both of whom will return for a fifth year next season—filed into the press conference grinning from ear to ear, it was hard to feel anything but incredibly happy for the class of 2011.
But as I walked away from the stadium for the last time, I couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sadness. After spending every Saturday for the last two falls watching this team play—and becoming intimately familiar with the highways of the Northeast in the process—a chapter of my Harvard life also closed this weekend.
Covering the football team has been one of my favorite parts of Harvard, and a big part of that is because the seniors have made this team a pleasure to watch.
Rising captain Alex Gedeon and his classmates have some big shoes to fill, but if history is any indication, they will rise to the occasion, just as the class of 2011 did this season.
And when I come back next fall to finally get that “real” Harvard-Yale experience, I bet that the rising seniors will make it an event to attend for one reason: the football game.

The Game has ended, and Thanksgiving is here. But even though the fall season is (basically) over, there is still plenty to talk about in Ivy League sports. Three Ancient Eight student-athletes, who put a special emphasis on the “student” half, were honored as Rhodes Scholars; two Ivy men’s soccer teams are making a deep run in the NCAA tournament; Princeton runners impressed at nationals; and football handed out its postseason superlatives. Put down your turkey leg, and join me around the water cooler.
In addition to Harvard’s own Baltazar Zavala, a senior wide receiver on the football team, Dartmouth’s Gabrielle Emanuel and Yale’s William Zeng were chosen as Rhodes Scholars last weekend. Emanuel, who graduated summa cum laude last June, was a rider on the Big Green’s equestrian team and is currently working on a water access and purification program in Mali. Zeng is a member of the Bulldogs’ lightweight crew team and plans to study mathematics and the foundations of computer science at Oxford.
Among the 16 teams left in the NCAA men’s soccer tournament, two of them belong to the Ivy League. After topping Boston College in the first round of the tournament, Brown faced off against UConn last Sunday. The two teams were tied, 1-1, through 120 minutes of action, but the Bears prevailed in penalty kicks, 7-6. On the other side of the bracket, Dartmouth, which had already beaten Monmouth, squared off against Notre Dame. The Big Green and the favored Irish also went into overtime, but a 99th-minute goal from Andrew Olsen sealed the 2-1 win for Dartmouth. Next Sunday Brown faces off against Cal and the Big Green take on UCLA for a chance to play in the quarterfinals.
The cross country season came to a close this past weekend with the men’s and women’s teams from Princeton impressing at the NCAA Championships. The women, who entered the race ranked No. 25 in the nation, took 15th place, and junior Alex Banfich was named an All-American by finishing 20th overall with a time of 20:36. On the men’s side, the Tigers locked up 12th place, the best finish in program history. Two runners also earned All-American status as junior Brian Leung came in 21st (30:19) and classmate Donn Cabral took 34th (30:27).
The Ivy League also announced its All-Ivy teams for football yesterday. League-champion Penn was best represented on the squad, picking up nine first-team honors, and its entire offensive line picked up an all-conference nod. The Quakers had a total of 21 players recognized for their individual achievements on their way to helping Penn earn its second straight undefeated conference record.

Down by four points to a Bryant squad that went 1-29 last season, with 1:15 remaining in the game, the Harvard men’s basketball team was on the verge of a major disappointment. But the Crimson, led by the play of junior co-captain Keith Wright, rose to the occasion and saved its best for last.
With a late three-point play and an assist to sophomore guard Christian Webster on the game-deciding three-pointer, Wright helped lift Harvard to a 69-66 victory over the Bulldogs at the Chace Athletic Center in Smithfield, R.I.
“It’s never easy to play on the road,” Webster said. “They outplayed us. We got lucky.”
Bryant was up, 31-30, at halftime, but the two teams swapped leads throughout the second frame, as neither squad was able to build an advantage greater than four points.
“From after the first four-minute timeout [of the opening half], we were really just in a back-and-forth battle the entire time,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said.
Midway through the half, after Wright posted up on the right block for an easy bucket and then scored off an offensive rebound, the Crimson found itself ahead, 55-51, and looked poised to take control of the game. But the Bulldogs rallied back, as a loose rebound was tipped out to the three-point line, where sophomore Frankie Dobbs knocked down a trey.
The two teams continued to battle until, with Harvard up, 62-61, Bryant forward Alex Francis snuck around Wright on the baseline and finished at the rim for two points.
Francis was one of two freshmen, along with guard Corey Maynard, who had a breakout performance. The forward scored 14 points, 12 of which came in the second half, on 7-of-14 shooting. Maynard tallied 11 points, as well as 5 rebounds and 4 assists, though he shot just 1-of-6 from distance.
“[Maynard] was very good with the basketball and was able to drive into the key,” McNally said. “Francis is just an extremely explosive athlete…He was really tough to guard. It was pretty impressive for a freshman.”
After the Bulldogs took a 63-62 lead, McNally was called for a charge on the offensive end, and Bryant responded with a three-pointer from the left corner by senior guard Cecil Gresham. Trailing 66-62, the Crimson took a timeout with 1:15 on the clock.
Out of the break, Harvard went to Wright in the post, where the big man drew contact from Francis—his fifth foul—and connected on the shot. After Wright hit the ensuing free throw, the Crimson trailed, 66-65.
The Bulldogs had trouble finding a good shot on the next possession and settled for a three-pointer from the right corner by Maynard that barely grazed the rim.
“[Harvard coach Tommy Amaker] said to get some stops. We had no chance to win if we couldn’t stop them,” McNally said. “So we switched up our defense and were able to stop them down the stretch.”
With a chance to take the lead, Harvard moved the ball around until it found Wright on the left block. The junior, who finished the game with 24 points and 10 rebounds—his second double-double of the season—had a chance to make a move to the rim, but instead he swung the ball to an open Webster on the right wing. The sophomore knocked down the three-pointer, his second of the game, to give the Crimson a 68-66 lead with 23.2 seconds left.
“It takes a good leader like Keith and an unselfish player to know it’s not about him,” McNally said. “Christian was open, he had a big shot, and he just nailed it. It takes a lot of courage to take those shots in a game. But if Christian doesn’t make that shot, we don’t win the game.”
“I just try not to think about it,” Webster said of the pressure. “I just try to take it like any other shot.”
Bryant tried holding for the last shot, but Harvard, with five fouls to give, forced the Bulldogs to repeatedly take the ball from out of bounds.  With 4.9 seconds left, the inbounds pass ricocheted off a Bryant player’s leg and out of bounds to give the Crimson possession. With 0.4 seconds remaining, Webster went to the line, where he hit the first and intentionally missed the second, and Harvard escaped with a 69-66 win.
“I think [what] shows a little bit how resilient this team is the fact that we won the game,” McNally said. “We had a couple games the last couple years where games like that we would lose. But we came through.”
Lost in the drama of the win was the season debut of sophomore forward Kyle Casey. The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year made his return from a broken foot midway through the first half. Casey played just 14 minutes, finishing with five points, two rebounds, and three turnovers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore guard Christian Webster followed up a 29-point performance against Mercer on Saturday with a less flashy but very critical showing against Bryant this afternoon. With only 23 seconds left on the clock, Webster sank one of his two three-pointers of the afternoon to put Harvard up by two. The sophomore finished the game with nine points in 37 minutes, a sharp contrast from his production over the weekend, but his effort was nonetheless important for the Crimson's winning ways. Harvard has won the past three games after starting out the season with a loss to George Mason.
Another important highlight of the game was the return of sophomore forward Kyle Casey, who is recovering from a broken foot, an injury sustained previous to the start of the season. The forward played only a limited amount of minutes (14) but was able to contribute five points, two of which came from the free-throw line. The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year is obviously taking his time in an effort to return to the starting five. With several games left in its nonconference schedule and players like Webster stepping up for the team, the Crimson can afford to rest the star forward in order to get him ready for Ivy League play starting in January.

Though vuvuzelas were banned before having an opportunity to potentially become a Game Day tradition, they won’t soon be forgotten given that the Harvard University Archives added a vuvuzela to its permanent collection earlier this month.
After Eric M. Cervini '14 and Johnathon H. Davis '14 sold over 500 vuvuzelas as part of their “Silence Yale” campaign—an attempt to drown out Yalies during The Game with a grand chorus of red plastic noisemakers—the Archives decided that the overwhelming student response to the campaign warranted an addition to their collection. “Believe it or not, we do read The Crimson,” said Virginia A. Hunt, the archivist overseeing collection development at the Archives.
Cervini and Davis said they were surprised at the Archives’ interest in purchasing one of the vuvuzelas. “We were kind of amused at first,” said Cervini, “but it’s exciting to see it become part of history.”
The Harvard University Archives aims to document university life through a variety of artifacts, from budget reports to student diaries. “Going forward, we could see [the vuvuzela] as something people would find interesting 50 or 100 years from now,” said Hunt. Whether or not it's simply a passing fad, the vuvuzela is here to stay—at least in the Harvard University Archives.

ARYA MEHRABANZAD '14
RR: What do you like to eat on Thanksgiving?
AM: My mom makes a killer turkey and stuffing, but my favorite part is when she makes this, like, sweet potato casserole. So that’s the best.
RR: Do you ever make the sweet potato casserole?
AM: No.
RR: Do you cook at all?
AM: A little bit, after Thanksgiving though. I don’t want to ruin it for everybody.
RR: Turkey has a big carbon footprint. Have you considered eating tofurkey instead?
AM: Absolutely not. Turkey tastes too good.
RR: So, what are you thankful for?
AM: Family, friends. Being lucky to go to Harvard and all that.
RR: In recent news, Barbara Bush dissed Sarah Palin, and a boy wizard made $125 million at the box office. How do you think the Pilgrims would feel about the current state of the world?
AM: How do I answer that? I don’t know. How would you answer that question?
RR: I think they’d kind of like it. I don’t think the world is as screwed as we make it out to be.
AM: I agree with that. They’d be happy. They’d probably be happy because they started it all by coming over here.
RR: What’s your worst Thanksgiving memory?
AM: Once, I dropped the turkey while I was helping take it out of the oven. I’d say it’s not my fault, but it was pretty much my fault.
SARAH BOWER and ALICIA HARRIS, Florida
RR: What are your plans for Thanksgiving?
SB: We’re going out to an inn built in the 1700’s that serves Thanksgiving dinner.
RR: Cool. What’s your best Thanksgiving memory?
SB: Last year, my boyfriend’s mom burned the turkey. It looked like charcoal and it was six times smaller than it should have been.
RR: How long was that turkey in the oven?
SB: Like ten hours. Everyone else was gone and she fell asleep. So we had pizza for Thanksgiving dinner.
RR: Are you sure that’s not your worst Thanksgiving memory?
SB: Well, it was really funny so I liked it.
RR: Ever had tofurkey?
AH: Actually, yes, I was a vegetarian for ten years.
RR: What did you eat for Thanksgiving dinner when you were a vegetarian?
AH: I would have pasta and tofurkey. Tofurkey’s not bad. It’s just awkward because it’s a loaf. It’s softer and mushier than turkey.
DANIEL KAHNE, Chemistry Professor
RR: What are you cooking for Thanksgiving?
DK: My wife and I sort of cook turkey because we need to, but we make it interesting by making mole. It’s chocolatey and earthy. We make turkey less boring.
RR: Does your wife do most of the cooking, or do you?
DK: My wife’s a great cook. I just help her out.
RR: What are you thankful for?
DK: [Long silence.] I’m actually worrying about the people we’re electing. We’re handing over a messed up world to you guys.
RR: Fair enough. Do you think the outcome of last weekend’s game will put a damper on Yalies’ Turkey Day celebrations?
DK: Do we care?
LUCY F. MEDEIROS, Checker at Adams Dining Hall
RR: What will you do for Thanksgiving?
LM: Cook. I’m going to cook for my family. I usually make turkey and sometimes Brazilian food.
RR: What are your Thanksgiving highlights from years past?
LM: Going to my friends’ houses, my friends coming over to my house. Thanksgiving is nice, but it goes by fast.
RR: Does that mean you’re ready for Christmas?
LM: Yes. I have be. I have to start shopping early. I have four grandchildren.
RR: Really? Are you hitting up the sales on Black Friday?
LM: That’s too crazy. I did that once with my daughter. There are so many people that when the doors open, you have to run.
RR: Do you ever cook turkey for Christmas?
LM: No, because you make it on Thanksgiving, so if you’re going to make it on Thanksgiving, it’s like whaaat?! Turkey is a lot of meat. You don’t know what to do with it all.

Still stuck on campus doing psets and eating HUHDS food while many of your friends are already back home watching TV and dining on homemade cuisine?
Although other reforms to the academic calendar were enacted in 2009, the College still requires students to attend classes on the day before Thanksgiving, a policy that is reflected in the academic calendars of five other Ivy League institutions.
Despite this measure, however, many professors and teaching fellows have decided to either cancel Wednesday classes or make them optional for students to attend.
Xiaojing Yang '14 said that she disagrees with the College’s decision to hold classes on Wednesday. “Other schools like Yale are already starting break,” she said.
Yale and Dartmouth both have already revised their calendars to include the day before Thanksgiving as part of the designated period of break.
“All my classes on Wednesday have been canceled,” Yang said. “Professors and students alike would rather be with their families than be in school.”
Some students told us they decided that it is more  worth their time to skip class on Wednesday and leave on  Tuesday in order to enjoy a vacation long enough to warrant the travel.
“I’m skipping class tomorrow because it takes me six hours to get home,” said one freshman. “Given the fact that I haven’t seen my family and friends in months, I want to have as much time with them as possible.”
