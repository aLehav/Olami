After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is not every movie that references both T.S. Eliot and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Even fewer do so successfully. Perhaps only one such film falls into the horror genre. Horror movies are so often laughable that even being a modestly well-made film can render one noteworthy. “It Follows,” however, is more than noteworthy; it may well be a perfect film. Every aspect of the film—score, cinematography, screenplay, lighting—has been meticulously designed, each contributing another layer to the film’s overwhelming sense of dread. “It Follows” is at once groundbreaking and utterly foundational, taking one of the most atomic ideas in horror and creating around it a work that feels fresh and new. With aspirations beyond merely scaring the audience, the movie transcends the trappings of its genre and explores the questions of serious cinema.
Its premise, however, is simple. A pretty young blonde, Jay (Maika Monroe), goes out into the woods with a guy she has been dating, Hugh (Jake Weary). The two have sex in the back seat of his car. After their tryst, Jay wakes up, disoriented in a parking garage and bound to a wheelchair. Hugh tells her that when they slept together, he passed onto her a sort of curse. There was something following him, and now it is following her. It has no name. It can take any form. Apart from this, it has no special powers. It simply follows.
The sense of impending doom in “It Follows” is aided in large part by the synth-heavy score by Rich Vreeland. Vreeland, who writes music under the moniker Disasterpeace, gained notoriety for the grainy 8-bit soundtrack he created for the indie video game “Fez.” He brings the same feeling of eerie nostalgia with his score for “It Follows.” Despite being Vreeland’s debut in film scoring, the music in the film sounds instantly classic. The title theme could well be played alongside John Carpenter’s 1974 theme from “Halloween” completely suitably.
Even the film’s potential failings turn out to be assets. The acting of the young cast often feels stunted and unnatural, but this—along with the sparse and occasionally forced dialogue—only adds to the mood of alienation.Indeed, this unnatural dialogue is successful in part because of its scarcity. In many scenes, the principal characters sit together in silence, conveying their ennui in their inaction, freed from the limits of language.
Set against the backdrop of a deteriorating Detroit, the action of the film takes on a dark note. In one scene, Jay and her friends are driving along a suburban road when the focus of the camera drifts to the buildings outside the car. The graffitied walls and broken windows of the abandoned factories they pass are nearly as haunting as the thing that follows them. In fact, in its dilapidated ubiquity, the crumbling city seems to stalk the young adults with eerie persistence. The choice to set the film in the heart of the Rust Belt provides more than spooky scenery—it is a subtle hint at the film’s central theme.
Woven throughout the film’s gripping chase sequences is a meditation on the ephemeral nature of youth. Early in the film, Hugh jokes that he would like to be a child again so he could once more have the freedom to defecate wherever he might please. Jay laughs the comment off, but the joke seems to linger. The teens in “It Follows” are young. With each encounter with their persistent stalker, each time just barely evading its clutches, their lease on life runs down. Even as the credits begin to roll and the audience watches two kids walk hands-clasped into the sunset, there still exists a nameless, faceless specter lurking in their wake—death. Slowly but surely it follows.
“It Follows” is more successful as a film than most horror flicks. It is beautifully shot and scored, but its content is what sets the film apart from its peers and elevates it to the more serious but no less exciting cadre that is art. Instead of offering its viewers 90 minutes of cheap scares, it uses horror to grapple with questions that truly haunt. Because unlike curses or demons, the horror at the center of the film actually exists. Slowly but surely it follows. It will always follow.

White Privilege Lady enters the classroom donning a condescending smirk, a penguin waddle, and two uneven backpacks—one filled with books, the other empty.
The backpacks are a metaphor, she explains: Everyone walks around with an imaginary backpack (read: baggage), but only privileged Americans have the books (read: education, opportunities, resources) necessary to gain a step ahead. A girl in the class—wearing a middle school do-gooder facial expression—raises her hand and asks, "How do we make sure everyone has books?" White Privilege Lady’s solution? Move the books from one bag to the other. Mine? Fill both goddamn backpacks.
Now, this story takes place at a middle-school diversity conference, and as the absurd title we give our teacher makes clear, we are nowhere near educated enough to have a nuanced opinion on privilege. However, our teacher’s lesson, while not without limitations, has legitimate virtue in that it exposes a collection of obnoxious, prideful, bombastic private school seventh graders to the concept of white privilege.
But my gripe with White Privilege Lady at the time—her belief that privilege should be relocated, rather than proliferated—is just one example of a larger trend in which organizers lambast privilege instead of attempting to make it universal—a trend that has potentially detrimental effects and inadvertently leads people to tune out incredibly important movements like #BlackLivesMatter.
I’m white (as was my teacher, by the way). I’m private-school educated. I’m from New York. I was raised by two parents. I go to Harvard. All this to say: It’s hard to be more privileged than I am. So, I acknowledge that for me to attempt to dictate how people around me, especially those less privileged than I am, interact with and view privilege is not only a limited pursuit, but also, possibly, a patronizing and condescending one. I get this.
I also get that my argument seems to fall in line with the conservative “pick yourself up by the bootstraps,” “I’m not willing to pay higher taxes,” “I want to birth Ayn Rand’s spawn” sentiment you hear from Republican politicians. But that type of hands-off approach to addressing racial inequality—an approach that has fallen short time and time again throughout American history—is not what I am advocating for.
When we talk about white privilege, we are not only talking about combatting institutions like segregation, police brutality, and the criminal justice system. We are talking about the manifestations of systemic inequality that play out on a personal level. We are talking about a fight to make certain privileges—ones that white Americans unconsciously reap the rewards of every day—rights for all Americans.
We are talking about a fight to make sure every citizen has a path to higher-education not limited by her race, gender, or class; to make sure all children are safe from prejudice; to make sure that everyone can walk past a police officer without fear of being killed.
Don’t empty your backpack of the the right to make an argument without people assuming your opinion is dictated by race; to cross the street without hearing nearby cars lock their doors; to talk about what college you go to without feeling like affirmative action is some sort of elephant in the room.
These privileges shouldn’t be taken out of anybody’s proverbial backpack. They simply shouldn’t be privileges. After all, what White Privilege Lady referred to as privileges are not the kind of thing you can just transfer from one person to another like tax dollars, charity, or literature. They are the fundamental liberties that people from all backgrounds and political points of view should possess. It is the responsibility of every American, especially those with privilege, to actively work to make these privileges universal rights.
While many people of color are forced to grapple with double consciousness—a constant awareness of how one is viewed by outsiders based on her race, in addition to how she views herself—I have the privilege of living an unconscious existence when it comes to race. And without actively pursuing equality, I would never have to think about it.
There needs to be a paradigm shift that forces white (not to mention straight, cis, male, wealthy, and able-bodied) Americans to acknowledge their privilege and then work towards making it omnipresent—to see what’s in their backpack, and then work tirelessly to ensure it’s in everyone else’s.
These privileges should be rights as basic to Americans as the first ten amendments of the Constitution.
If we view them as such, we will work towards a future in which privilege becomes the universal standard for all people—a future in which teachers feel the need to carry only one backpack as they awkwardly waddle into middle school diversity conferences faced with an audience of spoiled, pompomed, and privileged seventh graders.

Last March, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority began a pilot-program, set to expire this June, which has kept the T open until 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights and until 1 a.m. the rest of the week. Now, Boston officials are debating whether to extend late-night MBTA services, and are planning to make a final decision about the program’s future on April 15. Two weeks ago, Boston city councilors supported a resolution urging the continuation of late-night services; final decision, however, remains with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation board of directors. We join the Boston City Council in urging the program’s extension, which will serve to affirm Boston’s commitment to developing a world-class transportation system commensurate to its global status.
As the nation’s fifth-largest mass-transit system, the MBTA sees approximately 1.3 million passenger trips per day. Over the past nine months, its late-night services have proved especially useful for professionals working irregular hours and, of greatest interest to the Harvard community, for students. Boston is irrefutably a college town. With more than 360,000 college and university students in the metropolitan area, Boston has the demand for late-night T service. The city and state would be remiss not to provide such a crucial public good for such key sectors of its economy.
In addition to its immediate practical benefits, late-night T service is a component of the modernization that Boston’s mass transit infrastructure desperately needs. This year’s snowstorms pointed out major flaws in the system, which took a month to get back on track, and showed that Boston’s public transportation system has serious shortcomings to address if it wants to be prepared for the hosting of  the 2024 Olympics. Late-night T-service is a step in the right direction for a system yearning for modernization in many ways. “Every major city has [ways] for people to get around the city after midnight,” said Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu ’07, a co-filer of the Council resolution in support of continuing late-night service. “I think this past year’s pilot showed that late-night T service cuts across all sectors of Boston’s economy.”
Admittedly, the continuation of late-night service presents some downsides. The cost of the pilot year amounted to $12.9 million, only 16.5 percent of which was covered by revenues. The MBTA, however, has suggested increasing its fares (which, with a CharlieCard, are still lower than those of major cities such as New York and Chicago) and partnering with local organizations and universities. Ultimately, with options for funding available, the Department of Transportation should not nix the program solely because of cost concerns. Late-night transportation is essential to serving the region and demonstrating Boston’s commitment to modernizing its public transportation infrastructure, and the Commonwealth must find a way to continue it.

Life is simpler when you plow around the stump. You’ll avoid breaking a disc blade or two on your tractor. It’s cheaper and easier than buying a special attachment. And if the roots on that son-of-a-bitch are strong and deep—which they always are—getting rid of them can take forever.
But farmers tend to be meticulous aestheticians, and a stump in a row of tomatoes sticks out like a sore, unseemly thumb. Those who rightly have more urgent concerns than how their crops look should also note that the soil under and around tree stumps is so fertile that it might be worth breaking a couple disc blades.
My point is, it’s not easy to plow through the stump, but you should.
Last Wednesday, two representatives from the Real Food Challenge—an organization that leverages the purchasing power of universities to promote a more sustainable, local food system—led a workshop (that they will repeat in this weekend’s Harvard Food Justice Conference) on plowing through stumps in a less literal, but vastly more crucial sense. They told us to close our eyes and to imagine that we were in a room—a 30-by-30-foot, pitch-black room with cement walls illuminated only by the sliver of ocean peeking through the gated doorway. This was the last sight over 12.5 million Africans experienced before they were brought to the New World to be enslaved into the most stubborn stump the world has ever known: the modern food system.
Plantation farming, fueled by the colonial obsession with maximizing profit and volume to feed an increasingly insatiable motherland, required a cheap, inexhaustible labor force that only slavery could provide. Farm owners systemically sacrificed basic human decency by catalyzing the ugliest institution in American history for a some extra bucks. They broke the fundamental pact between man and farm by destroying the land with foreign crops and irresponsible agriculture practices. And in doing all this, they sowed the seeds for today’s corporate enclosure of food and instilled scary, harmful consumption habits in us, despite the ensuing moral and environmental impact.
The emphasis on profit and volume in the food system did not die with slavery, and it still necessitates systematically oppressed labor just as it did centuries before. More than half of the laborers who work on American farm are undocumented and many more are migrant workers, bearing employment statuses that allow owners to pay them below living wages and to have them work in inhumane conditions. One farm worker dies on the job every day, and those who survive try to feed themselves and their families on the lowest annual income of any U.S. worker. The food that they grow and pick is on land wrecked by practices that date back to plantation farming like monocropping as well as modern innovations in the art of unsustainability like industrial pesticide and herbicide use. We have lost a third of the world’s arable land since the 1960s and considerably more since the peak of plantation farming centuries ago.
It’s uncomfortable to think about how intertwined the system that produces our food today is with as revolting, seemingly remote an institution as slavery. It’s far simpler to plow around the stump.
But to do so is to ignore the fact that it’s not just modern food production that has inherited the logic of slavery. Our consumption practices—the way we eat, the things we buy—are devoid of thought or care about where that food comes from, about who picked the bananas in the d-hall or raised the beef in our burger, about what the land that bore the sugar in our candy bar used to be before U.S. Sugar Corp. turned it into fields. We need to make eating a hyperconscious activity, to recognize that only conditioning ourselves to compulsively think before we eat will chip away at the extant residual effects of the most shameful era of American history. We need to plow through the stump, and when that inevitably seems too tough and not worth the while, we need to plow harder.

Members of Harvard’s sexual assault prevention task force updated the College’s Committee on Student Life on Thursday on its current initiatives, including expanding sexual assault education programming and using multimedia platforms for outreach.
Last April, amid debate over Harvard’s policies and approach to handling cases of alleged sexual assault, University President Drew G. Faust convened a task force to focus on sexual assault prevention efforts.
Two members of the task force—Lauren J. Urke ’15 and Stephanie R. Khurana, who is also a co-master of Cabot House—discussed ongoing communications and outreach efforts of one of the three subcommittees on the task force at the CSL’s meeting on Thursday morning. Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88 leads another subcommittee that is readying a climate survey to be released next month, and School of Public Health professor Lisa Berkman leads the third group, which is reviewing literature and other research on sexual harassment on college campuses, according to Khurana.
Khurana said the College has held 17 outreach meetings that attracted about 150 students. Administrators also talked individually to students.
“I feel like we got a good representation and created a safe environment where people were able to speak up and share their ideas,” Khurana said.
Khurana and Urke said upcoming College-based initiatives include: expanding sexual assault education programming beyond freshman orientation, utilizing multimedia to educate students on the issue, and thinking about social spaces on campus.
“People felt like it was a good start, but that [the] dialogue needed to continue,” Khurana said, referring to freshman orientation.
Some undergraduates present at the meeting emphasized a need to clarify language about sexual harassment, especially for freshmen from a diverse set of backgrounds.
“In large part, it’s not that people disagree with these ideas; it’s that a lot of people have never heard of them,” UC representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said, referring to the programming.
Urke pointed to the perceived success of other multimedia campaigns such as “Mothers Against Drunk Driving” or 2014’s “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign as models the task force is examining to capture undergraduates’ attention.
"We want to create awareness campaigns that could hopefully have a similar effect," she said, referring to the drunk driving initiative.
UC representative Samuel R. Kaplan ’18 suggested that the task force continue researching social spaces on campus open to undergraduates, and particularly freshmen.
The meeting also featured a demo of an upcoming mobile application the UC is developing, presented by Jason F. Herrmann ’18. The application, currently called “Omni” from Latin roots meaning “all,” is designed for undergraduates and based on a modified platform of one currently in use at Harvard Business school, according to UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16.
Goyal said he thinks the application will present information better than the current official Harvard University mobile application. The application, which Goyal said the UC will start publicizing in mid-April, will also integrate information from another event application the UC introduced earlier this semester.
“The transition to mobile reflects a new strategy that we’re using to interact with students,” UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 said.

The Graduate School of Design has raised a little more than $1 million since the public launch of its fundraising efforts last September, when it had raised $69 million during its quiet phase, according to Theresa A. Lund, the managing director of the GSD Dean's Office.
The total, $70.2 million as of Feb. 28, represents more than 60 percent towards the school's goal of $110 million.
In an interview Thursday, Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi outlined three major priorities for the campaign: increased financial support for students, improvements to the “infrastructure,” including renovated and expanded facilities, and increased support for faculty and research.
Mostafavi said “financial support for students has to be at the forefront of our campaign” due to high levels of debt incurred by GSD students.
“The financial rewards upon completion as an architect are not very high,” Mostafavi said. “It does mean that students who make the commitment to those types of subjects have a higher-than-normal debt.”
Mostafavi said the school’s donor mix was “quite varied” because of its non-alumni donor base, singling out the large gift from the Evergrande Real Estate Group that helped establish the Center for Green Buildings and Cities.
“For a school like the GSD, it is imperative to have a very broad donor base,” he sais, adding that “the alumni with a background in design don’t always have numerous opportunities...to make large donations."
Mostafavi said the campaign has taken up a significant amount of his time, in part because of outreach to non-alumni donors.
“Because it is not necessarily only our alumni we are relying on, it means that we have to be prepared to discuss our plans, our projects, our agenda, our sort of aspirations, sometimes with people who don’t really know enough or they don’t know a lot about the school,” Mostafavi said. “What we call kind of the cultivation period or the amount of time that’s necessary to commit to this follow-up is quite immense.”
Beyond student financial support, updates mostly focused on energy efficiency and structural maintenance to the school’s existing space in Gund Hall, which will begin as early as this summer, according to Mostafavi. The school is also in the early stages of planning an addition to Gund for research space, classrooms, and offices. It will also provide spaces that are in short supply in Gund, such as medium-sized rooms, Mostafavi said.
The addition was described as a “five-story research tower” at the September campaign launch, but Mostafavi said Thursday that the word "tower" is “a little bit of an exaggeration.”

The University Benefits Committee is actively considering offering an increased number and variety of health benefits options for non-union employees next year, including a plan that looks similar to the one offered in 2014 with increased premiums, according to committee members.
According to UBC Chair Michael E. Chernew, who is also a professor of health care policy at the Medical School, the UBC might “look at reoffering the 2014 benefits package” with a few alterations involving copay rates and deductible. The committee would also consider offering that plan alongside the existing plan or a slightly modified version. If both are offered next year, a revised 2014 plan is expected to have higher premiums than an updated version of this year’s plan, according to Chernew.
“We’re thinking about expanding the set of choices,”  Chernew said, adding that “communications [are] also a challenge and we would like to do a better job.”
Changes introduced to the 2015 health benefits plan, which were first unveiled last September and rolled out in January, have come under considerable fire from faculty, who criticized the increase in costs for non-union staff—especially junior faculty—and what they perceived as a lack of communication between them and administrators.
After a unanimous vote by members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences calling on University President Drew G. Faust to repeal the policy, the new health benefits plan to roll out as planned, but she also established a reimbursement program designed to support faculty and staff whose health care costs, excluding premiums, exceed 3 percent of their salaries.
The UBC held three information sessions over the last few weeks for faculty and non-union University employees to field questions and explain the package and its changes. Following these meetings, several UBC members said changes would “likely” be made to future health benefits plans offered.
The Faculty Council, the highest elected body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, discussed the UBC’s deliberations with Chernew during its meeting on Wednesday.
East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor Mark C. Elliott, who sits on the Faculty Council, said he was “encouraged” by the committee’s efforts and expressed “cautious optimism” about the future of the benefits plans.
“To me that seemed to indicate that they had taken some of the response that FAS faculty, in particular, had made when the news of the change to the health care benefit package was made early in the fall,” Elliot said. “[It seemed] that they had taken that to heart and they were looking hard at all available options.”
Faculty Council member and Comparative Literature professor David Damrosch said it was apparent that the UBC was taking a variety of plans into consideration.
“They are clearly trying to work a very difficult set of issues,” Damrosch said. “They are doing the best to open up different possibilities without overwhelming people with the complexities of different healthcare plans."
Council members said that in the last few months, Provost Alan M. Garber '76 and the UBC had made efforts to better communicate with the faculty and have been using the Council as a point of contact. The University released a detailed fact sheet in early February outlining Harvard’s health care expenditures, and Chernew said that improving communications with faculty and others affected by the UBC’s recommendations is on the committee’s agenda.
Additionally, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 attended a Council meeting on Feb. 11 to discuss issues of administrative transparency, pledging to meet with the body at least once a semester.
“Provost Garber was of the same ideal of communication [as the UBC], and I think that’s all a positive development,” Council member and Germanic Languages and Literatures department chair John T. Hamilton said.

Members of student activist groups Divest Harvard and the Student Labor Action Movement partnered and distributed flyers for their causes at a University-organized event outside the Science Center on Thursday.
University President Drew G. Faust sent a campus-wide email last week publicizing the event, which was meant to mark the end of a snowy winter and give thanks to “everyone who kept Harvard running smoothly” during the snowstorms that forced many Harvard schools to cancel classes.
Event attendees were served hot chocolate and made s’mores as student activists discussed climate change and the difficulty the storms placed on Harvard employees. Nina R. Wagner ’18, a member of SLAM, said the groups partnered because they believe that the intense storms were caused at least in part by climate change, and those storms greatly affected the University's workers.
The activist groups requested that students sign a thank-you card for Harvard staff and Harvard University Dining Services workers. They also distributed flyers about the “intersections between social justice and climate change, especially as it pertains to transportation going down for workers and it especially affecting low income and communities of color,” said Naima Drecker-Waxman ’18, a member of Divest Harvard, which advocates for Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies.
Members of both organizations emphasized that they were not there to stage a protest, but rather to call attention to what they see as the disproportionate effect the storms have had on Harvard employees. The groups plan to collaborate again in the spring during a rally for increasing the minimum wage.

The slow climb in temperatures marks the end of the off-season for tour companies in Harvard Square. Although this past winter buried many tour group businesses in weeks of slow or no sales—especially those that depend on last-minute bookings—the damage was lessened by the industry’s anticipation of such seasonal cycles, according to tourism company employees.
For Trademark Tours, the company behind the "Hahvahd Tour," business did not noticeably differ from previous winters. CEO and founder Daniel Andrew attributed the steady numbers to the fact that most customers during the colder months are large companies that have scheduled months in advance.
“Even though the winter was very harsh, it really didn’t have as big of an impact as you might think,” Andrew said. “The Square is weather-proofed for group tours. They find a way to come and get their money’s worth.”
Other businesses choose to shut down for the off-season. Stewart E. Smith, a tour guide for Cambridge Historical Tours, said doing so allowed his company to avoid the storms completely.
The tour groups hardest hit by the weather relied on impulse ticket sales. Michael Chandler, director of sales and advertising for Old Town Trolley Tours, names this past winter as the worst the business has ever seen. Despite sustaining losses greater than 50 percent of normal attendance, however, business during the colder months is naturally so slow to begin with that the losses were not felt too deeply, said Chandler, who called himself "the Professor.”
“It’s not nearly as bad for us as it is for, say, a restaurant. From what I understand, they’ve been really hit because their business isn’t as cyclical as ours is,” Chandler said. “We can live through it.”
Chandler voiced his concern over the impact this winter’s heavy media coverage may have on the number of prospective tourists choosing to visit Cambridge in the coming year.
“Currently, all that’s happened in the news cycle is bad—ice and snow and terrible cold,” Chandler said. “Bad weather is a terrific ratings boost [for media outlets], but that kind of news depresses business.”
Even so, Chandler admits his company’s immediate prospects are not all negative.
“The mantra has become, ‘Thank goodness it doesn’t snow in July,’” he said.

Karen Nelson Moore ’70, a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, will lead the Harvard Board of Overseers—the University’s second-highest governing body—as its new president for the 2015-2016 academic year, the University announced on Thursday.
Moore will steer the Overseers executive committee with newly elected vice chair Diana Nelson ’84, who chairs the board of hotel and travel company Carlson. According to University spokesperson Jeff Neal, administrators “believe that this is the first time that two women have served in these roles concurrently.”
The Board of Overseers, which is composed of 30 Harvard affiliates, works below the Harvard Corporation, Harvard’s highest governing body. Elected by alumni for six-year terms, the overseers advise University leaders, review schools and departments, and approve major Corporation decisions, such as the appointment of a new University president.
Both elected to the Board in 2010, Moore and Nelson will respectively replace Morgan Chu, a Los Angeles-based intellectual property lawyer, and Walter Clair ’77, a cardiologist.
Since graduating from Radcliffe in 1970, Moore has previously held positions including vice president of the Harvard Alumni Association, trustee of Radcliffe College, and elected director of the Radcliffe College Alumni Association.
Nelson, a fundraiser, is a member of the Harvard Campaign’s executive committee and the Committee on University Resources, which includes many major donors. She formerly held the roles of co-chair of the Harvard College Fund—which raises money for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and chair of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ task force on women and leadership.
“Karen Moore and Diana Nelson are both remarkably thoughtful, insightful, and dedicated Overseers, and it will be a privilege to work with them even more closely next year,” University President Drew G. Faust in a statement. “We are fortunate to have two such accomplished and devoted alumnae to lead the board.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months after first applying, Felipe’s Taqueria has received approval from the Cambridge License Commission on its liquor license application and could begin serving liquor as early as Friday at 5 p.m., according to co-owners Felipe Herrera and Tom Brush.
The Mexican restaurant opened at its new 21 Brattle St. location without a liquor license late last year. The complicated process required to obtain the liquor license has delayed the popular restaurant’s plans to serve liquor, Herrera said.
“We waited for almost three months,” Herrera said. “It’s kind of complicated, but we finally got [approval].”
While the restaurant’s liquor license application was approved, the owners have yet to receive the physical license itself, preventing them from specifying when exactly they can begin to serve alcohol.
“You really can’t know until you physically have [the liquor license] in your hand,” Brush said.
Despite the delays, Herrera said bar staff have undergone training and are expecting to introduce a full-menu of alcoholic drinks in the coming weeks. The bar, which has been empty since Felipe’s move to Brattle Street, is expected to soon be in service.
“The margaritas will have freshly squeezed lime; we love to do everything fresh,” Herrera said.
Ben L. Donald ’15 said he expects that the liquor license will help transform the atmosphere of the popular eatery to become a place for social meet-ups.
“The liquor license will help make it more of a destination than just a place for a quick bite to eat,” he said. “I could easily see myself hanging out at the bar with some friends, grabbing a plate of nachos and some margaritas, and having a great time.”
The introduction of the liquor license will likely help to drive up sales, Herrera said. He added that if the alcoholic drinks prove popular, he may decide to introduce live music.
Donald expressed excitement over Felipe’s impending liquor license. “If only this had happened earlier than the second half of senior spring,” Donald said.

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Graduate School of Design are planning to launch a joint master’s degree program in engineering design, according to three professors involved in the project.
The Faculty will likely vote on the new degree before the end of this semester, according to SEAS professor Woodward Yang, who is involved in the planning of the program.
The program will “hopefully” be launched next year, according to Materials Science professor Joanna Aizenberg, who sits on the committee spearheading the project.
Aizenberg added that the committee had hoped to launch the new program as early as this fall, but the process has been stalled by difficulties coordinating programs between SEAS and the Design School, whose curricula differ significantly.
The new degree would join what is currntly a limited offering of master’s programs at SEAS, a school that largely offers Ph.D. degrees. Its only existing master’s programs are in Computational Science and Engineering, which focuses on data science and enrolled its first students in 2013, and in Electrical Engineering. The latter program offers admission only in “exceptional circumstances,” according to the school’s website.
According to Interim SEAS Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68, SEAS administrators are exploring possibilities to offer new certificate programs and other master’s programs. “We are exploring ways in which our intellectual strengths can be brought to bear on identifiable educational needs,” he wrote in an email.
Stephen M. Ervin, the Design School's assistant dean for information technology, said he is “extremely enthusiastic” about the idea of bringing design and engineering together.
“It’s not that these are opposite terms by any means,” he said. “Bringing together the strengths of these two schools at Harvard can only be fabulous.”
Aizenberg said she thinks there is a “natural merger” between the two schools, because design and engineering are inseparable. “[The designers] tend to sacrifice efficiency for beauty, whereas [the engineers] tend to sacrifice beauty for efficiency,” she said. “The outcome is that a lot of materials and buildings are either too expensive or ugly.”
Over the last year, SEAS and the GSD have been working closely together, resulting in greater interactions between the faculties, as well as a number of cross-listed courses, according to Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi.
For example, a popular Design School course on design research methods that integrated SEAS technology into its content will be cross-listed in SEAS as Engineering Sciences 291 starting this fall, according to Aizenberg.

As the New York regional office of the National Labor Relations Board will hold a hearing on March 31 on whether graduate students at Columbia have the right to form a union, graduate students at Harvard say a ruling in favor of unionization rights might prompt interest in a similar movement in Cambridge.
If the NLRB ultimately rules in support of the graduate students, it would reverse an earlier 2004 ruling under the Bush administration that allowed universities to ban unions among graduate students, arguing that they are primarily students and any work they do is part of their degree program.
Some graduate students at Harvard are hopeful that the NLRB will vote in favor of the Columbia students.
“I can’t predict whether it would lead to a serious public unionization effort here or at Princeton, for example, or not, but I certainly think it would make it more likely,” said John Gee, a graduate student in the History department.
Some graduate students, especially those who had been part of unions at other schools, are often surprised when they discover that Harvard has no such infrastructure, according to Jonathan J. Booth, a graduate student in the History department.
John M. Nicoludis, a graduate student in the Chemistry department, said he has learned through conversations with his peers that many would support a union.
“This would, depending on the decision, be a huge change in how universities interact with graduate students and would change what being a graduate student means,” he said. “I think some graduate students at Harvard are starting to wonder how a union could support their needs during graduate school.”
Legal experts say it is difficult to predict how the NLRB will rule, though some hope it will reverse the 2004 decision.
“I would imagine that the current NLRB will support the rights of graduate student teaching assistants to collectively bargain,” said William B. Gould IV, a former chairman of the NLRB under President Bill Clinton and a professor emeritus of law at Stanford.
James A. Gross, professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell, agreed that the NLRB should rule in favor of unionization rights.
Supporters of the 2004 decision, meanwhile, argue that allowing the formation of unions puts academic freedom at risk. In a press statement, Columbia officials wrote, “Our graduate students are scholars in training whose teaching and research are an integral part of their doctoral studies. As the N.L.R.B. found in the Brown University case, we believe that treating students as employees could adversely affect their educational experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
His Holiness the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa Ogyen T. Dorje spoke about the interdependence of all living creatures and the dangers of apathy at a lecture on Thursday. The Karmapa, the leader of one sect of Buddhism, stopped at Harvard on his two-month tour of the United States to deliver a lecture on “Caring for Life on Earth in the Twenty-first Century.”
David N. Hempton, dean of Harvard Divinity School, welcomed the Karmapa and referred to the school’s longstanding relations with representatives of Tibetan Buddhism. He made specific reference to the 16th Karmapa’s visit to Harvard in 1976 and the 14th Dalai Lama’s visit in 2009.
The Karmapa, who gave his lecture via a translator, began his talk with an allusion to a visit in his past life and said he was very glad to be back at Harvard. He recounted an experience from his youth in which he saw the tribe of nomads he was raised with suffocate an animal for its meat. He said he experienced an intense and unbearable feeling that he could not explain.
“I miss that degree of genuine, unfabricated feeling,” he said.
The Karmapa equated this degree of feeling with children’s innate capacity for love and kindness. He urged people to adopt this capacity, which he said people tend to lose with adulthood. “I think our sympathy can extend to all living beings, including to animals," he said.
The Karmapa continued to emphasize the value of interdependence and argued that compassion is something that people need to experience, rather than understand. People need to realize that everything is interdependent, and that everything we have comes from other beings, he argued.
“In a sense, the most dangerous thing in the world is apathy,” the Karmapa said. Unlike violence, warfare, and disease, which can be avoided, people cannot defend against apathy once it takes hold, he argued.
Julie Gillette, Buddhist ministry coordinator at the Divinity School said the school was eager to host the Karmapa as soon as they learned of his continental tour. “We felt that young people could make a connection to him and could relate to what he talks about,” she said.
Roderick L. Owens, a first year master of Divinity student and a Lama of Tibetan Buddhism, said he found the Karmapa’s remarks especially relevant in the context of the United States.
“I think it is important for His Holiness to be here right now in the United States and give his reflections on many of the problems we’re facing, especially racial injustice, the environment, the economy, and our ability to live harmoniously,” Owens said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For three weeks, the No. 10/8 Harvard men’s hockey team had only one goal: win the ECAC Men’s Hockey Tournament to guarantee a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
And, with wins over No. 11/11 Quinnipiac and Colgate in Lake Placid last weekend, the Crimson finally did just that.
In its push to bring the Whitelaw Cup back to Cambridge for the first time since 2006, the team notched accomplishments that, when taken out of the context of the championship push, stand on their own merit.
Harvard finally overcame its shortcomings against archrival Yale in the ECAC quarterfinals and did so in dramatic fashion with a double overtime winner from junior forward Jimmy Vesey.
“[Beating Yale] was one of my favorite moments of the season,” Vesey said.
Individual accomplishments also stood out during the run. Vesey had one of the best statistical seasons in program history, leading Division I in goals on the season with 31 en route to winning the Walter Brown Award.
Along with Vesey, fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally returned unexpectedly from a knee injury to knot the equalizing goal in the rubber match of the same Yale series en route to being named, along with junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo, to the All-ECAC Second Team.
“It’s definitely rewarding to have a good season this year,” Criscuolo said. “Some of these other guys [and I], we had great options other than Harvard to go, and they’ve had some good seasons along the way and you might think about that for a second. But...you can’t give up the chance to come to Harvard….You feel blessed to be here.”
But even though the Crimson pulled through and took home the conference title, the team will not spend this week celebrating. Rather, Harvard will spend it preparing to accomplish its next goal. None of the excitement of the turnaround season will make an early-round exit for the team in the NCAA Tournament any easier on the players.
The Crimson (21-12-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) travels to South Bend to take on No. 9/9 Nebraska-Omaha in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Saturday night. The winner will take on either No. 2/2 Minnesota St. Mankato or the Rochester Institute of Technology on Sunday for a chance to advance to the Frozen Four in Boston.
The Mavericks (18-12-6, 12-8-4 NCHC)  did not have to go through the ordeal the Crimson did in order to earn a tournament berth. Despite being swept in the first round of the NCHC playoffs by No 13/13 St. Cloud State, the team ranked eighth in the PairWise Ranking at the end of the year and comfortably earned an at-large berth in the tournament.
“Being in a situation where you have to win two best-of-three series and the semifinal game against Quinnipiac...makes us battle-tested,” Vesey said. “To face that pressure and come out with the ECAC championship gives us confidence going forward. Omaha…[hasn’t] played a playoff game in a while. That could work in our advantage.”
Even without the postseason experience, as the team has not played since March 14, the Mavericks still pose a threat to end the Crimson’s season on Saturday night. Sophomore forwards Jake Guentzel and Austin Ortega ranked ninth and eleventh, respectively, in points in the NCHC, while senior goaltender Ryan Massa led the conference with a  save percentage of .934.
“Their goaltender has been outstanding all year,” Harvard coach Ted Donato `91 said. “In a one-game set, I think we’re going to really try to focus on our game and what we want to bring instead of being reactive. We’ll certainly have a lot of respect for Nebraska-Omaha.”
While Vesey is the obvious answer to solve Massa in net, the team will not depend on him to win the game, instead calling upon its depth to secure a victory against the Mavericks as it has in the past few weeks.
Senior forward Colin Blackwell and sophomore forward Tyler Moy have stepped up in the past few weekends. Blackwell scored two goals over the last two games in the ECAC tournament, while Moy added a goal and an assist.
Along with the strength of the team’s top point earners, it also has many other players waiting in the wing if need be.
“I honestly think our depth has the potential to be a strength for us,” Donato said. “We expect that everyone in our lineup can be helpful to us winning.”

In what seems like is becoming an annual tradition, five of Harvard College’s top student bands will perform tonight in the Battle for Yardfest for the chance to open up for this year’s Yardfest headliner, Grammy-nominee Jessie J. Out of the five who will perform from 7 to 10 p.m. in the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub, only two will be selected.
Victory depends on who can turn out the largest number of students and earn the highest number of votes at the end of the evening. Student-artists will be featuring music style ranging from 90s rock to “nature rap.” The bands that will play tomorrow night include Black Tie Affair, who will open the show at seven, and Bared Grillz, the Intrinsics, the Solars, and Xkaban Jones and Dorian Grusoe.
Ben Blumstein ’15, the vocalist behind Bared Grillz, said that students should expect a sound unlike any they have ever heard before. He said that Bared Grillz produces rap about the wilderness, communing with mother nature, and breaking out of all the trappings of society.
“The crowd should expect massive jungle rhythms, a lot of sweat, a lot of energy, and I’d say a coming together in a moment of a return to a primordial state of nature,” Blumstein added. “We are the only people in the world making this kind of music and I think this is the future...we are trying to bring it to Yardfest, it’s the perfect venue out in nature, the way it was meant to be.”
He said that he plans to treat tomorrow night at the Queen’s head like it is Madison Square Garden, or the TD Garden arena in Boston.
Vibav Mouli ’16, a vocalist in Black Tie Affair, said students should expect a high-energy set full of dance music, 90s rock, and good vibes.
“We know what the crowd wants, they desire an incredible show and we feel confident that we can deliver that,” Mouli said, adding that the chance to open up for Yardfest is the “coolest opportunity you could possibly have here at Harvard.”
Mouli added that Black Tie Affair already has performed one show at Queen’s Head earlier this year, with a large crowd, and that it almost “feels like a home turf.”
But at the end of the night, whose home turf will it be? Do it for these awesome bands. Do it in memory of Hot Breakfast. Whatever the reason, come out tomorrow night to hear the some of Harvard’s best student musicians.

You’ve probably already heard by now, but Jessie J will be headlining Yardfest 2015! We’ve got you covered with a study guide incase you need to brush up on her music, but still have more questions about her?
What does the J stand for?Jessie J’s real name is Jessica Cornish. So then what does the J represent? Apparently, depending on the day and her mood, the J stands for different things. “Jessie Jazz-hands” is one of her favorites, along with “Jessie Jetlag.”
What, she’s British?Yup! Jessie J was born and brought up in London, England. She studied at the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology, and oftentimes had lunch and hung out with fellow student Adele while attending school.
How about some more history on Jessie J?Remember Miley Cyrus’s song “Party in the USA?” Yeah, well your girl Jessie J wrote co-wrote it with two others for Miley! The royalties from the song paid her rent for three years. Jessie J’s also written for Alicia Keys and almost even for Rihanna as well, but ended up using that song, “Do It Like a Dude,” as her own). Jessie J was also formerly a part of a girl group called Soul Deep.
Why do people confuse Katy Perry and Jessie J?It probably stems from the confusion people have that Katy Perry sang what’s actually Jessie J’s song “Domino.” They also do both have strikingly powerful vocals and sleek and bold hairstyles.
Jessie J shaved her head on live TV once?Yes! Back in 2013, she donated her hair to the Little Princess Trust, which makes real hair wigs for children suffering from hair loss.

What do cake, entrepreneurship, history and astrophysics have in common? A lot, according to Alice S. Han ‘16 and Nina L. Hooper ‘16. They are the co-founders of The Holistic, a healthy baked goods startup that is two years in the works. Oh, and history and astrophysics are their respective concentrations.
The Feel Good Cake is their signature product– it is vegan, gluten free, and has no refined sugar. The philosophy behind this cake is to embody “a health bar in a cake,” says Han. Creating this cake was no small feat for the two Australian juniors. The recipe for the chocolate cake has gone through at least 50 iterations, with many tweaks to each ingredient along the way. For example, the addition of apple cider vinegar to their recipe was a way to mimic some of the functions of ordinary baking soda. And nope, incase you were wondering, neither Han nor Hooper has taken Science and Cooking, but they have met the professors, who are very supportive of their initiative.
Hooper, who has been a vegan for two years, and Han, who is not a vegan, decided to make their product free of eggs, sugar, dairy and the like in order to appeal to Hooper’s dietary restrictions and the lifestyle choices of their friends.
Juggling classes, homework, and college life, the two have come a long way from taste-tasting their cake amongst their friends and at weekly PAF study breaks, to now catering Harvard Business School events and hosting a pop-up market at the Harvard Square Anthropologie. They are currently selling their 190-calorie product as an individually-packaged chocolate cake for $1.99 at Broadway Market.
With every batch of cakes baked, Han and Hooper learned how to grow and manage a business. Han states that she has learned many “real world lessons,” from marketing and brand awareness to composing emails. The greatest lesson she has learned throughout the whole process however is “the ability to bounce back from failure.” This perseverance has allowed them to exhibit their product in unconventional spaces, such as within goodie bags at this year’s New York Fashion Week.
Looking ahead, Han and Hooper hope to launch their cakes as an in-flight dining option, in addition to increasing their flavor range of cakes, such as almond butter and banana, matcha and red bean paste, and blueberry vanilla.
Just last week, Han and Hooper launched their Kickstarter, with the hopes of raising $15,000 as seed money so they can begin to outsource production, distribution, and delivery. While their video depicts them traveling the world baking their Feel Good Cake, to Han and Hooper, it represents more than just the two of them as business partners. They are also best friends who bonded over not only baking and healthy eating, but also their love of travel.
