After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawyers for Harvard argued that state and federal judges should dismiss a pair of ongoing lawsuits alleging the College’s social group sanctions are discriminatory Friday evening.
Two motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the University argue that the social group penalties do not disadvantage either sex and do not limit undergraduates’ freedom of association.
The motions mark the latest development in two lawsuits filed in December 2018 – one in federal court and the other in Massachusetts — that challenge the legality of Harvard’s controversial social group sanctions, alleging the penalties are coercive and illegal.
Plaintiffs in the Massachusetts case are the international parent group of sorority Alpha Phi, Harvard’s newly reinstated chapter of Alpha Phi, and a management company for chapters of sorority Delta Gamma. Their federal counterparts are the international organizations for two sororities, Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma; the parent groups for two fraternities, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi; Harvard’s chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon; and three current Harvard students — not named in the suit — who are also members of all-male social clubs.
The College’s sanctions, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding athletic team captaincies, leadership positions in campus organizations, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
In a memorandum accompanying Harvard’s motion to dismiss the federal suit, lawyers for the University argued that the sanctions policy does not contribute to sex-based discrimination “because the challenged policy treats men and women equally.”
The University also addressed allegations made by the plaintiffs in their original complaints that the policies infringe upon students’ freedom of association. Harvard’s Massachusetts filing argues that student social groups are not the kinds of “intimate associations and expressive associations” legally protected by the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act and that the sanctions policy “places no burden” on the organizations’ activities.
“The policy does not regulate the sororities in any way,” the state filing reads. “It does not, for example, bar sororities from continuing to meet and hold social events for other students on campus. It does not tell them what they can or cannot say or express.”
Harvard’s filings in both cases also argue that not all plaintiffs have standing to bring the suits because the Greek organizations, which allege that the sanctions illegally discriminate against students in fraternities and sororities, are speaking on behalf of their members. The federal motion further argues that John Doe 3 — one of the anonymous student plaintiffs who, as an upperclassman, is not subject to the sanctions — also does not have standing because the penalties do not apply to him.
Lawyers for the University addressed in their filings the plaintiffs’ allegations that the College employed “threats, intimidation or coercion” when debuting the sanctions. The motions to dismiss the suits argue students had full knowledge of the sanctions policy when they decided to attend the College.
“Plaintiffs concede that Harvard’s policy applied only prospectively to students who had not yet chosen even to apply, let alone matriculate at the time the policy was enacted. And Plaintiffs certainly do not allege that any student was intimidated or coerced into attending Harvard,” the federal motion reads. “Therefore, all of the students subject to the policy voluntarily accepted it when, fully on notice, they elected to attend Harvard.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in a press release that single-gender social groups are not consistent with the values and goals the College tries to promote.
“Harvard should not have to change its commitment to non-discrimination and educational philosophy for outside organizations that are not aligned with our long-standing mission,” Dane wrote.
Emma Quinn-Judge, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the state suit, wrote in an email that the plaintiffs “believe Harvard’s motion will be legally meritless.”
“It appears that in particular Harvard has nothing to say about the impact of the policy on single-sex women’s groups,” Quinn-Judge wrote.
The plaintiffs in both the state and federal lawsuits will officially respond to Harvard’s motions over the next several weeks. Harvard has requested court hearings to discuss both complaints.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allegations of plagiarism embroiled former New York Times Executive Editor and Harvard lecturer Jill E. Abramson ’76, whose latest book, “Merchants of Truth,” came under scrutiny from journalists Wednesday.
In a series of tweets published Wednesday evening, Vice News correspondent Michael C. Moynihan accused Abramson of plagiarizing portions of her book, released Tuesday, which covers the volatile climate of journalism in the last decade.
Moynihan wrote on Twitter that he became conscious of instances of alleged plagiarism while reviewing claims Abramson made about Vice within the book.
News organizations from which Moynihan explicitly accused Abramson of plagiarizing include the New Yorker, Time Out Magazine, Columbia Journalism Review, and Ryerson Review of Journalism. He also cited a master’s thesis from Ryerson University and York University, which he alleges Abramson copied.
On Twitter, Moynihan juxtaposed the passages in question from Abramson’s book with passages from previously published articles, revealing uncanny similarities — including specific details, phrases, and nearly identical sentences. Abramson did not include footnotes to these passages.
Abramson acknowledged in an email to The Crimson that she made citation errors in the book but that the errors were “completely unintentional.”
“I did not have citations for seven short passages that contain factual information. These should have been either quoted in the text or footnoted,” she wrote.
She noted that she had included more than 70 pages worth of footnotes covering hundreds of interviews.
“I did properly credit these sources, some repeatedly, for other passages and material in the book. This makes clear that my errors were completely unintentional,” she wrote.
“Anyone who knows or has worked with me knows that I would never intentionally use any other journalist’s work without giving them credit,” she added.
One of the authors whom Abramson allegedly plagiarized, former Time Out Senior Editor Jake Malooley, directed The Crimson to his statement made via Twitter.
“In a pretty brazen violation of journalism 101 ethics, Jill Abramson cribbed a passage from an article I wrote in 2010 and passed it off as her own,” the tweet reads.
The article in question, published in Time Out Magazine, spotlighted a Vice correspondent and his experience reporting in the Middle East.
Another writer whom Abramson allegedly plagiarized, Matthew Ingram, published an article Thursday in the Columbia Journalism Review affirming his belief that Abramson plagiarized his work.
One of the passages under scrutiny from Abramson’s book is almost identical to an excerpt of Ingram’s 2018 article that cites the most popular news sources circulating on Facebook.
Ingram wrote that he does not feel as though Abramson stole his ideas — the passage did not contain his ideas, but rather facts, he points out.
Ingram, however, wrote that Abramson’s actions conform to what many would consider plagiarism, and he cited a past statement from Abramson in which she put forth a concurring definition.
Shortly after the New York Times was accused of plagiarizing two sentences in a 2008 article, Abramson — the Times’s then-managing editor — told Slate magazine, “When you take material almost word-for-word and don’t credit it, it is [plagiarism].”
An hour after Moynihan publicly accused Abramson of plagiarism Wednesday evening, she unequivocally denied on live television during “The Story with Martha MacCallum” that she committed any citation errors in her book.
“I certainly didn’t plagiarize in my book,” Abramson told the show’s host MacCallum.
Abramson then suggested that Moynihan accused her of plagiarism because Vice was unhappy with Abramson’s portrayal of the news organization in her book.
Moynihan did not respond to a request for comment.
Only three hours later, Abramson tweeted that she was looking into the accusations.
The following day, in a statement she provided to various news publications, Abramson admitted error and wrote that she would work to correct the mistakes. She added all of the ideas expressed in the book are “original.”
“She seems sincere ... that she cares about this and she wants to fix what went wrong. She described them as unintentional errors, and I have no reason to believe that that’s not the case,” Ingram said in an interview with The Crimson.
Moynihan’s Wednesday Twitter thread is not the first time Abramson's book has come under fire for inaccuracies. The book first faced scrutiny last month when a copy was provided to journalists for review in advance of publication.
Images of passages from the copy allegedly containing factual errors circulated on Twitter. Responding at the time, Abramson wrote in a Twitter post that the book was unfinished.
Abramson spent 17 years at the Times, where she was the first woman to lead the news organization as executive editor starting in 2011. She was fired from that role in 2014 due to disagreements with the Times’ publisher, according to a New Yorker article published shortly afterwards. In 2014, she joined Harvard’s English Department as a senior lecturer.
In her email to The Crimson, Abramson wrote that she encourages her students in her journalism classes to apply the “highest standards” to their work.
“These include getting the facts, digging for the truth, transparency with sources and readers and, of course, accuracy,” she wrote. “When mistakes happen, it’s important to own them and correct them immediately.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It was the luckiest shot of my career,” said Bryce Aiken.
Every so often, an individual performance dazzles and stuns an audience, leading a team to victory seemingly beyond all obstacles. On Friday night, Aiken’s 44-point performance, one of the most incredible efforts seen in Harvard history, helped the Crimson cling to a 98-96 victory over Columbia in 3OT, in one of the greatest games ever played at Lavietes Pavilion.
“There is something to say about having the will just to keeping fighting and the will to win,” said Coach Tommy Amaker, on a game that was so compelling that it led the 11:00pm edition of ESPN’s Friday night SportsCenter. “It was just a sensational performance certainly by Aiken at the start. He put us on his back and carried us to the finish line.”
Columbia all but had it at the tail end of the first overtime, too. After sprinting out to a 77-71 lead with fewer than 50 seconds remaining, the Crimson (11-7, 4-1 Ivy) pulled off an incredible rally back to extend the contest for five more minutes. Accurate free throw shooting left Harvard down three with 4.3 seconds left. Aiken paced the ball up the court, as the Lions tried to foul intentionally, and was met by towering 6-foot-10 Lions junior Patrick Tapé. With only 1.6 seconds left, Aiken desperately heaved an off-balance, double-clutch shot and miraculously, it swished in as the buzzer sounded, to send the game to double overtime.
Double overtime once again came down to the wire, with the Crimson up three heading into the final 27 seconds. However, Columbia (6-13, 1-4) was not ready to throw in the towel. Junior guard Jake Killingsworth knocked down a triple of his own to even the contest at 89-89. Aiken had the ball in his hands once again and held for the last shot, but his fadeaway jumper was no good.
When Columbia’s sophomore guard Gabe Stefanini drilled a fall-away triple at the buzzer in regulation to send the game to overtime, some might have felt the momentum was with the Lions. But a charged Crimson bench showed no signs of nerves, clapping their hands, expecting the next five minutes to determine the winner — it turns out, it would take 15.
Harvard’s triple-overtime victory was the first contest to enter a third extra period since a 2009 victory over William and Mary. The game featured an astonishing 16 lead changes, and came down to the very last seconds of triple overtime. Aiken drilled two free throws, part of a 16-of-18 effort from the line, to give the Crimson a three-point lead.
Stefanini had one more chance to tie the contest with a triple, but was met by the extended reach of junior forward Rob Baker — who swiftly denied his attempt from the corner. However, the game was not over, just yet. Columbia recovered the ball in the waning seconds and it landed in the hands of the Lions’ Quinton Adlesh. There was just 0.5 ticks left on the clock, but Adlesh was fouled in the act of shooting a three by Christian Juzang. With the Lavietes crowd roaring, on its feet, Adlesh front-rimmed the first free-throw, all but sealing the victory for Harvard. 
The Crimson defense clamped down during the final few minutes, holding the Lions to a field-goal-less final 3:12 of the game. The final buzzer left players and coaches alike shaking their heads, in disbelief over the 55-minute marathon that was finally complete.
“This was the definitely one of the best games I’ve ever been a part of or seen,” said Justin Bassey. “Just got to enjoy it, enjoy the moment and everything that comes with it.”
Bassey, who finished with 10 boards — only two fewer than team leader Baker — had a critical inbounds save in that final overtime frame. Juzang rimmed out on a three-point attempt with the Crimson clinging to a 96-95 lead, and the ball sailed towards the out-of-bounds line at the corner. But the Denver, Colo., native rushed towards the bench and recovered the ball — in an incredible show of hustle — shepherding it into the hands of Aiken for two critical free throws.
“[Bassey] definitely had the biggest rebound of the game at the end,” Aiken said. “After the missed shot, that [rebound] was ridiculous. We needed it.”
Aiken’s 44 points were one shy of a program-record 45 point performance by Brady Merchant, in a 2003 victory over Brown. The junior guard’s jaw-dropping individual performance included 12-of-28 from the field, in an extremely taxing 46 minutes. It felt only appropriate that Aiken would be the hero, more than a year after the game against Columbia that forced him to miss the better part of a year. Aiken left the game gimpy multiple times, and was seen with a bloody knee - but refused to allow his injuries to be a storyline.
“Nah, I wasn’t [in pain], I was just cramping,” Aiken said. “ Hopefully I can recover fast enough. You don’t go into these weekends thinking you are going to play a triple overtime game. So, we’ll see.”
Friday night’s game, in many respects, boiled down to Aiken versus Stefanini and Adlesh. Stefanini, a sophomore guard, knocked down 10-of-25 field goals for 26 points, while Adlesh scored 24 points of his own in a yeoman-like 52 minutes. Despite Aiken’s second-highest point total in program history, the two Lions’ guards thrived on the visitors’ system of cuts, curls, and motion offense, and were able to keep Columbia in the game and weather several Harvard runs.
“We didn’t switch enough, again Adlesh and Stefanini getting downhill, getting by us.” Amaker said. “We were just a step late for whatever reason, we didn’t communicate enough on ball screens.”
Stefanini’s performance was particularly noteworthy. In the first overtime session, the Bologna, Italy native found himself over 30 feet from the basket, with the shot-clock under three seconds. Stefanini heaved a deep triple, that banked home, giving the Lions a six point lead with just over a minute left in overtime, making the game look out of reach for the Crimson. At the time, Harvard had lower than 10 percent chance of winning, according to ESPN’s Win Probability model.
“Those two guards [Stefanini and Adlesh] were great off the ball, on the ball, and making difficult shots all game,” Aiken said. “Just keeping the pressure on us. So I think them, their energy, and the way they played really made a difference tonight. Luckily we were able to overcome that.”
Friday’s wild victory took place in front of a duo of familiar faces for the Crimson. Columbia’s assistant coach, Kenny Blakeney, a former assistant for Amaker and the Crimson, returned to Cambridge opposing Harvard. Andre Chatfield, who graduated from the College and the basketball team last season, was also in the crowd on Friday night.
“Just all the guys 1-20 are just ecstatic,” Bassey said. “Everyone is extremely happy and energetic. Just got to enjoy it and everything that comes with it. Then Coach comes in, and making sure that we’re ready to turn the page. We got a back-to-back game tomorrow [against Cornell].”
Although a date with the Big Red looms in fewer than 24 hours, the Crimson will undoubtedly have an opportunity to process the miraculous effort of Aiken and his supporting cast on Friday night. In a league that’s supposedly won on Saturdays, Harvard put forth its bid for the most compelling game of the 2018-2019 college basketball season, on a marathon of a Friday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Where do I even begin?
To encapsulate a game so heart-throbbing, so unimaginable, so exhilarating in a few words? That is simply impossible. You have to have been at Lavietes Pavilion in the flesh on Friday, February 8th to understand truly how incredible a game that was.
For those folks who received texts around 9PM, saw the madness on Twitter, or somehow was watching television when the Crimson headlined SportsCenter at 11PM (or later ESPN’s Top Play of the Night), I will do my best to contextualize this wild experience.
Before I get to the fact that this game went into three overtimes (yes, three), let me also throw in that Bryce Aiken put up 44 points — just one shy of a program record — Friday night. Quite literally, this game (which may have seemed rather humdrum at first glance) would stand on the brink of the history books by the sound of the final buzzer. And yes, the buzzer did finally sound after what appeared was turning into a midnight matinee with no end in sight.
It wasn’t just the fact that fans were treated to 15 minutes of free basketball. Let me remind you that it took two unbelievable three-point heaves and a bevy of more jaw-dropping moments for fans to see this one to the end, with a few more gray hairs and potentially a heart examination in sight.
The first buzzer-beater came from the fingertips of a Columbia Lion, second-year Gabe Stefanini, to send it into overtime. Yes, the fadeaway triple over Aiken’s outstretched arms was impressive, but could the underdog Columbia team that held in check to the Crimson truly pull this one off?
It sure appeared so. The Lions roared out of extra time with a three, lay-up, and another three, and the Crimson slumped to a six-point deficit with less than two minutes left. Amidst the dejected energy in the crowd though, a few Harvard bench players clapped their hands and gave a look of confidence in that ensuing timeout.
The Crimson would need every bit of that positive energy, and frankly, some luck out of a magician’s hat. Down three and having four seconds-and-change to score from the opposing baseline, Aiken was stopped in his tracks still far away from the three-point arc. Stuck in the air, the point guard had to double-clutch and somehow mustered enough force to get that ball in the air.
Let’s be honest. The way that ball was released, I for one thought it had no chance. I’m sure most of the 1,636 in attendance thought the same.
But how on earth did that orange leather ball go in? It seemingly defied physics.
At that moment, it appeared as if the gods decided to take off their light-blue and put on some crimson-red to rescue the home side. But only temporarily.
The second overtime finish saw Lions guard Jake Killingsworth drain a corner three(why anything else?) to once again force another five minutes of play.
At that point, the emotions in Lavietes Pavilion were a mix of confusion, shock, excitement, and must I say, apprehension? In the rush of human emotions from polar opposite ends of the affective spectrum, this quickly turned into a war of attrition for both sides. Players on both teams were approaching minute totals in the forties, and the exhaustion of tired bodies could be vicariously felt even in the upper rows.
The crowd though, persisted in keeping a Lavietes Pavilion not accustomed to such “late-night” madness alive. You could feel the seats shake on each Columbia free throw. A rather dormant crowd in the regular two halves of play finally awoke. I think Bryce even earned a few “MVP” chants.
The last overtime felt more like a blur, as many were readying themselves emotionally for yet another five minutes. But a nice hustle play by junior guard Justin Bassey off a missed three, a dagger-like corner triple from freshman Noah Kirkwood, and a bizarre ending that involved an ill-advised foul in the final second of play followed by a missed free throw at last allowed those at Lavietes Pavilion to exhale.
Exhale and still be shell-shocked by the whole bonanza. I still am, for sure.
The funny thing about it all? There’s another game tonight against the Big Red.
This is why I love Ivy League basketball.
