What makes a good horror movie? One might say that a good horror movie is one that emphasizes the presentation of the grotesque. This answer could be called the grindhouse approach, and it has produced many well-regarded horror franchises—“Saw” and “Friday the 13th” come to mind. The 1976 Brian De Palma adaptation of a Stephen King novel “Carrie” falls firmly into this category.  “Carrie” was not a particularly well-made film—the cinematography is poor to middling and the screenplay is unconvincing—but nevertheless is considered a classic of the horror genre. Sissy Spacek leads as the eponymous persecuted, telekinesis-endowed teenager, now a cultural icon in her blood-soaked prom dress.
However, there is an alternate approach to making horror films, one that, while often still using much violence and grotesquery, relies primarily on intellectual horror. Such films, notably “The Silence of the Lambs,” tend to be much more coherent thematically and formally, and thus they tend to resonate much more deeply than simple gore-fests. Kimberly Peirce’s remake of “Carrie,” starring Chloë Grace Moretz, aspires to be this sort of horror film, and although imperfect, it meets with much success.
The tenor of the new “Carrie,” and its differences from the old, are captured in the first sequence. De Palma has a brief gym volleyball game followed by a five-minute slow-motion girls’ locker room scene, which is nothing but an incredibly uncomfortable piece of 1970s erotica. Peirce instead has a tightly framed, deliberate scene in which Margaret White (Julianne Moore) gives birth to the Carrie. Margaret, crouched murderously above her child with a pair of scissors, provides a striking tableau that calls to mind Francisco Goya’s late paintings of parental malevolence. Pierce’s introduction immediately and intentionally emphasizes the horror and perversity of the story, while also providing the deeply resonant and memorable motif of child sacrifice to which the film can return. On the other hand, while De Palma’s sequence is also disturbing, it is unclear if this is intentional or just the byproduct of the objective tastelessness of somebody wandering around filming nude scenes in high school girls’ locker rooms.
This increased thoughtfulness in writing is also evident in the treatment of Carrie as a character. De Palma’s Carrie is a monster. While she may inspire pity and horror in the viewer, she does not inspire empathy—she has a vapid personality, reacting without subtlety to external stimuli. Peirce and screenwriters Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and Lawrence D. Cohen, on the other hand, presents a Carrie with much more pluck, standing up to her mother not out of blind reaction but out of well-formed, intelligent opposition. In the scene in which Margaret attributes her daughter’s first period to libidinous thoughts, the new Carrie protests “That’s not even in the Bible!” while the old Carrie just voices inarticulate rejection. The new Carrie is one with whom we can sympathize, a fact that makes her murderous rampage in the film’s climax all the more terrible to see, and all the more enjoyable and cathartic. She is not so much an angered monster as an avenging fury.
At the same time, in this program of revision, Peirce modernizes some aspects of the story. Carrie’s humiliation at the hands of the other girls in her gym class is filmed on an iPhone and posted to YouTube. Carrie searches through her school library on a digital catalogue. The uncomfortable prom rituals of the 1970s are replaced by the uncomfortable prom rituals of the 2010s. Nevertheless, the remake generally stays true to the story of the original, even retaining much of the original dialogue.
In spite of Pierce’s generally more artful treatment, there are flaws in the new “Carrie.” In the final scenes, the dialogue becomes increasingly heavy-handed and melodramatic, with such trite, hackneyed lines as “I have been hurt my whole life.” Special effects, especially for Carrie’s telekinetic actions, are somewhat overused and a touch too slick. “CSI”-style slow-motion sequences depicting the deaths of characters are dissonant with the film’s overall aesthetic. Nevertheless, these faults are relatively minor compared to the work’s general elegance.
Ultimately, however, one must return to the question above: what makes a good horror film? The new “Carrie” does not necessarily inspire the same visceral disgust that the old “Carrie” does, and indeed, one might argue that it tends more towards tragic fantasy than true horror. Peirce, however, has made a much more intelligent and ambitious film, and thus may be said to have bettered De Palma in some way. It is the individual’s standard of horror that will determine the relative success of each. That said, it may be taken as an encouraging occurrence that, in the era of Michael Bay, one major film has opted for a subtle approach, even in that most unsubtle of genres, horror.

A night of fake mustaches, cross-dressing, revenge, French accents, and staged deaths ensued at Adams Pool Theatre in Mark Twain’s play “Is He Dead?” which ran through Sunday. With clever staging by director Olivia M. Munk ’16 and hilarious acting, the production was intriguing and funny, perfectly executing Twain’s witty script.
Though originally written in 1898, “Is He Dead?” did not gain prominence until its first performance in 2007, only a few years after playwright David Ives adapted and published the script. The story begins in 19th-century France as Jean-Francois Millet (Dylan J. Peterson ’17), an impoverished and unsuccessful painter, is struggling to sell his artwork. Bastein Andre (Tom M. Keefe ’15), an art dealer and also his nemesis, demands that either Millet pay back his debt in  money or give his lover (Brooke E. Sweeney ’17) to Andre in marriage. In an effort to resolve the debt, Millet and his partners in crime, Agamemnon “Chicago” Buckner (Eli B. Schleicher ’17), Hans “Dutchy” von Bismarck (Julia E. Canick ’17), and Phelim O’Shaughnessy (Colin A. Mark ’17) plan an elaborate plot to fake Millet’s death in order to make a sale to a painter who claims he will never buy from a living artist.
During the period of Millet’s supposed illness and death, he disguises himself as “the widow” Daisy Tillou, his fictional twin, complete with fake breasts, a bright pink dress, and a blonde wig. Peterson’s performance as the widow was spot-on; his movements were painfully self-aware as he shifted to hide his hairy legs, sat gracefully down on the couch, and attempted to talk delicately “like a lady.” His appearance as a woman was clearly awkward but added humor to the already jocular lines.
Julius G. B. Ross ’17 also gave a stellar performance, switching between four different characters, including Basil Thorpe, who buys Millet’s “posthumous” paintings for 100,000 francs; Charlie, the widow’s servant; and the King of France, who makes a dramatic and hilarious appearance at the end. Ross’s versatility in acting was wonderful as he repeatedly came on and off the stage as different characters, impressively donning new accents and costumes.
The fact that the production did not take itself too seriously made it all the more captivating. The acting was fiery, witty, and hilarious, from Mark’s purposefully over-the-top performance as Phelim to Keefe’s exaggerated French accent as Andre. The characters also frequently broke the fourth wall; when interjecting funny comments, a blazing spotlight emphasized the change. At other moments, light design by Joey R. Longstreet ’16 complemented the tone, with bright lights accompanying the cast’s loud and energetic performances and occasional dim illumination of the few serious scenes.
The set, designed by Renee E. Zhan ’16, was simple and whimsical, complete with just a paint-splattered couch, fresh flowers and a vase, a wine bottle, and a backdrop with Millet’s paintings. The small scale of the stage and the commonplace props gave a cozy feel to the production.
“Is He Dead?” was a high-energy and light-hearted production that perfectly captured Twain’s tale of 19th-century France. The production’s success can be attributed largely to the talent of the actors; their believability and hilarity was the pinnacle of the play, even with all the bright costumes, affected accents, and gender mix-ups on stage.

In the introductory sequence of Christian Vincent’s “Haute Cuisine” (titled “Les Saveurs du Palais” for its French release), an Australian television crew floats towards an Antarctic exploration station to film a documentary. The viewers do not know why this station is particularly worthy of documenting, and they have little reason to care very much. Indeed, this sequence encapsulates the whole film. The viewers drift along through some beautiful landscapes, but ultimately are given little sense of purpose on their journey and leave it as untouched as when they entered the theater. 
Vincent is a man who makes unremarkable films (witness the bland romantic drama “La Séparation”), and this most recent effort, which captures the travails of the former personal chef of French president François Mitterrand, does not inspire confidence that he will overcome this mediocrity. Nevertheless, he exhibits a determination to continue it with as much preciosity as possible. Like the tremendously overrated “Before Midnight,” released earlier this summer, “Haute Cuisine” aspires to an independent art-film aesthetic, full of light touches with profound reverberations about life, the universe, and everything, but succeeds only in being annoying.
 The vacuity of the plot is the first and greatest sticking point, and it is aggravated by the self-indulgent affection modern filmmakers have for nonlinear narratives. Upon the revelation that the Antarctic station’s cook was once chef for the French President, the film leaps back four years to Perigord, France in a sequence that affords some truly lovely aerial views of the forests of Aquitaine. Hortense (Catherine Frot) is hurried from her home to the Palace Elysée to be the new private chef for François Mitterand. Her struggles with the main kitchen and French bureaucrats are as predictable as her meeting with the president (Jean d’Ormesson). The remainder of the film concerns itself with her tribulations during her two years in the president’s service. Her insipid struggles with dieticians and financial officers are occasionally punctuated with poorly integrated but beautifully filmed sequences of Antarctica, lest one forget the clunky, unnecessary frame story.
 In this respect, “Haute Cuisine” illustrates a general truth about its genre: the action in films about servants tends to be dull. This fact is the reason that such films must have powerful character development, à la “The Remains of the Day”; otherwise, viewers are just left watching people do tedious things, which is usually what they are trying to avoid by going to the movies. “Haute Cuisine” fails to exhibit such strong character development, and so it becomes a film journal of a pleasant but not especially engaging woman doing not especially engaging things. The writers, perhaps sensing this, occasionally try to introduce conflict with various sorts of artifices, including a presidential trip to North Africa, low-fat dieting restrictions, and a stress fracture that is introduced in one scene and not mentioned for the rest of the film. Ultimately, all these efforts to jump-start audience engagement are dead ends, and viewers are left with little reason to care about Hortense’s desperate fish run to the market any more than they care about a roommate’s desperate milk run to CVS. 
 It must be granted that some of the cinematography for “Haute Cuisine” is strikingly beautiful, like many of this new breed of would-be art films. Shots of the food are particularly well framed and balanced, with great attention to lighting and color. Unfortunately, this command of the medium slips a bit during dialogues—it appears that Vincent can frame a steamed cabbage properly, but not the face of the President of France. Annoying as this flaw is, it is not so pervasive as to drive the viewer to distraction. Despite its faults, the cinematography is by far the best aspect of the movie.
 Nevertheless, beautiful camera work cannot overcome fundamental mediocrity of content. “Haute Cuisine,” even if it is dull with beautiful visuals, is still dull. If you are one of the select few whose attention is held rapt by well-lit pictures of fruit tarts, this movie was made for you; otherwise, your time is best spent elsewhere.

“The Bacchae” is one of Euripides’ most enduringly resonant tragedies, centered on the misfortunes of the house of Cadmus that flow from its denial of the god Dionysus. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s rendition is an otherwise good production that is marred by one severe, baffling directorial error and one poor performance. The difficulties concomitant with modern stagings of Greek tragedies are manifold. Beyond the very critical problem of the lack of knowledge about Greek in the general public, there lies a host of other issues: the fact that no performance manuals or stage instructions exist from the classical period, the loss of the music and choreography that accompanied the plays, and the general darkness that enshrouds our understanding of the stage and scenery all compound the fact that most audiences are either overexposed to and bored with the subjects (witness Sophocles’ “Oedipus Rex”) or totally unfamiliar with them (witness Euripides’ “Iphigenia”).
In this production, directed by Anna A. Hagen ’15 and running through Saturday, such problems are largely minimized. “The Bacchae,” although it does not have a particularly well-known plot, at least has a well-known main character, the god Dionysus. David Greig’s generally elegant and faithful translation strikes a good balance between poetic expression and intelligibility. The minimalistic, Beckett-esque staging by set designer Larkin P. D. McCann ’15, supported by excellent lighting decisions on the part of light designers Anna G. Kelsey ’14 and Gabrielle M. Walti ’14, brings focus to the action and avoids all the thorny problems associated with complex scenery: a lone tree, four chairs, and a cluster of candles are the only representation given of the environs of Thebes. There are a few touches of directorial brilliance: during the lyric odes, the Bacchae, performers that represent the Greek chorus, perform stomp routines, choreographed by Mariel N. Pettee ’14, which is a superb method for capturing the spirit and energy of the lost choral dances of the Greek original. Their ritualistic wands are replaced symbolically by stiletto heels, an equally potent if more subtle sexual symbol in modern eyes. Blocking decisions are likewise elegant, maximizing the effectiveness of the choreography and preserving a balanced tension between characters during dialogue. In short, Hagen shows a masterful control over the physical aspects of the play.
This fact is marred by the clumsy decision to alter the content of the play itself, namely by changing Dionysus’ sex from male to female. This choice is, in itself, confusing: Euripides’ Dionysus is gender-bending enough in his original configuration—the play is fraught with frequent allusions to the god’s effeminate beauty, and the subtle, homoerotic tension between the god and the unbelieving Theban prince Pentheus is one of the sources from which the play derives much of its power. Indeed, having a woman play the androgynous male god would be a directorial coup; however, changing the character’s sex itself is unnecessary and confusing.
Nevertheless, something could perhaps have been brought out of this decision if the script had not been so dissonantly and crudely altered. In spite of the fact that the god’s pronoun is changed throughout and “man” is changed to “woman” where necessary, a number of glaring oversights remain, notably a choral hymn addressed to “Lord Dionysus,” an honorific that never refers to a woman, and Pentheus’s line about the god being “effeminate.” Calling a woman “effeminate” makes as much sense as calling a man “mannish.” On the other hand, calling a man “effeminate” invokes associations in the listener’s mind that are not so obvious and thus of richer significance. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that she has been given a role that makes no sense, the performance by Rachel A. Gibian ’15 is very competent: her diction is clear and she generally emotes without dipping into melodrama.
The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for James M. Graham ’17, who plays the doomed prince Pentheus. His lines are delivered with such choking emotion that they are occasionally difficult to understand. This Pentheus appears to have two settings, namely “evil” and “really evil.” There is no subtlety in the performance, but much clenching of the jaw and tightening of muscles in what appears to be an effort physically to squeeze evil out of every pore. As annoying as all this straining is, its effects on the play as a whole are minimized by excellent support from the other actors.
All told, this is a good production with some inspired aspects; however, its flaws prevent it from being a great production. While the physical qualities of the play do so much to capture the spirit of Greek tragedy, the alterations to its content show a fundamental misunderstanding of its nature.

For those who still associate Katy Perry with blue wigs, whipped-cream bras and dresses made out of cupcakes, her new album may be a game-changer. The gregarious pop queen reveals an unexpected sincerity and vulnerability in “Prism.” From the mellow “By The Grace of the God,” in which she addresses her struggles with suicidal thoughts, to “This Moment,” a powerful ballad that implores the listeners to live in the moment, her new album serves as an affecting message of resilience. Mostly gone are the formulaic, sugar-coated pop songs about puppy-love that brought Perry worldwide fame in her last album, “Teenage Dream.” Perry does revert back to her old self in couple of tracks, such as “This Is How We Do,” a strange contrast to the sincere tone of the album. Yet despite these incongruities, “Prism” effectively presents itself as a bold statement of empowerment, a lust for life even with the pain.
One of the major ways that Perry drastically changes in this album is through her blunt, honest lyrics. Her lyrics are sincere in that they reveal her personal crises: she addresses her failed marriage with Russell Brand and the consequent pain and recovery. In “By The Grace of God,” Perry viscerally takes the listener through her contemplation of suicide: “Laying on the bathroom floor / We were living on a fault line / and I felt the fault was all mine.” Similarly, in “Ghost,” Perry alludes to how Brand texted her for a divorce: “Yeah, we were burning our lives / With every kiss, and every letter / Every promise of forever, oh / But you hit send / And disappeared in front of my eyes.” Through the lyrics’ brutal honesty, “Prism” becomes commanding and dramatic.
As much as “Prism” addresses pain, Perry’s wish to move on rings clearly in the upbeat tune and rhythm used in conjunction to her empowering statements. Although the instrumentation is limited to shimmering synths during the sorrowful moments on “Ghost” a driving, upbeat rhythm takes over as Perry screams, “I’ll be alright / It doesn’t haunt me at night.” Similarly, “Unconditionally,” starts out mellow with syncopated rhythm, only for a rising synthesizer to take over at the same time as Perry’s realization: “Acceptance is the key to be / To be truly free.” The manipulation between mellow, minimal instrumentation and a strong, upbeat sound heightens the lyrical message of self-empowerment. The heart of this album is the theme of resilience through the pain.
But “Prism” goes beyond addressing the change in Perry’s personal life—she also explores genres outside of pop, ranging from electronica to plaintive, subdued ballads. “Legendary Lovers” is a perfect mix of bhangra-inspired rhythms and pop hooks. Perry also introduces electronica in “Choose Your Battles” with steady synthesizer beats. Perry even offers up a bubbly rap for a segment of the song. An unexpected change from the uplifting, energetic pop songs, “By The Grace of God” is a mellow piano ballad, perhaps a genre that befits its somber topic. By borrowing and injecting elements from other genre, Perry seems to ponder not only her personal development, but also the direction of her musical career.
Yet a couple of the tracks, such as “International Smile,” “This is How We Do,” and “Birthday,” seem like random additions to the album, almost as if Perry wasn’t fully ready to leave her pop roots. They are largely mediocre and underwhelming, both in their generic music and vague lyrics. “Birthday” especially is a formulaic pop song with its electric guitar, conventional rhythm, single tonality, and drums and bass for instrumentation. Even Perry’s voice seems to be overly digitalized. Its lyrics are equally banal: “I know you like it sweet / So you can have your cake / Give you something good to celebrate.” These songs seem less like representation of the old Katy Perry than like generic, overly processed pop songs. They detract from Perry’s maturation as an artist and her pain carefully articulated in the rest of the album.
Altogether, “Prism” is an appealing album in that the forthright lyrics unexpectedly reveal Perry’s vulnerability while signifying a maturation in Perry’s musical career—a pop princess carefully incorporating new genres. The album imparts empowerment, as in its anthem “By the Grace of God”: “Thought I wasn’t enough / Found I wasn’t so tough…I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay.”

A palpable sobriety filled the air as Boston Book Festival founder Deborah Porter kicked off this year’s festival with a somber speech. The subdued tone was not without reason; Thursday night’s opening event, a panel discussion entitled “Writing Terror: An Exploration of Fear,” had a special relevance to its audience in the wake of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, a tragedy that occurred just four blocks from the Back Bay Events Center where the discussion took place. “We share the feeling of being terrorized and horrified that day and the days that followed,” Porter told the audience.
Once the panel began, however, the mood lightened. Laughter filled the hall several times as Time magazine columnist Joe Klein moderated a discussion with a diverse quartet of terror and terrorism experts. Valerie Plame Wilson, a former CIA operative, and Mary Louise Kelly, who covered the NPR intelligence beat, recently released novels based on their experiences; Jessica Stern, a fellow at Harvard’s FXB Center for Health and Human Rights, is an American policy consultant on terrorism who has written a successful memoir about her own experiences being terrorized. Rounding out the group was horror filmmaker Wes Craven, who, as Klein said, has “scared the crap out of us” for decades. The Boston bombing and other weighty current events were brought up throughout the talk, but they never dragged down the conversation, which remained focused on the panelists’ work even as it hit on broader issues.
In their discussion of current global affairs, the panelists showed a range of concerns. Kelly, referring to intelligence officer interviews from her NPR career, spoke of the threat of nuclear terrorism with particular emphasis on Pakistan. “U.S. intelligence divides the…nuclear threat into Pakistan and the rest of the world,” she said. “That’s how scared the U.S. is.”
Wilson agreed on the magnitude of the Pakistan threat, saying that the country’s government and intelligence service have been infiltrated deeply by those with anti-U.S. sentiment. “It really is a nation-state that is imploding,” she said, adding that a nuclear threat is more imminent than skeptical Americans might think: “We have just gotten lucky in the five decades since the dawn of the atomic age.”
Craven, the panelist with the fewest ties to the American government, revealed his trepidation concerning the nation’s secrecy. “My fear is that we’ve lost our way,” he said. The creator of slasher icons such as Freddy Krueger and the “Scream” killer also showed a passion for environmental issues, expressing worry about continued government inaction towards global warming. “So many brilliant people are…practically weeping for us to listen, and nobody’s listening,” he said.
The panelists also explained how they transfer these real-life terror issues into their creative work. “I decided to subscribe to the ‘go big or go home’ school of thriller writing,” Kelly said of her novel, a thriller called “Anonymous Sources.” “My protagonist is going to be up against the worst thing you can possibly imagine.” For Kelly, the threat of nuclear war may be terrifying, but she used this sense of imminent danger to aid her book, which features a female journalist up against a Pakistani terror cell.
In her own thriller “Blowback,” Wilson attempted to capture the essence of CIA procedures in perfectly accurate detail. The villain of the book was based on an actual Pakistani nuclear scientist, and Wilson went through painstaking effort to make sure the “tradecraft,” or actual spy work, was portrayed accurately. “There’s a lot of eye-rolling, typically, watching TV,” she said, referring to CIA series such as Showtime’s “Homeland” as “not realistic.”
Yet for some, reconciling personal experience with work has not been so easy. Stern, who has worked under the Clinton administration as one of the world’s leading terror experts, spent years denying that her fascination with terror was related to an incident of sexual assault she experienced in her youth. “I had post-traumatic stress disorder,” she said. “I was diagnosed with it and I didn’t believe it.” Her book, “Denial: A Memoir of Terror,” was released in 2010 and chronicles the event itself and her thoughts in the aftermath. Ultimately, writing about the experience was cathartic for Stern, and it gave her a chance to connect with fellow sufferers. “Since the book has come out a number of the victims have come forward to me,” she said.
For Kelly, this discrepancy between personal and professional life takes a different form. When asked by an audience member her opinion on Edward Snowden’s divulging of classified NSA information, her answer was decidedly mixed. “Speaking personally, I think what he did was wrong; what he did was illegal,” she said. “As a reporter, it’s opened up a terrific amount of information that we’ve not had access to and sparked an international debate…that we would not have had otherwise.”
During much of the discourse, Craven leaned back in his chair and at one point remarked, “I feel like I’m here to be comic relief.” Yet he spoke seriously of his work and the art of crafting an effective horror villain. “The ones you remember, it’s because they’re complex,” he said. More specifically, he added, the best horror villains are like real-life terrorists, perceived as evil yet with enough humanity to arouse a discomforting pity. “[We] don’t like to think…that [terrorists] think they’re doing what they must to protect their country or their culture,” the director said. “It’s scary to think about that.”

"All That Matters"
Justin Bieber, album untitled
With no falsetto, no breathy rapping, and no life-or-death, “as long as you love me” melodrama, fans of J. Biebs may be a little shocked by his newest effort. ”All That Matters” begins with a few slick chords on guitar and maintains this coolness throughout. Given his public antics and questionable fashion choices, Bieber demonstrates a remarkable amount of maturity on this track. The beats are slow and deliberate, his voice controlled and—dare I say it?—adult, as he achieves several deeper notes never before heard from the former child pop star. “All That Matters” marks a departure from J. Bieb’s pop roots and explores a softer, subtler, more R&B-esque side of the now 19 year-old singer. It’s certainly not the best single of the year, but it’s surprisingly listenable. “All That Matters,” with its smooth vocals and mellow vibe, is a sign that Bieber may actually have potential for musical success as an adult.
 
"Rap God"
Eminen, "Marshall Mathers LP 2"
On the heels of “Survival” and “Berzerk,” the first two singles off his latest album “The Marshall Mathers LP 2,” “Rap God” sees Eminem exploring new territory, as he spits rhymes backed by a throbbing house beat. The raps are typical Eminem, self-congratulatory and bombastic—he’s proclaiming himself a “rap god,” after all—but the beat seems more in line with today’s popular club anthems than with his past successes. This change in form, however, doesn’t make “Rap God” feel fresh. Rather, the background is grating and the lyrics uninteresting. Eminem’s speed, wit, and ability to rhyme are readily apparent make his talent in the beginning. But after five more minutes of the song, there still isn’t another takeaway. “Rap God” fits in Eminem’s repertoire as a mediocre entry: a decent rap, but not his most catchy, not his best demonstration of skill, and certainly not on the level of his classics.
"Old School Love ft. Ed Sheeran"
Lupe Fiasco, Tetsuo & Youth 
 Rapper Lupe Fiasco and British crooner Ed Sheeran may seem like an unlikely pair, but their partnership works well in this latest track, as they play to one another’s strengths. Sheeran, whose breathy voice has been behind several small hits in the past year, provides a soothing chorus, perfect for a song predicated on nostalgia. Fiasco, for his part, adds sharp rhymes to a striking piano background and a strong beat. The overall effect is an upbeat synthesis of genres that deserves significant airplay. It’s not an anthem, but it’s certainly a fun tune that should get attention. Take note: it’s highly likely that this song will be everywhere in the next couple of weeks.

“You mean the body paint?” said pianist Yuja Wang, looking up at a projected image of her latest album cover. She was joking about the skintight dress she’s wearing in the photo, and at the same time referencing something unique to her as a performer—her sense of style. The virtuosic 26-year-old pianist’s bold fashion choices have inspired much commentary over the years, but what she’s really doing is staying true to her own sensibilities, which has proven quite successful when it comes to her piano playing. Beyond that, too, Wang’s dress and her comments about it speak to a truth at the core of classical music that is often overlooked: the music is about enjoying yourself.
On Friday, Wang appeared at Harvard in a spirited discussion in the Kirkland Junior Common Room co-organized by Harvard College Piano Society and the Office for the Arts’ Learning From Performers program, with support from the Celebrity Series of Boston. Piano Society co-president George C. Ko ’15 held a lively conversation with Wang about her career and her creative process. Wang is an internationally acclaimed pianist who has received numerous distinctions, including performing at Carnegie Hall in 2011, and has performed with many renowned orchestras, including those of Boston, Chicago, and New York, as well as the China Philharmonic, Orchestre de Paris, and Orquesta Nacional España. Wang, who began playing piano when she was six years old, is also the recipient of numerous competitive music prizes prizes. Her fame broadened to a new audience in 2008 when she became a YouTube sensation with a virtuosic performance of “Flight of the Bumblebee,” which stunned both with its technical prowess and its musicality and has since been watched millions of times.  It would be unfair to define her in terms of a piece so designed to technically impress, though—Wang is distinguished from other pianists by her lively playing style. “Whenever she plays, she’s got a lot of energy,” says Jack Test, who attended Wang’s talk. During the talk, Wang discussed a variety of topics, including her musical education and her relationships with different musicians and teachers. Wang brings much more than her musical prowess to the table; she carries herself with an unbridled enthusiasm and good humor that is special to find in any discipline. Wang found something fun in every question asked of her in Friday’s discussion.“It’s fast,” Wang said jokingly as the audience watched a video of a performance with conductor Gustavo Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra. Wang also laughingly discussed the advantages of introducing alcohol into her practice time. “I can say ‘if it’s a wrong note, it’s not me, it’s the vodka’,” she said.
She also mentioned the experience of recording her latest record and the relationship between virtuosity and musical realization. Wang’s words on her latest record, a performance of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 3 and Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No. 2 with Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela, provided the audience with an entertaining view of the dynamics between two young classical superstars. Dudamel, age 32, is an accomplished Venezuelan conductor and violinist.  “It was amazing. Lots of testosterone, for sure,” Wang said of her performance with the orchestra. She went on to detail the ease of working with a conductor from her own young generation. “It was good, because we never even had a conductor meeting. Usually people talk through tempos and stuff, but we didn’t have to do that. We just let the music speak,” she said. Wang also is noted for her consistently unique and lively takes on established classics, and this is helped immensely by her devotion to exploring the score of a piece from her own point of view. “Pieces like Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev I’ve heard a lot before from seminars or being in a concert or touring, so you can’t really not know the pieces,” Wang says, “But in general I don’t listen to the recordings.” It’s quite evident in Wang’s performances that this is true—she makes every piece her own. This discussion was part of the Harvard College Piano Society’s mission  to encourage interest and excellence in the study of piano on campus. “What’s most important for us is to have a diversity of ideas and inspirations,” Ko says. He wants to provide examples for students of unconventional angles on classical music and to send the message that music is a personal thing to be accessed by everyone. “Music’s about having fun. It’s about expressing what you love. Classical music is no different from hip-hop or jazz. It’s all about expression.” The Piano Society’s aim is to shift the focus off of the demanding nature of classical music and onto the joy that comes from playing it. There are few people who could illustrate that more vividly than Yuja Wang.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Helen Lawlor works at the intersection of music and cultural heritage. An award-winning Celtic harpist, Lawlor is also a renowned scholar in the field of Irish musical culture and ethnomusicology. She currently lectures at the Dundalk Institute of Technology in addition to performing as a harpist in the university’s sinfonia. She will visit Harvard on Wednesday to present a lecture entitled “Religion, Revival, Recital: Perspectives on Irish Harping in the Twentieth Century” in the Forum Room of Lamont Library.
The Harvard Crimson:  How did your interest in the historical tradition of Irish music start?
Helen Lawlor:  When I was doing my master’s and thinking about research projects, I considered the harp tradition…. My own background of having been a traditional musician first and then having a conservatory model education allowed me to see the variety of forms from a practitioner’s point of view. I did a short master’s thesis on harping first, and that formed a basis for the proposal for a Ph.D.
THC:  How does the harp play into Irish history?
HL: The Irish harp has always been important culturally in Irish history. The triangular-shaped harp existed in Ireland as far back as the 10th century. In old Gaelic Irish society, the harper was a very important person in the court of the chieftains.… This was true until around the 17th century, when changing patterns and changing tastes in European music became more widespread. So in the 18th century the tradition was at a low ebb. In the 19th century the harp was revived and is now the official emblem of Ireland.
THC: What different styles of harping exist?
HL: There are three main styles: art music style, traditional music style and early Irish harping. The easy one to start with is the…early Irish harp. It’s a small wire-strung harp that’s played with long fingernails…totally different from the new Irish harp. It’s a revival of an old medieval instrument, and it’s similar in many ways to the early music movement in that it’s a revival of techniques…. The traditional music style was popularized in the late ’70s [and] early 1980s…and in this style the harp is treated in the same way as other mainstream traditional Irish instruments. Music [in this style] is passed down orally and is subjected to improvised variation and ornamentation. The bulk of the repertoire is traditional Irish dance music...but there is also a body of work of newly composed music for the harp.
THC: The harp is increasingly used in contemporary pop and alternative rock music. Do you see any Irish influences on this music?
HL: Yes. There is, however, difficulty with the Irish harp in that it’s semi-chromatic and can only produce one semi-tonal movement at a time on a string. In terms of specific Irish influence, there are some performers who have collaborated very successfully with pop and rock musicians. For example, Cormac de Barra is an Irish harpist who is touring New York and Boston with singer Hazel O’Connor. In the 20th century the harp was popularized in a number of ways, and the popularity has led to more diversity in musical experience.

He’s off on another brisk morning jog by the Charles. When he pauses to lie down in the grass, twigs and critters catch in his hair. He has a full set of straight teeth, absenting those ultimate molars. How fine to be young—virile, puerile, here for a while. Everything is exactly right for a second-year Harvard student with a heart full of love, healthy and clear-headed, stretching his legs on a Sunday antemeridian to feed Pringles to the geese. So why the funk? Do you still want to be a pre-med? He don’t like these questions—so he runs. Ah: runs. Riverrun past Leverett and Mather and Updike’s environs.
 
“It’s not good to listen to too much of Elliott Smith at once,” says the older brother over cell phone. “It can start to bring you down.” So maybe I’m just listening to too much sad music! Smith’s work is not the obvious accompaniment for those sporadic runs, but during sophomore year there was no artist to remotely rival his priority in my iTunes or on visits to Planet Records. His albums were suite background chatter and a full twenty percent of the memory on my first iPod, a device now lost to a fractured screen and the vast carelessness of a weekend in Cambridge.
 
Like most things, music touches us with impressions and instants. My impression after listening through Elliott’s oeuvre is despondency and nostalgia, nostalgia because this music recalls developmental days in Dover before the millennium when elder siblings played his album “XO” through the house. Then the instants: the moments of clarity in each song when the “little whisper smoke signs” of his voice bring a spooky lyric or casual expletive to contrast with a shiny, shimmering guitar chord. Or an epiphanic moment of your personal history, when in the first week or two of college you attend a screening of “Good Will Hunting” at the Science Center and recognize him in the soundtrack. At that moment what you really want is to tell Matt Damon to stop making lewd jokes so you can properly enjoy the song, “Between the Bars.”
 
Elliott went to school not far from here, at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA. After graduating in 1991 he did more than any of us could hope for with a liberal arts degree: moved back to Portland to build a name for the band he started with his classmate. “Heatmiser” found a label and released a few albums, earning its place in an historic decade for the City of Roses. Our protagonist soon found success with solo work on “Roman Candle” and a self-titled debut, followed as these things go by the dissonant dissolution of the old band. He famously met Gus Van Sant in Oregon and contributed a few songs to the dude’s movie; of these “Miss Misery” got nominated for an Oscar but lost to “My Heart Will Go On” in 1998.
 
Smith once commented that his songs are like “little movies”; furthermore, that when he writes music he likes to conceptualize it as shapes. The result is a harmony of stacked chords that create an “implied melody” and scenes built out of disjointed images with their own dark symbolism, for example “two tickets torn in half” or “spun glass in sore eyes.” There is an essential theme of fragmentation throughout his work that reflects an ongoing struggle with identity, with the sense of wholeness in relation to himself and his surroundings. So often his song is a nocturne with the speaker lost beneath the moon’s bare light bulb, strung out on a mesh of raw veins, the “maraña de vena reciente” from García Lorca’s poem “Ciudad Sin Sueño.” He ponders the cracks in the sidewalks, tries to assemble puzzle pieces, and struggles to pronounce some name that you keep repeating.
 
Maybe he just can’t express himself properly; too much “static in [his] head” amounting to a “beautiful confusion” that can only hint at some kind of trauma in his past. One might think of the “unspeakable things unspoken” that Toni Morrison created in her novel “Beloved.” One might also consider “Either/Or,” the 1843 Kierkegaard book after which Smith named his third album.  Here the Danish philosopher describes a type of being that is “jealous for itself aesthetically” and only finds completion with “the interposition of another”; finally, the artist puts his undergrad degree to some use. It’s all too tragic that Smith’s legacy should have so much to do with his long battle with alienation and addiction. We could do more to appreciate his prodigious talent as a musician and songwriter, more sensitive even to heartache than heroin. Yet as long as he can point to the peculiar relationship between “broken plans” and “broken plants,” his music will have a meaningful following and an additional aesthetic complement. Just look at the comments on his YouTube videos.
 
Sometimes things get broken up by the regular events of living. The unfathomable booty-twerking that shattered a window in the SOCH at the class of 2014’s First Chance Dance; the set from General Trotsky and the Confederates that rocked its blues-punk hard enough to fracture a pane in Holden Chapel during WHRB’s Battle of the Bands; the glassy stillness of the river broken by idiot kids on the traditional leap from Week’s Footbridge. Other things only seem broken, and you may battle in vain to find meaning or coherence when life ceases to be as straightforward as you expected. There’s no way to understand what happened when Smith evidently took his own life in late October 2003. But as the many people who find strength and resilience from his music will attest, there’s nothing trivial about your suffering—no matter its form—and you’re never alone.

Matching skinny jeans and sweaters in shades of pastel, long hair with sweeping bangs, copious amounts of eyeliner—to the average American consumer, these sound like characteristics of female singers. However, to the average South Korean consumer, these features are completely normal for male K-pop groups, if not endearing. Despite having witnessed the youthful, teen spirit vibes exuded in “What Makes You Beautiful” by One Direction or “Baby” by Justin Bieber,” if you showed the average American photos or videos of K-pop groups like SHINee, she would probably laugh and make fun of their soft or “effeminate” appearances. It seems that despite the widespread demand for appreciating individuals for their diversity, the U.S. remains torn and often hypocritical in its long-held views of ideal masculinities and portrayals of men in media—and these views seem to particularly manifest themselves with regard to foreign pop artists.
  In the book “Korean Masculinities and Transnational Consumption,” author Sun Jung discusses the idea of “hybridity” in K-pop culture. She explains that part of the exotic, otherworldly intrigue surrounding K-pop is its successful hybridization of stereotypical, Western masculinities (think Arnold Schwarzenegger in “The Terminator” or the male Abercrombie & Fitch models with washboard abs) and more culturally traditional Korean masculinities (men who hold to the Confucian ideals of exhibiting “a tender exterior and a strong inner will”—and the exploitation of these hybridizations. 
In present-day South Korea, K-pop “idols” are considered the epitome of masculine attractiveness, but they are portrayed in two incredibly different ways—either as “kkot mi nam” (literally translated to “flower boys” in reference to their cute, feminine appearances) or as “jim seung dols” (literally translated to “beast idols,” in reference to “beastly” masculinity). The “flower boys” dance to cutesy choreography and overemphasize their youthful innocence, as seen in Teen Top’s song, “Be Ma Girl.” However, these groups inevitably “grow up,” and their images transform to become more “tough” and “manly”—Teen Top’s latest hit illustrates this drastic shift in appearance.
“Beast idols” often draw upon elements of “gangster” and hip-hop aesthetics, such as the push-up dance choreography paired with dark, ripped-up clothing seen in “One Shot” by B.A.P. These performances emphasize images of stereotypical, tough, rough men and are closer to the ideal American understanding of what constitutes a real man. Groups like 2PM, BEAST, and B.A.P have wholeheartedly taken this approach. These groups perform songs with lyrics and concepts that seem over-the-top with their appropriations of tough masculinity, at times even performing completely shirtless or “fighting the system” in their music videos. Yet in public appearances, such as in TV shows or interviews, they show up with a softer demeanor: youthful, boyish hairstyles and bright, colorful clothing; copious amounts of BB cream to accentuate their fair, blemish-free complexions; and “circle lenses,” or heavy eyeliner, to highlight their eyes. Sometimes, they even cross-dress entirely or sport long, sleek hair and are confused for women completely.  
  In these ways, male K-pop idols are a long way from the macho men that the Western world seems to idolize. They walk a fine line between seeming more feminine and approachable on the outside, while exuding qualities of stereotypical “manly men” on the inside. For instance, consider artist Taecyeon of 2PM—he is expected to act “cutely” and “gentlemanly” on a faux-marriage television program, “We Got Married,” but likewise expected to sport a “chocolate ab” physique—in other words, a defined pair of six-pack abs—in order to be a “true” man. Thus, it seems K-pop male artists must not only perfect dance moves, fluid rap styles, or strong vocals, but also must perfect the art of gender performance.
  And then consider groups like Big Bang—one of the most lucrative groups in the current K-pop scene. In their trajectory into the K-pop industry, their songs and music video concepts have propagated images of being tough boys from the streets (case in point: “Bad Boy”), but they constantly balance out these images of rough exteriors with softer concepts on TV, such as in their Baskin Robbins commercial or parodies of female girl group dances on TV shows. By purposely crafting a balance between the both extremes (“flower boys” and “beast idols”) they have been able to attain their long-lasting appeal.
  Sun Jung uses the term “soft masculinity” to describe a non-national, hybrid construction—one that combines “traditional” masculinity with “cute” masculinity, thus approaching a “global metrosexual masculinity.” This seems to be the masculinity idealized and wholeheartedly capitalized upon by the K-pop industry. This idea is perhaps especially fitting for a society that is torn between its historical past intertwined with Confucian thought and its modern industrialization with a desire to reach global audiences. The confusing and at times contradictory portrayals of males in K-pop are all part of a greater multi-layered, culturally mixed, and strategically manufactured marketing ploy, but also extremely fitting to the greater social changes witnessed in the nation of South Korea.

There was a time, prior to Valentine’s Day 1989, when British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie was just that: a novelist and an essayist. Though highly esteemed and widely lauded even in those days, it was not until Iran’s late Ayatollah Khomeini issued a now infamous fatwa, or death order, against him that his public recognition really expanded.  Over the course of the next 11 years, a period he spent ducking and hiding from religious extremists, the world assigned him a plethora of new roles, including a symbol of free speech, critic of censorship, and pillar of secular humanistic thought. These days Rushdie is a literary and cultural superstar, an embodiment of one side of the post-9/11 struggle between extreme religious ideology and Western freedoms. It was this Salman Rushdie who gave the keynote address on the second day of the Boston Book Festival on Friday. The hour-long talk took the form of an interview, with questions fielded by Homi Bhabha, a professor of English and American literature and languages at Harvard and director of Harvard’s Mahindra Humanities Center. While the discussion was framed around Rushdie’s newest work, “Joseph Anton: A Memoir,” it also touched on his time in hiding, his continuing evolution as a writer, and his thoughts on the religious extremism that almost claimed his life.
Rushdie’s significance was not lost on the Boston community, as evidenced by the full crowd that filled the pews of the historic Old South Church to hear him speak. Rushdie, now in his 60s, acknowledged them with a small gesture and a smile as he took his seat in the front with unaffected nonchalance. His temperament remained constant throughout the night as he recounted some of the most difficult events in his life with humor and self-deprecation. Such was the case when Bhabha asked the first question of the night, wondering if Rushdie had any inkling of the storm that would follow in the wake of the publishing of his controversial book “The Satanic Verses.” “I knew they wouldn’t like it,” Rushdie said, speaking of his orthodox critics. “But they hadn’t liked anything I had done before. That’s the great thing about books: if you don’t like them, you close them, you don’t kill the author.” Despite this good humor, Rushdie went on to describe the harrowing experience of living as a man marked for death, even expressing that for a time he lost his faith in writing. It was during this period that he assumed his 11-year alias, Joseph Anton, a reference to two of his favorite authors: Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov. In fact, it was a variant on a line from Conrad’s “A Tale of the Sea” that he repeated to himself during his time in hiding: “Salman, you must live until you are dead.”
Early in the discussion, Bhabha referred to Rushdie’s memoir “Joseph Anton” as a bildungsroman. Rushdie agreed with this assessment, citing its definition as a story that chronicles growing up and gaining wisdom. His ordeal in hiding, he said, taught him to be wary of the “security view of the world.” For 11 years, he was limited in what he could and could not do in the name of safely, effectively robbing him of his personal agency.
Rushdie also expressed skepticism of religion, speculating on the existence of a “God-shaped black hole in the world” that some mistakenly try to fill with extremist conjectures of a mythical omnipotent. The atheist novelist explained how his disillusionment grew with religion in general, due in part to the responses that religious leaders of all creeds had to his fatwa. His detractors at the time included the Pope and the Chief Rabbi of England. At times, his sentiments felt somewhat out of touch with the overarching advocacy of tolerance that marked the rest of his address. “This is almost a good reason to come to church,” he said from his seat, perched below a hanging golden cross.
Although he ultimately survived the experience, Rushdie did express some regrets from his time in hiding. Namely, he voiced his concerns over whether running and leaving his home was the right thing to do. He also expressed frustration for how the controversy surrounding a few minor parts of “The Satanic Verses” obscured the rest of the book—now regarded as a masterpiece in the genre of magic realism. “People read these small dream sequences and let that speak for the entire book!” he said, continuing that there is much more to the book. “It’s funny! No one says it’s funny!” Despite these reservations, Rushdie insisted that his time in hiding was a formative one for him as a writer and as a person. In the last minutes of the address he read an excerpt from “Joseph Anton.” In the passage, Rushdie bemoans a narrowing of human identity, warning against the modern phenomena of perceived mutual exclusiveness in character. It stresses recognizing commonality even among the many inherent differences between people. The excerpt was an eloquent and generous ending to a tale saturated with fear and defiance. It portrayed Rushdie wearing his many new hats well, willing to share what his encounter with violent censorship taught him through rhetoric and through writing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The essence of a conductor’s profession is strength. The essence of a woman is weakness.”
These are the words of Yuri Temirkanov, the music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra from 1999 to 2006, whose interview was quoted by Alex Ross ’90 in his recent article for The New Yorker, “Women, Gays, and Classical Music.” In 2007, Temirkanov was succeeded by Marin Alsop—one of the most well-known female conductors in the world.
The gender bias shown in Temirkanov’s interview carries over to the performance arena as well. In 1982, clarinetist Sabine Meyer was asked to join the Berlin Philharmonic as one of the orchestra’s first female members. At the conclusion of her trial period, the rest of the orchestra members voted against her in an overwhelming vote of four for, 73 against. While tone contrast was cited as the original reason for the issue, many, including the orchestra’s own music director, Herbert von Karajan, insisted that her gender was what caused her dismissal.
At the same time, a study published in 1997 by Princeton professor Cecilia Rouse and Harvard professor Claudia Goldin showed that under blind audition conditions, the likelihood of a female musician advancing from the preliminary rounds of an audition increased by 50 percent, hinting at conscious and unconscious biases that continue to hold women back in the field of classical music.
Even within the Boston area itself, such a gender divide prevails—the Boston Symphony Orchestra has never had a female music director, and Harvard’s own Bach Society, whose conductors serve year-long terms, has only had two female conductors since its founding. As women’s representation in many fields approaches or even surpasses the halfway mark, classical music lags further and further behind, both in the wider music community and at Harvard itself.
GENDER PERFORMANCE
But though it has a ways to go, the music world has improved vastly, according to one professional. The director of piano seminars at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School and the namesake of the Angel Ramón Rivera Piano Competition, Angel R. Rivera has been on both ends of the audition process and has witnessed such an improvement personally.
“I have hired so many women conductors. It is unfair that today, women in top positions have to be so much more qualified than men,” Rivera says. “One of the most influential people in my life was Lorna Cooke deVaron, my co-conductor at NEC—I have never learned so much in my entire life.”
As Rivera continues to push for women’s equality in music—commissioning pieces by female composers and constantly striving to expose his classes at the NEC Preparatory School to female performers and composers—he recognizes that the state of women in music is much better than it used to be. “While it absolutely still is a problem today, women in orchestras used to be almost unheard of. The gender divide in music has improved so much over the past 30 or 40 years.”
In many respects, opportunities for women in classical music have indeed improved at Harvard and in the greater Boston area. The compositions of Harvard’s three main orchestras today—the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, the Bach Society, and the Mozart Society—all have near-equal distributions of men and women, as does the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Harvard’s own Music Department also shows balance between the genders. Although only one of the eight music concentrators is female, the majority of joint concentrators and students pursuing secondaries in the field are women —four of seven and eight of 11, respectively.
However, the gender equality is only skin deep. Even within Harvard’s orchestras, a closer analysis of the numbers reveals instruments weighted by gender. Instruments such as the double bass and horn section tend to be very male-dominated at Harvard and beyond, with HRO’s trumpet and trombone sections being entirely male. For other instruments, such as the flute, the players are mostly female. Harvard’s statistics are in keeping with the professional musical world and may even be slightly better: the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s gender divide in instruments is even more polarizing, with only men in the basses, oboes, trumpets, trombones, percussion, and clarinets.
A DIVIDED ORCHESTRA
This gender divide seems to stem not only from subjective auditions but also from a lack of gender diversity in the auditionees, implying that the gap begins when children decide what instrument they want to play. According to a 2008 study done at the University of London, historically, girls have consistently chosen to study instruments that are smaller and have higher pitch, while the boys tackle the heftier, deeper instruments.
Adela H. Kim ’16, who is currently comping The Crimson’s Arts Board, comes from a family of musicians. Her father, a pianist, and her mother, a violinist, both went to Juilliard, as does her sister, who is studying the violin. Kim plays the clarinet, an instrument typically dominated by male players, and was admitted to the joint Harvard-NEC program after studying at the Juilliard Pre-College for seven years. However, the clarinet was not her first choice.
“When I was little, I really wanted to play the piano, but my father told me, ‘People out there don’t respect women pianists,’” Kim says. Entering Juilliard Pre-College in seventh grade, Kim was one of the only female clarinetists in the school and her teacher’s only female student. When it came time to compete and audition in a male-dominated field, Kim had to worry about aspects of the audition that wouldn’t concern her male colleagues.
“For auditions, we’d always go and find a nice long dress—we’d play up the fact that I was a woman,” Kim recalls. However, she always took care to ensure that her outfit would serve as no detriment to her audition process.
“My father served as a juror for many music competitions and auditions, and he would bring home stories of how wearing too much makeup or a dress that was too short could make or break the audition,” Kim says. “There were so many more factors that affected women that didn’t affect men.”
PASSING THE BATON
Women may lag behind men in musical performance, but the field of conducting is far more severely skewed. Even within Harvard, the invisible barrier stands. Since its inception in 1954, the Bach Society has only had two female music directors: Diana L. Watt ’81, who served as the orchestra’s music director from 1981-1982, and Grace M. Kao ’01, who served from 2000-2001. HRO’s recent trends also concur: at least since the arrival of Federico Cortese, the music director of HRO for its fifth consecutive year, the orchestra-chosen assistant conductor has always been male even though most of the leading players are female. Cortese, who is the conductor of HRO and is a senior lecturer in the Music Department, is also concerned with the gender gap.
“Historically, women artists have always been a tiny minority for social reasons. Most of these reasons are thankfully—if slowly—disappearing,” Cortese says. Yet stark divisions still remain; Cortese mentioned that for HRO, the applicants for the position of student conductor were disproportionately male in the past five years.
“Conducting is still a field where the imbalance is very clear. There are certainly increasing numbers of very prominent women composers. I would not say however that the numbers are even yet,” Cortese says. “There are much fewer women conductors than men, no doubt about that. Why that is so, I don't know. I guess it is a profession that has come for a long time with a sort of stereotypical ‘macho’ image.”
Cortese has conducted many of the great orchestras around the world, including serving as assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He teaches a spring conducting class at Harvard, enrollment in which requires an audition. Last year, out of the 12 aspiring conductors who auditioned for entrance to the class, three were female, and one was chosen for the six-person class: Jessica D. Rucinski ’14.
Rucinski is pursuing a secondary in music to accompany her concentration in physics, and she has been involved with nearly all of the major music groups on Harvard campus, from DJing for the classical music board of WHRB to serving on the board of the Harvard Early Music Society. Rucinski started piano at the age of six and sang in choirs from second grade onward. She cites her initial interest in conducting as originating around the age of 13 due to her frustration with a bad choral director. “I would think, ‘If I were the conductor, this is what I would do to make it better,’” Rucinski says, adding that while most choral directors in her experience were female, this drastically differs from the rest of classical music. “We have these biases that we don’t even know about—we say ‘Oh, it’s totally fine for a woman to be a conductor, we’d totally hire her,’ but in practice, it’s not true.”
In conducting class under Cortese, Rucinski says she was never treated any differently than the male students in the class. “It wasn’t about my gender—the problems [Cortese] worked on with everyone were their own specific problems,” she says. However, Rucinski is still concerned about the vast gender gap in conducting, the persistence of which she partially attributes to a lack of female role models in the industry.
The Boston Symphony Orchestra’s own history bears out Rucinski’s claim—the first female assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra was Shi-Yeon Sung, whose three-year tenure ended in 2010. Sung was also the first woman to win the prestigious Sir Georg Solti International Conductors’ Competition. The Boston Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1881, has never had a female music director, though Nadia Boulanger became the first woman to conduct the orchestra in 1938.
“I recently read an article about why more girls don’t do science, and it’s because there aren’t female role models that they can look up to. The same applies to conducting,” Rucinski says. “If, when I was younger, I had thought I, as a girl, could have been a conductor, maybe things would have been different.”
NOTES ON THE PAGE
Arielle G. Rabinowitz ’14 agrees with Rucinski on this point. Rabinowitz, a concentrator in psychology with a secondary in music, is enrolled in the Harvard-NEC joint program with her twin sister, Danielle G. Rabinowitz ’14, and will receive her master's in composition from the NEC in the spring of 2015. Rabinowitz, who began composing at 11, cites her composing teacher and her mother as her role models.
“My teacher, Alla Cohen, has a very dominant personality and has always encouraged me to keep going with composing, especially at times when I was trying to choose between [playing] piano and composing,” Rabinowitz says. “My mother was a harpsichordist and a pianist, and as piano has played a large part in my life—I’ve been playing piano for the past 15, 16 years—she’s someone I really look up to.”
As a female composer at Harvard, Rabinowitz is in the minority. Out of the 14 more active members of the Harvard Composing Association (HCA), four are female. However, last year’s two co-chairs were both women.
For Rabinowitz, her status as a minority in the classical music world is invigorating, not discouraging. “It’s empowering to be one of the few female composers,” she says. “It’s a unique niche.”
HALF STEPS FORWARD
Attached to the rich historical tradition of classical music is a tradition of excluding women. Gustav Mahler, for example, forbade his wife, Alma, from composing. Such tendencies even pervade the very language of music: in music theory, strong cadences used to be styled “masculine,” while weaker cadences were given the title of “feminine.” Today, however, those terms are falling out of favor, as are the gender biases of which they are indicative.
While the classical music communities both at Harvard and at large have come leaps and bounds from the completely male-dominated world of old, music still has strides to make for complete equality. But with active and ambitious up-and-comers in the musical world, what was once a male-dominated field is increasingly populated by female performers, composers, and conductors.
Concert pianist Yuja Wang, who gave a talk at Harvard on Friday, is one such artist. “The kinds of people that tend to do really well in this type of career are women who have masculine sides and men that have feminine sides. I guess being androgynous is the way,” she says. “People say it is harder for women because of the physical aspect—we have big programs and small hands, and it takes a lot of stamina. But I don’t work out—I just play my concerts and it is fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The remake of the movie adaptation of the Stephen King novel “Carrie” came out this past Friday. The most iconic scene in the novel and its adaptations is a prom prank that leaves Carrie covered in pig’s blood, causing her to lash out telekinetically and (spoiler alert) kill pretty much everybody in the movie. In honor of the release of this adaptation, the Arts Blog recounts the best pranks in movie history:

 
The Dead Horse in “Animal House”Arguably the first “prank-within-a-prank,” frat king Bluto (John Belushi) convinces young Flounder (Stephen Furst) to kill a fascist ROTC captain’s horse and put it in the dean’s office. Unbeknownst to Flounder, Bluto has filled the gun with blanks. However, when Flounder chickens out and shoots the gun at the ceiling, the horse dies of a heart attack, resulting in the most tragic equine scene since the horse head in “The Godfather.”
 
The White Paint in “Dazed and Confused”In the second biggest prank of Ben Affleck’s career (after his appearance in the “Jenny from the Block” music video), incoming high school freshmen pour white paint all over his character Fred O’Bannion as revenge for his hazing ritual of paddle-whacking their behinds. O’Bannion then goes on a hilarious tirade against those around him (the second funniest thing in Affleck’s career after his appearance in “Jenny from the Block”).
 
The Flaming Bag of Dog Poop in “Disturbia”Two sniveling kids put a bag of flaming feces on Kale Brecht’s (Shia Labeouf)’s doorstep, knowing that he is under house arrest and can’t run after them. Kale’s anger pushes him over the edge, and he stabs and screams at his ankle bracelet to no avail. This is arguably the least violent of the pranks on this list (in a horror movie about the serial killer next door).
 
Various Assaults in “Home Alone”Arguably more a sadistic survival mechanism than a legitimate prank, Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) camps out in front of a doggy door and shoots a burglar (played by Joe Pesci) in the genitals with a BB gun (oddly reminiscent of Pesci’s death scene in “Goodfellas”). The branding of the film, which is chock-full of potentially lethal attacks by the eight-year-old Kevin, as a comedy and a kid’s movie is arguably one of the least responsible marketing decisions of all time. After seeing this movie, not only are millennials pathologically horrified of robbery, but they also think that almost castrating, stabbing, and biting burglars is a better call than attempting to leave the house.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most of what I miss about Lake Forest, a small suburb of Chicago and my hometown, are just things we all leave behind when growing up—like having family all in one place, which felt permanent for so long and then suddenly was not. However, when I learned that fewer and fewer monarch butterflies follow a migratory pattern through northern Illinois every year, it seemed liked nature was cruelly imitating my own dimming memories of the place, cutting off my home from its actual beauty at the same time I decided to stop idealizing it.
But the wildlife wasn’t just a dream; it was Lake Forest’s most crucial addition to my childhood, a vital way to fulfill my youthful desire for exploration, and one of the only things my parents could not have given me in a city. My earliest memories involve obsessing over books full of pictures of local animal and insect life, then eagerly wandering around outside in my backyard or the school playground, attempting to catch sight of any creature I could. The abundant Open Lands preserve was my family’s favorite haunt on the weekends, and I grew to love the damp, shadowy parks farther out in northern Illinois and Wisconsin, which were frequent middle school campout sites.
In late summer and early fall, the most beautiful sights in any of these places are monarch butterflies lightly resting on flowers and shirtsleeves. Their vigorous orange and black patterning is undeniably more striking than any other color combination among the deep, dark tones of the lakeshore, so it’s not difficult to understand why the schoolchildren of Decatur lobbied for them to become Illinois’s official state insect in 1974.
For children, whose imaginations have not yet been fully suffocated by realism, why wouldn’t a gorgeous pair of wings be the most important cause in the world? For adults, the factors behind monarch depopulation form a litany of man-made environmental crimes we have all heard before: logging, herbicide used on genetically modified crops, global warming—all crimes we postpone dealing with because, we tell ourselves, we must prioritize worrying about ensuring cheaper food and more jobs for fellow humans.
This may be true, and I don’t pretend to have the knowledge to determine whether or not butterflies are necessary casualties. But it is time to stop pretending that known consequences human actions inflict upon nature are in any way innocent. At the end of his recent op-ed in the New York Times, Verlyn Klinkenborg writes that monarch depopulation is the obvious circumstance of living “in a world of unintended consequences of our own making, which can never be easily undone.” 
The statement comes across as hopelessly disingenuous after an entire article exploring the phenomenon’s man-made causes. Nature only stands a chance of being saved from man-made destruction once it is factored into the equations we use to make economic decisions. If we know we are destroying it, we can no longer call its destruction an unintended consequence. The death of monarch butterflies isn’t a tragedy, but rather a consequence of us choosing not to recognize what is being lost until it is too late.
Our muted observation of the demise of monarch butterflies comes across as particularly callous when viewed through the roles butterflies play as a cultural touchstone throughout the world. Aesthetics alone do not explain our childlike attraction to them. This is best demonstrated in the acclaimed, harrowing novel “The Collector,” in which English experimentalist author John Fowles draws on centuries of butterfly symbolism, from the ancient Greek use of ψυχή (psȳchē) to describe the soul after death and the butterfly, to Christian use of the chrysalis as a symbol of Christ’s resurrection, to the folkloric Japanese belief that it is customary for souls to take the shape of a butterfly in order to signal their final departure from the body.
The book centers on the experiences of Miranda Grey, a college student kidnapped by a butterfly collector. As she lies humiliated and dying in captivity, Grey begins to develop a kind, nuanced understanding of the individual responsible for her death. Originally a typical privileged college student, with the outsize concern for herself we all have, Grey literally loses her self out of concern for someone who appears barely human to the reader.
It is the combination of fragility and beauty found in butterflies, and the amazing transformative process they undergo, that have made them a common symbol for self-awareness and transcendence of desire. These are precisely the aspects of human personality missing from our regard for nature. Concern for nature is not a sign of being over-privileged, but rather of humility, in the recognition that something other than human life is important.
It is impossible not to admire Miranda, whose last thoughts are “I don’t mind for myself any more”—her loss of ego accompanies her loss of life, resulting in a fully empathetic, freed spirit of the sort we would imagine as a butterfly. It is precisely because of our privilege that we have no excuse. By recognizing that we are responsible for what is happening to monarchs, and that the consequences of human actions are preventable rather than inevitable, we can begin to fulfill our own best expectations of ourselves.

“The saddest spot in Manhattan.” That’s what The New York Times and Science Magazine called my high school several weeks ago, citing a study that analyzed the emotional content of tweets from across the city. Last week, the study’s authors admitted they’d made a mistake—the flood of negative sentiment was not from Hunter College High School’s “intellectually gifted” students but instead generated by a single user just south of the school. (There’s one disgruntled hot dog vendor I’d put my money on, but I’m not naming any names.)
Most of my former classmates were pleased with this reversal, but for me it raised a number of questions. Do people actually get paid to do studies like this? Is Twitter a thing at Hunter now? And, on a more serious note: Could being the saddest group of people in the most neurotic city on earth be something other than a point of shame? 
Ernest Hemingway observed: “Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.” Another great thinker, Lisa Simpson, corroborates: “As intelligence goes up, happiness goes down. See, I made a graph.” (Hemingway may have had a longer resume and might not have been too animated, but Lisa Simpson is the better dresser. And she has a graph.)
Does this relationship between intelligence and misery hold? Statistical evidence suggests otherwise: I.Q. and happiness appear to vary together. Statistics can be powerful, and it is generally irresponsible to ignore them. But when they contradict the conclusion that you’re trying to establish, I recommend pointing out that rogue and lackadaisical econometricians can get up to all sorts of funny business, like forgetting to use heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (the nerve of some people).
In any case, common sense and observation lend support to the Hemingway-Simpson hypothesis.
As Jonathan Safran Foer notes, it’s much easier to think yourself out of happiness than into it.
Cerebral people do more thinking. They process more data and notice more problems with themselves and the world.
And so, Harvard, I have a question. If I ask how you are, you’ll tell me you’re tired; you’ll tell me you’re stressed. I’m sure it’s true some of the time, but I also suspect that it’s just as close as you think you’re allowed to get to “crummy” or even “depressed.” What really rattles your chain, grinds your gears, makes it so your boat doesn’t float?
Of course, I could be projecting. Maybe I’m the only one who is seriously troubled by the fact that she hasn’t yet figured out the meaning of life, who has periods of all-but-paralyzing self-doubt (which is why parentheticals are great—they let you disclaim and qualify like it’s nobody’s business).
But is it really enough to be pre-law, pre-med, or pre-money? Is it enough to be drunk? Does that “wellness” study break make you feel better, or does it add insult to injury by insinuating that frozen yogurt could assuage your angst, existential or otherwise?
Abraham Lincoln suggested, “Most folks are about as happy as they make their minds up to be.” Indeed, there’s a strong argument to be made that we should fight the melancholy, focus on the positive, and be grateful for what we have instead of anxious about what we lack. If this directed thinking works in theory, it should work in practice, in theory.
But for some people—Lincoln, who suffered from clinical depression, probably included—choosing to be happy is easier said than done. At the risk of attracting your pity, disgust, or “fremdschämen” (this word roughly translates to “vicarious embarrassment,” and we should buy it from the Germans before they realize how good it is and raise the price), I have a hard time imagining being content. The show would be over, the curtain would fall, and the backup dancers would all go home.
Satisfaction would be a simple matter if all we had to do to achieve it was to fulfill our basic needs—the world is full of sandwiches, many of them bologna and muenster. But we are people, not planarians. We require more than food and an aqueous environment with the right salinity and pH. Our capacity to reason might make us sad, but it may very well be what makes us human.
I don’t think it’s impossible for some to marshal their intelligence to serve their mental states. Nor do I believe that our SAT scores absolve us of our responsibility to try to be happy, even when this feels like treading water with no land in sight.
But we live in a society that’s perceptibly uncomfortable with the ill-at-ease, even when 50 percent of the population is of below-median happiness. Whether that’s the smarter half, I cannot say. What I can say is that, if you are feeling bad, it seems unfair that you should have to add that to your list of things to feel bad about.

An academic discovers breathtaking frescoes decaying in a distant land and takes them to a cultural hub for careful preservation and the enjoyment of the general public. Is he a hero to the art world, or is he a thief?
This is the question at the center of the thorny debate over repatriation of museum holdings at Harvard and across the globe: Over centuries, prominent museums have acquired art holdings from historians who have traveled abroad, discovered ancient works, and appropriated them for display back in their home countries. Now, many countries are requesting that pieces taken from their turf be returned. A Crimson Arts feature from last week detailed the challenges faced by Harvard museums in wrestling with this question. We appreciate Harvard Art Museums’ efforts to comply with repatriation requests to the best of their ability. At the same time, we are grateful that Harvard and other educational centers have such impressive collections of historical, foreign art for public enrichment.
According to the feature, Harvard Art Museums owns a dozen murals that art historian Langdon Warner brought to Cambridge from Dunhuang, China in 1924. These frescoes delighted Fogg museumgoers for decades, but some Dunhuang residents view Warner’s acquisition as a robbery, and many demand that Harvard send the works back to China. The same trend has plagued museums all over the United States. This summer, for example, the New York City Metropolitan Museum of Art returned two ancient statues to Cambodia in response to an ownership challenge, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles has been arguing with Turkey over a fifth-century artifact since 1995.
It may seem as if complying with repatriation requests is the only just path for a museum to follow. Pieces of art integral to the cultural history of certain countries lie in foreign hands, and those countries seem right in desiring their return. In particular, cases of Western civilizations claiming art from non-Western countries ring warning bells suggesting exploitation by imperialist powers. For this reason, certain frameworks—like international agreements made by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization—govern the ownership of items that have been illegally exported or that may be otherwise unethical for museums to display.
On the other hand, shipping fragile art thousands of miles overseas can pose practical problems. Warner’s murals, for example, were peeled off cave walls using an experimental process and will deteriorate if moved. And even when pieces can be delivered to their lands of origin without fear of damage, the museums that own them now can often promise better, securer preservation.
What’s more, ancient artifacts may gain more of the exposure and recognition they deserve in cultural hubs like Boston, New York, and Los Angeles than in some of their original homes. Established museums also have the ability to draw on their vast resources to provide viewers with substantial historical and contextual information about the pieces they see, information that preserves and honors the legacy of the art and the culture that produced it.
Given these considerations, we appreciate Harvard Art Museums’ attempts to work within existing legal repatriation frameworks and to honor repatriation requests when the museums can reasonably do so. We hope that museums everywhere will manage to strike a balance between ensuring artifacts’ care and respecting the wishes of the countries from where those artifacts came.

Given the impenetrable language and technocratic sneer of the stereotypical economist, you could be forgiven for assuming the heart of economics is utterly devoid of all morality. After reading about the mind-bogglingly sleazy world of credit default swaps and then sighing at your dismal retirement account returns, you could be forgiven for recoiling from a financial industry that increasingly seems like the horrific lovechild of “Bonfire of the Vanities” and “American Pscyho.”
To modern eyes, economics may seem sociopathically amoral, if not deeply immoral. That’s an unfortunate, though forgivable, association. A pernicious glorification of wealth has attached itself to the discipline, crowding out its deeper moral ideas.
Economics was always rooted in morality. For all its desire to wear the mask of a positive, descriptive science, economics is replete with normative moral axioms. The core assumptions of economics—rational activity, the benefits of choice, and the belief that uncoordinated pursuit of individual self-interest leads to a more efficient society—are profoundly moral ideas.
But that should be no surprise. After all, the wondrous birth of the dismal science came during the Scottish Enlightenment through eminent philosophers like David Hume and Adam Smith, who authored “A Theory of Moral Sentiments” in addition to the more famous “The Wealth of Nations,” and chaired the department of moral sciences at the University of Glasgow.
Interestingly, the man who proposed the brilliant theory of the invisible hand animated by self-interest was the same who also urged us to, “feel much for others and little for ourselves, that to restrain our selfish, and to indulge our benevolent affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature.”
Economics carries its own moral ideas, but moral ideas can also latch onto economics.
Ibn Khaldun, the fourteenth century founding father of the social sciences, was also a morally trained thinker, receiving a deep education in the Islamic sciences before going on to practically single-handedly develop the fields of sociology, historiography, and economics.
A decidedly Platonic spirit, where virtue was the fundamental root of success, infused his writing. “Businesses owned by responsible and organized merchants shall eventually surpass those owned by wealthy rulers,” he wrote in his magnum opus “Muqaddimah.”
That deep sense that financial success and moral rectitude are coupled is characteristic of many societies. The only ones who seemed opposed were the especially religious—“It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God” is an oft-ignored verse of the Bible—and a few Romantic poets—“Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,” Wordsworth wrote in a sonnet.
But the incredible deference given to the title of “billionaire” and celebrification of wealth in the modern era shows that the moral judgment equating net worth with intrinsic worth is pervasive.
Much of the appeal comes in its simplicity. Finding moral depravity as the cause of poverty not only absolves the rest of society of responsibility, but it also makes economics into a morality play, tacitly reassuring the possibly guilty at the peak of the socioeconomic pyramid.
Even the poor of America see themselves as “temporarily embarrassed millionaires,” Steinbeck allegedly said.
The life-as-morality-play narrative remains the dividing line between conservative and liberal economists, but has more concrete impact than an inconsequential academic debate.
The convention slows down progress in areas where economic fact and empirics have been largely decisive. Germany insists on imposing fiscal austerity on European countries in crisis because it simply seems right to do so.
Never mind that the austerity argument has fallen apart spectacularly, it seems that Chancellor Merkel knows that something punitive must happen.
The initially counterintuitive, anti-cyclical Keynesianism—where countries spend during recessions and save during expansions—is viewed skeptically despite being vindicated during the crisis. All because it doesn’t fit the narrative of economic malaise as righteous comeuppance.
Compare the United States, where the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary monetary expansion has brought us out of a recession despite Congress’ destructive fiscal cuts, with the United Kingdom, which embraced the austerity mantra and found itself facing a triple-dip recession.
The fundamental ideas of economics—that personal liberty and freedom of choice was both more efficient and more moral—have been subsumed by an unfortunate canard: a worship of wealth that glorifies the rich and belittles the poor.

After more than three decades serving the Cambridge community and visitors with its famously flamboyant flair, UpStairs on the Square is set to close its doors on Dec. 31, co-founders and co-owners Mary-Catherine Deibel and Deborah Hughes announced in an email to subscribers over the weekend.
In an interview with The Crimson Monday, Deibel and Hughes elaborated that the building was up for sale by the landlord. Deibel said that the sale of the building presented a logical time to end the long-running business, and she and Hughes decided not to sell it.
Hughes explained that the restaurant, with its bright pink, zebra-patterned dining room and exotic menu, is her and Deibel’s own creation and brand.
“The restaurant is Mary-Catherine and myself because we’ve been there for so long, so we haven’t really spent a lot of time thinking about selling,” Hughes said.
Harvard Square will lose one of its most iconic fixtures with the closure of the restaurant at 91 Winthrop St. Debiel said that for many years, she and her team considered UpStairs on the Square to be Harvard’s restaurant, adding that they enjoyed “lots of history with the Pudding and the Kroks.”
“We’ve so appreciated the support of Harvard students of all kinds and Harvard faculty over the years,” she said.
Ben J. Marek ’14, general manager of the Harvard Krokodiloes, said the relationship between the a cappella group and UpStairs on the Square represents a special part of the Krok experience, as members perform at the restaurant’s brunch each Sunday.
“We’re sad to hear the restaurant is no longer going to be a part of Harvard Square,” Marek said. “There really isn’t anything else in Harvard Square quite like UpStairs. It’s a really unique place.”
This quality stems not only from the dining room’s eclectic décor, but also its storied history. Members of the Harvard football team worked as some of the restaurant’s first dishwashers, and its dining room has hosted many celebrity patrons, including Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone, and Robin Williams.
“I never really look in the rear-view mirror, but I am remembering more about our past at this time,” Hughes said.
Hughes recounted such memorable moments as when Ella Fitzgerald sang “Happy Birthday” to one of the sous-chefs in the kitchen and when she asked the late Rev. Peter J. Gomes to bless the Winthrop Street location when he was dining there.
“It’s very hard to imagine these moments in the venue ending, but I expect reality will settle in soon,” she said.
Deibel and Hughes met while working at the restaurant Peasant Stock in Somerville and opened UpStairs at the Pudding together in 1982, which originally was housed on the third floor of the Hasty Pudding Club at 10 Holyoke St.
“It was a small business that rapidly exploded into a very big business,” Deibel said.
When Harvard ousted UpStairs at the Pudding from its original location in 2001, the owners leased a space at the corner of Winthrop and JFK Streets. The restaurant reemerged the following year as UpStairs on the Square.
While neither owner has formed definitive plans for the future, Deibel said she is entertaining the option of increasing her nonprofit work, and Hughes said she will embark on another food-related venture and possibly market some of the restaurant’s well-known products, such as the chocolate turtles and red-pepper soup.
UpStairs on the Square plans to host various formal dinners and events before its final day at the end of the year.
“We hope that everybody comes to say goodbye to us over the next two and a half months,” Deibel said.

A former Harvard hockey star and active alumnus will become the managing director for private equity at Harvard Management Company, HMC announced in a press release on Monday.
Lane MacDonald ’88-’89, who will take the reigns of the Company’s private equities this December, is currently the managing director for public markets. He was promoted to that position in 2012, four years after joining HMC as senior vice president for private equity in 2008. The Company oversees and invests Harvard’s $33 billion endowment.
“With the right leadership, this is an asset class that presents unique opportunities for attractive returns,” HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said in the press release. “I am confident that the experience Lane brings to his new position will enable HMC to focus its resources to deliver sustained excellence and market outperformance.”
HMC’s previous private equity director, Peter F. Dolan ’83, left in April with no explanation from the Company or University.
John M. Shue ’91, the senior vice president of private equity, has been serving as interim managing director since Dolan left.
Private equities are one of HMC’s largest asset classes, though they have lagged behind other types of investments in recent years. In HMC’s last annual report, Mendillo wrote that HMC’s performance in private equities for fiscal year 2013, which ended in July, was “fair,” partly because its returns of 11 percent were significantly lower than those of the Company’s public equities.
Head of Alternative Assets Andrew G. Wiltshire, who will oversee MacDonald, said in Monday’s announcement that MacDonald would be a good fit to help reshape the HMC’s private equities strategy.
“Lane has been a terrific contributor to HMC since his arrival and we look forward to his leadership and contribution to our private equity portfolio,” said Wiltshire.  “We are continually honing our strategy in this area to ensure we are working with the best managers with the greatest potential, and I know that Lane will add tremendous value as the new Managing Director of this important asset class.”
HMC is not by any means MacDonald’s only connection to Harvard, nor was it his first. In 1988, he represented the United States in the Winter Olympics before going on to captain the men’s hockey team to an NCAA Championship victory in 1989. MacDonald has also served as director of the Harvard Alumni Association and is currently president of the Harvard Varsity Club, an alumni association for former athletes.

Under the leadership of new director, professor Peter Der Manuelian, and with the support of a new umbrella organization, Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, the Harvard Semitic Museum is set to launch an array of both structural and exhibitional developments in the coming years.
The Harvard Semitic Museum was founded in 1889 and has been located at 6 Divinity Avenue since 1903. It features collections from regions across the Ancient Near East. Roman glass, Egyptian mummies, ethnographic garments from Palestine, pottery from Cyprus, and one of the largest cuneiform tablet collections outside of Baghdad are a few of the many diverse artifacts currently on display.
The upcoming changes to the museum are intended to increase accessibility and overall attendance. Manuelian is personally overseeing the changes, along with deputy director and curator Joseph A. Greene and assistant curator Adam Aja.
“We are embarking on some pretty grand plans to renovate the spaces in the museum, make them friendlier, make them more accessible, make them more exciting, and augment the different shows with interactive technologies to teach visitors more about the Ancient Near East,” Manuelian said.
Within the museum, Manuelian plans to transform the first floor gallery into a rotating special exhibitions gallery. The second floor will feature a permanent Egyptian exhibition, while the third floor will contain collections focusing on Mesopotamia.
“Manuelian’s grand vision, I estimate, will take us 5 years, and maybe more.  There will be a lot of steps to take in the interim,” Greene said.
According to Maunelian, the exhibitions will also heavily feature the use of technologies like interactive screens enabling visitors to see enhanced images of real artifacts, 3-D printers, and virtual reality headsets.
“For us, the technology is a way of expanding our gallery square footage without having to build anything,” Greene said. “ You can now do things with technology that are simply astounding.”
While many of the changes are organizational, some are physical and practical. One planned change is the installation of an elevator in the building—a feature the building has lacked for over a century.
“[The addition of an elevator] sounds mundane,” Manuelian said, “but because we have galleries on the second and third floors, and there are many people who have trouble negotiating stairs, two-thirds of our museum had been cut off from public view.”
With the elevator’s scheduled completion in December of this year, Manuelian believes that its presence will be a “game changer” for attracting more student visitors and members of the public.
Students also expressed hope that the proposed changes at the Semitic Museum will spur increased interest.
“On Harvard’s campus it seems like there a thousand things for undergraduates to do and see,” James M. A. Bollinger ’17 said. “Hopefully, these changes will at least increase undergraduate interest in its exhibits and message.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before an audience of students, professors, and other members of the Harvard community, John Wood, founder and board co-chair of Room to Read, discussed his experiences founding the educational non-profit and laid out key lessons about social entrepreneurship and leadership at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on Monday.
During the talk, Wood emphasized the importance of education in improving not only individual lives, but also the general welfare of a nation.
“Education is what provides economic lift-off for developing nations,” Wood said.
According to its website, Room to Read, an award-winning non-profit organization that focuses on improving gender equality and literacy in the developing world, has built 1,681 schools, established 15,320 libraries, and has benefited 7.8 million children to date since its establishment in 1999. Wood said that the organization is on track to achieve its goal of helping 10 million children receive an education by 2020.
After discussing the non-profit’s humble beginnings as a “bootstrap” with no employees, no money, no academic expertise, and no experience, Wood presented his “12 key lessons of the last 12 years,” offering general advice on running a social enterprise. Among the strategies discussed included the importance of strong, entrepreneurial local teams.
“You can’t get things done in a local context if you don’t have people who understand the history, the culture, and the language,” Wood said.
Wood added that the organization implemented this strategy by drawing 85 percent of its employees locally and nationally, as well as publishing 887 books in the mother tongue of the nations in which it serves.
“We want to build as much indigenous capacity as possible,” Wood said, adding that the strategy has made these institutions sustainable by giving local communities a sense of ownership.
Wood also outlined the power of storytelling in attracting potential donors.
“People don’t remember the words you speak. They remember how your words made [them] feel,” Wood said. “What we try to do is tell the stories that invite people in by showing the promise and potential.”
When asked to give advice on social enterprise specific to college and graduate students, Wood stressed the importance of passion and work ethic.
“Most of the really big things that have happened around social change have been inserted by people who didn’t really know what they were doing, but they had the passion and the work ethic,” Wood said.
Allison G. Celosia, a student at the Graduate School of Education, said she “enjoyed the discussion.”
“John Wood is able to harness the energy of his organization and...to share that with an audience anywhere,” Celosia said.
The seminar, which was part of the South Asia Institute at Harvard University’s social enterprise seminar series, was co-sponsored by SAI and The International Education Policy Program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A popular and widely used workout supplement, Craze, has been discovered to contain a substance similar to methamphetamine, according to new research from Harvard Medical School.
The substance, N,alpha-diethylphenylethylamine (N,alpha-DEPEA), which is not listed as an ingredient on the supplement’s label, has never been studied in humans, and little is known about its health effects.
Driven Sports, Inc., the producer of Craze, advertises the performance-enhancing supplement on its website as the “ultimate in pre-workout power.” Craze was named “New Supplement of the Year” in 2012 by bodybuilding.com but came under investigation after several athletes taking Craze failed urine drug tests.
The supplement’s label claims that it contains the substance N,N-Diethyl-Phenylethylamine (N,N-DEPEA), which is derived from dendrobium orchids and contains the same constituent atoms of the meth-like chemical N, alpha-DEPEA but arranged in a different structure and thus eliciting different properties.
“We didn’t find anything in dendrobium that should be a stimulant,” said Pieter A. Cohen, co-author of the study and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.
The study, published online in the journal Drug Testing and Analysis on October 14, tested three samples of Craze purchased online and in a GNC vitamin and mineral store, and found 21 to 35 milligrams of N,alpha-DEPEA per manufacturer recommended serving of Craze. These tests were performed at NSF International in Michigan, a global independent public health and environmental organization, and confirmed by the Korean Forensic Service.
According to the paper, N, alpha-DEPEA is a “potentially dangerous designer drug” that has not been found in any plant, including dendrobium. The authors also claim that the amount of the substance in each serving rules out the possibility of minor contamination from the manufacturing process.
Because it has never been tested in humans, the health effects of N, alpha-DEPEA are largely unknown.
“It might act like a mild stimulant...and might cause some sense of euphoria,” Cohen said.
Driven Sports released a statement a day after the study was published, announcing that it had “suspended production and sale of Craze several months ago while it investigated the reports in the media regarding the safety of Craze.” The results of their own studies identified the presence of the substance N-beta DEPEA in Craze, which the company insists is a “very different substance” than N-alpha DEPEA.
The authors of the study contacted the FDA about their conclusions in May, but the FDA has yet to release an official public statement regarding the drug. Cohen said that the FDA should more actively screen supplements.
Other researchers echoed Cohen’s call for more FDA intervention.
Paul A. Offit, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, asserted, “This isn’t the first time supplements are contaminated. It shows the problem with the dietary supplement industry—it’s essentially unregulated by the FDA.”

Despite Cambridge Vice Mayor E. Denise Simmons’ tweet Monday afternoon alerting her followers to that night’s policy order on the impact of the government shutdown on subsidized renters, it was the net zero petition that dominated the public hearing at Monday night’s City Council meeting.
Supporters of the new environmental initiative—a group varied in age, gender, and occupation—gathered at the meeting to listen to City Manager Richard C. Rossi’s plan for the newly established task force’s appointments.
Attendees expressed a general concern that once the task force was created, the energy behind the petition would dissipate and the planning stage would be dragged out ad infinitum.
Net zero advocate Patty Nolan acknowledged this sentiment when she quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.: “Such an attitude [of waiting] stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively.”
Amongst the city councillors, only Councillor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom addressed questions and concerns to Rossi regarding the timeline and purpose of the task force.
“A good editorial in the NYT was talking about a carbon budget, and I would like that concept to be included in the conversation going forward,” said vanBeuzekom. “We are going to grow—that is true—and in order for us to stay within a carbon budget we need to become even more efficient.”
Addressing vanBeuzekom’s concern that the task force would not have a permanent chair, Rossi proposed that the task force be chair-less, and instead led by a group of experts that would work closely together with city staff in additional areas, such as the committee on Cambridge’s resilience and adaptation capacity in the face of climate change.
Both Rossi and vanBeuzekom agreed that they want the task force to have an action plan ready by December 2014.
As the focus of the meeting turned towards the government shutdown, Councillor Craig A. Kelley opened the discussion on Simmons’ policy order to develop a contingency plan to ensure that Cambridge residents receiving fully or partially subsidized rent from federal grants would not see their housing jeopardized in the event of another federal government shutdown.
All councillors voted to adopt the order, but expressed a desire to learn more about the effects of another federal government shutdown on city operations.
“Is it possible that people [will] wind up getting evicted? I realize that the eviction process can take a while but we would find ourselves, if that were the case, with a flood of eviction concerns,” Kelley said.

UPDATED: October 22, 2013, at 9:57 p.m.
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino will not be accepting offers of employment from Harvard University after he leaves office, Menino spokesperson Dot Joyce told The Crimson on Tuesday.
On Tuesday morning, The Boston Herald reported a potential conflict-of-interest with Menino’s job offers from the University, taking issue with the recent approval of a multibillion dollar plan for Harvard redevelopment in Allston by a board of officials who Menino appointed.
“The Herald failed to report that the mayor is not going to Harvard,” said Joyce. “There is no conflict of interest, because the mayor has no intention—he is not intending to go to Harvard.”
Responding to Joyce's comments, Richard Weir, the reporter covering the story for The Herald, said the Menino administration would not say on the record on Monday that Menino was planning to turn down the position.
According to Joyce, Menino had informed Harvard “recently” of his decision. Joyce said she could not recall the exact date on which Menino had given word to the University.
Lauren M. Marshall, a Harvard communications officer, wrote in an emailed statement that two of Harvard’s schools “were interested in having Mayor Menino pass on his insights and the lessons of his experience to students.” Tuesday’s Boston Globe reported that the Kennedy School and the School of Public Health had offered Menino positions.
At a forum on Monday, Menino told the audience that numerous academic institutions, including Harvard University, Boston University, Northeastern University, and Suffolk University, had offered him positions, according to The Boston Globe.
On Thursday night, the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved Harvard’s 10-year, nine-project master plan for development in Allston. The plan includes renovations to Harvard Stadium, the construction of a new basketball arena, and the development of a new Business School building.
This master plan will be be carried out concomitantly with two other Harvard development projects: a residential and retail development at the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue and a $1 billion science complex that will house the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Citing health problems, Menino announced in March that he would not be running for reelection this November. Menino, 70, has occupied the mayor’s office for 20 years, making his tenure the longest in Boston’s history.
During his time in office, Menino had appeared at forums for both College and Kennedy School students.
But, Joyce said, Menino is now “looking at other opportunities.”

Until a few days ago, the most fans looking forward to Sunday evening’s primetime NFL matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and Tennessee Titans thought that backup quarterback and Harvard alum Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 would be making his third-straight start for the Titans.
But Tennessee starter Jake Locker took snaps during the week and was cleared to play, giving the Harvard graduate the same view of the game as those of us sitting on couches back home—from the sidelines.
 
Fitzpatrick has certainly seen far more success in previous years than in this brief winless stint as a starter for the Titans. After throwing for at least 23 touchdowns and 3,000 yards in each of the past three seasons as the Buffalo Bills’ starter, he threw for two touchdowns and four interceptions, with all four turnovers in two losses against the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs.
 
2004 Ivy League MVP also fumbled the ball three times and has the fifth-worst quarterback rating in the NFL. Even with these statistics, there is a chance that Fitzpatrick will see some game time sometime this season—in his return to the lineup, Locker did not get into an offensive rhythm until the game was far out of reach. The Titans were shut out in the first three quarters, with Locker throwing an interception and failing to toss a score in those periods.
 
With Tennessee reeling after three straight losses, it may reevaluate the quarterback position with neither Fitzpatrick nor Locker doing much on offense. In Fitzpatrick’s most recent start against Seahawks, he threw for 171 yards on 17-of-29 passes with two interceptions, though he did rush for 33 yards on six attempts.

Harvard women’s ice hockey coach Katey Stone, in her newest gig as head coach of the USA national women’s hockey team, is off to a challenging start.
 
In their exhibition game against Canada, Team USA’s defense was slow to start, as three unanswered goals found the back of the net. Stone’s offense struggled to catch up the entire game.  
 
A solid comeback was not enough to propel the Americans to victory.  The Canadians took the win with a score of 3-2, and Stone registered her first loss as head coach.
 
The actual hockey aside, a memorable moment of the match was hands down the brawl that broke out in the third period, a wild episode that has been going viral on YouTube.  The fight broke out after a Canadian player delivered a hit to USA’s goalie, spurring a massive scuffle between the squads.
 
Stone and her team will have many chances for redemption as the Bring On the World tour kicks off, which is a series of exhibition games leading up to the Olympic competition in Sochi in February. The next major tournament for the Americans is the Four Nations Cup, which will be held November 5-9.  Stone and her team are hoping to revitalize women’s hockey in America with a powerful performance this Olympic year, and the Four Nations Cup will be the first stepping stone towards this goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We have hit the middle of October, and it is finally starting to feel like fall. The temperatures are dropping and the leaves are changing colors, making it very easy for you to tell which of your classmates are not from the New England area.
 
The middle of October also signifies the start of Ivy League play for many of the sports teams here at Harvard. Although the Crimson is diligently preparing for its most important stretch of the season, Harvard athletes have still found the time to keep us entertained through social media. So here you are: our favorite tweets from this week!
 
5. We start the countdown with a tweet from a former Crimson football player, sophomore Nick Allain, who still remains on our radar. And it appears that he has had a revelation.
 
“I know everybody feels like they sound just like the actual singer when they sing along a song but I sound just like timberlake no joke.”
 
Imagine where he’d be today if he didn’t choose football: “N.A. The 20/20 Experience.”
 
4. Destiny Nunley, a freshman forward on the women’s basketball team, is no stranger to social media…
 
“Nap time = lay in my bed, listen to music, creep on people on every social network possible for an hour.”
 
…Even if she’s not the one posting.
 
3. As a senior, one has to start thinking of prospective job opportunities after finishing school. John Rose, a senior on the lacrosse team, is wisely thinking ahead.
 
“If I was a boss anywhere my job interviews would consist of only one question: who do you play as in Mario Kart?”
 
Make sure to hire those who rely on the blue shell. If you ain’t first, you’re last.
 
2. According to recent developments, we may get to see a new look from junior forward Tommy O’Regan on the ice this year.
 
“Are dreadlocks a bigger commitment than marriage?”
 
We’ll let you decide, but needless to say, we at The Back Page are big fans of athletes making fashion statements.
 
1. Although the fall sports season is currently in the spotlight, the winter season is right around the corner. Crimson Madness was held at the Lavietes Pavillion Friday night, getting fans ready for the upcoming men’s basketball season. Siyani Chambers, a sophomore guard, had words for the fans that came out to support; and Cole Toner, a sophomore football player, has a prediction to make after getting his first look at the team.
 
“Thank you to all the fans that came out to crimson madness tonight! We appreciate the support! #teamharvard‬” –Chambers
 
“Don't look now, but @hoopsatharvard‬ is for real this year. Big, deep, and experienced. Im thinking at least Sweet 16” –Toner
 Key words: “at least.” The season is still a few weeks away, but we’re anticipating that “Crimson Madness” in October is just foreshadowing the “Crimson Madness” that we will see in March.

The Harvard Political Review released the Fiscal Year 2012 Annual Report of the U.S.A. last week, offering an analysis of the federal budget and challenges facing American spending policy.
 
Coincidentally, the report was published just hours before Congressional leaders announced that they had hammered out a deal to end the federal government shutdown, which began on October 1.
 
Flyby took a look at the numbers and decided that the best way to make sense of them was to put them in terms of three things we care about and think you probably do too—Ted Cruz, the Affordable Care Act, and the government shutdown.
 
ARUSA: As of January 2, 2013, the U.S. government held a total of $16.4 trillion in outstanding debt.Flyby: If Affordable Care Act naysayers protest the health exchange enough, it will only take about 173.8 billion people to opt out of healthcare, at a cost of $95 to each, to pay off the nation’s debt. Unfortunately, the United States’ population is less than 314 million. Though many immigration reform opponents are the same politicians who oppose the ACA, they could potentially pay off the national debt if they convinced enough people to immigrate to the US and then opt out of health care. Good luck.
 
ARUSA: This $16.4 trillion debt represents a 55 percent increase in gross debt in less than four years.Flyby: Meanwhile, Ted Cruz’s Political Action Committee raked in almost twice as much money in the quarter lasting from July 1 to Sept. 30 as it did in the previous quarter. Filibustering, it seems, is a lucrative endeavor.
 
ARUSA: The government owes more than $52,000 for every person living in the U.S., including children, the elderly, and the unemployed.Flyby: It would take Ted Cruz, with his annual salary of $174,000, about 91.5 million years to independently finance this reimbursement. Start filibustering, Senator.
 
ARUSA: The federal government accumulated a total deficit of $1.33 trillion in FY 2012.Flyby: This is approximately 54 times greater than the estimated cost of the government shutdown to the American economy. But it’s okay, because Ted Cruz pledged to donate his salary to charity for each day that the shutdown lasted, a total of roughly $7,800. Maybe if the shutdown lasted a little longer, Mr. Cruz could finance the debt reduction efforts.

Given the hundreds of emails you probably receive every day, you, like all of us here at Flyby, have probably noticed a disturbing trend. People suck at emailing. Too many emails these days are overly formal when addressed to a buddy, not formal enough for a professor, annoying, trite, or just downright rude. While we can’t even begin to fix all the things even you are (probably) doing wrong, we have come up with a few good places to start.
 
1. ExcusesDo not use them. Ever. Pretty simple, actually. Best case scenario, you look like you don’t care about the recipient enough; worst case scenario, they know that you’re lying (no, “I got held up at a Financial Analysts Club meeting” is not as clever as you think). Here’s a wild idea: just apologize like an adult for the late response and then get on with your email.
 
2. Signing Off“Sincerely,” and “Truly,” are great ways to close an email… if you hate fun and individualism that is. Instead, try the much more interesting “Later,” “Peace,” or (for more formal emails) something like “’Til next time, prof.” Alternately, “xoxo” is always a safe bet. Grandma, your roommate, or N. Gregory Mankiw, it doesn’t matter. Everyone likes a little affection.
 
P.S. Definitely don’t have “A.B. Candidate in X” in your email closing. You’re better than that. Tell your recipient literally anything else about yourself.
 
3. Subject LinesSubject lines are not nearly as necessary as you think. If your reader thinks that they learned everything about the email in that one line, what reason do they have to entertain the rest of it? Never use more than three words if a subject is necessary at all. Solid ground-rule: No verbs or articles. You get one or two nouns and one adjective. Do’s: “Quick Question,” “Naked Pics,” “Essay question”. Don’t's: “Professor, I just have a quick question about formatting for the essay”.

Many Harvard undergrads hail from the state that everyone seems to sneer at, defying the stereotypes that are attached to their beloved home. The Dirty Jerz has one of the worst reps around town, but here are five reasons why Jersey deserves some respect:
 
1) We are stronger than the storm. Hurricane Sandy wreaked devastation last autumn, tearing away the beloved boardwalk that spans Jersey’s gorgeous beaches. But that made no difference to the thousands of high school seniors who flocked to the shore anyway six months later for prom weekend. Nobody can stop the Jersey party, not even Sandy. 
2) The birthplace of Frank Sinatra, Derek Jeter, Queen Latifah, John Travolta, Whitney Houston, Anne Hathaway, Muhammad Ali, and Caroline Park. You are welcome.
3) We are legally barred from pumping our own gas. Which means sitting in a warm car as someone else braves the sleet/rain/snow outside to pump your gas. We know. We’re spoiled.
4) With just a short car/bus/train ride, we can visit all the awesome places in Philadelphia and New York… without having to live with all the congestion, smog, sky-high rent, and obnoxious city dwellers.
5) If you’ve ever met Jersey folk, you know they can put up one hell of a fight. The fight between New Jerseyans wishing to legalize same sex marriage, and those who wished for it to remain illegal recently came to a head. On Monday, October 21, 2013, New Jersey became the 14th state to legalize same sex marriage.
