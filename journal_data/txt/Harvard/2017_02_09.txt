After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re a heartbroken Sheerio, you can rest easy now that Ed Sheeran’s back. If, like many Americans, you don’t really care about anything he does, you can rest easy knowing that in a couple months you won’t have to hear about him for a while. But for now, Ed Sheeran is back and causing a lo-fi ruckus while he’s at it. Sheeran’s new video for “Castle on the Hill” is big news, with over 77 million views. The video has one central point: that Sheeran is better than all his childhood friends.
The video stars Sheeran himself, another teen who plays Young Sheeran, and an interchangeable group of teens straight out of “The Inbetweeners” who serve as his friends as he reflects on his childhood before he meets up with them in some random field. Young Sheeran plays the role of the storyteller of his friend group.  But rarely is Sheeran ever a central figure in any scene. He’s always a little distant from the group to show his maturity and future stardom—save for the scene where he’s having his first kiss while all his other friends creepily gawk at him, foreshadowing his life of a celebrity in a society that fetishizes it.
This is also true in Adult Sheeran’s scenes. Sheeran stares angstily away from the camera so that he highlights his new scar. That way, he can show all the struggles he went through to come out ahead of his friends. This is emphasized towards the end of the video when the camera pans on several friends’ faces as Sheeran sings about how all their lives suck, before Sheeran meets up with his ever-changing demographic of friends, now adults living sad lives, and graces them with his celebrity presence as the only person who “made it.”
The video tells the harrowing tale of a time when Sheeran was not rich and famous, but the video ends on a happy note as all of Sheeran’s more unfortunate friends stare in awe at this clearly exceptional being. It goes to show that if you’re just distant and hardworking enough, one day you too could grow up to be as superior as Ed Sheeran is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David Cox is, in a word, unexpected. As an Assistant Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and of Computer Science, his research walks a tight-rope on the blurred line between human cognition and computer computation. To see a man under 40 at the helm of such a lab, much less one with the build of a CrossFit Addict, is unexpected. But what is further unexpected is the structure of his most popular course—Molecular and Cellular Biology 81, Harvard’s intensive introduction to neuroscience. The course is taught in a “flipped” classroom style: Lectures are to be watched at home through a Massive Online Open Course Cox designed himself, and classroom time is for thorough, productive discussion. For this reason, enrollment is capped and competitive.
Sitting in a room of over 100 students vying for less than 30 seats, I remember vividly his assurance to us—that our background in biology did not matter, and that enrollment was not targeted towards students who had the most knowledge going in. I released a deep, thankful exhale. The last time I had taken biology was four years ago. And, as with most everything at Harvard, the familiar faces I saw in the classroom suggested that I was probably in the bottom half as far as qualifications were concerned.
After he dismissed this first sitting, I went up to ask him if I was, in fact, aiming for the correct course. His response echoed a sentiment that would have saved me a lot of anxiety as a high school senior: “We’re really just looking to take an academically diverse cohort, as that makes the most interesting discussion. You know, the more perspectives we can get coming in, the better off each student is coming out.”
As I’ve observed recent occurrences related to college admissions—the ongoing Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit against Harvard, the infamous University of Texas Bake Sale, the several messages I’ve recently received from friends back home irate over being denied a seat in their first choice schools—I am reminded of this conversation.
The reason affirmative action and race-conscious admissions as a whole have survived the test of time (and several Supreme Court cases) is because universities have a compelling interest in the benefits they provide to their student bodies. Yet, for many, affirmative action is still labeled as “unfair”.
This is likely because, for many Americans, college admissions appear to be a process of validation. Those who are “best” should be taken and made better. On its face, this makes some sense. This argument favors the concept of perceived meritocracy, especially if one believes (despite significant well-published experimental and statistical evidence to the contrary) that in America today racism, socio-economic status, and other factors do not create discrepancies in opportunity. However, even if we somehow pretend these do not exist, validation still is not how we should think of college admissions.
College admissions should be understood in the same way Professor Cox structures his course: outcome-first. What is important to colleges is, and has always been, producing the best class of graduates from a given pool of applicants. Modern college admissions processes reflect this.
As such, support for holistic, diversity-conscious college admissions is not just socially and morally right for applicants; it is a proven necessity for graduates. It is irrefutable that exposure to different backgrounds produces varying, fresh perspectives. Additionally, racial diversity has been shown to play upon ways we instinctively and unknowingly discriminate in order to create better results. Being confronted by people who don’t look like us encourages us to consider our thoughts and arguments more thoroughly. Thus campuses that are assuredly diverse, in every sense, produce better graduates—not just because students engaged in novel conversations, or because they empathetically broadened their perspectives, but because they worked harder to explain themselves, and they thought critically about their assumptions.
For some, this view of college admissions can be frustrating. After years of working their hardest to get into their dream school, some applicants are edged out by people they believe are less qualified than them. This seems unfortunate, but in the end, these applicants benefit too. Colleges exist to produce members of our society who will further us in science, commerce, the arts, and many other domains, and so it is the output, and not the input, that counts. It isn’t just that we all end up better when colleges look to the future, either—the students who were edged out at one school will have learned and grown more because they were members of a vibrant community at a different school that cared deeply about the cohort into which the student entered.
For those in the application process now, remember: It is understandably easy to confuse something that is competitive with it being selectively validating. When the stakes are high, it is easy to confuse “accepted” with “worthy”. Yet, college admissions officers cannot validate your existence or your accomplishments. None claim to do so, either. Thankfully, this also means they cannot invalidate these things. Admissions officers are there to build communities, not to sanctify individuals. You are so much more than what you’ve placed on your applications, anyways. There is a place for you out there, and take pride in the fact that your presence there will be valuable in creating a community of diverse voices.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust has taken an important step in addressing financial accessibility in her recent announcement to raise the issue of rising textbook costs at an upcoming faculty meeting in March. We commend Faust on her decision to address an issue that, for many students, can greatly influence their education at the College. However, the dialogue on economic barriers to taking courses cannot stop at the faculty meeting. Administrators and faculty alike must continue the conversation about the challenges that textbooks and other course materials pose to financially disadvantaged students, and support any new developments put forward.
For many students, textbooks represent an insurmountable challenge limiting freedom in educational choice. In recent years, students have admitted to making decisions on classes on the basis of whether or not they can afford required textbooks, and making trade-offs between purchasing a textbook or buying other, needed items.
Both administrators and faculty must work to increase textbook access for all Harvard students and alleviate this economic barrier. On the administrative end, the College should adopt a more holistic role in helping financially disadvantaged students afford course materials. We commend the College’s financial aid packages that empower many students, giving them the right to pursue their education, and placing Harvard at the forefront of accessibility among its peer institutions. Nevertheless, given the generosity of Harvard’s financial aid, accompanied by the magnanimous claim that “financial circumstances...will not keep you from Harvard,” it is illogical that textbook prices should stand in the way of students’ course selections.
We  have previously opined on the need for a more comprehensive, all-encompassing financial aid program that could factor in the cost of textbooks and other course materials into the cost of tuition. Currently, such costs are included under the category of personal expenses, and are not covered by financial aid, but rather by student contributions, which are often made up by students through term-time work. It is counterintuitive that Harvard expects students to work to pay for their textbooks: the more students work to pay for them, the less time they have to dedicate to putting said books to use.
Furthermore, professors should collaborate with the Harvard Library to increase accessibility to required textbooks in all courses, through making more copies of textbooks available on reserve at Lamont and other libraries and making them accessible online. Additionally, the existing  three hour time frame allotted for reserve checkouts is often limiting for students, as many courses assign reading requiring longer than three hours. An extension of the three hour reserve time could provide another way students who may not have the financial freedom to purchase a textbook can use course materials through the Harvard Library with greater benefit. A combination of making more textbooks available on reserve for all classes, in addition to potentially extending the amount of time such books could be taken out, could prove useful aides for lower income students.
Harvard is an expensive institution, both inside and out, and Harvard administrators and faculty must take greater responsibility in ensuring that all students can achieve the education for which they came here. While we applaud the developments made thus far, we hope further steps are made so that Harvard students can spend their time at the College to the fullest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Always wear cute pajamas to bed; you never know who you’ll meet in your dreams.”
I painted that quote on a canvas last summer, and now it’s hanging up by my bed. While visiting my room, some of my friends have eyed this quote with disdain. To them, the message it conveys  seems silly, too “girly”, and even anti-feminist. Why would I allow my clothing choices to be dictated by my hopes of attracting a man? Am I implying that women’s bodies exist solely for the enjoyment of men? How can I be a feminist and care about how men view me?
I have two responses to these accusations. First off, reread the quote. Where does it say anything about a man? Don’t make assumptions.
And second, there’s nothing wrong with a woman dressing a certain way to attract potential partners. Using your looks to exert autonomy over your sexuality can be incredibly empowering. The real problem lies in women feeling obligated to cater their appearances towards others’ wishes, even when they don’t want to. But if a girl willingly chooses to wear makeup or put on a special outfit in the hopes of catching someone’s eye, she should be proud of her decision. It’s her body, and she should be able to decide how to present herself without feeling ashamed of how she might be perceived as anti-feminist.
Female empowerment can take many different forms, and women shouldn’t feel like they have to defy traditionally feminine stereotypes in order to be “good” feminists. Feminists are often thought of as having to be career-oriented, incredibly assertive, and uninterested in more “traditional” activities like cooking or knitting. But the truth is, anyone can be a feminist, and you don’t have to wear a pantsuit everyday or throw out your apron to make the cut. In fact, ranking “girlier” traits as inferior and undesirable reinforces the idea that there’s something inherently weak about being a woman, which feeds back into sexist stereotypes that only serve to demean women.
A woman’s power lies in her ability to choose. It’s not what she decides to do, but rather that she has the autonomy to make her own decisions. She should embrace this power by making choices that enable her to live her best life, whether they fit gender stereotypes or not.
Some women wear makeup to attract potential partners, and that’s just as valid as wearing makeup solely to feel beautiful in it. Moreover, some women choose to not wear any makeup, and that’s valid, too. A woman climbing the corporate ladder deserves just as much respect and recognition as a woman who stays home to manage her household. A woman doing construction work is just as powerful as a woman working in a bakery. A woman who breastfeeds is just as capable as a woman who chooses to feed her baby with a bottle. Long hair is just as great as short hair. Hot pink heels and a floral dress can be just as empowering as a blazer.
We need to stop judging women for the valid choices that they make about their own lives. Not only is it condescending and disrespectful, but it’s also directly opposed to the values of feminism. True feminism lifts people up and encourages them to live freely and authentically, not to hide their true selves in an effort to break stereotypes and be  “good” feminists. Moreover, all true feminists have a duty to extend this philosophy to all, regardless of their race, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other trait.
There’s not one way to be a woman, so choose what fits you best at any given time. Some nights, I’ll don my leather jacket and knee-high black boots to go out for a night of independent badassery. Other nights, I’ll put on my brightest red lipstick and a soft pink A-line dress, hoping to impress a special someone. Or maybe I’ll wear that same pink dress to be an independent badass, because screw your gender stereotypes.
And when I return home from my nighttime escapades, I’ll open my dresser drawer, reach past my boring oversized t-shirts, and pull out my cloud-printed shirt and pants set. I’ll feel the gentle surge of power pulse through me as I slide on my cute pajamas and slip into dreams of Mrs. Right.  No one can take that power away from me.

It’s no secret that Harvard students have a lot to look forward to in life. But nothing puts the tickle in a Harvard student’s pickle quite like seeing an unread email from the Undergraduate Council in their inbox. This is certainly the case with UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18’s masterfully composed Jan. 26 email, “Re: Back at it.” Through its immeasurable range of rhetorical chutzpah, “Re: Back at it” sends readers on an electrifying odyssey through the brilliant literary minds behind Harvard’s student government.
Yaz and Cam’s email begins modestly: “Dear Harvard.” Through the use of metonymy, Yaz and Cam address Harvard students not on an individual basis, but as a combined whole—an academic gestalt, if you will—while introducing the motif of unity that is developed later in the email. Yaz and Cam’s choice of the word “dear” should also not be overlooked; “dear,” considered a traditional greeting by most scholars of the epistolary arts, suggests a rather conventionalist attitude towards the political tenor of the new Undergraduate Council administration. Yaz and Cam are not looking to change Harvard’s existing institutions any time soon.
The email then encourages Harvard students to have an enjoyable and productive shopping week. Yaz and Cam follow their unassuming statement with the claim that the secret to achieving success is “always Hebrew Bible.” In the most literal sense, this phrase seems to allude to “Culture and Belief 23: The Hebrew Bible,” a class taught by Professor Shaye J. D. Cohen with an overall Q-score of 4.1. Given this above-average rating, it would only make sense that one’s enrollment in The Hebrew Bible would indeed elicit “as smooth a start as possible” to this semester. But don’t be fooled: “Hebrew Bible” is an adianoetic euphemism for the Old Testament of the Judeo-Christian scripture, a virtual “Hallelujah!” meant to subliminally infuse flavors of piety and spiritual fervor into Yaz and Cam’s otherwise secular message.
Perhaps most striking is the bolded, center-aligned phrase, “So. let’s. [sic] hit. [sic] the. [sic] ground. [sic] running. [sic]” Much can be said about this single sentence unconventionally broken up into six one-word sentences that have no individual meaning whatsoever. Placing a period in between every single word, Yaz and Cam ingeniously transform the hackneyed idiom “hit the ground running” into something art nouveau, deconstructivist with a rococo twist, palatable to even the most finicky of readers.
Further down in the message is a Graphics Interchange Format—(or GIF)—of the famous training scene from the 1979 blockbuster film “Rocky II,” captioned, “live feed of tercentenary theater @ 9:06 a.m.” Many readers may initially become confused, and with good reason. One may notice, for example, that the GIF features the title character, Rocky, running in front of the Philadelphia skyline in broad daylight, whereas the very same Philadelphia skyline is only visible from Tercentenary Theater during the full moon. How, then, could this possibly be a live feed of Tercentenary Theater? Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that Yaz and Cam are purposely deceiving readers using a technique known as humor; the stark differences between the two images—sweaty Harvard students running in Tercentenary Theater and sweaty people who are not Harvard students running in a location that is not Tercentenary Theater—are designed to release the reader from the hypnotic allure of mass media, calling into question the didactic certainties of the so-called “live feed.”
“Re: Back at it” ends just as abruptly as it begins, this time with a cryptic mathematical expression representing the sum of the two authors’ names: “Yaz + Cam.” What can this possibly mean? One can only assume that Yaz and Cam intend this expression to remain unanswered and open to interpretation. But it doesn’t take an Applied Mathematics concentrator to know that Yaz + Cam = pure literary genius.

Through the phone, my dad tells me that the surge of confidence he felt after acquiring an American passport cannot be put into words. For him, it symbolized an unbelievable hope: that if you work hard and follow the law, one fine day you might become a citizen of the Greatest Country In The World,™ entitled to its full protection and recognition before the law.
I once viewed such thinking as idealistic, ignorant of the founding oppression propping up those ideals. I worried that such statements were overly performative, that they stemmed from a common worry among new Americans that criticism of country will be perceived as unpatriotic.
Now, scrolling through my newsfeed, I watch videos of protesters cheering at airports in Boston, Cleveland, or Dallas. Videos of friends, sisters, and spouses reunited and professing their renewed belief in these ideals—and they move me. When I ask my dad for more detail, he tells me that it is the specific freedoms of a private citizen—freedom from fear (of deportation), from constraint, from voicelessness—that inspire such confidence and hope.
I once thought, rather cynically, that being American meant lost mother tongues, a disconnect from the landscape (that was never ours to begin with), isolated dwelling in suburban Georgia or Minnesota or Texas or—if you’re lucky—diverse, bustling cities.
I thought that American citizenship was commodity and immigration law was transaction. We are stunned by countries, such as Malta and Cyprus, that barter citizenship to the wealthy, but right here in the USA you can purchase a permanent residency for a set price. Millions compete in the “Green-Card Lottery” for a mere 50,000 spots.
A few weeks ago, it was reported that Wole Soyinka, Nobel Prize-winning writer and activist, had followed through with his pledge to renounce, and physically destroy, his Green Card if Donald Trump won the presidential election. My dad dismissed this action as radical “but courageous.” But according to The Atlantic, it was more than just a theatrical exercise in radicalism. In terminating his path to citizenship, Soyinka says, he “delivered [him]self from uncertainty, from discomfort, from internal turmoil.”
Soyinka’s plan was to return to Abeokuta, the Nigerian city where he grew up, to join in solidarity with what he called “the colony of outsiders,” the expanding group of people that emerging nationalism in the US and Europe seeks to exclude. It’s hard for me to put into words how much I share that desire to return to somewhere else (to where, I don’t know, as the U.S. is my only home).
My dad, on the other hand, tells me he still firmly believes in the viability of the American project, that going “back home” is not an option. “The U.S. is a beacon,” he says. “I don’t know how else to say it.”
And it remains a beacon of light for him—despite the fact that almost every week since the election, before driving to work, he has wiped down his car after someone decorates it with smashed eggshells and yolk. No one in our family agrees on the exact intention of the vandalism, which identity it means to denigrate, or whether the vandals’ motivations are political or personal.
My brother and I want to catch them in the act, but my dad warns against this. He refuses to notify the police (“we never involve them”), installing cameras and a new alarm system instead, not to trap and turn them in as my brother and I encourage—he would never do that—but for something else. I think he’s keeping watch, waiting for some sort of an understanding, keeping the porch light on as his own private beacon.

On Saturday, Feb. 4, dozens of warm-spirited people gathered in Brattle Square wearing bright neon hats, earbuds, and their coziest layers to kick off a “silent disco.” Silent discos are a relatively new phenomenon in which participants tune into the same playlist, dancing together in public to the music that their earbuds share. Meanwhile, uninvolved passersby are left bemused by the illusion of silence.
From Brattle Square, the group of about 50 dancers grooved their way through JFK Park, Harvard Stadium, and a playground. They paraded over Anderson Bridge and concluded the festivities in a small, concrete building in Allston. Here, participants finally removed their earbuds and jammed out to a live DJ. Dancers let loose inside, enjoying refreshments provided by Whole Foods and other local sponsors.
Lily Wang—an entrepreneur and one of the co-producers of the popular, morning, alcohol-free dance party called Daybreaker in Boston—organized the entire event from start to finish. When Wang came up with the idea for a mid-winter silent disco, she was able to quickly enlist an army of devoted volunteers. “It’s all about conscious partying,” Wang says. “Seasonal affective disorder is real.”

The disco was made possible by a smartphone application called EchoMe, which allowed users to simultaneously listen in on a shared stream of music. Christian Nicholson, a recent graduate of Boston College who created the app, led the parade of dancers by example with his smooth, quirky-cool-techie dance style.
“[Music] literally, physically moves people,” Nicholson said. “It has the power to build communities, and that’s what we’re all about. We’re a live discovery music application… focused on real-time connectivity.”
For Saturday’s disco, Nicholson connected with local DJ Tonis. The playlist featured  a myriad of modern styles, but every song had one thing in common: danceability.
But the event itself was so much more than just a platform for sharing music. The experience made silently rocking out to your favorite songs perfectly acceptable—even encouraged. By the time we got to the final party, the energy was so overwhelming and contagious that we’d all worked up an absolute drench of a sweat.
On my walk back to  Harvard, I played a dancey song by Downtown Boys. The slow traffic on the Anderson Bridge got a great view of me skipping and shimmying unashamedly by myself.

The intrepid, mop-wielding, toilet-scrubbing students who form the rank and file of Dorm Crew have their roots in the Student Porter Program, introduced to the college in 1950.
Before that, student dormitory upkeep was not conducted by the residents themselves, but rather by a maid service. These maids, alternatively monikered “sweeps,” “biddies,” (a diminutive for the name Bridget that became a colloquial name for a maid) and “goodies,” were considered a staple of the Harvard College experience.  In late 1950, university officials anticipated that the maids would soon demand higher wages and proposed the more economical Student Porter Program.
Despite the fact that Harvard was one of the few colleges that still provided a maid service for its residential students, the proposal was met with mixed reactions. It certainly didn’t help that the University coupled the effective downgrade in cleaning services with a 15 percent price hike to student rent. As one Crimson editor put it in an unattributed article from 1951, the “loss of the 9 a.m. cheeriness and relatively conscientious work of the maids is an unhappy prospect.”
The program got off to a rocky start. It took the campus some time to adjust to student porters odd cleaning hours. A survery conducted by The Crimson reported the qualms of Dunster House residents, who cited the “degrading social stigma” associated with the job, as well as the “irregularity” and “attitude” of the porters as reason for their discontent.
In response, porters waged a passive-aggressive war. Porters would occasionally use “intentional by-pass strategies... forgetting or neglecting critical areas.” One porter recounted cleaning off glass shelves and not putting the articles back in place, as well as sprinkling water on toilet seats and rolls of tissue. Copies of Playboys and Penthouses found in bathrooms were tossed into the trash.
By 1951, the “Council’s Porter Committee” had worked out most of the kinks. Appreciating the opportunity for student employment, campus opinion of the program grew steadily.
Some awkward moments remained. In a 1976 Crimson article, an anonymous porter recalled “the morning he knocked, no answer, and entered, to find a couple obviously not expecting him, the girl screamed, the guy gurgled forth obscenities and the student porter dove into friendly porcelain territory locking the door behind him.”
In June of 1979, the Student Porter Program, now called Dorm Crew, made its way into the spotlight, when several Dorm Crew members who were cleaning out a room in Winthrop House discovered three letters written by none other than Robert F. Kennedy ’44. The letters were turned into the Dorm Crew supervisor as objects of interest.
The supervisor promptly graduated and returned home to Malaysia. Todd C. Hennis ‘82, an old Dorm Crew member, said in The Crimson in 1979 that he was “pretty sure” he remembers going with the supervisor to turn in the letters to the House superintendent, but the superintendent had no such memory. The letters, which Hennis described as full of “all the innocuous drivel one writes home to one’s parents,” were never seen again.
While these occasional moments of discovery and intrigue can make the history of Dorm Crew seem like an Indiana Jones movie, the organization has also suffered through its darker patches. Bonny Landers ‘77, one of the first women to clean on Dorm Crew, recounted her early cleaning experience in a 1976 Crimson article. The resident of the first room she was assigned to clean simply closed the door in her face, and even after students caught on to the fact that she was providing them with a helpful service, “five or six guys would stand around and watch [her] as [she] worked.”
Today Dorm Crew advertises on its website that more than 20 percent of recent Harvard graduates have spent at least a little time in its employ during their stay on campus. Once stigmatized and controversial, the program has spent 60 years evolving into the campus institution it is today.

“Going here makes me feel so old,” my friend lamented.
“Why?” I asked, chewing my milk tea’s pearls carefully.
I glanced around the room, suddenly self-conscious of my familiar routine. We were sitting in T4, a local boba shop, after returning to Dublin, California, from our third semester in college.
“I don’t know,” she said. “There’s just no one here I recognize anymore.”
Sometime between my junior and senior years of high school, boba culture in Dublin exploded. For as long as I can remember, Quickly (famous for its fried octopus) and Cafe Tapioca (great for post-bowling drinks) had been the only two contenders in town. But then T4 opened, redefining our town’s boba shop aesthetic with its teal color scheme and metallic straws. Then i-Tea joined forces with a froyo store in a local outlet mall. Then Sharetea opened up near a swanky hot pot restaurant. Before I knew it, five boba places, each with its own distinct culture, dotted my tiny city.
Energy buzzed behind T4’s glass doors. Almost every time I went, I saw someone I knew—an acquaintance from a neighboring city, the girl who sat next to me in AP Literature, a former classroom mom. We would make small talk or just yell out each other’s names. It was fun. It was home.
In the summer, I spent late nights of good conversation and fried tofu there. I would text someone to hang out, and we would drive to T4 under the cold glow of streetlamps, K-Pop blasting through the car’s speakers. At the store, we would sit at a table and go through the motions of an old refrain.
“Are you going to get something?”
“No, I thought you wanted something.”
As cheesy as this sounds, we didn’t go for the milk tea. We went for each other. The out-of-season Christmas lights gave the store a charm that made it feel homey. The polo-wearing employees granted us a feeling of security. And the bustle of the place—the loud chatter of teenagers relaying the day’s gossip and frustrations—promised anonymity. It was the stuff Harvard study breaks can only dream of.
When a friend of mine moved to South Korea recently, she mentioned T4 boba runs as markers of her California childhood. And when she came to visit over winter break, we reunited at T4. We hugged and laughed and punctured our drinks’ plastic with oversized straws.
We noticed a group of kids outside the store. “How old do you think they are?” my friend nudged my shoulder.
“Probably...eighth grade?” They had cocky, lopsided smiles and baby fat on their faces. Two perched on the edge of an open car trunk holding multicolored drinks, their plastic covers fraying around the edges. They had a kind of hopefulness that the course load of high school and the advent of adult acne slowly kill.
“Definitely middle school,” she agreed. One kid lifted his face towards the sun. I imagined he was relishing in the feeling of belonging.
“Definitely.” As 19-year-olds, we were older than the average T4 patron. But we weren’t old enough to go anywhere else.
I didn’t want to be one of those college students trying to relive the glory days of high school—those were nonexistent for me, anyway. But I didn’t want to let go of the nostalgia either. T4 was where I went after school, my morale beaten down by seven hours of classes. It was where I struggled to keep Jenga towers intact, the store’s set always suspiciously sticky. It was more than lychee jelly, earl gray milk tea, and tapioca. It was part of what made my hometown a home.
The child inside of me has begrudgingly let go of stuffed animals, Club Penguin, and lack of responsibility—all the while screaming “I don’t want to grow up! I don’t want to grow up!” But it won’t budge on this. I have something good, and I won’t trade it for the facade of maturity.
When I return to Dublin for spring break, I know exactly where I’m going first.

On National Coming Out Day, 2006, the Harvard Dorm Crew office was divided. One of the two staffers was excited. The other, Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, was not.
“Doesn’t a day like this put undue pressure on people to come out before they’re ready?” Scarborough asked. The staffer shrugged. “Straight guys just don’t get it.”
“I’m not straight. I’m gay,” Scarborough replied, nervous.
“No, you’re not,” said the staffer. “Really?”
“Really.”
It was the first time that Scarborough, then a junior at Harvard College, had told anyone the truth about his sexuality. As part of a conservative Christian family, and a devout Christian himself, he’d spent much of his early life struggling to reconcile his sexuality with a “very conservative” religious upbringing.
“I spent a lot of time resisting the idea of being gay,” Scarborough reflects.
Exactly 10 years later, on Oct. 11, 2016, Scarborough recounted his coming-out story in a sermon for Memorial Church Morning Prayers. No longer a nervous, closeted college junior, Scarborough had become an outspoken advocate for BGLTQ students.
Today, he uses his personal story to connect with them: “I have found that when students know that I identify as gay, [it] helps them see me as a potential resource and ally for coming out, or starting that journey,” Scarborough says. At the time of the sermon, Scarborough had recently been named the Interim Director of BGLTQ Student Life. On Feb. 6, 2017, he became the permanent Director.
The position comes with a short history marked by frequent change.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life has appointed three different directors in just five years. It’s occupied two different locations (with plans in motion for a move to a third). It’s grown and expanded, becoming rapidly more ambitious in its goals.
Scarborough is similarly ambitious: He aims to make the Office of BLGTQ Student Life (colloquially known as the “Quoffice”) more intersectional, “expanding the notion of what a BGLTQ student looks like, what they believe, how they operate in the world.” As part of that goal, he wants to create spaces for students to reconcile their faith and sexuality. He hopes also to connect with students who may not be out—at home, at Harvard, or both.
“Honestly, this is a large part of why I took this position: To really encourage and support and help students who are at all stages of acceptance or experiencing and exploring their BGLTQ identity,” Scarborough says.
He remembers hesitating to participate in BGLTQ life as an undergraduate. “There were times I wanted to plug into the community, I wanted to go to a dance, or I wanted to know what was going on on campus, but there were a lot of barriers for a lot of reasons,” Scarborough says. “Some of that related to family, some of that related to—for me at least—not feeling comfortable with what was… a burgeoning acceptance of an identity.”
Before Scarborough took over the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, he was a student who could have used it.
LEAVING  HOME  BASE
When Scarborough talks about his work, he brings up his childhood.
Though he was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Scarborough grew up in Abington, a suburb just outside the city. His parents, who didn’t attend college, had moved the family for the better educational opportunities Abington offered.
But for Scarborough, the move also meant being the only black student in his predominantly white elementary school, a transition he describes as “jarring.” It was hard, he says “coming from being around family and friends, where there’s a sense of a shared culture, a shared being.”
Instead, Scarborough and his family found community back where they had started, centering their lives on an evangelical Christian church in the Philadelphia city proper. Scarborough’s grandparents lived “just around the corner,” and his immediate family attended services every Sunday. He describes that area of Philadelphia—Germantown—as “home base.”
Scarborough found his church to be at once comforting and challenging, a place where he made most of his friends growing up, but also where he felt fundamentally out of place. “I was kind of an unusual, weird kid,” he says. “I was unlike most of my friends at church, most of my friends at school.”
A classical music-lover, Scarborough would memorize Bach and “play” it from memory in his head when he didn’t have access to a recording. He was poetically-inclined, too, and his creative side caught the eye of high school teachers who recognized potential.
“As people took an interest in me, which I’m very grateful for, a lot of opportunities opened up that may not have otherwise,” Scarborough says.
One of those opportunities, of course, was Harvard.
He began his time in Cambridge cleaning bathrooms as part of the Fall Clean-Up freshman pre-orientation program run by Dorm Crew. Scarborough’s mother had encouraged him to sign-up, saying he “was a naturally neat person anyway.”
Scarborough continued working for Dorm Crew throughout his college career.  Later, he would be named one of the head captains. He describes Dorm Crew as one of the most significant parts of his college experience.
“Like I said, it was about the discipline, and a way to earn money, which I really needed, but also a great group of friends and a great social environment for me,” he says.
Though not an athlete in high school, he became a reliable team-member in intramural sports for Hollis Hall, his freshman dormitory. “Sheehan had this wonderful quality of being willing to try new things, and he’s so talented that he just picks up anything that he happens to try,” says Farhang Heydari ’06, who lived across the hall from Scarborough and later became his roommate in Dunster House.
Heydari recounts a time when he and Scarborough agreed to round out a team for an intramural basketball game. Ten minutes into the game, Scarborough accidentally bumped into a female friend on the court,  knocking her to the ground.
“He was just mortified over the whole thing because Sheehan is the nicest, most gentle soul you’ll ever meet,” Heydari says, laughing. “It turned out fine, we’re all still friends to this day, but that’s the last time I can remember Sheehan playing basketball.”
Off the court, Scarborough studied government. Inspired by the fallout after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the American military engagement in the Middle East that followed, he sought to understand foreign policy conflicts at a deeper level.
“I knew that I was very interested in the history of that region and the quote unquote religious conflict,” Scarborough says. “[I wanted] to understand how that had come to be, and to be part of whatever peace movement could come from it.” Scarborough and his friends, most of whom studied government or international relations as well, would stay up late into the night debating America’s role in foreign engagements.
Harvard also provided Scarborough with an opportunity for self-reflection. He was on his own for the first time, and spent much of his first three years on campus struggling to find himself. “I had more space to think about being gay, to think about these tensions [between religion and sexuality],” he says. “Something started to unravel a bit, and I think that unraveling was productive in the long-term, but in the moment it was challenging.”
During that time, Scarborough felt too uncomfortable to express his sexuality publicly. “I just wasn’t at a point, until very late in my college career, to feel comfortable doing that, or even feel that that was something beneficial to me,” he says. He found himself facing “dark days” as he tried to make sense of what he perceived to be two incompatible identities.
“It’s a remarkable disjunction that winds up festering inside your soul if you can’t reconcile different aspects of your identity,” Scarborough says. “For me, that was religion and sexuality.”
During his senior year, Scarborough came out. Doing so changed his life.
He felt more visible, more seen. He met someone he was interested in. He opened up to other BGLTQ students about his struggles, and they opened up to him. He gained a new sense of self-confidence. Scarborough had found a community he never thought he would, and he loved it.
“Sexuality is sexuality, and it’s an important part of the human experience, but before senior year, it wasn’t part of my experience,” Scarborough says. “But I learned so much that year.”
He did so, however, without any institutional support. During Scarborough’s time as an undergraduate, BGLTQ life at Harvard was student-organized. Queer groups hosted parties, organized events, and helped to connect BGLTQ students with one another. However, there was no university-run institution devoted to queer issues for not-out or questioning students.
“I think students at this point can almost take for granted that there is a BGLTQ Office at all, because every undergraduate here has only been here when that office has existed,” he says. “I remember a time when there wasn’t any office.”
‘GOING BACK INTO THE CLOSET’
On Sunday, Sept. 12, 2010, an unidentified male Harvard student was walking down Garden Street from the Radcliffe Quadrangle when three men began following him and harassing him with homophobic slurs. Eventually, they chased him into a nearby side street, and demanded his wallet and phone. The student, fortunately, escaped the situation physically unharmed.
The incident was labeled a hate crime.
At the time, Harvard was the only Ivy League university without either an institutional BGLTQ resource center or a paid, full-time BGLTQ coordinator. Instead, the only BGLTQ support on campus was centered around the Queer Resource Center (QRC), a privately-funded student-run organization located in the basement of Thayer Hall.
Soon, students rallied for an expansion of space allotted to the office.  In a Crimson article from 2010, Elizabeth C. Elrod ’11 said the QRC was so small that holding meetings there was like “going back into the closet.”
One month later, though not directly in response to those incidents, then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds convened a working group on BGLTQ Student Life. The working group was comprised of students, administrators, and faculty. After meeting regularly between Oct. 2010 and March 2011, it submitted a final report
Recommendation number one: Hire a full-time Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
The following September, the College announced the appointment of Lisa “Lee” Forest to the position of Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, but on Oct. 29, 2011—just three days before she was set to begin—Forest turned down the job for “personal and professional reasons.”
Emily J. Miller, now the Title IX Coordinator for Harvard College but then a member of the working group, was named Interim Coordinator of the new office. “It was a little disappointing that we were without a full-time director,” Miller says. “But I really valued that experience and I’m so grateful for the students who helped get the office off the ground that year.”
Then, in July of 2012, Van Bailey was named the first permanent director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life. The position was filled, over a year after it was created. One of the first people Bailey would work with would be Scarborough.
‘AN ABOUT TIME’
By 2010, just three years after his graduation, Scarborough had returned to Harvard to study at the Divinity School. The move was motivated by questions he still had about himself. “I’ve never been able to reconcile my whole religious identity with my other identities, and Divinity School was an opportunity to explore some of why that was,” Scarborough says.
Troubled by a feeling of “deep melancholy” associated with his religious background, Scarborough sought to make sense of his situation through study of the Bible. “I wanted to be able to wield the sword that had been wielded against me, but not wield it against anyone else,” Scarborough says, pausing for a moment. “I think reclaiming is a good way of putting it.”
While studying at the Divinity School, Scarborough worked as a freshman proctor and residential advisor in Hollis, Holworthy, and Pennypacker Halls. Over the seven years he has worked as a proctor since, Scarborough has earned a reputation for being thoughtful and caring.
“He immediately made me feel comfortable,” says Mattie M. Newman ’17, who lived in Scarborough’s entryway during her freshman year. For Newman, who at first had trouble with the transition to life at Harvard, Scarborough became a one-man support system. Over time, he helped her realize that her background—one marked by a  small town, a lower income, and medical issues—was a strength rather than a weakness. “I remember when he was introducing himself to us he said he was a tall, black, gay man who was a student at the Divinity School… He really owned himself,” Newman says. “I think he projected that onto all of his students.”
During his first year as a proctor, Scarborough noticed students who struggled to reconcile their faith and sexuality and decided to address this unmet need. Together with Julie A. Rogers, his classmate at the Divinity School, fellow freshman proctor, and Memorial Church Seminarian, Scarborough founded the “Faith and Sexuality Initiative,” which sought to provide support, events, and advice for students who felt a challenging tension between their religious identities and their sexual ones. “We both had heard a lot of students who identified as BGLTQ who… felt really rejected by their faith traditions, but also were still really longing for [one],” Rogers says.
“A lot of times if you’re a religious person, there’s a sense that going into a queer space you have to leave your religion at the door, and vice versa,” Scarborough says. “We wanted to both explore why that is and give people an opportunity to think and feel and experience religious services that are [also] geared towards [the BGLTQ community].”
Rogers describes Scarborough as a “wonderful collaborator,” and says that he provided an invaluable service to students who had previously gone unheard. “I have not found anyone in my life who is as sensitive and I think trustworthy as Sheehan,” she says. “He really, really cared about the students, and brought a lot of counseling skills, a lot of gentleness, to the work of the Faith and Sexuality Initiative.”
The Initiative often worked out of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life in Boylston Hall. Scarborough would use it when students wanted to talk to someone privately. “The partnership with the BGLTQ office was an important [one] so that [the Faith and Sexuality Initiative] could have a broader impact,” Scarborough says.
THE OFFICE  IN TRANSITION 
As Interim Director, Scarborough returned to work at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life at its temporary home of 7 Linden Street.
The office left its original home in Boylston last year, and now shares a space with the Bureau of Study Counsel until renovation of the basement of Grays Hall is finished. Once completed, Grays will be the permanent home to both the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, one of the other offices under the broad umbrella of the Office of Student Life. Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair says the hope is to have the project completed in the fall of 2017.
This geographic transition for the Office of BGLTQ Student Life comes as the broader Office of Student Life changes its staff. O’Dair started as head of the Office of Student Life in August, after the departure of former Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde early last year. Emelyn A. dela Peña, the former assistant dean for equity, diversity, and inclusion, left her post this past October, and the search for her replacement is still ongoing.
Scarborough sees this time as a moment of opportunity for the Office of BGLTQ Student Life. He wants to build on past successes while also responding to the changing needs of BGLTQ students at the College.
Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19, a Crimson Editorial Columnist, says he would like to see more of a focus on intersectionality as the Office of BLGTQ Student Life moves forward in assessing students’ needs. “It’s okay if right now, for example, the Quoffice just doesn’t know what queer black people or queer people from working class families need,” he says. “But [they should be] opening themselves up to having those conversations and thinking about how to tailor events to fit those identities.
Scarborough shares Whittaker’s concerns. “I think this is absolutely an opportunity to reframe. I want to make sure, first, that we know what all the needs are,” Scarborough says.  “[So that] whatever we are reframing, whatever we are moving forward to do, it is connected back to serving the student population.”
Scarborough plans to increase the office’s work in the College’s residential communities, which he says have a unique opportunity to provide support for BGLTQ students that his office does not.
“I think in many ways the residential experience is the crux of the Harvard experience - it’s what makes Harvard, Harvard,” he says. “Because not only are you taking classes, but you’re actually living and learning with students from all walks of life and backgrounds. [We] know that students don’t always come to [the Office of BGLTQ Student Life].”
To that end, Scarborough is planning to meet with residential proctors and tutors to discuss ways they can support students who may be struggling with issues related to their sexuality. “We are a locus of expertise, we are a locus of support, and a center for BGLTQ student life,” he says. “It’s our job to make sure that anyone in a position to support students has [that] competency as well.”
For Scarborough, proper support for students means recognizing this diversity of needs among BGLTQ students. “Through my work on the Faith and Sexuality Initiative, it was abundantly clear to me that BGLTQ identities cross every intersection there is,” he says.
As director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, Scarborough hopes to reboot the Faith and Sexuality Initiative and connect with a subset of BGLTQ students he thinks are often ignored. Though the original program primarily concerned Christianity, Scarborough wants to expand its reach to additional faith communities by working with different chaplains, including the new Muslim chaplaincy that University President Drew G. Faust announced in a letter at the end of January.
“In having emphasis on all aspects of intersectionality, religion and seeing how people’s other identities are intertwined with it is important,” Whittaker says.
Nico W. Tuccillo ’19 says he hopes that the Office of BGLTQ Student Life will partner more with student organizations. “I think… it would attract more people, and could be less intimidating for people because it’s not ‘come to this BGLTQ event’ it would be ‘come hang out with BGLTQ students while we do something together,’” he says. “I think if the Quoffice tried to connect more with those groups, it would encourage students to get to know it.”
Scarborough is excited to work with student groups on campus, regardless of whether they are explicitly focused on queer life. “That kind of creativity is exactly what I’m looking for, and that’s what I want my approach to the office to be,” he says. He recognizes that many BGLTQ students do not only express themselves through queer-oriented organizations, and that many also find meaningful experiences through the arts, athletics, or cultural and affinity groups.
“To assume that one set of programming or one set of ideologies represents that entire group is probably one of the biggest mistakes you can make as someone in a position to support students,” Scarborough says. “I don’t want us to miss supporting students because we have an expectation that BGLTQ students are a particular way.”
He also wants to connect with undergraduates who may not feel comfortable expressing their BGLTQ identity at all, saying that support is necessary for “all stages of outness and non-outness.” Scarborough acknowledges the inherent difficulty of connecting with students who may be closeted or intimidated by engaging with queer life at Harvard: “There are some students who will never want to come into the Office of BGLTQ Student Life,” he says. “[They] still need support.”
Scarborough and his team are planning programming tailored to those students. He speaks enthusiastically about “Coffee and Chat,” where anyone—BGLTQ or not, out or not—will be able to meet with one of the Office of BLGTQ Student Life student interns and and get involved in BGLTQ life in a casual setting. “We want to organize [opportunities for students] to explore without necessarily doing that in the presence of a lot of people,” he says.
Scarborough does not want students to have to face their problems alone. “Not being out can be very isolating,” he says.
UP NEXT
There seem to be obvious ties between Scarborough’s first college experience and his second. Closeted for his first three years at Harvard, he did not participate in the limited student-organized activities and social events available to him. From the sidelines, he watched as BGLTQ student life at Harvard went on without him.
Back at the College, Scarborough will construct programming designed to meet the needs of students facing many of the same problems that he did in college. When asked if his personal life inspires his work, he laughs. “Too much, maybe.”
But Scarborough sees his emotional investment as a plus. “I learned in Divinity School… that some work will put your soul on the line, in a good way,” he says. “There will be so much of you invested in the work that the work becomes you.”
There is something pleasantly cyclic about Scarborough’s journey. As an undergraduate, he wrestled with his identity. As a graduate student, he studied it. As an administrator, he will channel it to counsel and connect.
That said: By the time this story is published, Scarborough will have been the permanent Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life for all of three days.
During interviews, he spoke in suppositionals and hypotheticals, of aims, goals, and hopes. For now, he’s still a would-be changemaker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With President Donald Trump in the White House and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, undergraduates hoping to turn the political tide have flocked to introductory meetings of the Harvard College Democrats.
Last week, approximately 120 students interested in joining the Democrats—the largest liberal group on campus—attended the group’s introductory meeting, packing a room in Boylston Hall.
At the group’s second meeting on Tuesday, Democrats board members described the various committees new members could join and outlined the organization’s goals for the semester.
Sharon Yang ’18, president of Harvard Democrats, said Trump’s election in November is one likely reason for the surge in interest.
“Whether it’s pushing back against the Trump administration or continuing building on the progress that we’ve made for marginalized communities, I think there’s a strong sense of urgency that taking action now is incredibly important,” Yang said.
Also at Tuesday's meeting, members of the Democrats board detailed the group's decision to eliminate its "comp," a series of tasks and requirements that students previously had to complete to join the organization. Interested students no longer have to fulfill any requirements to join the Democrats.
“Calling it a comp is misleading, and it’s feeding into the culture of exclusivity at Harvard,” said Dominique J. Erney ’19, membership director of the Democrats. “We want you in this club if you want to be in this club.”
At Tuesday's meeting, several new members said they were motivated to join the Democrats to become more active participants in politics.
“I think it’s really important to be involved in politics, especially as a young person, because we really do have a say in what happens in our country,” Yilan Yang ’20 said. “I have a lot of issues I’m passionate about, and I think the Dems can make that happen.”
Other members said they were disheartened by the recent presidential election, and hoped to help elect more Democratic candidates in the next election.
“I hate Donald Trump, and I’m worried for the state of democracy in America,” Erica Newman-Corre ’19 said. “The Dems failed in November, and I think we need to do better.”.
Besides creating community within the organization, Yang said she also hopes to continue having an “open dialogue” with the Harvard Republican Club.
“Given the unique qualities of the Trump administration, I think there are actually a lot of things that the Harvard Democrats and the Harvard Republicans can agree on,” she said. “We’re always open to working with them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Journalists Judy Woodruff and the late Gwen L. Ifill will receive the Radcliffe Medal in May in recognition of their work on the PBS program “NewsHour.”
According to Lizabeth Cohen, dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the award annually honors “an individual who has had a transformative impact on society.” Cohen said that this was the first time that the Radcliffe Institute had awarded the medal to two individuals.
Michele L. Norris, a radio journalist and one of Ifill’s close friends, will receive the medal on Ifill’s behalf. A groundbreaking political reporter and newscaster, Ifill died Nov. 2016 at 61.
With this year's awards, Cohen said the Radcliffe Institute wanted to draw attention to the “importance more now than ever of integrity in journalism.”
“These are two journalists that we have major respect for and think have made major contributions,” she said.
Woodruff and Ifill will receive the award May 26 at the Institute’s annual Radcliffe Day celebration. “We’ve had a tradition of using the occasion to bring attention to the contributions of a woman and we build the day around the contributions of that person,” Cohen said.
On the morning of Radcliffe Day, journalists will participate in a panel called “(Un)Truths and Their Consequences,” moderated by Ann Marie Lipinski, the curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. The panelists will be government professor Danielle S. Allen; A’Lelia P. Bundles ’74, a former television producer and executive; E.J. Dionne ’73, a columnist for the Washington Post; and Peggy E. Noonan, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal.
During a luncheon after the ceremony, Woodruff will discuss her career in journalism with David Brooks, a columnist for the New York Times, and Walter Isaacson ’74, an author and president and CEO of the Aspen Institute.
Cohen said she wanted to invite speakers with different political views for the panel.
“We really think that the issue of integrity and truth in journalism is one that really transcends partisanship and we wanted to have people who were bringing different political perspectives and who shared concerns over the consequences of untruth,” she said.
Last year’s recipient of the Radcliffe Medal was Janet L. Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Previous honorees have included U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, University President Drew G. Faust, and former professional tennis player Billie Jean King.
Cohen said she hopes Radcliffe Day will not only honor the recipients of the medal but will also prompt attendees to think about integrity in journalism. “We started planning this before attacks on the media and fake news became hot topics,” Cohen said. “Our Radcliffe Day topic has only become more important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 9, 2017 at 12:38 p.m. 
In its first meeting of the semester Wednesday, the Committee on Undergraduate Education discussed two new Q Guide questions, a potential new schedule system based on 75 minute-long courses, and Harvard’s upcoming accreditation renewal process.
In an effort to gauge student textbook costs, the Q Guide—the College's course and instructor evaluation system—will contain two questions on the cost of course materials this spring, members of the committee said at the meeting. One question will ask students to specify how much money they spent on course textbooks, and another will ask for additional anecdotal information on the materials.
“The goal is to find out more about course costs,” said Elisabeth L. Laskin, assistant dean of Undergraduate Education, at the CUE meeting. “People talk about it a lot, but we don’t have any data to base it on. This is a way to start gathering this kind of data.”
The CUE also briefly discussed a potential new schedule to be introduced ahead of the opening of Harvard’s new SEAS complex in Allston, where roughly two-thirds of the SEAS faculty are slated to move in the fall of 2020.
To ensure students have sufficient time to travel between courses in Cambridge and Allston, the CUE discussed a new schedule with 75-minute course time slots, leaving 15 minutes for students to navigate to and from classes. Currently, undergraduate courses generally last either 53, 83, or 113 minutes, with seven minutes designated as an unofficial grace period between classes.
“Most of our schedule dates back to 1891 with a few minor changes in the 1910s,” Jay M. Harris, dean of undergraduate education, said. “Students are coming to class late all the time, through no fault of their own.”
Harris also said having classes be a standard length of 75 minutes will hopefully alleviate some scheduling problems that arise from some classes starting on the hour and others on the half hour.
The Faculty Council will vote on the decision to switch over to the new class schedule system in the coming months.
The CUE also discussed the Harvard's upcoming reaccreditation, a holistic review process conducted by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Harris said he hopes the reaccreditation will give Harvard the opportunity to reexamine many of its policies and procedures.
“We target educational effectiveness. We define that broadly. We really want to make sure we’re doing everything well and improve what we’re not doing well,” Harris said.
According to Noel Bisson, associate dean of undergraduate education, the CUE was founded in the 1960s to provide a forum for students and faculty members to discuss undergraduate education. Since then, members of the Undergraduate Council and a range of faculty members chosen from the Faculty Council have populated the committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy organization, held its first meeting of the semester Wednesday, setting goals for the year and discussing the history of the organization for students interested in joining.
Among this year’s priorities, the group is calling on the University to provide better accommodations for victims of sexual assault and  host regular training sessions for students. The group also hopes to continue to work with the Title IX Office to address sexual assault on campus after Mia Karvonides, Harvard’s former Title IX Officer, left the University in January.
“We’re gonna be pushing for a lot of demands that we’ve been quite vocal about in the past,” Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said.
In the five years the organization has been operating, members have taken a number of steps to criticize the University’s response to Title IX, including filing a Title IX complaint against the College and organizing students to advocate for survivors. Students from Our Harvard Can Do Better have also worked with members of the Title IX office to help craft informational materials about Harvard’s Title IX policies.
At Wednesday’s meeting, members of the organization discussed their past actions and offered new goals for the upcoming semester.
“The campus could be doing so much more,” Drisana M. Mosaphir ’17, a member of the group, said. “It’s really helpful to have an active student campaign working on this at all times.”
Kate Sim ’14  and Pearl Bhatnagar ’14 founded the group in 2012 in an attempt to change the conversation around sexual assault on campus and to hold Harvard administrators accountable for their role in supporting sexual assault victims, Jessica R. Fournier ’17 said.
One of the group’s main goals for the year is to improve “accommodations” for students who have been sexually assaulted. Fournier said accommodations include receiving extensions on assignments or rearranging housing assignments..
Goldberg said the group will be pushing Harvard to “systematically enforce the accommodations that survivors deserve and are entitled to under Title IX.”
Lack of knowledge about accommodations can be a big issue for students, Fournier said.
“This is a huge barrier and a huge problem,” she said.
The federal government launched an investigation into the College’s compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX in 2014. Last year, a recent graduate of the College sued Harvard in federal court, arguing that the University responded to her sexual assault complaint with “deliberate indifference.”
Both the federal investigation and the lawsuit are ongoing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds gathered in an Allston school gymnasium Tuesday to give input on the ongoing effort to renovate the Massachusetts Turnpike, a 138-mile toll road that runs through the Allston area.
At the meeting, members of the Allston Interchange Improvement Task Force briefed neighborhood residents on the most recent plans to straighten and rebuild the turnpike and offered attendees a chance to comment on the proposals.
In October 2013, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation unveiled plans to rebuild the Massachusetts Turnpike’s viaduct, an elevated highway built in 1960s. The structurally unsound viaduct then initiated broader conversations about transit improvement and community development.
Residents at the meeting called for “human-scale” streets as opposed to large highways with accident-prone intersections. They emphasized the need for safer streets for all users, including pedestrians and cyclists.
Allston resident Jessica Robertson said that the streets in MassDOT’s current plans “are too big and not what we want.” She suggested limiting larger streets to a maximum of four lanes and smaller ones to two or three lanes, with no median.
“Ultimately, we want traffic to fit the vision instead of the vision fitting to the traffic,” Robertson said.
During a presentation about north-south Allston travel, Emma Walters, executive director of Allston Village Main Streets, pointed to pictures of traffic jams on Harvard Avenue and Linden Street and said that for many, driving through the intersections presents a challenge.
In addition to residents, elected city and state officials and representatives from Harvard and Boston University were present at the meeting.
Kevin Casey, a Harvard spokesperson who attended the meeting, said MassDOT has made significant progress on the process by engaging with Allston residents.
“The [proposal] that was under consideration last night is one that is night and day from earlier iterations,” Casey said. “I think a lot of it had to do with the organized and thoughtful presentations that [community members] been consistently providing over the course of this entire process.”In order to straighten the Mass. Pike to free up land for development, MassDOT would have to cross Harvard-owned land in Allston. Harvard’s negotiations with MassDOT on the infrastructure project have resulted in a non-binding Letter of Intent in which Harvard outlines its key objectives.
These objectives, which largely align with those of Allston residents, include straightening the turnpike, building a multi-use bicycle and pedestrian path, and building West Station—a proposed commuter rail station to connect Allston with Boston proper and other western suburbs.
Many residents also voiced concerns about potential delays in construction of the station. Robert Sloane, a senior project manager at the nonprofit WalkBoston said he views West Station as “the centerpiece of this project,” but he thinks the MassDOT sees it as a project of “secondary importance.” Sloane said he would like to see a “rudimentary” West Station open for use while the turnpike is under construction.
However, Casey said, from an engineering perspective, “it could be easier and more certain in terms of the exact location if it were actually designed and constructed with in mind the development that would accompany it.”
“For Harvard, West Station does need to be part of the project, but there can continue to be a discussion on whether part of West Station is there day one or whether the entire station is constructed at a later time when development and demand creates the need,” he said.—Staff writer Lucy Wang can be reached at lucy.wang@thecrimson.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil M. Gorsuch seems like an unlikely friend for many at Harvard Law School.
But as a student at the Law School, Gorsuch, a federal appeals judge who’s awaiting his Senate confirmation, was friendly with students from across the political spectrum, and his Law School peers remember a conservative who avoided confrontation with the largely liberal student body.
Philip C. Berg, Gorsuch’s friend from Law School, said the two were in the Lincoln’s Inn Society, a social organization for Law School students, and wrote for the Journal of Law and Public Policy.
“Between the Journal and just the school work we had, that was quite a bit and he socialized a lot with the class,” Berg said. “He rarely missed those things. I think he saw the value in making friends there as well.”
Berg said Gorsuch was very sensitive to those around him, offering unwavering support when Berg came out as gay after law school.
“Neil was among those first ones that I told, and his reaction was instant and without skipping a beat and just gave me a sense of ever since then of absolute respect for the relationship,” Berg said. “[He] did not treat me any different than he did the moment before I said that or different from any of the other friends.”
Some of Gorsuch’s peers from his time at the Law School, though, question the extent of the public service work he did as a student. In his nomination speech, Trump referred to Gorsuch’s work in the Harvard Defenders Program and the Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Program, but some of Gorsuch’s peers have said that they don’t recall his involvement in the programs.
Elizabeth Buckley Lewis ’87, who was in Gorsuch’s Law School class and an active member of PLAP, said she did not recall knowing Gorsuch during her time at the Law School or seeing him involved with the project.
“He may well have been something, but had he been really actively involved I think I probably would have known him because I was very actively involved,” Lewis said.
Adam H. Charnes, another friend of Gorsuch’s from the Law School, said that even in the tense, divided environment of the early 1990s when they were students, Gorsuch was well-liked.
“There was a lot of agitation and a lot of protests and some pretty significant divisions between sort of the more left-wing students and the small cadre of more conservative students, but Neil got along with everybody,” Charnes said. “He was not a provocateur or a bomb-thrower as some on both sides were. He was a sort of a moderate in approach and had friends on both sides.”
As a judge, Gorsuch has similarly not explicitly shared controversial views. Law School professor Michael J. Klarman wrote in an email that Gorsuch’s views on a number of contentious legal topics remain unclear.
“We don't know, based on his judicial opinions, what are Gorsuch's views on lots of issues, but he has given speeches suggesting courts have played too large a role on issues such as abortion and gay marriage, and he has rendered decisions suggesting broad support for religious exemptions with regard to statutes that impose unwanted burdens on religious practices,” Klarman wrote.
Klarman wrote that while he would have preferred Merrick B. Garland ’74, former President Barack Obama’s nomination to the Supreme Court whose confirmation was blocked by Republican senators, he didn’t have any particular preference about who Trump nominated.
“I regard Justices as largely fungible votes. Any Trump appointee would vote the same way on abortion, affirmative action, gun control, etc., as any other,” Klarman wrote. “Some might be better lawyers and write better opinions, but it is canard, in my opinion, to believe there is such a thing as ‘good legal reasoning’ that operates independently of political commitments, at least with regard to [constitutional]  interpretation on the Supreme Court level.”
In a statement after Gorsuch's nomination, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow praised the Gorsuch's "devotion to public service" and "the rule of law."
"His work as a federal judge, scholar, teacher, and lawyer in both public and private practice, show commitment to rigorous thinking and fairness, and the nation is fortunate to have the benefit of his talents," Minow wrote.
Berg, who did not support Trump in the election, said he feels reassured by Gorsuch’s nomination.
“I do like the fact that he values the Constitution so highly and that makes me comfortable that he would, whoever is in the executive branch and whoever occupies the White House...be there making sure that those powers aren’t extended beyond what were intended,” Berg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After some Harvard Law School students requested more rigorous involvement in the search for the school’s next dean, University President Drew G. Faust has organized a series of panels to hear student perspectives on desirable characteristics of the next dean and the state of the school.
The search began last month after Law School Dean Martha L. Minow announced that she plans to step down at the conclusion of the academic year. A committee of faculty will advise Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 during the search. Faust also provided an open email account for students to give input on the search.
Three members of the faculty committee and about a dozen students attended the first panel, which was closed to the press, on Wednesday, according to Law School student attendee David D. Heckman. At the meeting, Heckman said students voiced opinions about what they would like to see in the new dean, discussed issues at the school they hope the next dean will address, and asked about the selection process itself.
“There was a pretty frank discussion,” Heckman said. “There was a little bit of ‘what does a dean do?’, and ‘how does that  influence the process?’, and then there was just a brief discussion of in terms of ‘what is the process and what is this committee designed to do?’”
Following the panel, the Law School Student Council unanimously passed a resolution requesting that candidates for the deanship complete a ten-point questionnaire prepared by the Council. The Council is sending the resolution to Faust and the advisory committee.
Heckman said he appreciates the administration’s effort to include student input in the search, but maintained that students should have have a more active role in selecting the dean.
“President Faust has her open email address but I think that the feature that you see in both of these are it’s just students talking at” administrators, Heckman said. “There’s a little less engagement and that’s not necessarily participation in the process.”
In an emailed  statement emailed, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson said  Harvard valued the input of Law School students during the search process.
A second panel will be held in Austin Hall on Feb. 14 at 12 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard spent over half a million dollars lobbying the federal government in 2016, a number that has held relatively steady for the past five years.
The University’s Federal Relations Office shelled out $550,000 last year—up $10,000 from 2015—lobbying Congress on legislation related to immigration, science research funding, Harvard’s tax-exempt status, and financial aid, according to public records filed with Congress.
The Federal Relations Office, located in Washington, D.C., works to lobby the federal government year-round. Harvard paid $120,000 to O’Neill, Athy & Casey, a boutique D.C. law firm specializing in lobbying Congress that Harvard has retained for years.
While the 2016 figures closely aligned with expenditures in previous years, University President Drew G. Faust said last semester she is “ramping up” advocacy efforts in 2017 under President Donald Trump. Most recently, Faust traveled to Washington in January to meet with several members of Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ’71.
Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communication, said spending typically increases during presidential transition years, but will likely increase more than usual under this administration.
“I suspect there would be a bit of added intense activity because of the nature of the transition,” Casey said. “In this instance, there seems to be even more need for engagement.”
In 2016, the University backed a variety of bills, including budget appropriations for research funding, the 21st Century Cures Act—which Congress passed in December to provide funds for biomedical research—and legislation related to university endowments and student aid regulations. Harvard also advocated around “Immigration reform issues, DREAM Act, H1B Visas and International Student Issues,” according to congressional lobbying disclosure reports.
Harvard spent more on lobbying than any other Ivy League school except the University of Pennsylvania, which spent $580,000. Yale spent $500,000, and Brown just $12,789. Dartmouth did not spend any money on lobbying in 2016.
Faust also works directly with lawmakers and advocates on behalf of University policy interests. Most recently, Faust signed a letter to President Donald Trump opposing his executive order, which bars immigrants from seven predominantly-Muslim countries and is currently facing scrutiny in federal court. Harvard jointly filed an amicus brief to a lawsuit against the order.
In a faculty meeting Tuesday, Faust reiterated three policy priorities for the University that she originally announced in December.
“I noted that there would be three areas of focus—continued advocacy for research support, making the case for the endowment and what it enables, [and] supporting the members of our community, especially those made vulnerable by new initiatives that have been appearing,” Faust said.
During his campaign, Trump pledged to get rid of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a program created by former President Barack Obama that provides legal protection to undocumented young people. Republican lawmakers have also questioned the tax-exempt status of large university endowments, and some professors fear that research funding, particularly for climate research, may be in jeopardy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down 4-3, playing side-by-side in tight matches, co-captain Bryan Koh and freshman Timmy Brownell held the weight of the previously undefeated Harvard men’s squash team’s hopes on their shoulders. But remaining undefeated was not to be.
With the first and second teams in the nation facing off against one another at the Murr Center on Wednesday, expectations of a hard-fought battle arose. The No. 1 Crimson (9-1, 5-0 Ivy League) and No. 2 Trinity (15-1, 6-0 NESCAC) delivered that much and more.
In a 5-4 thriller where momentum swung back and forth between the two squads until the night’s the final contest, the Bantams came out the victors, handing Harvard its first loss of the season.
“This was one of those losses where you can see the things you can learn from,” assistant coach Luke Hammond said. “Most of the matches that we lost, we were still fighting really hard. It’s the sort of thing where there’s disappointment in the result, but not in the effort, not even a little bit. We thought they held their heads overall and the adjustments that we need to make are relatively minor.”
Brownell’s bout against Trinity sophomore Michael Craig was a microcosm of the match as a whole. Leaving it all on the court, the rookie played with abandon, putting all of his effort in each and every point. Visibly exhausted by the fifth set, Brownell couldn’t eke out a victory, and his 11-7, 11-8, 4-11, 7-11, 9-11 result secured the Bantam’s match win.
“He ended up going down to the wire,” Hammond said. “Everyone was behind the glass and there was a lot of pressure there…. The other kid is a phenomenal player, has a lot of flare, plays with a lot of pace, and I think if Timmy is able to do just a few things differently he’ll be able to get ahead of him. ”
In the early goings, after the first wave of matches, it had seemed that the Crimson was on solid enough ground to secure the victory.
Sitting on a hard-fought 2-0 lead against Trinity junior James Evans with the squad looking to build on its 3-1 lead, senior Dylan Murray had a great chance to heavily swing the match in Harvard’s favor.
Instead, the contest slowly slipped away from the Crimson’s No. 8 player in a close defeat, 11-8, 11-8, 4-11, 3-11, 5-11. The fourth and fifth sets didn’t go without a fight, but a nagging leg injury seemingly took some of the spring out of Murray’s step as the match wore on.
The middle of the ladder is where Harvard played its best. All competing at completely different points in the match, the trio of Koh, freshman Sean Hughes, junior David Ryan, continued their winning ways.
At the fifth position, Ryan pushed the Bantam’s Tom De Mulder around the court throughout the match. Playing with much emotion and quickness, the Dublin, Ireland native fully controlled much of the gameplay.
In the end, Ryan put away De Mulder in emphatic fashion, faking a forehand and hitting a behind the back roller to seal the deal on match point.
While lacking the same dramatic flare, Hughes’ and co-captain Devin McLaughlin’s triumphs were just as important for the Crimson’s effort, as they helped the Crimson build its early lead in the contest.
Koh completed his victory when the day’s final result was no longer in question, but he nevertheless toiled through much of his bout needing to win to keep Harvard’s hopes alive. The Singapore native dropped the first set but rallied for three consecutive wins.
The top three positions on the ladder were not as fruitful for the Crimson, as tight losses became the norm for Harvard on the glass show court. Freshman Saadeldin Abouaish, junior Madhav Dhingra, and junior Bradley Smith all played individual games that required more than 11 points to win. But the group ultimately fell, 3-0, 3-0, and 3-1, respectively.
With the victory, Trinity regained the perch atop college squash that it has owned for much of the past two decades, at least for the moment. In a little less than two weeks when the Crimson hosts the CSA National Team Championships, Harvard hopes to change that narrative.
“We were in it right until the end,” Murray said. “I thought everyone fought really hard. There were a couple matches that could’ve gone either way and if it had gone our way we would’ve taken it. It’s definitely a bummer, but we can look forward to nationals and know we’re going to be right in it. It’s going to be a dog fight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 15, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote to Caroline Monrad that was actually from Kayley Leonard.
The squash courts usually have a reserved air, with cordial applause after fine rallies and shouts of encouragement given meaningfully. But with No. 3 Trinity visiting Cambridge, a large contingent of supporters came out in rowdy fashion to watch the annual marquee matchup.
The atmosphere was tense Wednesday afternoon at the Murr Center as No. 1 Harvard (9-0, 5-0 Ivy) took on the Bantams (13-2), its rival from Hartford, Conn.
In collegiate squash, the skill level of teams drops off appreciably after the top-ranked squads. The Crimson had not faced a comparable opponent since its Jan. 14 win against Penn. Trinity’s 5-4 defeat at the hands of the Quakers was, not coincidentally, its only loss of the season.
Coming off a weekend sweep against top-10 ranked Ivy League opponents Cornell and Columbia, the last two victims of the Crimson’s undefeated start, the Harvard women had momentum. Their winning streak continued on Wednesday, as the Crimson coasted to an 8-1 final decision over the Bantams.
The Crimson was the victim of a slow start, as Harvard dropped its first game in all three of the ongoing matches.
Especially frazzled was No. 3 sophomore Kayley Leonard, in the midst of a slow and deliberate technical face-off. Her opponent, freshman Vanessa Raj, converted drop shot after drop shot to counter Leonard’s equally methodical style.
Nerves were further frayed by a multitude of interference appeals going to the referee, and more often than not leading to let calls.
“So I lost the first game, and I was a little mentally out of it,” Leonard said. “But out of the first game I kind of refigured my strategy for the match. I’m not used to playing a squash player with a similar game as me, so we both had a very slow lob, drop kind of game.”
The second set was better for Leonard, who strung together point after winning point. The same happened for teammates No. 9 freshman Eleonore Evans and No. 6 senior Katherine Tutrone, who were playing adjacent to her.
The rust eventually wore off and the Crimson matched the intensity and technique of the upset-hungry Bantams. To adjust to a less aggressive opponent, Leonard played more straight balls and avoided taking rallies cross-court that made finesse shots easier to convert.
These sorts of adjustments catalyzed the first round of players to all sweep their next three games and put Harvard up the maximum after three matches, priming them to clinch the win.
The Crimson’s performance was almost predictable. It had a rough start because of recent lackluster competition. Because of mental toughness, it was able to bounce back.
“We’ve had a lot of mental training,” said No. 4 freshman Amelia Henley. “There’s been quite a lot of mentally visualizing and having really tough matches, so even though we may have won the last couple of matches the coaches have been really determined in trying to keep up focused and not get too complacent.”
Henley took that training to heart. She took her first two games, but trailing 3-7 in the third game, her momentum, and potentially her match, was slipping away. But then she started going back to her training.
“I think I just reset and focused on what my tactics were and just thought about getting one point at a time, forgetting what had just happened,” Henley said.
She managed to bring it to 9-9 and then score twice in a row to end the match in the minimum number of games.
This mental toughness was pervasive throughout the courts, and it guided Harvard to a healthy victory early in the match as it won the first five matchups. The only mishap came in the last game, as No. 7 junior Sue Ann Yong fell in five games after winning the first two.
She ended up on the other end of the battle, part physical part mental, against Trinity sophomore Jennifer Haley. Knowing that other teams possess the same killer instinct, optimizing their competitiveness will be key as the women go into the playoffs.
“So I think all of our players played really well,” sophomore Kayley Leonard said. “Even though the score was 8-1, I think it could have been a lot closer than it actually was…I think a lot of it came down to our fitness, as well. So we’re just channeling this win as we head into nationals in a few weeks.”
