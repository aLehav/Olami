Tucked between Eliot House and the University Lutheran Church, the modest two-story building on 21 South Street is an apt architectural metaphor for the organization it houses. The headquarters of the Harvard Advocate is more picturesque than pretentious, and save for a crest on the building’s facade, the quaint white siding and green window frames belie the literary clout that lies within.
Though the humble exterior may do well to conceal the presence of the country’s oldest continuously published college literary magazine, the interior tells a different story. The Advocate’s past literally envelops the space: the walls of the Sanctum are lined with rows of wooden plaques dating back to 1872. Names written in gold commemorate board members of each guard, the letters fading away with each older plate. To peruse these plaques along the perimeter of the room is to travel back in time through a chronicle of Harvard luminaries—L. Grossman, J. Atlas, T. S. Eliot, J. Ashbery, T. Roosevelt. 
History’s presence is ubiquitous in the Advocate, suspended over every aspect of the publication. Bookshelves sag with yellowing issues, and century-old, sepia-toned photographs of all-male editors hang above the fireplace, observing—from a bygone era—the activities of the publication today. This balance between revering history and promoting the avant-garde is what distinguishes the Advocate from other literary magazines and allows it to seek out the most innovative content.
A RICH HISTORY 

Founded in 1866 by Charles S. Gage and William G. Peckham, both class of 1867, the Advocate rose from the ashes of the Collegian, an earlier Harvard newspaper that had been shut down by university administrators following an attack on mandatory chapel attendance. 
Originally published in newspaper format, the Advocate was Harvard’s sole publication until The Crimson was founded in 1873. Three years later, some members of the Advocate left to form the Lampoon, and by the 1880s, the publication was exclusively devoted to essays, fiction, and poetry written and submitted by undergraduates.
Today, the Advocate, published quarterly, is composed of four content boards: poetry, fiction, features, and art. Their mission statement is simple—“The Harvard Advocate is concerned with supporting literature and the Arts on campus”—remaining largely unchanged for over a century. 

DULCE EST PERICULUM 

Despite constant reminders of the past, members say that the Advocate’s history neither defines nor restricts the organization.
Adopting the Collegian’s motto of “Dulce est Periculum” or “Danger is Sweet,” the publication has transgressed boundaries since its inception, for example, advocating coeducation at Harvard when the notion still remained radical. Members say that rather than obliging the magazine to conform to tradition, the Advocate’s history actually allows it to push forward and serves as a “springboard, not a shackle,” according to documents from the Advocate’s archives.
“There’s always been a tendency towards experimentation,” says Evan L. Hanlon ’08, a former Advocate art editor. “That willingness to push the envelope or touch the borders of what’s okay is still definitely alive.” 
Unquestionably, some of the Advocate’s most notable alumni have been the most iconoclastic. Hanlon cites past “Advokats” Norman K. Mailer ’43, Frank O’Hara ’50, and John L. Ashbery ’49 as writers who followed their own ideas about writing rather than obeying the status quo, a central tenet of the Advocate’s philosophy. 
MAKING HISTORY 
To this day, Advocate editors say they strive to feature content that they themselves admire, as opposed to simply chosing pieces that may be the most commercially successful or popular. The rich history of the Advocate, rather than engendering a conflict between the old and the new, actually contributes to its ability to find groundbreaking work.  
The Advocate attracts a large quantity of submissions for each issue, allowing editors to cull pieces of the highest quality. 
“We’re not running around desperate for content. We can be selective and get things that are really good and really new,” says design board member Joseph B. Morcos ’12, contrasting the Advocate with younger and less prominent publications on campus. “Our history actually contributes to the magazine’s ability to find ahead-of-the-curve things.” 
The history of the Advocate is also a source of certain privileges. For instance, the cover of the Fall 2008 Archives issue depicted collages by John Ashbery, a former Advocate editor. “No other magazine would be able to get the rights to those collages,” says Morcos. “But we can fall back on our history.” 
ON THE SAME PAGE
A shared pride in Advocate history binds former members to the organization, even decades after their involvement as undergraduates. Louis H. Begley ’54, the critically-acclaimed author, was a member of the fiction board while at Harvard and is currently the Chairman Emeritus of the Advocate’s Board of Trustees. In 2000, an annual prize was established in his honor for the best fiction piece published in the magazine.  
“The Advocate was very much at the center of my Harvard experience,” says Begley. “It was my home, if you like.” Begley describes long nights spent laying out the magazine by hand, cutting and pasting stories without the help of computers, and debating about literature. 
“Writing is a solitary business, but you have a desire for an audience,” Begley says, comparing the Advocate to a sanctuary for students who care about writing and the arts. “Creative writing classes fulfill that to a degree, but the Advocate gives budding writers a certain autonomy and companionship.” 
The support and fellowship that young writers and artists find at the Advocate is one that members say they most appreciate about their involvement—surpassing even the writing or artistic experiences they gained. 
Peter C. Nohrnberg ’93 and Stephen L. Burt ’93, current associate professors of English at Harvard, were both editors of the Advocate during undergraduate years, their present careers testifying to the role the magazine has played in nurturing and developing literary and artistic talent. 
“I remain grateful to the Advocate,” says Burt, “for providing me with a serious literary community where students could read the work of other students and discuss contemporary literature.” 
Douglas Mao ’87, currently an English professor at John Hopkins University, credits the Advocate for encouraging his then-nascent interest in literature. Though he concentrated in biology at Harvard, he realized during his junior year that his true calling was English, not medicine. After his work was accepted and published by the Advocate, Mao describes feeling encouraged. “The Advocate helped me feel where my heart was going,” he says.

THE ADVOCATE TODAY
Clad in a wrinkled button-down shirt and worn sweatshirt, Advocate President Sanders I. Bernstein ’10, a former Crimson Arts executive, looks the picture of a romanticized poet. With an unruly tangle of hair and dark circles under his eyes, he seems as if he hasn’t slept in three days, and rightly so: for the past week, Bernstein has basically lived at the Advocate in order to finalize the spring issue. 
“I have a pretty auxiliary position, really,” Bernstein says of his role as President. “I just make sure everything extraneous to the creation of magazine is dealt with.”  
He still recalls vividly the first time he ever stepped into the building as a terrified freshman for the introductory comp meeting. 
“There were clouds of smoke, glasses of red wine, people laughing at little jokes one of them would tell,” says Bernstein. “It was scary and just really bizarre, and I remember just sitting there on the floor, keeping my head down.” 
Despite an intimidating first impression, Bernstein is now undeniably at ease at the Advocate, which he describes as a home away from home. “It’s really come to feel like a community,” Bernstein says.  
Fittingly, “home” is a term often used by Advokats both past and present to describe the organization that  weaves tradition with innovation, and history with the present.

“Always write with a compass but not a map,” says Ceridwen Dovey ’03, quoting the contemporary Spanish author Javier Marias to describe the way she approaches writing. Dovey’s first novel, “Blood Kin,” follows the paths of three members of a presidential staff in a nameless country. “Blood Kin” was published in 2007, and since then, Dovey’s debut novel has accumulated a growing catalog of literary prizes and sparkling reviews. In many ways, the author’s own path has matched her approach to writing.Though published at first only in South Africa, the novel boasted a blurb by Nobel Prize winning South African novelist J. M. Coetzee, and quickly began receiving attention. Dovey, whose mother had written one of the first scholarly treatments of Coetzee’s work, called it a “miracle.” Since then, the book has been met with widespread acclaim, and has been published or is awaiting publication in 17 countries.Dovey’s literary success story is an unlikely one. She recalls feeling “sort of blown away” in her undergraduate years by the “Harvard idea of, ‘do what you love.’” At Harvard, she studied Anthropology and Visual and Environmental Studies, completing a documentary on South African wine farms for her thesis. “I wanted to make documentaries,” she said. “I didn’t take creative writing at all... I did take English 10a freshman year and that put me off English.” After working for the public television documentary program, “NOW with Bill Moyers,” Dovey moved back to South Africa. Dovey found that the resources in Cape Town, however, couldn’t stack up to Harvard’s well-stocked VES department. Out of what she calls “desperation” for creative outlet, Dovey enrolled in a Master of Fine Arts program at the University of Cape Town, where she wrote “Blood Kin” as her master’s thesis. The novel follows the barber, chef, and portraitist of a presidential household in an African country as they are taken hostage during a military coup.The novel strives to be emotional and intellectual, but the writer says “Blood Kin” intentionally strayed from the personal. “I wanted to avoid the trap of the debut novel, of narcissistically rewriting your own childhood,” Dovey says. “I didn’t want to be seen as ethnic literature or female literature.”And despite her success, Dovey hasn’t surrendered her other interests to the pen. She is currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program in Anthropology at New York University, where she is working on issues of climate change.But Dovey’s paths aren’t completely separate: she is working on another novel that is inspired by her work in anthropology. “It’s really only in the writing itself that ideas come,” Dovey says, giving words to a sentiment that feels as familiar and universal as Expos. “If I plan it out too much, then I don’t want to write.” For now, at least, Dovey is following her own compass.

The work of Arch C. Whitehead ’91 (better known as Colson Whitehead) has been invariably compared to Ralph Ellison’s masterpiece, “The Invisible Man.” He’s garnered plaudits of all kinds: a MacArthur Genius grant at age 32, Pulitzer finalist status for his novel “John Henry Days,” and a myriad of awards for young authors, including the Young Lions Fiction Award, the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, and a Whiting Writers Award. However, for all the attention paid to him within the world of letters, here at Harvard, he might as well be the man Ralph Ellison’s title refers to. As a Harvard undergraduate, Whitehead did not call attention to himself. As he admitted to the Crimson in 2003, he  “didn’t say anything.” Though he completed his coursework, he was not an exceptional student nor was he a central player in the publication scene on campus, eschewing the traditional incubatory institutions for a would-be-writer, opting not to take part in John H. Updike ’54’s Lampoon, David L. Halberstam ’55’s Crimson, or Norman K. Mailer ’43’s Advocate.  It was when he was eight years out, in 1999, after a stint as a critic at the Village Voice, that Whitehead began to make noise with the release of his first novel, “The Intuitionist,” which follows a black, female elevator inspector during a time of racial integration. Cameron Leader-Picone, a graduate student in the African-American Studies Department whose dissertation includes a chapter on Whitehead, says, “‘The Intuitionist’ was really big coming out of the gate. It became a major novel immediately. I had him assigned in two of my classes [as an undergraduate at Yale].” Whitehead has become a powerful voice in the literary world, participating in critical literary discourse, along with producing creative works. His novels “John Henry Days” (2001), a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and “Apex Hides the Hurt” (2006) have been highly lauded for Whitehead’s comedic command of language and his ability to create interesting conceits that explore race in a post-racial world. Leader-Picone says, “I think the African-American literary tradition is incredibly rich and I think that he moves it forward while also drawing deeply from it.” Recently, he even took shots at Professor of English James Wood, harnessing his comedic touch in a vicious parody of Wood’s “How Fiction Works.” The article, “Wow Fiction Works!,” which appeared in Harper’s Magazine in February, attacked the perceived snobbery of Wood’s approach to literature, the arrogance of  Wood’s crypto-normative approach. Whitehead assumed the voice of a pompous literary quack to make his point, “I have essayed to instruct your writers in how to write correctly. Now I will teach you to read correctly.” He himself has not been immune to criticism, however. His novels have been faulted for their refusal to directly confront issues of race head-on and the page-turning power of his plots have been called into question by more than one reviewer. Leader-Picone answers Whitehead’s detractors. “I think he is more focused on the politics of aesthetics. He is not political in the way African-American writers of the 1960’s were political,” Leader-Picone says. “And he is not unique in that.”And yet, despite Whitehead’s stature, in the last ten years he has come to speak at Harvard only once, as part of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute’s “Black Writers Reading” series in 2002. Though his work is taught on campus—Professor Henry Louis Gates’s English 276x, a graduate seminar on the African American Literary Tradition, features “The Intuitionist” on its syllabus—he is not present in any real way in the ethos of the school. Unlike past authors of some note, perhaps Mailer being the most Harvard-bound, his connection to the institution seems tenuous at best. In interviews, he rarely mentions his Harvard years.Later this month, Whitehead will embark on a tour to promote his new novel, “Sag Harbor,” an excerpt of which appeared in The New Yorker’s Winter Fiction Issue. Last time he was in town, in 2006, he drew a crowd of 75 people to the Brattle Theatre, according to Heather Gain of Harvard Book Store. This time when he is in Boston, he will read at Porter Square Books on May 7. When asked about the reading, Ellen Jarrett, who is in charge of organizing events for the bookstore, says, “I am very hopeful for a good event...His first book was very popular. And based upon the popularity of his piece in The New Yorker, it should be a good event.”

Paper is everywhere. Manila folders burst out of shelves in the publicity hallway, overflowing with press releases and reviews for past titles. Books fill the offices of the small three-story building. Clothbound volumes decades old press up against colorful editions published this year. Jacket covers hang on the walls in lieu of pictures.These people love books. Welcome to the Harvard University Press.
Founded in 1913, the Harvard University Press is one of the nation’s most renowned university presses. Its collection of scholarly books, as well as the Loeb Classical Library and I Tatti Renaissance Library, have earned the Press a coveted place among academic publishers. 
“Yesterday, we had a visit from people at the King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. They wanted to know our secret,” Editor-in-Chief Michael G. Fisher ’73 says. 
As the publishing industry struggles to adapt to changing readership, Press employees hope that the “secret” to their success—as they see it, conscientious editing—will sustain them in the future.
This editorial process has made the Press’s name. “[It] embodies one of the great editorial traditions of scholarly publishing in this country or anywhere else,” says Peter J. Dougherty, Director of the Princeton University Press.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS
The Press publishes about 200 manuscripts a year. Standards are high. Representatives of the press often scour academic conventions for the newest and freshest ideas. The nine acquisition editors follow scholars whose work might one day prove promising. Each is an expert in his or her field. 
“We’re lapsed academics,” says Elizabeth Knoll, an acquisition editor for Behavior Sciences, Education and Law. 
Just like getting into Harvard itself, getting one’s work into the Press is a struggle. “I had had a professional dream of publishing with them for years. I had to convince them that they should publish me,” Dr. Mark S. Micale says. Micale, a History professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, ultimately succeeded. The Press published his most recent book on medical history, “Hysterical Men,” last fall.
Obtaining the rights to publish a book is only the beginning of an extended process. Authors keep in constant contact with their editors, as they send in chapters and discuss ideas.
“They helped me present my material so that it would maximize its interest and reach beyond just other academic specialists,” Micale explains.
Manuscript editors then go through the draft to improve the quality of the prose. Before it can be printed, the manuscript must also be reviewed anonymously by two other experts in the field. Then the book, vetted and designed, can finally be sent out to the outside companies that compose and print the final product. Over the course of the process, Knoll says, “We shape, curate, and disseminate information.”
NEW FACE OF BOOKS
While this review process has made the Press’ name, staff members are always looking for new ways to make their books more relevant to the modern reader. For example, catchy design can make a scholarly work more accessible. Recently, the Press reissued the John Harvard Library, a series of American writings originally printed in the 1970s. Stormy blue-grey portraits of individual authors appear on the covers of each edition. The portraits, by contemporary artist Robert Carter, add energy to the old writings. 
“It gives a new feeling to these figures that people have just seen in dusty gilded frames and old galleries,” Carter says about his work. 
Fisher agrees. “Have you ever seen an issue of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ that looked so readable?” he asks.
And following trends that are emerging in the rest of the industry, the Press has moved to the Internet to encourage potential readers to return to books. The Press now has a blog and a Facebook.com page. Traffic is still minimal: the blog averages about 200 hits a day. Harvard University Press’ Twitter.com has over 1200 followers; Yale’s has over 1600. 
Blog posts and tweets announce information pertaining to everything from restaurant shout-outs to news stories—be they about publishing or another, totally unrelated subject. “It’s a good way to get the news out quickly and informally,” Senior Publicist Andrew Battle says. He’s wearing a green shirt stamped with the seal of the Loeb Classical Library, except that the seated Athena holds a beer. The back reads, “Homer, 82.” “It’s the shirt for  the Press softball team,” Battle explains. 
The Press is looking toward the future—they have to be. Sales are down across the publishing industry. “There was once the post-Gutenberg generation. Now we are dealing with the post-Google generation,” says Sharmilla Sen ’92, an acquisition editor for the Humanities. 
Still, the editors are confident that the services they provide to academia and readers at large will not become obsolete. “We perform a scholarly function—it’s eminently transportable to other media,” Knoll says. They hope that while information-gathering is changing, the book will remain relevant. 
“In 20 years, there’s still going to be paper in this office,” says Knoll.

With an MFA in creative writing from Columbia University under her belt and the release of her debut novel “Atlas of Unknowns” less than a week away, it seems ironic that at one point, Tania R. James ’03 dismissed writing as a viable career option. Even from a very early age, James was drawn to writing.“I guess I was always writing, you know, in the way little kids do, with complete freedom and deep seriousness,” said James.Although she continued writing in high school, James encountered opposition from her parents when she began to consider it as a career. Her mother dismissed writing as an “unstable profession.” “I kind of shared her belief that it didn’t seem possible,” said James. At Harvard, James concentrated in Visual and Environment Studies, specializing in filmmaking. She laughed when explaining her choice of concentration, given her mother’s concerns about a writing career. “I’m not sure why I chose filmmaking instead,” James said. “Maybe it was a small act of rebellion.”However, James continued to pursue writing throughout her time at Harvard, taking creative writing classes with visiting lecturers Patricia Powell and Brad Watson, as well as with Radcliffe Institute Fellow and novelist Gish Jen ’77.“She was funny and brilliant, kind of like her work,” James said of Jen. “She made me consider the contemporary world—why we write, why we make art.”  In her senior year at Harvard, James was faced with a difficult career choice She decided to pursue an MFA in creative writing from Columbia. “When deciding between film and writing, I guess I felt writing was the place where I felt the most free to experiment and take risks,” she said. James didn’t leave film completely upon entering Columbia. In her first year out of graduate school, she worked as an assistant editor and producer for Operation Iraqi Filmmaker. She admits that she hasn’t been able to let go of her attraction to the art. “I still get jealous of people all over New York walking around with cameras and equipment,” she said. But James’s nostalgia for her filmmaking days are overshadowed by her enthusiasm for her new book.  “Atlas of Unknowns”, which will be released by Alfred A. Knopf on April 21, tells the story of two sisters in Kerala, India. In the novel, the younger sister makes her way to America as a student while the older is left behind. Inspired by a trip to her father’s village, Kumarakom, in 2006, “Atlas of Unknowns” is James’s first novel. Karen Russell, who attended Columbia’s MFA program with James and had several workshops with her, praised her former classmate’s work.“Her sense of humor has an incredible inventiveness, but there is also a lot of heart to it,” said Russell, also a published author. “And there is sort of a kinetic energy to her writing—every sentence is humming with life.”Jordan Pavlin, a senior editor at Knopf for both James and Russell, expressed optimism not only about “Atlas of Unknowns”, but also about James’s future.“I think she’s a born novelist,” wrote Pavlin in an email to The Crimson. “This is the first of many captivating stories Tania will tell.”Pavlin is not the only one convinced that James made the right career choices after all. Despite her previous doubts about a career as a writer, James herself seems content with her decision.“Right now, I can’t imagine doing anything other than what I’m doing: writing,” she said.

Sitting in Crema Cafe, non-fat latte in one hand and BlackBerry in the other, freshman novelist Isabel E. Kaplan ’12 parries her timid demeanor with confident eloquence. She has the air of total normalcy that most Harvard students manifest, but in both pedigree and talent, Kaplan is a far cry from normal. Her book pitch in seventh grade garnished a mention in Page Six of The New York Post, but Kaplan had to wait till the ripe age of 16 to finally sign her first book deal. However, patience paid off; Kaplan’s debut novel, a project more than two years in the making, is set to hit bookstore shelves on June 30. “Hancock Park” chronicles the coming-of-age story of Becky Miller, who attends the posh Whitbread School for Girls in L.A. The publisher’s blurb on the Tower Books Web site is dramatic. “Surrounded by the children of high-profile celebrities... Becky Miller faces even more challenges in the form of self-absorbed parents, her weight, and her painfully high intelligence, which culminate in a nearly brutal day-to-day existence.”The plot draws noteworthy parallels to Kaplan’s own background. Kaplan has been a resident of L.A. all her life and graduated from the elite, all-girls Marlborough School, located in Hancock Park. “Certainly the experiences and situations and the settings and the places involved are things I have to understand, to know about, otherwise I wouldn’t feel comfortable writing about it authentically,” Kaplan says. However, the young author denies that her novel falls into the roman à clef genre.“This isn’t meant to be my, and certainly isn’t, my exposé,” Kaplan says. “The characters are not Marlborough girls. I am not Becky Miller.” In fact, Kaplan had to disappoint people who were hoping to appear in her book, stressing that she was writing a novel. Kaplan is also reluctant to draw connections between “Hancock Park” and the popular “Gossip Girl” series or The A-List series, which all share similar settings. “I think ‘Hancock Park’ is a study of Los Angeles insider life from someone who feels she is at the edge of the inside, and doesn’t feel completely at home.” Kaplan said “There are lots of other books out there, like ‘The A-List,’ that are from the point of view of girls who feel really at home there... Becky Miller is certainly within that world, but she feels a little out of place. “Kaplan said she signed her book deal with HarperCollins in the summer after her sophomore year, following a book party, where her mother introduced her to an editor.Her mother, Susan Estrich, was the first female president of the Harvard Law Review, and is now a political commentator for Fox News. Her father, Martin H. Kaplan ’71, is associate dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and a former White House speech writer.“I’m not riding on my parents, though,” Kaplan says, “I’m trying very hard to do this on my own accord and out of my own merit.” Kaplan said she mentioned her idea for a book on L.A. insider life to the HarperCollins editor at that party. According to Kaplan, the editor was encouraging and she secured a meeting to pitch her book in the form of a 20-page preview. The day after her meeting, she said, she got a call: HarperCollins wanted her book. Contract secured, Kaplan spent the next two years working on her novel, working closely with her editor throughout the process to develop the book. At the same time, though, Kaplan was also juggling the hectic high school career of the usual Harvard student on top of writing.“I do remember sleeping in high school,” Kaplan says, “Perhaps not as much as I would like.” Kaplan spent all of junior year and the beginning of senior year developing a “rough draft” of the novel, and the majority of her senior year was spent editing. She submitted her final edits the day after her high school graduation. Kaplan kept the book under wraps during development, even from her parents, considering writing to be a private process. However, several of Kaplan’s freshman friends at Harvard have been allowed to read galleys of her novel. Her friend Jana O.M. Christian ’12 said that Becky Miller was definitely not Kaplan’s doppelgänger. However, she said, “there are many one-liners of commentary that really gave me an insight on part of her life.” Though Kaplan was reluctant to commit herself to discussing upcoming projects, she does seem optimistic that whatever the future holds, it will involve writing. “I have no idea what’s coming next,” Kaplan says. “The novel I write next… we’ll have to wait and see.”

As Tanya V. Bezreh ’95 walked through Harvard Yard last Saturday, a friend asked what it was like to be a Harvard graduate. “Doors really swung open for me,” Bezreh joked. “I had to make a lot of porn to get those doors to stop swinging open.” An alum who has made her name creating and starring in short erotic films, Bezreh is one of several Harvard students, past and present, who have embraced an industry not usually associated with the Harvard brand name.“There’s a persistent stereotype that Harvard isn’t about pleasure. It’s about brains,” said Michele S. Jaffe ’91. Now an author of young adult novels, Jaffe entered the world of fiction through her romance novels, which Amazon.com called “steamy… Do not lend this to your mother.”“The sex scenes are designed to turn you on,” she said. For Jaffe, the fact that she was a Harvard graduate served to help market her books because of the perceived incongruity between sex and intellect.Camilla A. Hrdy ’04, co-founder of the undergraduate sex magazine H Bomb, encountered a similar stereotype when launching her publication. Much of the publicity around H Bomb, she said, came from “the cool dichotomy about Harvard being about being smart and not thinking about sex.” But, continued Hrdy, that perceived dichotomy is not reflective of reality. “At least not for my friends,” she laughed.Bezreh said that, like Hrdy, she contemplated producing an erotic magazine during her years at Harvard. But in Bezreh’s case, the stereotype held her back.“It just didn’t seem appropriate,” she said. “Harvard is like, the most privileged thing that can happen. And making porn or making erotic stuff can be very stigmatizing... I was scared that it would mess up my career.”Bezreh later confronted her fear by creating the short film “Naughty Garden” and starring in the HBO special “Real Sex: Porn 101: XXXtra Credit,” a documentary about her making the film. “For me,” she said. “I had to go overboard.”“Naughty Garden,” which cast several MIT and Harvard students, is “very spanking-oriented,” she said.Bezreh has followed up “Naughty Garden” with “Coming Out Spanko,” which portrays Bezreh’s process of confronting her fear and coming to terms with her sexual fantasies. It won Best Documentary Short in the 2008 CineKink Film Festival.For Bezreh, creating these films is part of a personal mission to come to terms with the shame she has felt about her fascination with sadomasochism and her greater mission to dispel the stigma associated with kink. Bezreh works as a life coach for people dealing with similar issues. She is also working toward a Master Degree in health communications through a joint program with Emerson and Tufts. Although Bezreh is not alone in experimenting in erotica, other Harvard students and alumni have had different motivations for their participation in the industry.Matthew di Pasquale ’09 made waves last September by publishing Diamond Magazine which featured him posing nude. When asked why he founded the magazine, Pasquale said, “for attention, I guess.” “I wanted to make a statement,” he said. “Sex isn’t a bad thing. Sex can be fun.”Pasquale originally envisioned his magazine as “a Playboy for Harvard”. He said he chose not to join the existing campus magazine on sexuality, H-Bomb, because he wanted to make a magazine that was less artistic. H Bomb, on the other hand, has another purpose. “It was intended for the enjoyment of undergraduates,” Hrdy said. “I think we had a purpose to push social boundaries to some extent.”Co-founder Katharina P. Cieplak-von Baldegg ’06 said the creation of the magazine was driven by the importance of having a conversation about sex and sexuality on campus. “We wanted to cover every kind of context,” she said, “Whether it was social or artistic or biological.”Harvard students and alumni have confronted different responses to the work they have done in erotica.“It was interesting to see how it didn’t really matter to a lot of people,” Di Pasquale remarked. “A lot of people didn’t care.”As for H Bomb, “I think some of the boys were upset that it wasn’t more erotic,” said Hrdy of its first publication. “I heard some say that there weren’t enough raunchy photos… But you know, our mothers really liked it.”Bezreh said that the reactions to her first film were, in general, not what she was looking for. “I had a lot of really high concept, theoretical ideas about what I wanted to say and what I wanted that gesture to mean,” Bezreh said. “I got a lot of fan mail, ‘Oh your movie was really fun and hot.’… I wasn’t very interested in that.”Her second film elicited reactions that were more in tune with Bezreh’s intentions. Speaking of her fans, she said, “They responded from a vulnerable place instead of from a sexual place.” Bezreh said that she intends to continue making art in the erotic arena. Hrdy and Cieplak-von Baldegg have, since H Bomb, left erotica behind them.Cieplak-von Baldegg, who went to work for Current TV after Harvard, said that her work there continued addressing relationships and sex. She credits her involvement with H Bomb in helping to secure her job with Current, where she has worked with other Harvard alumni, including Kyle A. Gilman ’02, creator of the 2008 documentary “Awkward Webcam Sex”. The film chronicles the webcam interactions of his fictional long-distance relationship, and the reactions of people when he posted the clips. Hrdy is now in law school, and said that she doubts she will have enough time to ever get involved in something like H Bomb again. Yet she did not dismiss the possibility. “If the law market goes down,” she said laughing. “I’m going back into the erotic industry.”As for Harvard students who contemplate deviating from the expected “Harvard path,” Cieplak-von Baldegg encourages them to pursue their original ideas. “It’s what [you’ve] worked on and… produced that people are going to be interested in,” she said.Bezreh’s advice was more cautious. “I think that pornography/erotica is the medium, and it really depends on what you’re saying,” she said. “You could have the most misguided reasons for being involved with it or you could have almost the most beautiful reasons for being a part of it.”“I don’t mean to be the voice of caution,” said Bezreh. “But I think the stigma is real.”

Seven years ago, Paul Harding was just starting out as an Expos preceptor. At nights he would teach fiction writing at the Harvard Extension School, then go home and help take care of his newborn son. “Once I had kids, I realized how much free time I used to have,” Harding says. “It was a kick in the ass; I couldn’t be precious about writing.” Over the next three years he would juggle his careers as educator and father, while completing his first major published work.
Harding’s debut novel, “Tinkers,” published this past January, was the product of various scraps of writing—from a 4x6 notebook to Post-It notes and scratch paper. Harding refers to this haphazard production strategy as “guerrilla writing.”
“I learned to drop right into the mental space,” he says. “When I had two free minutes, I would write. When I’m doing dishes, I would think about what to write.”
Time pressures exist for every creative writer at Harvard, from the professional to the ambitious student, and those writers have learned to cope in different ways.
“Writing takes a lot of mental energy,” says Shoshanna L. Fine ’10, one of few students accepted to write a creative thesis. “I’m fortunate that there is a creative track in the English department that allows me to prioritize writing.”
Fine, now in her third fiction workshop with Senior Lecturer Bret A. Johnston, acknowledges that the formal deadlines of a workshop are helpful in sustaining her writing. “There is so much going on that I can’t find time to do things if there isn’t a school pressure,” she says. “I would probably not be a writer if I were not writing a thesis and taking these courses.”
Others see creative writing as a complementary endeavor to their academic studies. Angelo S. Mao ’10 is an Engineering concentrator who plans to pursue a career in that field. On the side, however, Mao has written around 20 short stories, a novel, and 50 poems, and he has taken three creative writing workshops.
“I like to think that it didn’t hurt my grades, because it fulfilled some spiritual or psychological need that helped me do better in classes,” says Mao, smiling. “At least that’s what I tell myself.”
Fiction writers are especially affected by the pressure on Harvard students to use their degrees for a high-powered career. The publishing industry is infamously difficult to break into, and success is far from guaranteed. “A writer is a hard thing to become,” Fine says. “I’m not sure—maybe [I’ll write] at some point, but not immediately after college. Maybe.”
Mao also feels an obligation to stay in the sciences—a pressure he partly attributes to his upbringing. “I see a career in engineering as more productive,” he says. He expresses discomfort at having to compromise his writing to satisfy the industry. “Writing professionally means you have to deal with being a popular writer. I hold myself to a higher standard.” At the same time, Mao wouldn’t be happy being “just a scientist,” saying that he will continue to write on the side.
And in addition to balancing other interests and personal integrity, there is also the issue of paying the bills. Harding, who now teaches only at the Extension School, puts the financial matter bluntly. “If you’re going to be a fiction writer you have to understand that you’re not going to make any money out of it,” he says. “You need to assume a profession to get the paycheck.”
DON’T ASK, DON’T TELL
Eric D. Bennett ’97 has a scholarly air about him. He speaks slowly and chooses his words carefully, as a fiction writer might.
“It takes audacity to declare yourself as a fiction writer, especially with no prior publication,” the Pforhzheimer House tutor says. 
As an undergraduate, Bennett attended Deep Springs College and finished his B.A. in English at Harvard University. He received his Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) from the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop and is earning his Ph.D. in English at Harvard this year. His dissertation is on the rise of creative writing programs after World War II. He is currently working on his second novel.
“Writing fiction while doing a graduate degree in English is probably something like being gay in the Army,” Bennett says. “Half your colleagues are titillated by the same thing as you. But it doesn’t mean they want you to talk about it.” 
That might explain the fact that while there are many writers among Cambridge’s literati, Bennett feels the writing scene can be surprisingly hush-hush.
According to Bennett, the relative silence of the writing community stems from a combination of individual pride and the English Department’s notoriously critical approach. Bennett perceives this as having an indirectly positive effect. 
“The English Department discourages writing on the side, but not explicitly,” Bennett says. “Those who take writing seriously learn it’s best to do it on one’s own.”
Despite holding an MFA, Bennett is lukewarm about creative writing programs. “MFA programs seem unrelated to excellent writing...Writing programs are gratifying, but there should be no inflated expectations about how one will advance a career,” he says. “Workshops should probably be regarded as personal, not professional opportunities.” 
Still, Harvard offers a wide array of avenues for a writer. “Harvard is full of great ideas and people,” Bennett says. For aspiring writers, he recommends concentrating in “something other than creative writing to gain an idea of another field, which would improve you as a writer.” 
Bennett also argues against the idea of establishing an MFA program at Harvard, pointing out that Harvard’s undergraduate program produces enough great writers on its own. “If you look at a list of Advocate alums, it compares remarkably well to graduate programs in writing like the one at Iowa,” Bennett says, referring to the Harvard literary publication of which he was also a member. “Harvard recognizes this, and they know a Bachelor’s is enough.” 
Much of creative writing’s inconspicuousness has to do with its being a solitary pursuit, which is often integral to its appeal. But for those who seek it, a fiction community exists both within Harvard and the Cambridge area.
Apart from undergraduate publications like the Harvard Advocate and Tuesday Magazine, the Dudley House Review provides a more graduate student-friendly space for writers to come together in workshops and in print.
Rita Banerjee, a graduate student in Comparative Literature, has lived in New Jersey and Washington and calls the Cambridge creative community particularly strong.
“Graduate students and undergraduates are very dedicated to the craft, which is often of a MFA quality or better, and students respect their peers,” she says. “It’s really nice to have a sense of community—it gives you a sense of the aesthetics you believe in.”
When she is not working on her newest manuscript of poems, Banerjee is an editor at the Dudley Review and also participates in the Cambridge Writers’ workshop. Unlike Bennett, she advocates expanding the fiction community on campus.
“Harvard would do well to get more outlets for its writers, [more places] for students to showcase their works.”

Studying fiction at Harvard has several prerequisites: a love of reading; a love of writing; a love of deep, introspective conversations about context and syntax over a steaming latte; and, of course, a love of frenzied highlighting of key passages in the wee hours of the night. Here’s a rundown of the fiction concentrations—see how well you match up.
ENGLISHTrust the popular consensus? With over 250 concentrators in 2007, the English department is proven to be one of the most popular places to study fiction—and with good reason. Students have considerable flexibility in carving out their focus, with the ability to take a class on virtually any time period and focus on a myriad of authors. If you’re interested in stretching your creative legs, test your skills in anything from playwriting to poetry to science fiction. 
If you enjoy interacting with well-known authors and opportunities to schmooze with faculty members, then the “Writers in the Parlor” series and “Tea Stop” gatherings are just what you’ve been looking for. A recent curricular change replaced old requirements with four common ground requirements in the area of Arrivals, Diffusions, Poets, and Shakespeares. But don’t fret: you can still take the new iterations of Major British Writers I and II if you want to. Apart from academic demand, the department’s rich offerings do come with an added pressure: you have to look good while doing it. English concentrators usually dress the part—look no further than the plethora of glittery scarves that adorn the inhabitants of the Barker Center Café—and exude a certain je ne sais quoi that suggests that they just might be better read than you are. Judging by the concentration requirements, they probably are.
HISTORY AND LITERATUREContext. Context. Context. But most importantly: context. As a Hist & Lit concentrator you’d better have a deep appreciation for the who, what, when, where, and why of what you’re reading. One of the great things about the concentration is that it allows you to sample many extra-departmental courses and count them for concentration credit. As the oldest Harvard concentration, Hist & Lit tends to kick it old school, with a heavy emphasis on tutorials, small classes, and personal attention for concentrators. A less fortunate aspect of the old school method: lots of hard work. An application is required to enter the concentration; other requisites include an oral exam at the end of sophomore and senior year, a junior research essay, and a student bibliography of studied texts to be prepared at the end of sophomore, junior, and senior year.
If you enjoy some adventure in your life, you’ll like the fact that Hist & Lit has a large degree of flexibility in designing an individual plan of study. The concentration requires you to select a special field within the concentration with a focus on America, Latin America, Modern Europe, Postcolonial Studies, Early Modern Europe, Medieval Europe, or a field of your choice—pending tutor approval. In short, a Hist & Lit concentrator has to endure a fair amount of paperwork, but for someone interested in planning out a specialized field of study, the extra work is well worth it. 
LITERATUREAre you trilingual? Do you harbor a special love for all incarnations of the story of 1001 Nights? Do you consider the writings of Copernicus, the poetry of Apollinaire, the philosophical musings of Aristotle, and the narratives of Tolstoy to have equally great literary value? If so, you’ll feel right at home in the Lit concentration. It may be a smaller concentration than its peers, with about 50 concentrators in 2007, but like the other fiction concentrations it allows students to construct their own specialized field of inquiry. The emphasis in the Lit department is on cross-cultural comparisons, so either come in with some foreign language skills or be prepared to learn some. Along with its Hist & Lit, its cousin concentration, Lit has a foreign literature requirement and encourages concentrators to study abroad for a semester—so you’ll probably leave Harvard worldlier than you came. 
Lit concentrators work throughout their college careers to answer the question, “What is literature?” Lit’s flexibility allows concentrators to explore the fields of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Visual and Environmental Studies in pursuit of an answer. If you enjoy debating the merits of spoken versus written word, or if you’ve got that well-traveled, inquisitive, and black-turtleneck-with-black-jeans-with-black-shoes-with-dark-rimmed-glasses look about you, Lit is where you belong.

While undergraduates at the College and students at the Extension School don’t tend to mingle much, just take a look at both course catalogues, and you’ll find some striking parallels. 
With 13 creative writing course listings at the Extension School, the opportunity for student diversity is great. But as for the courses themselves, at least on paper, they look a whole lot like what undergraduates are used to at the College. 
The creative writing offerings provided by both institutions are nearly identical, and many members of the creative writing faculty at the Extension School are in fact part of the College’s Expository Writing program.
REQUIRED WRITING
Just as all undergraduates at the College must take Expository Writing, Expos is also a requirement for the Extension School degree program. 
“The fiction and expository writing classes are great complements,” said Dr. William Weitzel, an Expository Writing preceptor at the College and the instructor for the Extension School’s Intermediate Fiction Writing course. 
Indeed, many of his creative writing colleagues at the Extension School share a similar pedigree—splitting their time between their responsibilities at the Extension School and Expository Writing program at the College. 
Like Weitzel, Dr. Ken Urban, a professional playwright and director, is an instructor of playwriting at the Extension School who also teaches Expository Writing to undergraduates.
Before enrolling in Urban’s playwriting class, Chris Hayes, a student at the Extension School, was required to take Expository Writing to fulfill his degree requirements. He explains that although he was one of the few students that enjoyed his Expository Writing class, the course was among his most positive academic experiences thus far. 
“Any time you learn a new style of writing, you are exercising your writing muscle, “ Hayes said. “Professor Morrison, my expository writing professor, was fantastic, and although the course itself was stressful, I was able to add to my toolbox and think critically and analytically.”
CREATIVELY WORKING

Like the College’s English Department, the Extension School’s creative writing program covers a wide range of genres—from playwriting and memoir to novels. 
For students like Hayes who are seeking to develop their writing, the range of courses provides ample space for exploration. 
Hayes, who is specially interested in screenwriting, is currently enrolled in Urban’s playwriting class. After taking a screenwriting class last year, he decided that this would help enhance his writing. 
The course is designed for students with little or no experience in writing plays. Assignments consist of drafting small dialogues or monologues, while the class culminates in students writing ten-minute long scripts. 
“What’s neat about [this course] is that after we do our assignments, they all get read in class, and then everyone makes comments in a very structured way,” Hayes said. “You really feel the pressure of a real playwright, because if your work stinks it could be really embarrassing. It forces you to think of it in a realistic environment.”
Like Urban, other faculty members at the Extension School bring their own professional, real-life experience to the classroom. Christopher S. Mooney, who teaches a course on suspense fiction, is a published author of suspense novels. Robin Lippincott, who leads a section of Intermediate Fiction Writing, has written three novels and a collection of short stories. 
Lippincott believes that to become a good fiction writer, one must think like one. It is this mentality that informs his teaching. 
“For the first few weeks of the class, I bring in published stories for the students to read and study,” said Lippincott. “This teaches them to read like a writer and thus helps them to learn elements of fictional technique.”
The Extension School also features a course titled “Writing the Novel,” which is taught by William J. Holinger, a former Expository Writing preceptor and current director of the Harvard Summer School Secondary School Program. Holinger has been teaching this course for over a decade, although this year he revamped it to present the material in a different way—emphasizing point of view, voice, and narration, as well as narrative structure and plot. 
Holinger says that he devotes a lot of time in this course to focusing on the students’ own work and discussing the process behind writing a novel. 
According to Holinger, “Writing a novel is a huge enterprise. Everyone does it differently, and so we discuss process in just about every class.”
In addition, Holinger also invites a novelist to speak to his students every semester. For the past several years, this visitor has been a former student of the class.
THE STORIES BEHIND THE STUDENTS
One of the defining characteristics of the Extension School courses is the great diversity of the students who take them. Although most of the creative writing courses are capped at fifteen students, participants hail from unique backgrounds, and represent a wide range of ages. One student in Holinger’s class actually flies in every week from Georgia to take his course at the Extension School. 
Holinger adds that while the Extension School officially caps its creative writing courses at 15 students, he tends to admit more than that “because life intervenes, and students’ lives change: they move away unexpectedly, they change jobs, they have a baby—whatever.” 
When he’s selecting students for his classes, Hollinger explains that he tries to ignore their ages and focus on their novels. This term, his class consists of 17 students—most of whom are in their 20’s and 30’s, although some are in their 50’s and older. 
According to Lippincott, the students in his course are equally varied. Represented in his Intermediate Fiction Writing course are Harvard undergraduates, recent college graduates, as well as professionals—including lawyers and journalists. 
Weitzel believes that this diversity is what makes his class enjoyable for his students as well as for him. 
“I really enjoy teaching fiction in the Extension School,” he said. “A wide range of students enroll who bring with them a great deal of enthusiasm and determination. Their excitement is infectious.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Approximately 30 students attended a panel discussion on the current drinking age policy and its effectiveness on college campuses in Harvard Hall yesterday evening.“We were going for a more nuanced discussion than just ‘the [current] drinking age sucks’,” said Anita J. Joseph ’12, the chair of the National Campaign Committee, the group within the Institute of Politics that sponsored the discussion.Joseph is also a Crimson editorial board editor.The discussion featured guest panelists from several walks of University life, including Ryan Travia, director of Alcohol & Other Drug Services at UHS, and Economics Department Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron. Stefan K. Muller ’12, the president of the National Youth Rights Association, a group that advocates lifting legal restrictions that are imposed on minors, was also a panelist. IOP Fellow and political consultant Teresa M. Vilmain moderated the discussion.	The panelists specifically focused on the need for more youth education about alcohol abuse as well as developing potential policies that could help prevent further underage drinking. “We need to do more than just change the law. We really need to change how people are educated about alcohol,” said Muller, who identified himself as an advocate of lowering the drinking age. “Alcohol itself is neutral. The abuse of alcohol is what needs to be taken care of,” he added.Alcohol policy at the College made headlines last year when the Undergraduate Council party grant system came under fire from the administration led by David R. Pilbeam, then serving as interim dean of the College. Pilbeam also instituted a ban on hard liquor at House events, and new guidelines regulating the funding and alcohol consumption at student group parties, which led some students to express discontent about the College’s stance on underage drinking, Though the panel engaged in an hour-long dialogue regarding current problems and possible solutions, some spectators noted that the overall tone seemed to favor one side of the debate. “I thought  it was a little bit more represented by the side that endorses lowering the drinking age,” said audience member Nicholas E. Souder ’09. “But I thought that their answers were also thorough and convincing.”

Robert W. Jensen, a professor of journalism at the University of Texas, told a small audience yesterday that Americans will continue to encounter difficulties in dismantling white privilege because many in the white community are afraid to discuss racial issues.The noontime discussion, which took place in the Phillips Brooks House Asssociation Parlor Room, attracted about 14 people to hear Jensen speak.“We’re used to thinking about the fears of people in subordinated communities, but there’s also fears that come from being white,” Jensen said.He added that sources of these fears include the difficulty of trying to occupy the middle ground between letting offensive racial comments slide and drawing ire from colleagues as a result of being overly sensitive to them—a balancing act that he sometimes finds difficult.“I don’t get invited to parties much nowadays,” he joked.Jensen, who is the author of The Heart of Whiteness: Confronting Race, Racism and White Privilege, began the discussion by quoting a passage from the W.E.B. Du Bois book, The Souls of Black Folk.In this excerpt, Du Bois commented on a question that he felt Caucasians often implicitly asked of him, “How does it feel to be a problem [as an African American]?”“Maybe we should reverse the direction of the question,” Jensen said. “Maybe we should redirect it towards ourselves.”Despite the small attendance, those who did participate said that they found it enlightening and enjoyable.Susan B. Marine, director of the Harvard College Women’s Center, said that she especially appreciated the contributions of the audience members.“I was really impressed with the level of honesty, and that people were willing to share,” said Marine. “This is a complex subject, and it’s difficult to talk about sometimes. [It’s] fraught with a lot of silence, hesitation, and ambivalence, especially by white people.”Loc Truong, assistant director of the Harvard Foundation, said that he felt that a major take-home point from yesterday’s discussion was that people should be more forthright in discussing white privilege and racism, especially on campus.“My advice to students is to really be open to attending these kinds of events, and to talk to their blockmates and classmates about these issues,” he said.

The use of credit cards among college students has risen to an all-time high, according to a report released Monday by student loan company Sallie Mae. According to the report, college students own an average of 4.6 credit cards, and the mean credit card debt has increased from $2,169 in 2004 to $3,173 last year. But students who discussed credit card use with their parents were less likely to overspend, according to the report.  “Students indicated that they wanted more information about smart money management and they wanted it earlier than even college,” said Patricia Nash Christel, a specialist in saving, planning, and paying for college at Sallie Mae.Christel said the credit problems are related to rising college tuitions and lack of family savings. Many households are simply underestimating the cost of paying for college while the convenience of credit card use—especially online—provides a constant temptation for college-age students.Contrary to the findings of the study, Harvard students and affiliates have remained relatively unaffected by the trend of increasing debt. Gene Foley, president of the Harvard University Employees Credit Union, said, “On the Harvard campus, we have not really seen students [who] look like they’re getting out of control or getting into trouble with their credit cards.” Foley added that there has not been a spike in the demand for credit or requests for cash advances recently.  Foley said that part of this stability at Harvard is a result of the credit union’s attempts to maintain the limits it sets on student credit cards. The credit union arranges for financial literacy and education programs to teach students about the dangers of credit card abuse.However, Harvard has not been completely unaffected by the changes in consumer financial behavior. Although applications for credit cards at the Harvard union have not increased, the amount drawn from each card has risen, said Foley.In addition, Harvard students may be succumbing to the same temptations as other undergraduates across the nation. “There’s about 4 or 5 major credit card lenders, and some of them have preyed on students,” Foley said. He said that direct marketing to college-age students has resulted in the increased credit card usage and debt recently.  Nonetheless, Foley warned that the disadvantages of excessive credit card debt do not outweigh the advantages offered by this form of payment. “While students need to be cautious about credit cards, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have one,” he said.

The publisher of Rolling Stone magazine vehemently denied that print media was becoming obsolete before a crowd of eager students yesterday afternoon. “Let’s talk about the idea that print is dead,” the publisher, William Schenk, said. “I think it’s ridiculous.”While many periodicals have gone through a difficult period, Schenk said that magazines would ultimately survive because of their tactile nature.“When you put a beautiful glossy advertisement in a magazine, it creates an emotional connection that no other media can,” he said. “These kinds of ads...are beautiful; they’re glossy, they’re sensual in ways. I believe magazines will continue to be strong because of their ability to do that,” he added.Schenk told the audience that magazines should focus on producing content that readers will love.“My business manifesto is you have to be irresistible and you have to be loved,” Schenk said. “There’s tons of crap out there if you haven’t noticed. The magazines that people don’t care about are dying, and that’s a good thing I think.”Schenk defined a “great magazine” as one that engages different senses, praising Vanity Fair, The Economist, and New York Magazine for their ability to do so.“When I looked at a recent Vanity Fair cover, I could almost feel the fabric that was draped over the woman’s shoulders,” he said.Schenk also addressed people’s perception of Rolling Stone.“Some people think that we’re a music magazine, but we’re not,” he said. “We’re the voice of change, and that’s what we have to do.” But Schenk stressed the importance of marketing magazines to the consumer.“You need to think like a marketer,” he said. “We all need to sell. And I don’t mean it in the cynical sense, but its about creating something people want.”“Rolling Stone is not my magazine,” he added. “It’s the reader’s magazine.”Windsor G. Hanger ‘10 asked, “Is there any way to successfully monetize the online presence of a magazine?”  Schenk answered that a magazine has to “function like a magazine” and that the online world is more of a “wild west.”When one member of the audience questioned why Rolling Stone covers have become less interesting and edgy in the last five years, Schenk replied, “That’s a very incisive comment. We’ve fallen into a rut.”“If you saw the Gossip Girl cover, that was a complete result of my pushing,” he said. “If it sells well, I’ll get to do more of them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first major revisions to the Classics Department curriculum in at least three decades received final approval yesterday by a unanimous vote of the Educational Policy Committee, the Harvard board that reviews undergraduate programs. 
The changes, which will take effect in the fall, make the department’s offerings more accessible to concentrators and non-concentrators who have less experience with Greek and Latin.
The new curriculum reduces the department’s many tracks to two—a language-intensive track and a civilizations track. It also does away with the long-standing tradition of general exams for seniors based on a required reading list, while adding a junior tutorial to prepare students to write theses in subjects that may venture beyond literature.
In addition to its current courses, the department will offer more freshman seminars, 100-level courses, and eventually, General Education courses on texts in translation that will be appropriate for both concentrators and non-concentrators. The new curriculum also includes a secondary field focused on civilization studies that does not require any Greek or Latin language classes.
Director of Undergraduate Studies and Professor Mark J. Schiefsky, who guided the curriculum proposal approval process, said that the new system allows the department to offer a wider variety of courses.
“You can teach the history of Greek literature without Euripides’ Medea always on the reading list,” Schiefsky said, adding that in the past, courses that included texts not on the required list for general exams were guaranteed low enrollments.
Professor Richard F. Thomas, who will become the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the fall, said that Harvard’s move away from a narrow focus on language is part of a broader trend. “The degree in classical civilizations well matches intellectual directions the field is going in, opening up to pursuits additional to languages and literatures,” he said. “If you’re interested in a description of some myth in literature, obviously if there’s a sculpture or pictorial art of some sort that is dealing with the same issue, that can give a different point of view on a textual phenomenon.” 
Anne E. Austin ’10 is one of only two classics concentrators in the classical archaeology track, which is being replaced by the more general civilizations track. “I definitely think the changes will attract more people who don’t have experience with the languages,” she said. “I almost didn’t want to concentrate in classical archaeology because I didn’t want to take the general exams.” 
The new civilizations track will give students who would have specialized in classical archaeology the option to take the same courses to fulfill requirements. 
“It sounds a little more watered-down to me, especially for people who want to specifically study archaeology,” she said. “But at the same time, the change is largely nominal, and people will still be able to take the same classes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small contingent of students from Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement unfurled a protest banner and politely requested that the University avoid layoffs during an intimate lunch event with University President Drew G. Faust and seven Eliot residents.SLAM, a student organization that advocates on behalf of Harvard staff, interrupted Faust’s noontime meal with a warm welcome and round of applause. They then presented her with an open letter and an oversized cotton T-shirt.In the letter—addressed to the President and the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body—SLAM called upon the University to rehire all workers who have been fired since October 2008.“Harvard faces a choice: we can choose either to use our wealth in order to strengthen our community—students, faculty, and workers together—or to allow greed and fear to divide us and erode our institution of higher learning,” the letter read.In recent weeks, SLAM, whose Web site sports the slogan “GREED is the new Crimson,” has left pamphlets in Annenberg Hall while chanting “No layoffs!” SLAM members have also joined union members in protesting layoffs of nine subcontracted custodians at Harvard Medical School.“What we really want to encourage was the kind of dialogue that other institutions like MIT have, where students have input into where budget cuts can be made,” said Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-09, a SLAM member.To date, Harvard has not yet laid off any employees, but University officials have conceded that layoffs still remain a possibility pending a review of responses to the early retirement packages offered to staff members this spring.The 45-day period given to staff members at the Faculty of Arts and Science to accept the package ended on April 6.Aguilera said she hoped their efforts would raise awareness of labor issues within the Harvard community.“It’s not like the only thing we’ve done is bother Drew Faust in Eliot dining hall,” Aguilera said. “It’s all part of a bigger campaign.”After less than five minutes, the SLAM members left Faust to her Diet Coke and salad.One Eliot resident at the roundtable expressed confusion over the unexpected intrusion.“For a second, I thought those were people from Adams,” he said.Faust visited Winthrop House for lunch in February.—Staff writer Athena Y.

Undergraduate Council members remained in the dark about the effects of University-wide budget cuts on the College as well as the potential ramifications of these cuts for the January term session after yesterday’s town hall meeting led by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.Smith announced six working groups that would be charged with finding areas for cost-reductions throughout FAS. But according to Smith, it remains to be decided whether these committees would include students.Two committees, one dedicated to “student services” and the other to “academic” issues, will be formed to find cost-cutting savings at the College and will be composed of faculty members and staff. Two yet to be announced students will also “work closely” with these groups, according to the press release.Already structured programming for the “January Experience” has been a casualty of tightening budget constraints, and students and UC members have lamented that the decision may be shortchanging students.Student Affairs Committee Chair Tamar Holoshitz ’10 said that she found it “very frustrating” that students may not sit on the committees, especially given their direct relevance to student life.“I think going forward we need to make our message very clear that student involvement is necessary,” Holoshitz said.Members of the UC said that they have felt left out of the J-term decision-making process and have passed a “position paper” requesting that the College implement broad requirements for evaluating which students will be permitted to stay on campus during the month-long recess.Smith fielded questions from UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 about the level of student involvement in determining where budget cuts are to be made at the College, and from Parliamentarian Eric N. Hysen ’11, who asked for specific details about how the administration would handle the logistics of the J-term.Citing safety concerns, Smith said that all students will not be allowed to return to campus in January.“To have people coming back when college isn’t fully open doesn’t make sense to us,” Smith said in response to Hysen’s question.Both of Smith’s answers, in part, consisted of polite deferrals to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who was in attendance but did not speak.Hammonds is currently scheduled to attend a UC meeting on May 3, according to Kia J. McLeod ’10, UC vice-president. Smith has also been invited to that meeting.A contingent of students representing Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement were also in attendance at the meeting, accompanied by a large sign that read, “Greed is the new Crimson.org. No layoffs,” to which Smith commented, “Nice banner.”After the event Flores praised Smith for his willingness to answer questions from faculty and staff but said he needs to answer questions from the general student body “whose quality of life will be directly impacted by the budget cuts presented.”—Staff writer Eric P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Public School Committee unanimously approved the district’s $133.6 million budget last night, rejecting a late motion to restore cut funds to three educational programs run by outside non-profit organizations. The motion, which had been postponed from the Mar. 24 budget discussion, drew sharp disapproval from Mayor E. Denise Simmons, who said passing the proposal now would upset the already balanced budget.“I am extraordinarily disappointed that this is before us,” she said. “I cannot say that more emphatically. It has a budget impact that will not bode well.”Claire B. Spinner, chief financial officer for Cambridge Public Schools, said that there would be no way to increase the budget’s bottom line to accommodate expenses that had not already been accounted for.“In order for them to return the funding to those two community partners, we were going to have to go back and cut some line item,” she said. “I guess the rest of the school committee didn’t want to upset the apple cart.” The district faced a budget shortfall of about $2 million for the 2009-2010 school year, which prompted reductions in many areas—including $25,000 of funding for Breakthrough Cambridge and Cambridge School Volunteers, two of the educational programs addressed by yesterday’s proposal.The motion, which had been jointly suggested by committee members Patricia M. Nolan ’80 and Marc C. McGovern, failed by a 5-1 vote. Only Nolan voted in favor.Except for the mayor’s extended statement against the proposal, discussion among the committee members prior to the vote was brief.Simmons told the committee that she opposed the proposal because it had been introduced at an inappropriate time, not because she did not support the programs it would benefit. She also said that she thought it would be unfair to consider restoring funding for only these specific groups this late in the process. “To do it for one group means you should do it for all,” she said. “It is our job as guardians of the public till, as well as the public trust, to hold to what we said we will do.”The approved budget—which allots approximately $103 million to employee salaries and wages, $26 million to other ordinary maintenance costs, $1.4 million to travel and training expenses, and $3.3 million for extraordinary expenditures—has been forwarded to the city council for review.—Staff writer Michelle L.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to a looming deficit of $220 million for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences over the next two years, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith called for a broad-based restructuring of the University’s largest school at a town hall meeting yesterday.
Addressing faculty, staff, and student leaders gathered in Sanders Theatre, Smith proposed a shift from piecemeal budget cuts to sweeping changes in FAS structure to close a larger-than-expected budgetary gap.
“I do believe it is extremely important for us to think deeply about how we not only re-size our activities, which is most of what we’ve done today,” Smith said. “Now is the time to really start thinking about reshaping these activities.”
Smith also announced that 153 of the 521 eligible FAS staffers have accepted the early retirement incentive package, yielding a participation rate of about 30 percent—double that of a similar program recently conducted at Dartmouth. In the next few days, the administration will begin to analyze the savings of the program, which drew to a close Monday, according to Smith.
During the question-and-answer portion of the meeting, multiple audience members expressed concern about the possibility of staff layoffs. Though Smith did not explicitly presage job cuts, he said some FAS jobs may no longer be necessary, as he cited the “huge” deficit on the projector screen.
“I have no desire to do layoffs, but it’s increasingly likely as we work to reshape the environment, that we will not have a need for as many faculty or staff as we do today,” Smith said. “We’re going to have to address this new reality.”
Next year’s projected deficit of $130 million has been compounded by last month’s announcement that endowment funding for Harvard schools—which contributed 56 percent of the FAS budget this year—will fall 8 percent for the next two years, raising the two-year deficit even higher.
In response, FAS administrators have begun planning around a 12 percent decrease for the fiscal year ending in 2011 in case endowment funding plummets further, according to Smith.
“As you might imagine, this is a huge change—a painful change,” the FAS dean said.
FAS has already achieved $4 million of savings in the past six months, and proposals for 15 percent cuts submitted by departments and units would produce a $73 million reduction if approved for the next academic year. But the cuts would eliminate only one third of the overall deficit facing FAS.
Within the next two weeks, Smith said he will appoint six working groups charged with proposing cost-reduction measures for their respective areas in FAS—including the three academic divisions, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the College.
“These are not working groups put there to try to squeeze more efficiency from the system,” said Smith, who stressed that the groups would seek to make academic programs more cost-efficient while maintaining the quality of education.
“I’m looking for these groups to get together and think creatively, outside the box, with respect to how we can do things differently from an intellectual and academic point of view,” Smith added.
During the question-and-answer session, a few professors expressed frustration that the entire school has had to cut back in part due to a spending spree in recent years that focused on campus and faculty expansion.
“In retrospect, we would think that bubble money was not spent in the right way, and therefore we shouldn’t take the bubble money as the base from which we make cuts,” Government Professor Robert D. Putnam said, followed by a round of applause.
But Smith said that as the expansions had already taken place, such criticisms would do little to remedy the current situation.
“I’d be happy to get the information on what we looked like five years ago, but it’s a new time,” Smith said. “I think very much we need to reshape ourselves in terms of what we need to do in the future and not just what we were doing in 2005.”
Staffers interviewed after the meeting said that although they appreciated the open format of the town hall, they remained skeptical about Smith’s level of transparency.
“It was typically highly orchestrated, very controlled,” said library doorchecker Philip R. Fenstermacher. “There were a few good questions which Smith basically ducked.”
But some attendants said that the town hall meeting provided insight into the severity of the FAS deficit.
“We give Dean Smith many points for sitting there and taking these questions,” said Nancy L. Rosenblum, chair of the government department. “He was quite honest and told it like it was.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the question-and-answer session of yesterday’s town hall meeting, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith hosted a series of questions from concerned staff workers, perplexed professors, and student activists. Faced with a $220 million deficit over the next two years, every member of the assembly had some reason to worry.“Each of us represents his or her own segment of a huge, complex organization,” said Robert Darnton, director of the Harvard University Library. “And the questions naturally take the form of ‘What about me?’”Confirming his own observation, Darnton continued, “I have to admit, Mike, that I’m not different from others.”“I though you were going to surprise me now, Bob!” Smith replied.The library system was in a process of erosion even before the financial crisis, said Darnton, who worried that the cost-cutting measures of the next few years would compromise the importance of libraries on campus.But Darnton sought to stray a little from the mold of questions based on narrow interests, saying he was concerned for the library system on behalf of all of Harvard.“I think the library does represent the collective interest of the entire Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and beyond that, the entire University,” Darnton said.Smith got his surprise, after all.MAGIC OF NUMBERSAfter debriefing a nearly full Sanders Theatre about his two-year plan for meeting the deficit, Smith made clear just how steeped he has been in the tumult of FAS finances over the past six months—and his listeners were both grateful and perhaps even pitying.“I think all of us in this room have enormous sympathy for the challenges you have faced in this past year,” said Government Professor Robert D. Putnam. “I don’t think any of us would want to change jobs with you.”But Smith, who kept his cool during the meeting and even broke into a smile several times, appeared to be taking the financial crisis in stride, even if it has captivated his own interest.“I might pull it up,” he said as he searched his computer for a particular graph to answer a question from Putnam. “Because it’s so interesting,” he continued drily.ONE MORE TIMEJoseph Levy, a senior human resources consultant and associate of Adams House, stepped to the podium to ask Smith to clarify his priorities.“I think that staff would like to know that there’s a real person who has real priorities that will give them better insight into what is ultimately going to affect them down the road,” he said, donning glasses and a purple tie.Smith then proceeded to say that his priorities—faculty scholarship, undergraduate education, and the new General Education program—have not changed since he stepped into his office.Levy also thanked Smith for hosting the town hall meeting, a highly unusual gathering for faculty and staff.“This was very informative,” he said. “I hope you can come back next month and maybe we can do this again.”Leaning back against the wood stool, Smith smiled.“We’ll see.”—Staff writer Bonnie J.

Just spotted a suspicious looking person wearing shades and a trench coat hiding out behind Sever with what looked like a gun? Or someone crouching in the bushes of Quincy courtyard clasping a giant foam noodle? No need to get weirded out and call HUPD—FlyBy assures you (with reasonable certainty) that these people aren’t hitmen or lunatics, but are simply engaged in the game of Assassins.
Spring marks the time when various Houses launch Assassins, casting a pall of paranoia over the entire campus. So what can we expect to see, besides shady characters, broken friendships, and a dip in grades? Get a house-by-house breakdown after the jump.
 Leverett
Leverett’s game of Survivor—so dubbed supposedly due the House Master’s disapproval of the violent undertones of “Assassins”—began Monday at 8 a.m. and is being carried out in true Rabbit-style.
To eliminate their targets, students have to either poke them with a cardboard carrot measuring at least 8 inches, or pour hot sauce or vinegar into their target’s food without their noticing (ouch!), according to an e-mail from the Leverett HoCo social chairs.
Leverett also considers students safe “while actively drinking a green drink or eating broccoli.” Given the choice between imbibing PowerAde mixed with orange juice or death by carrot stab, though, FlyBy isn’t so sure if survival is preferable.
Conversations with Leverett residents reveal that a murderous spirit has already erupted.
“My target is actually my roommate,” Sam T. Steyer ’11 said before whipping around in his chair to peer around the dining hall for signs of said person. “But I plan to kill him today, so you can print this.”
Quincy
The intensity of Quincy’s “Assassins 009,” which began yesterday at midnight, is evident from a glance at its elaborate Web site, complete with rules, agents, “kill tallies,” and even a rumor board with tips about hiding locations and spottings.
In true People’s House-fashion, Quincy’s game isn’t pitting individual students against one another, but rather is assigning units of six students to target other units using foam objects—Nerf guns, pool noodles, foam fingers, and even yoga mats.
“I’ve just been sitting by my window all day to see if there were people I could shoot,” said Lizzie M. Moore ’09. “Academics have definitely suffered.”
Students won’t be able to avoid the d-hall in an attempt to stay alive—one of the central rules is that everyone has to attend one meal every day in Quincy.
The unabashed get an advantage in Quincy's Assassins game, thanks to a “Naked Rule” granting students who forego clothing immunity from elimination. That is, unless their shooter is naked, too.
Mather
Mather played Assassins during Reading Period in January, and with safe locations including the dining hall and house library, FlyBy initially expected the game to have dragged on for a while. Not so, however: a rule stating that participants had to kill their targets by midnight meant that the over 100 participants whittled down to merely a handful in only three days.
The final kill was “epic,” recounts winner Saul U. Gorman '09. After waiting over an hour outside his target’s locked door, Gorman finally managed to shoot a bullet from his dart gun through the narrow gap between the door and the carpet, hitting his unsuspecting victim's foot and earning eternal glory. Now that’s a true assassin.
Adams
If you've recently noticed spoons going missing from your dining hall or friends from Adams sweltering in their multiple layers and ski hats, look no further than Assassins for explanation. In Adams' game, eliminations occur by touching the target’s exposed skin or hair with a spoon.
Since Assassins began in Adams last Monday, FlyBy has been hearing sporadic cries of murderous assault emitting from the stately brick edifice. Well, not really, but the rules, which state that Assassins is meant to be “exciting, active, and paranoia-inducing,” certainly encouraged a spirit of merciless distrust.
A report of killings from Assassins coordinator William M. Skinner '09 reveals numerous tales of betrayal, teamwork, schedule-memorizing, faux ice cream dates, and over-dressing. “There was a lot of heartbreak,” says Skinner. “But I hope everyone’s patched it up by now.” But expect more heartbreak to come: as of today, a handful of students still remain in the game.
Eliot
Eliot House’s Assassins took place during Reading Period in January, the chilly landscape mirroring the icy, murderous hearts of its players. Assassins from Eliot certainly had the most number of choices for their method of elimination: weapons included water guns, water balloons, sharpies, and cardboard swords. Killings could also be accomplished via poisoning the target with Tabasco sauce or taping a note marked “pwnd” to the target’s body.
In a listing of death's on the game's Web site, Alexandra P. Greenfield '09 recounts her elimination of Tyler Caldwell '11:
“I was studying when spotted Tyler in the library. [sic] I waited, followed him out as he left, asked him what time it was, and shouted ‘Time to die!’ as I stabbed him with a sword crafted from a box of NutterButters.”
Pwnd, indeed.
 
Currier
Assassins hasn’t begun yet in Currier, but residents are already hoarding food in anticipation of dining hall avoidance. FlyBy might also recommend dressing down for a while, as water pistols are the weapon of choice, and the “target must be hit with water before they see the weapon,” according to last year’s rules.
Though instructions from last year say that tiffs and unsportsmanlike behavior are frowned upon, since Assassins “is intended to foster Currier House community,” FlyBy can already anticipate the mayhem that will soon consume the Quad. Pride and honor aren't the only things at stake—last year, $250 in prizes were given out.
"It'll be fun," says Aaron C. Fallon '09 '11. For a game that centers around killing and being killed, this just reaffirms the fact that Harvard students certainly have their own idea of what constitutes fun.

This weekend marked the opening of Tory Row at 3 Brattle Street, the former location of the Greenhouse Café (no, not that Greenhouse). The restaurant's name alludes to a nickname Brattle Street had during the Revolutionary War, when loyalists lived there.
The two owners, Chris Lutes and Matthew Curtis, are also the owners of Cambridge 1, Miracle of Science (down by MIT), and two other Boston restaurants. Described as “a restaurant with a European cafe feel,” Tory Row has created a good deal of hype on Boston food blogs, as other Lutes and Curtis restaurants have been pretty popular. Let's see if it lives up.
So far, there has been a steady stream of patrons eager to try out the new restaurant and bar (Well, half-bar...no liquor license means beer and wine only).  One employee noted that the place was even packed on a Monday night, unusual in the restaurant business.  It must be the pretentious sounding entrees like "confit duck salad" and "croque monsieur" that are drawing patrons into the sparsely decorated hotspot.  The European ambiance continues with the sliding storefront doors that open up onto a patio area.
Also soon to come: a breakfast menu!

And you thought the election ended back in November--Wrong! For those students from the great state of Minnesota the election has yet to end. You may have heard about the MN senate race. You know, the former funnyman (and Harvard grad!) versus the former Democrat. You probably just thought to yourself…oh silly Minnesota. Well, today  judges have declared Alan S. Franken '73 the new senator, but  knowing Minnesota, the drama isn't over yet.
Let's hear from  the denizens of the "Land of 10,000 Lakes" themselves after the jump.
 
 Let’s play catch-up for a moment. After election night, Senator Norm Coleman was ahead by 215 votes, a marginal “victory” triggered an automatic recount according to state law. 
 This recount took a few months to complete, resulting in a Franken lead of 225 votes. What caused the change? Over 300 rejected ballots were added. You may have seen on CNN and Fox in December and January that some absentee ballots voted for Franken but also wrote in (but without marking the write in choice option) for “Lizard People.” 
 All over right? Even some students who hail from the land of 10,000 lakes think it should be. “I think that’s over now right? Didn’t Coleman concede that?” Says Richard Liu ’11. Not so fast. Another pesky Minnesota state law does not allow the secretary of state to issue a certificate (granting formal victory) until all lawsuits have run their course. Senator Coleman has filed several lawsuits, the most recent of which actually resulted in increasing Franken’s lead to 315 votes. Now that the lower court has declared in favor of Franken, Coleman is going to the state Supreme Court, and if that fails, he may continue to the federal court system. 
 So why should you care? For going on 6 months, the state of Minnesota has not been given their right to representation. Now don’t discount this fact because you think Minnesota is the “boonies” or a “flyover” area. Minnesota has the highest voting rate in the country. 78% of eligible Minnesotans voted in the 2008 election.  Garrett J. Augustine ’10 feels that the whole process of judges deciding the election is to blame. “Whichever way it gets decided by the judges does not seem like the will of the people,” says Augustine. Clearly Minnesotans care about their elections. 
 The Minnesota senate race is the deciding factor in the Senate. It will make or break a Democratic super-majority. So, whatever party to root for, this race has clear salience. Plus, enough time as passed for the era of the 2008 presidential elections to be hip again.

It's no secret that in the world of Ivy League sports, most student-athletes will never set foot on a professional playing field in more than a spectator's capacity. Academics come first in the Ancient Eight, and because of that, the level of competition just isn't as high as it is in some other Division I athletic conferences.
But once a year, the Harvard baseball team gets to step into the cleats of its big league heroes on one of the national's pastime's biggest stages: Fenway Park. On Monday, the Crimson took its annual trip to Fenway to play against BC in the consolation game of the Baseball Beanpot tournament. While Harvard lost, 9-5, the opportunity to soak in the stadium's rich history and take the same field that has played host to some of baseball's greatest legends was not lost on the team. Watch the video after the jump for scenes from the Crimson's day at Fenway, along with reflections from Harvard players and some great anecdotes from the always entertaining Coach Joe Walsh:

Sasha and Malia Obama's  long awaited puppy, Bo, has finally made his White House debut yesterday amid the cattle herd that is the White House press corps.  But wait, a dog named Bo?  As in Barack Obama's initials?  With all the Harvard heavyweights manning the ship of state, no one could come up with a more creative name than Bo?  FlyBy thinks B.O.'s claims to membership of the academic elite are seriously undermined by his utterly unimaginative choice of name.
None the less, this Obama appointment, a 6-month old Portuguese Water Dog, has at least escaped the tax troubles that have dogged torpedoed previous high-level appointments.  That being said, the latest addition to the Obama team has not escaped controversy--those with nothing better to do critics clamor that the choice of a purebred dog exemplifies the shallowness of Obama's claim to bring "change" to D.C.
Deets and FlyBy's top picks for B.O.'s new dog's name after the jump.
Sancho Panza: America doesn't read.  The situation is depressing enough to warrant any and all measures--including sacrificing the dog's name to the literary gods.  Plus, B.O. needs a faithful companion to help his god-like boss tilt at windmills the financial system.
Karl: Class consciousness is depressingly low. The near collapse of the global financial system signals the inevitable clash of capitalist nations.  Time to publicly acknowledge it. What better way to begin a workers revolution than to name the dog after the Man himself?
Cristiano: How about first family honor the mutt's honorable heritage by naming the dog after one of the few good things Portugal has going for it?
Name aside and cuteness aside, Bo is likely to leave at least some feathers ruffled.  After Obama announced his intention to get a dog for his kids, discussion raged over the internet about what dog the first family should buy.  At one point, the family said they would buy a Goldendoodle, a mix between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle, but animal rights activists have clamored for the family to procure one of the millions of dogs in animal shelters. Shephard Fairey even deployed to help the cause.  FlyBy: "Seriously?"
Potential Upside: Judging by the rapturous response of the White House press corps, look for the White House to strategically deploy Bo to distract from this.
