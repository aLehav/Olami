After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ORDAINED FOR OBSOLESCENCE?
When the tape player became popular in the seventies, many missed the familiar graininess that was characteristic of record players, but the convenience of tapes was enough to allay their pining. The invention of the compact disc may have left a few audiophiles feeling nostalgic for the tape deck days, but the superior technology of the CD quickly helped them to forget. Today CDs are all but a memory, with music stripped of its physical vessel and distributed electronically as fluid content.
Whether books are bound to the same fate is unclear. On the other hand, decades into the information age, physical books still hold a central role in people’s reading habits. Walking across Harvard Yard, students can be seen carrying books and papers, but tape players and walkmans—even MP3 players—are a rare sight.
Why have records, tapes, and CD’s perished, while books remain prominent? One reason lies in the rich history of the book. While recorded music and film are still relatively young inventions, the book has been a significant part of modern history: Johannes Gutenberg created the movable-type printing press in the 15th century. Two centuries later, the Harvard Library—the oldest library system in the United States and the largest university library in the world—was established in 1638. Countless new technologies replace less sophisticated predecessors each year, the hot new product quickly erasing the old and obsolete from memory. When a technology has influenced a way of life for thousands of years, however, that erasure is less simple. Books are wrapped up in a sentimental familiarity that is difficult to betray.
While members of the Harvard community admit that electronic texts have many advantages over physical books, the act of reading—of turning a page, of holding a book in one’s hands—has kept the physical book at the center of the reading experience at Harvard and elsewhere. The book community at Harvard maintains that the book transcends its primary role as a vessel for letters and images and becomes more than a medium, an act of expression in itself.
COLLECTED WORKS
At the top of the central staircase in Lamont Library, in a display case overlooking the café, sit eight books. Students cannot check these books out of the library. Locked inside the glass case, the books remain unread, and out of reach.
The books are part of an exhibit on the Visiting Committee Prize for Undergraduate Book Collecting. Established in 1977, the prize is awarded to undergraduates who compete by writing an annotated bibliography of the books in their collection and an essay that describes the collection’s central theme. Whereas many Harvard prizes award academic writing, the book collecting prize puts students’ possessions at the fore. Initially, it may seem odd to award “[We ask students] what piqued their interest in starting to collect books…. Sometimes it was a gift, sometimes it was a book they saw in a store that they bought, sometimes it was a book that somebody had lent them and it struck them in some way, and then they began collecting books. And then it became a real concerted interest, a hobby,” Fliss says. “Sometimes [the collections] are built in very planned ways, and sometimes they sort of happen. They evolve, and gaps are filled.”
The physical book is at the center of the collections. Fliss emphasizes the intimate collection entrants had to their books, saying the physical collection is important because it is around people. She adds, “You have it in a set location in your house, in your room. People will talk about ‘Well, on my shelf I have these books together.’ And so I think it’s a reflection of you because you own them…. You’ve made that extra effort to acquire [the book], and it fits into that plan you have for the collection.”
The physical connection the collectors have to their books is perhaps most apparent in the exhibit on the third floor of Lamont, where some of the books of the second and third place winners are displayed. In one collector’s exhibit, a book is opened to its title page, where a circular embossed stamp displays the initials of the collector. “Her parents gave her the stamp,” Fliss says. “So there’s an extra physical, visual mark that this is part of her collection.”
In a book from another winner’s collection, small blue post-it flags peek out from between the pages. Another reader might have underlined sections she cared about. She might have highlighted. But this one chose blue post-it flags, announcing to all the unique, personal importance of those words, of that paper.
FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
Just a few minutes’ walk from the exhibits at Lamont, the printed word lives and thrives in a different way. Through the large wooden doors of Adams’ A entryway is The Bow & Arrow Press, home to a large letterpress printer. The Press was established in 1977 by a group of Harvard undergraduates who found a dusty letterpress while they were exploring the basement of Adams House.
Today, the press is available for use by Harvard affiliates through various open press nights and crash courses offered by a group of resident and non-resident tutors who oversee the press. L. Theodore Ollier, the non-resident tutor who leads the open press nights, emphasizes that the students’ work with the press is about more than just simple nostalgia. “We do want to preserve the craft of letterpress, but…I want people to create things here. It’s nice to have museum pieces, but you can’t do anything on museum pieces. You actually have to get them dirty,” Ollier says.
The printings that students create have a significance that is lost with automated printing. “The main draw for letterpress—the main joy—is that it’s hand-done…. You have to actually physically typeset,” Ollier says.
According to Ollier, it’s this intimacy with the printed word that keeps students coming back to the open press nights and crash courses. “What [students] start to realize, is that when they look at a book that was written in 1850 that was done in letterpress, someone actually had to come in and sit there and do that,” Ollier says.
HOW TO READ A BOOK
This fascination with the printed book as a physical object extends into the Harvard curriculum as well. Each Tuesday in the Robinson Hall Lower Library, another group of students sits down to better understand how readers have historically related to their books and how they continue to interact with books today. Their class is English 90ht/History 84e: “How to Read a Book,”  jointly offered through the History and English departments by David Woods Kemper '41 Professor of American History and Harvard College Professor, Jill Lepore, and Francis Lee Higginson Professor of English, Leah Price.
Here, students interact with the printed word in a number of unusual ways. For example, students’ notebooks and laptops are confiscated at the door. Each class throughout the semester brings a new note taking technique for which supplies are provided by Lepore and Price. For the first meeting of the course, students took notes on clay tablets. “There’s maybe [a] slightly hokey aspect of historical reenactment to it,” Price says.
The professors’ creativity also carries into the course projects. One such project is an oral reading of “Tristram Shandy” by Laurence Sterne, a book which Lepore described as self-conscious of its materiality. The work contains aspects that go beyond simple words on a page. One page, for example, is entirely black. Lepore and Price were unsure of what the students would produce when they were given the assignment. “What do you do with a black page?” Lepore asked. The results, however, were impressive. “It was so provocative and fascinating seeing how the students turned the text into voice,” Lepore says.
In order for students to appreciate the importance of the book’s format, Price utilized rather unconventional methods. During the first meeting of the course, one student agreed to partake in an exercise where she was blindfolded and asked to walk to a bookshelf and pull a book at random. “It turned out that by holding the book, by feeling the book, by smelling the book, by listening to the sound of the pages as they were flipped through, the blindfolded student actually figured out an enormous amount about the genre of the book,” Price says.
ELECTRIC FEEL
Harvard's curricular and academic emphasis on the value of physical books comes amid the rise of electronic readers and other technology. Certainly, the practical advantages that e-books offer cannot be ignored. With an e-reader, an entire library can easily be slipped into a large pocket. New books can be downloaded in seconds, and as a result, a world of books lays in the reader’s hands.
According to Russ Grandinetti, Amazon’s Senior Vice President for Kindle Content, customers choose digital books for quick access to a variety of books, portability, and features only available on electronic reading devices such as instant dictionary tools. As older books continue to be scanned electronically, e-readers become increasingly useful. “Today, many great books, especially out of print books, are now available only in digital,” Grandinetti writes in an email.
“Print and digital are not better or worse than the other—they do different things, and it’s great that people get to choose which best meets their needs,” Grandinetti emphasizes. For example, the cherished experience that many associate with browsing a bookstore is not available to everyone. “It’s also important to keep in mind that not everyone lives close to a bookstore, and even then those can only carry a limited selection,” Grandinetti says.
However, a book historian with no link to e-book interests—Price—argues that, while more traditional readers often point to the materiality of the book, e-readers, too are physical objects. For her, the differences between print and digital books lie in the experiences that they offer. “The electronic devices have their own materiality. They also have a feel, and a smell, and become landfill, and have a manufacturing process. They seem very immaterial but they are objects just as much as books are,” Price says. “If you dig deep enough, there’s always going to be some sort of dirty, messy, material thing at the bottom.”
Price and Grandinetti both seem confident that physical books and electronic books will be able to reach an equilibrium that allows for both formats. The dawn of e-readers is not something to be feared but to be celebrated, argues Grandinetti. “The expansion of digital means it’s a great time to be a reader—there is more to read than ever before, with different formats to choose from, whether digital or physical.”
THE CASE FOR BOOKS
It should come as no surprise that the walls of University Professor Robert Darnton’s office are lined with books. Darnton is the director of the Harvard University Library, Positioned across his desk, the bookshelves to the left contain modern volumes on a range of topics. The books to the right are much older. Mostly in French, these 18th century books each contain two stories: one on the pages, and one of the book itself. One shelf’s books, made from flaky pale blue paper and bound with deteriorating string, were the era’s equivalent of comic books.
Darnton moves past the shelf and begins to look for another book. “I always have trouble finding this one,” he says as his eyes scan the shelves. Eventually he pulls a small leather-bound book from one of the shelves. “You can open it,” he says. “But be careful, the cover is coming loose.” The book is small, like a prayer book, but inside, its secret is revealed. The book has been hollowed out and contains another, smaller book—only slightly larger than a box of tic-tacs. “[The larger book] is sort of a prayer book. It’s a devotional book. So you could go to church, and you’d be maybe bored. So you open your prayer book, and then you read this tiny little novel with pictures inside it,” Darnton explains.
In 2010, Darnton published an essay collection titled “The Case for Books.” In the introduction, he writes, “[This collection is] a book about books, an unashamed apology for the printed word.” For an unashamed apology, the book presents a very balanced argument on the state of the publishing industry and its likely future. Like Grandinetti, Darnton argues that e-books and physical books each carry their own sets of benefits and challenges, and the future of publishing will incorporate a healthy balance of each format.
Darnton admits that e-readers have improved since he published his book. “In general, I think that we will have more user-friendly electronic devices, and users will feel more friendly toward them,” Darnton says. And yet, he is dubious that e-books and physical books provide an equal experience. “I don’t think anyone understands how readers read yet…. We still don’t know what reading is. I think it’s still valid to argue that the sensory and sensual experience of reading a book, holding it in your hands, is extremely important.”
Like many readers, Darnton’s heart seems to be captured by the physical print book. The structure of Darnton’s book is telling. While his book’s subtitle is “Past, Present, and Future,” it is organized from future to past. The final images Darnton leaves with the reader emphasize the importance of the relationship between the reader and the printed book—images of frayed leather covers worn by use, pen meeting page, and hastily scrawled notes swirling in margins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To all fairy-tale aficionados, “Hansel and Gretel” is a familiar tale: Two children venture into the deep, dark woods for strawberries and end up narrowly escaping cannibalization by an evil witch. But when repackaged and presented as an opera—in English!—by the Harvard College Opera, this candy-sweet tale, which ran at the Agassiz Theater from Feb. 4-8, presented an impressively layered interpretation of the classic Grimm story.
Strong performances drove the performance of Engelbert Humperdinck’s classic opera. Hansel (Charlotte L. McKechnie ’15) and Gretel (Claudia D. Oh ’17), despite being far older than their counterparts in the tale, were convincingly innocent, mischievous, and child-like. The actors also brought complexity to their characters; for example, Hansel and Gretel’s brief bedtime prayer song as they fall asleep alone in the midst of the woods was a beautifully poignant portrayal of the feeling of being lost but finding solace in family. Additionally, Christina A. Bianco ’17, who played Hansel and Gretel’s mother Gertrud, depicted her character as more than just the original fairytale’s evil matriarch—after sending the children off to the woods to scavenge for food, she sang a riveting aria beseeching God for help and reluctantly put up with her husband (Matthew J. Vegari ’17)’s drunken antics.
The set was also impressively thought-out. From the rustic shambles of Hansel and Gretel’s home in Act I to the ethereal green of Act II’s forest to the garishly macabre colors of the witch’s gingerbread house in Act III, it provided a varied and compelling backdrop for the opera. The fluid set changes added a sense of spontaneity, almost magic, to the production—for example, the chorus of forest sprites efficiently dismantled the chairs and tables of Hansel and Gretel’s home and turned the stage into a soft forest clearing in the transition from Act I to Act II.
The live musical accompaniment by orchestral ensemble provided a fitting complement to the opera. Humperdinck’s opening score began slowly, a melancholy wash of sound that, when performed alone on the darkened stage, forced the audience to listen. The musicians blended the layered tones of the orchestra to set a tone and tell a story; it started heavy, turned briefly whimsical, and returned to its original gloom, just in time for the curtains to open. Throughout the opera, the musicians supplemented the opera and provided an aural landscape for the characters’ antics, whether it was Hansel and Gretel’s carefree strawberry-picking romp through the forest or the Gingerbread Witch’s near maniacal solo.
However, “Hansel and Gretel” was not without flaws. Despite the libretto’s translation into English, it was still at times difficult to understand the script, though that could be attributed to the style of opera itself. In addition, though there were many twists and turns that provided excitement and fresh takes on the story—for example, Hansel and Gretel’s encountering a benign, sleep-inducing Sandman and a gentle Dew Fairy before they stumbled upon the malicious Gingerbread Witch—a certain level of familiarity with the opera’s synopsis seemed necessary to fully grasp and understand it while watching in real time.
Despite the minor bumps, “Hansel and Gretel” was ultimately an impressive production. While it might not be everyone’s frolic through the woods, the production was certainly enjoyable and provided an interesting take on the classic Grimm fairy tale.

This past weekend, Canaday B entryway was a microcosm of typical freshman weekend activities—full of students on their way to Annenberg, doing laundry, or heading to the library to get a start on their next p-set—except for one room, where an entirely different scene was unfolding. “A Quiet Place,” written by Canadian playwright Brendan Gall and directed by Samuel A. Hagen ’18, ran over the weekend in Hagen’s dorm room, Canaday B-12. The room has a history of experimental theater: it was also used as a performance space by playwright, producer, and former resident, Randy Weiner ’87, of American Repertory Theater renown. Plays often rely on elaborate lighting, lavish costumes, and richly decorated sets to entertain; “A Quiet Place” featured none of these. But, in spite of some elements that made the play feel unfinished, this 80-minute production was never boring.
During the play, all signs of a college dorm room were erased. Black curtains covered the walls, and the set consisted only of a chair and single lightbulb. The play began in complete darkness. The light flickered on for a moment, and the audience saw a man doing pushups in the room. The light came back on, and a chair appeared in the room. The lights came up for a third time, revealing another man tied to the chair. What followed was an evolution of the relationship between two men, Henry (Thomas W. Peterson ’18) and David (Nicolas E. O’Connor ’17), stuck together in this black room without windows or doors. David initially seemed to be the victim and Henry his disturbed torturer, but the divisions between the two faded away as David realized that Henry was not his captor but an ally, imprisoned alongside him.
The premise of the play was utterly unrealistic—two men trapped in a room with no idea how long they’d been there, how they’d gotten there, or if they’d ever return to the lives they experienced before—yet they handled it in ways that felt completely familiar and even comedic. David taught Henry chess, Henry did tai chi (or a strange imitation of it), and they told each other stories about the life they remember before. Henry told a story about removing the heart of a tortoise and watching the animal writhe in agony, alluding to the characters’ own experience. The actors engaged in ordinary, even childish, activities as if they were in a normal situation, making a scenario that was completely impractical more accessible for the audience.
Peterson’s portrayal of Henry was superb; he managed to balance the elements of the character’s rationality and irrationality so that he seemed alternately relatable and deranged. He believably inhabited the character of someone who had indeed been living in a black room for an undefined amount of time. Peterson’s Henry clearly needed David’s companionship right away, but then grew to also admire and love him. Indeed, with the passage of time and the benefits of human company, Henry gradually emerged as the more sane part of the duo, beginning to comfort and reassure David. While at the beginning of the play the arrival of David sustained Henry, by the end Henry had become the influence that grounded David.
O’Connor also skillfully handled David’s transition from the outside world to the agonizing and endless life within the black room. At the beginning of the play, David despised Henry but eventually came to rely on him, a shift that O’Connor portrayed convincingly. The only dissonant note in O’Connor’s performance was that his entrapment didn’t elicit as dramatic a response as the situation would have seemed to invite. He was stuck in a black room without windows or doors, with a seemingly crazy man and no way to measure the passing of time; despite this, O’Connor’s David didn’t seem particularly upset or fearful for his life.
One of the most distinctive features of the play was its setting: a small space with an audience of only 12 per performance. The intimate staging was both one of the production’s greatest strengths and one of its weaknesses. The audience was so close to the actors that the show almost seemed to come to life—except when the single lightbulb illuminated the stage, the rest of the audience was also in the spotlight, intruding on the world of the play. While the use of Canaday B-12 has an interesting backstory, the production space made the play feel more like a dress rehearsal than a finished production.
The title “A Quiet Place” is a misnomer, as the production was driven forward by dialogue and the development of the relationship between Henry and David. The actors’ nuanced depictions of their characters were captivating, drawing audiences into their emotional life and their experiences within the black box. The play was so engaging that upon leaving the theater and entering back into the everyday college routine, it almost felt as if the door to the room had finally been found—as if Henry and David were finally free.

It is rare to meet an empress, especially one who has been married to one of the most notorious rulers in Chinese history. But for actress Joan Chen, her on-screen marriages to Emperor Puyi and Kublai Khan are all in a day’s work. After rising to superstardom in China as a teen, Chen became famous in America for her portrayal of Empress Wan Jung in Bernardo Bertolucci’s 9-time Academy Award-winning film “The Last Emperor.” Chen currently stars in the Netflix series “Marco Polo” as Empress Chabi and will be speaking at the Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations student conference on Feb. 16.
The Harvard Crimson: What was it like being a teen movie star during the Cultural Revolution in China?
Joan Chen: When I first started, it was the old studio system. I was plucked out of high school by Mao’s wife to star in her next film…. When [my second] film came out, I...became this overnight celebrity. The film was a propaganda film, and I was to be the role model for the proletariat youth. It was quite scary. I would get mobbed on crowded buses. We all had to shower in these public bath places, and to this day, I can remember nothing more terrifying than being mobbed when naked, going through puberty.... We were coming out of an era where few movies were made in China. There was no movie star culture. I was the beginning of it, so there was nothing I could reference.
THC: China’s box office has become a multi-billion dollar industry that invests not only in domestic films but also in Hollywood and American cinema. As an actor and filmmaker in both countries, how do you see this affecting the media landscape?
JC: The Chinese film market is taking off...which I think is enticing many U.S. film companies to try and make that one film that could be big in China. I even know of productions that include Chinese movie stars just for the Chinese version...but cut [them] out for the U.S. market. And this push for new content is coming from the Chinese companies as well. Just last year, I’ve been approached multiple times to direct films, which means they really need talent and people who can do cross-cultural projects. I know Asian-American directors who, for years, couldn’t get films made in the U.S. but are now fully financed in China.
THC: How has your experience starring in Netflix’s new series “Marco Polo” as Empress Chabi been?
JC: It was really great. When I first got the script, the character was not well-defined, but they included her because, historically, she was Kublai Khan’s wife. But as the writers and I communicated more, the character of Chabi got better and better.... Before “Marco Polo,” I hadn’t done a big U.S. project for a long time.... It just reminded me of what could be accomplished when you have that kind of budget and talent.
THC: You seem to play a lot of empresses. Do you find yourself typecast often?
JC: I say, “If you can be typecast, you’re lucky.” That means you’re still doing things and you’re still relevant. You have to be in the scene, on the screen, to make changes. So often I am given flat, boring characters in great, interesting movies. These roles are filled with stereotypes, and I have to work with the writers and directors and help them flesh out these characters. You can’t do that if you don’t have a role.
THC: Why did you choose to speak at the HPAIR conference?
JC: Harvard is an institution that I have great admiration and respect for, and working with students, the future leaders of this world, is one of my main passions at this stage in my life. So for me be at Harvard, speaking at a conference for international youth leaders, is such an honor for me.
THC: Are there any other ways you’re working to promote U.S.-China relations?
JC: I’m actually working on this very exciting project right now called “Youth Voices on China” organized by the 1990 Institute. We’re having students submit three-minute films about their views on what China means to them, China’s relevance to their generation, and how to improve U.S.-China relations.... It’s heartening to see so many kids interested in this growing field of influence. We want to promote positive connection between the two countries because this relationship is crucial and imperative to world peace and is going to be the narrative and the domain of the next generation.

“Those who can’t do, teach.” It’s an age-old mantra and one commonly rejected by artists who double as educators. But for award-winning cartoonist and comics theorist Scott McCloud, the saying has always rung a little true. “I wouldn’t necessarily have been making books about how to make comics if I’d really felt I knew how to make comics,” he says. It’s Feb. 5 and he’s sitting onstage at the Brattle Theatre, taking part in a talk presented by the Harvard Bookstore.
Of course, McCloud has always been better at the craft than he’ll admit. 1993’s “Understanding Comics,” his breakthrough work of comics theory, was in the form of a comic book itself, with a cartoon McCloud leading the reader through a kaleidoscopic and witty visual lecture. He also spent time writing the upbeat superhero saga “Zot!” and wrote several issues of a Superman series for DC.
If you ask McCloud, though, he never felt totally comfortable with his skills—that is, until writing “The Sculptor,” his first-ever narrative graphic novel, which was released on Feb. 3. A 500-page hardcover epic, “The Sculptor” took five years to create; it’s a sprawling story about love, art, and a struggling artist who gains superpowers through a pact with death. Producing the book was a trial by fire—“Failure was not an option,” McCloud says—but it was also a chance to put the devices he’d been writing about for years into practice. The challenge, though, was trying not to seem over-intellectual, to hide all his conceptual tricks under a streamlined story.
“I wanted to take all the techniques, theories and tools, and analytical rubrics and whatnot, and use them—but then bury them,” McCloud says from the stage. Behind him, projected onto the Brattle’s massive screen, are panels from “The Sculptor.” The lines are crisp, the faces simple but emotive. A party scene is split into tiny panels that seem to cascade wildly down the page—that is, until McCloud hops out of his chair and points excitedly at the screen, revealing that even the most loose-looking pages are formatted on a strict grid.
“If I’ve done my job right, when you pick up this book and start reading, it’s going to suck you in,” he tells the audience. “By the third page, you’re not going to know that you’re looking at ink or color or paper or panels or transitions or anything. You’re just going to see people, places, stories until you’re done.”
Hours later, McCloud is in the basement of the Harvard Bookstore, signing a few final autographs. Even in the midst of a hectic press tour, he still makes time to crack jokes with the eager comics fans who have stood in line for his signature. Several times he reassures them that “there’s no way I’ll miss Comic-Con this year,” usually followed by a glance towards his wife, Ivy, who is never far away from the signing table. “The Sculptor” is about formal experimentation, to be sure, but it is even more about her.
McCloud pushes aside the mountain of books he has just signed and tells me about the story’s origin. “The Sculptor” may have taken five years to write, but its plot had been gestating for five times that. McCloud, who hails from Lexington, Mass., first dreamt up the idea of a super-powered sculptor sometime in high school. One of many whimsical ideas from his formative years, the concept ended up on the backburner. Then, in his early 20s, McCloud fell in love.
“The romance [subplot] was largely inspired by this young woman I was in love with, but couldn’t tell anyone about,” he says, referring not-so-subtly to Ivy, who is chatting with friends nearby. “She became an integral part of the story.” It wasn’t long before McCloud combined his own story with the sculptor idea, but putting it on the page was another matter. “I liked it, but I thought [it was] kind of a serious superhero story, which is really one of the most appalling of the subgenres,” he says. “But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that there was something powerful about the basic plot, and it kept tugging at the back of my mind for decades—literally decades—until I decided to give it a run.”
Though the book is based partly on McCloud’s young adulthood, his protagonist, David Smith (yes, the reference to the other sculptor by that name is very intentional), is in many ways the author’s opposite. Where David works in a state of mindless passion, McCloud is a strict and diligent formalist. While David never seems to get a break, his creator is a celebrated award-winner.
But McCloud is quick to mention how much luck has played into his own trajectory. “I try not to take my luck for granted,” he says. “That’s what I tried to do with this book: to work really hard and to take advantage of the opportunity to just sit and draw for five years. That’s something that not every artist gets to do.”

“Our relationship with architecture today...comes from this moment in Modernist architecture when visionaries like Corbusier thought it could…revolutioniz[e] the way people inhabit space,” says James Voorhies, director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. Curator of the center’s most recent exhibit, Voorhies felt inspired to make some additions to the Corbusier-designed center. According to Voorhies, he came across the idea from inhabiting the center on a regular basis, constantly questioning its design and learning about its history, with the “The Way We Live Now, Modernist Ideologies at Work” as the product. This collection of films, pieces, and structures intends to fascinate as much as it challenges visitors to reconsider how they view and feel about their own surroundings.
The exhibition includes various architectural additions to the center that, from a quick glance, seem a natural extension of the building itself. It is difficult to distinguish what is being exhibited and what is not, for the center is its own piece of art. “That’s the beautiful part of this space. You don’t know you’re walking into an exhibition. You are not aware that your confrontation to this art begins at that moment, as opposed to when you walk into a museum when you are in a position to say ‘OK, this is art,’” Voorhies says.
Cerith Wyn Evans’s “Untitled (Column), 17,” which is featured in the exhibit, is a column comprised of more than 80 fluorescent light bulbs. Modeled after the Corbusier pilotis, or pylons, that support the center, Evans’s structure is naturally installed in the middle of the open lobby space. The lights coalesce into a white beam, emanating a glow that spreads from the center of the room. The work complements the plate-glass window design of the center, and its reflection bouncing off the glass walls generates the illusion of even more pilotis. “It doesn’t seem like it is part of an exhibition that isn’t normally there. It just fits in the space,” says Veronika Polakova, a visitor from the Harvard Law School.
Its natural integration, however, serves an even larger purpose than providing a source of light. “The illuminated column is completely impractical…. But it points out and emphasizes the importance of the use of pilotis in the building,” Voorhies says. “The column in modern architecture allows for the weight to be bared throughout the space as opposed to the walls on the exterior.”  According to Voorhies, form follows function and these purposeful columns simultaneously raise the building off the ground and generate openness in the interior.
Another piece of the exhibition, “Re-Make/Re-Model,” was uniquely conceived in the Carpenter Center by artist Amy Yoes. Her inspiration emerged from a site visit to the center; while looking out at the outdoor sunken plaza on Level 1, she saw an opportunity to make her own mark on the building. “Re-Make/Re-Model” is not a permanent change to the foundation but rather a simple modification to what Corbusier initially established. “I wanted to use this seating plan as the base structure for a sculptural intervention that would be using some of the conventions of modernism and the attraction to formal geometric forms,” Yoes says. “I created these shapes that are interlocking with the structure and painted them a very similar gray to the concrete that it almost feels inevitable.” Yoes strives for modesty, to show off and complement the center rather than conceal it.
What distinguishes Yoes’s work is the hybrid use of film projection onto the gray, geometric wood structures. On the surfaces, animated white lines and dots move around, disappearing and reappearing. According to Yoes, these animations are meant to enhance. “These animations...emphasiz[e] certain aspects of the dimension of the piece...as if the lines were searching for the form,” Yoes says. “Yet with the lines chasing each other and the flickering dots there’s a witty nod to the flickering marquee.”
Yoes’s piece is only one instance in the exhibit where animation and film provide unique ways to experience modernist architecture. Another piece, Elizabeth Price’s “At the House of Mr. X,” blends dynamic shots with a choral soundtrack that imbues the interior and objects of Stanley Picker’s home with austerity in spite of its luxury. Yoes similarly says that film plays an integral role in the experience of her structure, emphasizing its scale and form. “I love the word animation because it means bringing life,” Yoes says. “It’s all about searching, and looking for movement…They [the lines and dots] have a lot of personality, even if they’re just lines and dots chasing each other.”
According to Voorhies, the event is about generating a consciousness of the spaces we inhabit, to think beyond their utility. “Of course I understood this before arriving, but it becomes more evident how important the building is and the impact it has on the way we inhabit it and the way work is presented in it,” he says. “The Way We Live Now” highlights not only the recent achievements of artists, but also the Carpenter Center’s beauty in its elegant simplicity.

“I wake up thinking [I’ll give a lap dance] most mornings, and today, it was finally fulfilled,” actor Chris Pratt said at a press conference last Friday after receiving his Pudding Pot from the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. Moments earlier, the actor had performed a lap dance on stage during his roast. At another point in the roast, he sang “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” with modified lyrics to befit his alien duet partner (played by Joshuah B. Campbell ’16). He cut chopped pieces of wood in response to challenges made by a karate man (played by Sam B. Clark ’15) and Ron Swanson (played by Paris K. Ellsworth ’15). He even listened to digs at his career, marriage, and supposed method acting by Hasty Pudding co-producers Zoe B. Rosenthal ’16 and Joshua J. Friedman ’16.
Afterward he sat in front of photographers and reporters, speaking into a microphone, the shutter sounds of cameras competing with his voice. While the atmosphere was formal, Pratt infused the conversation with playful humor and geniality. “The whole thing was a blast and a riot. These guys [in the Hasty Pudding] are hilarious,” he said of the lap dance. This year’s recipient of the Pudding’s Man of the Year Award, Pratt is well known for his work as Andy Dwyer in television comedy “Parks and Recreation,” but only recently did he achieve renown as a Hollywood heavyweight. After headlining two of the highest grossing blockbusters of 2014—“Guardians of the Galaxy” and “The Lego Movie”—the actor landed a lead role in the upcoming “Jurassic World” and is rumored to be replacing Harrison Ford in the next installment of the “Indiana Jones” franchise.
While acting is Pratt’s forte, the first topic of discussion at the conference was not art. Instead, the Super Bowl and Pratt’s lost wager with fellow actor Chris Evans (each actor promised to visit a hospital of the other’s choice if his Super Bowl team lost) found the spotlight. Rather than focusing on his loss, Pratt found humor in the situation by referencing Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson’s controversial comment that his faith gave the team a win over Green Bay. “I believe in God, and I think that He’s not in the business of proving that He’s real. And if the Seahawks were to win the Super Bowl, everyone would know for sure that there is a God…. Life would be meaningless,” he said, to erupting laughter among the crowd of reporters.
Pratt soon turned to talking about his acting. Regarding his work on “Parks and Recreation,” he discussed the improvisational comedy prevalent in the show’s script. Pratt said his favorite improvised joke occurs in third season episode “Flu Season”: after trying to understand the root of Amy Poehler’s character’s sickness, Pratt’s character says, “Hey Leslie, I typed your symptoms into the thing up here, and it says you could have network connectivity problems.”  His work with CGI characters, both in “Guardians of the Galaxy” and in “Jurassic World,” also received attention. For Pratt, working with major CGI characters was not unlike working with people, especially if the film has an adept director. “When I was talking to Rocket or Groot, I was talking to a real actor. I was crouched down. I was having a real interaction any time that I could,” he said.
While Pratt could neither confirm nor deny the rumors related to Indiana Jones, he affirmed that, while he loved the franchise, he would make any film decisions carefully. “Just like anything I’ve been a part of...I wouldn’t be comfortable signing onto it unless I felt like I was going to do the franchise justice,” he said. Pratt’s future plans are not restricted solely to films and television, however. He hopes to use his recent successes as a means of giving back to the community and helping children—a plan that he is already fulfilling with his recent visit to Christopher’s Haven, a Boston hospital and home for children with cancer. The consequence of Pratt’s losing bet with Evans, the experience was rewarding for Pratt. He said he planned to continue visiting other hospitals, including the Seattle Children’s Hospital with Evans.
As Pratt gave advice for aspiring young actors, he stressed the importance of believing in yourself, even more than having a desire to achieve the dream. That way, he explained, you would be persistent despite barriers to your success. Coming from the man who faced many failures to achieve his current stardom—he had read for the lead roles in “Star Trek” and “Avatar” but did not get either part—the advice was poignant. “You need to rely on your belief that what you’re doing is what you’re supposed to be doing,” he said. And as he posed for the photographers, lips kissing the Pudding Pot, it was apparent that his belief had truly taken him far.

Chilean novelist Alejandro Zambra hardly needs further proof that he is adept as a miniaturist, one of those authors who revel in flash fiction’s power—his award-winning debut “Bonsái” was only around 90 pages. The writer’s latest work, “Mis documentos” (My Documents), functions as both a departure from and affirmation of the pithiness attributed to Zambra. At 241 pages, the collection of short stories seems immense in size compared to his previous books, but each of the 11 tales occupies a small space, which allows Zambra’s concision to show fully. It is this construction that makes “Mis documentos” so memorable and masterful. Through recurring images and themes, the author creates worlds both separated from and interconnected with one another—worlds from different times shaken by waves of the same sweeping political and social changes. Though his stories focus on people confronting very unique situations, Zambra harnesses the short story form to weave narratives that, while written concisely, display powerful acuity about the characters and their experiences.
At its roots, “Mis documentos” is primarily an exquisite introspection into daily life. ‘The opening short story, “My Documents,” follows a young Chilean man’s life, beginning at his childhood—specifically, at home and church—and reaching up to his present adulthood.  Here, Zambra takes the coming-of-age concept and ladens it with nostalgic wisdom to create a heartwarming fiction. Even when a story’s plot contains less mundane events—“Thank You” involves the abduction and robbery of a couple in a taxi—Zambra treats the story with heavy, reflective weight and little sensationalization. “The Argentine and Chilean One tell the Spaniard what happened,” a narrator says, describing the fallout of the abduction, his disinterested tone muting the drama. Stories like “Thank You” prove that, despite the diverse narratives presented, “Mis documentos” is consistent; each piece complements every other through Zambra’s treatment of the various topics.
Zambra further ensures this coherence through his balanced style: his language is not trite or overdone but instead manages to find equilibrium between simplicity and complexity. Regardless of the point of view, the narrator describes the story’s events clearly. Zambra enlivens his language at certain intervals, however, to electrify scenes with more vibrancy—distinct moments against the straightforward nature of the rest of the book. As a habitual smoker reflects on his decision to quit smoking in “I Smoked Very Well,” he declares: “Cigarettes are the punctuation marks of life. Now I live without punctuation, without rhythm. My life is a stupid avant-garde poem.” The comment, which seems to suggest the dangers of acting under social demands, is distinct not only because of its rarity but also because it bears hints of significant social commentary. Juxtaposed against the less colorful writing of the rest of the narratives—writing that describes situations and people with few metaphors or unique vocabulary—these moments have strong historical resonance. Zambra comes across as a provocative storyteller, aware of the gains coming from manipulating his language and committed to a greater purpose than entertainment.
But what really makes Zambra and “Mis documentos” so incredible derives not from the precision of each narrative but their collective result. Recurring themes—religion, homosexuality, family, and love among others—connect the varied plots together, giving them all more substance. Zambra is not explicit in projecting his opinions but implies them through the characters and their experiences. In this way, he creates a book with many complicated layers that slowly unravel and add to the collection’s depth. “My father was a computer, my mother a typewriter,” the narrator says at the end of “My Documents.” Six short stories later, the narrator of “I Smoked Very Well” intones, “I’m an old but not entirely broken computer.” Both instances reveal the prevalence of technology—a leitmotif already hinted at with the book’s title, which could refer to the My Documents folder of a computer. These sparse hints reach a climax with “Memories of a Personal Computer,” a narrative focused on a love that blossoms and dies due to a computer and a story that serves to define Zambra’s critique on society’s uplifting but also destructive dependence on technology. Moments like these, when clear connections form between the varied stories, empower “Mis documentos” and grant it profundity.
Politics also lines the pages, an initially hidden presence that gradually grows more assertive. In “Camilo,” after the titular character causes a commotion, the narrator notes, “He had disrupted the public order, we were living under a dictatorship, but Camilo managed to placate the policemen, and we walked away after making the strange promise never to laugh in a public place again.” Zambra intersperses the brief mention of Chile’s government in a long sentence. Placed among more inane phrases, the revelation of dictatorship occupies a forgettable position, one capable of endowing little weight. The scene is one of many throughout the novel where Zambra presents the politics—namely the tumultuous state of a former dictatorship—as a negligible but nevertheless significant aspect of the characters’ lives. This political context concentrates Zambra’s focus on day-to-day events with greater meaning: the politics become a part of the characters’ lives. While Zambra’s political allusions assumes prior knowledge of Chilean history, which can oftentimes become isolating for an unfamiliar reader, his continual repetition and reference to certain events is enough to suggest the topic’s gravity.
These insightful political and social attributes of “Mis documentos” ultimately reflect Zambra’s deftness as a miniaturist. He knows when to employ simplicity and when to highlight certain details, and he understands how to grant individual stories their own flavor while maintaining their connectivity. Through his close attention to detail and careful construction, Zambra manages to connect a seemingly hodgepodge collection of beads into one cohesive work of art until each story merges into every other with the same purpose—one of introspection and commentary.

A mysterious plague kills everyone who reaches adulthood. Children struggle to survive, scavenging among the ruins of modern civilization. An army bent on domination marches across the world. A girl sets out, against all hope, to save her people.
This narrative framework sounds all too familiar, tempting one to lump Sandra Newman's most recent novel, “The Country of Ice Cream Star,” in with the many trendy dystopian novels aimed primarily at young adult audiences. Yet in telling the story of Ice Cream Star, who sets out to find the cure for the “posies” that will kill everyone she knows when they reach the age of 20, and Pasha—a deserter from the imminently approaching Russian Federation Army who befriends Ice Cream and appoints himself her protector—Newman manages to craft a story that sets itself apart from the less inspired works crowding the genre.
Two aspects distinguish Newman's work from others in the recent deluge of dystopias. First, despite being about children and teenagers, “The Country of Ice Cream Star” is clearly not written for a teen audience. Violence is frequent, often treated with insouciance, and depicted in excruciatingly graphic detail—this is “Lord of the Flies” on steroids. Sex is also abundant, with none of the shy agonizing over a single kiss that plagues so many teen novels. It might be tempting to compare 15-year-old Ice Cream to the strong female leads currently popular in dystopian fiction, but heroines like Katniss of “The Hunger Games” fall far short of the unadulterated toughness that is the assault rifle-wielding Ice Cream. Not to mention that Ice Cream is able to sustain a mature and complex friendship with Pasha, despite their differences—she is a young African-American girl, he a 30-year-old white foreigner who is somehow immune to the plague.
The other feature that sets “The Country of Ice Cream Star” apart is its brilliantly inventive use of language. Following in the footsteps of “Riddley Walker” and “A Clockwork Orange”, novels that played with the possibilities of dystopian language, “The Country of Ice Cream Star” is written entirely in a dialect of English that has evolved 80 years after disease eliminated all adults and the entire white population of North America. This is an incredibly ambitious linguistic undertaking, yet Newman manages to maintain the consistency of this dialect over the novel's nearly 600 pages. Even more impressively, after only a few pages the language begins to seem natural and—rather than being a burden—reveals its potential to be intensely lyrical and expressive. Clever word choices, such as the almost exclusive use of the word “child” instead of “person,” lend a solidity to the reality Newman creates. Metaphor emerges organically, seemingly a natural linguistic tendency of the children in this world; statements like “children forgot the taste of hunger and the touch of fear,” and “like magic tricks, my contradictions hush,” which might otherwise come off as self-consciously figurative, blend neatly into the text. Newman’s conception is also particularly suited to creating beautifully raw descriptions of Ice Cream's emotions and of the horrors of everyday life in her world. Of the disease that claims her people's lives as they approach adulthood, Ice Cream tells us, “And all their face and skin eat up by red and blackish posies. Posies scabbing and they open into sores and horrors. Posies grown inside and outside, blackish death put roots into your body and its flowers bloom.”
If there is any weakness in “The Country of Ice Cream Star,” it is that it tries too hard to do too many things. Newman seems driven by a compulsion to ensure no dystopian trope is neglected; on a disease-torn continent the action moves from the warring clans of “Massa Woods” to a New York governed by an absolute theocracy based on a twisted form of modern Catholicism to a completely militarized and heavily fortified Washington, DC. To that Newman includes an invading foreign army and an elusive cure for the ubiquitous disease. Meanwhile, Pasha recounts the ills that plague the rest of the world: nuclear attacks, endless imperial wars, rampant drug addiction, sexual slavery, and child soldiers. Individually, each of these vivid episodes seems skillfully composed; strung together they become somewhat exasperating and sluggish, with each new complication requiring extensive exposition.
Newman’s linguistic style isn’t entirely successful, however, and it can feel burdensome in the midsection of the book. While it often lends itself to fresh and inventive writing, Ice Cream's dialect occasionally produces unnecessarily drawn-out descriptions of setting and somewhat stilted retellings of action scenes. These minor flaws are magnified when the plot begins to drag. The action frequently pauses as other characters tell Ice Cream of events that occurred elsewhere. Unfortunately, these interludes are all written in Ice Cream's voice, as if she is telling the story of herself hearing a story, despite the fact that narrative would benefit greatly if such passages were used as a means to develop the voices of other characters.
Additionally, Newman tries to pack in far more social commentary than the storyline can effectively sustain. Some of these efforts are successful. For instance, Ice Cream's relationship with Pasha deftly comments on attitudes towards those who differ from us; even as the two become friends, Ice Cream is occasionally surprised to realize that he is just as human as she is. Pasha teaches her to speak Russian, and she muses, “Always be surprising, that these words work just like speech.” In other places, however, the attempts are glaringly unsubtle—it's certainly possible to guess that the story is partially an allegory for the colonization of Africa, without a girl lecturing Ice Cream not to trust white foreigners because slavery is bad.
Despite these flaws, persistence through the slower sections of the novel pays off, as Newman accomplishes the difficult feat of creating an ending that is both surprising and satisfying. The tale follows Ice Cream and Pasha through so many twists and turns and is packed with so much rich detail of their world that it is easy to become emotionally invested.  The magnitude of that attachment, though, might not become apparent until the story's ending unfolds in a spectacle of danger, betrayal, and—perhaps—redemption.

Half of the hustle and bustle surrounding arthouse cinema can be generalized in one sentence: put some fancy terms like identity, modernity, and duality together with nudity, and you will get a stereotypical western-European art film; put some fancier terms like oppression, rebellion, and religion together with nudity, and you will get a stereotypical Asian or Eastern-European art film. In this sense, “Leviathan” falls nicely into the latter pattern. It decries a relentless government machine, portrays struggling helpless individuals, sneers at the corrupt Orthodox Church, and offers a moderate amount of nudity. Nevertheless, these clichés are balanced by director Andrey Zvyagintsev’s mastery of visual language and narrative power, which save the film from mediocrity.
Kolya (Aleksey Serebryakov), owner of an auto-repair shop in a small Russian town, is about to lose his house due to a construction project that will benefit the corrupt mayor. Teaming up with his lawyer friend Dmitriy (Vladimir Vdovichenkov) and his wife Lilya (Elena Lyadova), he decides to fight the mayor through a lawsuit. The plot resembles that of many recent films, such as “This Is Not a Film”, “Timbuktu,” and especially “A Touch of Sin,” whose first 30 minutes have a story almost identical to that of “Leviathan.” To make it worse, this clichéd story is written in a direct, almost unvaried way. To demonstrate the confrontation between the individual and the system, the screenwriter simply shows Kolya telling Dmitry and Lilya that they will beat the mayor, and shows the mayor bragging, “You are all insects.” Later in the film, probably in an effort to make the conflict more complex, the screenwriter adds another worn-out storyline: Dmitriy starts to have a secret affair with Lilya. This stands in contrast to the originality of other recent films on similar themes.  “This Is Not a Film,” has the unique perspective of a film director telling how he is banned by his home country; “Snowpiercer” puts different social classes into train carriages; and “A Touch of Sin” uses multiple narratives to enrich its volume. Immediately, the predictable and uninventive script of “Leviathan” prevents it from becoming a great film.
Fortunately, “Leviathan” partly balances these shortcomings in its story with director Andrey Zvyagintsev’s command of cinematic language. Frequently in the film, the visual image serves a strong narrative purpose or externalizes the characters’ state of mind. For example, in the climactic scene, the protagonist’s house is suddenly torn down by huge claws of excavators, right after he has been taken away for a homicide that he did not commit. From inside the house, the director presents the audience with two minutes of delicate still shots detailing how the excavator abruptly breaks through the wall out of complete silence, how the claw contemptuously shuffles away the dining table that the main character has used for years, and how the whole two-storey building disappears in two minutes. Then silence returns. Here the government machine is vividly visualized as the dreadful mechanical claws, and the individual is ground to rubble. In another shot, a car rushes in fog towards the scene of an accident. The car stops, and the characters get out. The camera stays in the car, and shows the windshield wipers clearing up the window bit by bit, until the character finds out the horrible truth. Such elegant and sometimes minimalistic scenes speak louder than words.
Zvyagintsev’s mastery is also evident in the film’s small details. In one scene when the protagonist is waiting for a government clerk to respond, another clerk is shown playing solitaire on his computer. In another scene the main character runs into the local priest in the supermarket, and the latter, looking just like any ordinary, middle-aged man, responds awkwardly to questions. Such details give the lackluster story a layer of authenticity, and give a glimpse into an immense corrupt system that extends far beyond what confronts the main character.
“Leviathan” has an interesting duality: as much as its story is unimaginative and bland, its visual language is rich and well-crafted. In the end, it stands out of the crowd but still has a ways to go to be considered a true masterpiece.

In my first few weeks of college, I ran for Chinese Student Association freshman representative. And no, I did not win. Thanks for asking, though.
As the race got underway, I asked myself many questions about why I was running—mostly because I had to write a candidacy statement explaining why I wanted to run. In doing so, I realized how complicated my relationship with my heritage is.
My father has been exiled from China. Sounds pretty bad right? “What did he do?” some people ask me, horrified. “He must’ve done something terrible!”
I suppose he has, if you consider supporting democracy and free speech a crime, which evidently the Chinese government does. My father was an activist in the Beijing Democracy Wall Movement in 1979 and he was the former president of the Chinese Alliance for Democracy. Now he lives in America, but he continues to write pro-democracy material. My mother and I are free to travel to China to visit relatives, but he is not.
Unsurprisingly, this makes my relationship with my heritage a little awkward, a little uneasy. This discomfort comes up anytime I am confronted with my racial identity—naturally, when I was running for CSA, but also in the most unexpected of times.
A while ago, I stumbled upon the trailer of “21 and Over.” Much to my surprise, the protagonist was an Asian male. It was somewhat astonishing to me that an Asian person would be playing the lead role in a movie—particularly one containing no martial arts. I was able to clear up this mystery after a few Google searches: The producers of the film wanted to expand into the much-coveted but elusive niche of moviegoers in China. Many things are censored in China—dangerous, threatening, potentially revolutionary things—including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. After many years of trying to force their movies into China and getting them censored or banned over and over again by the government, Hollywood producers have finally learned. This is why, in America, viewers will be seeing “21 and Over” as a funny, albeit coarse, depiction of what happens when an Asian-American college student’s 21st birthday lands on the day before an important medical school interview. In China, viewers will be seeing a movie about a transfer student from China who is briefly exposed to the hedonistic West’s ways before returning home as a reformed individual who embraces his roots.
Yes, Hollywood will shoot two separate movies—one for China, and one for the rest of the world.
I find this deeply troubling. For my family, and for many families, America is the bastion of freedom. That’s why my parents moved here, and that’s why my father is continuing his work in this country. Freedom of speech is particularly important for my family, given that my father has been exiled for exercising this right in a country that does not recognize it as such.
The fact that Hollywood is censoring itself and effectively relinquishing its freedom of speech—a freedom that most Americans take for granted—to placate the Chinese government says a lot about what it’s willing to give up. But I don’t think anything is worth giving up freedom of speech. It is an unalienable right that can’t just be granted or taken away depending on the situation.
This, then, is the source of my dichotomy. On the one hand, I am Chinese, raised in a Chinese household, and that is undeniably a huge part of my identity. But on the other hand, I am American. I was born in this country, educated in this country, and I believe in the core values that make up the foundation of this nation—democracy and free speech. I may be Chinese ethnically, but at heart I consider myself American.
And yet to identify myself as purely American would also be wrong. Time and time again, I am reminded that, no matter how “American” I think I am, I am not quite there. It doesn’t matter that I was born in this country, that English was my first language, that I was educated in the American school system. Strangers walking down the street call me “dirty commie,” criticize me for not knowing how to act “in this country,” and, again and again, implore me to “go back to where I came from.”
I am Chinese-American, but I cannot fully embrace both aspects of my identity at the same time. I have to choose one or the other. Perhaps I should feel greater loyalty to my country of origin, where I suppose I would more fully “belong.” (Surely, no one would tell me to “go back to where I came from” in China.) But I cannot support a society that denies people the right to express themselves, and I would much rather live in a society where the freedom of speech is not just a privilege, but a right—even though I may never be seen as a true member of this society. It’s a trade-off, but at least it is one that I have the freedom to make.

To the editor:
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers’s argument that “universities as institutions must avoid acting in a way that suggests that they endorse any one position in a political controversy” is well-taken. When I read that, I initially thought he was preparing to apologize for his speech at morning prayers some 12 and a half years ago, when in his presidential capacity he offered a list of responses to the Israel-Palestine conflict that he deemed anti-Semitic and therefore inappropriate. The list was remarkably elastic, covering everything from neo-Nazis painting swastikas on Jewish memorials to international activists describing large-scale expulsion of Palestinians as “ethnic cleansing” to Harvard faculty signing a divestment petition targeting the occupation.
But no, he stands by that intervention, which is still posted online on the University website, under the “Office of the President” section. What crosses the line into improper endorsement, it seems, is when the “Global Engagement” section of said website hyperlinks to a faculty op-ed that touches on Israel and includes a sentence with which Summers disagrees.
Summers has strong opinions regarding the Middle East, and can be variously persuasive about them. Wholly unpersuasive, however, are his periodic attempts to dress these opinions up as above-the-fray high-mindedness. Academic freedom and institutional neutrality are deeply worthwhile goals. Balancing them can indeed be tricky. But in this case the self-styled champion of both is in fact committed to neither.

It’s no secret that tobacco use is harmful, but despite its widely documented health risks, the decision to use it should be a personal choice. Recently, the Cambridge City Council passed an amendment to the city’s Tobacco Ordinance that raised the age to legally purchase tobacco from 18 to 21 as of June. In an interview with The Crimson, Cambridge City Councilor Marc C. McGovern said that the change “is going to be one of the most significant public health decisions we’ve made.” Councilor McGovern is right that reducing the smoking rate among teenagers is crucial because they are especially susceptible to addiction. But raising the legal tobacco purchase age to 21 is not the most efficient way to accomplish that goal. Rather than an outright ban on tobacco sales to those under 21, raising the state excise tax on tobacco would be a more effective policy for the Commonwealth to pursue in its fight against smoking.
Numerous studies have quantified the effect of higher tobacco prices on smoking in a variety of age groups. While the outright ban that the Cambridge City Council passed only directly targets an age range of three years, an increase of the excise tax on tobacco would reduce smoking across all age groups. A June, 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes would cause smoking rates to decline by 5 percent for 12- to 17-year-olds, 4.5 percent for 18-year-olds, 4 percent for 19- to 39-year-olds, and 1.5 percent for those older than 40.
In short, raising taxes on tobacco products would be a much more powerful solution for Cantabrigians and Bay Staters of all ages. According to CDC data on youth smoking, almost 90 percent of smokers first smoked before the age of 18, and 99 percent tried it by 26. Councillor McGovern told The Crimson that he believes the goal of the city’s new ordinance is to limit smoking by 16- and 17-year-olds, noting that he regularly sees 18-year-olds buying cigarettes for 15-year-olds near the school where he works. Rather than seeking to prevent only the situation McGovern has observed, however, lawmakers could implement a wider solution that will reduce smoking across all age groups. According to a 2014 report from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the average tax per pack of cigarettes in Massachusetts was $4.04—a $3.51 excise tax and an average of $0.53 in sales tax. Increasing the excise tax by 10 percent to $3.86 has the potential to put a real dent in smoking rates across all age groups.
In the nationwide battle against smoking, statewide tax increases on tobacco products are only one piece of the puzzle.  In particular, the Food and Drug Administration should move quickly to revise its graphic warning labels in response to an unfavorable, but not fatal, federal court ruling from last year. Studies have shown that these labels are effective in making smokers consider quitting. Along with higher taxes, such changes have the potential to be much more effective than simply raising the tobacco purchase age. Teenagers have always found ways around age-based restrictions. In order to most effectively reduce smoking rates, efforts must hit smokers where it hurts: their wallets.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It's not very often that I’m confronted with the weight of my own words after they’ve been sent off into the vortex of the Internet. That changed this winter break.
A few days before I arrived back home in California, I went out to dinner with my family. The restaurant we chose that night was crowded, so we had to wait outside with a number of other patrons until our table was ready. While we were waiting, I saw a young couple standing on a nearby corner. The man had his hand gripped around his girlfriend’s arm, and was screaming a number of expletives at her, calling her an “f—ing bitch”, and pressing his face within inches of hers. The girl was in tears. I looked around at the other restaurant patrons, waiting for someone to react, but they ignored the scene. Some looked down at the floor and others continued on with their conversations.
It was the first time I had personally witnessed the bystander effect in action. Momentarily, the phenomenon implicated me too, for I thought that I had perhaps overestimated the severity of the situation based on the responses from fellow patrons. It was then that I considered an article I had written a few months prior, which covered a social experiment from a Swedish group known as STMLM Panda. For the experiment, STMLM Panda hired a man and women to act out a scenario in which a boyfriend verbally and physically abuses his girlfriend in an elevator. The incident was filmed for a YouTube short, which captured the troubling lack of reactions from fellow bystanders. Only one out of 53 “participants” in the experiment stood up for the woman being abused.
Having been critical of the responses in the video, I knew that this incident outside the restaurant was a test of whether or not I could turn my own words into action. As the girlfriend ran into the restaurant crying, I followed after her and asked if she felt safe in her current situation. When her boyfriend saw me talking to her, he screamed at me, warning me to mind my own business, after which I asked him to consider how talking to a woman that way looked to a third party observer. He quickly apologized, and I walked away content in the knowledge that my passion for social justice was more than just idle chatter.
Minutes later, however, I heard the man screaming at his girlfriend again, using the same tone and the same choice words as before. In that moment, I was convinced that I had failed. My actions had been meaningless, and served more to bolster my own ego than affect real change. It was only when I reflected on the incident later on that I realized how naïve I had been—I was performing an action with the expectation that there would be a guaranteed pay-off, when, in reality, being a champion of social justice often means resting on principle alone.
As young people, we tend to be overly idealistic about our impact on the world, particularly when it comes to issues of social justice. We tell ourselves that problems will be fixed if people speak up, but we occasionally fail to consider what happens when our words or actions are insufficient.
Yet, as discouraging as these moments may be, the act of protest, of standing up for what is right, of defending the defenseless, is critical to advancing our society. Many of our own Harvard students seem to have already figured this out. Moving forward, I intend to keep their example in mind and remind myself that activism is a doctrine, not an investment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 10, 2015, at 1:54 p.m.
As many Harvard schools cancel classes Tuesday for the third time in as many weeks—only its fourth snow day since 1978—administrators have begun to consider ways to compensate for lost instructional time.
After the MBTA announced Monday night that it would suspend services for Tuesday, Harvard schools notified affiliates that they would also shut down, citing the difficulty employees would have in commuting to Harvard.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris wrote in an email that to counter for lost time, the College is considering a number of options: scheduling affected classes for Fridays, having students watch video lectures, extending two-hour classes to three hours, and holding make-up classes during reading period when permitted.
“We’re a residential college, and we’re running out of days in the calendar to make up missed classes,” Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde wrote in an email. “By the same token... it’s no longer the case that most faculty and staff live near the University, and many employees are hard pressed to come to work when their children’s schools are closed down.”
As best as Harris can remember, in recent years the school has not had more than one canceled day in a single semester. Harvard has had only seven snow days in the last four decades; before this semester, the only others were in 2013 and 1978. Other recent cancellations due to the manhunt for the alleged Boston Marathon bombers and Hurricane Sandy, both in the 2012-2013 year, occurred in different semesters.
“This is just a year, I think, when we have to recognize that the amount of snow we have on the ground is extraordinary,” Lassonde wrote. “So we need to be flexible and adaptable in our thinking, putting people’s safety before our desire to do our duty.”
The Business School has canceled MBA and doctoral classes, though executive education classes will still take place. Harvard Extension School web conferences will continue, through classes are canceled.
The Graduate School of Design, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, School of Dental Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Harvard Law School, the Graduate School of Education, the Divinity School, the School of Public Health, the Kennedy School of Government, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are all closed Tuesday.
After operating Monday, the Harvard shuttle will try to operate as fully as possible on Tuesday, Director of Harvard Transit and Fleet Management David E. Harris Jr. wrote in an email. According to Lassonde’s College-wide email sent Monday evening, the evening van service would shut down on Tuesday morning at 12:30 a.m. due to road conditions and light ridership.
All make-up exams that were originally scheduled for this week are still postponed until next week. Harvard University Health Services will stay open for urgent care.
Before this week's snowstorm hit, the National Weather Service warned against windy conditions with gusts reaching 35 miles per hour. Though he did not declare a travel ban, Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 announced a statewide snow emergency on Sunday.
“The big issue for us at this point is not just the storm but the cumulative impact of the past two weeks,” Baker said at a press conference Monday. “Many places will now have had somewhere between 70 or 80 inches of snow having fallen in the past 14 days.”
Between 2013 and 2015, Harvard has seen four of its seven snow days in four decades. In 1977, before a snow day in 1978, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III joked that, “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 10, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of snow days that Harvard has had in the last four decades. In fact, it has closed for snow seven days in that time.

Faculty and administrators in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' Arts and Humanities Division are working with the University's Allston planning groups in hopes of securing space across the river for more modern art-making facilities. The Arts and Humanities expansion would come in addition to the planned SEAS relocation, which is slated to move two-thirds of the school’s faculty to Allston in 2019.
Three major affiliates of the division—the American Repertory Theater and the departments of Music and Visual and Environmental Studies—are considering finding spaces in Allston for rehearsals and exhibitions, according to English department chair W. James Simpson. Simpson serves on the Allston Academic Planning Committee, a group of faculty and administrators chaired by Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen wrote in an email that “conversations are ongoing” but “no definitive plans are in place yet.”
“One has the feeling that things are quickening and that things are moving forward,” VES Department Chair Robb Moss said. He added that he thinks the “amount of conversations and urgency in the conversations,” and that fact that “art-making [is] becoming more front and center at Harvard,” indicate that expansion might become a reality.
Though Moss said no locations have yet been determined for potential performance spaces, he said that administrators are considering a building known as the “gateway site” which will be built on the site of old Charlesview apartments for academic purposes, University officials said at a Harvard-Allston Task Force Meeting last October. Harvard’s institutional master plan for Allston originally slated the building for administrative purposes.
Moss said that while the VES department has suitable studio and exhibition spaces in Cambridge, such spaces were designed for art making in the 19th and 20th centuries, and that new locations in Allston may enhance modern-day film screenings and performances.
“This may be an opportunity for Allston to build art-making spaces that could house all kinds of art making,” Moss said. “You could in the same architectural space have a sound studio, practice studio, for performers or dancers or musicians.”
Similarly, the Music Department has long been in need of new rehearsal and performance spaces that suit modern music styles, according to Simpson. Currently, the department’s main performance space is Paine Hall.
“Harvard desperately needs the performing arts center that many of our peer institutions have,” Simpson said. “[Paine Hall]  is suitable for all kinds of music but not the kinds of music that have emerged since 1914,” when it was completed.
The ART, meanwhile, is mostly interested in rehearsal space, Simpson said.
Although very early in conceptualization, rehearsal spaces could be utilized by other Harvard affiliates and the Allston community as well as for ART productions, according to Anna C. Fitzloff, director of marketing and communications at the ART.
The new Harvard Allston Education Portal at 224 Western Ave.—which will host an opening celebration on Feb. 21— will include space for live art performances and exhibitions open to the community, though it is not affiliated with the Arts and Humanities division.
“We want to be a home for all kinds of faculty- and student-directed productions and curations,” the Portal’s new arts coordinator Eva B. Rosenberg ’10 said, noting that she is actively trying to make faculty and students aware of the Portal’s services for art-making and exhibition.

With two additional students declaring their candidacies after the original submission deadline, a total of 17 students will be running for eight open seats in the Undergraduate Council midterm elections, ensuring that no seat will remain vacant.
As of Sunday afternoon, only two students had submitted their declarations, according to UC Elections Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18. Later in the day, the deadline for students to announce their candidacies was extended 12 hours from midnight to Monday at noon.
According to UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, the deadline was extended primarily because all students living in houses with vacancies had not received the UC’s mail merge.
“The mail merge is one of our main forms of communication to the student body, and as you can imagine we did not think it would be fair if some students knew about the opportunity to run while others simply didn't check their spam,” Nasrollahzadeh said.
While all UC representative positions will be filled because of the candidate influx post-deadline, the only competitive elections will be in Lowell and Pforzheimer.
Representatives engaged in email and personal outreach over the weekend to urge their peers to run for seat vacancies in six of the 12 upperclassmen houses.
“[The emails] looked rather desperate,” said Adams House Committee Co-Chair Santiago Pardo ’16, referring to the emails sent by the UC to residents in Adams House. “It got to the point where they were using click-bait on the subject lines.”
Elections will be held from Feb. 10 at noon until Feb. 13 at noon.
The candidates are as follows:
Adams
Tamara S. Fernando ’16
Rohan Pidaparti ’17
Dunster
Samuel C. Becker ’17
Kirkland
Cybele C. Greenberg ’16
Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16
Leverett
Oliver W. Kim ’16

Bowen Lu ’17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Administrative Board required five undergraduates to temporarily withdraw from the College in the 2013-2014 academic year in disciplinary cases related to sexual “social behavior,” the highest number in at least the last five years, according to caseload data released by the College’s chief disciplinary body.
In total, the Ad Board required 39 undergraduates to temporarily withdraw from the College in 2013-2014, according to the statistics, a decrease from 2012-2013, when the Board made 110 students withdraw in the same year that it adjudicated Harvard’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory.
The 2013-2014 statistics are the most recent caseload numbers available on the Ad Board’s website. The data break down the Board’s caseload into broad categories, including academic dishonesty, “social behavior,” and “social behavior - sexual.”
The five withdrawal mandates listed under the sexual behavior subheading last year was a five-year high, up from two cases in 2012-2013.
Of the required withdrawal disciplinary decisions, 23 were related to academic dishonesty, a steep decline from the 97 students who were required to withdraw for cheating in the previous year, roughly 70 of whom were implicated in the Government 1310 cheating case.
The number of students required to withdraw in cases related to “social behavior” numbered 10 last year, a slight increase compared to seven such cases in 2012-2013. Required withdrawals specifically related to “social behavior - drugs,” in contrast, hit a three-year low of zero in 2013-2014.
Overall, the Ad Board issued 233 disciplinary votes last academic year, a number significantly smaller than 2012-2013, when it voted on 355 infractions.
The number of “House warnings” that the Ad Board issued continued a downward trend last year, dropping to 56 warnings from 74 the previous academic year.
In general, the bulk of the Ad Board’s caseload is spent hearing petitions, such as approving requests to activate advanced standing. The Ad Board voted on 1,567 academic petitions in 2013-2014, the highest number in the last five years.
Notably, petitions for simultaneous enrollment more than doubled last academic year. Last fall, however, the Ad Board voted to tighten restrictions on simultaneous enrollment, meaning that number will likely fall in coming years.
Although the Ad Board provides a summary of its five-year caseload and decisions on its website, in 2010 administrators said they would create a more detailed database summarizing cases in an effort to increase the Board’s transparency. The database would include anonymous details of individual decisions in previous years. Despite the initial pledge, however, the Ad Board has yet to release that database, citing delays stemming from concerns over privacy at various times over the past few years.
Interim Secretary of the Ad Board Brett Flehinger could not be reached for comment.
This current academic year marks the last that the Ad Board will hear cheating cases, as the upcoming implementation of the College’s first honor code will establish a new student-faculty body, called the Honor Council, to hear alleged infractions. And already, the Ad Board no longer investigates sexual harassment cases; the University’s central Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution now investigates complaints while the Ad Board hands down sanctions.

Harvard University Dining Services has started serving fish from local vendor Red’s Best in dining halls for lunch on Fridays under a program it calls the “Catch of the Day.”
Starting in late January, Red’s Best began selling 760 pounds of fresh fish to HUDS weekly, depending on what local fishermen caught that week, at a pre-determined rather than market price, according to Crista Martin, HUDS director for marketing and communications.
Under the new program, HUDS will not know what variety of fish it will serve each coming Friday until that week, but offerings will include haddock, pollock, redfish, hake, cod, and flounder, according to Martin.
Each dining hall will receive a recipe based on the fish that it will serve each week and begin preparing the food on Thursdays, according to Ted Smith, a chef at Quincy House. HUDS served pollock on the two most recent Fridays, according to Smith.
Smith said the program aims to ensure that the fish HUDS serves is fresh. In the past, fish like flounder were usually flash frozen, according to Smith. He said feedback so far has been positive.
“I heard from a few people,” Smith said. “They were really excited about this program. The fish was excellent.”
Martin T. Breslin, director for culinary operations at HUDS who brought the program to the dining service, praised the new partnership in an email.
“I am very excited about this relationship, serving local sustainably caught seafood while supporting the local fishermen,” he wrote. “We hope that we could expand the program and have more food from Red’s Best on the menu.”

In a second day off from classes in two weeks, many undergraduates trudged knee-deep through fresh layers of snow while others, unfazed by cancellations that were formerly a rare occurrence, stayed inside and finished coursework. Late Monday evening, many students also celebrated as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced the cancellation of Tuesday classes.
On Sunday, many University schools, including the FAS, the Law School, and the Kennedy School of Government, canceled Monday classes as Boston braced for an expected snowfall almost two feet, adding to the already significant precipitation winter storm “Juno” previously dumped on Cambridge.
Some critical staff worked throughout Sunday night, as they did in previous weeks, to clear the snow.
Huberto Tejada, a crew chief for a custodial subdivision of campus services, said he stayed the night in Adams House, sleeping for a few hours at a time, and then returned back outside to clear the entrances.
“You get used to it,” Tejada said of the weather.
Debbie N. A. Onuoha ’15 seized a shovel as she helped remove new snow from the grounds of Quincy House. The clanging sound of students and staff wielding shovels reverberated throughout the campus Monday afternoon.
For many students, the additional accumulation also provided a unique opportunity to climb steep mounds of snow that snow removal vehicles had piled up in specific areas.
William H. Bloxham ’17 and other members of the Mountaineering Club, for instance, climbed long bands of snow near the Malkin Athletic Center and practiced avalanche search and rescue drills, implanting grey pickets at the top of the frozen peak.
Elsewhere, undergraduates trekked through mostly empty roads, tossed around rugby balls, and tackled one another into the freshly filled-in expanses of trodden snow.
“The snow is really, really fluffy, so it’s great to fall into,” said Ethan Samet-Marram ’15, carrying a beige tray from a location he would not specify.
In the Yard, white snow mostly covered the thighs and ankles of the John Harvard statue, but visitors wiped clean its left golden shoe and some continued to snap photographs undeterred.
Other undergraduates, likewise, returned to the normality of the week, watching television, beginning homework or briefly venturing outside to shovel sidewalks and walkways.
“I’m gonna catch up on work—that’s it,” Catherine R. Myong ’18 said of her plans in the early afternoon.
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde sent an email Monday evening announcing the closure of FAS classes on Tuesday, marking the second instance this semester that scheduled courses for Tuesday will not convene.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 11, 2015 at 1:30 a.m.
A group of students suing the University to divest from fossil fuels is preparing for a hearing on motions by Harvard and the attorney general’s office to dismiss the case. The hearing was scheduled for Tuesday but has been called off due to inclement weather.
In November, seven students formed what they called the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition, representing themselves without a lawyer. The group argued in an 11-page complaint that Harvard’s continued investment of its endowment—valued last month at $35.9 billion—in fossil fuel companies represents “a breach of [Harvard’s] fiduciary and charitable duties as a public charity and nonprofit corporation.” The complaint also alleged that the University has been intentionally investing in “abnormally dangerous activities.”
All the plaintiffs in the case are members of Divest Harvard, a University-wide group founded in 2012 with the mission of encouraging Harvard to divest its holdings from fossil fuel companies. The students are seeking an injunction ordering the University to withdraw its direct and indirect holdings from fossil fuel companies.
In December, Harvard filed a motion for the case to be dismissed. The motion, filed by Martin F. Murphy and Jennifer A. Kirby on behalf of Harvard Management Company—the body responsible for investing the endowment—and the president and fellows of the University, argued that under Massachusetts law “standing to contest a charitable organization's management is the exclusive province of the Attorney General, except in extraordinary circumstances not present here.”
The motion also asserted that investment in fossil fuels is lawful, precluding the attorney general from bringing a case against the University for “misappropriation” of its funds.
“Permitting claims like the Plaintiffs' to proceed would improperly compromise the inherent authority of Harvard and other non-profit entities to manage their own affairs, entangling courts in the myriad internal decisions inherent in running a charitable organization—a result plainly inconsistent with the public interest and well-settled law,” the motion read.
A motion to dismiss the case, filed on behalf of former Attorney General Martha M. Coakley on Dec. 10, argued that the plaintiffs’ “status as Harvard students does not give them standing to assert claims of mismanagement against Harvard fiduciaries.”  The Harvard Climate Justice Coalition responded in early January with a memorandum to the University and also one to Coakley.
Many legal experts have noted the novelty of the case and worried that it may be too narrow. The students suing, though, say that a legal challenge is another tool in their arsenal to put pressure on the University to divest and disagree with the premise that because they are students, they do not have standing to sue.
“[The] Harvard Corporation should not be able to hide behind the fact that we are students who are here for four years,” Harvard Law School student and one of the plaintiffs Joseph E. Hamilton said. “They should still be accountable for their charitable duties.”
Hamilton added that he expects the judge to return a decision on the motion to dismiss within a few months and if the case is dismissed, the Climate Justice Coalition will file an appeal.

Harvard wrestling saw a tough road trip this past weekend (1-7, 0-6 EIWA), as the squad fell to Lehigh as well as Ivy League foes Princeton and Penn. Injuries continue to plague the Crimson as it goes into its last leg of dual-meet season.
“Our guys wrestled hard but we came up on the wrong side of a lot of things,” senior heavyweight David Ng said. “There’s nothing that practice can’t fix as we finish up this year.”
HARVARD 12, PRINCETON 21
Harvard fell short against the Tigers (), losing 21-12. Starting with a forfeit in the 125 weight class, the Crimson was unable to close the deficit and regain the lead.
A highlight for the team came from captain James Fox, who notched a personal win against No. 10 ranked Abram Ayala in a matchup that Fox has seen several times over his collegiate career.
“Those two have met so many times, and [Ayala] really knows how to wear James down and get him tired,” Ng said. But James really stepped up, and kept fighting and got a takedown in the last 20 seconds.”
No. 15 ranked junior captain Todd Preston also contributed a win for the team, as he outmaneuvered Princeton’s 141-pounder, Jordan Laster, 5-0.
“Todd wrestled really hard,” Ng said. “He beat a pretty tough guy at home, and that really got our bench and crowd really excited, and got a lot of energy going for us.”
The last two wins on the day came from Ng and rookie Josef Johnson. Ng picked up a decision over the Tigers’ Ray O’Donnell in the heavyweight division, while newcomer Johnson continued his strong season performance with a tight win over Judd Zeigler, 7-6.
For three Harvard wrestlers—Devon Gobbo, Patrick Hogan, and Josh Popple—this was their first weekend back from injury after a few weeks off the mat.
“Its tough, we’ve had those three guys come back from injuries, so we knew it was going to be difficult for them, getting right back in it,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “But it was good for them to get in matches.”
HARVARD 13, PENN 26
The same day, Harvard continued with a match against Ivy League foe Penn (6-4, 2-1), and repeated last years performance in the Crimson’s second consecutive loss.
“Obviously we aren’t pleased with results,” Weiss said. “We just need to compete harder. That’s all it comes down to. We wrestled better against Penn, but having to give it up at 125 pounds certainly doesn’t help the cause. We need to take our training into competition.”
In the matchup against their respective Quaker opponents, Fox, Preston, and Ng repeated their winning performances, while junior Devon Gobbo contributed a win of his own.
The most notable performance came from Fox, who earned a decision against the Penn’s Canaan Bethea, in a hard fought match that went to three overtime periods.
“He had already shown toughness against Princeton, and he just showed that grit again against Penn,” Ng said. “Going into triple overtime and being able to pull out a win like that is huge.”
HARVARD 3, LEHIGH 36
The Crimson headed to Lehigh (11-4, 7-1) on Sunday, rounding out the weekend with a third away match.
Preston put Harvard on the scoreboard with a hard fought victory over No. 20 Randy Cruz, taking the win 2-0.
“Preston had the match in control, and I think he made a mistake that caught him,” Weiss said. “He’s doing well and he did a good job this weekend but he knows that he’s not where he needs to be for the end of the year. But he has some time to figure that out.”
Harvard would not score again for the rest of the contest.
“I think that we have a young team right now,” Ng said. “We have a lot of injuries and starters who aren’t in the lineup, so we have a lot of freshman and sophomores who going out that aren’t used to being in that starting position. Its tough for them because they’re fighting as hard as they can, but it just takes time and experience.”

The No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team (8-2, 7-0 Ivy) competed against two Ivy League rivals this weekend in the final conference games to determine the Ivy League championship title.
After losing two matches early in this season, the perfect squash season from 2013-14 seemed to lose its significance. However, since then, the Crimson has won eight consecutive contests.
“I think it was actually the two losses that kick-started the season for us,” sophomore Devon McLaughlin said. “We didn’t lose a single match last year, and I think we went in a little overconfident. Once we lost those, we had a meeting about it, and everyone needed to be more prepared and focus more. After J-term, everyone kind of came together as a team and feeling a lot stronger.”
Last weekend, Harvard defeated Columbia in an upset that placed the Crimson in a promising position to claim the Ivy title. This weekend, Harvard toppled the team favored for the title, in order to claim the 40th Ivy championship title.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
Brown (5-8, 0-7) does not have the lineup strength of the Crimson, as its record registers no conference wins up to this point in the season. This was shown this weekend when Harvard swept eight of its nine matches in three games. The Bears won just one game in one match during the entire contest.
In the third seed, freshman Bradley Smith gave up one game to his opponent Thomas Blecher, before winning the match, 3-1. After three consecutive losses this season, classmate Madhav Dhingra won, 3-0, against his opponent in the number one spot Sunday.
“I also think what made the biggest difference was our freshmen,” coach Michael Way said. “There is quite a degree of maturity that you don’t always see, and I think that our freshmen have stepped up wonderfully.”
Co-captains Tyler Olson and Sachin Patel notched wins, with Olson continuing his perfect record with a ninth victory, and Patel playing his first match of the season.
“Tyler has improved a lot over this season,” Way said. “He’s not the same player he was last year, and he was very good last year. The version of himself now would beat the version of Tyler last season, 3-0. He’s just playing really good, solid, basic, squash. He’s doing fantastically well, especially as a captain.”
HARVARD 7, YALE 2
At the Murr Athletic Center on Friday night, the Crimson took on No. 5 Yale (10-4, 5-2) in a game that determined who would claim at least a share of the Ivy League title.
In an unofficial earlier match against Yale during Ivy Scrimmages, the Bulldogs defeated Harvard, 6-3. However, Yale was only able to hold onto two of its six original victories in this Friday’s contest. Sophomore Dylan Murray won a hard-fought match in five after dropping two games. Classmate Bryan Koh also won a close game, 3-2, against newcomer Edward Columbia. Both Murray and Koh redeemed previous losses to their Yale opponents during Ivy Scrimmages.
“There was a little bit of tension because of the loss [against Yale] early in the season, but we knew we just had to go in and play our game,” McLaughlin said. “It was at home, which was an advantage, and everyone went out there deliberately and professionally and just did their best, and we had a really good day.”
The only two Crimson losses came from the number one spot, where Dhingra lost in three games to junior Sam Fenwick while junior Matt Roberts also lost, 3-0, as the seventh seed.At the bottom of the ladder, Olson and freshman Seif Eleinen tallied two more wins against the Bulldogs, both of which were five-game matches. The three other Harvard players dominated their opponents in three games in order to clinch a share of the title.
“On paper we were not the favorites,” Way said. “We had two teams that were stronger than us, and so there was nothing straightforward about this win whatsoever. I think for the guys to win the Ivy title for such a young team and so many guys graduating last year that it’s such an achievement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past week, senior wing Wesley Saunders helped the Harvard men’s basketball team earn a share of first place in the Ivy League standings, following two conference victories on the road against Brown and Yale. Saunders netted a career-high 33 points in the overtime triumph in Providence and added another 16 versus the Bulldogs, securing his spot as Athlete of the Week.
While the senior dominated on the court, several other Crimson athletes contributed particularly noteworthy performances this week:
Nikki Okwelogu, Women’s Track and Field
At the team’s annual Crimson Elite Meet this past weekend, Harvard sophomore Nikki Okwelogu was the best shot putter in the building. Period. Not only did Okwelogu shatter the Ivy League women’s shot put record with a distance of 16.39 meters on her longest throw, but she also out-tossed any of the male competitors at this weekend’s meet. The Fresno, Calif. native just edged out the men’s champion, senior Ethan Knight of Boston University, whose best throw of the day measured 16.37 meters.
Okwelogu, who also competes for the Nigerian world track and field team, won the event by almost three meters, defeating second-place finisher Samantha Turner of Jacksonville University. The sophomore’s historic throw came on her third attempt of six, after a toss of 15.69m on her first attempt and a foul on the second.
The reigning Ivy League indoor champion will look to continue her winning ways next weekend at the H-Y-P indoor meet as well as the Ivy League Championships on Feb. 28.
Steve Michalek, Men’s Hockey
Despite dropping six of its last seven games, most recently a road loss to Brown on Saturday, the Harvard men’s hockey maintained at least one bright spot in senior goaltender Steve Michalek. The netminder’s heroic efforts for the Crimson last week included a school-record 63 saves in Tuesday’s double-overtime heartbreaker, a 4-3 loss in the Beanpot semifinal to Boston University.
Despite a previous overtime win over then No. 1/1 BU on Nov. 25, the Crimson blew a 3-1 lead late in the second period, giving up two goals in the last five minutes of play. Nevertheless, Michalek fought back to fend off the 34 shots he faced in the third period and first overtime. Just over two minutes into the second overtime period, Michalek’s career night ended with a BU goal from junior Danny O’Regan. The goaltender’s 63 saves on the evening were more than enough to break the previous Beanpot record of 52 saves, which stood for 45 years. Michalek has now posted three consecutive games with a save percentage north of 90.
Erin McDonnell, Women’s Basketball
Co-captain forward Erin McDonnell lit up visiting Yale by going six-for-ten from behind the three-point line and posting 18 points and eight rebounds in a winning effort on Saturday night. She also added two blocks and a pair of assists to cap off a 65-55 Harvard victory. The senior’s six makes from behind the arc were a career-high
McDonnell helped ice the game for the Crimson in the second half by ending a 7-0 Bulldog run which cut the Harvard lead to two by knocking home a three-pointer with six-and-a-half minutes left to play. Two minutes later, the forward hit her final shot of the game, another three-pointer, to stretch the Crimson lead to 12.
McDonnell’s efforts helped her team snap Yale’s five game conference win streak, dealing the Bulldogs their first conference loss of the year. The win moved the Crimson to 9-11 on the season and 2-4 in Ivy League play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All year, senior wing Wesley Saunders has borne the brunt of the expectations that have been placed on the Harvard men’s basketball team (15-5, 5-1 Ivy).
Before the season, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said Saunders had a chance to become the best player to ever go through the program.
Through the season’s first eight games, he was garnering attention as a fringe National Player of the Year candidate; averaging over 20 points on 55 percent shooting, he was Harvard’s offensive fulcrum and the team’s defensive anchor.
And yet, the focus was all on the shot he didn’t make—a game-winning attempt against Holy Cross where the ball, and his team, came up just short.
He struggled coming back after finals, not making a shot in the team’s 49-point loss to Virginia. It was the first time in 74 games he hadn’t made a field goal. He had more than 15 in five of his first seven games; it took him two months and 11 games to do it again. He hit as many threes in his two games before the break than he did in the seven after. In the Crimson’s league home opener—a 70-61 loss to Dartmouth—Saunders had six turnovers and missed half of his foul shots.
When his team needed him most, however, Saunders stepped up. The next game, at Princeton, students sarcastically rained down chants of “Jordan” as he calmly put up 14 points, eight assists, and seven rebounds in just 31 minutes—clinching the game with a flurry of steals and late free throws.
This weekend, he made good on the moniker, averaging 24.5 points in a pair of two-point wins that catapulted Harvard atop the Ivy League standings.
Against Brown, he put in 33 points—the highest ever for an Amaker player—and hit the game-tying shot as the buzzer sounded in regulation, fighting through traffic to catch his own miss and lay the ball in.
“Obviously the difference for us [tonight] was Wesley Saunders,” Amaker said Friday. “He played inspired basketball to get the ball to the basket.”
It was not the first time the senior had been called upon to perform late-game heroics. Against UMass his three-point play with 38 seconds to go gave the Crimson a lead it would never relinquish. A week later, he had 25 points, six rebounds, and seven steals in a double overtime victory against Vermont. If the Brown win was an escape, the victory over Yale the following night was a triumph. The Elis had jumped out to a 5-0 start to the season on the play of junior forward Justin Sears, who had taken over Saunders’ mantle as the frontrunner for Ivy League Player of the Year. Their coach, James Jones, said before the season of Sears: “It’s hard to make an argument that he is not the best player in the league.” But Saunders and Harvard quieted Yale with a 52-50 win, ascending to a tie for first. Saunders led all players with 16 points, chipping in five points and three assists for good measure. Sears had nine points and seven rebounds.
Although Saunders was the fulcrum of the Crimson offense, scoring or assisting on 42 percent of his team’s points, Sears—who posted just a 19 percent usage rate—rarely touched the ball down the stretch.
Afterwards, Saunders downplayed the significance of the contest. The senior—who scarcely knows what it’s like to lose an Ivy League road game, having won 12 straight and 23 of 26 in his career—noted that there is still a lot of basketball still to be played.
“We were aware of our standing in the league obviously coming into the night, but we approached it as if it were just another game,” Saunders said Saturday. “I think that everyone came out and showed that they were ready to fight, and I think we left it all out on the floor.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Hopping back and forth on the right side of the strip, Harvard junior foil fencer Jerry Chang waited patiently for his Princeton opponent to make his move.
After 20 seconds of waiting, Chang caught his opponent mid-lunge with an attack of his own, clinching the final point for the Crimson in a thrilling 14-13 win over Princeton and giving Harvard men’s team (11-3, 4-1 Ivy) a share of the Ivy League title.
Coming off a tough showing at the St. John’s invitational, the No. 4 Crimson women (11-5-1, 4-2) bounced back with a 4-2 showing, which was good enough for a three-way tie with Penn and the Tigers.
Sophomore sabré fencer Adrienne Jarocki continued her Ivy dominance with a pristine 18-0 bout record, while épéeist Isabel DiTella finished 15-3 to carry the team.
MEN’S FENCING
For the second time in the past three seasons, the fencing deities chose Chang to represent Harvard in the final match of the Ivy League Championship. And both times, the Mountain View, Calif., native has come through in the clutch with the final touch.
“Jerry is a very strong fencer in high pressure situations, and that’s not the first time he’s been in that spot,” said sophomore épéeist Alexander Eldeib, who was one of the first of Chang’s teammates to mob him immediately following the final touch. “We only won the Ivy title outright [in 2013] after he won the final bout against his brother at Penn.”
The situation was not the only aspect that was the same as two seasons ago, with the total bout score tied 13-13 on the final day of the championships. In this year’s edition as well, Chang began the final action with a beat-attack and finished with his arms in the air in celebration.
Though the final moment may have been Chang’s time to shine, it was a Harvard rookie who stole the show. Freshman Eli Dershwitz, who entered the weekend of Ivy competition with a 23-4 collegiate record, finished 15-0 to help lift the Crimson to its third straight year of at least a share of the Ivy crown.
“It was an incredible performance,” Eldeib said. “I think Eli really puts in a lot of time outside of practice…. He’s really good at going that extra mile and [at] getting that extra practice in.”
Eldeib had a noteworthy weekend of his own, finishing 11-4 in the épée division after a 10-5 appearance last season at his first career Ivy Round Robins. Rounding out the group of strong performances all around, junior co-captain Duncan O’Brien finished 10-5 with his sabré.
Coming into the final round of matchups, Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, and Penn were tied at 3-1. When the dust settled, the victorious Lions and Crimson came away with a share of the title for a second straight year with 4-1 records.
WOMEN’S FENCING
Led by Jarocki, the Crimson climbed its way towards the top of the leaderboard, but came up short in the win column, finishing second for the second-straight year. For a second consecutive season, Jarocki finished with a perfect 18-0 bout record against her Ivy competition, securing a guaranteed All-Ivy selection.
“I came into the weekend with the same mentality as last year looking for the same result,” Jarocki said.
The 2014 NCAA Individual champion and her sabré teammates cruised past the competition across the board, with Jarocki and co-captains Aliya Itzkowitz and Kara Lee finishing a combined 41-13 in the five matches over the weekend.
“Fencing alongside [Jarocki] brings up everyone’s level,” said sophomore foilist Liana Yamin, who finished 6-8 for the competition. “With her hard work and her talent, she’s completely deserving of [the recognition], and with the team, she always helps us to rally to win.”
Harvard employed a four-person rotating foil team in an attempt to match individual strengths with opponent weaknesses. The results were mixed, with Yamin, fellow sophomore Hali Nelson, and freshmen Hellary Zhang and MacKenzie Lawrence finishing a combined 29-25.

You’ll probably learn a variety of important skills during your time at Harvard– how to flirt with your future i-banking husband at a PC party (does that even exist?), finding a cure for every disease while simultaneously achieving world peace, and memorizing Einstein’s formula for general relativity (tbh, we just searched “really hard formulas” on the internet for this) without using a calculator. We’re going to break it you really quickly and bluntly though: the undergrad experience isn’t about saving the world or coppin’ that A in orgo (good job though if you did). Here’s what you’ll actually learn at the big H:
1) How to get into a final clubWe’re about to get all double entrende with this one– we mean how to get into one of Harvard’s exclusive social clubs and also how to physically get past the door for a PSK party. Both processes involve a bit of schmoozing, whether you’re trying to sell your best qualities in a non-bragging but “I swear I’m cool” way or you’re sweet-talking that sophomore punch (or middle-aged man) at the door. Clothing is also very important– we’d suggest dressing to the nines for punch and hearing out Project X’s good ol’ motto of “wearing something tight” for getting into the parties.
2) Becoming BFFs with RubinoffUnless you grew up in the ‘burbs of Boston (like yours truly, Noshoes), you probably thought Rubinoff (Ruby for Noshoes’ Beantown friends) was a knock-off cough syrup before coming to Harvard. Well, it’s kind of like cough syrup because they both taste terrible, but the difference is that Rubinoff tastes worse. But if you’re on that low college budget, Rubinoff will literally become that college friend that your parents warned you about: fun at the time, but hard to appreciate (or remember) in the long run. Nonetheless, it’s multifunctional:
3) Finding an easy way out of every assignmentDon’t bust us, Dean Hammonds, we’re not advocating any cheating scandals here. But we all know that you lost any semblance of your productivity as soon as you finished giving that valedictorian speech at your high school graduation. There’s nothing like finding that kid in your class who actually enjoys doing p-sets and snagging his/her digits for the blossoming of a new friendship, or turning the task of doing 50 pages of reading for a section into finding one impressive sentence from all your articles to share for “section participation points.” And if any teacher thinks we’re about to read an entire novel on a Thursday night, they better believe that Sparknotes will forever be bae. But if all else fails, at least we have grade inflation, right?
4) How to get free foodNo one likes HUDS, it’s a fact of life. So as the saying goes, desperate times call for desperate measures. And by desperate measures, we mean feigning interest in the Harvard Club of People Who Want to Put a Good Club on their Resume so They Will Save Every Polar Bear in Antarctica (also known as HCPWWPGCRTWSEPBA for easier memorization) in exchange for Domino’s pizza. If HCPWWPGCRTWSEPBA isn’t right for you, we suggest swinging by a freshman entryway study break, go Stein Club hopping, or stacking a month’s worth of the beloved Marshmallow Matey’s into your free IOP Open House drawstring bag at Brain Break.

Are you kidding me?! Two snow days in a ROW? Take the time out of your wide open schedules to thank the weather gods for giving us an unexpected four-day weekend to prep us for our upcoming three-day weekend! At this point, the university might as well just shut down the school and let the students frolick, have snowball fights, sled down Widener Steps, and build snowmen to their heart’s content. Do you even remember where you put your homework, or have you just been using your hundred-dollar textbooks as rudimentary sleds? Good thing we didn’t come to college to learn!
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today there might be some snow floating around, although the bulk of it will probably be on the streets, preventing you from getting to your classes -- an absolute tragedy. And with highs of 32 degrees and lows of 16 degrees, the cold is not so crippling that you can’t spend an hour or two frolicking in the snow!

ON FLYBY
1) Bean Boots Blues: Flyby is disappointed in all of you. Get a little more creative with your choice of winter footwear, please.
2) What You Actually Learn at Harvard: Spoiler alert -- it doesn’t include anything you “learn” in your classes.
IN THE NEWS
1) MBTA Rail Services Suspended for Tuesday: “In the face of yet another New England snowstorm, the MBTA suspended all rail services at 7 p.m. Monday, and they will remain closed Tuesday.”
2) Attendance Doubles in ‘WECode’ Second Year: “Students from over 40 schools across the country gathered at Maxwell Dworkin and Northwest Labs this past weekend to listen to female professionals and attend workshops by technology companies such as Google and Microsoft at the second annual WECode conference.”  
3) SEAS Refines Plans for Move to Allston: “Administrators and planning committees at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are continuing to outline broad goals for the eventual relocation of their school to Allston, determined to make a campus that attracts students from across the University, according to interim SEAS Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68.”
EVENTS
The Harvard Political Union is hosting a debate between Conservative and Libertarian members of the Harvard Republican Club to discuss the GOP's future at 7 PM in Science Center D.
Starting today and continuing for the next 3 days is the Harvard February Blood Drive. Sign up to donate blood, and/or sign up to volunteer at the drive at Northwest Labs!
Many other events that were scheduled for today, such as the OCS Design Pathways event, have been cancelled or postponed! Enjoy your snow day!

If you’re anything like us, the emails/posters/Facebook posts about DataMatch made it sound like the answer to all of your prayers. No need to deal with actual messy social interaction when a highly sophisticated algorithm could find your on-campus soulmate for you! But you know what they say: if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. How could questions about our (nonexistent) sex lives described as diseases and World Cup teams indicate which of the 6000 other students at Harvard is the person of our dreams?
We at Flyby would like to offer an equally scientific survey to help you find a Valentine. Just send your answers to us and we’ll be in touch. ;)
1. What website do you frequent the most?
a, Facebook: Living vicariously through your friends who go to state schools
b. YouTube: Enjoying some nice videos
c. RedTube: Enjoying some naughty videos
d. Harvard Gmail: Frantically pubbing emails to all your listservs, you overzealous Haardvark
e. MySpace: Literally who are you
2. Who is your ideal Harry Potter SO?
a. Neville Longbottom: That nerdy middle school loser who transformed overnight into an unattainable hunk you pine for every night
b. Ginny Weasley: Fierce, independent, and much better over text than in real life (Book Ginny vs Movie Ginny)
c. Albus Dumbledore: Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever all the time, but you still love him anyway for some unfathomable reason
d. Luna Lovegood: She’s been sipping some of that Gurdyroot infusion, if you know what I mean ;)
e. Peter Pettigrew: So adorable you’ll want to keep him as a pet and even sleep with him (in more ways than one) at night, until you wake up the next morning completely sober and realize he’s a traitor who sold your parents to Voldemort
3. Which restaurant would you side with in the ultimate burrito showdown of Harvard Square?
a. Qdoba: Convenience over quality is probably your life motto
b. Chipotle: You know it’s worth the walk for your one true love
c. Felipe’s: The new location is pretty romantic
d. Boloco: You’re clearly insane
e. 24 Hour Market: Don’t you know that a wrap isn’t the same thing as a burrito?

We’ve all already had all of yesterday to procrastinate on our work by venturing outside or sleeping, and so today is a day to be productive -- that is, to catch up (or start) some shows that will allow you to remain within the confines of your room guilt-free. Here are some of Flyby’s picks of shows available now on Netflix:
Chuck
The best advice about this show is to just watch it, because the summaries and synopses never do it justice. It’s a comedy and an action-show that follows Chuck Bartowski, a computer geek who works at the Buy More and becomes a secret agent after downloading all of the government’s secrets into his head. A bit unrealistic, perhaps, but the characters are endearing. As Chuck costar Joshua Gomez has explained, “At the end of the day, you come home and there’s plenty of good television, but most of it, I feel like, is a bit of a downer. Chuck is not. It’s the opposite. At the end of a Chuck episode you feel good. It’s fun. You laugh. You go for a fun car chase and you hang out with people you like.” It’s a 10/10 every time.
The Mindy Project
Mindy Kaling spoke at the Law School graduation last year and went to high school in Cambridge. But besides the connections to Harvard, the show has some truly relatable moments, especially around the February 14th time of the year. It’s funny and charming, and the twenty-minute episodes make it a breeze to watch. As Mindy says in season one, “Maybe I won’t get married, ya know? Maybe I’ll do one of those Eat, Pray, Love things. I don’t wanna pray, forget it. I’ll just die alone.”
House of Cards
Everyone and their mom has seen this show, so if you haven’t jumped on the bandwagon yet, it’s probably about time you do so. The third season drops on Netflix on February 27th, and you’ve got the perfect amount of time to catch up on the drama, and the dining hall conversations. Even the Clintons binge-watched this show, with Hillary explaining, “my favorite character is Claire. What a bright, straight shooter that woman is.” Has she seen the second season?
Gilmore Girls
As Amit Das ‘18 explains, “it’s like class warfare and romantic comedy rolled into one burrito.” Although we’re not sure what he means, Gilmore Girls is a show for all genders and all types, and with seven seasons, you’ll be busy for more than just a day.
Ivy
You know you’ve always wanted to watch it! Based on the realistic lives of five roommates in their sophomore year, the show seeks to question: “what am I doing here, what should I be doing here, and what will I be doing after?” It’s an enthralling way to reflect on your own life and its (lack of) meaning, all based at the school you love most. Check this article for a review of the first episode, and then dive right in!
