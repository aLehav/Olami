After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the 2011-12 season, expectations were set pretty low for the Harvard men’s hockey team. The once-proud program appeared destined for another lackluster season, and voters in the ECAC Hockey Preseason Media Poll picked the Crimson to finish dead last in the conference.
But five months later, after a third-place finish in the league, a first-round bye, and a dramatic victory over Yale in the best-of-three ECAC quarterfinals series, the No. 19 Crimson sits in the semifinals of the ECAC Hockey Championships, two wins away from claiming a conference title for the first time since 2004.
“It was no question that it was a chip on our shoulder for where we got picked,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We knew we had talent in the locker room, and we tried to prove it all season to everybody.”
With a national ranking in hand for the first time in over three years, Harvard will try to continue its unexpected run in the semis when it takes on bitter conference rival No. 13 Cornell on Friday night at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, N.J.
The Crimson (12-9-11, 8-5-9 ECAC) did not fare well in the 2011-12 regular season matchups with the Big Red (17-7-7, 12-4-6). After falling to Cornell, 4-2, on Nov. 11 at home, the Crimson managed a 2-2 tie amidst the dead fish in Ithaca, N.Y. on Jan. 21.
“[Playing Cornell] really adds to the excitement,” junior forward Alex Fallstrom said. “We haven’t had that much success against them this year, but I think this will be a great opportunity to get back at them.”
The teams took quite different routes to the semis. The second-place Big Red rolled past Dartmouth unscathed in its quarterfinals series, sweeping the Big Green with 4-3 and 3-1 victories. On the other hand, Yale gave Harvard all it could handle in the quarters, as the Bulldogs took game one before the Crimson staved off elimination by winning games two and three.
But there will be no series comeback for either squad this time around in Friday’s win-or-go-home contest.
The matchup looks poised to become a battle of the goaltenders, as the game pits two of the ECAC’s top netminders against one another.
Between the pipes the Big Red starts sophomore Andy Iles, who, in addition to earning a 0.920 save percentage, held league opponents scoreless for 286 consecutive minutes to set a conference record. For his play, the sophomore is one of three finalists for the league’s goaltender of the year award.
“He’s been very consistent…but also played well in big games,” Cornell coach Mike Schafer said of Iles. “Right now, we’re looking at him in his practice habits, and he’s on top of his game…and you need that in your goaltender.”
Iles forms the backstop of a vaunted Big Red defense, which held league opponents to 2.07 goals per game, second-best in the ECAC.
But the Crimson counters with a high-level goaltender of its own. After rookie goaltender Steve Michalek minded the net for most of the season, Donato replaced the freshman with sophomore goalie Raphael Girard. In his 665 minutes in net—far less than Michalek’s 1336—Girard has saved 93.2 percent of shots, the second-best mark in the conference.
And Girard seems to be peaking at the right time. Perhaps the best performance of the sophomore’s young career came last weekend against Yale, when he stopped 129 of the 136 shots he faced.
“Friday night [against Yale], there were times when he kept us in the game to get it into overtime,” Donato said. “Raphael was outstanding over the weekend, and I think it’s given our team a lot of confidence going forward.”
On the offensive side, the Big Red does not have the individual threats that the Crimson does in senior forward Alex Killorn, who tallied his 50th career goal and 100th career point against Yale, and junior defenseman Danny Biega, one of two finalists for the ECAC Hockey Player of the Year.
The top point scorer for Cornell is Greg Miller, 24th in the conference with 29 points, behind Killorn (42), Biega (34), junior forward Marshall Everson (29), and freshman defenseman Patrick McNally (29). Those four Crimson skaters, along with Fallstrom, helped Harvard convert on its power play 28.4 percent of the time, the second-best mark in the nation.
But the Big Red still averages 2.97 goals per game, just behind the Crimson’s 3.09 mark, through a balanced offense. In Cornell’s two games against Harvard this season, five different Big Red players scored.
“We know they’re more good as a collective team [than through individual standouts],” Fallstrom said. “I feel like they have four strong lines, and they can all generate offense.”
Against the Big Red’s deep attack, coupled with its highly touted defense, the Crimson will have its hands full on Friday night.
“Whenever you play a Mike Schafer-coached Cornell team, you know you’re going to get a team with great discipline, great attention to detail, outstanding goaltending, and I don’t think that’s different this year,” Donato said. “We’re excited about the opportunity, but we know we’re going to have to elevate our game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most students took the first few days of spring break to unwind from the first half of the second semester, the Harvard men’s volleyball team was hard at work on the West Coast. The Crimson utilized a balanced offensive game and strong passing to finish its California road trip with two wins and one loss.
HARVARD 3, CAL BAPTIST 2
After falling to Pepperdine and topping No. 12 Cal State Northridge, the Crimson took on Cal Baptist (10-14, 0-0) to wrap up the weekend. This final game would make or break the squad’s trip to the Golden State.
Harvard did not get off to a good start, dropping the first set, 25-21. The Crimson responded to the pressure by winning a hard-fought second set, in which the game was tied seventeen times, by a score of 25-20. After Harvard took the third set, 25-22, the Lancers answered with a 25-20 win of their own in the fourth to set up a winner-take-all fifth set.
Cal Baptist entered this period on a hot streak, jumping to an early 4-1 lead. Harvard responded with a run of its own, bringing the score to 6-5.  The teams traded the lead until Harvard broke away to end the match, 15-9. Sophomore opposite hitter Nick Madden led the Crimson with a match and career-high 27 kills. He supplemented his numbers with strong defensive play, recording a team-high 10 digs.
With the win, Harvard swept the season series with Cal Baptist, whom the Crimson beat, 3-1, in the Malkin Athletic Center on Feb. 8.
No. 8 PEPPERDINE 3, HARVARD 1
Having extended its winning streak, Harvard traveled to Malibu, Calif. on Mar. 12 to face No. 8 Pepperdine (11-9, 7-8 MPSF). The Waves captured the first two sets, 25-18 and 25-15.  The storyline appeared to be a reversal of the Cal State Northridge game when Harvard rallied to take the third set, 25-22. Although the visiting team found itself down one late in the fourth set, it was too little too late.  Pepperdine closed the match with a 9-1 run, winning 25-17.
“Pepperdine is a really tough team and historically they are quite good,” said sophomore outside hitter Chris Gibbons. “They have a lot of big guys who are tough to stop. I think where we lost the game is that they were a little stronger offensively than we were that day.”
While the team is happy with its overall performance, Jones believes that there are important lessons to be learned from the loss to Pepperdine.
“Pepperdine is a very strong team, but we are a little disappointed on how we started the match,” Jones said. “We let them go on an early run and we let them set the tone for the match…. The Pepperdine game is a reminder that when we face big jump servers, like Penn State, we need to keep them off service runs.  Our digging has gotten better over the course of the season, but our blocking can still improve."
HARVARD 3, No. 12 CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 1
Harvard (13-3, 3-2 EIVA) began its Golden State road trip with a tough game against Cal State Northridge (8-12. 4-9 MPSF).  Ranked 12th in the nation, the Matadors posed a huge threat to the Crimson’s five-game winning streak.
Undaunted by its opponent’s high ranking, Harvard took the first two sets, 25-17 and 25-20. Cal State Northridge did not fall easily, though.  The Matadors avoided being swept on their home court by winning a close third set, 25-22.
The home team carried that momentum into the fourth set, keeping the score close with an early 5-5 tie. Thanks to its strong offensive game, the Crimson was able to outlast its opponent and take the fourth and final set, 25-22. Harvard recorded a .364 hitting percentage for the day. Senior co-captain and outside hitter Matt Jones led the squad with a match-high 16 kills. The win marked the Crimson’s first win over a MPSF opponent in program history.
“I think [this trip] was a definite confidence boost for our team,” Gibbons said. “[We need confidence] playing teams like Northridge, who was ranked No. 12 when we came and beat them. So it speaks a lot to our team and the rest of the volleyball world that we can play with the best of them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team is heading to Atlantic City for  Friday’s ECAC hockey championship semifinals. The trip to New Jersey  comes after an exciting 8-2 win over Yale on Sunday at Bright Hockey  Center. After losing the first game of the series to the Bulldogs, the  Crimson bounced back with two straight wins to advance to the next  round.
For Friday’s match-up, the Crimson will take on its ECAC rival,  number two-seeded Cornell. With one regular-season loss to the Big Red  and one tie, Harvard is looking for its first win of this season over  Cornell.
In addition to experiencing the excitement of the Harvard-Cornell  hockey rivalry, Crimson fans can take advantage of Atlantic City’s many  offerings. While Atlantic City is certainly known for its casinos, here  are some lesser-known Atlantic City draws:
1. Salt water taffy
Salt water taffy has long been a traditional Atlantic City souvenir.   The candy was first created and popularized on the Boardwalk, and is  still sold there today.
2. Monopoly
We have all coveted the lucrative “boardwalk” property in a game of  Monopoly.  But, not all Monopoly players know that the classic Hasbro  game was inspired by Atlantic City.  Many of the properties and  utilities are named after original Atlantic City institutions.
3. Boardwalk Empire
Atlantic City has been recently featured on the small screen, serving as the location for HBO’s Boardwalk Empire.  The show, starring Steve Buscemi, takes place during the 1920s Prohibition era.  While Boardwalk Empire is mostly filmed in New York City, the show uses many special effects to recreate the old Atlantic City feel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.—Though the men’s team fell in its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1946, all was not amiss in the world of Harvard basketball Thursday night.
Thanks to early lights-out shooting and late lockdown defense from co-captain Brogan Berry, the Crimson women’s basketball team earned the Ivy League’s first-ever victory in a women’s NIT game with a 73-71 defeat of Hofstra at the Mack Sports Complex. The Crimson moves on to play Temple in the second round on Saturday.
Berry started the game on fire, going seven for seven from the field—including four for four from long distance—en route to 19 points in the game’s first 15 minutes to help  Harvard build a double-digit first-half lead.
“I hit the zone as a player, and my teammates got me some wide-open shots,” said Berry, who tied a season high with 26. “I just shot when I was open, took it hard when I could, and tried to do whatever I could to keep this team above water in the first half.”
The Crimson maintained its advantage the remainder of the contest, going up by 13 at 63-50 on junior Victoria Lippert’s jumper with 8:51 to go. But from there, the Pride went on an 18-6 run to cut the deficit to one on a Katelyn Loper three with 1:26 left.
Lippert missed a three at the other end, but sophomore Christine Clark was there for an offensive rebound and put-back layup to give Harvard a 71-68 lead.
With a chance to tie with 43 seconds remaining, Hofstra’s Nicole Capurso spotted up for what looked like an open three. But Berry, the senior, was there to swat it away. The block was her first of the season and just the sixth of her career, but it could not have come at a more timely moment.
“It was more of an instinctual play,” Berry said. “I wasn’t really going for the block, I was just trying not to foul her.... But I don’t get very many [blocks], so it was a great feeling.”
Following the rejection, the Crimson got the ball to its co-captain, who swished two free throws to all but ice the game with 24 seconds remaining.
Loper hit a transition three at the other end with 8.2 seconds left, and after Clark missed the front end of a one-and-one, the Pride had a chance to tie. But Hofstra’s Candace Bond drove the lane and airballed a shot at the buzzer in traffic, giving the Crimson the Ancient Eight’s first-ever WNIT win.
“We’re [also] the only Ivy team that’s ever won a game in the NCAA, so this is another piece of great history for the program,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
Berry had just seven points in the second half after an electric first.
Her four threes gave the Crimson a 16-9 lead midway through the opening period. After Hofstra got within four at 22-18, junior Elle Hagedorn had a steal and transition layup and Berry had a short pull-up jumper and an acrobatic and-one off the glass to push the Crimson lead back to 10.
A Capurso three later made it 33-30 with three minutes remaining in the half, but Clark answered with a left-corner long ball, two free throws, and a jumper before Hofstra’s Shante Evans hit two free throws to make it 42-30 going into the break.
“Christine’s a phenomenal scorer for us,” Berry said. “She always hits big shots.... We’re starting to play really well with each other.”
The Pride started the second on a 10-2 run, but once again, the Crimson had an answer. Clark hit a layup off an inbounds, junior Miriam Rutzen found classmate Emma Golen with a pretty backdoor pass, and Clark hit an NBA-range three from the top of the key to extend the Crimson lead back to 12.
A Lippert long ball made it 63-50 with nine minutes to go before Hofstra again clawed its way back with a 9-0 spurt capped by a Bond jumper. Berry answered with a transition three, and after a Bond layup, Berry found Clark open at the top of the key for another triple to take the 69-61 lead.
But Harvard turned it over on back-to-back possessions, and moments later, the lead was back down to four. Loper’s three got the Pride as close as one, but it never was able to pull ahead.
“Those comebacks are part of the game,” Delaney-Smith explained. “They threw a zone at us, which is something that set us back on our heels.... We started to let them have more boards than I wanted, we started walking the ball up the floor instead of pushing the ball up the floor. That sort of took us out of the game that had gotten us the 10-point lead.”
Clark finished with 23 and seven rebounds, as she and Berry combined for two-thirds of the Crimson’s points. Evans, an All-American last season, had 24 and 16 for Hofstra in a losing effort, as Harvard was able to win despite 25 turnovers thanks to a 47-percent shooting night from the field.
“This is the kind of team we don’t see that much,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought we were undersized; we did as good a job you can do on [Evans] as mismatched as we were.... I was very, very proud of the team effort.”
