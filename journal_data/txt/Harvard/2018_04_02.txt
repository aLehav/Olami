After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You’re just white enough. That’s why I like you,” he said through a toothy smile.
My white then-boyfriend joked as I sat next to him in the car. I had been telling him about a meeting I had gone to earlier that day. A group of black students had been joking about the lack of seasoning in white food and had turned to me to say, “No offense.”
Something like this had never happened to me before. Strangers had come up to me speaking Spanish all the time. I grew up considering myself to be very brown, as I am the darkest in my family. I am praised by my family for my ability to tan—I’ve never burned. I considered myself very visibly Latina.
It is only in the past few years that I’ve been coming to terms with the fact that my brownness is only a few drops mixed into the European whiteness that took over South America. In my light-skinned, Colombian household I may have been dark, but in the larger world I could fit into whiteness more comfortably than most people of color.
What had bothered me about this statement was that it furthered this feeling of cognitive dissonance I had been experiencing. What bothered me most was that he had felt comfortable enough to say that to me. I was white enough for him to think that was okay. I was white enough for him to think I wouldn’t get offended. How did I get to this point?
***
In middle school, I began taking the higher-level classes that brought me into a predominantly white friend group. My school was pretty diverse, but the classes I was in were not. I could blend in pretty well physically with my white friends, who mostly came from the wealthier part of town. I didn’t look like much of an anomaly in our group pictures. But the differences began to become more noticeable as I tried to conform to a more educated, white culture only to face reminders of my reality.
Our differences presented themselves in small things, like when I had to answer the phone in Spanish around them. It was presented in the small comments made that I didn’t notice so much when I was young: “Oh my god. Do you, like, live in the ghetto?” one of them asked when I was given a ride home after a birthday party.
***
In high school, I was the only Latina again in several of my AP classes. I was considered at least “white enough” to be in them because I was smart. Teachers gave me a chance because the racial barrier was smaller to overcome. It was easier to get ahead with stereotypes not holding me down as much as some of my peers. I also learned that whiteness is not only seen as the color of your skin; it is attributed with intelligence and wealth. Being a person of color meant poverty and lack of intelligence or laziness.
Even my name—the way I allowed others to use it before college—was “white enough.” Laura Veira. There was no trace of Latinidad in the English pronunciation of my first name and constant mispronunciation of Veira as Viera. I introduced myself that way. I Americanized myself to make it easier for others, at the cost of my own identity.
I was, to some extent, scared of my Latinidad. I didn’t recognize how much I had kept it hidden in order to fit into my friend groups. Looking back now, I recognize that my academic success made me feel like an exception—like I could belong in this white world. After all, I only felt confident enough to date a white boy after I got into Harvard. All my previous boyfriends had been Latino because I didn’t feel inferior to them. Getting into Harvard proved I was “white enough.” I became somebody he could be proud to bring home to his family despite our different backgrounds.
***
Ironically enough, getting into Harvard had made me feel like I could finally start identifying more as Latina. It wasn’t exactly my choice at first. I had posted my acceptance reaction video without giving much thought to the language it was in. I had opened it with my parents so most of it was in Spanish. People I knew claimed that I had only been admitted  because of affirmative action. While some challenged my acceptance, others reached out to me letting me know how much I had inspired them as a Latina going to Harvard.
I felt more like an outsider coming in. My distance from whiteness at Harvard was much greater. But I was able to find a home in my Latinx community. I have felt more connected at Harvard than I had been in middle and high school, which were times in my life where I was siloed into spaces where I was sometimes the only Latina. I began embracing my Latinidad more as I realized I had gone my entire life letting others define me.
I fought back as I started introducing myself as Laura the way it was meant to be pronounced in Spanish. I fought back as I began using the hyphenated Ramírez in my last name. My resume now proudly displays my full name with accents and everything: Laura Sofía Veira-Ramírez.
***
This past summer, an incoming Latina freshman came up to me asking about the way I pronounced my name. She had always Americanized her own and was intrigued to hear the way I introduced myself. I was caught off guard by the observation and realized how far I had come, having only been at Harvard for a year. I was glad to hear her pronouncing her name in Spanish when introducing herself the next day.
I am trying to decolonize my mind. I am trying to reclaim my Latinidad. I am trying to take myself out of this white mold into which I have tried to force myself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My parents were initially displeased with my decision to join the Army. My mother is a staunch pacifist who grew up hating Cold War America. Her friends were murdered by American-backed death squads, so her feelings for the U.S. military were ambivalent at best. My father was slightly subtler in his opposition. As the deadline for accepting my Army scholarship approached, he asked me to read “The War Prayer,” hoping Mark Twain’s words would turn me away from the butchery of war.
My father’s tactics failed, but not because I was ignorant. I read "The War Prayer." I knew about the U.S.’s crimes in Vietnam and Central America. I agreed that the occupation of Afghanistan was a poorly managed campaign of mistakes, a catastrophe only overshadowed by the largest geopolitical disaster of the twenty-first century—the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
But rather than dissuade me, my parents’ opinions only vindicated my decision to join. With the overconfidence of your typical 18-year-old, I viewed America’s blunders as a call to arms. The Army needed people like me, or so I arrogantly thought. I could minimize the damage of the Iraq War. I could help turn the tide of war in Afghanistan. I could transform America’s Army into a global force for good.
My freshman year only heightened my sense of self-worth. Our campus culture is that of a divinely-chosen people convinced of their God-given right to lead. After all, our club presidencies and service as athletic captains in high school bought us our tickets to Harvard. Likewise, our status as collegiate leaders (as outlined by our exaggerated resumes) will undoubtedly provide us with “real-world” managerial positions—or so we tell ourselves.
I fell for this myth hook, line, and sinker. By the end of my freshman year, I single-handedly made up 50 percent of the Class of 2018’s Army cadet contingent. Surely the Army would recognize—no, cherish—my rarity. I was Harvard’s gift to America’s Army, a savior destined to redeem my nation’s military sins.
My first session of Army training that summer quickly crushed my reformist dreams of military grandeur. When hiking through the Ohio Valley’s humid, tick-ridden marshes, soldiers don’t want to talk about the President’s National Security Strategy or the harmful relationship between civilian contractors and the Army’s counterinsurgency efforts. Soldiers want to eat and drink. Soldiers want to sleep. More importantly, soldiers want soldiers with the skills needed to make these activities possible (and talking isn’t one of them).
After about a week or so into training, no one bothers to remember what school you go to. No one cares about the research you did with that one professor last summer. No one cares about your blog, social initiative, or athletic achievements. Can you tie a bowline knot? Can you clear a machine gun? Can you march in silence for hours on end? Can you lead a platoon-sized ambush? While seemingly simple, these skills are what distinguish great Cadets from the rest.
I was not a great Cadet that first summer. I was not a complete imbecile either, but my mediocrity bothered me. I hadn’t left any sort of impact on the Army’s warfighting structure. I hadn’t done my part to destroy the bureaucracy currently strangling the Army’s capacity for institutional change. Instead, I struggled to tie knots. I mistreated my blisters. I improperly threw a grenade. I did nothing of consequence.
Yet as I sharpened these seemingly mundane skills, my peers lent me their ears. We shot the breeze, exchanged jokes, and told tall tales. Sometimes we discussed the evils of black licorice jellybeans. Sometimes we argued about the Army’s future as a humanitarian force. Sometimes we found comfort in each other’s silence as we stared into the night sky and thought to ourselves, “Man, I hate this place.”
These smaller, seemingly inconsequential human moments are where long-term change is born. I can’t shape incoming national security adviser John R. Bolton’s opinion of the Iran nuclear deal. I can’t change the President’s strategy for Syria. But I can befriend a future infantryman from Nebraska. I can advise a future general from West Virginia. I can change the mind of a future special operations commander from Puerto Rico. Through doing so, I may play a small role in sparking the cultural change needed to prevent America’s next military disaster.
In an odd sense, our campus culture is right; each of us is a leader in our own, humble capacity. Yes, you can spend your evenings drafting worthless emails. You can spend your days sweating your soul away under the hot Kentucky sun. You can even spend your evenings writing for The Harvard Crimson. And yet, your friends are America’s future voters. Your peers are America’s future soldiers. Your neighbors are America’s future pioneers. Thus, the unplanned moments we share with others provide us with unimaginable influence, an influence capable of driving the institutional change we seek.
So go forth. Debate your roommates. Send that funny email to your coworkers. Convert life’s mundane moments into memorable ones—not only for yourself, but for those around you. You might not trigger the next great piece of legislation, but you might just shape its future authors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Yardfest will truly be one to remember.
The College Events Board recently announced that rappers Lil Yachty and Wale will perform at Yardfest, a College-wide concert held each spring. As with any musical selection, students who enjoy the styles of rap Lil Yachty and Wale perform were no doubt overjoyed, and those who prefer other music were disappointed. It is unrealistic to believe that the CEB’s decision, or any decision, would please all students, a dilemma the group must have considered. In this situation, it was right to select two relatively popular artists such as these two.
Lil Yachty is currently one of the most popular artists in the music world. One of the reasons people enjoy his music so much is because of his innovative style of rap, known as “bubblegum trap,” that samples from the diverse sounds of the Mario video game series, animated cartoons of Charlie Brown, and the “Rugrats” television show. Thus, it’s not a surprise that with hit songs such as “Minnesota” and “Night,” Lil Yachty and his music is listened to not only in the United States, but across the world. Additionally, Lil Yachty has a large social media presence—his Instagram account has over 5 million followers, and his posts on the social media interface have garnered upwards of 800,000 likes. To a lesser extent, Wale also fulfills this same description. With hits like “Chillin,” “Pretty Girls,” and “World Tour,” he is most certainly well-known, if less so than Lil Yachty.
Furthermore, by inviting two rappers, the CEB bucked the electronic dance music trend that characterized the 2016 selection of Steve Aoki and the 2017 pick of Tiësto. This was a wise move—by increasing the diversity of Yardfest artists’ styles, the CEB makes it more likely that students who dislike the selected artist one year may enjoy performances to come.
Importantly, a great Yardfest cannot occur without proper funding. Thus, we hope the Office of Student Life will adequately and transparently finance Yardfest and accompanying events, instead of following last year’s decision to ask the Undergraduate Council for assistance. In particular, last year’s “block parties” were successful not only in engendering student enthusiasm for the concert but also in bringing students together across to enjoy food, drink, and games across Houses and class years.
This is especially true for freshmen, who were just assigned into Houses, and thus should be getting to know their future House communities and and immersing themselves in House spirit. Indeed, freshmen can often feel isolated from upperclassmen, given the physical distance from the Yard to both the River and Quad Houses. If organized and funded properly, this event could be a step toward changing that, serving as a bridge to welcome them to the community of House life at Harvard.
Regardless of who performs, we hope all Harvard students enjoy a wonderful afternoon of safe, enjoyable fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, one of Harvard’s numerous high-level committees released another report. For those who habitually delete emails from president@harvard.edu, the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging came out with final recommendations. Snappily entitled “Pursuing Excellence on a Foundation of Inclusion,” the report consists of almost 80 brightly colored pages and contains eight recommendations. One of those eight, which has attracted notable media attention, changes the school’s alma mater. Its last lines will now read, “Be the herald of Light, and the bearer of Love, Till the stars in the firmament die.” (The latter part replaces “Till the stock of the Puritans die.”)
University President Drew G. Faust proudly asserts this new line will recognize “that the pursuit of truth and knowledge belongs to everyone at Harvard, from all backgrounds and beliefs.” Perhaps. And perhaps seven words in an obscure song do not merit much attention. But I fear the change underscores something else about “the pursuit of truth and knowledge” at the College: Even as Faust runs from Aspen to Davos promoting the importance of the liberal arts, that pursuit is increasingly concentrated in the pure and applied sciences, rather than in the humanities and social sciences. This lyric change, replacing a historical line with a scientific one, seems to ratify that shift.
I mean concentrated literally, since concentrator numbers reflect this disturbing shift.  I am not trying to launch an attack against postmodernism and political correctness in academia in and of itself, and those interested in such fare can easily find it. Yet as the scholarship of the humanities and social sciences has become more postmodern, more politically correct, and, yes, more centered on issues of inclusion and belonging, the pure and applied sciences overwhelmingly have not. In response, my peers have voted with their feet. From 2008 to 2016, English, History, and Government departments have seen their number of concentrators decline from 236 to 144, 231 to 146, and 477 to 333 respectively. Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science have meanwhile seen surges from 101 to 279, 17 to 163, and 86 to 363, respectively. This cannot merely be due to rising interest in science and technology, as psychology, a humanistic department that still focuses on method over values, has seen concentrator numbers hold steady.
Diminishing interest in the History Department especially stings, since it is not only Faust’s department but also my own. This spring, 253 undergraduates are slogging through Computer Science 124: “Data Structures and Algorithms.” Meanwhile, the most popular History class has 83 enrollees. No other History offering enrolls over 50. Our poor enrollment cannot be because of an underlying disinterest in the liberal arts. Foundational and mainstream liberal arts courses from ER18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory” to Government 1510: “American Constitutional Law” to Economics 1017: “A Libertarian Perspective on Economic and Social Policy” pack lecture halls with hundreds. Likewise, history’s most popular classes this year dealt with the conventional topics of American capitalism and the Vietnam War. And enrollment in my department pales in comparison not only to other departments, but also (say it softly) to the history department at Yale. This spring, five Yale history courses had over 100 students planning to enroll. Last fall, 176 students attended Paul M. Kennedy’s “Military History of the West Since 1500.” Harvard offers no similarly broad course and no Cold War survey course. Instead, we have “Cold War in the Global South.” Meanwhile, History 1046: “Islamicate Societies to 1500” “addresses the topics of gender and religious minorities in Islamicate societies,” in a lecture with just six undergraduate enrollees. As the humanistic departments have focused increasing attention on ensuring everyone feels included and studied in their syllabi, they have seemingly cared less about whether undergraduates as a whole actually want their new offerings. Meanwhile, the University has appointed excellent historians of traditional power politics in recent years—at the Business and Kennedy Schools.
I value diversity and inclusion, as well as all quality scholarship (including on gender and religious minorities). I am not the enemy here. Empty classrooms are. The fact is that those departments which have prioritized diverse scholarship the most and have moved the furthest away from supposedly antiquated traditional subjects are bleeding undergraduates the fastest. By failing to provide foundational courses undergraduates want to take, they are only speeding the flow from CGIS and Emerson Hall to the shiny new Allston campus. Correlation may not always mean causation. But the laudable push for inclusion and the lamentable decline of the most inclusive departments are perversely linked. With a new president and dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences incoming, we now have an opportunity to seriously address this phenomenon of bright flight.
My nightmare is this: Instead of changing course, my department and those like it will double down. They will prioritize “envisioning new intellectual fields, new perspectives into existing fields, and new means of interacting with a dynamic and ever-changing student body,” as Faust advocates. FAS’s History Department will eagerly look to the $10 million committed to “new faculty hires who have the promise to make a profound impact on our belonging and inclusion efforts through their scholarship, teaching, backgrounds, and life experiences.” Meanwhile, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will prioritize new faculty hires who have the promise to make a profound impact on the wider world. SEAS will use the $400 million from John A. Paulson to focus on biomedical engineering and artificial intelligence. The upshot, five or 10 years from now, could be humanistic departments that increasingly reflect our proclaimed values even as they teach fewer and fewer of our students. Nobody wins in that scenario, in which Harvard becomes a Vassar joined at the hip to an MIT.
I have no doubt that Harvard will remain an excellent institution to attend, get a banking job, and get out. And as a Jewish Cold War historian, I feel as little ownership over the distant stars as I do over Puritan stock. At Commencement just over a year from now, I will happily sing the alma mater’s new lines. I will do so next to my roommates, who study biology and computer science. Amidst the chorus I will look over at them, fearing that my liberal arts Harvard, inclusive and shrinking, may meet a lonely fate long before the stars in the firmament begin to flicker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Assistant Physics professor Cora Dvorkin was named the 2018 Harvard Scientist of the Year by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations last month.
Each year, student interns at the Harvard Foundation nominate a scientist they believe deserves recognition for his or her extraordinary work in science, engineering, and mathematics. Previous recipients of the Harvard Scientist of the Year award include Nobel laureate Takaaki Kajita and Astronomy professor Alyssa A. Goodman.
“I was very pleasantly surprised,” Dvorkin said of receiving the award. “It was exciting to see that I’m recognized not only by my colleagues but also by the students of Harvard, which really are the ones who make Harvard.”
Dvorkin, a former fellow of the Institute for Theory and Computation at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, is a theoretical cosmologist who studies the origins and composition of the early universe. Her research group draws on data gathered by satellites and telescopes located all over the world to characterize and measure the cosmic microwave background, which she defines as “the afterglow coming from the Big Bang.”
In a scientific article published earlier this year, Dvorkin and two postdoctoral fellows from her research group examined the statistics of galaxy distributions in order to observe the signatures of massive spinning particles—particles that may have been present right after the Big Bang. Her research group also seeks to understand more about the particle nature of dark matter.
In addition to pursuing research, Dvorkin also teaches Physics 15c: “Wave Phenomena,” an undergraduate-level course offered in the spring, and Physics 212: “Cosmology,” a graduate-level course offered in the fall. Dvorkin created the latter class in 2016.
“This is a new course that didn’t exist before in the Physics Department, and it has been pretty successful,” Dvorkin said, referring to Physics 212. “Students seem to like it a lot.”
The nomination praised Dvorkin for her “significant contributions to the field of physics and cosmology” and for her “engagement with students on Harvard College’s campus.”
Dvorkin accepted the Scientist of the Year award at  a ceremony and luncheon held Friday and at the "Albert Einstein Science Conference: Advancing Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics" held Saturday. The Albert Einstein Science Conference is an annual conference hosted by the Harvard Foundation that aims to get children interested in science.
“These young students come from public schools around the area, and they have different ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds,” Dvorkin said. “I think it’s important to target students—girls and boys at the very young ages, especially the ones who perhaps have difficulties accessing a science course, or perhaps they don’t have a role model who looks like them.”
Several student interns at the Harvard Foundation did not respond to requests for comment on Dvorkin’s nomination and receipt of the organization’s annual award.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An app that College students use to place grill orders in campus dining halls went down on Friday and Saturday, temporarily preventing undergraduates from ordering their grilled cheese and french fries online.
The Mange app, which enables students to place grill orders using tablets in Harvard's food serveries or remotely via their phones, is typically available during lunch and dinner in the dining halls of all of  Harvard’s 12 residential Houses. The app notifies students via email when their grill orders are fully cooked and ready for consumption.
Crista Martin, a spokesperson for Harvard University Dining Services, wrote in an email that staff first noticed the app was not working Friday evening, around the time dinner service began.
With the digital ordering service unavailable, students and grill chefs resorted to more primitive means. On Friday, Lowell House students filled out paper slips to place orders, while the Adams House grill chefs took orders by word-of-mouth.
The app regained functionality during lunch Saturday after Harvard information technology workers resolved the problem, according to Martin.
“As with any IT system, periodic outages happen and are inconvenient,” she wrote. “We are very fortunate to have a great IT team who resolved the problem quickly so we could return to the normal routine in less than 24 hours.”
Cabot House first began using the app in Feb. 2016. Enrique A. Dominguez-Meneses ’16 developed the app; he said at the time he hoped the technology would reduce crowds at dining hall grills.
The app was also meant to reduce food waste. Mange prevents students who abandon their orders twice from placing remote orders in the future.  In recent years, HUDS has worked to reduce the amount of food squandered in dining halls, conducting an annual “food audit,” among other measures.
After a test run at Cabot, the app was rolled out at all House dining halls—all spaces used primarily by upperclassmen. Freshmen, who typically eat in Annenberg Hall, still place grill orders with a paper slip.
When the College updated its “Omni @Harvard College” app last year, it integrated Mange into the new interface.

Over 700 attendees admired student artwork adorning the walls and listened to performances at the Ed Portal in Allston as part of the opening reception for a Harvard student-hosted art show Saturday.
For the second year running, the Harvard Student Art Collective—the student group that organizes the show—collaborated with the Ed Portal and the Ceramics Program to put on the event.
Now in its tenth year, the show features over 100 pieces of artwork stemming from a variety of artistic disciplines and produced by students representing seven of Harvard’s schools. The exhibit will last five weeks, running through "ARTS FIRST," the University’s arts festival which will run April 26-29.
During the reception, student curators led tours of the exhibit while attendees from Harvard and Allston pondered the art and student performances.
Dasha Bough ’21, who displayed work in the show, wrote in an email Sunday that she thought opening night was filled with “intense excitement” that encouraged student experimentation and celebrated art.
“The curation in and of itself is beautiful. It’s accessible in a way that leads you comfortably through the space, but nuanced enough to give every viewer a unique experience,” she wrote.
Sophie Kissinger ’18, one of the co-directors of the Harvard Student Art Collective, wrote in an email Sunday she was “thrilled” with opening night of the show.
“Last night really felt like a meeting of the minds for the Harvard artistic community. The performances were absolutely vibrant, and the work sparked a ton of interesting conversation,” Kissinger wrote. “Our hope is that it inspired people to hold more events that bring people at and around Harvard together to celebrate student art.”
The student art show debuted ten years ago in the Science Center Plaza, before moving to 29 Garden, the Cambridge Trust Company, and then, the Center for Government and International Studies Knafel basement. Organizers held the event at the Ed Portal for the first time last year.
As part of the show’s planning process, a committee of students hailing from throughout the University reviewed submissions from 95 artists and whittled the choices down to pieces from 45 artists.
Bough wrote that she submitted work “to free myself of my perfectionism by seizing opportunities for exposure and criticism.” At the show, she displayed a sand art film on the Cold War titled “Boiling Point,” a stop-motion film titled “We Do Not Know,” and a pastel portrait of a young man.
Founded in 2008, the Ed Portal hosts a number of educational programs open to local residents, including 35 arts and culture events this year geared toward people of all ages. Future events include a workshop on mini matinees for middle school students and a class on writing and illustrating fairy tales for elementary school students slated for April 7.

UPDATED: April 2, 2018 at 1:11 a.m.
Vikram Sundar ’18 was recently named one of 16 Churchill Scholars from a pool of 101 nominations, allowing him to pursue a fully funded master’s degree at the University of Cambridge next fall.
Sundar, who will graduate this spring with a degree in mathematics and a secondary in chemistry, as well as a master’s in physics, is the only Harvard student to receive the prestigious scholarship this year.
Launched in 1963 in honor of Winston Churchill, the scholarship provides awardees with a year of study at Churchill College in Cambridge. The scholarship supports students studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics “with the goal of advancing science and technology on both sides of the Atlantic, helping to ensure our future prosperity and security,” according to its website.
Sundar said he is looking forward to pursuing his research project: exploring computational techniques to model protein-ligand binding in a new cultural and academic environment.
“I get to be in a community of really intelligent and really driven people who are interested in a lot of the same things as I am,” Sundar said.
Alán Aspuru-Guzik, professor of chemistry and chemical biology and Sundar’s current research advisor, said he is not surprised by Sundar’s achievement.
“Vikram is an outstanding student. He has always been an excellent researcher,” Aspuru-Guzik said.
Sundar said he first became interested in research in high school, when he pursued projects in computational biology. But it wasn’t until he took organic chemistry at Harvard that he found his current area of interest, which falls in the field of computational chemistry.
Sundar said his goals extend beyond purely academic achievement. He hopes to use computational techniques and his knowledge of physics and chemistry to come up with new and better ways to treat diseases.
“That’s broader than just whatever degree I get,” Sundar said.
Aspuru-Guzik said he thinks Sundar's potential is boundless.
“For people like Vikram, the sky’s the limit," he said. "As long as he continues being such a humble, talented, young man, he will go as far as he wants,” he said.
To date, Harvard students have received over 40 Churchill scholarships, the most recent earned by Daniel H. Rothchild ’17, who pursued a master’s in physics at Cambridge in the 2017-18 academic year.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 2, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated Vikram Sundar '18 is pursuing a joint degree in math and chemistry. In fact, he is pursuing a concentration in math and a secondary in chemistry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some students praised the final report released by a University-wide task force on inclusion and belonging last week, noting the report's authors clearly took campus feedback on an earlier draft into account. 
The report—meant to help  ensure "full membership in the Harvard community" for historically marginalized groups—recommends an evaluation of the University’s values statement, increased funding for faculty diversification, and the creation of two centers, one for “Identity, Politics, and Culture” and one for “Inclusion and Belonging.” The report also recommends that the Office of the President and Provost appoint a central administrator to oversee these proposals.
The final report follows the release of a draft report in September that drew criticism from many students for failing to explicitly address long-running student advocacy for initiatives like the creation of an ethnic studies concentration and a multicultural center. At the time, Government Professor Danielle S. Allen, who co-chaired the task force, said Ethnic Studies proposals were excluded from the University-wide report because they were “College-specific.”
Following the release of the draft report, the task force made extensive efforts to garner feedback from across the University before publishing their final report, according to Allen.
“The task force members were just incredible in terms of getting out and talking to people and doing outreach sessions,” she said. “We spent the fall just traveling from one school to another, hearing people’s responses to the report.”
After seeing last week's report, many students said they think the final version of the document proves task force members seriously considered and incorporated undergraduate feedback. Salma Abdelrahman ’20, who co-leads the Multicultural Center Coalition, said she thinks the task force definitely mulled her and others' arguments in favor of a physical space for cultural groups on campus.
“I think that space became a much bigger issue after we brought up the concerns to task force members, so I think that heightened the awareness around the implications of space on campus after the conversation after the draft report,” Abdelrahman said.
Sally Chen ’19, an ethnic studies advocate, also said she thinks undergraduate advocacy—as well as outreach conducted by the task force—helped kick start a campus-wide conversation centered on issues of diversity, belonging, and inclusion.
“It did seem that Danielle Allen and the folks involved did take into consideration some of the concerns that were raised, and I do think that it was a great opportunity to get a lot of this dialogue across,” she said.
While ethnic studies did not earn an explicit mention in the final report, William Oh ’18, a member of the task force, said the proposed  center for ‘Identity, Politics, and Culture’ comprises an opportunity for faculty to spearhead their own vision for the future of ethnic studies.
“As someone who’s really involved in the advocacy behind that, from what I have heard, I’m really excited by faculty who are coming together to really support that,” Oh said. “I think that the report makes it clear that the label of ‘Identity, Politics, and Culture’ is simply a placeholder. It’s a placeholder to leave space for the faculty, who are ultimately going to be leading the intellectual center."
Abdelrahman also said, though she thinks some language in the report is vague, she is optimistic about University President Drew G. Faust’s assertion in a University-wide email she sent last week that “inclusive symbols and spaces obviously extend well beyond the Smith Center.”
“The report can’t make any specific recommendations for specific schools, so as a University task force, I think the language was necessarily broad for that reason,” Abdelrahman said. “The language around inclusive symbols and spaces that extends well beyond the Smith Campus Center is a very important point in the report and I think it was important enough that she included it in her summary.”
Nevertheless, when it comes to implementing the task force’s recommendations, some students said they think the process may be slow-moving.
Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, a task force member and former Undergraduate Council vice president, said the process of studying issues, forming committees, and releasing reports often seems frustrating to undergraduates, who tend to want immediate results. He said being on the committee allowed him to see the importance of prolonged discussion, a long-term view, and the involvement of voices from across the University.
“We’re thinking ‘Oh, what’s going to happen tomorrow and next semester, the next one or four years that I’m here?’ The task force, I think one of the best things that it does is take a long term view of this, so I think that they did a great job reaching out to all sorts of constituencies,” Khansarinia said.
“There are a lot of things that can happen going forward,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 2, 2018 at 3:25 p.m.
An alumni coalition focused on increasing diversity at Harvard endorsed five candidates in this year’s Board of Overseers election and five alumni candidates in the race for an elected director position on the board of the Harvard Alumni Association.
The alumni group, Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, formed in 2016 in response to a controversial outsider ticket in that year’s Board of Overseers election. The controversial ticket ran on a platform of abolishing tuition and increasing transparency in the undergraduate admissions process, which they contended may discriminate against Asian-American immigrants. The coalition charged that the ticket’s proposals were antithetical to diversity and chose to endorse five other candidates. The group also endorsed five candidates in last year’s election.
The Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, advises the University President on major institutional decisions. Its members serve for six-year terms. Harvard degree holders vote every spring to elect five new members.
This year, out of eight candidates total, the Coalition backed the following five: Geraldine Acuña-Sunshine, Marilyn Holifield, John C. Lechleiter, Yvette Roubideaux, and Diego A. Rodriguez.
In the election for directors to the Harvard Alumni Association’s board, the Coalition backed five out of nine candidates: Sid Espinosa, Rashid Muhammed Yasin ’12, Krishnan Namboodiri Subrahmanian ’03, Natosha Reid Rice ’93, and Bella T. Wong ’82.
On its website, the Coalition wrote the group looks for leaders who will be “proactive in helping Harvard be a more diverse institution.”
The group’s online endorsements specifically mention Roubideaux’s background as “likely” the first Native American candidate and Epinosa’s experience as the first openly gay mayor of Palo Alto.
The Coalition based its endorsements on a questionnaire it circulates each year to candidates, asking them to answer five questions about their stances on affirmative action, ideas for increasing diversity at the University, and professional experience with diversity and inclusion initiatives, among others. Seven of the eight Overseers candidates and all of the HAA candidates completed the survey.
Michael G. Williams ’81, a member of the Coalition, said the group looks for individuals who they think have been “a leader in diversity efforts” and will advocate for diversity at Harvard, based on their responses to the questionnaire.
Williams emphasized the Coalition’s support for affirmative action—a stance against which they measure candidates.
“I think most of the endorsees this year if not all of them, in their responses, clearly expressed support for race-conscious admissions,” he said.
Ballots for the election were sent to Harvard degree holders Sunday. Alumni must return ballots to the Harvard Alumni Association by May 15 in order for their votes to count.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote on a proposal to create a new engineering concentration and discuss a new Ph.D. program in business administration at its monthly meeting Tuesday.
The proposal seeks to establish an Environmental Science and Engineering concentration within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  The Faculty first discussed the possibility of adding a new concentration at its last meeting in March, when Professor Daniel P. Schrag presented the proposal.
If the proposal passes, it will bring the number of concentrations Harvard offers  undergraduates up to 50. The College most recently added the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration in 2015.
Environmental Science and Engineering is currently a track within the Engineering Sciences concentration. It is the only area of study within Engineering Sciences that does not have its own separate concentration. Students can already concentrate in Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Electrical Engineering.
The Faculty Council voted unanimously in February in favor of the new concentration, but their vote is purely advisory.
At the last faculty meeting, Schrag explained that the new concentration does not significantly deviate from the environmental engineering track that students can currently pursue under Engineering Sciences at SEAS. Instead, Schrag said, the new concentration will allow for more flexibility in the curriculum. The new Environmental Science and Engineering concentration will grant students a Bachelor of Arts degree upon completion.
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria will also present a proposal at the Faculty meeting. He will argue in favor of the creation of a new Ph.D. program in Business Administration to be jointly offered by HBS and FAS.
Under the proposal, the new Ph.D. program will replace the existing Doctor of Business Administration degree. The change is needed to better reflect the work D.B.A. students do and to strengthen their disciplinary training, according to the proposal.
“An interfaculty Ph.D. in Business Administration will facilitate closer connections between HBS and FAS faculty members and doctoral students, and further enhance training in the disciplines and the quality of business and management-related research at the University,” the proposal reads.
Nohria’s proposal already garnered the support of the Faculty Council at a meeting last month. While the proposal is up for discussion only at this meeting, the Faculty will be able to vote directly on the proposal at its next meeting in May.

The Office of Student Life and the Freshman Dean’s Office will merge into a new office—called the Dean of Students Office—starting on July 1, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to students Monday.
Khurana said in an interview last week that administrators are merging the two offices to “integrate and strengthen the four-year residential experience.”
“This new office will centralize services that are currently offered by both the OSL and the FDO in a way that ensures continuity in the extensive support systems–both academic and residential–that are available to all students,” he wrote in the email to students Monday.
Currently, the FDO and OSL split oversight of residential and social life at the College. The FDO—comprising roughly a dozen full-time staff members—administers programming for freshmen. The OSL—which boasts nearly double that number of staffers—provides support for student organizations, housing operations, and College-wide diversity initiatives. The OSL also partners with upperclassmen House management to oversee residential and social programming for sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, who currently oversees the Office of Student Life, will lead the joint office, according to Khurana. The OSL currently sits on the first floor of University Hall while the FDO has its own building on Prescott Street, and O’Dair said in an interview last week that administrators have not yet determined whether the two offices will remain split between their respective locations or whether the new office will occupy a new spot on campus.
“We haven’t determined the physical spaces yet,” O’Dair said.
The new administrative structure of the Dean of Students Office also means the College will effectively cancel the position of dean of first-year students, occupied since 2004 by Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. Dingman announced in Nov. 2017 he plans to step down from his position at the end of the academic year; given the merger, the College will not seek his replacement.
Instead, administrators in the Dean of Students Office will divide up the responsibilities that currently fall under the purview of the Freshman Dean’s Office. Specifically, one administrator will oversee freshman residential life in the new organizational structure, according to O’Dair.
In an email sent to students Monday, Khurana wrote the new office will be responsible for four main areas of the Harvard College experience: residential life, student experience, equity, diversity, and inclusion, and student advising.
In an interview, O’Dair said “senior folks” and “resident deans”—including resident deans of freshmen, who will each continue to oversee one neighborhood of Yard dorms—will support first-year residential life.
But not all roles in the new office are set in stone.
As part of the transition, the College will also create new administrative positions that consolidate some responsibilities currently managed by the FDO with others currently managed by the OSL.
O’Dair said administrators are “beginning” the work of figuring out exactly what those new positions will entail now. In his email, Khurana wrote O’Dair will “announce further details” ahead of the July 1 launch.
According to Khurana’s email, the new structure comes partially as a response to student feedback requesting a smoother transition from Yard to House life. In the interview last week, Khurana said he has been considering joining the OSL and the FDO almost since he became dean of the College in 2014.
He said he “talked to everyone” when deciding whether and how to prosecute the merger, including Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, O’Dair, and other senior leaders in FAS.
“I don’t know if you’ve ever noticed but I love asking people for advice,” Khurana said.
Khurana wrote in the email he is excited about the merger.
“While I will miss working with Dean Dingman after he retires, I am excited about the new possibilities that will be created by the DSO,” he wrote. “I am confident that taking this step will boost the College’s efforts to support a residential and social experience that is welcoming, open, and accessible to all students.”

UPDATED: April 2, 201 8 at 1:08 a.m.
As a second election to determine whether eligible student assistants will form a union approaches, at least one anti-unionization graduate student is increasing his efforts to reach voters through a series of informational videos with University administrators.
Ph.D. student Jae Hyeon Lee, a member of Against HGSU-UAW—a loosely organized group of graduate students who oppose the effort to form a union—released a series of videos last week recording interviews with University administrators about issues related to unionization. Administrators featured included Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean of Finance and Administration Allen D. Aloise and University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran.
HGSU-UAW stands for Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, a pro-unionization advocacy group.
Lee wrote in an email that he first reached out to administrators to propose the project about a year ago.
“At that time I reached out to several administrators for an interview but they all declined the request,” Lee wrote. “This is for an understandable reason that people, in general, fear the possibility of their words being misinterpreted or used against them.”
“I hope that the videos will generate informed and thoughtful questions regarding the unionization and will help some students cast a more informed vote on the election day,” he added.
In the videos, administrators discussed the GSAS budget process, student stipends and benefits, and the negotiating powers of a graduate student union. Questions asked included the query whether the University could “drastically increase” student benefits without “compromises elsewhere.”
Though individual administrators—including University President Drew G. Faust—have expressed skepticism regarding unionization in the past, the University has never adopted an official stance on unionization in communications to students, instead encouraging eligible students to vote and providing links to pro- and anti-unionization sources.
“As we move toward the election, it is critically important to consider the issues at stake and engage in a robust conversation about the potential impact of unionization,” Curran wrote in emails to students in January, February, and March.
Curran’s emails also contained links to resources from the Office of the Provost’s website, HGSU-UAW, Against HGSU-UAW, and "Graduate Student Unionization: A Critical Approach," a blog run by Lee.
Former National Labor Relations Board Chairman William B. Gould IV said the type of advocacy permitted by the University is mostly determined by the election agreement between the union and the University.
“If the employer has entered into an agreement not to engage in a certain kind of conduct, and it does it in concert with third parties, it would seem to me that that would be a basis for upsetting the agreement and providing for a re-run election in the event that the union does not get a majority of the votes,” Gould said. “But it depends on the extent to which the University is acting with the third parties.”
Beyond its legal obligation to refrain from coercing eligible voters, the University has not made a formal commitment to remain neutral in the run-up to the election. Under labor law, employers are also obligated to provide unions with voter lists, in part so that union advocates can relay arguments in favor of unionization.
These required voter lists formed a point of contention during the 2016 unionization election. After over a year of legal back-and-forth, the National Labor Relations Board determined the University-generated list was inadequate and ordered a second election.
In response to Lee’s videos, HGSU-UAW organizer Andrew B. Donnelly wrote in an email that the union has reached out to GSAS to ask if administrators will make a similar set of videos with union representatives, though no such interviews have been scheduled.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 2, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated Jae Hyeon Lee created the video series of interviews with administrators on behalf of Against HGSU-UAW. In fact, Lee created the videos entirely on his own and not on behalf of the organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 2, 2018 at 11 p.m.
Speakers across academic disciplines discussed environmental “toxicity” and its relationship to racially marginalized segments of the population at a symposium held by the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology Friday.
At the event, titled "Toxic Tales, Body Burdens, and Climatic Conundrums," speakers ranging from professors to current students spoke about issues like climate change, ecotourism, and race relations. The speakers also discussed the representation of environmental issues in contemporary media and older works of folklore and mythology.
The symposium’s primary organizer and head tutor and lecturer in the department, Ruth Goldstein, said she chose the theme because of the enduring focus on environmental toxins in the news and because of her own experiences growing up in Baltimore, where lead paint contamination formed a central challenge for African American communities.
Environmental racism, which Goldstein defined as the disproportionate exposure of racially marginalized groups to environmental contamination coupled with a lack of resources or opportunities to address these problems, comprised a main topic canvassed at the symposium. Goldstein said she designed the event to be inclusive of scholars of color whose work and personal experiences would be especially relevant and valuable to the discussion.
As part of the day-long event, organizers also held a panel honoring Germanic Languages and Literatures and Folklore and Mythology professor Maria Tatar, who has previously taught popular classes at the College on fairy tales and children’s literature.
Tiffany L. King, an assistant professor at Georgia State University, gave the keynote address, speaking about cartography, the environment of plantations, and the significance of indigo dye production in the daily lives of slaves. King emphasized the importance of taking the time to interact with others in the field and the value of events such as Friday’s.
“This is kind of what makes the academic’s career—these intimate relationships where you get feedback on your work... your work gets workshopped, you get inspired,” she said.
The symposium draws on a class taught by Goldstein this semester, Folklore and Mythology 146: “Body Burdens: Toxic Tales and Politics of Environmental Racism," which focuses on both natural and social environments. According to Goldstein, interest in the class was so great that instructors had to create a second section—something unusual for the department. Several students from the class attended the symposium.
“[Goldstein] always envisioned this class as both the class and the symposium to complement one another,” attendee G. Miles Counts ’18 said.
Folklore and Mythology has hosted thematic conferences like Friday’s annually for over fifteen years. Last year’s event focused on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Folklore and Mythology concentration at the College.

UPDATED: April 10, 2018 at 9:00 p.m.
When Allison E. Hamilos took a neuroscience class during her second year of medical school, she had reason to be intimidated. Her classmates comprised both medical students and research-focused Ph.D. students.
For the medical students, Hamilos said, the class was “seen as [one of the] more challenging classes” in their curriculum.
But Hamilos loved it. One day, she went after class to talk to the professors.
“And they were like, ‘Oh, so you’re one of the Ph.D. students?,’” she recalled.
“No, no, I’m a med student,” she said. “And they’re like, ‘why?’”
After thinking more about that question, she said, she resolved to pursue a career in neuroscience research. Eventually, she decided to work toward a joint M.D.-Ph.D. earned at both the Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Hamilos is one of around 175 students currently enrolled in the University’s M.D.-Ph.D. program.
The dual degree is one of the University’s longest and most demanding programs and boasts an acceptance rate of 2 percent, allowing students to pursue doctorates in fields ranging from classics to chemistry while also completing clinical training. Enrollees say the ability to pursue vastly different disciplines, the close social connections forged through the M.D.-Ph.D. program, and later career benefits derived from holding two degrees render the challenging curriculum more than worth it.
While completing two advanced degrees in just eight years is not an easy task, the program is structured to ensure that students complete all of their requirements.
Once accepted, students in the joint program are enrolled in Harvard Medical School and are guaranteed admission to a doctoral program in their area of interest at either Harvard or MIT.
The National Institute of Health’s Medical Scientist Training Program has sponsored M.D.-Ph.D. training at Harvard and MIT since 1974. The combination of NIH and institutional funds provides a full scholarship to dual-degree students who earn admission to the MSTP program. Current Harvard medical students can also join the M.D.-Ph.D. program and may receive at least partial funding to help support their dual-degree training.
For the past several years, the program has been structured on what is known as a “two-four-two” timeline—students spend two years at the medical school, four years at the graduate program of their choice, and then return to complete their M.D.
Loren D. Walensky, who boasts an M.D.-Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins, has directed the joint program since 2013. He said the transitions in and out of medical school courses typically form the most challenging points for students.
“You have to do a lot of things to get ready to go back to med school: you have to get your papers in order to be able to be published, you have to write and defend your thesis,” Walensky said. “All the while, you have to start re-learning and re-preparing to enter the clinical world, where you’ll be side by side with students who have been doing it continuously, so you have to be able to get up to speed.”
Ann M. Morgan ’13, who is pursuing a medical degree and a doctorate in biophysics, also said switching back and forth between medical and graduate studies is one of the most difficult aspects of the program.
“Basically, every time you get good at what you’re doing, you stop doing it and do something else,” Morgan said. “Just as you’re getting comfortable with the vocabulary of medicine in med school, then you stop and you go to your Ph.D.”
Because challenges like these are inherent in the dual degree program, the admissions committee looks for a highly specific set of credentials, according to Walensky. He said successful applicants typically show both a “commitment to clinical training” and “accomplishments in science.”
“They can convey information clearly,” he said. “They have leadership capabilities that convey that they have balance, that they can kind of work hard and play hard, that they really have multi-dimensional personalities and talents.”
While the majority of students in the program pursue a Ph.D. in the sciences, applicants who want to pursue a Ph.D. in the social sciences must complete an additional writing sample as part of the initial process.
When these students graduate from their joint degree, they’ll join a contingent of physician-scientists that occupy positions at the highest levels of the medical field.
A number of prominent University and Medical School administrators hold both degrees. George Q. Daley ’82, dean of the medical school, David E. Golan, dean of basic science and graduate education, and Barrett J. Rollins, faculty dean of academic programs at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, have all earned M.D. and Ph.D. degrees. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 also holds both an M.D. and a Ph.D. in Economics.
Wolfram Goessling, co-director of the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, also holds an M.D.-Ph.D. He said it has helped bolster his research and administrative career.
“For me, to be able to get rigorous training in basic science—in parallel and in connection with medical training—has been helpful to hopefully be effective and efficient as a researcher,” Goessling said.
Walensky agreed that the clinical training graduates receive in medical school “really informs” their research.
“It gives them insight and qualifications that, in many ways, allows them to lead, because they know what’s going on in both spheres,” he said.
One further benefit to the program, according to some students, is its social element. M.D.-Ph.D. student Senan Ebrahim ’12, who is currently in his fifth year of the program, said that the rigors of the program allow students to bond.
“We got very close, because, in a way, what kind of nut-job would want to do this? We all have that vision for what our career is going to be like, that desire to help people in a particular way,” Ebrahim said.
Roughly 90 percent of M.D.-Ph.D. students in the joint program pursue graduate work in the sciences. But the other 10 percent—those that complete Ph.D.s in the social sciences or humanities—represent a growing portion of the program due to Walensky’s increased focus on funding interdisciplinary work.
In the past several years, an increase in both private and federal funding has allowed the program to double the number of admits interested in pursuing graduate work outside of the sciences, Walensky said. The most popular social science areas of study students pursue include medical anthropology, health policy, history of science, and economics.
Perhaps no student is a better example of this expansion than Katherine D. van Schaik ’08, who will graduate with her M.D. and a Ph.D. in Classics this year. Her dissertation focuses on “medical decision-making in Greco-Roman antiquity.”
To complete her thesis, van Schaik followed a path different from the typical M.D.-Ph.D. timeline. After two years each at medical and graduate school respectively, she returned for a third year of clinical work at the medical school. Most recently, she pursued research for her dissertation for three years and then completed a fourth year of medical school.
This spring, across less than two weeks, van Schaik will defend an honors thesis at the medical school and her dissertation at GSAS.
“I’m very grateful that Harvard has allowed me to pursue a combined course of study, which is not possible to do at many places,” van Schaik said. “The administration at GSAS and the Medical School allowed me to move back and forth between programs because I wanted a truly integrated course of study.”
Walensky said managing the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences tracks has been challenging during his time as director.
“One of the things we worked really hard on in the past couple of years is to streamline that,” he said. “So not only do our basic science students get accepted up front through one application process—now, nearly all social science students have the benefit of that as well.”
Walensky said van Schaik’s path typifies the broad academic possibilities available through Harvard's program.
“She’s broken down a lot of barriers, from radiology, to classics, to religion. She’s forged her own path, and she’s the poster child for what’s unique about Harvard,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council debated the design and execution of a new UC initiative that gives pairs of student groups hundreds of dollars to throw social events—but does not include a way to verify how groups use that money—at its meeting Sunday.
The grant, called the Matchmaker Collaboration Grant and established last December, randomly pairs two student organizations—selected by the UC treasurer from all organizations that apply via an online form—to host a social event. Selected duos receive $300 to throw one joint event.
Currently, the grant is administered solely by Council treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20, as mandated in the original legislation.
Multiple representatives at the meeting said they would like to establish a way to confirm grant recipients are not simply pocketing the UC’s money. The original legislation specified the UC would not ask for receipts from groups enrolled in the program, a stipulation that goes against the UC Finance Committee policy—applied to most other grants—that mandates grant beneficiaries submit receipts.
Khoury said at the meeting that five sets of student groups have received funding from the grant so far this semester, meaning the UC has allotted $1,500 through the program in total. But according to Khoury, no grant recipients have thrown social events to date.
“To my knowledge, none of them have happened,” Khoury said.
UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said after the meeting that the design and structure of the grant is meant to give groups more leeway in how they use Council money.
“We wanted this grant to be there for students to be able to throw social events and buy whatever it is they would like for those social events,” Boucher said.
During last year’s UC presidential campaign, Boucher and Council president Catherine L. Zhang ’19 listed the establishment of the matchmaker grant as a key plank of their campaign platform. Boucher said in December, shortly after he was elected vice president, that he hoped the grant would help compensate for what he called a lack of social opportunities on campus.
Boucher emphasized during Sunday’s meeting that, under the legislation establishing the matchmaker grant, the treasurer must follow up with student groups after the allocation of funding to ask whether the money was indeed used for a social event.
Khoury said Sunday she plans to send out a survey to this semester’s recipients.
Some Council members said they worry groups who fill out the survey may simply lie about how they used the money. Winthrop House Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 argued the structure of the grant leaves it ripe for abuse.
“If I were in a group and I just wanted to take my 150 bucks, I would just say, ‘Yeah, it went great!’ And, like, that would be good enough, right?” Bonsall said.  “It’s also an example of why we need to ask more questions and be more critical of legislation when it’s being proposed.”
Mather House Representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said he favors more oversight of the initiative as a whole.
“I highly recommend to the executive that a committee should be appointed to review how Matchmaker has gone this semester,” Gonzalez said.  “And that can be sort of the basis… to determine whether or not the Matchmaker grant should be renewed or if it should be changed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each of the past two seasons, Princeton knocked Harvard softball out of the Ivy League Championship Series. The teams’ regular season matchups in those years predicted the Crimson’s struggles, as the Tigers went a combined 3-1 with a plus-13 run differential.
In 2018, however, Harvard (13-11, 6-3 Ivy) completely bucked that trend. The Crimson swept Princeton (4-18, 2-4) in a three-game series this weekend, winning each contest by a comfortable margin. Harvard rebounded strongly from a difficult Cornell series, outscoring the Tigers, 26-9.
“We were able to walk away with three wins, which was nice especially after last weekend, playing Cornell when we weren’t as successful wins and losses-wise,” junior pitcher Katie Duncan said. “I think being able to make significant in-game improvements from last week to this week was huge.”
HARVARD 9, PRINCETON 3
In the bottom of the fourth of the weekend’s final game, a bunt from freshman Alyssa Saldana drove in a run to tie the game, 3-3. Saldana’s fielder’s choice left runners on second and third for Duncan, who occupied the circle for the first four innings. Duncan took a hack at a 1-0 pitch up in the zone, sending it high in the air to center. There, Princeton's’ Megan Donahey ran out of real estate on the warning track and watched Duncan’s blast land on the other side of the wall.
Before this season, Duncan had never made a plate appearance for the Crimson. In two games at the plate in 2018, the pitcher and occasional first baseman has launched two home runs.
“She’s been wanting to be able to hit for the last couple years that she’s been here,” junior shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “The team is really loving how she’s going up there and taking the biggest swing that she can, and she’s clearly getting the job done. We could not be happier for her.”
Duncan was just one part of the homer brigade in the final game of the weekend. Rich and junior second baseman Meagan Lantz also cleared the wall—Lantz knocked a ball well over the left-field wall near the scoreboard, while Rich laced a line drive that sailed over the fence in right.
Junior right-hander Sarah Smith picked up where she left off on Saturday afternoon. Coming on in relief of Duncan to start the top of the fifth, Smith hurled three more scoreless innings and picked up her first save of the season and the fifth of her career. Smith’s spotless weekend lowered her ERA to 2.76.
HARVARD 6, PRINCETON 3
In the closest game of the weekend, it was Harvard’s defense that provided the clutch performances. The Crimson turned three inning-ending double plays that were paramount in killing the Tigers’ rallies and preserving Harvard’s early lead.
In the top of the sixth, Princeton put together its most intense scoring threat of the contest. The Tigers led off the inning with singles from Kaitlyn Waslawski and Megan Donahey, who then executed a double steal to advance to second and third with no outs. After a sacrifice fly and an RBI single, however, the Crimson managed to slam the door on Princeton’s rally with a 4-6-3 double play.
Harvard had left the field in similar fashion twice before—in the fifth, left fielder Alexa Altchek made a sliding catch moving to her right and doubled up Hannah Lutz at second base, and Rich spun a double play of her own in the top of the first to strand a runner at third.
Making her fourth start in the circle this season, Smith cruised through four dominant innings in which she allowed just one Tiger to reach base. Junior third baseman Erin Lockhart, Lantz, and Altchek each had two-hit games. Lockhart drove in two runs, and Rich scored three of Harvard’s six.
“Sarah did amazing,” Duncan said. “She really stepped up this weekend and was a dominant force in the circle…. She’s been really efficient getting it done, which is awesome.”
HARVARD 11, PRINCETON 3 (5 INNINGS)
Through two and a half innings of Saturday’s opener, Princeton appeared to be in the driver’s seat. Tigers pitcher Allie Reynolds eliminated a first-inning rally and set down the Crimson’s hitters in order in the second. Meanwhile, the Princeton offense had tacked on three runs in the top of the second on an infield single and a double to left field.
However, Harvard came alive in the home half of the third and never looked back. The Crimson hung eight runs on the scoreboard in the bottom of the third and added on three more in its next trip to the plate for good measure.
Harvard’s third-inning rally relied on a mix of big hits and small ball, and Rich exhibited a bit of both. The junior was hit by a pitch to lead off the frame and promptly stole second, later coming around to score on two throwing errors. When she got her second chance to bat in the inning, Rich roped a triple onto the warning track in center field to drive in two runs.
“Our coach kept telling us at the end of the weekend how great it was that each person in the lineup was able to come through and help contribute to the team’s success,” Rich said. “The dugout fed off of that momentum and it just kept rolling.”
Duncan took the circle in Saturday’s opener, tossing five full frames and striking out four Tigers. After allowing three runs in the top of the second, Duncan buckled down and limited Princeton to just a base hit and a hit-by-pitch in the three subsequent innings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a flurry of races on the Charles River this past Saturday, the No. 16 Radcliffe heavyweight crew team, No. 2 Radcliffe lightweight crew team, and No. 2 Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team lined up for what was the first day of official competition since November for most rowers. While this weekend’s races marked the start of the spring dual season for the Radcliffe lightweight and men’s heavyweight teams, the Radcliffe heavyweight squad had raced the previous weekend, edging Michigan State and falling to Ohio State.
By the end of the day, men’s heavyweight crew comfortably bested both No. 10 Cornell and No. 15 George Washington in contests that were dictated by races won in no less than six seconds. The Radcliffe crews met different fates, however, with The Black and White heavyweight team falling to No. 8 Brown, and the lightweight crew falling to both No. 8 Georgetown and Bates.
MEN'S HEAVYWEIGHT CREW
The Crimson entered Saturday’s races after a rigorous winter training program. According to senior Dominic Glover, the team was excited to line up on the water to race.
“Definitely, the racing is what you’re there for,” Glover said. “The winter training is tough and it’s long, and a lot of it is indoors, but when you get out there to race, it’s the reason you’ve been putting in eight months of work, just to get out there alongside another school.”
If the team’s desire to race played any role in its performance, the rowers for Harvard must truly have been thrilled. In five races on the day, the Crimson blew past both its Big Red and Colonials opponents in dominating performances from the first to fifth varsity eight.
Harvard’s first varsity boat, stroked by junior Liam Corrigan, who was named to the All-Ivy League second team last year, clocked in in 6:04.686, more than 10 seconds in front of its Cornell counterpart and almost 15 seconds in front of George Washington. The second and third varsity boats also took victories by margins of victory of six and 12 seconds respectively.
“We have three freshman rowers and a freshman coxswain in the boat,” Glover said. “They brought a lot of energy, which was great, and we had a really strong start and got up early and put ourselves in a really strong position in the first thousand meters of the race. It was fairly tough conditions with a fairly strong crosswind, so we wanted to remain consistent and stay on our form through the finish of the race.”
WOMEN'S LIGHTWEIGHT CREW
The women’s lightweight crew, although ranked second in the nation, fell to both the Hoyas and Bobcats in three races on Saturday. In the first varsity race, Georgetown won in 7:04.716, a margin of victory of over 16 seconds over Radcliffe and 18 seconds over Bates, to secure the 2004 Cup.
WOMEN'S HEAVYWEIGHT CREW
On the heavyweight side, No. 8 Brown captured victories over the No. 16 Radcliffe rowers in all five races on Saturday.
“I think overall, the team was pretty pleased with our results,” Donnecke said. “Over the last four years, this is the first time we’ve finished in one of the earlier dual races against them with such a close margin. Three seconds for the 1V and the 2V, that’s a pretty easy margin that’s easy to make up over a couple of weeks.”
Just as Donnecke said, this weekend’s races, particularly the first and second varsity races, were decided by just three seconds each. The Bears took the first varsity race in 6:52.433 and the second varsity 6:58.575.
For the first varsity race, a miscommunication at the start gave Brown the early advantage.
“Brown got out a seat or two on the start, and we were fighting,” Donnecke said. “We were behind. They were barely in our vision the whole race, but we kept edging back into them, and then they’d take a bit, but then we edged back in, so it was a really hard fought race and it was cool to see how mentally tough we were throughout that.”
The Bears also took the 4VA, 4VB, and 3V races from the Black and White to complete the sweep. Donnecke said that the team has a strong training regiment to the future to shave off Brown’s slight margins of victory moving into championship season.
“I feel pretty optimistic and excited,” Donnecke said. “Usually, we come away from Brown feeling a bit down and because the margins are way bigger. We still didn’t win this weekend, but we were so close that we know it’s just a couple of technical changes, a couple of race plan fix ups, and then we’ll drop those seconds, so it’s exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s that time of year again—the 2018 Ivy League baseball slate is underway and the Ancient Eight is off and running.
This  weekend, the Harvard baseball team kicked off its conference games in New York, N.Y., against Columbia, a team that has had the Crimson’s number for the past decade. The Lions’ dominance of Harvard squads has remained constant despite the regular cycling-through of student-athletes.
The head-to-head record tells the whole story. Dating back to the 2008 spring season, the Crimson has locked horns with Columbia 20 times and lost 18 times, including an ugly 24-1 blowout in 2010. In fact, Harvard has been outscored 141-45 in those 18 losses. The going has been particularly rough when the Crimson is the away team, as Harvard is 0-10 in that stretch at Robertson Field at Satow Stadium.
If the fact that the Crimson has long struggled against its opponents from New York weighed on the players’ minds, it didn’t show as Harvard (9-13, 1-2 Ivy league) ignited its confidence with an 11-6 Ivy-opening victory against the Lions (7-18, 4-2) on Saturday afternoon. The Crimson couldn’t sustain the momentum, however, dropping 7-1 and 9-6 decisions on Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon.
A series win against Columbia will have to wait longer yet.
The players, however, took positives away. The self-dubbed Bad Boys of the Ivy League don’t get beaten down for long.
“We definitely gained some confidence out of the series,” said junior first baseman Pat McColl. “We’ve shown that we can definitely beat anyone. We’ve got a lot of confidence, and that’s what you need coming into these games, just the mentality that you’re going to win every game you play.”
Part of the confidence gained is in the fact that Saturday’s lone victory was Harvard’s first win visiting Columbia since 2007. The other part is in the fact that the team was within striking distance late in its two losses.
“Columbia’s definitely a good offensive team,” said junior center fielder Ben Skinner. “We were in most of the games, except for the second, and we were pretty competitive in the first and third game.”
The Lions are second in the Ivies with a .260 team BA, while the Crimson sits second-to-last at .243. In addition, the Harvard pitching staff now ranks dead last in the Ivies with a 7.43 overall ERA, while Columbia ranks second-to-last with a 7.30 ERA.
COLUMBIA 9, HARVARD 6
Down 6-1 in the third inning of the rubber match, Harvard conjured up a comeback powered by the usual suspects. Senior outfielder Austin Black, Skinner, sophomore outfielder Jake Suddleson, and McColl contributed RBIs to bring the scoreline back to a 6-6 tie in the top of the sixth.
With momentum on its side, the Crimson may have tasted a rare series victory in New York, but the Lions shut the door with a three-spot in the bottom of the sixth and a pitching clinic the rest of the way. Down by three, Harvard couldn’t get a single hit through the rest of the game, sealing its fate in a 9-6 loss.
“We got off to a little bit of a slow start, battled back and tied it, and then, in the end, just couldn’t quite come up with the hits we needed,” said McColl, who went 2-for-5 with an RBI.
On the mound, junior Kevin Stone got the start for the Crimson, lasting 1.1 innings while giving up six earned runs. Stone only gave up four hits while struggling with his command, hitting three Lion batsmen and walking one.
On the offensive side, Suddleson led the team by getting on base three times, driving in two, and drawing two walks. The rest of the Harvard offense never shifted into the next gear after tying the game, however, putting together just seven hits and leaving nine runners stranded.
COLUMBIA 7, HARVARD 1
Late Saturday afternoon, sophomore lefty Ben Wereski scattered seven Harvard hits over 7.1 innings pitched, senior righty Bryce Barr struck out four of the five Crimson hitters thereafter, and Columbia beat Harvard 7-1 to tie the series up at one apiece.
The Crimson pitching kept the deficit manageable for awhile, but the offense’s lack of run support was fatal.
Junior righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson pitched six innings, giving up five runs, one unearned, on eight hits, striking out four. Rosenblum-Larson, leading the team with nearly 11 K’s per nine innings, also walked a man and gave up a homer.
Suddleson and junior outfielder P.J. Robinson led the offense both with 2-for-3 days at the plate, but Robinson’s third-inning RBI single was all Harvard could muster.
Junior John MacLean, after making his collegiate pitching debut against Holy Cross, struck out both batters he faced in the seventh.
HARVARD 11, COLUMBIA 6
Crooked innings were the key to the Crimson’s 11-6 series-opening win over the Lions. Fresh off a 10-2 beatdown of Holy Cross earlier in the week, Harvard fueled its confidence with a four-run fourth inning and a five-run fifth inning to erase a 4-0 deficit, cruising to a comfortable win on Saturday afternoon.
All the facets of the game, all the ingredients for a winning recipe, were there—the Crimson garnered 15 hits and committed zero errors in the field. Senior righty Noah Zavolas went seven innings, striking out nine and walking none. Freshman two-way player Buddy Hayward, a top Ivy League rookie, pitched a strong relief effort, closing out the eighth and ninth innings without allowing a single baserunner.
Skinner and junior catcher Jake Allen got on base five times at the top of the order, while McColl and Suddleson drove in three runs in the 3-hole and cleanup role.
The middle of the order had a big game, as Black, sophomore third baseman Hunter Bigge, and Robinson, five through seven in the order, went a combined 7-for-14 and crossed the plate seven times. Bigge, in particular, went 3-for-4, while Robinson hit a rally-starting RBI double in the fourth and a two-run insurance bomb late.
Though Harvard wasn’t able to close out the series, the win was the Crimson’s first at Robertson Field at Satow Stadium in eleven years.
Harvard resumes play on Tuesday against Boston College at the 2018 Beanpot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say everything is bigger in Texas, and this week’s meet proved no different.
A high of 83 degrees Fahrenheit welcomed the Harvard track and field team deep into the heart of Texas this weekend as the teams competed against the nation’s top talent in the state’s capital, hosted by the University of Texas. The rest of the team dispersed across the nation with other athletes traveling to North Carolina and Northern Massachusetts.
TEXAS RELAYS
Team records fell left and right under the Austin sun over the course of the weekend with the men’s 4x400-meter relay team leading off and setting a new program record, twice, by placing fifth in the qualifying race and then sixth overall.
“The Texas Relays probably has the highest level of competition we will see all year,” senior Matt Hurst said. “It was really cool to be able to go into that type of environment and run fast against some of these big schools. I think we all just wanted to go down there and see how fast we could run, but to be able to break the school record while doing so just made it that much for exciting.”
At these highly competitive 91st Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays, the quartet—consisting of freshman Rodney Agyare-May, junior co-captain Myles Marshall, freshman Jovahn Williamson, and Hurst—broke the program record in the fourth heat of their event. Hitting the 3:09.38 time in the first race additionally propelled the group on to the finals.
“We knew we could run faster,” Agyare-May said. “It wasn’t the best race actually. We knew there was definitely still something left in the tank.”
In lane three, the group replicated the feat on Saturday earning sixth place in 3:08.57.
“We knew we had a good chance of running a fast time going in,” Agyare-May said. “We also knew it was going to be warm and that it was going to be a lot of competition because it was the Texas Meet and teams in Texas are generally pretty good. We had a pretty good idea of what we were capable of doing.”
In the 200-meter dash, junior co-captain Gabby Thomas did about as well as expected. “As well as expected” meaning she placed first overall (by nearly a second), broke her own program record, and clocked the sixth fastest NCAA all-conditions mark ever in the event after crossing the finish line in 22.13 seconds.
The Florence Flash hadn’t finished. The wind at her back, the junior clocked another program record in the 100-meter equivalent at 11.14. In the event’s final, Thomas did it again, hitting a 11.04 mark in the wind-aided third place finish.
Two sophomores claimed the 100-meter hurdles for the teams. Both setting top-10 program times in their efforts, classmates Livia Gauntlett and Karina Joiner finished 26th and 28th with times of 13.85 and 13.88 seconds, respectively.
Joiner then found a personal best in the 400-meter hurdles, claiming her top time in 59.72 seconds. She placed fifth on the all-time program list with that mark.
Also on the women’s half of the meet, junior Kathryn Gillespie found the leaderboard in the 1500-meter run among competition including the University of Texas, Georgia and Texas Christian University. Her 4:29.71 second time earned her seventh.
Marshall, prior to running the record breaking 4x400, broke the top six of the 800-meter runners on Thursday. His 1:50.85 second run was enough for sixth, but fourth among the collegiate athletes.
In the field, the Crimson struck silver twice. Sophomore triple jumper, Simi Fajemisin landed a new program record and placed first among college athletes in her event. Fajemisin flew 13.07 meters to earn her spot at the second step on the podium.
Freshman pole vaulter Erick Duffy found similar success in pole vault. Jumping on Thursday, the rookie hit the second-best mark in program history by clearing a 5.15-meter bar. The effort earned the first-year a silver medal, a feat he would repeat the following day at the Bobcat Invitation hosted by Texas State.
“Competing at two different meets in two days was new for me, but when my coach asked me if I wanted to vault again, I couldn’t turn it down,” Duffy said. “I am starting to become consistent again after having a less-than-ideal indoor season. I’m looking forward to the rest of this season. Big things are coming,both for me personally and our entire program.”
RALEIGH RELAYS
A squad of distance runners represented Harvard at the Raleigh Relays, hosted by NC State. In the day of running, sophomore Will Battershill in his first spring outdoor appearance earned himself a sixth place finish in the 3000-meter steeplechase. The second-year found the finish line 8:59.44 after the sound of the gun.
Freshmen led the day in the 5000-meter finals with classmates Abbe Goldstein and Hugo Milner landing 24th and 25th respectively. The two efforts were the best of the day for the runners from Cambridge.
UMASS LOWELL
On Saturday, athletes trekked north to the UMass-Lowell Invitational and left with official golds. Among the runners, senior Fiona Davis grabbed the gold among a field of 28 in the 3000-meter run. In the men’s variant, Louis Colson found similar success in a field of 31 at a 8:34.78-second pace. Also in long distance, freshman Matthew Pereira found the podium following a the 1500-meter, third place finish.
Another freshman, Lizzie Gummer claimed gold in the 400-meter hurdles while senior Annika Gompers managed second in the 800.
The field proved similarly successful for the athletes in crimson as the crew returned to campus with five medals in hand. Freshman Rachael Estell led the group with a gold medallion in triple jump. Junior Nicole Trenchard, typically a vaulter for the Crimson, grabbed a silver in the javelin throw in a 36.50-meter toss. In Hammer throw, Harvard took second and third as junior Allison Rabe and Martha Kebeh tossed the hammer 41.98 and 40.74 meters, respectively.
“I think that the men's team overall did okay,” men’s co-captain Jay Hebert said. “There were some highlights, but I think we learned what we need to do in order to get on the level of some of the top teams.”

Like every other Sunday night, you haven’t started your math pset that’s due tomorrow morning. And so, with a great sense of urgency, you brave the Math Question Center—with your pset buddies by your side, of course—and discover that there’s no better place to people-watch than MQC. If you’ve ever been to this institution of math help, you’ve met all of these people.
The Aggressive Section Kid
It should be a crime to take MQC as seriously as this person. In fact, everything about their presence should be illegal. Between loitering at the CA’s tables and harassing classmates for answers, they are always vandalizing chalkboards with proofs. (Math 55 doesn’t even go to MQC. Please relax.)
The Most Valuable Player
Despite possessing infinitely more wisdom than the aggressive section kid, you won’t find this person flexing on their peers. Instead, the MVP naturally swaggers into MQC to carry the incredible weight of their friends. The true or false section? Finished. The Mathematica portion? Ready to share on Google Docs. Unsurprisingly, the MVP beat Oliver Knill on Boss Mode.
The Bum
You can identify this person either by their famous words, “Wait, what pset are we on again?” or by their complete isolation—let it be known that literally no one wants to pset with them. Whatever the assignment, the bum is at least three lectures behind.
The "Collaborator"
Even by Harvard standards, this person is the ultimate opportunist. Often under the guise of verifying answers, this parasite will seek out new hosts for the freshest answers. Careful! They are even known to ask for pictures of your pset before you can make a clean escape.
The Course Assistant
When the CAs enter the room, clouds part and angels sing. They are the wind beneath your wings, the reason why you finished the pset in spite of their vocal opposition to checking answers. “She is the mother I never had, she is the sister everybody would want. She is the friend that everybody deserves. I don't know a better person.”—Oprah (We’re fairly convinced she was talking about a CA.)


As any STEM student can tell you, MQC strengthens and unites Harvard. And incidentally, attending MQC is much like enlisting in the army. Only through the rigorous training and shared trauma do you come out with lasting relationships. In twisted sort of way, you’ll find that MQC becomes a part of you.
