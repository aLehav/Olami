After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 25 years, Charles P. Slichter ’45–’46 served as a fellow on the Harvard Corporation while commuting back and forth from his post as a physics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Slichter flew from Urbana-Champaign to Chicago to Boston for the Corporation’s biweekly meetings—over 500 trips with no nonstop flights—to attend the gatherings of Harvard’s highest governing body.
“Most people would find it pretty wearing to do that, but Charlie had such enthusiasm for Harvard that I think he just loved being on the Corporation, even though he continued to be a busy professor at the University of Illinois,” said former University President Derek C. Bok.
Slichter is remembered by his children and colleagues for his contributions to the Corporation, his award-winning physics research, and his sense of humor, sage advice, love of people, and talent for teaching. He died on Feb. 19 at the age of 94.
Slichter was promoted to be a full professor at the University of Illinois in 1955, where he researched condensed matter physics and nuclear magnetic resonance. In 2007, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.
Described by Bok as something of a “Harvard brat,” Slichter was born in Ithaca, N.Y., the son of  Sumner H. Slichter, an Economics professor at Harvard. Slichter also received his Ph.D. from Harvard, and three of his six children graduated from the College.
Slichter served as the senior fellow on the Corporation for nearly 10 years and led the presidential search committee that selected Neil L. Rudenstine as University president in 1991. Harvard awarded Slichter an honorary degree in 1996 in recognition of his physics research and his service to the University on the Corporation.
“I knew his father because his father was a professor in the Economics Department when I was a student,” said Henry Rosovsky, professor emeritus of Economics at Harvard and a former colleague on the Corporation. “My sense was that Charlie was a much more informal man than his father was.”
Slichter’s son, Jacob H. Slichter ’83, also recalled his father’s warmth and kindness over his formality.
“When I was in college, and he was on the Corporation, and they’d meet twice a month, we’d have breakfast together. Whenever I would walk into the Faculty Club, he’d just give me these huge hugs,” Jacob Slichter said. “He didn't have the edge that so many others in that same room had, as they greeted their kids with firm handshakes and slaps on the back.”
Slichter’s kindness and love of people manifested itself in other ways, too. Jacob Slichter remembered in the days before smartphones, when trick-or-treaters came to Slichter’s door, he would snap a Polaroid of each of them in their costumes and put the photos in their bags along with their candy for their parents.
Another of his sons, Daniel H. Slichter ’04, said whenever he rode in a taxi cab with his father, his father would strike up an in-depth conversation with the driver.
“Everyone in life that he interacted with—it wasn't just if it was the Harvard President, it could be just somebody driving a cab from Logan into Cambridge—he wanted to have the same level of engagement and interaction with them as he would with anyone,” Daniel Slichter said.
Slichter friends and family said he was also known for his sense of humor. One of his favorite jokes, Daniel Slichter said, combined his playfulness with his love of math. When Slichter ordered martinis and they came filled halfway, he would tell the waiter or waitress that he only got one-eighth of a martini.
“If you take the cone shape of the martini glass, and you look at the volume of the cone, if it's half of the height, it's only an eighth of the volume. And so some poor waitstaff person would be like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m sorry!’” Daniel Slichter said, laughing. “He used this as a silly opportunity for a math lesson. That was the kind of thing that he would do.”
“He befriended more waitstaff and flight attendants than anybody I’ve ever met,” said David P. Slichter ’07, another of Slichter’s sons.
Daniel Slichter said that his father's love of research and love of teaching never came into conflict. A physicist himself, he said his father’s work in physics was innately collaborative, and key to this collaboration were both students and other researchers.
“My dad was someone who was renowned for his contributions as a scientist and as an experimentalist—but also just as a teacher,” Jacob Slichter said. “Whenever I would go down to the lab and see my dad, those students kind of regarded me as a younger brother, and that just told me how they thought about my dad.”
Physics appealed to Slichter because he loved problem-solving and thinking about science’s most fundamental questions. Jacob Slichter said when he was a child, his father would sit on the sofa after dinner with a yellow legal pad working through physics problems. Jacob Slichter would ask his father what he was doing, and one response remained with him through the years.
“His answer was, ‘We’re trying to understand, in the simplest terms, the nature of catalysis—the nature of chemical reactions,” Jacob Slichter said. “I remember even before I understood what all of that meant, I was struck by the elegance and depth of what he had said, and saw in him that he absolutely felt all of it.”
Rosovsky said in the early 1980s, he wanted Slichter to come to Harvard as a faculty member, but Slichter ultimately turned down the offer because he wanted a teaching, rather than administrative, role.
“I tried very hard to bring him to Harvard as a faculty member, as the dean of what was then called the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which is now called SEAS,” Rosovsky said. “He decided not to come and he stayed in Illinois.”
Bok said Slichter provided unique insights to the Corporation’s discussions, especially as Harvard changed its science focus from theoretical science to applied science.
“The decision to actually create a School of Engineering did not take place until a few years after I left, but the beginnings of it owed a lot to the insights of Charlie Slichter,” Bok said.
According to his children, one aspect of Slichter that influenced every aspect of his life—be it his work on the Corporation, his physics research, or his relationships with his family—was his unbridled enthusiasm.
“He could be overcome with enthusiasm for things, beyond his ability to express with words sometimes. And that could be physics, it could be his kids, it could be Harvard, which he really loved,” David Slichter said. “But it could also be something like a Marx brothers movie, or a Bob and Ray sketch.”
Jacob Slichter remembered this same characteristic of his father, explaining how it stayed with him even in his last days.
“He was a big enthusiast for life. He loved Dixieland jazz, marching bands, circus trains, fireworks—all that kind of stuff could light up his eyes just as much as physics did,” Jacob  Slichter said. “And even in death, he was just always shining on everybody around him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—After struggling to find the bottom of the net for the first 15 minutes of game action on Saturday afternoon, the Harvard men’s basketball team pulled away from Cornell, 74-55, in the day’s first Ivy League Tournament semifinal. Sophomore forward Seth Towns led all scorers with 24 points while classmates Christian Juzang and Chris Lewis combined for 28 on 11-of-19 shooting.
The victory gives the Crimson a spot in Sunday afternoon’s Ivy League Tournament championship, to be played at the Palestra at noon. After holding a lead that grew to as many as seven in the first half, the Big Red (12-16) had no answer for Harvard (18-12), which stormed back for its largest win of the season.
“We’ve had some tough games with Cornell and give them so much credit for how their team plays," Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought the difference was our ability to get on the backboard. One of the things we preach and talk about so much in our program through the years is our bench and our balance, I thought those were two big keys for us to push this thing through.”
RUNNING AWAY
The Crimson struggled mightily in the game’s first 15 minutes, relying on Towns for much of its offense while several of its key players struggled with foul trouble. Despite the shooting woes, Harvard flipped the script before intermission and never looked back. Two runs were largely the difference for the top seed on Saturday afternoon.
The first, a 16-4 stretch to end the opening half, was punctuated by a Juzang halfcourt shot to beat the buzzer. Harvard held Cornell to just two field goals over the last five minutes and made four of its final six shot attempts, including its last four three-pointers before the break.
“We talk about the momentum,” Amaker said. “I think that allowed us to put an exclamation point on a 14-4 run and that shot, it hurts if you’re on the other side, and we’ve been on the other side….I thought our kids were able to catch a little excitement and run with it.”
Despite the run, it was relatively remarkable that the Crimson entered the locker room with the lead. Harvard made just seven of its first 22 field goal attempts and committed seven personal fouls in the game’s first 10 minutes.
While the first stretch gave the Crimson a cushion heading into the break, the second run allowed Harvard to bury the fourth-seeded Big Red. This time around, the run was an 18-3 outburst that spanned for eight minutes down the stretch. The Crimson shot 6-of-10 overall, making two three-pointers and getting eight points from Towns.
“It’s a tremendous comfort to know [Towns is] a tremendous offensive player,” Amaker said. “He’s versatile, I think that’s the key, that he gives us versatility. We refer to him as our most important player because of his versatility. We can move him around, he gives us inside production, he’s a terrific three point shooter, a dynamite foul shooter.”
LOCKING IN DEFENSIVELY
Since Amaker took over as head coach in 2007, Harvard has prided itself on defense. The Crimson led the Ivy League in opponents’ points per game during the regular season and was able to slow down Cornell for most of the afternoon on Saturday.
Juniors Stone Gettings and Matt Morgan had torched Harvard in the teams’ two meetings earlier this season. Gettings went for 32 points in Ithaca while Morgan finished with 34 last weekend in Cambridge. This time around, the Crimson was particularly successful in frustrating Gettings while holding Morgan to just 11 shot attempts, more than four fewer than his season average.
“[Gettings] knows how to play on the perimeter and inside,” Lewis said. “He’s very patient. He has a complete game and it takes the whole team to play him in a sense because you know he’s a good passer, you know he can play without the ball [or] with the ball.
Forcing Gettings into tough shots and denying Morgan the basketball made life miserable for Cornell coach Brian Earl and his role players. The Big Red only made eight field goals after intermission and shot 38 percent from the field. After Morgan scored seven of Cornell’s first nine points in the second half’s first five minutes to get his team back within five points, the Big Red would only manage 14 points in the game’s final 15 minutes.
“That was our emphasis in practice, guard people off the ball,” Towns said. “You know that’s [Morgan’s] bread and butter, to move off the ball and score, and he’s really good at it so we definitely practiced that.”
Perhaps most impressively, Harvard was able to hold Cornell to just two field goals in the final 13 minutes of game action, forcing the Big Red into misses on eight of its final 10 shot attempts. The cold stretch was a more extreme version of how Cornell ended the first half—the Big Red made just two field goals over the first frame’s final five minutes.
“I think our communication is a big key being away from our bench,” Juzang said. “Even in practice, a thing coach puts us through is being away from our bench when we do our defensive stuff. So we picked up our communication most definitely and we talked about at halftime how that’s going to win us the games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—In a nail-biting defensive battle that came down to the final seconds, Harvard women’s basketball fell to Penn in the Palestra on the Quakers (22-7, 12-3 Ivy) home court. The Crimson (18-10, 10-5) shot only 25.8 percent to Penn’s 33.3 percent from the field in a night where shots seemed not to fall for either side.
“It’s very uncharacteristic for all of my scorers to have such an off shooting night,” Delaney-Smith said. “Although, I thought we got the shots we wanted.”
The tight game would come down to the end, as neither team led by more than seven points at any point throughout the game.
With just under three minutes to go in the contest, sophomore guard Sydney Skinner knocked down a three from the corner to cut the Quakers’ lead at 51-48. On the ensuing possession, Skinner’s attempt at a game-tying triple was off the mark, however sophomore guard Katie Benzan snagged the rebound and dribbled out for a step-back three of her own. Benzan drilled the shot to tie the game.
Less than 20 seconds later, however, Penn would answer with its own three-pointer to take the lead back, 54-51. The Quakers would not relinquish the lead for the rest of the game.
“I’m very proud of my team for how hard they played,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They put themselves in a position to win it at the end, and shots did not fall.”

Benzan would get two contested looks from beyond the arc with a chance to tie the game, but neither fell. Following a Harvard foul, Skinner poked the ball away and ended up on the hardwood with a Penn player to give the Crimson possession again. Skinner took a contested step-back three on Harvard’s next possession, but it was unable to fall. The Quakers then iced the game with their subsequent free-throws.
Although the Crimson struggled to find its rhythm from the field, its success from behind the arc kept it in the game offensively. Benzan took control of the game coming out of halftime with her shot from downtown. Benzan started off the third quarter with a deep three-pointer from the left wing, then immediately knocked down another triple from even farther behind the three-point line. Benzan stayed on fire on the next possession, drilling a three-pointer from another zip code.
She continued to ignite Harvard, tying up Penn for a jump ball on the defensive end for her fourth tie-up of the game.
“I was just hungry, and I had a mindset that we weren’t going to lose that game,” Benzan said.
For the remainder of the game, the Quakers focused on taking Benzan out of the game. Penn  transitioned to face-up defense on Benzan, zoning in on taking her three-point shot out of the game.
“Katie’s one of the best shooters in the country,” Delaney-Smith said. “What we have to do to get her her shot, she has to run through hoops, so I think with that goes no legs.”
Benzan was unable to free herself from the Quakers’ smothering defense, being held scoreless until she knocked down two free-throws to tie the game at 34. Penn would retake the lead 37-35 heading into the final period.
The offensive explosion of the third quarter was a stark contrast from the first half of play.
The two teams started the defensive slugfest with a slow first quarter. Benzan kicked the game off with a quick three-pointer off the dribble from the left wing, but the offenses stalled from here. At the first media timeout with 4:12 to play in the first period, the score was 5-2. The Crimson was shooting only 20 percent from the field, while the Quakers’ only points were thanks to free-throws.
“The first quarter I thought we were not getting into our system at all, I thought we were a little frenetic, hence the turnovers,” Delaney-Smith said.

Following a Boehm block, senior guard Taylor Rooks raced off into transition. After missing her original layup, Rooks grabbed her own rebound and put it back up, converting on the layup and the ensuing free-throw for an old-fashioned three-point play.
Penn’s first field goal did not come until over seven minutes into the game, but the Quakers would turn on the heat defensively to supply their offense at the end of the period. Penn forced two Harvard turnovers that led to four points, tying the game 8-8 before the end of the quarter. The offenses struggled in the opening frame, with the Crimson shooting 15.8 percent and the Quakers shooting only 13.3 percent from the field.
“We kept believing that the shots were going to fall,” Benzan said. “They did and they didn’t.”
After a back-and-forth second quarter that saw Penn edge Harvard to take the lead 23-18 at the half, the Quakers’ offense would come alive later on in the game when it mattered most. Junior co-captain Madeline Raster drilled a floater from the free-throw line to make the game 41-39, causing Penn to call a timeout. The Quakers used the timeout to swing the momentum back in their favor. Penn went go on a quick 7-0 run, but would call a timeout, effectively halting its momentum and leading to the Crimson’s comeback attempt at the end of the game.
“We talk a lot about that in practice, being able to play with the ebbs and flows of the game,” Skinner said. “That’s basketball, there’s ups and downs you’ve got to be able to play through it. That’s one thing Kathy has always told us, we have to be able to play regardless if we’re up or if we’re down.”
Although the Quaker “twin towers” of senior forward Michelle Nwokedi and freshman center Eleah Parker have dominated the paint in the Ivy League this season, Harvard was able to outrebound Penn 48-45. Rooks recorded a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds, and sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm matched Nwokedi, with each big scoring eight points and grabbing 14 rebounds.
“Penn did a great job inside, they made an adjustment from when we played up in Boston,” Delaney-Smith said. “Those bigs are the best in the league in my opinion… I’m proud of Jeannie, I think Jeannie has grown enormously for us this year, and I thought Jeannie had a tremendous game.”
The close battle between the stifling defenses kept the contest close throughout. The game was tied nine separate times, and there were seven lead changes. Ultimately, the Quakers’ burst of offensive energy on its home court was enough to propel Penn past Harvard and move on to play in the Ivy League championship Sunday, ending the Crimson’s season.
“I thought my kids played really hard,” Delaney-Smith said. “They took the shots I wanted them to take, and they didn’t fall.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—Two last second three-point attempts came up short as the Harvard men’s basketball team fell to second-seeded Penn, 68-65,in Sunday’s Ivy League Tournament championship game. Sophomore wing Justin Bassey’s deep triple from straight away was wide left. After freshman guard Mario Haskett corralled the offensive rebound, sophomore point guard Christian Juzang heaved an airball from the left corner.
“I knew I wanted to get a quicker shot up to to give us a chance to offensive rebound and possibly get a second look,” Bassey said. “Just didn’t knock down the shot pretty much. Rio had a great offensive rebound, we had another good look in the corner from Juzang, just didn’t fall.”
Seconds after the final horn sounded, the Penn (24-8) faithful was storming the floor of the Palestra in celebration of the Quakers’ first NCAA Tournament berth since 2007.
“I thought they deserved it and we played our hearts out to give it the best effort we could give and came up a little bit short,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m certainly proud of our team for the fight they put out throughout this season.”
After a frantic Harvard (18-13) comeback that lasted for much of the second half, Penn senior Caleb Wood knocked down a deep three to quell a 15-2 Crimson run and tie the game with 4:21 to play. Wood capped off a stretch of eight straight points for the Quakers by hitting another triple and putting his team up three as the clock read 3:42.
The lead was six with under a minute to play after an extended scoreless stretch from Harvard. After junior guard Corey Johnson took a charge on Penn junior Max Rothschild, Juzang drilled a three with 47.6 seconds to play to make it a one-possession game once more.
The fact that the Crimson stood a chance in the game’s final minutes was remarkable in itself.
The Quakers went into the locker room at halftime leading by two after senior guard Darnell Foreman nailed a buzzer-beating three. It was a fitting end to a record-setting half for the fourth-year. Foreman was unstoppable before the break, making six of his first seven field goal attempts en route to 19 points, the most by any player in a half in Ivy League Tournament history.
“Foreman’s a great player, he’s going to make tough shots,” Bassey said. “We talked about regrouping and responding at halftime and really coming together and making our run. They had a great run to end the half. We, at halftime, came together and really focused on how we can end their run and get a run of our own going.”
The Camden, N.J., native, playing in his final game at the Palestra, came into the half like a lion and went out of it like a lion. He was largely the only reason that Penn was still in the game after Harvard went on a 16-0 run to take a 13-point lead late in the first half. Foreman scored 11 of the Quakers’ first 13 points as the Crimson tried to pull away and then notched two more three-pointers to help spark a 13-0 burst from his own team to end the half.

“They’re a great team,” sophomore forward Chris Lewis said. “They stayed composed once we got a lead, they were patient when they got the ball, and they played their offense like their coach drilled into them. They went on a run, we went on a run, it was a game of spurts, and that’s just how it played out.”
Despite the 15-minute break for halftime, Penn did not take its foot off the gas after it emerged from the locker room. The 13-0 run snowballed into 11 straight points for the Quakers before the second frame’s first media timeout. Penn could not miss, making its first five second half field goal attempts, while Harvard could not buy a basket.
The Crimson went without a field goal for a nine-minute stretch that spanned both halves.
Sophomores Ryan Betley and AJ Brodeur helped Foreman dig Harvard’s hole. The trio combined for 45 of Penn’s first 48 points, and the Quakers were still shooting over 50 percent for the game with 12 minutes to play. Just when it looked like Penn was going to run away with its 24th trip to the NCAA Tournament, the Crimson began chipping away.
Much like it did during its 16-0 run in the first half, Harvard locked down defensively and its offense followed suit. After sophomore forward Seth Towns scored seven of the Crimson’s first nine points out of the break, classmate Chris Lewis took over, scoring six straight for Harvard to get his team back within eight.
“We stayed composed, we knew we we’re going to get some shots up,” Lewis said. “We knew as long we kept on staying composed, staying efficient, we were going to get on a run too. That’s just how we had to stay in the game, trusting each other, being tight, moving the ball.
As it looked like things were going the Crimson’s way, Towns went down with a knee injury that sidelined him for the final 8:20 of game action. At the beginning of the year, few people would have imagined that a rotation featuring freshmen Danilo Djuricic and Mario Haskett and Juzang—who played just 93 minutes a season ago—would be on the floor at the Ivy League Tournament. Even fewer would have predicted the gutsy stretch from that group that allowed Harvard to stay in the game over the final stretch.
“It’s obviously difficult, but we did it,” Amaker said. “We didn’t have [Towns] and we fought back and took the lead and still had the opportunity to win the game or to tie it to force overtime. He’s as good as he is and we know how good of a player he is for us...it certainly wasn’t easy.”
After Towns went down, Bassey went on a personal 6-0 run. The Denver, Colo., native made a three-pointer, corralled a loose ball on the other end, took it the length of the floor, and laid it in. The ensuing free throw got the Crimson within two and a pair of free throws from Juzang tied the contest for the first time since the teams were knotted at two. Harvard’s lead mushroomed to three but a scoreless stretch that lasted nearly four minutes allowed the Quakers to claw back to take the late win.
It was the second year in a row that the Crimson walked off the floor of the Palestra in dejection after falling short in the Ivy League Tournament. Harvard fell to Yale in the semifinals of last season’s tournament.
“I mentioned to them that I understand it, I’ve been there before, I’ve been in that seat before where they were sitting...to come up short in a big moment,” Amaker said. “I told them I feel for them and I understand, but we need to get our heads up and get our heads right and we’re hopeful that we’ll have a chance to continue to play this year in postseason.”
The NCAA Tournament appearance will be the fourth for Donahue. Penn completed a perfect season against conference opponents at the Palestra and has won 20 of its last 25 Ivy League games dating back to last season. The Quakers’ opponent will be announced at 6:00 tonight while the Crimson will find out its NIT matchup at 8:00.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Big players shine in big moments.
Harvard junior forward Ryan Donato has scored 26 goals this season, but none were more crucial to the Harvard men’s hockey team than the trio of tallies he logged on Sunday evening.
The Crimson (15-13-4, 11-8-3 ECAC) skated by Dartmouth, 4-2, in game three of the ECAC quarterfinals. The team now advances to face No. 10/8 Clarkson in the semifinal round, hosted in Lake Placid, N.Y.
“They were very well-prepared,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought they played super competitive. When you play in the playoffs, you have to elevate your game. And they made us elevate our game.”
The victory marks the Crimson’s fourth straight trip to Herb Brooks Arena. In 2015 and 2017, the squad took home the conference crown, and in between those triumphs, it finished second to eventual national runner-up, Quinnipiac.
“I mentioned it to our seniors after the game to congratulate them for making Lake Placid four years [in a row],” coach Donato said. “It’s tough to get back to Lake Placid, and I think we certainly got off to a tough start [this season], and we’ve had some ups and downs, but…to get to Lake Placid is pretty special.”
After falling to the Big Green (16-17-2, 11-10-1) in game one of the series, the home team rallied to nab two consecutive tilts en route to ending the Ivy League rival’s playoff run.
Prior to the season-saving performances, Harvard found itself in a strange position: its back was up against the wall to a team it normally handles with relative ease. Coach Donato’s squad outscored Dartmouth, 9-1, across two contests in the regular season and had prevailed seven of the last nine meetings between the teams leading up to this year’s playoff matchup.
Ultimately, the Crimson’s superior star-power willed the team to the next round. In addition to Donato’s seven points (4–3—7) in the pair of wins this weekend, sophomore blue-liner Adam Fox, another offensive workhorse for Harvard, registered six (3–3—6).
“On Saturday and Sunday, [Donato] elevated his game, and that helped elevate our team,” coach Donato lauded. “Fox, I would say the same thing. Those are our best players, and important games need your best players to be the best players. I thought both those guys absolutely did that.”
Not only does the series victory preserve the 2017-2018 campaign; it also keeps Donato in the crimson and white, rather than the yellow and black. The Boston Bruins, owners of the junior’s draft rights, are simply counting down the days until Donato joins the NHL club for a potentially fruitful playoff run.
Though not a guarantee, Donato’s departure from Harvard and its hockey program seems imminent after impressive performances for both his college and his country in February’s Pyeongchang Olympics.
The Scituate, Mass., native’s skill was certainly on display Sunday night. To complete his hat trick, Donato split two Big Green defensemen by flicking the puck up over their sticks upon entering the offensive zone. He corralled the puck, which was swatted even higher into the air by Dartmouth alternate captain Tim Shoup, lost a glove in the process, and punched home his own rebound.
“I just saw a little space in between the two defenders,” Donato recalled. “All of a sudden I realized my glove was off. I didn’t even feel it go off, [I] just gripped the stick a little cold, and I go, ‘Oh.’ And I brought it to my backhand, I couldn’t get it up, and then I just tried to bring it back to my forehand and...thankfully it went in.”
With his third hat-trick performance of the campaign, Donato pocketed at least a point in all five clashes with the Big Green this year. The centerman also regained possession of the NCAA lead in goals per game.
“[Ryan] takes hockey very seriously. He prepares more than anybody,” tri-captain Merrick Madsen said. “Since I had shots from Jimmy [Vesey ’16, Hobey Baker winner], he’s the closest thing to being able to just pinpoint pucks and put them in the craziest of places…. I guess I’m just thankful that I’m on the side that I am.”
The game wasn’t all glitz and glamour, though. In fact, the first period contained a truly strange play. Dartmouth sophomore Shane Sellar put a seemingly harmless backhand shot on net, but the puck bounced up on Madsen. The flailing goaltender did make the save, albeit an unconventional one. Madsen was forced to pin the puck against the post using his back pads, only to let it fall to the ice after the referees whistled play to a halt.
“[Sellar] missed the net, and it kind of hit the side of the net, and it popped up, and I felt it on my shoulder,” Madsen explained. “I kind of just twisted my back and…put everything I could up against the post, and apparently, the puck was stuck in between me and the post. I didn’t know where it was, but I was scared if I even moved at all that it would go in.”
While Donato’s offensive outburst eventually stole the game for the Crimson, it was the visitors who jumped out to the early advantage. Freshman forward Collin Rutherford drew first blood just five minutes after puck drop.
Alternate captain Corey Kalk threw a puck toward the net mouth, where a crashing Rutherford whacked at it multiple times before batting it past Madsen.
Madsen, who started all three games for Harvard this series, appears to be coach Donato’s goalie of choice after a season of uncertainty between the pipes. The senior helped the squad all the way to the Frozen Four last year and did his part this weekend (2-1-0, 2.05 GAA, .906 SV%) in ensuring his tenure as a Crimson backstop persisted.
If Harvard wants to continue its ECAC playoff run—with a title being essentially its only hope of reaching the NCAA Tournament—Madsen’s play and a general sense of stability in the cage will be paramount. Looking ahead to the semifinals, the Crimson’s matchup sends the net-minder mixed signals.
On one hand, the teams’ most recent showdown saw Harvard upset the then-No. 2 Golden Knights thanks to big-time play from Madsen (2.00 GAA, .929 SV%). On the other, a late-January meeting between the two squads represented one of Madsen’s major setbacks this season (6.12 GAA, .800 SV%). That game, the tri-captain earned the hook from coach Donato after ceding a game-changing goal from beyond the blue line.
As long as the Acton, Calif., product gives his team a chance to win, however, expect him to continue to field pucks for Harvard. And Madsen did just that this weekend despite what a .906 weekend save percentage—pedestrian on paper—might indicate.
Entering the series, the Big Green was riding the offensive renaissance of sophomores Will Graber and Sellar and freshman Quin Foreman. Thanks in part to timely saves from Madsen, the three key players combined for just a single point all weekend after totaling six against St. Lawrence in the first round.
Madsen also played a role in stymying a late-game push from Dartmouth, who mustered just one more score before the final horn sounded.
“They’re looking at the end of their season there,” said Madsen. “They’re going to just throw everything at us that they can. We had a lot of guys step up and block a lot of shots, which was humongous.”
Despite a storied Ivy rivalry between the teams, this weekend marks the first-ever Crimson victory over the Big Green in a best-of-three setting. Harvard, after all, has played just two other game threes against its Hanover, N.H., counterpart (2011 and 2013) and now owns an 8-5 all-time record against Dartmouth in ECAC playoff play.
The series win concludes the Crimson’s campaign at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The program’s seven seniors will never again lace up their skates in Harvard’s home building.
