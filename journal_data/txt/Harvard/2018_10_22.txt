After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Wednesday, Harvard presented the inaugural Mahindra Award for Global Distinction in the Humanities to the eminent novelist J. M. Coetzee. In doing so, it had a chance to show the Harvard community and wider world why the humanities matter. It failed, offering a slapdash ceremony that instead trivialized literature, philosophy, history, music, and art, confirming instead of rebutting misguided pronouncements of the humanities’ continued slide into irrelevance.
The Mahindra Award “celebrates the work and vision of an internationally renowned public figure whose career has contributed significantly to the flourishing of the arts and humanities.” It is meant to “provide an opportunity to give wide visibility to various aspects of the humanities, not only as a group of academic disciplines but as a form of public service.” Coetzee was an excellent choice for the inaugural award, to add to his Nobel, two Bookers, and countless others. In novels like “Waiting for the Barbarians,” “Life and Times of Michael K,” and “Elizabeth Costello,” he has given the world serious, disturbing, and lasting meditations on human pathos and intellect, dignity and indignity. One cannot imagine any better recipient, only a better and more fitting ceremony.
Homi K. Bhabha, Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center and master of ceremonies for the evening, introduced Coetzee by holding forth grandiosely and at great length, indeed seemingly for longer than Coetzee himself. If one actually listened to Bhabha — perhaps one isn’t supposed to do this at awards ceremonies — it quickly became apparent that he wasn’t really saying anything at all. Sadly, this was far from the low point of the evening.
After University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s presentation of the award, Coetzee gave an oblique acceptance speech. Then Bhabha noted that he had “playfully” asked Coetzee to name three of his favorite things, and the majority of the evening was handed over to a rambling, associative discussion between eleven intellectuals, from Harvard and beyond, of bicycles, Bach, and Roget’s Thesaurus. This half-scripted, half-extemporaneous group discussion quickly become so farcical that Jamaica Kincaid prefaced her comments by openly complaining that she had begged Bhabha to let her skip the event, before riffing on her hatred of the thesaurus and drawing the evening’s most enthusiastic response from the crowd. Robert B. Pippin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago and Coetzee’s former colleague on the Committee on Social Thought there, was flown in for the evening to say all of two-dozen words. One was left wondering what connection, if any, other of the panelists had to Coetzee or his work, and how many thousands of dollars, ever harder to find for the humanities, had been spent on the proceedings.
As my companion for the evening put it, it was like overhearing a dinner party conversation, of interest not in itself, but only if one were already invested in the guests. To put it more bluntly: The format of the evening reduced the learning and eloquence of Stephen J. Greenblatt, Elaine Scarry, and the rest of its distinguished panelists to mere conversational fodder. I was left to imagine what one of my first-year students, if in the audience, would have thought: Is this all that the humanities is for? Making clever connections between Bach and bicycles in a desperate attempt to impress? To pass time? Why not let the panelists actually talk with substance about the work of the writer we were there to celebrate?
Only 15 percent of Harvard’s most recently graduated class reported concentrating in the humanities. A similarly small percentage of the newest class intends to concentrate there. Strikingly, Harvard does not break down this data according to the traditional triad of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Instead, it separates the biological sciences, physical sciences, engineering, computer science, and math all apart into their own categories, so that it can pretend that Harvard College remains a balanced liberal arts institution, instead of one increasingly dominated by empirical and quantitative fields and careerist anxieties. The Mahindra ceremony, intended to give visibility to the humanities, certainly gave students no reason to think this trend away from the humanities is troubling.
Award ceremonies are not academic conferences, and one shouldn’t attend them expecting to hear papers of rigorous interpretation and argument. But why did the University dedicate an hour of the ceremony to what was essentially a joke? Why not choose two or three speakers engaged both intellectually and personally with Coetzee and allow them to do what critics, historians, and philosophers can: open up Coetzee’s work for the audience and wider world, showing them why it matters, why the humanities matter, why the humanities still matter?
I imagine that Coetzee enjoyed Stephen Prutsman’s performances of Bach, but otherwise found the proceedings ridiculous, beneath his own famous and well earned moral seriousness. One wouldn’t be surprised if he came away from the evening with an altogether lower opinion of our institution.
Harvard can do better: for the humanities, and for the next person in Coetzee’s place. Let us hope, in two years when the Mahindra Award is handed out again, it does.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, I finally registered to vote. It was anticlimactic, though, and not just because I had to wait until the envelope with my registration forms reached my county’s board of elections. It was anticlimactic because I had no real excitement about the process.
That lack of momentousness was weird, because it should be exciting to become a voter — especially a young voter — right now. We might be the key demographic in the 2018 midterms, and it does seem like we are excited. Here at Harvard, “young people have been really excited about this upcoming election,” as one student put it. Around the country, “Young voters [are] energized for midterms,” as a Tufts survey announces. Consequently, “young voters will decide the 2018 elections” and “have the ‘potential to change politics,’” as many headlines maintain.
The caveat being, of course, “if they actually vote.”
Thus, people are trying to make voting even more exciting. Here at the College, the Harvard-Yale Votes Challenge taps into our deepest rivalry because “it would be exciting to challenge each other to increase our voter participation rates.” Elsewhere, the nonprofit Chicago Votes hosted “Give a Shit Weekend” — a bluntly named event designed to “get young people excited about election season.” The most ambitious initiative might be comedian Billy Eichner and comedy website Funny Or Die’s “Glam Up the Midterms” tour — it wants to get young people to think of the elections as the “sexiest event of the year.”
Perhaps the most effective burst of excitement has come from, of all places, Taylor Swift. She broke her long political silence to encourage people to vote, and people actually did. The site to which she linked, vote.org, reported a “massive surge” in registrations of young voters, who make up the majority of her fan demographic.
For all the noise, though, Swift’s actual post was reasonable and uncontroversial. She simply stated whom she was going to vote for and why, but she didn’t compel anyone to vote the same way. To anyone who looked at her Instagram, all she asked you to do was: “educate yourself,” “register,” and “vote based on who most closely represents your values.”
It is funny that this message was the one that broke through. To me, it showed the silliness of us young people waiting for jolts of excitement, like a celebrity endorsement, to spur us to register. Swift added her sheen of celebrity to a mundane act, but she was also highlighting how mundane the act is.
Voting is not very exciting. There may be a few interesting swing districts or states, in which the act of voting for a revolutionary candidate would truly be exciting. But most of us cannot participate in those races. For most of us who live in places that lean one way or another, race outcomes are essentially predetermined, and the act of voting itself does not matter much. I confess that I simply expect the gears of democracy to keep turning, regardless of my own civic participation — elections will be held, voters will vote, losers will give up power, and winners will rise in their place.
This is not to say that voting is stupid — on the contrary. Voting may feel mundane, but that voting can feel mundane is the real privilege. People had to fight for this right hundreds of years ago. Women had to fight just a hundred years ago. It is shortsighted and selfish of us not to vote, holding out for something as fickle as excitement.
So voting is not overhyped, but excitement is. I love that there are so many initiatives trying to get young people excited to vote. I hope that they make the difference in the upcoming midterms. But I worry that they will not address the deeper dysfunction in our civic culture, manifested in consistently low voter participation rates and frantic action taken only after the crises of democracy that we have seen since the last election.
Don’t let us young voters off the hook. Don’t settle for the scenario in which young voters vote just because we think that it will be exciting or sexy. Even if we swing the 2018 midterms, there are deeper problems with our mindsets around voting. Because voting will not always feel exciting, and because voting is not really that exciting — but that is all the more reason we must do it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, federal court proceedings in the Students for Fair Admissions-led lawsuit against Harvard revealed that the College has an entrenched preference for the children of wealthy donors. We do not find these new developments particularly surprising. This preference, perhaps designed to help keep Harvard financially afloat, has long been an open secret. However, as unsurprising as these revelations are, we still find them unacceptable.
While we are hardly shocked by the confirmation that Harvard tips the scales of its admissions in favor of the children of prolific donors, we are still discomfited by the incongruity of this potential quid-pro quo with the mission of this college — for the same reason we have many times called for the elimination of legacy preference in the College’s admissions. Indeed, Harvard’s preference for both legacy students and children of wealthy donors has thrown the College’s purportedly holistic admissions standards into serious question, and stands out as deeply incompatible with its mission.
The College states that its mission to seek out and build promising students across the globe who show the promise and skill to become leaders in our future society. This message has been repeated numerous times by deans, presidents, and the very admissions officers who admitted us. Yet we are now faced more bluntly than ever with the reality that some of our peers have gotten here — at least, in no small part — because of their families’ monetary clout. Harvard’s unabashed preference for these applicants undercuts its claim to educate the future leaders of the world.
Moreover, we are disturbed by the way SFFA has attempted to equivocate affirmative action and preference for the children of wealthy donors. It is incredibly reductive to analogize these two admissions preferences. Unlike a preference for the children of wealthy donors, affirmative action is meant to redress, in small part, the inequities that students coming from certain backgrounds face. Affirmative action — especially at an institution like Harvard — can offer disadvantaged students the ability to excel.
Admitting students from wealthy and well-connected backgrounds without a guarantee of the same rigorous process that applies to the rest of the class diminishes the legitimacy of Harvard’s admissions process. SFFA has seized upon this as a way to discredit affirmative action, but this is a slippery slope. By doing so, they conflate these two very different admissions practices. We hope that the courts as well as SFFA come to see the error in their reasoning and the nuances between these two controversial practices. Indeed, one is far more equitable than the other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Black Votes Matter” co-founder LaTosha R. Brown and “Woke Vote” founder DeJuana L. Thompson joined students to discuss black electoral empowerment at the Phillips Brooks House Thursday.
Southerners Organizing Urgent Transformation through Harvard College, a recently formed student group, and the Institute of Politics’ Politics of Race and Ethnicity program co-hosted “Black Voters Matter: Conversation on Black Electoral Empowerment.” The event was intended to engage students from Harvard, Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi, and University of Alabama.
The “Black Votes Matter” and “Woke Vote” programs were designed to mobilize African-American voters in Georgia and Alabama, respectively. According to Brown, there is an unrealized potential of black electoral power in the South.
“We have a particular kind of framework that says there are red-states and blue states,” Brown said. “If you use that as your analysis around who’s progressive and who’s not progressive, then you completely overlook that there are progressive pockets of voters in the Deep South.”
Thompson, former African American Outreach Director for the Democratic National Committee, reflected on why political campaigns are failing to connect with black voters. She criticized politicians who only devote resources to black constituencies immediately before elections instead of forming long-term community partnerships.
“If you look at the way resources come into our communities, if you look at the way anything comes in, it is always aligned with an election cycle,” Thompson said. “You’ve got to invest in these communities to build power, to allow them to grow, but all [politicians are] concerned with — all [they] can see — is the election cycle.”
The discussion about black political empowerment comes in the wake of a recent viral incident where a Black Voters Matter bus was stopped from taking African American senior citizens to the polls in Jefferson County, Ga.
Brown, who was on the bus, was dismayed after the county commissioner forced the director of the group’s living facility to deboard the seniors. She reported that she and her co-founder “literally didn’t sleep that night.” She said the seniors on the bus, however, were less surprised.
“My head was steaming. But the seniors smiled; they were so not shocked. I mean that says something,” Brown said. “It’s almost that there’s an expectation that someone’s gonna interfere.”
When asked by a student how she continues her work in the face of adversity, Brown broke out into song, launching into a verse of Pete Seeger’s “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize.”
Salma Abdelrahman ’20, who hopes to be a community organizer after college, said she was inspired listening to Brown and Thompson speak.
“To see how they use it in their real day-to-day work really, I think, gave me the impetus to keep learning about this stuff and to keep dedicating my life to this stuff,” Abdelrahman said, referring to Brown’s and Thompson’s practical experiences, lessons, and strategies in organizing.
SOUTTH President Trevor W. Ladner ’20, who helped organize the event, said he hoped that students would take away key lessons of inclusion and diversity in electoral activism.
“We talk about trusting black women,” Ladner said. “We need to listen to black women and follow their lead but that often doesn't come with actual investment in black women.”
Investment and enfranchisement, Ladner said, are important ideas accompanying growing political momentum in the South and across the country.
“Midterms are coming up in the next month, and this is an important part of that conversation that needs to be had on campus,” he added.

The Undergraduate Council allocated $3,000 towards a new program that will fund meals at local restaurants for 150 Harvard undergraduates at its Sunday meeting.
Applicants to the program will be randomly placed into groups of six and will receive up to $20 in compensation for the meal.
Lowell House Representative Abby T. Scholer ’21, who sponsored the legislation — dubbed the "Engage and Affirm Together Act" — said the program is targeted to students who do not feel comfortable at large social events and would prefer to meet their peers in a more intimate setting.
“I realized that many people don’t feel comfortable in large-scale party settings, or in something even the size of a House outing,” Scholar said. “And people are also looking for more meaningful connection than you would get going on a kayaking trip with… a group of 40 or 50 or going to a really large rave.”
“This inspired me to create an act that would help students who are feeling a little isolated, feeling maybe not as engaged as they would like to be,” she added.
Scholer added that the $20 price tag per student, though lower than the $30 per person offered by the similar, College-administered Classroom to Table program, will give students plenty of leeway regarding where they can afford to eat.
The UC also voted at its meeting to release a statement calling for more prayer spaces and relaxation rooms on campus.
“Faith, religion, and spirituality are crucial elements of many Harvard students’ lives,” the statement reads. “For students who follow any religion or belief system, the ability to meditate and re-center one’s perspective and priorities can play a pivotal role in keeping students mentally grounded.”
Rewan M. Abdelwahab ’20, the vice president of the Harvard Islamic Society, spoke at the meeting about the challenges she said Muslims on campus currently face in finding places to pray.
“I know a lot of students from our organization and other religious orgs on campus have to resort to praying behind stairwells or other things like that, which has been really inconvenient,” she said.
Student Life Committee chair Arnav Agrawal ’20 said he has held informal conversations with building managers about the possible refurbishment of currently under-utilized spaces for religious use. He said a statement from the entire Council will give “weight” to students’ requests for such spaces.
“If 50 members here today vote on this, this means that, probably, representatives, who I think are pretty plugged in with Harvard’s campus, agree that this is something that students care about,” Agrawal said.
The measure drew pushback from some representatives, who argued that the Council should attempt to address the perceived lack of prayer spaces on its own before issuing a statement.
“This would feed into the idea that the UC doesn't do anything beyond what it says,” said Lowell House Representative Julia M. Huesa ’20.
Huesa added in an interview after the meeting that statements from the Council can be useful in certain cases — such as when dealing with sexual assault and other issues the UC cannot easily fix on its own — but not in situations where the body can act unilaterally.
Also at the meeting, Finance Committee leaders announced they did not impose an across-the-board cut on grants during their semesterly “club sports week,” a week devoted to funding requests from club sports teams. Last year's cut, by comparison, clocked in at 30 percent.
Committee chair Gevin B. Reynolds ’19 attributed the lack of belt-tightening to the committee’s expanded budget this year. The added funds are due in part to Harvard's decision to increase the student activities fee, an optional sum undergraduates pay as part of their enrollment costs, as well as the fact that slightly fewer clubs requested money this semester.
“I can say that even just in the last two years of being on the UC, we’ve never gotten anywhere near close to zero in club sports week,” he said. “So this is just really, really monumental and I’m really excited and thankful for [UC Treasurer] Nadine [Khoury] and the budget she gave us this year to work with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University of Chicago Philosophy Professor Martha C. Nussbaum said that society should grant enhanced legal protections for animals and reconsider the ethical principles governing human-animal interactions at a Friday talk in Boylston Hall.
Nussbaum’s talk — titled ‘Working With and For Animals: Getting the Theoretical Framework Right’ — was the opening keynote lecture for the 12th annual Harvard Graduate Conference in Political Theory. The lecture was co-sponsored by the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and the Government Department and concluded with a discussion between Nussbaum and Priyanka Menon ’16, a graduate student in Government.
Nussbaum began her talk, which was derived from a January article published in the Journal of Human Development and Capabilities, by criticizing current animal rights theories developed by philosopher Jeremy Bentham and Nonhuman Rights Project founder Stephen M. Wise. According to Nussbaum, Wise’s approach over-relies on animals’ resemblance to humans, and Bentham’s framework depends on a potentially faulty conception of animal pleasure and pain.
Nussbaum proceeded to propose a new ethical framework, which she described as a “capabilities approach” and “an approach to justice for both humans and other animals.” Nussbaum also discussed what she described as a lack of consideration for animals under American and international law, and the need for an “ethical revolution, a consciousness-raising movement of truly international proportions” in society’s views on animal rights.
“It typically takes an ethical movement to get law going,” Nussbaum said. Nussbaum added that she hopes that her new framework will spur changes in the way non-human animals are treated by governments around the world.
“It’s time to acknowledge that we share the world with other species, and that what they’re able to do and be matters greatly,” Nussbaum said.
Jacob S. Hoerger, a third-year graduate student in the Government department and the organizer of Nussbaum’s talk, said that the graduate conference aims to provide “a stimulating night of conversation and to try to have talks that are at the forefront of new research.”
He said that he hoped audiences would be “thinking about animal rights issues more seriously than when they walked in the door.”
Daniel T. Roberts, a first-year graduate student in Government department and self-described “anthro-centric” thinker, said he came to the lecture “as an opportunity to challenge my preconceptions and as kind of a healthy thought exercise.”
Though Roberts said he felt that Nussbaum was too quick to dismiss certain opposing views, he also said he found her research “very compelling,” and hopes it can also be applied to solve human problems.
Man Ha Tse, an S.J.D. candidate studying at Harvard Law School, also said she found the talk worthwhile.
“I think, probably, a majority of the population doesn’t even think of this as an issue that is worthy of serious scholarly intention,” she said. “So I always think it’s important to have serious scholars like Martha Nussbaum putting forward these ideas. I think it makes a difference, ultimately, in that way.”
Correction: Oct. 23, 2018
A previous version of this article misstated the gender of Man Ha Tse. It has been updated.

In the wake of all of Harvard’s historically female final clubs and sororities closing or going co-ed following the implementation of penalities against single-gender groups, several undergraduates said they are looking to fill the void left behind by organizing female-oriented programming near campus themselves.
The Muse, a new "female-focused" undergraduate group, is looking to fill in “a lack of female supportive environments” at Harvard by offering self-growth and social programming for female-identifying College students, its undergraduate founders said in an interview.
“The Muse came out of this space where we were really feeling just frustrated on campus not only with sanctions, but just the lack of female supportive environments and spaces on campus,” Meredith E. Pong ’20, a member of the Muse Board, said. “We really think that there needs to be space on this campus where females feel supported and just a space, honestly, to hang out and relax.”
The sanctions, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, varsity team athletic captaincies, and from receiving the College’s endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
Students involved with Muse, which was founded by Pong, Ana M. De Bernardo ’20 and Ellie A. Corbus ’20, are hoping the group can become recognized by the College as an independent student group.
According to De Bernardo, Muse organizers prefer to describe their activities as putting on an “event series,” rather than participating in a club.
“We are branding this as an event series, and not a club that necessitates membership because we are trying to foster a place of inclusion and belonging without the competitive aspect,” De Bernardo said. “It makes more sense to label it as that.”
“We really also just wanted it to not be competitive in anyway: have no comp, have no dues, no punch process, no rush or any things like that to really be inclusive of everyone. Because at Harvard, we feel that so many organizations make you go through a long comp process, or are exclusive in some way of punching,” Pong added. “We just really wanted to create a space that was really open to everyone and welcoming.”
Thus far, the Muse has held one on-campus event featuring outside sponsors Forty Winks, Girls Who Code, and Bulletin.
Attendees to the opening event — which occurred at the end of September — received free personalized dorm decor and giveaways. The event also featured a table of sticky notes where students could write what they felt “was lacking from their social experience” at Harvard.
At least 120 people stopped by the inaugural event, according to the organizers.
“Since it was so serious a prompt, we thought people maybe people won’t opt in, but actually it was the opposite, and people were really willing to share their experiences and thoughts,” Pong said, referring to the sticky note table.
Ali Kriegsman, the COO of women’s fashion chain Bulletin, wrote in a statement that her company was “honored” to support Muse’s event.
“Bulletin decided to partner with The Muse because we’re absolutely baffled by the lack of female-friendly and female-focused spaces on Harvard's campus,” Kriegsman wrote. “It is absolutely critical that women and female-identifying students have a welcoming, safe, owned space they can take up without judgment. We are honored to partner with The Muse and help create - even if momentarily - the space these students deserve.”
In the future, Muse organizers hope to continue hosting female-oriented events focused on self-care and empowerment, including free bra fittings at Forty Winks in Harvard Square next month.

Despite administrators' repeated entreaties, Harvard is still struggling to convince its graduates to go into public service.
Seventy-two percent of Harvard College’s Class of 2018 planned to enter for-profit jobs after graduating last May, according to the most recent employment report released by the College’s Office of Career Services.
Each year, OCS releases a report detailing the future plans of Harvard’s newest graduates. Ninety-eight percent of the Class of 2018 responded to the OCS survey, which asked questions about their careers, employment locations, and any fellowships or grants they had earned. Eighty-seven percent of seniors “answered the relevant questions,” according to the report.
Fourteen percent of graduates indicated they planned to work for non-profit organizations, eight percent indicated they planned to go work for the government or public institutions, and four percent indicated they would freelance or take on individual entrepreneurial pursuits.
The report’s findings come as Harvard is redoubling its efforts to steer graduates toward public service — a post-graduate path College alumni have historically been reluctant to pursue. Twenty-five percent of graduates entered consulting or finance in 2017, while just seven percent entered the public sector or worked for non-profits. Similarly, 25 percent of graduates entered consulting or finance in 2016, while six percent went into the public sector or non-profits.
Newly installed University President Lawrence S. Bacow pitched the importance of public service to alumni and students during his first trip to Washington, D.C. as president this summer. And, in his inauguration speech earlier this month, he reiterated his commitment to to increase funding for undergraduate public service internships.
Harvard’s newest alumni were also awarded 122 fellowships, including seven Rhodes scholarships, one Marshall, 16 Fulbright Grants, and six Schwarzman scholarships.
The idea of immediately enrolling in graduate school seems to have fallen out of vogue at Harvard, according to OCS Director Robin Mount. Fourteen percent of graduating seniors last May said they planned to attend a full-time graduate or professional school, down from 19 percent in 2017.
“Students used to go directly to medical school and law school,” Mount said in an interview. “And now both medical school and law school are really encouraging students to take at least one year off, if not two, so we’re not seeing as many students going straight into graduate school.”
Still, Mount noted that the 14 percent figure excludes students who choose to attend graduate or professional school several years after leaving college.
“About 83 percent of our students will go back to graduate or professional school,” Mount said. Mount describes life after graduation as “a 10-year journey of sort of discovering what you’re interested in, what questions you want to try and answer, where you feel you can make an impact.”
The senior job report also showed that jobs in technology have overtaken consulting in post-grad popularity. The percentage of students going into tech has steadily grown; six percent entered the field in 2013, compared to 11 percent in 2018.
Mount said students are also increasingly interested in “telling diverse stories" — meaning they plan to pursue careers in “creative writing or writing for television or streaming services, music, theater.”
Six percent of the Class of 2018 indicated they were unsure of their future plans. OCS provides guidance and advising after graduation specifically targeted to students suffering from professional indeicison.
After a six month follow-up, “we offer them special help with one of our advisers who’s in the area closest to what they’re interested in,” Mount said.
In line with previous trends, the Class of 2018 showed a clear preference for the country's coasts.
The plurality now reside in New York, Massachusetts, and California. Members of the class can also be found on six continents, with several dozen students in the UK and in China.

Over an 18-year period stretching from 1995 to 2013, Asian-American students admitted to Harvard scored higher on the SAT than did their peer admits from other racial groups, according to data released in the admissions trial last week.
A Crimson analysis of the previously confidential dataset — which spans admissions cycles starting with the Class of 2000 and ends with the cycle for the Class of 2017 — revealed that Asian-Americans admitted to Harvard earned an average SAT score of 767 across all sections. Every section of the SAT has a maximum score of 800.
By comparison, white admits earned an average score of 745 across all sections, Hispanic-American admits earned an average of 718, Native-American and Native-Hawaiian admits an average of 712, and African-American admits an average of 704.
The same general pattern held true for Harvard applicants belonging to these racial groups in this time period. Asian-American applicants on average scored highest on the SAT and African-American applicants scored lowest.
Harvard’s lead lawyer William F. Lee ’72 presented data on the demographic breakdown of applicants and admits’ SAT scores as part of his questioning of Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. Lee’s quizzing of Fitzsimmons on Oct. 18 marked the fourth day of the high-profile trial and the last day of the long-serving dean’s marathon testimony.
The case, which could decide the fate of affirmative action in the United States, kicked off four years ago when anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions sued Harvard over allegations it discriminates against Asian-American applicants. The suit went to trial on Oct. 15 in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston.
In pre-trial filings, SFFA lawyers argued Harvard admissions officers should solely consider “objective” criteria — such as students’ SAT scores and GPAs — when deciding which high schoolers to accept.
Duke economist Peter S. Arcidiacono, whom SFFA retained as an expert witness, wrote in a pre-trial report that, “by controlling for test scores, one can show that [Asian-Americans applicants were] being held to a higher standard than [other applicants], all else equal.”
Harvard and its supporters disagree, arguing the SAT is an imperfect way to measure a candidate’s worth. More than 20 campus student groups filed an amicus brief in July criticizing “SFFA’s erroneous assumption that test scores are a valid and reliable indicator of merit.”
In their own pre-trial filings, University lawyers wrote it would be impossible for the school to rely on SAT scores alone — too many Harvard hopefuls earn perfect marks each year. The attorneys noted that, of the 26,000 American applicants to the Class of 2019, roughly 3,500 had perfect SAT math scores, 2,700 had perfect SAT verbal scores, and nearly 1,000 earned a perfect overall score on the SAT or ACT. Typically, admitted Harvard classes number around 1,700 students.
“The Harvard applicant pool is overwhelmingly strong on all dimensions,” school lawyers wrote in a June court filing. “Given the extraordinary pool of applicants, many of whom have the ability to succeed academically at Harvard, the admissions process is designed to identify those students who manifest the qualities, academic and otherwise, that suggest they will become engaged participants and leaders in an increasingly diverse, complex society.”
The data that emerged Oct. 18 separately aggregates scores for three groups of students: applicants, admits, and students who ultimately matriculated at Harvard. The dataset — which appears to be sourced from internal Harvard records — breaks down College applicants into eight categories: white, Asian-American, African-American, Hispanic-American, Native-American/Native-Hawaiian, international citizen, “Other,” and “Unknown.”
Scores for white, Asian-American, African-American, and Hispanic-American admits remained largely consistent over the time period tracked. Scores for Native-American and Native-Hawaiian students fluctuated more widely, likely a reflection of the fact that these students typically make up a very small percentage of Harvard’s student body.
For students of every race, the average SAT scores of admits were always higher than the average SAT scores of applicants belonging to the same demographic group.
Over the period charted in the dataset, Asian-American applicants to Harvard earned an average SAT score of 726. White applicants earned an average score of 713, Native-American and Native-Hawaiian applicants an average score of 658, Hispanic-American applicants a score of 650, and African-American applicants a score of 622.
Across the same time span, Asian-Americans saw the lowest acceptance rate of any racial group, according to a Crimson analysis of the same dataset. White applicants saw the second-lowest acceptance rate and African-American applicants saw the highest acceptance rate.
On average, 4,910 Asian Americans, 1,938 African Americans, 2,082 Hispanic Americans, 8,685 white students, and 233 Native-American and Native-Hawaiian students applied to Harvard in any given year included in the dataset.
The trial is set to continue Monday morning.

Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 had just hit his sixth hour testifying behind the wood-paneled witness stand in the Harvard admissions trial when things got personal.
The lawyer questioning Fitzsimmons — John M. Hughes, an attorney for Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action advocacy group suing Harvard — pointed to comments College interviewers had scribbled on certain Asian-American students’ application files unearthed during the trial. One interviewer described a female student as "reserved" and "hard-working." “He’s quiet, and of course, wants to be a doctor,” another interviewer wrote of an unnamed male student.
Hughes argued the reviews constitute “model-minority stereotyping” and hint at widespread anti-Asian prejudice in Harvard’s admissions process. SFFA, which sued the University in 2014 over allegations of discrimination in its race-conscious admissions process, is hoping to prove in court that the school rejects qualified Asian-American applicants in favor of less deserving candidates of other races. (Harvard has repeatedly denied all allegations of discrimination.)
Hughes looked Fitzsimmons full in the face. He asked whether the long-serving dean — who joined the admissions office straight out of graduate school in 1972 — condones the “stereotyping” of Asian-American Harvard hopefuls.
Fitzsimmons answered without hesitation.
“We do not endorse — we abhor — stereotypical comments,” he said. “This is not a part of our process. This is not who I am and not who we are.”
It was the second day of the admissions trial, which kicked off Oct. 15 in Courtroom 17 of the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse and is expected to last for roughly three weeks. Fitzsimmons had spent much of the preceding day — and would spend most of the next two — answering detailed questions about how and why his office determines whether high schoolers are Harvard material.
The dean remained calm and composed for most of the morning Tuesday, fielding Hughes’s questions with clinical precision. His impassioned denial of the plaintiffs’ claim that Harvard stereotypes — delivered rapid-fire in forceful tones — marked a crack in his impassive facade. It was the first time he explicitly equated his moral integrity with the integrity of Harvard’s admissions process.
But in some ways, that’s long been true.
Fitzsimmons’s legacy and his ties to Harvard stretch back much further than this October — further than the launch of SFFA’s suit in 2014. He started as an undergraduate at the College in the 1960s and never really left, earning graduate degrees from another University school before embarking on his 32-year tenure as dean in 1986. It’s been decades since Fitzsimmons became the face of Harvard admissions.
In the first week of the high-stakes and high-profile trial, Fitzsimmons repeatedly drew on his personal history at the College, referencing his own experiences as he sought to defend his alma mater.
The trial could decide the fate of affirmative action in the United States. But for Fitzsimmons, it could also decide who he is at Harvard — and how he is remembered.
Intent on preserving both Harvard’s reputation and his own, Fitzsimmons took the witness stand at 2 p.m. Monday and did not leave it — apart from scheduled breaks — until Thursday around the same time.
In total, he spent close to 10 hours during the first week defending against SFFA’s accusation that the way Harvard recruits, evaluates, and selects its students is not only illegal but infected with prejudice.
“You have let the wolf of racial bias in through the front door,” SFFA lawyer Adam K. Mortara said on the opening day of the trial. Attorneys for the group spent the next hours and days trying to force Fitzsimmons to admit it.
[Get caught up on everything that's happened in the Harvard admissions trial so far]
Hughes had his first attack ready as soon as the dean stepped behind the witness stand. He asked Fitzsimmons why white students hailing from “sparse country” — meaning states with low population density — received invitations to apply to Harvard while Asian-American students with higher SAT scores did not.
A Crimson analysis of data released during the trial revealed that, in Harvard admissions cycles stretching from 1995 to 2013, Asian-American applicants earned the highest average SAT score of any racial group that applied to the school. In that same time period, they also saw the lowest acceptance rate of any racial group.
In response, Fitzsimmons said the admissions office seeks out prospective applicants from “all backgrounds, especially those with disadvantaged economic backgrounds.” He said Harvard contacts students “from the heartland of America” because the University is “not on people’s radar” in that part of the country.
He said the College reaches out to these students even if they achieve lower test scores than their peers in urban locales. To prove the benefit of recruiting high schoolers from rural areas, Fitzsimmons noted that his own freshman- and sophomore-year roommate at Harvard — Michael B. Dolan ’67 — was born and raised in South Dakota.
“We do everything we can to reach out to a much broader range of people,” Fitzsimmons said. “We want to break the cycle.”
The next day, Fitzsimmons offered an hours-long justification of the “personal ratings” Harvard admissions officers give to applicants. Documents released over the summer as part of the suit showed that College reviewers tend to give poorer personal scores to Asian-American high schoolers.
Fitzsimmons conceded that personal rankings skew lower for Asian-Americans but attributed this partly to the fact that teacher and counselor recommendations are typically “stronger” for white students. He also emphasized that admissions office employees weigh a plethora of factors when evaluating candidates.
[In admissions, Harvard favors those who fund it, internal emails show]
Ultimately, he said, he’s unsure why white students typically earn higher personal scores. The dean told the audience his job can be hard and confusing.
“We simply know that because we’re aware,” Fitzsimmons said. “It’s our office, and we’re in the business of it. There’s evidence of it.”
“As I said in my deposition, there’s no way, looking at the whole person, to come up with a definitive answer,” he added.
On the third day of the trial, Fitzsimmons faced grilling over Harvard’s special treatment of wealthy and well-connected applicants — and over the “Dean’s Interest List,” a special and confidential list of Harvard applicants with links to top donors who see a significantly inflated acceptance rate.
Fitzsimmons said the tactic is “important for the long-term strength of the institution.” He said favoring Harvard donors ensures funding for scholarships, among other things.
[What one student's marked-up Harvard application reveals about the admissions process]
Once again, he referenced personal experience in an effort to explain how things work — even though, this time around, his testimony was perhaps less likely to win him fans in the courtroom.
Fitzsimmons said that, sometimes, the children of top donors simply aren't College caliber. Even when that happens, the special treatment continues — Fitzsimmons cushions the blow with a personal message.
The dean said he often gives Harvard’s best benefactors “an advance warning” that their kids probably won’t make it to Cambridge.
After hours and hours spent butting heads with SFFA antagonists, Fitzsimmons finally found a friendly face in Harvard lawyer William F. Lee ’72.
When Lee stepped up to examine Fitzsimmons Wednesday, he granted what appeared to be the dean’s fondest wish: He gave Fitzsimmons the chance to talk about his time as a student at the College.
Long before becoming dean of admissions, Fitzsimmons was a record-smashing goalie for Harvard’s varsity hockey team. A resident of Kirkland House and a Social Relations concentrator, Fitzsimmons — known to his friends as “Fitz” or “Fitzy” — saved 91 goals in the 1965 Beanpot tournament, setting a school record which still stands today.
He also participated in several public service organizations including the Phillips Brooks House and the Combined Charities Drive. And he was a member of the Pi Eta club, a social group one member once described as a “blue-collar” final club.
After graduation, Fitzsimmons stayed in Cambridge to attend the Graduate School of Education and obtain his Master’s and doctorate degrees.
He found his professional calling when he joined the admissions office as its director in 1972. Except for a brief stint at the Harvard Fund in the eighties, he never left. He became the dean of admissions in 1986.
In his testimony Wednesday, Fitzsimmons said none of this would have been possible without Havard’s generous financial aid program. He spoke at length about his experiences as a first-generation College student from a low-income background.
The dean said he grew up in Weymouth, Mass. to parents who ran a gas station and a convenience store — which he described as a “mom and pop” operation. He said people in his town never expected anyone they knew would make it to Harvard.
Fitzsimmons told Lee he attended the College “almost entirely with Harvard scholarship funding.” He worked term times and summers to help pay tuition.
“Like many low-income students, I paid my parent’s contribution because they couldn’t afford it,” Fitzsimmons testified.
[Asian-American Harvard applicants saw lowest admit rate of any racial group from 1995 to 2013]
He argued his own life story proves a fundamental truth: Harvard and its affiliates are better off when the school seeks diversity in its student body. Fitzsimmons said the admissions process he has helped shape for the past three decades is structured to ensure high schoolers from a wide range of socioeconomic and racial backgrounds can attend the world’s top-ranked university — and that it shouldn’t work any other way.
“My life has been extraordinarily enriched,” Fitzsimmons said of serving as dean at a time when Harvard’s student body is more diverse than ever before.
In spite of the minute procedural details he has spent years enforcing — and hours recounting on the witness stand — Fitzsimmons said some parts of the Harvard admissions process are simply inexplicable.
“Each individual is unique in the world and how one’s background might speak to that individual is unique,” Fitzsimmons said. “There’s no formula for that.”

The back-to-school festivities have died down, and Halloween decor has begun consuming the nation’s front yards. For college hockey fans, this time of year also signals that the puck has finally dropped on a new season — for most teams, anyway.
October’s arrival has ushered in the annual waiting game endured by the six Ivy League teams in Division-I hockey. Limited to just 29 regular-season contests, compared to 34 for most other squads, the ECAC’s Ancient Eight representatives watched longingly as NCAA play kicked off on Oct. 6.
For Harvard, workouts, skates, and film sessions will have to suffice until Oct. 27, when the team finally begins its five-month campaign with a visit to Ivy rival Dartmouth.
“People are anxious to get [the season] going,” co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage said. “When we have that extra month, it’s something that we can use to our advantage, but at the same time...other teams have five, six games under their belts when we come in. In a way, it could be a disadvantage, but we’re going to try and turn it into as much of an advantage as we can.”
While the delayed start comes with its slew of challenges, there are multiple silver linings. For example, the Crimson’s shorter season keeps players fresher late in the year, and the excitement when the campaign finally does begin can provide an early-season spark on the ice. Another positive is that while Harvard eagerly awaits the Big Green, there is ample time to preview the season ahead.
LESSONS LEARNED
A talented 2017-2018 squad finished a single game above .500 (15-14-4, 11-8-3 ECAC), bowing out to Clarkson in the semifinal round of the annual conference tournament in Lake Placid, N.Y.
Throughout the campaign, the Crimson sought stability but never attained it for long stretches. A rigorous early-season road schedule made it difficult for Harvard to find its groove. Uncertainty in net and the temporary absences of two of the squad’s marquee players, Ryan Donato (Olympic Games) and now-junior Adam Fox (IIHF World Junior Championship), were also instrumental in the lack of consistency.
In the aftermath of the up-and-down season, the Crimson’s takeaways were numerous. But most commonly, team members lamented the critical mistakes that plagued the group in some of its defining contests.
“What we had this year was way too many mistakes that were huge,” said now-co-captain Michael Floodstrand last April, reflecting on the 2017-2018 season. “There wasn’t a game that we played where we were completely out of it…. It was just a culmination of some bad decisions…[and] small mistakes that we couldn’t come back from.”
A last-second loss at Cornell and a season sweep at the hands of Yale support Floodstrand’s regretful sentiment. Even Harvard’s promising run in the ECAC tournament ended in a fittingly crushing fashion, as the team squandered a three-goal lead in the third period and ultimately lost in overtime.
The takeaways from last season are difficult lessons to learn, but they are lessons nonetheless. So the Crimson heads into this season a bit wiser, despite being a great deal younger.
“Last year’s season didn’t end the way we wanted it to, and I think a lot of guys were disappointed in that, especially my class,” senior goaltender Michael Lackey said. “Since we’ve gotten here, we’ve had a pretty successful couple of seasons. We did learn that you can’t take it for granted. There are a lot of great teams. Especially in the ECAC, you could lose or win on any given night.”
THE SCHEDULE AHEAD
Unlike last year, in which Harvard slogged through a program-record nine-game away slate spanning November and December, the Crimson will benefit from a more player-friendly schedule this season. This is especially true early in the season.
The 2018 portion of the docket features only casual road trips, such as the Yale-Brown weekend and a mid-week matchup at nearby Bentley. The notoriously long drives to Cornell and the “North Country” schools, Clarkson and St. Lawrence, occur after the new year.
“Any time you have to go on the road, it takes a lot out of you, whether it’s on the ice or in classes, too,” Zerter-Gossage said. “So the fact that we don’t have that much of a jammed-up schedule early on is definitely going to be helpful.”
That is not to say, however, that Harvard’s schedule is devoid of intense matchups early on. The Bright-Landry Hockey Center will first host Quinnipiac, a team looking to make a statement after logging a sub-.500 record for the first time in its Division-I history last season. Princeton, last year’s ECAC playoff champion, will storm the Crimson’s barn the following evening.
One of Harvard’s most intriguing matchups in 2018 is, in fact, against a familiar foe. Over Thanksgiving break, the team will meet storied rival Cornell in Manhattan for the Frozen Apple, a clash under the historic roof of Madison Square Garden.
This game will count as an extra third meeting between the two teams and will not have ECAC implications. Nevertheless, it’s a circle-your-calendar event for all involved.
“[The Frozen Apple] is going to be great,” Zerter-Gossage said. “Any time you get to play in a NHL rink, whether it’s the Beanpot or at MSG, it’s a really special experience. A lot of people are going to have family there and different friends, so I think it’s going to hold a lot more value in that way, too.”
It won’t be long before the Crimson is once again staring down the ice at the Big Red. Just a week after the Frozen Apple, Cornell and travel partner Colgate will trip to Cambridge in early December. Harvard will look to avenge two series sweeps from last season — both teams’ lockdown defenses stifled the Crimson in 2017-2018.
After the four-week winter recess, the squad will ring in the new year with a pair of home games, including a matchup with cross-town rival Boston University. A long-standing tradition between the two squads, not to mention a double-overtime loss in the 2018 Beanpot semifinals, will motivate Harvard in that mid-week contest.
The matchup with the Terriers kicks off a stretch of formidable opponents, including road bouts with Princeton, Quinnipiac, Cornell, and Colgate throughout January. When the Crimson returns home, Clarkson and St. Lawrence will be waiting for them, and so will the student body, returning from a lengthy winter break.
The following Monday, the Beanpot will seize the attention of New England’s hockey fans, as it does each year. This season, Harvard will battle Boston College for a spot in the final a week later. The two teams skated in last year’s Beanpot consolation game, and neither squad wants to play in the subordinate game in an eerily quiet TD Garden this time around.
Three weekend back-to-backs, including two in upstate New York, conclude the regular-season schedule for the Crimson. As in every campaign, the group will then turn its attention to the conference tournament, with the goal of reaching Lake Placid for the fifth straight year.
“Our goals were made pretty consistent throughout my time here,” Floodstrand said. “Obviously, a National Championship is something that we’re talking about…. We want to win our league, we want to win the Ivy League, and we want to win the Beanpot.”
FRESH FACES TO FILL EMPTY SPACES
One of the central questions surrounding the Harvard program has been whether the group can continue replacing the talent it loses each year to graduation and professional hockey. Having iced the likes of Jimmy Vesey ’16, Kyle Criscuolo ’16, and Alexander Kerfoot ’17 in recent seasons, it is only natural for this concern to arise.
“You look around and you don’t see some of the familiar faces, and you wonder who’s going to fill those voids,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It also brings with it an energy with a lot of new faces and young guys…. I think last year we [replaced players effectively]. Two years ago, probably even more so with all the guys we lost.”
Entering the 2018-2019 campaign, the Crimson is tasked with filling voids left not only by the class of 2018, but also by a pair of forwards who are not rejoining the team.
At the end of last season, the group’s most potent weapon up front, then-junior Ryan Donato, put his degree on pause to pursue a NHL career with the hometown Boston Bruins. Meanwhile, forward Ty Pelton-Byce, a would-be junior at Harvard this fall, failed to meet criteria for academic eligibility and will no longer don the crimson and white.
These departures, numbering nine in total, do not impact the roster evenly. The blue line looks to be the strength of this year’s iteration of the Crimson, whereas scoring depth is less certain.
“When you lose a guy like Ryan Donato, that’s obviously tough because you have to put the puck in the net a lot,” Floodstrand said. “But we’ve lost guys in the past before…. As far as coming back, I’m super confident in this group. I think that we have what it takes to win a National Championship and win the league, and definitely give everyone a lot of trouble.”
The team returns five of its six defensive mainstays from last season — seniors Adam Baughman and Jacob Olson, juniors John Marino and Fox, and sophomore Reilly Walsh — and should have reasonable depth at the position thanks to returning players and viable freshmen options.
Freshman Jack Rathbone, a 4th-round selection in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, is the front runner for the final spot in the top six and has skated alongside both Fox and Marino in pre-season practices.
“I kind of have a sense of what they’re doing on certain plays,” said Lackey on the benefits of a playing behind a familiar, veteran blue line. “I know their tendencies, how they play certain situations, so I can get a better read off of what they’re doing.”
The forward ranks provide more opportunity for players to break into the lineup. With Donato’s early exit for the NHL and Pelton-Byce’s unforeseen ineligibility, the group promises to be especially young down the middle. During Donato’s Olympic absence last season, Pelton-Byce thrived as the first-line center, implying he would man the post full-time this year. Plans have changed, of course.
Sophomore Jack Badini will build upon a solid freshman campaign as he pivots the top line. Early indicators suggest that rookie Jack Drury will command the second-line center spot for much of the season, with primarily underclassmen contending for bottom-six center roles.
“Our team is relatively young, but we’ve got a lot of new offensive threats coming in from the freshman class,” said Lackey, challenging any doubters of the team’s scoring capabilities.
Hence, while co-captains Floodstrand and Zerter-Gossage and junior Nathan Krusko will provide experience up front, the forward corps will be relatively young overall. In addition to Badini and Drury, sophomore Henry Bowlby and freshmen Baker Shore and Casey Dornbach should be integral parts of the team’s attack this year.
Between the pipes, Lackey will assume starting duties now that Merrick Madsen ’18 has walked the stage. The Washington, D.C., native, who will also sport Madsen’s former No. 31, played in ten games last year and finished with a 2.72 goals against average and a .899 save percentage.
With an ostensibly more stable starting role, Lackey will look to improve upon these numbers, which understate his effectiveness in the majority of his 2017-2018 appearances.
Only time will tell whether the Crimson has replaced — or even improved upon — important lost pieces. Despite the fact that program culture may not vary much from year to year, a unique squad with its own playing style will inevitably take the ice on Oct. 27.
SPEED KILLS
While most characterizations of the team are pure speculation until the games start, fans can expect this year’s version of Harvard hockey to play a faster style than the group that coach Donato iced last year. Young forwards will fill spots left by checking-line players, and what the back end lost in size with the departure of the towering Wiley Sherman ’18, it gained in speed and puck skills in the newcomer Rathbone.
“What we’re going to want to do is be a team that is extremely fast, extremely high-paced, loves to play off the rush, loves to have a quick transition game, and then [be] a four-line team that can keep coming and coming and coming,” Floodstrand said. “Speed, relentless work ethic, and depth are things that we definitely can have and are going to work towards.”
Over the summer, Harvard made a key change in its staff, welcoming in new Assistant Coach Jim Tortorella upon Associate Head Coach Paul Pearl’s departure for BU. In addition to a younger roster composition, the new voice behind the bench may be another cause for tweaks in the Crimson’s systems.
“Coach Tortorella is a very good coach. He’s a detailed guy, and you could tell that right away,” said Fox, just one week after first taking the ice with the 2018-2019 squad. “It’s good to have him around [to] understand the little parts you might not be paying attention to.”
Through the first few weeks of practice, coach Tortorella has reemphasized structure on special teams, among other strategic adjustments. The delayed start to the season will allow the team to hone its systems more closely, although there will be more to modify once the games start.
“As an older guy, it’s more of a responsibility in guiding the younger guys into it,” Zerter-Gossage said. “It’s kind of cool to be on the senior side of that spectrum, but I think guys are fitting into the system pretty well so far. Obviously, you can’t really say much until we’ve played a real game.”
BREAKING OUT OR BREAKING IN
Skaters who have been permanent staples on the starting roster have a chance to make significant strides this year. These year-to-year improvements would not only propel the individual players to new heights, but would also be instrumental to Harvard’s team-wide success.
Chief among the players on the cusp of a breakout year is Zerter-Gossage. The newly minted co-captain attended his third NHL Development Camp this summer and honed his game throughout the off-season. Teammates have taken notice that the Montréal, Qué., native is leading by example.
“LZG has been looking pretty good,” Fox lauded. “I know he’s been putting a lot of work in in his free time. I think he did pretty well at his [Pittsburgh] Penguins Development Camp.”
With Ryan Donato, Zerter-Gossage’s linemate for the better part of two seasons, no longer in the picture for the Crimson, the senior will have an opportunity to flourish as the go-to option on his line and on the powerplay, where he has historically used his size and his hands to score gritty goals down low.
Based on pre-season practice lines, Zerter-Gossage will almost assuredly flank a young centerman and wing, meaning that his mentorship will be as crucial to a potential break-out season as his production.
Of course, Harvard will need more than a stellar solo performance from its co-captain to achieve its National Championship aspirations. The team will also look to Krusko for significant top-six scoring this year.
The undersized but crafty winger has skated with the first and second lines in pre-season practice. As a freshman, Krusko took home Beanpot MVP honors and showed his knack for potting pucks. The following year, the Alpharetta, Ga., product was more so a playmaker whom coach Donato used in multiple roles.
“As far as personal development goes, I think every guy on the team would say that they want to find a way to contribute more,” Krusko said. “I really want to take a more offensive position this year and find ways to contribute more offensively. The coaching staff has given me some insights, and they’re thinking the same way.”
Substantial roster turnover is a pre-season trope that most players, coaches, and fans are tired of hearing. For some members of the Harvard squad, however, it offers the break they have long been waiting for.
The bulk of the team’s production will likely come from returning weapons, such as Zerter-Gossage, Krusko, Badini, and Bowlby up front and Fox and Walsh on the blue line. That said, opening-night roster spots are still up for grabs for skaters who have less in-game experience. Junior Colton Kerfoot, sophomore Jack Donato, and freshman RJ Murphy have battled throughout the pre-season for the final few starting slots. Junior Frédéric Grégoire and sophomore Benjamin Solin, both of whom showed promising flashes last season, are also favorites to crack the opening-night lineup based on early practice lines.
“I think the games give us a much better indicator from an evaluation standpoint, but I do think the guys recognize there’s a pretty big void of, let’s say, important minutes that went out the door last year,” coach Donato said. “There’s guys with designs on filling those shoes, which is great. That’s what feeds good teams, is an internal competition.”
Defensively, Harvard’s right side of Fox, Marino, and Walsh is arguably one of the strongest in college hockey. That is not to say, though, that the left side lacks talent. A major component of the Crimson’s success this season will be the play of Baughman, Olson, and Rathbone alongside this stellar right side.
Ultimately, each new season is riddled with as many opportunities as it is unknowns. If the Harvard program is determined to return to the success of 2017’s Frozen Four run, it will have to close out winnable contests and rely on players to thrive in their new roles.
“You can see the hunger from all the older guys and the young guys as well,” Drury said. “[There’s been] a lot of reference to the spot the team was in two years ago, and getting back to that spot — the Frozen Four — and then capitalizing on that. But it’s a long way to go, and we have to follow our process here in the beginning of the season and take care of business.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Big Green bench chanting across the net, sophomore outside hitter Mindie Mabry serves the ball, landing it right on the line for an ace to give the Crimson a four point lead in the second set.
Following a road loss to Yale, Harvard traveled back home to take on Dartmouth on Friday. This game began the Crimson’s stretch of playing each Ancient Eight team another time as the team continues its quest for the conference title.
Harvard recovered from losing in an early season battle against Dartmouth, three sets to two. Following a close first set, the Crimson (9-8, 4-4 Ivy) took control against the Big Green (7-11, 3-5), winning the next three games to take the match.
In the first set, Harvard came out slow, trading points with Dartmouth. The Big Green began to pull away, at one point leading 19-13, but the Crimson capitalized on Dartmouth errors, two aces from sophomore outside/defensive specialist Sandra Zeng, and a kill from captain Christina Cornelius to bring the set within two points. Even with this effort, the visitors took the set, 25-22.
According to Cornelius, the first set provided a springboard for the rest of the game as the team wanted to continue the fight against the Big Green.
“Although we started off pretty slow, we got our momentum in the second game which was really good. We got super energetic,” Cornelius said. “We had a good pep talk after that first game and I think it just gave us the confidence and the motivation to push harder, be louder and be confident.”
The second set also began with the back-and-forth seen earlier. Led by junior outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank, freshman setter and outside hitter Bella Almanza and Cornelius, Harvard overtook Dartmouth, outscoring the Big Green 10-4 to finish the set. The trio combined for four kills and Almanza recorded three assists on the stretch.
From the outset of the third set, the Crimson dominated the Big Green, causing errors at the line and at the net. The team in turn capitalized on these errors, as its defense and offense worked cohesively to collect both 13 kills and the set, 25-21.
“We also had really tough serves that got them out of system so we were able to run our own transition game and get them out of system,” Cornelius said. “So I think that also worked very well for us today. It is an amazing feeling when our defense and our offense all comes together.”
This cohesion continued into the fourth set, in which Harvard set the tone early as the team permanently gained the lead with a score of 5-4. The entire court attacked the ball throughout the set with six different Crimson players recording kills. This Harvard offensive attack propelled the team to defeat Dartmouth by 10 in the final set. According to Cornelius, the team has utilized practice to bolster these efforts to have a cohesive team where the defense and the offense work together.
“It just repetition and repetition in practice and just making sure that hitters are giving good feedback to the setters and the setters receive it,” Cornelius said. “We make sure that we extend ourselves outside of our range and we get balls that we don’t think that we can get.”
Following this win over Dartmouth, the Crimson will continue to play the other six Ivy League teams. According to Cornelius, with the transition into the second half of the season the team is already comfortable with the tendencies of their opponents.
“We have a better read on all of the teams since we have actually played them before,” Cornelius said. “We can’t wait to use everything that we have got in practice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a heavyweight clash between two of the top three teams in the Ivy League, the Harvard women’s soccer team entered Saturday night’s contest at Princeton needing a win to keep pace with conference leader Penn. Under the lights on Sherrerd Field at Class of 1952 Stadium, the Crimson started quickly, firing off the first two shots of the game within the opening ten minutes.
Harvard continued to put pressure on Tigers junior goalkeeper Natalie Grossi in the first half, forcing her into three saves before halftime. The away side was not able to capitalize, however, leaving the door open for Princeton to seize control of the game after the intermission.
Seize control is precisely what the Tigers did, as two goals by junior forward Courtney O’Brien put the home team up for good. The Crimson was not able to repeat its heroics from the previous weekend — when it came back from 2-0 down on the road against Brown to win, 3-2 — and was ultimately shut out, 2-0, this time around.
With the victory, Princeton (9-3-2, 3-1-1 Ivy) moved into a tie with Harvard (6-6-1, 3-1-1 Ivy) for second place in the Ivy, with two games remaining for both sides. Coupled with the 2-1 win that Penn pulled out over Columbia hours earlier, the Tigers and the Crimson now both sit three points back of the league leaders.
“We knew going in that Princeton would be a very strong opponent, [having been] in and out of the Top-25 all year,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “I thought we did an excellent job taking the game to them in the first half, but unfortunately we weren’t able to capitalize and they turned it around in that second half.”
O’Brien supplied the fireworks on the field Saturday night, as her goals in the 47th and 60th minutes were all the Tigers needed to come out on top. The first came against the run of play, just after sophomore forward Murphy Agnew saw a great opportunity saved by Grossi on the other end of the field. She collected the ball at the left side of the box, turned to shift the ball to her right foot, and fired low into the bottom left corner of the goal.
Thirteen minutes later, O’Brien tacked on a well-placed, lofted header to secure the brace. The two goals were her first of the season, as she finally broke through after getting on the score sheet several times earlier in the season for assisting goals.
The Crimson was able to keep star forward Mimi Asom quiet for most of the night, save for her assist on O’Brien’s opening goal. Asom entered the game leading the Ivy League with 55 shots and 10 goals to her name, but the visitors limited her to three shots and lone assist on Saturday.
“They have a lot of players who can score in a lot of different ways,” said Harvard captain and midfielder Leah Mohammadi. “We were able to do a good job defending Mimi, but then Courtney O’Brien ended up being to one to hurt us.”
On the other side, the Crimson saw four players — Agnew and Mohammadi, along with freshman forward Jordan Di Verniero and freshmen defender Jillian Wachira — contribute two shots each to a final total of nine shots, five of which were on goal. Another newcomer, freshman Sophie Hirst, tacked on a lone shot.
After using seven substitutions in the non-conference tilt at BU and four substitutions against Brown last week, Hamblin went with just two on Saturday. Di Verniero and freshman midfielder Lara Schenk were the only ones to make an appearance off the bench for Harvard, as the back line played the full 90 minutes.
“We were playing well in the first half, and it made sense to us to keep who we had on the field,” Hamblin said. “A lot of times, teams will sit back and try to hit Princeton on the counter, but with the personnel we had on the field, we were able to be aggressive and create quite a few quality chances.”
While the contest marked a happy return to the scoresheet for O’Brien, who collected her first two goals of the season after scoring nine in 2017, it was also a significant one for Grossi. With the shutout of the Crimson, Grossi tied the all-time shutouts record for a Tigers goalkeeper. She and Kelly A. O’Dell, Princeton Class of 1983, are now tied with 23 shutouts apiece, and Grossi will have at least two more opportunities to grab her 24th and sole possession of the record.
Harvard, meanwhile, will look regain the touch that powered its four-game scoring streak in next week’s matchup against Dartmouth. Any more dropped points now will likely knock the Crimson out of the race for the conference title.
“We’re obviously down after the loss,” Mohammadi said. “But we know we’re still in the running and we’re going to make sure to come out and play accordingly next week. You never know what can happen in the Ivy League, and we want to send it to the final weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nearly a decade of tinkering with new designs and rethinking old ideas, Frank Joseph Zamboni, Jr., filed a patent application for his Model A ice resurfacer in 1949. Nearly 70 years later, Zambonis are a constant at ice hockey rinks, reliably smoothing the ice before each game and after every period.
Any given time these teams face off, a Harvard women’s ice hockey win over Dartmouth at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center has become almost a guarantee. With all three of the Crimson’s goals coming from freshmen in the most recent showdown, the streak looks likely to continue.
For the ninth consecutive home match-up between the two teams, Harvard (1-0, 1-0 ECAC) emerged with a win over Dartmouth (0-1, 0-1 ECAC) despite an early lead by the visitors. The 3-1 triumph marked the Crimson’s fourth victorious start to the regular season in four years and built on a 4-0 victory over McGill University in the team’s only preseason match.
In the first period, after a flurry of Harvard activity in the Big Green’s defending zone saw 15 Crimson shots to Dartmouth’s three, a power play against Harvard in the 10th minute delivered a spell of offensive rest for the Crimson as the team killed the power play. However, a minute later, the Big Green’s Rose Falzone managed to slip a shot past freshman goalie Lindsay Reed.
At the conclusion of the first frame, despite Harvard’s 27 shots to Dartmouth’s 17, the Big Green held the 1-0 lead. The teams emerged 15 minutes later to a renewed rink, courtesy of a Zamboni — and the Crimson emerged with renewed vigor.
“I would say we really kept it really positive,” said captain and forward Kate Hallett when asked about Harvard’s turnaround. “One thing for us is always bouncing back and just kind of getting back to the basics on things.”
The Crimson’s upbeat attitude proved effective. Two minutes into the second period, a successful Harvard faceoff by freshman defender Kyra Willoughby led to a pass from freshman forward Katie Tresca to a third freshman, left wing Anne Bloomer. Three short touches and a swift shot later, Bloomer notched her first collegiate goal and put the Crimson on the board.
Aside from a 13th minute pipe-hitter by Willoughby, the next 16 minutes of the half appeared evenly matched.
Suddenly, a commotion in front of Dartmouth’s net in the 19th minute saw two Big Green skaters come up stickless. Harvard Freshman forward Dominique Petrie dove stick-first for a pass from sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich. A precise push of the puck, and the Crimson snatched the lead, taking a 2-1 advantage into the third period on Petrie’s goal.
Solid defense from Harvard and Dartmouth alike defined the final stretch of the game, a single goal separating the Big Green from overtime and a possible victory.
Then, a desperate goalie pull by Dartmouth brought the contest to a close. Only 11 seconds after senior goalie Christine Honor left the ice in the 18th minute of the third period, a breakaway by Petrie earned the Crimson a third freshman goal and sealed Harvard’s successful defense of its home rink.
Captain and forward Lexie Laing, who played her 100th game in a Crimson uniform on Friday night, was impressed by the team’s ability to rebound after allowing an early goal from the Big Green.
“I thought that we definitely showed a lot of resilience,” Laing said. “We got down first and then came back, and kept pushing the pace, so that was a good overall game.”
Harvard’s promising freshman roster has contributed four goals and multiple saves between the first preseason and regular season games. Several, including Petrie and Bloomer, even clocked minutes with the United States U-18 National Team.
“They’ve come to play, and they’ve come in with some confidence, which is huge,” Hallett said.
The Crimson faces a set of away games next weekend, first against No. 7 Cornell on Friday and followed closely by a game against ECAC powerhouse Colgate on Saturday. Harvard has no plans to leave its game-winning resilience behind in Massachusetts.
“It’s gonna be huge that we focus on game one, and then after the fact,” Hallett said, “no matter the result — hopefully it’s a win — we’re ready to turn around so we can get the W.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As midterm exams come to a close, Harvard crew underwent its first test of the year. Over the course of last weekend, the Crimson participated in numerous races at the Head of the Charles Regatta, including the men’s club eights and lightweight fours, which both managed to secure the best times in their respective races.
Harvard placed first in the men’s club eights with a time of 14:46.85 and the women’s lightweight fours with a time of 20:07.050.
“The team overall is extremely happy with its performance,” said Erica Holmes, captain of the women’s heavyweight team. “It was a really fantastic day for us.”
For the women’s championship eights, the Harvard women’s team not only beat several other schools, securing 12th place, but managed to beat its time at the Head of the Charles last year.
“That shows huge improvement for us,” Holmes said. “Really great progress from where we were this time last year.”
Senior David Wexner, captain of the men’s lightweight crew, described his team’s performance as a mixed bag.
“I think some boats outperformed the rank; that’s always good to see,” Wexner said. “Our lightweight eight was third last year, sixth this year. You would like to see that place a little better.”
One thing Wexner mentioned that his team executed well was managing the conditions associated with the race, including the large headwind that occurred during the race.
Holmes also credits her teammates for the great job they did navigating the wind that occurred during their race.
“The wind was really tough today,” Holmes said. “Huge, huge gusts of wind, which gave us a lot of technical things to focus on, like getting the blades to the water faster.”
Not even cold, brittle temperature could drive spectators away from the race. Throughout the day, as the rowers competed, they felt the presence of the large body of spectators cheering them on.
“We would have a huge support base at Weld, our boathouse,” Holmes said. “Hundreds of alumni and family friends that are cheering for us.”
When describing what her thought process was throughout the race, Holmes mentioned the importance of finding the boat’s stride.
“We had a goal to settle in to a good rhythm,” Holmes said. “Once we found that rhythm we knew we were going to have a good race.”
Notable performances on the men’s side include placing fifth in the men’s club fours, placing first, eighth, and ninth in the men’s club eights, and placing sixth in the men’s championship eights. Harvard also placed sixth and ninth in the men’s lightweight eights.
On the women’s side, the Radcliffe crew finished first in the women’s lightweight fours and also placed fifth and ninth in the women’s lightweight eights. In the clubs eight, the team finished with a top time of 16:57.56 but was disqualified.
Overall, Harvard’s performance was a good one, with the Crimson managing to secure not one, but three first-place victories.
“Our team is really excited for the coming year ahead,” Holmes said. “We are in a much better place than this time last year. The team worked really hard over the summer to come back stronger. We have seen that show this weekend.”

Halloween is just around the corner and it’s crunch time to plan and put together your costumes for the not one, but two Halloweekends this year. (Hey, Halloween is next Wednesday, so it’s your choice how much or how little you want to celebrate.) To be a real showstopper at Harvard Halloween parties, dress up as an iconic person or feature of Harvard Culture.
Sexy David Malan (we know, it’s redundant)
David Malan is one of the most well-known professors on campus, and, luckily for you, his standard uniform is easy to copy for a killer Halloween costume. All you need is a black shirt, some jeans, and black shiny shoes. Carrying around a rubber duck, stress ball, phone book, or strategic spray bottle to get his signature sweating-under-the-production-lights look is recommended. This is CS50.
Death of Harvard Time
We are all still mourning the loss of Harvard time, those beautiful seven minutes that saved students across campus. For this costume, you will need to get a clock (or picture of a clock) that is 7 minutes past and make yourself up to look dead. Warning: We are not responsible for the masses of upperclassman mournfully crying when they see you on Halloween.
Your Lost Dignity
This costume requires a little more work and absolutely zero shame. Use a large poster board to become a wanted sign for your dignity. Last Seen: Cabot Aquarium, halfway through first semester freshman year. Outfit: Not warm enough for the weather. Seen With: Last name still unknown, but pops up at the dining hall every now and then. This way, nights that have haunted you in the nature of dhall run-ins for a year can now help you haunt others this Halloween.
Former Harvard President, Drew Faust
To pay homage to our last president, dressing up as Drew Faust will easily earn you the respect of students and faculty alike. For this costume you need: a green scaly body suit, a rattle to attach to your tail—I mean feet—and an adaptation of your best hissing voice. Nothing but respect for our Goldman Sachs board member.
The John Harvard Statue
Not only is this a great costume, but it’s also a perfect disguise to help you check off one of the tasks on the Harvard Bucket List. Just get some metallic spray paint and some 17th century clothes, maybe enlisting a couple friends to act as tourists. Note: Flyby is not responsible for any drizzles you may welcome.
Use any of these ideas to shake up the normal Halloween go-tos of sexy cops and firemen, in favor of a more unique costume. With our advice you can get noticed, remembered, and likely photographed and snap-storied by strangers at parties this Halloween Season.
