Flanked by an army of face-tethered Jason lookalikes, Canadian musician Abel Tesfaye, better known as the Weeknd, moonwalked his way into a cinematic performance at the Super Bowl LV halftime show. Sporting a sequined red blazer and a pair of vintage wingtips — his signature ensemble from the “After Hours" era — Tesfaye danced the night away against the digitized backdrop of the Las Vegas strip.
In a variety of ways, his performance was one for the books.
Instead of continuing the long tradition of including guest artists in the set, Tesfaye orchestrated a show centered entirely around himself. For the first time ever, the stage was embedded in the stands, accompanied by a massive choir caroling in the skyline of Sin City. Likewise, the graphics on this set were more prevalent compared to previous ones, with LED backgrounds, steam machines, and fireworks ablaze to make the show as immersive as it could be in the absence of an audience.
Every non-sports fanatic who begrudgingly endured Sunday’s game in anticipation of its infamous halftime shows got exactly what they bargained for in the mirror segment of the halftime show, Twitter and Instagram alike quickly flocking to memeify the singer being up close and personal with a GoPro in the fun house.
His lineup included a mix of nostalgic throwbacks and more recent hit singles that perfectly captured what’s made Tesfaye so successful. Hidden gem “House of Balloons” merged with “Earned It,” symbolizing the start of his career as an unknown producer at rundown clubs. Self-released debuts slowly but surely gave way to some of his biggest XO bops like “The Hills” and “Can’t Feel My Face”. “I Feel It Coming” transitioned the set to the middle of the decade, a period of time when Tesfaye was cementing his fame as the “Starboy” with his collaborative partners Daft Punk. As he neared the end of the set, the height of his recent stardom was brought out with the hit “Save Your Tears.” It all culminated into the showstopper “Blinding Lights,” ending the night on a high note — literally.
It might surprise you to know that Tesfaye didn’t earn a cent for such an iconic performance — on the contrary, he paid 7 million dollars for it! Don’t worry though, he’ll more than likely make up for it with the 385% increase in his music sales post-show.
While the set could justifiably be called a rundown of the Weeknd’s top 10 chart-topping hits, (straight off The Highlights album Tesfaye dropped two days before his halftime show took place) the difference lies in the way he constructed their order. Whereas his music anthology starts out with all of the funky, disco-esque songs and concludes with the more mature sounds of his mellow tunes, his halftime performance was the exact opposite. Just like Tesfaye’s career, it started off with his melancholy, foundational sound and concluded with the more upbeat mainstream bops, chronicling his multifaceted rise to fame.
All in all, the audience got more than just a halftime show last Sunday: They witnessed an entire retrospective of struggling artist Abel Tesfaye’s transformation into the global popstar sensation the Weeknd.

Waking up and walking out the door without having to spend a second styling your hair sounds like a dream, right? For Tessica Brown, this dream became a reality when she used Gorilla Glue Spray Adhesive to achieve a slicked-back ponytail — but it soon became a nightmare when, despite 15 washes, her hair wouldn’t budge for almost a month.
On Feb. 4, the 40-year-old posted a video on TikTok explaining how she swapped her empty can of Got 2b Glued Blasting Freezing Spray for the heavy duty Gorilla Glue adhesive to hold her hair in place. The video has since gone viral, accumulating millions of views across social media platforms. But the most shocking (and heartwarming) part isn’t the actual hair mishap: It’s the internet’s response.
While there were certainly viewers who watched, laughed, and continued to scroll unfazed, an outstanding amount of people extended their sympathy to “#gorillagluegirl,” including big names like Chance the Rapper. Supporters came to her aid in the comments section, bouncing ideas back and forth in an attempt to find a solution. For example, some supporters suggested trying to shave off the glue with a razor, which didn’t bode well for her hair.
Public concern for Brown’s recovery continued to grow as she posted videos updating followers on her situation. In one video, Brown vigorously applies shampoo to her scalp, on the verge of tears when she wipes away the soap to reveal no change. In another, she sits visibly in pain while her sister applies acetone, attempting to dissolve the glue.
Brown’s experience prompted important conversations about the lack of awareness surrounding Black hair care. Many articles and posts have pointed to her accident as an example (albeit extreme) of the difficulties that Black women face styling their hair and finding adequate products. “The View” co-host Sunny Hostin spoke out against those dismissing Brown with her tweet, “Given the history of how black women are targeted and still battle the pervasive belief that our natural hair is unprofessional, unkempt, or in some way ‘a statement’ pls show her some grace and understanding.”
Support for Brown moved from social media platforms to GoFundMe when she started a page to help cover medical expenses, raising over $20,000 in just five days. Fortunately, after an exhausting journey through emergency room visits and chemical treatments, the glue in Brown’s hair was successfully removed by plastic surgeon Dr. Michael Obeng’s homemade solvent in Los Angeles on Feb. 11. Other than a bit of irritation from the chemical treatments she had used, Brown left the surgery with no severe injuries to her scalp.
Brown’s video could have been one of many that disappear into the sea of oddity that is social media, shrugged off as another ridiculous publicity stunt. While she received her fair share of backlash and criticism, the online attention led her to a multitude of people who offered advice and assistance, serving as an important reminder that generosity and kindness are still overwhelmingly present despite the craziness of today’s world.

In her newest single, a remix of her iconic “Friday,” Rebecca Black takes listeners on a chaotic, strobe-light-filled trip to 2010s internet meme culture’s heyday that will have listeners once again unconsciously humming, “It's Friday, Friday / Gotta get down on Friday.” But perhaps more significant feature of this unexpected remix is Black’s reclamation of “Friday'' for herself after dealing with online bullying and mockery since the original song’s release.
February 10, 2021 marked 10 years (or approximately 522 Fridays) since the original release of Rebecca Black’s polarizing yet extremely catchy anthem “Friday.” A few days before this decennial anniversary, Black tweeted that the original “Friday” had been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and that she would be dropping a surprise remix of the song 10 years after its initial release. With features from Dorian Electra, Big Freedia, and 3OH!3, the new version turns the original bubblegum pop song upside down to create the ideal glorious and chaotic hyperpop meme for 2021.
In a stark contrast from the suburban, home video aesthetics of the 2011 version, the new music video’s opening warning for strobe lights hints at the song’s complete transformation. A drastically different, mature version of Rebecca Black now sports leather and blue spikes instead of jeans and backpacks. At the same time, however, the music video makes nods to the original’s meme-like quality by including troll faces and other iconic images that allude to 2011 pop culture. As for the song itself, there is never a dull moment: When the chipmunk-like vocals are just about to become grating, the features from Dorian Electra, Big Freedia and 3OH!3 inject new changes by introducing slower, melodic verses or intense, head-banging rap verses. If the original “Friday” represented the joys of the school bell ringing at 3:00 p.m., this revamped version represents the chaos of late Friday evenings complete with strobe lights, hyperpop vocals, and driving rhythms.
With its overload of autotuned vocals and loud electronic instrumentals, the song may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but Black deserves credit for reclaiming “Friday.” Many can remember how Black experienced online abuse and bullying after the song’s unexpected rise to fame when she was just 13. Seemingly overnight, she received hate messages, dislikes, and parodies from all corners of the internet, but with this new remix of “Friday,” Rebecca Black embraces the bizarre, whimsical quirks of the original — even turning them up a notch to make it her own purposefully chaotic song. Despite what the previous backlash for her usage of autotune may suggest, Black can actually sing and make music, as evidenced by her other latest release: the more mainstream, moody pop “Girlfriend.”
As Rebecca Black transitions into making music that she, not the internet, gets to define, this remix of “Friday” is just a fun nod to her unique start in music. Nonetheless, there is no shame in singing along to “It's Friday, Friday / Gotta get down on Friday,” 10 years later.

In one episode of Sky Atlantic’s “I Hate Suzie,” Suzie (Billie Piper) attends a rehearsal for a new experimental musical titled “The Party of Monica Lewinsky” and finds herself in a circle of her castmates discussing Monica’s possible motivations when she first entered the Oval Office. “Sex,” “power,” and “approval” are all suggested before the director (Joshua James) throws the question to Suzie, who seems annoyed. “People don’t walk around wanting things, that’s not how it is,” she responds, “at least not for women.”
Messy female characters are having a moment in TV. There’s “The Queen Gambit”’s troubled chess-master Beth, who struggles with drug addiction. There’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s simultaneously charming and cruel Fleabag. There’s “The Flight Attendant’s” Cassie, whose murder-mystery storyline explores trauma and memory with touching honesty. It is certainly refreshing to see television begin to flesh women out, to give female characters the space to be imperfect, while still establishing them as worthy of humanity and love. A lot of these shows, however, focus on giving excuses for their character’s complexity, and often (at least in the case of the three shows listed above, that excuse is trauma and grief. While these women’s stories are important and often masterfully told, there’s still an element of oversimplification here: the idea that women can be flawed, or “complicated” — but only if they have a good enough reason.
“I Hate Suzie” takes the next step forward. The British dark comedy premiered for U.S. audiences on HBO Max last November and follows Suzie, an actress and former child pop-star, as she grapples with the blowback of having her nudes leaked. Suzie is a complicated person, sometimes even just a bad person. The show, however, is not dedicated to diagnosing her; but it cares, rather, about taking her feelings and experiences seriously, which is especially impactful in a show whose premise is focused on society’s tendency to take voyeuristic joy in female pain.
While “I Hate Suzie” had high ratings when it originally premiered in the U.K., the show has never quite found a U.S. audience. HBO Max does not release data on how popular its shows are, but it’s obvious that “I Hate Suzie” never quite picked up the same steam as some of its thematic counterparts — neither receiving the same press attention nor awards nods as, say, “The Queen’s Gambit” or “The Flight Attendant” which were all released around the same time. There has been little talk so far of a second season, which is unfortunate. Not because the story necessarily needs one, but because, without the additional press a second season might bring, it seems possible that, as streaming platforms are over-saturated with content vying for viewer attention, “I Hate Suzie” may drift into irrelevance. “I Hate Suzie” is worth watching, not just because it is good TV, but because TV that takes its female protagonist’s “complicatedness” and humanity seriously in a way other similar shows have sometimes failed to do.
Season One of “I Hate Suzie” is available on HBO Max. The “Hidden Gems” series features Crimson Arts writers weighing in on their favorite under-rated shows and why they’re worth checking out.

Julien Baker’s rapid rise through the ranks of rock raised a question: If writing songs about feeling alone and unloved makes people care after all, what do you write about next? With “Favor,” the third and final single preceding the Feb. 26 release of her album “Little Oblivions,” Baker answers by reminding listeners that feeling lonely doesn’t require being alone.
“Favor,” like almost all of Baker’s songs, offers a glimpse into her experience living with depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Her critically acclaimed sophomore album, “Turn Out the Lights,” left her exposed in the gaping center of cavernous arrangements, choking out devastating lyrics about her mental illness such as “Maybe it’s all gonna turn out all right / And I know that it’s not, but I have to believe that it is” and “The harder I swim, the faster I sink.” Despite lush harmonies and the perennial plucking of clean electric guitars, Baker’s music is raw, visceral. She sings as though her melodies are emotional exfoliants, her heart stinging as she screams out the final notes of each track.
But mournfully bleating “nobody’s worried about me,” as Baker does on the 2017 track “Sour Breath,” would ring false in 2021. Since “Turn Out the Lights,” she has firmly situated herself in the female-driven contemporary rock scene populated by steady beats, pedestrian imagery (with a metaphorical punch), and stories of personal trauma. The self-titled EP “boygenius” from her power trio, in which she sings alongside songstress Lucy Dacus and college-radio royalty Phoebe Bridgers, solidified her status. Baker, a lone wolf by self-definition, is now indisputably part of a sonic community.
Baker’s newfound relationships show in her latest arrangements: “Favor,” like her other recent singles, betrays influence from her “boygenius” collaborators. The doubled melody and thick guitar in the middle of the mix, sometimes obscuring the words? Taken straight from Bridgers. The relentless emphasis on the third beat of every measure? A Dacus staple. And in a literal sense, of course, the band’s back together again in the backing vocals, a substitute fanfare heralding the impact of “boygenius” on Baker’s new batch of solo music in advance of the “Little Oblivions” release.
Baker tackles friendship in the lyrics of “Favor,” too. They describe the way depression distorts interpersonal relationships, sometimes twisting them beyond recognition — but unlike with the bulk of Baker’s previous music, they do not concede those relationships to illness altogether. This time, the unnamed friends love the singer in spite of her problems, so much that they save her from herself: “Who put me in your way to find? / And what right had you not to let me die?” Baker sings, her voice close to collapsing under its own weight. Still, the singer has trouble feeling their care (or they have trouble showing it, depending on whom you listen to). In a particularly striking second-verse image, an unnamed companion rescues a moth from the grill of a truck with what the quietly jealous singer claims is more gentleness than she’s ever known from them: “How come it’s so much easier / With anything less than human / Letting yourself be tender?”
These stories still take listeners to the brink of heartbreak, because four years after “Turn Out the Lights,” Baker’s music is still hurting. Finding a community is far from a cure; that causal chain would be the streamlined stuff of fairytales, and she’s built a career on complications. The solutions proffered in “Favor” are no simpler. For all the talk of tenderness, she later divulges, “If I had my way / I’d have missed you more / Than you missed me.” No one but Baker could use such ordinary language to cut so deep. Amid an osmotically altered soundscape and the wrinkles of new social dynamics, she is the same songwriter: honest, relatable, and unapologetically tangled up in her own trains of thought.

Chloe and Halle Bailey are inseparable in both their sisterhood and their musical partnership as Chloe x Halle. They’ve had a joint Instagram account for their entire career — that is, until now. On Jan. 19, each sister created her own personal social media account because Halle is away in London filming Disney’s upcoming live-action adaptation of “The Little Mermaid.”
This social media split has been accompanied by rumors that the girls might be headed toward solo careers, but the Bailey sisters seem as close and unified as ever. In their post announcing the new personal accounts, the caption reads: “still an ocean even when we are two seas.”
Chloe’s Instagram, in particular, has garnered a lot of attention — and hateful comments. She recently shared videos of her doing the Buss it challenge, lighting sage in her underwear, and partaking in the silhouette challenge, showing off a more skillfully choreographed sensuous dance routine than most other participants. These videos and her somewhat provocative photos seem to showcase a young woman coming into herself and having fun with her womanhood, while exuding vibrant style. But a lot of people have not been so receptive of her newfound self-expression.
She took to Instagram Live to discuss how those negative slut-shaming and body-shaming comments have been affecting her, emphasizing an empowering message: “For every woman out there, don’t change who you are to make society feel comfortable.” She opened up about her challenging journey with self-love and body positivity, the topic of which brought her to tears.
She has always presented herself as a force to be reckoned with: Her signature deep vocals are reminiscent of classic R&B artists, while her dynamic stage presence draws from the energetic performance style of Beyoncé. After all, Queen Bey did discover the Bailey sisters, and they are signed to her label. The good news is that, following the Instagram Live, Chloe was flooded with support and solidarity from her sister, as well as from famous fans like Gabrielle Union and Halle Berry.
Sadly, the hyper-sexualization Chloe has been facing is not dissimilar to the experiences of other Black women in the music industry. So the question is, why are Black women so often vilified and villainized for being unabashedly themselves? Is it because society has a deeply embedded problem with seeing Black women happy, successful, and authentic? The verbal abuse and vitriol thrown at Chloe calls to mind a recent discussion of misogynoir in the music industry and how heavy the effects can be on Black women, who so often bear the brunt of structural sexism.
These are complex matters, but Chloe has made one thing clear: She won’t be letting anyone or anything get in the way of her self-assertion. “Twirl on ‘em haters”: A true student of Beyoncé, she practices what she preaches.

For those who still haven’t quite grasped the rules of football, Super Bowl commercials (and the halftime show, of course) often serve as the primary entertainment of the event. On the biggest night in television, companies pull out all the stops — and this year’s crop of ads certainly did not disappoint. One of the standouts from the night was a Cadillac commercial based on the iconic 1990 Tim Burton film “Edward Scissorhands,” featuring the internet’s darling, Timothée Chalamet, alongside original cast member Winona Ryder.
The commercial opens with Ryder repeating the opening line of the movie, “This is the story of a boy with scissors for hands,” before adding, “No, not that one.” The commercial is set in the present-day, many years after the original, which took place in the 1950s. Ryder’s character Kim Boggs now has a son, Edgar (Chalamet) who has inherited his father’s iconic hands — and the difficulties that come with them. He punctures footballs, gets magnetic objects stuck to him, and cracks his phone screen trying to use it. He even struggles to ride the bus, so his mother gifts him the all-new electric Cadillac, equipped with hands-free driving so that Edgar can ride off into the sunset with ease.
The ad nailed the Tim Burton aesthetic and the nostalgia factor, but the biggest buzz came from Chalamet’s connection to actor Johnny Depp, the original Edward Scissorhands. Chalamet previously dated Lily Rose Depp, the actor’s daughter, and the fact that he was playing tribute to his ex-girlfriend’s father’s role did not escape the notice of fans. And it gets better — Ryder had also dated Johnny Depp for some time, turning the commercial into something resembling a strange meta family drama.
Nevertheless, Chalamet’s pale, emo good looks and innocent, endearing character were a perfect fit for the character of Edgar, leading many fans to call for a Chalamet-helmed remake. The original creator of “Edward Scissorhands,” Tim Burton, reacted to the commercial with delight. “It’s rare when a work you’re proud of continues to live on and evolve with the times, even after 30 years,” he told Vanity Fair. I’m glad to see Edgar coping with the new world! I hope both fans and those being introduced to “Edward Scissorhands” for the first time enjoy it.”
Ryder also gushed over the opportunity to revisit the beloved story and her[ young co-star. “It was a pretty special thing to be able to revisit again,” she told Vanity Fair. Of Chalamet, she said that he was “really the perfect person to embody that character.” It seems the admiration was mutual, as Chalamet told Vogue “working with Winona was a total dream come true.”
Though Johnny Depp is the central figure linking this odd family drama together, he himself did not appear within the commercial’s narrative. The star has been embroiled in a lengthy, complicated domestic abuse court case in which accusations and evidence of abuse from both Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard were shown in court. Though the case has ultimately opened up broader debate, the charges against Depp were found to be true, and he has faced major career consequences, including being dropped from the Fantastic Beasts franchise.

In his latest directorial feature, David Fincher opts for a deceptively simple title that, similar to the film itself, captures the elusive complexity of a towering, fragile mind. Beneath its rich cinematic layers, “Mank” is a meditation on common anxieties: loneliness, moral corruption, the inevitability of change. Set in large part during the Great Depression, the film tracks American screenwriter Herman J. “Mank” Mankiewicz’s race to finish the script of “Citizen Kane” in under 60 days.
Rather than tell a linear story, “Mank” uses frequent flashbacks to portray the titular character’s mounting bitterness toward the movers and shakers of Hollywood. The result is a mosaic of power, vice, and ambition that builds — through the gradual convergence of its many moving parts — to a stunning thesis on art and individualism in a rapidly modernizing world.
With its hefty set pieces and mellow black-and-white aesthetic, Fincher’s film succeeds in resuscitating the kinetic chaos of 1930s Hollywood — glamorous on the outside and festering at its core. Fountains of champagne and gilded menageries belie the darker subtexts of political disinformation, class warfare, and labor exploitation that defined the industry. Structurally and thematically, “Mank,” similar to “Citizen Kane,” harkens back to a time before the pollution of ideals and purpose — before the Great Depression; before the moral disintegration of an industry; and before Mankiewicz’s quietly seething disillusionment with a fast-moving, careless world.
In an attempt to communicate the breadth of his protagonist’s journey, Fincher goes beyond linear storytelling. “Mank” opens with a wounded, alcoholic Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman) bedridden in a cabin surrounded by arid fields. The year is 1940. American film company RKO Pictures has handed Orson Welles a blank check for his new project, and the New York prodigy promptly enlists the help of Mankiewicz, whose sharp tongue and contrarian views have ostracized him from the upper echelons of Hollywood.
From these opening shots, “Mank” travels back in time, gradually uncovering glimpses of the titular protagonist’s fraught past. Stellar performances make possible the ambitious time jumps in the film’s storyline. Equipped with classic glamour and the ghost of a Southern drawl, Amanda Seyfried delivers a convincing portrayal of Marion Davies, an actress whose involvement with newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst (Charles Dance) complicates her enduring friendship with Mankiewicz. Arliss Howard exquisitely embodies the conniving Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer co-founder Louis B. Mayer, whose penchant for faux weeping reveals his manipulative tendencies.
It is impossible to wrest “Mank” from its historical moment. In the 1930s, Hollywood — much like the rest of the nation — buckled under the clash between capitalism and socialism, between a blithe aristocracy and an indignant working class. The Great Depression left the future of film tarnished, confused. This tension crystallized in the 1934 California gubernatorial election between Democrat and author of “The Jungle” Upton Sinclair and Republican candidate Frank Merriam. Incensed by the moral complacency of Mayer and his colleagues, Mankiewicz gambles on the outcome of the election, siding with Sinclair. Film editor Kirk Baxter’s precise manipulation of pace renders Mayer’s election party, which Mankiewicz reluctantly attends, a stunning viewing experience. The time between shots becomes shorter and more erratic, as though mimicking shallow breaths or a quickening heartbeat. A hypnotic montage of champagne, dancing, and shuttering cameras — symbolic of Hollywood elites’ vulgar excess during a time of national destitution — seals Merriam’s victory.
Technically dense sequences like Mayer’s election party are memorable, but the film’s most artful moments lie in glimpses of Mankiewicz's understated vulnerability — a subtlety reinforced by Oldman’s towering performance. As he drafts his script beside secretary Rita Alexander (Lily Collins), an exasperated Mankiewicz bemoans, “None of its sings. None of it. Not a note.” Mankiewicz’s acerbic wit often masks his crippling self-doubt and intermittent suicidal ideation. Occasionally, however, Fincher illuminates his protagonist’s inner agitation. In a brief yet powerful exchange with his brother Joe (Tom Pelphrey), Mankiewicz despairs over his slow progress with his screenplay, to which Joe responds, “It’s the best thing you’ve ever written.” Oldman’s subtle grimace following Joe’s encouragement conveys layers of emotion — melancholy, gratitude, and grief.
At its best, “Mank” is a cohesive amalgam of seeming opposites: excess and destitution, personal ideals and institutional corruption, private grief and public victories. Through this dual focus, Fincher’s film succeeds in depicting a flawed artist’s labored efforts to make sense of his complicated desires — of what he demands of the world and, in turn, what the world demands of him.

Theaters around the country may be closed, but the switch from the stage to the computer screen hasn’t hindered the Hub Theatre Company of Boston, which is preparing for a virtual production of the new play “Solitaire Suite.” Written by Trent England and directed by Daniel Bourque, the play streams live on Feb. 20, 26, and 27 at 7:30 p.m. and on Feb. 21 at 4 p.m.
Described on Hub’s website as “The Twilight Zone meets Zoom,” the show follows Celeste, Pete, and their son Tiger on an ominous drive through the countryside that will ultimately change their lives. Producing artistic director Lauren Elias, who co-founded the Hub with John Geoffrion in 2012, hopes that the production’s themes will resonate with audiences during these unstable times. “What I love is that in this play, Celeste is really able to point to that moment,” she said: “the ‘point of no return.’ I think as we come up on the one-year anniversary of the pandemic, everyone can sort of point to that last normal day they had.”
For playwright England, these connections are a bittersweet coincidence, as “Solitaire Suite” was written early last year before the pandemic. “Celeste, she’s increasingly alone due to external circumstances, and that just kind of happens to be how we all live now,” he said. “A lot of us are surrounded by family or roommates and we’re kind of around people all the time, but we increasingly are feeling kind of lonely.”
For the actors, who double as their own set, costume, and lighting designers due to the remote process, the virtual nature of the show has produced a unique set of benefits and challenges. “It’s an extra exercise in imagination,” Marty Mason, who portrays Celeste, said. “I’m turning and talking to my wall and then I’m pretending there’s a person there. It’s kind of neat to stretch yourself in that way.”
Still, Mason said she misses the rehearsal room when working on virtual theater projects. Michael Lin, who plays Tiger, agreed. “I think a lot of people underestimate the way that physical space and interaction helps with the sense memory of a performance,” he said. “Feeding off of energy and off of proximity with your fellow actors is something that’s terribly missing from the medium.” As director, Bourque also faces new challenges, like achieving a cohesive aesthetic or allowing two actors to speak at the same time.
The “Solitaire Suite” team is overcoming the hurdles of remote performance through creative uses of technology, such as a program that allows them to manipulate each actor’s box. “I take great pride in the fact that I think people are gonna be surprised with the showmanship of it,” Elias said.
Cristhian Mancinas García, who portrays Pete and created the artwork for “Solitaire Suite,” believes that streaming allows productions to maintain the excitement of live theater in a virtual setting. “It’s live theater, so you don’t know what’s gonna happen every night. It could be that we forget a line or it could be that the internet connection folds,” he said. “That’s just another layer of the beauty of live theater.”
In addition, virtual performance allows Hub’s work to reach a wider audience, supporting Elias’ original goal for the company: to make theater more accessible. Hub’s last online show, “Much Ado About Nothing,” saw people tune in from remote locations such as London and Nigeria. The “Solitaire Suite” team hopes that trend will continue. “It’s going global without actually having to pack a suitcase!” Elias said.
Despite the difficulties, the atmosphere among the cast and crew in advance of opening night was full of excitement. “The general level of professionalism for this production has been really amazing.” Mason said. “We’re doing theater. It’s really happening.”

“I am art, that’s who I am.”
Situated underneath the green vines in her dorm room with a smile and a Zoom filter, multidisciplinary artist Uzo L. Ngwu ’23 seems to personify creativity. A student in the dual-degree program through Harvard and the Berklee College of Music, Ngwu’s hope for a better world emanates from the myriad artistic disciplines she’s mastered, from filmmaking to animation to music.
While Ngwu had always been drawn to creative pursuits, she only recently began to view the arts as something capable of holding her full attention. Unlike her older sister, who had been focused on improving her craft since their early childhood days, Ngwu took a bit longer to develop that confidence.
“I was so convinced that art was something [I] could only pursue on the side,” Ngwu said.
After buying an iPad last year, Ngwu was constantly finding new ways to bring her artistic visions to life. From digital art to illustration, filmmaking, animation, music, and acting, Ngwu shifts smoothly between a variety of media.
“When I see something visually pleasing, I think, I want to illustrate that. If I think of a story, I think… I want to animate that,” Ngwu said.
As for the world Ngwu chooses to showcase: It is unapologetically Afro-centric. With most of her digital illustrations centered around Black women and other women of color, Ngwu’s work creates a space of representation for identities often disregarded in the art world.
But when asked why she chooses to focus on women of color, Ngwu pushed back, saying this was a question she received frequently.
“White artists are never asked how their whiteness informs their art… and they never get interrogated on that...I’m black and I want to see myself in art so I create a world that I want to see,” Ngwu said.
More than creating representation, Ngwu captures the beauty and joy within the Black community.
“Blackness and Black people and Black culture and Black art is just so vibrant and beautiful,” said Ngwu. “The world moves because of Black culture and Black creativity and Black art so it only makes sense that that informs the art that I make and that inspires the art that I make.”
Luckily for the world, Ngwu is at no loss for inspiration. After consistently posting on her art Instagram for over a year, she has amassed nearly 8,000 followers, some of whom are fairly big names in the creative industry. From a Creative Director at MTV to an Oscar-winning film director, it’s safe to say that her social media accounts are gaining valuable exposure — and she doesn’t plan on stopping any time soon.
“I told myself prior to 2021 that this was going to be a year of creative abundance, and so far it’s proven true,” Ngwu said.
As of mid-February, Ngwu had already surpassed her 2021 aspirations of working with a major company. She was recently commissioned by Freeform’s “Grown-ish” to create art for the new season, and also by MTV to draw portraits of Black artists for Black History Month. Ngwu’s 2021 is definitely off to an amazing start.
But Ngwu’s current accomplishments are, evidently, just the start of an ambitious artistic career. As she tries to ride out the momentum she’s created, Ngwu looks forward to “setting up the foundation for a career in freelance illustration work and hopefully a career in freelance animation work.”
Ngwu described herself as a “multi-hyphenate, Cambridge and Minneapolis-based creative,” and it is clear that art will continue to inform her future for years to come.
“Art is such an important part of how I view the world and how I navigate the world. I could not imagine my life if I was not an artist,” Ngwu said.
Just as Ngwu cannot imagine her world without art, it’s becoming increasingly harder to picture art without Uzo L. Ngwu ’23. With 2 more MTV portraits coming out later this month and another exciting project in the works, the world patiently waits to see what Ngwu shares next.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Feb. 6, 2021, FX and Hulu premiered the sixth installment of their series of standalone documentaries “The New York Times Presents.” The unauthorized documentary titled “Framing Britney Spears” is an hour-long deep-dive into Britney J. Spears’ mistreatment by the media and conservatorship battle with her father Jamie Spears. In addition to providing a thorough summary of the popstar’s life and the events that led to her many achievements — and obstacles — the episode’s primary focus is on Spears’ ongoing strive for autonomy. It leads viewers on her journey to reclaim a self-image that the press so abrasively tries to corrupt over the years. It is about her struggle to be accepted into society while the world frantically obsesses over sexualizing her instead of focusing on her success, a familiar feeling for many women.
Now, you may be wondering what a conservatorship is, and you’re not alone; even her former assistant Felicia Culotta is quoted in the documentary admitting:​ “to be honest, I didn’t then, nor do I now understand what a conservatorship is,” so don’t feel too bad. The National Family Caregiver Alliance describes a conservatorship as “​when someone is no longer competent to manage his or her own affairs and is no longer able to delegate someone to do it for him/her, a conservator can make the necessary decisions.​ ”
In Spears’ case, an instance of hospitalization in 2008 led to the courts granting temporary and later permanent conservatorship over her life, with her father being appointed the conservator of her estate — and her person. He oversees every large decision in her life, including her medical records and whether or not to send her on tour. In other words, Jamie Spears practically owns his daughter.
Watching the documentary, I discovered an upsetting component to the story: Spears never wanted her father to be the conservator, as the documentary notes at the end. The decision, too, was made by her father.
Despite being a lifelong Spears fan myself, I will confess that I had absolutely no idea that any of this “conservatorship” business was happening. I mean, I understood the lyrics of her hit single “Piece of Me,”​ in which she calls the media out for depicting her so unfairly and — like the badass she is — tells them to bite her. I at least thought I knew about the extent to which she struggled against tabloids hyper-focusing on her life and career. But, to my mind, she had been doing okay since the height of that tension. Was she not just a judge on the “X-Factor” a few years ago? She seemed to be an ordinary popstar doing ordinary popstar things. Why would someone need legal ownership of what appears to be a person fully capable of managing her own life?
Just last year, I came across her more recent content on Instagram and TikTok. Her posts were entertaining, to say the least, and at first glance they appear to be harmless and quirky. But, after hearing about and researching the #FreeBritney Movement, I too became fascinated by what appear to be cryptic messages signaling a desire for freedom and help. Suddenly, I began to understand why the world seemed so alarmed by Spears’ situation.
The media had become such a strong, militant presence in her life during the height of her stardom that it harassed her to a point of no control. Time and time again, they painted her to be the cheater, the unfit mother, the promiscuous and oversexualized young-girl who needs to be restrained. And the craziest thing? Soon, her monetary value became her sole identity in the eyes of the media. The paparazzi was financially dependent on Britney, practically begging: “​gimme gimme more, gimme MORE.​”
Although Spears is no longer begging hordes of paparazzi to give her a few inches of space in public settings, she is still fighting for her voice to be heard in her conservatorship. Because of his allegedly intense and unwanted control over Britney’s life, I firmly believe that her father is no different from the suffocating media, as neither one of them wanted Spears to put her foot down and claim her voice.
Now, I may not be a top-charting popstar with a multimillionaire estate and several bodyguards surrounding me 24/7, but on some level, I understand what it is like to be in Spears’ shoes. As women, we constantly feel like we are battling the greater force of a patriarchal society that functions to tear us down. It demands that we look or act a certain way in order to fit a specific image of how men expect us to behave. When we refuse to accept that notion, we are deemed “crazy,” “unstable,” or “too-aggressive.”
Of course Spears’ situation is very unique, and I am in no position to compare my life to the intricacy of hers. However, the common ground between Spears and a lot of her fans, particularly young girls and women, is this desire to fit into the world that ceaselessly clashes against craving the freedom to truly express ourselves outside of the male gaze.
In “Framing Britney Spears,” New York Times critic Wesley Morris responds to Spears’ absolutely iconic 2007 head-shaving moment by proclaiming “she’s saying, essentially with no hair, I​ quit,”​ leaving the old Spears in a pile of hair at the salon. To this day, I view this moment as a symbolic revolt against the institution of misogyny and its authority in popular culture and mainstream media: her shaved head is one of the biggest middle fingers to the patriarchy of the 21st century! With this glorious new shine radiating off of her scalp, Spears takes ownership of her image and sexuality, saying, literally, “I don’t want anybody touching me. I’m tired of everybody touching me.” The media sought so desperately to spread a specific image of her, not only as a mother, but as a woman, and she simply said she doesn’t want it anymore.
In essence, what the documentary captures is that every girl lives in her own microcosm of Britney Spears’ ongoing fight for freedom. Her war against hordes of men with cameras waiting to get the perfect picture, as well as an opposing father, is merely an amplification of any woman's grapple with embracing their womanhood in a man’s world, making the realities of womanhood impossible to deny. We can see ourselves in the woman who made the impulsive decision to shave off her hair or the woman potentially begging for a way out via social media. After getting a sense of the complexity of her life, I can only hope that Britney is soon granted the autonomy that every girl wishes to have over her own body.
#FreeBritney.

On “If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed,” his second full length collaboration with producer Big Ghost LTD., Buffalo rapper and founding member of Griselda Records Conway the Machine continues to carry the torch of classic, throwback rap into the modern era. Supported by stellar beat-making from Big Ghost LTD., the album stands tall among the Griselda catalogue and sees Conway in peak lyrical form.
Conway and the rest of the Griselda lineup have been on a hot streak — releasing nine projects in 2020 among the five official members — with no end in sight. 2021 will mark the fulfilment of Griselda’s contract with Eminem’s Shady Records following the 2020 release of “Who Made the Sunshine” from Griselda Records president Westside Gunn and upcoming Conway record “God Don’t Make Mistakes,” which is rumored to drop at the end of February. Yet, free agency seems to suit the Griselda outfit best. “From King to a God,” Conway’s last album, which was jointly published by the rapper’s own label DrumWork Music Group and EMPIRE, earned him a spot on the Billboard 200. “If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed,” is a comparatively small-time project, available exclusively on Bandcamp, that nonetheless matches the quality of any high-profile Griselda release.
Big Ghost LTD.’s production showcases stellar vocal sampling and guitar loops, which perfectly support Conway’s paced delivery. “Commencement,” the album’s spoken word intro featuring Lukey Cage, sets the tone with a moody electric guitar riff that acts as the creeping engine for the beat. On “Way We Move” and “Highly Praised,” the producer shows off his sampling skills — looping harmonized gospel samples over minimal drums — to create a warm soundscape that expertly envelopes Conway’s laid back flow. The last track, “Forever Ago,” combines the guitar motifs set up in the intro with the vocal sampling used in the body of the album in a luscious culmination, making it the best beat on the project.
Big Ghost LTD. shows artistic improvement and growth, especially in his sampling, from the duo’s last full length outing, “No One Mourns The Wicked,” which was released in 2020. Conway, who regularly works with big name beatmakers like The Alchemist and Griselda in-house man Daringer, acknowledges the chemistry he has with Big Ghost LTD. on “Way We Move,” comparing them to the legendary 90s duo Gang Starr made up of rapper Guru and producer DJ Premier: “Me and Ghost like the new Guru and Preem.”
Throughout the project, Conway’s lyricism is infectiously confident, speaking on his influence in the rap game and owning his success. On “J Batters,” he addresses the resurgence of throwback hip-hop spearheaded by Griselda over the past couple years: “Ask your guys, the Machine the n**** responsible for keeping grimey rap alive.” Conway and Griselda’s presence in rap is undeniable having garnered co-signs from the Wu-Tang Clan, Jay-Z, Busta Rhymes, Eminem and the late MF Doom. On “Toast,” Conway raps about his ascension to the A-list of hip-hop, which has placed him within striking distance of all-time greats like Lauryn Hill: “Miseducation when I push the foreign, only shit this missing is a hook from Lauryn.” The five features on the album are well placed, serving to complement Conway’s lyrical prowess without ever overshadowing it.
For all the time Conway spends flexing, the rapper takes equal space to unpack his emotions and personal struggles. While at the peak of his career, Conway has experienced considerable hardship during the pandemic. Westside Gunn, Conway’s brother, was hospitalized last summer due to complications from Covid-19. Conway’s cousin Benny the Butcher was shot in the leg in Houston during a robbery attempt last fall. On “Losses to Blessings,” Conway opens up about his grief surrounding the death of his friend and longtime Griselda producer DJ Shay who passed away from Covid-19 last year: “Man, I done lost Shay, I’m feelin’ lost lately.” With the album closer, “Forever Ago,” Conway acknowledges his own mortality and expresses his desire to provide for his family: “I compartmentalize, I never try to find closure / I wanna see my family straight before my eyes closin’.” Combined with the vocal samples and guitar loops from Big Ghost LTD., Conway’s stream-of-consciousness delivery informs the raw emotion behind his words.
Only thirty minutes in length, “If It Bleeds It Can Be Killed” is a short and sweet offering from Conway with some of his sharpest lyricism to date. The project ranks in the top tier of Big Ghost LTD.’s extensive catalog, which includes collaborations with Ghostface Killah, Wale, and rising D.C. MC Ankhlejohn. With his major label debut “God Don’t Make Mistakes'' set to drop via Shady Records in the coming months, Conway the Machine has set himself up nicely for another year of rap domination.

Is love enough? Writer-director Rohena Gera’s heart-piercing film “Sir” examines this question by exploring the possibility of love across class in contemporary Indian society. Set in Mumbai, the film follows the unlikely love story of Ratna (Tillotama Shome), an in-house servant, and Ashwin (Vivek Gomber), her wealthy architect employer. In using the delicacy of forbidden love as a lens to view class divide, “Sir“ not only reveals the intrinsically alienating nature of the class system, but also forces us to reckon with our own complicity in propagating such a social structure. From the moody cinematography to the sharp editing, the film shines — largely due to Gera’s sensitive writing and the fully-realized acting performances.
Gera’s story stands out because it breaks away from the mostly gimmicky template of a rich-boy-poor-girl love story. Too often, love stories so focused on class divides are either presented as highly exploitative or unrealistically simplistic, but thankfully, Gera isn’t interested in either extreme. In fact, Gera treats Ratna and Ashwin’s love story no differently than the story of any other sincere couple who first develop respect and admiration for one another, then love. It is perhaps in doing exactly that, that this film reveals the hardship class divides pose at every stage of love. For example, the first time Ashwin aimlessly calls Ratna purely out of longing for her, we realize that even private moments cannot escape the deeply internalized class structure. Though Ratna realizes what the call means as she pauses for a moment, she cannot help but ask “Kuch kaam tha kya?” (Did you need something?). Similarly, at one point, Ratna is elated that Ashwin chooses to wear a shirt she handmade for him, but asks him to not tell anyone that she made the shirt. Their worlds are barely allowed to collide in material exchanges, let alone romantic ones. It’s these sorts of subtle moments throughout the film that underscore the difficulty of love across class barriers, but also question the larger inhumanness of this stratification that we have so easily adapted to.
While Gera’s writing confronts us with these issues, she never judges any of her characters. Whether it is Ashwin’s friend telling Ashwin that he can’t date his maid or Ratna’s friend Laxmi continuing to work at her employer’s place despite being abused, Gera empathizes with everyone. To her, everyone’s livelihood and imagination are equally caged by the class system.
One of the film’s most interesting subthemes is the way class colonizes ambition. For example, when Ratna first tells Ashwin that she wants to be a fashion designer, Ashwin doubts her, to which Ratna simply asks “Nahi Ban Sakti Kya?” (Can I not be one?). Ashwin’s intervention, though not malicious, showcases how class limits our conception of dreams, even for the most progressive of minds. While “Sir” makes us aware of these boundaries, it doesn’t lack hope. Ratna’s character, in fact, is an embodiment of the optimism to break out of one’s circumstances. In addition to working at Ashwin’s place, she takes up tailoring courses on the side and eventually lands a job in fashion designing.
Elevating Gera’s writing are the vulnerable portrayals of Ratna and Ashwin. Gomber brings a sense of brokenness and earnestness to Ashwin. His best moment in the film comes when he finally acts on his frustration and asks Ratna if she would ever be with him. Some of Shome’s most striking moments, however, are ones where she is by herself. For example, in the scene where she rushes to answer Ashwin’s phone call, she fixes her saree as if she’s meeting him in person. And, needless to say, both Gomber and Shome create an irresistible chemistry together that draws on silences and expressions more than actions and words.
Finally, the film ends with Ratna calling Ashwin by his name for the first time, not “Sir.” And while this hopeful note of reciprocity is uplifting, it’s worth noting that this is how most love stories would start — a reminder, perhaps, of how far we have to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a Feb. 6 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” host Dan Levy of “Schitt’s Creek” fame invited indie rock artist Phoebe Bridgers to perform the final number off her recent album, “I Know the End.” The camera panned and the lights dimmed, leaving a red spotlight on the singer-songwriter and mirroring the cover of her quadruple Grammy-nominated album, 2020’s “Punisher.”
Earlier that night, she had performed her hit song “Kyoto” from that same album, wearing her iconic skeleton onesie alongside her bandmates. For “I Know the End,” Bridgers was outfitted in a beautiful pearl-embellished ribcage piece. The harness and her platinum blonde hair reflecting the red light created an ethereal setting for what was to become one of the most awesome and memorable SNL musical performances in recent memory.
Two-thirds of the way into the performance, Bridgers and fellow musician Harrison Whitford, both on guitar, synced into an electric duet, marking the song's evolution into mesmerizing chaos. Bridgers then screamed into the mic, the audience cheering and trumpets blaring, and in proper grand finale fashion, smashed a Danelectro guitar into a fake sound monitor. Every moment of the song had been building up to this point, upon which expectations were blown into sparks, quite literally. Ultimately, it was not the guitar or sparking monitor that caught fire, but the internet.
Bridgers, 26, is a Los Angeles born-and-raised artist who made her first major mark upon the release of her first studio album, 2017’s “Stranger in the Alps.” Her sophomore album “Punisher” once again proved Bridgers’ sheer talent and artistry. Bridgers’ songs are captivating and raw, exploring trauma in ways one might be too hesitant to explore on their own. In a recent interview with MTV news correspondent Dometi Pongo, Bridgers said, “I feel like if I didn’t write about personal stuff, I would be robbing myself of the experience of talking with fans with mirrored experiences.”
Bridgers’ performance on SNL was breathtaking, even past both visual and sonic levels, yet another example of how her music addresses such complex truths of life, and how effortlessly Bridgers elicits an emotional response from her audience. Still, some viewers did not see her performance this way.
One viewer stoked a fire on Twitter after writing “Why did this woman, Phoebe Bridgers, destroy her guitar on SNL? I mean, I didn't care much for the song either, but that seemed extra.”
However, it was David Crosby, co-founder of The Byrds and one third of the folk trio Crosby, Stills & Nash, who injected the most visible criticism of Bridgers’ performance. When asked by a fan on Twitter what he thought of her guitar smashing, he wrote “Pathetic,” to which Bridgers simply responded “little bitch.”
Many supporters came to Bridgers’ defense, poking fun at the unnecessary controversy and echoing Bridgers’ own witty and blunt internet presence. Founder of the Foo Fighters and former Nirvana drummer David Grohl offered his support of Bridgers, saying that his days in Nirvana were filled with drums with holes in them: “It was every fucking night,” he said on “The Howard Stern Show,” On Instagram, Bridgers said “got some really great feedback from my performance ! next time I’ll just burn it and it will be more expensive.”
Although Crosby later explained that he condemns all guitar smashing, this “controversy” calls attention to the double standard for women-identifying artists. Was Crosby actually concerned with the preservation of guitars, as they are “for making music… not stupidly bashing them on a fake monitor for childish stage drama,” or was he disturbed by a female rock artist joining in on the fun and subverting expectations, as others have claimed?
There is clearly a double standard for women to perform neatly and at the service and comfort of men — that much is obvious. But, the criticism Bridgers received for doing a popular rock show tactic also comes to show how society infantilizes and restricts the artistic freedom of women.
Rock and roll is a genre often defined by the aesthetic of excess, of high volumes and high times. If rock and roll had a rule, it would likely be that there are no rules. Clearly, the internet’s criticism of Bridgers’ performance goes beyond a worry for wasted materials like a guitar and a useless sound monitor, but from covert misogyny and infantilization, seeing women as objects to control and groom. In the music industry, women are treated as lacking some sort of knowledge that male artists inherently possess.
Was Bridgers really being immature or was she displaying her genius? It might be easy to write Bridgers’ music off as too sad and cynical, but what comes with her diligent crafting of every lyric, chord progression, and song composition is an intricate view into the human condition.
In her performance of “I Know the End,” Bridgers invites us into the liminal space of a post-death, non-reality state (see: ghost costumes, skeleton motifs, and her description of her music as “silly death”). The guitar smashing represents a subsequent return back to the visceral sadness of life’s realities in a raging outcry. This duality is best illustrated by the tender hug Bridgers shared with her bassist, Emily Retsas, seconds after Bridgers’ intense guitar smash. Maybe there is no line between dreams and reality, between life and death, between love and loss. With this dissection, it is hard to name even a few artists willing to explore these harrowing truisms like Bridgers seems to do so naturally — that our existence is inevitably painful and angry and joyful and beautiful.
And thus, the controversy over a smashed guitar comes to die. As abstract artist Ad Reinhart put it in his book “Art as Art,” “art is art-as-art and everything else is everything else… art is not what art is not.” If so, may art be imagined, created, and consumed in spaces of freedom and resistance, not in spaces of comfort for old men. And as she should, Bridgers’ had the last word on this matter, writing on Twitter, “I can’t believe I am the first woman ever.”

For 21-year-old singer-songwriter Ayoni, identifying as an artist is so much more than the music itself. It requires personal and public identities, past and future selves, all intertwining to create what she refers to as a “state of aspiration.” Following the release of her new single “The Patriots,” Ayoni, who is currently a student at USC, shared her perspective as a young artist in L.A. and some of the intricacies of her creative process with The Harvard Crimson. In her conscious construction of sound and image as an artist, Ayoni finds a balance between creative freedom and the responsibilities inherent to storytelling.
Though her music carries a variety of influences, from R&B and soul to folk and indie, Ayoni is careful not to define herself within any specific category. “I think I have consciously decided to be genreless, if that makes sense,” she says. “Like I think being, or landing, in a genre for me has never been something I’ve recognized or striven towards. I feel like I have always kind of just created songs and just focused on the story… I know a lot of artists who have done the genre thing, but it gets very restrictive, and the future I see for myself is so limitless and so, just free-flowing.”
Indeed, Ayoni’s songs exist in the space between personal experience and societal context, lending a dual sense of intimacy and universality to the stories she tells. The first track of her EP “Iridescent,” titled “Wife You Up,” was written in direct response to an unsettling misogynistic encounter during a day trip with a friend in L.A, and her lyricism here carries a sense of clear intent: “I’m iridescent, can’t you see,” she says in the bridge, before following it up a few lines later with “We’re iridescent, can’t you see.” “The Patriots,” her newest single, references police brutality through different lenses of identity, moving from “Your knee upon my neck” to “The knees upon our necks.”
On how she navigates the responsibilities of using her voice for the marginalized and underrepresented, Ayoni says, “It’s very rare that we have the chance to center ourselves and give our own narratives. I think for myself, the best way that I can navigate that is to focus on my experience in the current times, as opposed to trying to make a statement for all people that are Black, or all people that are of color, or all people that are women.”
Returning to “Iridescent” as a whole, the EP explores themes of love, femininity, and coming-of-age over the course of eight songs, each one retaining its own distinct sound while building upon a narrative held together by the warm resonance of Ayoni’s voice. Subtle instrumentals and bass ground the melody but are never overpowering, with runs in particular displaying her stunning technical range: Clear-toned high notes transition organically into rich, reverberant low notes, each key and register sharing the same raw authenticity.
Paralleling her music in complexity, craft, and soul are her visual covers, designed in collaboration with creatives Caleb Griffin and Domia Edwards. In discussing their significance, Ayoni says, “I want my image to cut through in the same way that my music does, and so I think a lot of our approach for getting that layered richness to our art is really taking the time to figure out what the intention is… what do we want people to feel?”
She credits Griffin and Edwards’ influences in reorienting her approach. “Up until now, I had been so thoughtful about the future, and, you know, timelessness, but I think there’s also such value in understanding history and understanding the works that have come before you in the art world,” she says. In particular, “The Patriots” takes inspiration from a series of works by photographer Carrie Mae Weems depicting the narratives of Black Americans in the media.
At the end of the interview, Ayoni also shares that she’s currently working on a full-length album. “Iridescent was more of like a chronology, an understanding of what it took to arrive at myself, to move out and become a person, it was a very coming-of-age exploration,” she says. As for what she has planned ahead? “It’s a little bit more about me and the world, about creating a cohesive planet for my sound,” she says. “It’s my first album, so I just hope that people like it.”

Vampire Weekend may have wondered “what day demands a date” on their 2019 album “Father of the Bride,” but the group’s latest project shows a different level of attention to timing. When the New York-based indie rockers commissioned two covers of the “Father of the Bride” co-lead single “2021” from saxophonist Sam Gendel and jam band Goose, their only requirement was that each one last exactly 20 minutes and 21 seconds. In a math operation strangely fitting for a song about the passage of time, doubling this duration gives the resulting EP’s name: “40:42.”
In just over a minute and a half, the original “2021” layers two nearly identical verses sung an octave apart, a brisk guitar solo, and the recurring word “boy” over a bright synth sample from Haruomi Hosono’s “Talking.” Vampire Weekend lead vocalist Ezra Koenig’s architectural metaphors provide a concise framework for his questions about the future: “2021, will you think about us? / Copper goes green, steel beams go rust.” Each half of “40:42” develops the source material into a sweeping musical journey with improvisatory wonder. Thankfully, neither is in a hurry.
The start of Gendel’s version, “2021 (in the space between two pieces of wood),” instills Hosono’s initially upbeat motif, composed as background music for Muji stores, with elegiac solemnity by transposing it down a half step and stretching out the beats. As the gradual introduction of harmonies adds complexity, echoing vocals and scattered percussion contribute to Gendel’s reflective vision. After the second verse, sundry electronic warbles solidify into a more metrical sequence. The cover modulates to the original key somewhere along the way, marking its return with fluid saxophone phrases and unaltered excerpts from “Talking.” A sharp jumble of vocal chops builds to an equally sudden silence. The track’s finale samples a video of drummer Bernard Purdie demonstrating his signature beat, the brilliantly syncopated Purdie Shuffle, whose iconic triplet rhythm leads “2021 (in the space between two pieces of wood)” to a jubilant, jazzy ending.
Maintaining a steady tempo all the way through, Goose’s cover embodies the precision of its title, “2021 (January 5, to be exact).” After a brief acoustic intro, guitarist Rick Mitarotonda brings earnest clarity to the lead vocals. The refrain of “boy” loses some of its percussive edge, turning into a softly resonant pedal tone that often lingers in the background. Just before the halfway point, the emergence of a straightforward major scale from the quintet’s intricate improvisation becomes one of the track’s most striking moments. As the last extended instrumental idea tapers off, shimmering wind chimes herald the reappearance of Hosono’s opening theme, which keyboardist Peter Anspach reinterprets with wistful composure.
For Vampire Weekend, rekindling interest in “2021” obviously makes sense now. But they wanted “40:42” to do more than point out the arrival of the song’s namesake year. “We hope these 40 minutes and 42 seconds of music will provide some peaceful, vibey atmosphere as we all move through 2021,” the band wrote on Instagram.
The EP’s surges of dissonance don’t always make for the most soothing listen, and both covers necessarily sacrifice the brevity that so cleanly concentrates the bittersweet yearning of “2021.” But in doing so, they allow the music to unfold at a deliberate pace, encouraging listeners to consider how Gendel and Goose enrich Vampire Weekend’s original message. Gendel leaps between vastly different concepts in relentless forward motion, while the repeating verses that bookend Goose’s cover suggest a more cyclical progression of time.
Their inventive takes on “2021” also succeed as fairly literal examples of artistry thriving in the face of this year’s limitations. “2021, will you think about me?” the song begins. Even as “40:42” asks the same question, it leaves little doubt that the answer is yes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We’re gonna do a song for you called ‘So Far Away.’”
A third of the way through Carole King’s 1971 concert on the BBC for her sophomore album “Tapestry,” She smiles on the pause, punctuates a chuckle just shy of the microphone, and closes her eyes.
How to sum up fifty years?
Let the piano tell it. That instrument, invented circa 1700, lasted two hundred and seventy-one years until Carole King came along to sit there and flip it around just so.
It was made to support that voice. Those extremes of volume, that high note that wavers on the edge of breaking the microphone and the booth (or the track entire), and then the drop into softness that takes the whole band with it — that’s her. King’s phrasing opens up space between how the feeling feels and how one says it. She renders it a bit ghostly. It’s in that way, in her liveness, she always veers a hair off the beat; the whole song could go under if she let it.
She doesn’t talk much of herself except to laud her band and gesture at her audience. Women in the crowd are shadowed in blue, with that ‘70s-folk-mom look, boot-cut jeans and sunglasses in tow. Blues runs underneath the music they hear and through its chords; folk whistles in its lyrics — the simplest things veil the most tightly latticed architecture. It’s these elemental considerations which carried King’s oeuvre far and have been masterfully riffed-upon: Aretha Franklin’s “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" and The Shirelles’ “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” are oft-cited permutations (and so grandiose — those soul-track strings!) of King’s work, which took public recognition along with her four Grammys in 1971 and her netting of that tricky trophy called Album of the Year.
King at the time was barely thirty. This is an album made under ‘70s conditions — of disco, Nixon’s antagonisms, new supposed post-civil rights legal freedoms — to loosen up time, put on some free-flowing clothes and sway at home or the piano bar down the way. She gives the people a full silk alchemy on the songs, lets them know what she does.
Anything that becomes a de facto greatest-hits album, as “Tapestry” is, tells on itself: Audiences and critics, upon its blazing success, rush to justify the sudden ascendancy as anything other than lightning luck. Expectations and refutations fly about, often untethered from craft, but in this BBC performance King proves why she made it work: It’s easy. In a 2018 interview at the Library of Congress, she detailed the album’s recording, “I could play comfortably in any level of light as long as I could see the piano keys and the lyrics. We often cut three tracks in a session. The whole album took three weeks to record and mix.”
These songs, recorded briskly, squeeze into them much longer time. “You’ve Got a Friend” (one of the sweetest rock-back-and-forth songs ever put to record) convinced its listener of the candor while the song rolled on and the wanting distance between friends collapsed. “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” was an argument, a plea to reframe how one conceives the temporality of love (and communicating it) entirely. On “I Feel the Earth Move,” she projected the soul-stirring element of her project (“I feel the sky tumbling down”) up into a calamitous, towering plane. This is no small task. One can feel the tug of these demands pulling on the music: That’s why at first, it might surprise a listener that something so gentle can get so heady, bowl one over, sound so unendurably thick. Striving to organize all this into the form of an album is surely tough, diffuse work — of course, until you get there.
“Way Over Yonder'' is the only time in the show King is onstage with a woman. King is in pink with a pendant around her neck; Abigale Haness beside her in a lavender blue. In perfect vocal sync they sway in and out, over the black open-back grand piano. One can locate that invisible yet knowing ease, or at least an imitation of it, in the pantheon of balladists who’ve come after, from Amy Winehouse to Mariah Carey to Roberta Flack. It binds them together.
At the penultimate mark of the performance, “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” opens a tunnel into “Up On The Roof.” King jockeys the band from one song to the next to demonstrate how love pulls you in its vicinity, how it is mostly the heightened flow of one discordant encounter into the next. Love is the bridge and the passenger. There are plenty ways to fall into closeness with King: One can see her on Broadway, buy her vinyls, fall into the frenzy of admiration she’s bunched up and brought to her feet. And it’s all to capture her sensibility, to feel how it strokes and whistles and hums, to imagine you are there with her. Think of a remote place with crickets in the country air, sweat lacing your face in beads, and King ending the last song with her head up, opening her mouth to softly chuckle, in glimmering surprise, at how beautiful, how lucky it is, that you came to see her: you and yours and all those who snuck in behind. You’ll never leave, you don’t have to — but when you do, you’ll be better. King can do this anywhere. She can make you feel, even if it’s just her, you got one now — a forever friend, a good one. You're in awe, or rather beyond it, of how someone can be alive in quite this way.
On “Home Again,” one of the album’s only songs left out of the BBC show, King ponders — and the line is so sharp, so moved, it feels like the holding in of fifty years of breath — “Sometimes I wonder if I’m ever gonna make it home again.” So exhale; get close. Wonder no more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christopher Plummer, who passed away on Feb. 5 at the age of 91 built an acting career that spanned more than half a century and a legacy that will last at least as long. He got his start on Broadway in roles such as Hamlet and Macbeth, but transitioned to Hollywood in the ‘60s and has stayed booked and busy ever since. He’s been involved with so many successful projects that it is difficult to choose a starting point to dive into his career. Here are five films to watch that showcase Plummer’s wide range, from children’s animation to biopic thrillers:
5. “The Sound of Music,” Dir. Robert Wise (1965)
This timeless musical was critical in the trajectory of Christopher Plummer’s prolific career. He plays the no-nonsense Captain Von Trapp opposite Julie Andrews’ whimsical and wonderful nun Maria. Plummer himself wasn’t the film’s biggest fan — he even claimed to avoid the TV every Christmas season to steer clear of it — but still couldn’t deny that the well-made film brought pleasure to many. “The Sound of Music” is sure to bring a smile to your face and leave you with a happy tune inside your head.
4. “Up,” Dir. Pete Docter (2009)
Plummer rises to the challenge of voice-acting in this uplifting Pixar tale about a man who floats his house into the air with balloons. He voices the once-great adventurer Charles Muntz opposite the film’s protagonists, and displays an incredible range of emotion, even in animation. Despite the movie’s bright colors and at-times silly premise, Plummer’s washed-up explorer becomes a genuinely scary villain, and his defeat helps bring the story to an all-the-more-satisfying conclusion. This is a great one to watch with the whole family, or for anyone who needs a pick-me-up.
3. “All the Money in the World,” Dir. Ridley Scott (2017) 
This fast-paced and compelling thriller stars Plummer as billionaire J. Paul Getty, whose grandson is kidnapped and held for ransom. The film is at times heavy-handed in expressing its message about the emotional burden of wealth, but Michelle Williams knocks it out of the park as Getty’s focused and frustrated daughter-in-law. Plummer’s performance is great in its own right, but becomes an even more powerful testament to his acting prowess when one realizes that he filmed all his scenes in only nine days — he was a last-minute replacement for Kevin Spacey’s character.
2. “Knives Out” Dir. Rian Johnson (2019)
Christopher Plummer plays Harlan Thrombey, a murder mystery writer with tricks up every sleeve and in every corner of his Clue-inspired house. His character lies at the center of a twisted mystery that’s as compelling to watch the first time as it is the tenth. Plummer leads a star-studded cast including Daniel Craig, Toni Collette, and Jamie Lee Curtis, and every actor holds their own and brings their all. The character is also a great homage to one of Plummer’s earlier iconic performances as Sherlock Holmes in the 1979 film “Murder by Decree.”
1. “Beginners” Dir. by Mike Mills (2010)
One of Christopher Plummer’s most well-known roles is in this 2010 tragic comedy. He plays Hal, a dying gay man who’s spent his life in the closet. After receiving a cancer diagnosis late in life, Plummer’s character commits to finding joy, falling in love, and celebrating in the time he has left. The film focuses on Hal’s son, played by Ewan McGregor, as he tries to find new love without letting go of the memories of his father. Ultimately, this is a film about finding love wherever possible. It’s about celebrating a life, even while dying or grieving, and watching “Beginners” is the perfect way to honor and remember a wonderful actor’s life, career, and impact. Plummer won an Oscar for this role as Best Supporting Actor, becoming the oldest person to do so at the age of 82. More than a decade later, his performance is still outstanding.

Before there was “Raised by Wolves,” there was Ridley Scott’s “Prometheus.” Of course, before “Prometheus,” there was “Alien,” the seminal body-horror thriller in which the iconic Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and a group of unlucky astronauts face off against bloodthirsty extraterrestrials. The extensive “Alien” cinematic universe, unfolding through decades of filmmaking, focuses on the conflict between humans, the aforementioned evil aliens, and Engineers (technologically advanced ancestors of humans), tracing the downfall of humanity to the battle between species. Yet with “Raised by Wolves,” Scott and his contemporaries put forth a new, fresh vision of a future in space — one which continues to probe questions of ethics, religion, artificial intelligence, and survival in nuanced ways but departs from Scott’s highly influential space franchise.
From its first episode, “Raised by Wolves” is bizarre, stark, and engaging, with cold visuals reminiscent of “Westworld” and spacecraft-espionage intrigue recalling “Battlestar Galactica.” The show opens on two anthropomorphic androids — aptly named Mother and Father — who are sent with six human embryos to a hostile planewhere they are supposed to start a human colony and birth a new society. It is tough, painful going for Mother, Father, and their children, who are not left alone in the new landscape for long. As the story unfolds and they fight to survive, we see they are still affected by the religious civil war which tore Earth apart. As the conflict lands on the new planet, the show interrogates the way we understand, talk about, and spread religions, presenting an existential conflict between a restrictive but mostly humane religious sect and the cutthroat, calculating atheist androids.
Of course, while the show delves into deep philosophical questions, it’s also just a roller-coaster ride of wild technology, terrifying robots, reimaginings of genre tropes, and ridiculous sci-fi costumes. Plus there are people falling into terrifying geothermal holes, a pair of all-powerful eyes that are kept in a bag, cool plastic surgery robots, and captivating performances by Amanda Collin (Mother) and Abubakar Salim (Father.) It’s “Alien” meets “Westworld” meets “Battlestar Galactica,” with a hint of “Game of Thrones” — not great for a mindless binge-watch, but perfect escapism, cerebral and fantastic in equal measure.
“Raised by Wolves,” created by Aaron Guzikowski with Scott attached as an executive producer and director of several episodes, premiered on Sept. 3. on HBO Max. The show seems to have benefitted from word-of-mouth hype on a wider scale, as its ratings climbed throughout its first season. Despite this success, the show still seems to be mostly missing from conversations about the year’s best and most interesting TV— from its absence in yearly rankings to minimal media commentary and zero Golden Globe nominations. Yet “Raised by Wolves” offers nuanced, useful explorations of social issues and conflicts, and deserves recognition for the innovative work it’s doing to examine human nature through a novel sci-fi premise.
Season One of “Raised by Wolves” is available on HBO Max. The “Hidden Gems” series features Crimson Arts writers weighing in on their favorite under-rated shows and why they’re worth checking out.

In recent years, the true crime genre has taken off in the mainstream mediascape, and Netflix has jumped on this bandwagon. Joe Berlinger’s “Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel” is the first season of Netflix’s newest anthology series, which investigates a different mystery each season. The first four-episode installment tells the story of the 2013 disappearance and death of Elisa Lam, as well as the hotel in which she died. While there are many pieces of true crime media that are entirely respectful to the memories of the victims, “Crime Scene” crosses this line from the onset by stoking conspiracy.
The Cecil Hotel plays as important a role in this season as Lam herself. The Cecil was notoriously home to more than one serial killer, numerous murders, and countless suicides, and the most interesting parts of “Crime Scene'' detail how the hotel’s neighborhood, Los Angeles’s Skid Row, was created by the systematic oppression of the homeless population. The show describes how the air of death and misfortune surrounding the Cecil made it a morbid tourist attraction and led many people to speculate it was haunted or cursed. The story of Elisa Lam only furthered this theory.
Lam was a 21 year old Canadian college student who disappeared after checking into the Stay On Main hotel, which was housed within the Cecil but had been renamed to avoid the controversy. Hotel staff then found the now viral surveillance footage of Lam in the hotel elevator, and the Los Angeles Police Department released the footage online leading a flood of internet sleuths to get involved. Nineteen days after her disappearance, Lam’s body was found in the hotel’s water tank.
Lam’s battles with mental health and her history of not taking her medication create a clear image of her death. But amateur investigators on social media refused to accept mental health as the solution, for many reasons. Perhaps because mental health, bipolar disorder, and their complexity are widely misunderstood in pop culture; perhaps the thought of mental health, an integral part of human existence, contributing to an accidental death is harder to accept than a sensationalized murder story. Regardless, this conspiratorial attitude is nothing if not disrespectful to the Lam family, the people who worked hard to investigate her death, and Elisa herself.
The series leverages the internet fame of the case to turn Lam’s tragic death into a ghost story. There is no mystery left here, there are no murderers lurking in the shadows, the case is closed — but Netflix and Berlinger decided to pry it open with conspiracy theories. They draw a crowd in with a famous story, and they take advantage of the manufactured mystery to fill out four episodes. Most of the series was spent discussing the ideas of these internet personalities who “investigated” her death and the odd coincidences surrounding it, which not only gives credence to their outlandish stories, but mars Lam’s memory.
The docuseries places these sleuths on a pedestal as noble crusaders for justice, despite the fact that they not only failed to help the investigation, but perpetuated extreme cyberbullying[, and that likely caused more pain for her family. Everyone likes to hear stories of the average person being a hero, achieving the glory of a real-life detective without a lot of the work, but not every story is that satisfying.
While most of the internet personalities featured in the series seemed to have good intentions, many of the people involved in this case online only thought they did. They bullied a Mexican death metal singer to near death due to his coincidental links to the case, and they still tarnish the names of the detectives and the hotel staff to this day. Elisa Lam is more commonly known as the victim of a suspicious death or unsolved murder, rather than of a tragic accident and complex health issues. Too often are the mysteries of her case reported without the accompanying explanations or corrections. If her bipolar disorder was discussed more often and more legitimately, it would likely serve to educate the average true crime fan of the potential severity. At the end of the final episode, the featured sleuths do admit to taking the theories too far and being wrong, but the series fails to effectively discuss the effects and dangers of these conspiracies.
People may have felt like they knew Elisa from reading her extensive Tumblr posts, but the majority of “Crime Scene”’s audience had never met her. Theorists expressed an intense sense of entitlement to information about Lam’s private life. But her family are the only people entitled to the private details and outcome of this investigation, and if they have closure on her death, it doesn’t matter if anyone else does. This series is another reminder of how conspiratorial the public is and how the internet fosters these theories. Unfortunately, this series did little to comment on or condemn this behaviour, ultimately further disrespecting the life and memory of Elisa Lam.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall 2019 semester, I was arrested at the Harvard-Yale football game for protesting both universities’ investments in fossil fuel companies. I tell you this not to be another voice calling on Harvard to divest (which they still should and must do), but to confess something more personal: I’m a hypocrite. After I was arrested next to a banner that read "Nobody wins. Yale and Harvard are complicit in climate injustice," I invested in fossil fuels. While Harvard has been complicit in climate injustice, I must confess, so have I.
Here’s how it happened. Last winter, like many young people barraged by stories about “Unleashing the power of compound interest by investing early,” and finding myself fortunate enough to have a full-time job, I decided it was time to start saving a little bit for retirement. After minimal thought, I bought shares in a Vanguard fund called VTI that tracks the entire U.S. stock market. I certainly wasn’t alone. VTI and other index funds have been lauded for democratizing diversified portfolios, making investing less risky, and reducing the cost of entry for small-scale investors. Today, Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index Fund, which includes VTI, holds more than $1 trillion in assets. Looking back, given how much of the economy VTI covers, it seems exceptionally careless that I didn’t investigate further. I didn’t really care for analyzing my investments. I wanted to deposit some money, forget about it, and hope that in 50 years compound interest would work in my favor.
Last month I thought about my own complicity while hearing the moving words of Harvard’s own Amanda S. C. Gorman ’20. At President Joe Biden’s inauguration, she said, “We will not be turned around / or interrupted by intimidation / because we know our inaction and inertia / will be the inheritance of the next generation.” At first, I felt pride, thinking of how we stood up to Harvard, refusing to turn around or be intimidated by the police as they arrested us, knowing that our inaction would be inherited.
But this pride quickly became personal embarrassment. I was the inaction. I was the inertia. I investigated and found that as of today, VTI holds $5.4 billion in ExxonMobil, $4.6 billion in Chevron, $4.5 Billion in Nextera Energy, and $2.0 billion in Duke Energy Corp. All of these holdings harm our collective future. We know that divestment is effective at fighting climate change because it materially harms fossil fuel companies; even Shell admits that. And the right thing for Harvard to do is also the right thing for all of us to do. Yet here I was holding fossil fuel shares.
Looking back, my conviction that we have a moral imperative to disobey laws when necessary in order to protest large-scale injustices blinded me to an equally important imperative: putting your money where your mouth is. From a practical standpoint, we single out holders of concentrated financial power because pressuring them is the most efficient and effective way at realizing change. This makes sense when 55 percent of Americans invest in the stock market but the corporate power imbalance is so severe that in the near future twelve individuals will likely have decision-making power over most U.S. public companies. Clearly, fighting climate catastrophe necessitates large-scale pressure against massive financial institutions and billionaire investors like Harvard — but they’re also much easier to point fingers at. It can seem like smaller, personal investments don’t need as much scrutiny. Perhaps that feeling is why Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index Fund holds 24 times as much money as Harvard, but I gave Vanguard my money and called on Harvard to divest.
For too long, I’ve worked to criticize the investment practices of large institutions like Harvard without holding myself accountable. We must investigate our own practices, not just those of our institutions. For a criticism to stick, it must be universal. For the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers to be compelled to take immediate action to divest from climate-destroying companies, we must not only disrupt, like we did at the Harvard-Yale game, but must also show them that their shame is our shame, that we will not profit from destruction and neither should they, that morality requires the same for them as it does for us.
I realize that not many of us are in a position to invest, particularly in the depths of an economic crisis. Nonetheless, in a country where everyone is largely on their own to provide for a secure old age, we will all need to think about saving for retirement, and as we are often told, the sooner the better. If you do invest, take the time to make sure that you do not invest in fossil fuels.
Now, in the process of divesting myself, I can once again call on Harvard. It’s time to divest.

When I was walking back from Trader Joe’s on a late Sunday afternoon, I saw the usual suspects splayed over the Anderson Memorial Bridge admiring the sunset: couples walking their dogs, college students taking pictures for Instagram, large groups of runners. I wasn’t going to stop because I’d seen the sunset dozens of times (and my paper bag of mostly Pirouline cookies was getting heavy), but the sight of something unexpected made me slow my march.
An older man was standing hand-in-hand with a younger woman on the bridge. I didn’t think much of them at first, but I became increasingly aware that I was noticing them over the other couples. Was it their lavish style of dress, the shiny Hermès belt, the printed Burberry scarf, the leather gloves?
As I continued my hurried walk, desperate to get my grocery store goodies safe and sound to my Canaday dorm room, I kept mulling over my own reaction. I didn’t know anything about that couple and had no reason to notice their pairing over the others, but I did.
When I got to my dorm, I recalled the many times in high school my friends and I spent circled around lunch tables, half-joking about the possibility of joining websites like Seeking Arrangement or Miss Travel. We were, of course, giggling among ourselves over the possibility of signing up for sugar daddy websites. I had no reason to think the couple I saw on the bridge was in a similar arrangement, but seeing their pairing drew up memories of this frequent high school discussion. We often marveled at the possibility of absolving ourselves of future student debt while getting a few luxury items thrown in the mix — all for the price of companionship.
Sitting in my dorm room while munching Pirouline cookies alone, I was left wondering whether our glamorization of the sugar baby relationship was wrong. We didn’t strictly see ourselves as glamorizing these relationships. If anything, we thought we had a heightened respect for the sugar daddy complex: How feminist of us to support other women who took advantage of every opportunity, sticking it to the man for the sake of advancing herself. But my immediate reaction to the idea of sugar-babying, like many people, was coarse surprise creeping into judgment.
Why do we stigmatize these relationships? Even I, someone who considers herself a feminist, find myself thrown off-kilter at the idea of a sugar daddy. Now, as a student figuring out how to finance college like 42 million other Americans, I am left wondering why we immediately dismiss these relationships with judgment, shock, and revulsion. After all, my friends and I don’t honestly consider these websites — we, too, hide a similar disdain for sugar baby relationships behind a facade of woke-ness.
Perhaps we stigmatize these relationships because we conflate the idea of the sugar babying with prostitution. Though not explicitly paid arrangements for sex, some of these relationships involve varying degrees of physical exchanges. Fundamentally, however, the sugar baby-sugar daddy structure distinguishes itself from other relationship models through the transactional exchange of money and gifts for companionship. Seeking Arrangement, for example, allows users to define their own terms on what they expect from the relationship. “Sugaring” shouldn’t be associated with sex work.
Why should this concept be strange? We pay people — therapists, notably — to talk to us about our problems and help maintain our mental health. Why do we consider the acceptance of money for companionship, essentially conversations and time, as inappropriate?
Another element of our stigmatization results from our disdain for materialism. Certainly, if we paid our therapists in Hermès belts or Gucci loafers, we would judge these women less. Sugar daddies, however, don’t exclusively pay their babies in gifts, as many of these relationships involve allowances. In any case, there is no reason to dole judgment for a practice akin to our normalized use of therapists.
We don’t need more reasons to judge young women for their decisions. In fact, we should turn our discussion on sugaring away from solely analyzing the woman to including the man as well. If a woman is to be looked on with disapproval for accepting a Louis Vuitton scarf in exchange for a two-hour dinner date, indeed, something must be said for the man purchasing the scarf and paying for the dinner.
Though sugaring is based on the exchange of companionship, it still purports to reduce the woman to an object — otherwise, the age differences wouldn’t exist. The sugar daddy’s pursuit of a sugar baby can be driven by a desire for youth, which is a physical and not personal aspect of the sugar baby. Signing up to be a sugar baby is not accepting a man’s sexualization. It is, fundamentally, a clever means for women to refute the same system that perpetuates catcalling, unwarranted, explicit private messages, and harassment by demanding payment. We need to stop judging women for how they choose to spend their time and with whom they spend it.
I am still troubled by the fact that I noticed the couple on the bridge in the first place. I have long since finished eating my Pirouline cookies, but now I must contend with my own unconscious judgments — and so must we all.

The Ivy League will not hold a spring sports season, the Ivy League presidents announced Thursday, nearly one year after the conference first canceled athletics competition as a result of the coronavirus crisis.
The League presidents wrote in a joint statement that their decision to cancel athletics is consistent with various measures imposed by their universities to protect the health of affiliates.
“The public health measures now in effect at all Ivy League universities have been carefully designed to support our teaching and research missions while keeping our students, faculty, staff and neighboring communities safe,” they wrote. “In the Ivy League, these measures must apply equally to our athletics programs along with other academic and co-curricular activities.”
Though the League will not sponsor a full-fledged athletics season, it may allow member universities to participate in “local non-conference competition,” provided the public health crisis “substantially” improves and play adheres to institutional Covid-19 policies, including travel restrictions.
Harvard student athletes living on campus are currently allowed to participate in sport-specific training limited by social distancing and group size under Phase I of Harvard’s plan to reintroduce athletics on campus. If Harvard Athletics enters Phase IV, which coincides with relaxed university restrictions on travel, athletes would be able to partake in “limited, outdoor, local non-conference competition,” per an Ivy League Q&A.
Director of Harvard Athletics Erin McDermott wrote in an email to student athletes Thursday that though the League canceled the official spring season, it has outlined a path forward for competition.
“We are all hopeful for better conditions and days ahead. For now, we will continue to train as able with those of you on campus, and allow time to tell whether any competition occurs,” McDermott wrote. “This itself is progress, as it acknowledges that conditions are beginning to show a path forward for future competition.”
Thursday’s announcement marks the fourth athletics season the Ivy League has canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic, which forced Harvard and other universities to send their students home in March 2020.
Recognizing senior athletes will have missed out on their final seasons of collegiate athletics, the Ivy League issued a waiver last week lifting its ban on graduate student competition in League athletics. The waiver only applies to athletes who graduate this spring.
McDermott also wrote in her email to athletes that University President Lawrence S. Bacow will meet with Harvard student athletes virtually next week to offer more insight into the League’s decision to cancel sports and its plans for fall 2021.
The Ivy League presidents wrote in their statement Thursday that their decision to cancel athletics was not made lightly.
“As campus and community leaders, we believe that our public health responsibilities and educational principles preclude us from sponsoring Ivy League athletics competition this spring,” the presidents wrote. “We regret the many sacrifices that have been required in response to the pandemic, and we appreciate the resilience of our student-athletes, coaches and staff in the face of adversity during this difficult and unusual year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I feel like a caveman,” said Alexander D. “Alex” Kontoyiannis ’23, describing his experience studying for his organic chemistry midterm Tuesday night.
“My room was pitch black, and I was just hunched over my desk with nothing but a flashlight, trying to look at my paper,” he said.
Kontoyiannis — along with millions of other Americans — was left without power this week as a severe winter storm pummeled pockets of the United States, leaving at least 47 dead.
Though the storm has caused power outages in multiple states, Texas experienced the most expansive power outages — in part due to the state’s unique self-reliant energy grid.
While most states have power grids that connect across several states to allow for a communal energy supply, Texas’s power grid lies mostly within its own borders. As unprecedented glacial temperatures fell upon Texas this week, the state’s non-winterized power supply succumbed to the frosty weather. As of Wednesday morning, 3.4 million homes were without electricity, and more than 200,000 remained powerless early Friday morning.
Though Harvard students in Texas — many enrolled but living at home due to the coronavirus pandemic — said they stocked up on food and water ahead of the wintry weather, some said they did not anticipate the severity of the winter storm.
“Eventually we [saw] how serious it was getting. It wasn’t just people playing in the snow and being cute anymore. It got to the point where there were people dying from freezing to death,” said Ngoc T.H. “Tram” Nguyen ’22, who is currently residing in Austin.
“Other folks are being displaced from their homes because they are without power and running water. And then homes are flooding as well from poor infrastructure,” she continued. “It seems like it’s not getting any better.”
Vivien L. Tran ’22, who is from Massachusetts but living in Austin, said she did not anticipate the debilitating effects of the storm.
“I just thought it was gonna be a snowstorm. I didn’t consider that Texas didn’t have the infrastructure or the capacity to deal with three inches of snow,” said Tran, a former Crimson Arts editor. “Everything is just closed, except for major grocery stores that are only allowing 10 people in at a time.”
“It kind of reminded me of the beginning of the pandemic, and it took us by surprise,” she added.
Austin resident Sarida I. Morejon ’23 said she felt “unprepared” for the storm since she has never had to plan for such severe winter weather.
“I’ve never seen this much snow, I’ve never seen this much ice,” Morejon said. “I don’t think any of us really thought ahead in terms of, ‘Oh, we should like let the faucets drip so that our pipes don’t freeze,’ or ‘We should charge up all of our devices, in case the power goes out.’”
Other undergraduates said they had to contend with food and water shortages.
“We’ve sort of been rationing our food, not quite getting by on what we can scrounge from local convenience stores that are open for a couple hours,” said Benjamin E. “Ben” Schwartz ’23, who is living with friends in Austin this semester. “Food’s running a bit low, but I’m confident things will reopen tomorrow or Friday.”
Morejon said she and her friends had to “figure out” how to ration water.
“We had to figure out what we were going to do in terms of rationing what we had,” Morejon said. “We walked to CVS in the morning on Monday through the ice and snow — and it was so, so cold — to buy like 10 gallons of water to use for the next few days. But gradually our water’s been coming back.”
Some Harvard undergraduates living in Texas said their academics have been disrupted by the power outages, water shortages, and freezing temperatures caused by the snowstorm.
Molly M. Martinez ’22, who is from Dallas, said she had to relocate to a friend’s apartment to complete her coursework after her house lost power and heat.
“We ended up having to leave our home because it got way too cold, and we have no power or heat or anything. They had pretty stable power, and I had WiFi for classes,” Martinez said.
“It was definitely very, very difficult — because you’re in such a crowded situation — to be able to complete my schoolwork, complete classes,” she added. “I didn’t really have my working environment anymore.”
Nguyen said navigating classwork during the storm has been “very difficult.”
“I really took for granted the power of WiFi and internet, and have been trying to use my hotspot,” Nguyen said. “The cell towers are down too, so my LTE doesn’t work. Navigating school is really difficult.”
Others said their House administrators and professors have been “very supportive” throughout the week.
“I’m in Winthrop House and our dean, [Resident] Dean [Linda] Chavers, actually reached out to the professors of all the classes of students who are in Texas recently, just to let them know about the situation,” said Payton F. J. Kim ’23, a resident of Houston. “[The professors] who I’ve talked to have been very supportive and accommodating.”
Martinez, who belongs to Adams House, said the outreach from her House deans made her feel “very supported.”
"My dean reached out to me today,” she said. “It’s been nice knowing that, as I reach out to my professors about different things, I have the support of my deans, as well, already. They’ve been super, super kind and super accommodating.”
Some students expressed frustration with the lack of government preparation for battling snowstorms.
“The authorities in Texas were clearly caught with their pants down,” Schwartz said, “I don’t get how that’s possible seeing as they knew the storm was coming for a week.”
Kim said there could have been “more storm preparedness.”
“In Texas, we get hurricanes a lot, which we prepare a lot for,” she said. “We kind of had not taken winter weather seriously just because we didn’t know how serious it could be without power and without water.”
Martinez added that Texas residents turned to community organizers for assistance during the storm due to the government’s failures.
“Nobody was expecting this breakdown of state infrastructure and the lack of resources provided by the government,” she said. “A lot of the work that’s being done is through mutual aid, through community organizing, and things like that to really work through the community and help people.”
Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Nguyen said she noted a “huge disparity” in the experiences of those living in lower income areas compared to more affluent areas.
“We’ve seen just like a huge disparity in how different neighborhoods are treated in situations like this, where you see power outages in a lower income, more marginalized communities compared to areas that are richer and wealthier,” Nguyen said.
“You see pictures of the Austin skyline still lit while the rest of the city was just dark,” she added. “It’s a very stark contrast.”

Harvard astrophysicists proposed a new model showing that the Chicxulub impactor — the celestial body responsible for the mass extinction of the dinosaurs — could have been of cometary, rather than asteroidal origin, in a study published in Scientific Reports on Monday.
Co-authored by undergraduate Astrophysics student Amir Siraj ’21 and Astronomy professor Abraham “Avi” Loeb, the study proposes that the Chicxulub impactor is a fragment of a long-period comet — a comet with an orbital period longer than 200 years — that broke off during a journey close to the Sun and struck the Earth.
“The solar system sort of acts like a pinball machine, in which Jupiter, the most massive planet, kicks incoming long period comets into orbits that bring them very close to the Sun,” Siraj said. “What happens is the portion of the comet closer to the Sun feels a stronger gravitational pull than the part that’s further, resulting in a tidal force across the object, and this can break up comets into many smaller pieces.”
Though the hypothesis diverges from the popular theory that the impactor was instead an asteroid, the newly proposed model fits the data better than previous models, according to Siraj.
Siraj said though statistical analysis shows that Chicxulub-sized asteroids are “slightly” more likely to impact the Earth than similarly sized comets are, both populations have such “extremely low” rates of impact that one would expect such an event to happen “once every few billion years” — a calculation inconsistent with the age of Chicxulub, which struck the earth only 66 million years ago.
“This ‘fragment of a comet’ model sort of flips that on its head because we’re showing that we can actually produce a rate that would be consistent with the impactor without invoking either of these populations, and rather produce it through this dynamical channel that actually produces the right number and the right rate of Chicxulub-size fragments,” Siraj said.
Key evidence for the long-favored asteroidal theory includes high iridium concentrations in the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary — the band of sedimentary rock taken to mark the dinosaur mass extinction event — as asteroids typically contain more iridium than comets, according to a 2013 paper by Dartmouth Earth Sciences professor Mukul Sharma and University of New Mexico professor Jason R. Moore.
In their research, Sharma and colleagues found that iridium levels at the locations scientists had been probing were “anomalously” high as compared to the overall region. This finding weakened the reigning argument for asteroids, and made space for the comet theory to be considered seriously. It wasn’t a far-fetched idea: according to Sharma, comets — although less massive than asteroids — are capable of reaching high enough speeds to be consistent with the energy of the impactor.
“We came up with the conclusion that it had to be a fast-moving object — a comet — that was responsible for creating this very large impact structure,” Sharma said.
This recent study strengthens their argument by demonstrating that there was a “viable scenario” in which the Chicxulub impactor was a comet, according to Loeb.
“We have a model — the only model that was proposed in the context of comets,” Loeb said.
Loeb went on to say that, before either theory can be refuted, it would be necessary to find a “smoking gun” — for example, by calculating where the impactor’s fragments landed or identifying “telltale signatures” that distinguish between asteroids and comets of carbonaceous composition.
According to Siraj, he never set out to stake a position in the Chicxulub debate.
“I had no idea this would ever connect to Chicxulub, or ever lead to a new theory on the origin of Chicxulub,” he said. “This sort of just stemmed from playing around with some simulations I had built to try and understand the behavior of long period comets better.”
“That’s a trait of a discovery very often,” Loeb said. “You do something else and suddenly you realize, ‘Oh wow, it could explain something.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Gender Inclusive Mapping Project, a group backed by multiple Harvard offices, plans to design a web-based app to help members of the Harvard community easily locate gender inclusive restrooms.
The group aims to protect transgender, gender nonbinary, and gender nonconforming people, who may avoid using public restrooms for fear of discrimination and harassment. The app will provide information on restroom access that users can view discreetly.
The initiative is working in partnership with the Office of the President and Provost, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Title IX Office, the Medical School, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the College, the Divinity School, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Harvard Planning Office, and more.
Caysie C. Harvey, co-chair of the team and the University’s Associate Title IX coordinator, said that the project “sought to ensure that all Harvard community members, including those who are transgender, gender nonbinary, and gender nonconforming, have accurate and inclusive means of locating restrooms at Harvard.”
In 2016, a gender neutral bathroom sign was damaged and defaced with sexist and transphobic graffiti. Around two months later, the College announced that it will outfit all 12 of its residential houses with gender neutral bathrooms by the conclusion of its ongoing house renewal project.
The mapping project has four working groups: signage, inventory, mapping technology, and promotion and communication.
The signage working group took a look at all existing signage at Harvard and its peer institutions, held focus groups to hear affiliates’ goals for the project, and drafted a recommendation. The inventory working group took stock of all previously existing inclusive restrooms, and also identified plausible spaces for supplemental gender-inclusive restrooms.
Meanwhile, the mapping technologies working group analyzed current mapping of inclusive restrooms, solicited feedback from affiliates, and determined the most effective mapping technology for the project. As the project leadership reviews the mapping technology group’s recommendations and coordinates with the Harvard Planning Office, the promotion and communication team will spearhead a public awareness campaign.
Harvey said that the project has been a community-driven effort to make Harvard more inclusive.
“We continue to be heartened by the enthusiasm of local building managers who assisted in confirming the accuracy of our data. It was genuinely a community-wide effort grounded by our collective responsibility to promote inclusivity,” Harvey said. “This project is meant to be iterative and a community-wide collaboration, as there are updates made to restrooms across campus, we will continue to partner with building managers to update our Gender Inclusive Restroom Mapping site.”
The online interactive map will be launched by this Spring for members of the Harvard community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite reductions in campus greenhouse gas emissions, Harvard failed to meet 2020 waste and water reduction goals set forth by the University’s 2014 Sustainability Plan.
The plan — introduced by former University President Drew G. Faust — set forth 12 goals, commitments, and standards to be met by 2020 aimed at reconfiguring campus operations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve resources, and promote “health and well-being.”
The University achieved most of its 2020 pledges, including several before the deadline. The Green Restaurant Association awarded each of the 13 undergraduate dining halls operated by Harvard University Dining Services a two or three star certification for sustainability in 2014. In 2016, the League of American Cyclists designated Harvard as a gold-level “Bike Friendly University.”
But the University fell short of its target to reduce waste per capita by 50 percent from a 2006 baseline, despite initial progress. Trash decreased by 32 percent and total discards fell by 22 percent, according to the Harvard Sustainability Office’s open data portal.
“I think that that’s an area where we set a goal that was more aspirational, and there’s more work to be done,” Heather A. Henriksen, the managing director of Harvard’s Office for Sustainability, said in an interview last week.
“One of the challenges there is actually just getting great data — and data from the vendors — which is an industry-related challenge,” Henriksen added.
By the end of 2017, Harvard had reduced its total trash to 302 pounds per capita — a decrease of around 44 percent from 2006 — but total trash increased over the subsequent two years.
“Waste is always challenging,” said Julian Dautremont, the director of programs at the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education.
“You can change your electric supplier, you can put solar panels on building rooftops and these kinds of things, and it doesn’t need everybody on campus to participate,” he said. “Every person is creating waste, to some extent. And it’s harder to change on a systemic level.”
The University also undershot its target for a 30 percent decrease in water usage on campus from a 2006 baseline. A “known infrastructure break” in 2019 resulted in a significant increase in water consumption, according to the Sustainability Office’s 2019 annual report. But water usage in 2018 — which sat at a 24 percent reduction from 2006 and a 2 percent increase from the previous year — still fell short of the goal.
“We always want to be really transparent and report what the actuals were, but there is a story behind it,” Henriksen said. “Past years, again, were between 24 and 26 percent reduction from 2006.”
Like waste reduction targets, Dautremont said that water reduction can be difficult because of the collective buy-in it requires from everyone on campus.
“You can change the showerheads, but you can’t really change how long people choose to shower,” he said.
While the University struggled with waste and water usage, it exceeded its goal to maintain at least 75 percent of landscaped areas with organic landscaping, according to Henriksen. Harvard has also successfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions from 2006, though emissions reductions have leveled off since 2016.
Back in 2016, Harvard achieved its goal to reduce school-wide emissions by 30 percent from a 2006 baseline.
Henriksen, who has been Harvard’s chief sustainability officer since 2008, said she is “very confident” the school is on track to meet its goal to be fossil fuel-neutral by 2026. Neutrality, she said, is “a bridging strategy” to be fossil-fuel free by 2050 — a goal set in 2018.
“They’ve helped push the field forward,” Dautremont said of Harvard. “That’s, I think, appropriate, given the amount of resources that Harvard has to invest in sustainability. We kind of need them to be a leader in this area.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bioengineering professor Kevin K. “Kit” Parker wrote in a statement to The Crimson Thursday that he plans to teach a course on data analysis and policing strategy in fall 2021, despite cancelling the course this semester after student backlash.
In the statement, Parker — a professor at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences — said he is continuing the research that he planned to conduct in the class on the Springfield, Mass. police department, and criticized Harvard students who pushed for the course’s cancellation in late January.
Parker’s course Engineering Sciences 298R: “Data Fusion in Complex Systems: A Case Study” would have enabled SEAS graduate students to use data analytics to study how the Springfield Police Department deploys Counter-Criminal Continuum policing, or C3 — a law enforcement strategy — in the city’s North End neighborhood. C3 was developed by a friend of Parker’s and is based on United States Army Special Forces counterinsurgency tactics.
Shortly after a student petition calling for the class’s termination garnered more than 500 signatories – including nearly a dozen current or former Springfield residents – SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III announced in a Jan. 25 email that the course would not be offered this spring.
Doyle added in the email that SEAS would convene a review of its course approval process.
The petitioners criticized the class for researching a policing strategy they believe normalizes the “militarization of society,” while also failing to acknowledge the effects of “structural racism” in the police.
Parker wrote on Thursday that his project takes a “holistic approach” to analyze the effectiveness of C3, using data related to crime, education, housing, and youth engagement.
He added his research project extends well beyond the course, but that discontinuing the class this semester was a “tragedy” since it deprived students of the opportunity to “apply their analytical skills to a real world data set derived from an emergent societal issue.”
Parker stood by his decision to move forward with the project, claiming the students were making unfounded assumptions “without ever having spent time in the North End” — where Parker attends weekly meetings with residents. He added that the reaction from students “doesn’t reflect honorably on Harvard at all.”
“The explosion of misinformation about the course and the implied threats against the students who would enroll are inconsistent with the expected code of conduct in the community of scholars,” he wrote.
Neal A. Boyd, a bishop in the North End, said he believes much of the strong reaction from students came from “reacting to what they see around the country” rather than C3 policing in the North End.
Boyd said, though the policing strategy is utilized by the Springfield Police, C3 policing is “totally separate” from the police division itself because of the emphasis it places on community involvement. He also noted that Parker does not receive compensation for his work.
“They help us statistically in our neighborhood, to help people see the change,” Boyd said, referring to Parker and his students.
“It would have been to Harvard’s advantage to take this positive story,” Boyd added. “People who instigated this — I feel bad for them, because they got wrong information, wherever they got it from.”
Graduate student Avriel C. Epps-Darling, one of the organizers of the petition, wrote in an email Thursday that authors of the petition had corresponded with multiple North End residents who were in favor of canceling the course but did not want to come forward for fear of police retaliation.
North End resident Jose Claudio, who was involved in setting up Springfield’s C3 program in 2009, said the military origins of C3 have been taken out of proportion. He argued that C3 has increased the amount of businesses, affordable housing, investment in schools, and infrastructure in Springfield over the last decade, while also reducing crime.
Claudio said C3 had allowed Springfield to raise money to install “ShotSpotters” — devices that alert police of nearby gunshots — around the North End neighborhood.
Claudio added that the controversy surrounding the class would “not really” influence Parker’s research project or C3 methods in Springfield.
In a Jan. 28 Zoom meeting with North End residents, Parker divulged more details surrounding the controversy with the class.
Parker said at the meeting that the Harvard Committee on the Use of Human Subjects, the University’s Institutional Review Board, had approved his project.
“All of my team went through training on ethics and training for dealing with human subjects in an ethical manner,” Parker said.
Responding to student criticism that he, a professor who specializes in tissue engineering, did not have suitable expertise in criminal justice or data analytics, Parker said at the meeting that he was slated to co-teach the course with a data science instructor.
Without mentioning the instructor’s name, Parker said the instructor backed out of the class as a result of the controversy. In Parker’s initial Jan. 22 email announcing the course, Harvard Institute for Applied Computational Science lecturer Pavlos Protopapas was listed on course staff. Protopapas did not respond to a request for comment.
Parker also told the meeting attendees that he had suggested the decision to not hold the spring iteration of the class himself and apologized to North End residents for the controversy.
“I’m so sorry this has happened and that your community might be misportrayed,” Parker said. “I apologize, I apologize on behalf of Harvard.”
Despite the controversy, Doyle — the SEAS Dean — said in an interview with The Crimson Thursday that he still values addressing “charged topics” that can arise out of technological development and present important ethical questions.
“As engineers, we’re not immune to some of the charged topics that might show up in our curriculum, show up in our research, that might be the traditional domain of other areas,” he said.
In his emailed statement, Parker argued that limiting research and teaching to only topics that “wouldn’t upset anyone” is a “fool’s errand.”
“If we are pushing the frontiers of knowledge at Harvard, if we are daring to innovate, we are going to risk comfort and failure,” Parker wrote. “If you are comfortable at Harvard, you probably aren’t doing it right.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As questions arise over funding for the Massachusetts Turnpike project in Allston, state officials and local residents said they are considering residents’ quality of life along with the project’s funding sources and biggest beneficiaries.
Harvard has already committed hundreds of millions of dollars to the project — formally known as the Allston Multimodal Project — which will replace the aging viaduct along Soldiers Field Road, straighten the Massachusetts Turnpike that runs through Allston, and clear up 130 acres of Harvard-owned land for development.
It will also improve bicycle and pedestrian pathways, establish the West Station stop on the Framingham/Worcester commuter rail line, and create more green spaces along Charles River, per the state’s Department of Transportation website.
In January, state transportation officials indicated that they would scrap most of those plans and only move forward with repairs to the current viaduct, unless Boston contributed funding to the project and Harvard forked over additional funds. Several days later, the state’s transportation oversight board loosened that stance, voting to “examine” whether it would require additional third-party funding, rather than outright require it, according to the Boston Globe.
Harvard has not indicated whether it would agree to provide more money to the project.
Massachusetts State Rep. Michael J. Moran, a Brighton resident, said his views are “very much in line” with Harvard’s vision for the project regarding the highway straightening and the creation of West Station.
Moran noted that Harvard will be the “single biggest beneficiary” from the development — including the West Station planned in Allston.
“They should contribute more to that stop, simple because they’re the ones that are going to benefit the most from it,” Moran said. “They’re going to benefit from the taxpayers straightening the Pike. They’re going to benefit from the taxpayers paying for this stop.”
The University has already committed $58 million in direct support of the construction of West Station, in addition to its funding toward other aspects of the project.
Moran added that he believes the new Biden administration will help hasten the project.
“This new president in office, I think, is going to only help us as we try to have this project come to fruition,” Moran said. “Whether that be additional federal funds, whether that be legislation that helps move the process move along a little quicker.”
Chris Osgood, Boston Chief of the Streets, Transportation, and Sanitation, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the Allston Multimodal project is “transformative.” He added that Boston is in communication with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, residents, and community institutions concerning funding and design.
“Given the new Federal administration in Washington DC and its focus on infrastructure, and given all the benefits of this project, we would recommend focusing there first for 3rd party support,” Osgood said.
Moran said he is concerned that residents may have “to live through a lot of years of construction.” He added that he is focused on preserving the quality of life for residents during the span of the project, and is thinking about how to manage parking, construction work hours, and keeping truck routes out of the neighborhood.
“How is this going to affect the people that live on Wyndham, the people that live on Hopedale? How is it going to affect their quality of life? And my job, I always feel is to guard for that first and make sure that their voices are heard,” Moran said.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association and a local resident, said he supports the Turnpike project and all the improvements it entails for public life.
“A successful Allston I-90 project, with all the modes of transportation that we’re looking to implement and improve, would have a resounding impact, in many ways, on the local economy, on job creation, on housing—you name it,” he said.
He spoke in particular about the economic potential of establishing a connection between West Station and Kendall Square, where there are many job opportunities.
“It’s really a once-in-a-generational opportunity to really make an impactful statement regarding regional transportation in the area and really focus on a better path forward,” he added. “We need a more balanced transportation system, and this is the way to do it.”
Despite the transportation opportunities the project presents, D’Isidoro said he feels the Massachusetts Department of Transportation’s handling of the development has been “erratic.”
Part of his concern, he said, stems from the Department’s recent request for increased funding for the project from Harvard.
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation declined to comment.
Though D’Isidoro said he is skeptical Harvard would back out of the project due to the “substantial financial benefits” the University would gain from the increase in developable land, he said he fears disagreement over funding.
“If we can’t reach agreement and get funding, they may just reduce it back down to just a viaduct repair project and take another look at it 10 years from now,” D’Isidoro said. “It would be an enormous mistake. A massive mistake.”
D’Isidoro added that he worries such disputes would force the Department to exercise a “no-build option,” which would include only a renovation of the viaduct and none of the amenities D’Isidoro believes would benefit Allston.
Despite funding disagreements, D’Isidoro said he remains determined to ensure that the state delivers the project, with all its amenities.
“This project is personal to every resident of Allston; this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix a lot of mistakes that were made along the line,” he said.
“Allston has been on the short end of a lot of things,” he added. “We have to be constantly vigilant, and to speak up when we need to speak up to make things right.”
