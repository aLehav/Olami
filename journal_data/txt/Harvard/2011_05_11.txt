After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are many people working to improve the quality of life in Harvard’s residential dorms, from House Council members hosting fun-themed Stein Clubs to University administrators planning for a massive renovation of the River Houses. This is how it should be; a strong House system is vital to ensuring that the undergraduate experience is socially meaningful as well as academically fulfilling. Through spending time in their Houses, students get to know world-class professors who serve as House Masters, enterprising and talented graduate students who serve as tutors, and a good cross-section of their own peers. On the other hand, if, for whatever reason, the Houses are not appealing social options, students tend to become more heavily involved in organizations that are more homogenous and miss out on the best opportunities the College offers to learn about parts of Harvard and society that are totally foreign to them.
In this light, the newly created Cabot Café is a tremendously valuable project that students and administrators should support as much as possible
The Café, which was started by Laura S. Hinton ’13, Jesse J. Kaplan ’13, Chandan G. Lodha ’13, and Crimson photo editor Daniel M. Lynch ’13, is located in a common space down the hall from Cabot Dining Hall. It offers coffee (better than the dining hall), pastries, and sandwiches as well as ample seating for talking and studying. During its trial period from Tuesday to Friday last week, 100-160 customers came each day, with the café hosting around 30 people at any given time. The numbers themselves are a clear indication of success. Students like the café and want to see it continue. This is unsurprising, given that this concept mimics that of the most successful social space on our campus—Lamont Café.
However, beyond popular opinion, the Café is good idea to support. For one, it is a nice place to hang out in the Quad, which, frankly, deserves such a thing, being so far from the geographic center of undergraduate life. It offers a site for conversation and debate, making it different from the House Grilles, which are often a place to order curly fries in pajamas and go back to studying or to get quick mozz sticks when drunk—services that are very necessary but perhaps not as formative.
Additionally, the way in which the Cafe came to be is a model for future social space projects at Harvard. Hinton, Kaplan, Lodha, and Lynch worked with Cabot House tutor Stephen J. Vider and Cabot House Masters Rakesh and Stephanie Khurana on its conception, so the Cafe represents the work of key interest groups that need to get along for a House project to work. It started out small, so the organizers could make sure that students liked the idea. In the fall, the organizers say there will be paid barristas and possibly morning hours, in response to feedback from the trial period.
True, Cabot Café is not a grand, multi-level student center, the return of the Party Fund, or a memorable House formal, but perhaps it is something better. A House Café costs not more than a few thousand dollars to start up—all that is needed are coffee machines, furniture, and a good location. It is a cost-effective way to improve student social life in a substantive and healthy way. College administrators, House Council members, and all with an interest in vibrant House life should take note.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In less than a month, the latest crop of soon-to-be Harvard Law School graduates will join their fellow graduates from across the University in receiving their hard-earned diplomas. But unlike some of their peers, graduating students of Harvard Law School may be in for a shocking surprise: Their diplomas are unreadable, because they are in Latin.
Despite having learned a smattering of Latin phrases such as inter alia, sui generis, and res ipsa loquitur during their time at Harvard—a complementary bonus that comes with an education in the conservative field of law—few Harvard Law School students know enough Latin to actually read their diplomas. And for those in the general population who might have occasion to rest their gaze on one of these treasured trophies of achievement, the chances of comprehension are lower still.
The Harvard diploma is the symbolic embodiment of success and accomplishment achieved through years of effort at one of the world’s foremost institutions of higher learning. As such, most graduates will presumably wish to display theirs prominently for perusal by themselves, family, friends, clients, and others. What else, after all, is a diploma for?
Nevertheless, the Law School’s Latin diplomas continue to come up short on comprehensibility, to the point of even robbing graduates of the august, world-renowned Harvard brand name used in association with the University in virtually every other context. The name “Harvard” is printed in newspapers, magazines, and journals; it is mentioned in films, speeches, and casual conversation; it appears on official university clothing, vehicles, and memorabilia. It can be found prominently placed on admissions letters, transcripts, billing statements, and the University’s own web page. The name “Harvard” is even found on sample Harvard diplomas in the brochure for Harvard diploma frames found at the Harvard Coop located in—of all places—Harvard Square. Yet Harvard Law School does not offer its graduates diplomas that likewise utilize this legendary brand name that has been centuries in the making. Instead, the Law School completely eschews the working language of the institution and its host society in favor of the more traditional Latin, so much so that its diplomas do not even contain the phrases “Harvard University” or “Harvard Law School”—or even the word “Harvard”—anywhere on them.
History and tradition might well be called upon to justify such an obfuscation of meaning. Harvard is, after all, the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, founded at a time when Latin was decidedly in vogue for scholarly pursuits. Indeed, Latin was still an important pillar of a Harvard education nearly 100 years later, when, in 1734, entry to the all-male school was dependent upon a candidate having been able “extempore to read, construe, and parse Tully, Virgil, or such like common classical Latin authors, and to write true Latin in prose, and to be skilled in making Latin verse, or at least in the rules of Prosodia . . . .”
Some 275 years later, however, the social context has changed enormously. Latin no longer enjoys a strong association with contemporary educated individuals, nor is it even readable by the majority of them (to say nothing of the general population). Perhaps in recognition of this, many schools—including some other schools at Harvard and even some otherwise highly conservative Jesuit universities—choose to offer their diplomas in English, while the Law School diploma, seemingly oblivious to the dramatic societal changes surrounding it, remains stubbornly stuck in the past.
Harvard need not give up its rich Latin tradition in order to improve the communicative impact of its diplomas. Diplomas could, for example, be issued primarily in Latin but with the name of the University and the name of the degree written in English. Or graduates might be given a choice between English and Latin, since all diplomas must be customized anyway with the graduate’s name.
As crowds disperse and the lingering echoes of the commencement ceremony fade, Harvard graduates will be on their way to new lives and new challenges. Wherever alums choose to go, however, diplomas will accompany them throughout their lives. Given the diploma’s enduring value and significance as a vessel of meaning, we members of the Harvard community might do well to reconsider the form of this venerable token of erudition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a Canadian, going to school in the United States can present difficulties—besides my struggle to incorrectly say “pasta,” I often wrestle with the lack of awareness about Canadian politics. As I sat on my couch last week eagerly awaiting the results of the Canadian federal election, I watched as the political dynamic of my country changed substantially and historically. The right-leaning Conservative Party led by our prime minister, Stephen Harper, won a majority government, while for the first time in Canadian history the left-leaning New Democratic Party became the Official Opposition. This majority ensures that the next election may not be until 2015. The question begged by this election, however, is one of a fading Canadian distinctiveness as we have quite apparently become willing to compromise our values for the sake of our economy, and to bid adieu (see, we are bilingual) to our conventionally centrist political identity.
Perhaps the most relevant impact of this election for students of Harvard is the defeat of Michael Ignatieff, the former leader of the Liberal Party and the former leader of the Opposition. Ignatieff’s most trying test during his time as Liberal leader was to reconcile his American education at Harvard and elsewhere abroad with his identity as a true Canadian. Crafted as “elitist,” “insincere,” and “just visiting,” Ignatieff not only had to argue for broad political ideals regarding open democracy—which were oftentimes compromised by Harper’s politics, but he was also forced by his opponents and the media to prove himself as a legitimate candidate. Instead, Ignatieff ought to be thought of as the real icon of what a Canadian looks like; born to a Russian immigrant father and Canadian mother, he worked hard to achieve a world-class education and now stands as a prominent figure in both political thought and academia. Additionally, in his defense of human rights and the protection of democracy, Ignatieff represents the very ideals that Canada prides herself on in the first place.
The defeat of Ignatieff and his Liberal Party is, indeed, a sad moment in Canada’s narrative not only for what it signifies politically, but also because it shows a widespread fear of progress. The close-mindedness that grips Canadian politics is manifest in the Opposition that maneuvered itself against Ignatieff for fear that he had spent too much time abroad and learned too much from the world around him. For a country that is stereotyped here in the U.S. as a country that is accepting of everyone and everything, this federal election depicts a Canada that is moving in a steadily more exclusive and narrow direction.
For Canadian politics at large, it appears that the defeat of the Liberal Party might also represent the demise of Canadian liberalism. The new Official Opposition, the NDP, has no experience holding the government accountable as it has never before had this responsibility, and could instead act as a left-wing fringe party. Moreover, as difficult as it was for the NDP to get the Government to listen when the Government was in a minority position, it will be even more difficult for leftist politics to have its voice heard in a Conservative majority government. In all reality, the increased number of seats in Parliament for the NDP means nothing if they have come at the expense of the Liberal Party. Furthermore, the majority of the NDP caucus is from Quebec and has close to no political experience. The NDP will form the new Opposition for the first time and in doing so will paint an image of a polarized Canada as centrist policies fall in the dust of a liberal Canadian past. Farewell to Iggy, but also farewell to Canada as we know it.

Most proposed changes to the healthcare system involve a tradeoff between costs and health outcomes. A potential exception to this rule would be a policy that increases kidney donation, which would allow substantial savings on dialysis therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease. The policy would also improve these patients’ quality of life and reduce the kidney shortage that causes black market organ trafficking. While it would be controversial, a regulated market in which living persons could accept monetary compensation for kidney donations may be the best way to boost transplants.
About half a million Americans are being treated for kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease. The average wait for a kidney transplant, which is usually the optimal treatment, is about five years, and those without access to a donated kidney receive expensive dialysis therapy. Dialysis patients experience deteriorating health and living conditions, and many die waiting for a transplant. While donations have increased modestly in the past few years, demand has surged thanks to success with transplantation as well as an aging population and higher rates of chronic disease that cause kidney failure.
Although the risks of organ donation cannot be dismissed, the mortality risk for live kidney donors has been estimated at 0.03 percent. The reason supply does not rise to meet demand has less to do with the consequences of surgery than with the fact that U.S. law prohibits individuals from being paid for their organs, meaning transplants are provided entirely by altruistic donors.
The shortage created by this policy has led to another problem: illegal organ trafficking.  Legally prohibited from paying American donors, dialysis patients have been known to seek paid transplants from desperately poor people in developing countries. Americans travel abroad for transplants, particularly to South America, and there are even reports of third world donors being brought to the United States. Under-the-table transplants take place in medically precarious circumstances and are facilitated by organ traffickers, who often take advantage of donors’ poverty and ignorance. Murder for organ extraction and outright organ theft are rare, but it is not uncommon for traffickers to fail to pay willing donors their promised amount or to mislead them about the nature of the procedure. While there have been no comprehensive evaluations of the magnitude of organ trafficking, the heinous nature of the crime as well as its potential for growth in light of the ever-growing demand for kidneys, demands that it be addressed.
What can be done about the kidney shortage? The limited supply of viable organs from deceased donors and comparatively low rates of successful cadaveric transplants suggest that boosting deceased organ donation is only a partial solution. Attempts to increase altruistic donations by living donors have had limited success. On the other hand, economists Gary S. Becker of the University of Chicago and Julio J. Elias of Stanford estimated in 2007 that a payment of about $15, 200 per living kidney donation would generate enough willing donors to eliminate the shortage. Monetary compensation has worked in Iran, which created a government-run donor payment system in 1988, and for the past twelve years has been the only country in the world without a kidney waiting list.
Compared to the average medical cost of transplantation, which Becker and Elias put at $160,000, donor compensation would amount to a small price increase. The move could even be a cost saver. Dr. Arthur J. Matas of the University of Minnesota estimates payments on the order of $100,000 could be made to donors and still be cost-neutral given the savings on dialysis therapy. Since treatment for end-stage renal disease is covered by Medicare, an increase in kidney transplants would go a long way toward mitigating the program’s unsustainable budget trajectory.
The obvious caveat is that the market would need to be closely regulated to prevent the kind of exploitation that occurs in developing countries. The government would need to ensure that donors are fully informed of the consequences of surgery and receive adequate compensation and post-operative care. Even with such protections, an organ market might still be subject to criticism of exploitation of poor and lower middle-class donors, as well as its “commodification” of the human body and possible social repercussions for paid donors. These are legitimate objections, but it is doubtful that they outweigh the relief for dialysis patients, reduced incentives for organ trafficking, and substantial cuts to healthcare costs that would accrue from monetary compensation.
To establish a functional kidney market, Congress needs to repeal the ban on compensation and establish a regulatory framework. In the meantime, states can at least reimburse donors for the expenses of surgery. In January 2004, Wisconsin created a state income tax deduction for costs incurred by living donors in terms of travel, lodging, and lost wages, and seven other states have since enacted similar legislation. Altering incentives at the state level may be the best way to build support for a broader system of monetary compensation for organ donors. With proper oversight, such a system could eliminate a tremendous amount of suffering and waste.

Whether they’re working in the dark basement of Dudley House at Cafe Gato Rojo or in the bustling, commercial hangout at one of the two Starbucks in the Square, some students seek alternative study spaces during exam period.
Those who choose cafe settings over libraries say they find the library atmosphere to be stressful during the final weeks of the semester.
Elizabeth H. Thompson ’12 says she enjoys seeing her peers studying around her, but prefers finding company in a space that is more relaxed than a library.
“I like being around people when I study,” she says, sitting inside at Gato Rojo. “Particularly people who aren’t crazy.”
Sipping on a cup of hot tea at the Starbucks in The Garage, Shira B. Kogan ’14 says that she normally doesn’t mind studying in libraries. But she avoids Lamont during finals week to escape the intense environment.
“There’s more of a stress vibe in libraries,” she says. “I like getting tea and working in a cafe.”
Another noted bonus of studying in a coffee shop or dining hall is that food and drinks are readily available.
Shawn G. De Martino ’14 says that his lack of sleep brought him to Starbucks, where he depends on Americanos—a beverage made with hot water and espresso—to keep him awake.
Emma Q. Wang ’12 says she prefers eating foods with carbohydrates because they provide her with fuel for studying.
“Carb loading isn’t just for marathons,” she says, looking up from study notes for her upcoming exam in Ethical Reasoning 11: “Human Rights: A Philosophical Introduction.”
While DeMartino says he thought more students studied in cafes during exam period, employees at local establishments say they have not seen a significant increase in student traffic.
One Starbucks store manager says that the beginning of tourist season coincides with exam period, making it difficult to tell if a sales increase is due to purchases made by students or visitors to Cambridge.
Catherine Zhu ’11, who works at Cafe Gato Rojo, says she has seen fewer students at the Harvard Yard coffee shop.
“[Gato Rojo] is a nice change of pace, but you can’t do real work here,” she says.
While the environment might be more relaxed outside of the library, Zhu also says she thinks the small amount of space and lack of power outlets in the basement cafe prevented students from staying for extended periods of time.
According to the Starbucks manager, the same students who study in the shop regularly during the semester are the ones who come during exam period.
“There’s a kid who comes in here and stays for like five hours a day,” she says.
Still, some students say the intensity of finals period calls for the lively atmosphere of a cafe.
“If I have a large chunk of time, I can spend a whole day in a cafe,” Kogan says. “It’s good if you get in the groove of it.”

Winthrop House cemented its dynasty on Monday, claiming the Straus Cup for its fourth consecutive year and the 14th time since 1935.
At the same ceremony in the Murr Center, freshman dorms Apley Court and Massachusetts Hall took the Yard Bucket, ending a drought that spanned the history of the freshman intramural program.
Residents in Winthrop House attributed their repeated successes to high participation on the part of Winthrop students.
“We just don’t give up when it comes to trying to get people out there,” Maria C. M. Persson Gulda, a resident tutor and IM sports coordinator, said. “There’s an event for everyone, and that’s really the motto in our House.”
And once people make it to the field or the court, the game plan, according to one Winthropian, is easy.
“In Winthrop House, our strategy is very simple: All we do is win,” said Chris W. Higgins ’11.
Though Winthrop’s record set high expectations for the House, its four-peat was not assured from the start. In the fall, Winthrop tied with Leverett, losing out at flag football but scoring a significant win at tennis.
But in the winter, Winthrop secured a substantial lead, thanks to victories in all three basketball leagues. And this spring, Winthrop dominated on many fronts, with repeated wins on the tennis court, the swimming pool, and at the River Run.
Following the ceremony on Monday in the Murr Center, Winthropians stormed the streets, Straus Cup in hand, parading through the other Harvard Houses in victory. Chanting phrases like “Four more years” and “We are Winthrop,” the procession marched through Eliot, Kirkland, and Leverett courtyards, ending in the Winthrop Dining Hall, where they deposited the cup in a trophy case.
The Straus Cup has not changed hands since 2007, when Lowell took the award, but Winthrop’s record is not the longest in recent memory. From 1995 until 2001, the Straus Cup found itself Quadded, with Cabot House boasting a seven-year streak.
For the freshman team of Apley Court and Mass. Hall, which combines in competition due to how small each is individually, victory was, for years, just barely out of reach.
The Class of 2011 and 2012 both came in second for the Yard Bucket, spurring this year’s residents to claim what was almost theirs.
“We used these close finishes as kind of our rallying cry for this year,” said Nathan T. Fry, a proctor in Apley. According to David C. Liu ’14, the IM representative and captain for Apley Court, 27 out of the 28 students in Apley participated in some sport throughout the season.
The Mass. Hall-Apley Court duo edged out Grays in second and Matthews in third. At the ceremony the intramural program also recognized Robert M. Cross ’11, Kelly N. Bodwin ’11, and Alyssa J. Mackey ’11 as Paul F. Gilligan III athletes of the year.

Friends and family of Clare M. Gillis, a Harvard graduate and freelance reporter who has been held by the Libyan government for over a month, will gather for a candlelight vigil tonight to demand her immediate release.
The vigil is scheduled to take place from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on the steps of Memorial Church.
On a Facebook page created for the event, 50 people have confirmed attendance as of last night, including the parents of James Foley, another freelance journalist who was detained with Gillis.
Gillis’ parents will be delivering an address at the beginning of the vigil.
Organizers also invited University President Drew G. Faust, faculty members, the media, and senators and congressman who have been advocating for Gillis, according to Jesse C. Howell, a coordinator for the vigil and friend of Gillis’.
Howell said the idea for the vigil was prompted in part by the recent closure of the Turkish Embassy in Libya, which was previously negotiating Gillis and Foley’s release.
Howell also said that personal interactions with Foley’s parents at an event last week made the journalists’ captivity more “real” and “present” and motivated Gillis’ friends to hold the vigil.
“We want to keep Clare on the mind of the media and the public,” Howell said.
“The better we could introduce Clare’s story to people who don’t know her as well as us, the better we could spread the message about her situation in Libya,” Howell said.
“We don’t want [Foley and Gillis’ case] to go by and be forgotten,” said Ece G. Turnator, another organizer of the vigil and a good friend of Gillis’, who expressed concern with the diplomatic situation in Libya.
“Our primary hope is that the U.S. State Department would be successful in securing Clare’s release, but I think ... there is an international interest in Clare as an individual and ... in the freedom of journalists to pursue their work around the world,” Howell said.
“In terms of speculating about the future, we hope that other countries would be able to spread the word about Clare and other people involved as well,” Howell added.
Max Fisher, an associate editor for the international channel of The Atlantic magazine, echoed Howell and Turnator’s call to raise awareness of the situation and to continue to publicly appeal the Libyan government for Gillis and Foley’s release.
He said that The Atlantic has been in communication with NGOs and the State Department and has been coordinating information sharing to make sure that “everyone knows what has been happening and everyone is on the same page.”

He could have taken one of the hundreds of jobs offered by the Harvard University Library system like many of his peers. He could have turned to Dorm Crew, or he could have chosen to work as an office assistant in one of the College’s many departments when he needed a little extra spending money. But last year, Todd G. Venook ’13 found it much simpler to skip getting a “real” part-time job and to instead venture across the river to the Business School when he needed some extra cash.
“Last year, whenever I wanted to go to a concert or something like that, I would just go to a business school study and that would pay for it,” Venook said. “It’s a nice way to pick up an occasional 20 bucks here and there.”
Although Venook now earns money as a Peer Advising Fellow and no longer needs to trek to the Business School each time he needs a fresh $20 bill, many undergraduates continue to earn money by frequenting studies conducted by the graduate schools, which offer human subjects an average of $10 to $20 per study.
As undergraduates flock to participate in these studies, the availability of easy money in labs is posing a challenge to the idea of the traditional undergraduate job that has students camped out behind a desk in a dusty library with one’s books while bringing home minimum wage. And because Harvard boasts some of the highest payments for human subjects of any school in the country undergraduates are readily taking advantage of the researchers’ deep pockets.
Sites like the Business School Computer Lab for Experimental Research and the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory are especially popular among undergraduates, because studies require minimal registration, rarely take longer than an hour, and can earn students up to $25 in a single sitting.
As a result a growing group of undergraduates frequently opt to rely on study participation as a supplement to, or in some cases, a replacement for, a part-time job.
“It’s a lot easier than going in and working somewhere,” Zak T. Aossey ’14 said. “You make about the same amount in an hour than you would in two at a regular on-campus job. Whenever I have a week off, I’ll try to go in and do as many as I can.”
Aossey earns a steady income working part-time for the Institute of Politics and the athletic department, which is just across the street from the Business school where he can make what he calls “easy money.”
Aossey says that on a good week he can squeeze up to three CLER studies in a single week. He recently earned $120 for his efforts as a human subject—clicking buttons on a computer screen and answering questionnaires—over a two-week period.
CLER studies offer the highest compensation because unlike most of the graduate school studies CLER does not limit participants to a maximum number of studies in a single year. The Psychology department and Decision Science Laboratory have a cap in place of 10 and 15 studies, respectively.
However, for tax reasons, all graduate schools are required by the University to limit the earnings of a subject to $600 in one fiscal year.
Because it has no limit to the number of studies allowed and also averages the highest compensation per study of the three departments, CLER has approximately two or three subjects per year that reach the limit.
The ample opportunity to make money through these studies is tempting enough to for students like Philip Choi ’14 to refrain from entering the labor force.
“I go whenever there are studies open on the CLER website or the decision lab,” said Choi. “Usually, my parents give me cash, but other than that, this is kind of my only thing.”
Choi claims the flexibility of the study schedule is much more appealing to students than the structured schedule of most jobs.
But a small, dedicated group of study participants can also raise problems for researchers who seek a representative sample in their data. If the same group of individuals are participating in studies on a regular basis, that can raise questions about data integrity.
According to Psychology Department Study Pool Coordinator Janet Smith, researchers highly encourage undergraduate participation in pools because it broadens and diversifies data. However, the department discourages and tries to prevent one participant from taking too many studies because it can damage data validity.
That is a big part of why many schools cap the number of studies one subject can participate in during a year.
“The more people we have participating the better the data will be,” Smith said. “That is true with any kind of research. If you do a study with 500 people rather than five, you’re going to get better data because you have better sampling.”
Sometimes individuals try to get around the 15 study limit or do not pay close attention to the study requirements, she said.
“It’s better for all of us if people follow the rules,” Smith said. “It would really help us if people take a look at the rules. The rules we have help protect the data.”
But for students, the flexibility of the job can also come with inconsistency.
Studies are offered during most hours of the work day and students may sign up for them up to 24 hours in advance, allowing the system to accommodate virtually any schedule. But since studies are not scheduled everyday and have limited enrollment, it can be challenging to always find a suitable time slot, which can make it difficult to rely on study participation as a steady source of income.
“Sometimes, there are no studies one week and a ton the next week,” said Sarah Hirschfeld-Sussman, Laboratory Manager at the Decision Science Laboratory. “With a library job, there is a lot of consistency, but with us, it’s a little more risky.”
Despite these risks, Hirschfeld-Sussman says that the nature of the studies serves as an incentive for undergraduates to participate.
“It’s fun and it’s different,” Hirschfeld-Sussman said. “Every time you come it’s a completely different study. Sometimes, you get results about yourself, your behavior, and how you make decisions.”
Students echo Hirschfeld-Sussman’s assertions and say that participating in studies can be a more enjoyable experience than working a desk job.
“I think some of them are pretty interesting to do and a more fun way to make money,” said Angela C. Li ’14, who frequents studies at the Psychology Department. “They have you do pretty interesting things, but also I’ve read a lot about psych studies, and it’s really nice to be on the other side of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Children’s rights activist Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children’s Defense Fund, spoke yesterday at the Graduate School of Education about the difficulties in her personal attempts to improve conditions for children in America.
Edelman, who has received both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the MacArthur “Genius Award” Fellowship, said that black children are facing their “worst crisis since slavery,” pointing to a low quality of education and high rates of youth incarceration.
Kathleen McCartney, Dean of the Ed School, introduced Edelman and called her an advocate for children.
“She challenged the country to stand for children, and her mantra was ‘leave no child behind.’ She was the first to say this,” said McCartney, a specialist in early childhood development.
Edelman said she views her cause as the “grandchild of civil rights,” but that the movement for children’s rights has been more difficult in voicing.
“I thought if we just told people the facts and realities of children’s lives, that they would respond,” Edelman said. Instead, the Children’s Defense Fund is nearing its fourth decade, and Edelman described the current landscape for black and Latino children as a “crisis.”
In particular, Edelman spoke of the Fund’s Cradle to Prison Pipeline campaign, which aims to change the current trend of young, delinquent, minority children ending up in jails.
“I believe incarceration is becoming the new American apartheid,” she said. “How can six and seven and eight-year-old children be arrested and handcuffed on school grounds for offenses that used to be handled in the principal’s office, and there’s not a huge ruckus from the community of adults?”
Edelman said that black males are six times as likely to be incarcerated as white males, and said that trend has to be reversed for children.
“We adults have lost our common sense,” she said. “We seem, as a nation, to have become addicted to incarceration as a first resort.”
Andrea N. Black, an Ed School student who attended a childhood program that was similar to the fund’s Freedom Schools, said that Edelman’s work restored her passion to work in troubled communities. She said her summer program allowed her to meet and get to know the leaders in her neighborhood, and that the approach Edelman takes in involving the community is the proper mentality.
“It’s not uplifting out of neighborhoods, but giving [children] opportunities to transcend poverty to do what I’m doing,” Black said. “It’s not about leaving a neighborhood, it’s about building.”
Lashunda S. Hill, an Ed School student who has worked with the Fund in the past, said that reform will require cooperation from multiple levels of society and not only schools.
“It’s going to take all child service agencies to correct those problems,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s acceptance rate for legacies has hovered around 30 percent—more than four times the regular admission rate—in recent admissions cycles, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson in an interview this week.
Fitzsimmons also said that Harvard’s undergraduate population is comprised of approximately 12 to 13 percent legacies, a group he defined as children of Harvard College alumni and Radcliffe College alumnae.
Fitzsimmons’ comments came the week after a discussion at New York University on legacy admissions between Yale Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jeffrey Brenzel, senior fellow at The Century Foundation Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85, and Bloomberg News editor at large Daniel L. Golden ’78.
According to a New York Times story on the event, Brenzel said that Yale rejected 80 percent of its legacy applicants. Brenzel reported that Yale legacies comprise less than 10 percent of the class, according to Kahlenberg.
Brenzel also said that there is a positive correlation between alumni donations and legacy admissions. According to Brenzel, Yale fundraising suffers when fewer legacies are accepted. Still, he said, this year Yale rejected more children of top donors than it accepted.
Asked if the Admissions Office communicates with University development at Harvard, Fitzsimmons emphasized the copious amount of information he receives about each applicant. “There is no formal mechanism of communication,” he said.
Kahlenberg, who edited a book entitled “Affirmative Action for the Rich: Legacy Preferences in College Admissions,” has worked to draw attention to the issue of legacy admissions at highly selective colleges.
“There’s been so much focus on affirmative action in college admissions ... Here there is a very large affirmative action program for wealthy students that gets very little attention,” Kahlenberg said. “It’s really a relic of European-style aristocracy that has no place in American higher education.”
Fitzsimmons defended Harvard’s legacy admissions rate.
“If you look at the credentials of Harvard alumni and alumnae sons and daughters, they are better candidates on average,” said Fitzsimmons, part of what he sees as the explanation for the disparity in the acceptance rate. “Very few who apply have no chance of getting in.”
Because of the family background of legacies, he said, students are more likely to be aware if they are unlikely to be accepted.
“It does no one any good to have a student come here and have an unhappy experience,” Fitzsimmons said.
Fitzsimmons said that legacy status, in addition to factors such as place of residence, acts as one of many “tips” in the admissions process at Harvard. All other things being substantially equal, he said, legacy status can “tip” an applicant into the group of accepted students.
But Fitzsimmons emphasized that a number factors, beyond the “tip,” lead to this higher acceptance rate. He said the pool of legacy applicants is a  self-selecting group.
“Some parents are particularly reluctant to push their own institution,” Fitzsimmons said. “They want to make sure that their son or daughter really wants to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I of this series appeared May 6, Part II appeared May 9.)
Mt. Auburn Street is a testament to the proliferation of off-campus social spaces at Harvard—scattered among University-owned buildings are five separate final clubs and The Lampoon, with four other final clubs and The Crimson in close proximity.
The shortage of on-campus social spaces—due, in part, to the absence of a central student center and restrictions on the use of campus space—has been a perennial student complaint and a frequent topic of discussion among student leaders in recent years.
As a result, many students are turning to off-campus spaces—with their copious square footage and distance from the rules of the College—as new hubs of social life, filling the role of a student center during the day and a party space at night.
“[Students] see Harvard not resolving it, so they think, 'Let me seek some other group that’s going to resolve it,'” says the president of a male final club, who requested anonymity in order to protect his relationship with the club’s alumni. “I think a lot of students solve problems by pursuing off campus establishments.”
THE SPACES
Final clubs are some of the most visible off-campus spaces frequented by undergraduates, but other options have recently flourished.
Over the past few years, the chapters of Harvard’s burgeoning Greek scene have increasingly secured independent space in Cambridge.
The Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi fraternities occupy property on Harvard Street and Mass. Ave., respectively, and the Delta Gamma sorority recently acquired a venue on Other Greek organizations are currently looking for their own spaces, according to members of the organizations.
In addition, several officially recognized student publications—including The Crimson, the Harvard Advocate, and The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine—have their own buildings in the Square.
A SPACE OF THEIR OWN
For many of these groups, having an independently owned and operated space is one of the defining features of their experiences.
Free from the constraints of having to reserve highly sought after meeting spaces in Houses and the prohibitive costs of renting some of the larger on-campus social venues, recognized student groups have found that having a space all to themselves has eased the functioning of their organization.
Joseph B. Morcos ’12, a member of The Advocate, says that although the primary purpose of the organization’s building is to play host to the production of a magazine, it serves a social function as well.
“Everyone in the organization has the keys to the building, so people can go there to drink on a Friday night or to do homework during the day,” Morcos says.
And for unrecognized groups—who enjoy none of the benefits of being an officially recognized organization, such as the privilege of using College spaces for group functions—having an independent venue can be crucial to their success.
Delta Gamma recently moved into their new space, giving the chapter a place to hold weekly meetings and their members a place in the Square to gather more informally.
“A lot of the girls who live in the Quad are saying that it’ll be a really good place for them to hang out, do homework, watch TV,” says Caroline T. Quazzo ’12, the president of Delta Gamma.
THE RECOGNITION QUESTION
Official recognition for final clubs, fraternities, and sororities—revoked by the College in 1984 due to the gender-discriminatory recruitment policies of the clubs—is a topic that has been repeatedly discussed, most recently in the election campaign platform of current Undergraduate Council leaders Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12.
Suzy M. Nelson, dean of student life, says that the gender discrimination issue—as well as sorority and fraternity ties to national organizations—make it unlikely that Greek life will be recognized in the near future.
However, some groups say that the acquisition of an independent space actually negates the need to pursue a relationship with the College.
Once reserving common room spaces or having dorm parties is no longer an issue, club leaders say the recognition may just lead to more unwanted scrutiny from the College administration.
Assistant Dean of Student Life Susan B. Marine said in an interview in February that fraternities have been less involved than sororities in the attempt to establish an official Greek presence on campus, adding that the fraternities—most of which already have established spaces in the Square—may have less reason to seek official relationships with the College.
“Being officially recognized by the university just makes more of a hassle for groups,” says the same president of one male final club.
A PLACE TO PARTY
Given the oft-mentioned dearth of on-campus social options for undergraduates, the most obvious presence of these off-campus options may be their function in Harvard’s party scene.
While students at other colleges rely on off-campus apartments and a thriving bar scene to get their party fix, the Harvard social scene is very different. For many Harvard students looking for a large-scale party free from the oversight of the administration, final clubs and Greek organizations present the only viable option.
“At final clubs you know that there’s always something going on,” says Alexandra P. Berman ’13. “If you’re looking for something to do, and you can’t find any other party, you know there’s always something happening there.”
However, student leaders say that strong interest in off-campus venues should not be viewed as a solution to the lack of a robust campus-centric social scene, and that the administration should continue to work towards fixing the campus social space issue.
“Harvard owns a ridiculous amount of land and real estate,” says the same male final club president. “When you look at the amount owned by Harvard and the clubs, it’s not even a comparison.”
Tara D. Venkatraman ’11, a leader in the Harvard Students for Safe Space Campaign—a College-recognized group that advocates, among other things, increased transparency and inclusiveness on the part of final clubs—agreed, adding that the College should create more on-campus alternatives.
“There’s a common crisis of social space at Harvard,” Venkatraman says. “The administration can do a lot more to confront that.”
NOT JUST A PARTY THING
Members of groups with off-campus space say that although having a space to party on weekends is a draw, it is not the only social benefit of off-campus areas: their spaces also give them a place to hang out and socialize with friends.
“The social aspect of a club is a very small part of it,” says the same male final club president. “It gives you a type of affiliation.”
But whether it is for parties or informal gatherings, students agree that the real estate plays a large role in making these interactions possible.
“If you ask social club members, what’s the best thing about being in a social club, they’ll say the people,” Ebrahim says. “But where do you go to meet the people? It’s the place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I of this series appeared May 9. Part III appeared May 13.)
With her flannel shirt and short hair gelled into a stiff side part, it’s hard to identify Anna N. Murphy ’12 as male or female.
Her style is more Goodwill than Urban Outfitters, set off with big belt-buckles and cowboy boots. Some might call her hipster—or hispter-esque at least—but these are political clothes that blur the line between masculine and feminine.
Murphy, a social studies concentrator, identifies as transgender, which means her appearance is more masculine than feminine.
When she arrived at Harvard, Murphy’s dark black hair was long and reached her shoulders, but over the course of the past three years, she has cut it shorter and shorter, resulting in a fair bit of confusion—“I’m called ‘sir’ in lecture often,” Murphy says.
Today, it’s become less taboo for individuals like Murphy to blur gender lines. But for Murphy, whose gender-bending appearance breaks from the norm, life comes with a series of choices that box her into the category of male or female, and nowhere is that more true than in that most everyday of actions—going to the restroom.
With simplistic stick figures adorning its doors—a woman in a dress and the outline of a man—the public bathroom is one of the last remaining institutions that sifts men from women.
And for those who cannot be easily identified by others as a man or woman, entering a single-gender bathroom can come with painful consequences. For that reason, activists have made the increased availability of gender neutral bathrooms one of their top priorities, actively lobbying for restrooms that allow both men and women to enter.
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
Cameron Partridge pulled over on the highway to use a rest stop bathroom. He crossed the lobby and headed toward a restroom. At the time, Partridge identified as transgender but had yet to transition and therefore did not feel comfortable using the men’s restroom. So as he opened the door to the women’s restroom a man yelled, “Hey buddy—wait!” The man walked over with a dim-witted grin on his face and said to Partridge, “You’re about to go into the ladies room!”
Partridge looked at the man dumbfounded, turning words over in his head wondering what to say, and blurted out, “I know.” The man looked at Partridge strangely for a moment, apologized, and walked away.
Several years ago, while studying at the Divinity School, Partridge medically transitioned from female to male, but before that procedure he had a few uncomfortable experiences using women’s restrooms like the one at the rest stop. Now Partridge is a lecturer the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Department and at the Divinity School and says that while he doesn’t feel “traumatized” by these bathroom encounters, he appreciates—and has taken advantage of—the considerable number of single stall bathrooms that are available on the Divinity School’s campus.
It is practical considerations like these that lie at the heart of the movement for gender neutral bathrooms. The effort seeks to minimize the uncomfortable encounters, confrontations, and tensions that can arise when other individuals misread a trans person’s identity.
“So many people I know, including many women who are not trans-identified but whose gender presentation to some degree transgresses the gender norms of their context, have had the experience of being asked if they are in the ‘right bathroom’ or told they are in the ‘wrong’ one,” Partridge writes in an e-mail.
So as she walks around campus during her daily routine, Murphy has to be constantly aware of where the nearest single stall or gender neutral bathroom is located. And until gender neutral bathrooms become widely available, trans identified individuals will continue to have to structure their days around finding a comfortable place to do their everyday business.
Murphy’s soft voice—so soft that it is nearly drowned out by the hustle and bustle of Algiers Cafe—takes a serious note when she discusses her identity and its consequences. As she talks about gender neutral bathrooms, her eyes gaze down at her lap and she becomes introspective—it’s clear that this is an issue she has carefully considered many times before.
“Before I cut my hair short I remember seeing the gender neutral bathrooms in Canaday basement and thinking, ‘I wonder who those are for?’” Murphy says. “Now I guess I know that those bathrooms are for me.”
According to a 2006 report compiled by Queer Students and Allies (then called the Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian Transgender and Supporters Alliance), Harvard offers 73 gender neutral bathrooms—all of which are single-stalled—on campus.
But Trans Task Force student leader Jia Hui Lee ’12 says that these bathrooms are inconveniently located, with several main academic buildings lacking a gender neutral bathroom—including the Science Center and Sever Hall.
“So many people take it for granted that they can use a public bathroom,” Lee says. “For those who are trans and gender non-conforming, it’s much more difficult to use a bathroom in public.”
Critics of expanding access to gender neutral bathrooms say that they increase the likelihood of sexual assaults in such spaces, but the concept of individuals of different sexes sharing the same restroom is not all that radical, according to Marco Chan ’11, Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair.
“Everyone lives their gender in different ways, so this is everyone’s business,” he says with an uncharacteristic note of anger. Chan is arguably the most prominent face of the queer rights movement on campus, and this media-savvy spokesperson rarely gets angry in interviews. This is an issue, however, of paramount importance to his organization. “We all know people who bring their small children of a different sex into the bathroom, people who have caretakers of a different sex assist them in the bathroom. Gender neutral bathrooms will simplify the way we all live our lives. This is not just transgender or queer people’s business.”
LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE
With House Renewal set to kick off in mid-2012 with the renovation of Old Quincy, the Trans Task Force has made efforts to push the administration to take into account during the renovation the trans community’s needs for gender neutral bathrooms.
Lee, who says House common spaces already offer a good number of gender neutral bathrooms, hopes that the College will further increase its offerings despite arguments that point out Harvard’s trans population is relatively small.
“This is a matter of principle, not a matter of numbers,” Lee says.
The administration has been “receptive” to the Trans Task Force’s appeals, according to Lee. He is optimistic that after House Renewal renovations gender neutral bathrooms will be even more accessible.
The inclusion of gender neutral bathrooms in House Renewal “is part of our planning process and we do not anticipate any substantial problem,” writes Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson in an email.
When asked about the possibility of adding gender neutral bathrooms to academic buildings, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said that FAS is constrained by Cambridge and Massachusetts zoning laws as academic buildings are public spaces. There is “a lot more leeway” when creating gender neutral bathrooms in residential facilities like the Houses, according to Hammonds.
“Because of the limitations imposed by the state plumbing codes, there are real limitations in academic buildings,” Hammonds said.
But gender neutral bathrooms are “something they are aware of,” according to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal.
Chan, encouraged by the College’s receptiveness, says that everyone on Harvard’s campus should be able to access public restrooms comfortably and without incident.
“We should all be able to make a decision as simple as walking into a bathroom,” Chan says. “Why is this something we need to regulate?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale University dining hall workers and students will join their Harvard counterparts at a meeting for the local chapter of Unite Here to share negotiation strategies they have employed to reach an agreement on their current contract with Yale.
The meeting and discussion will follow a negotiation session between Unite Here Local 26 and the University in which both sides will put forth their official proposals for the coming contract negotiations. After the discussion with those at Yale, Unite Here members plan to rally in the Square.
Unite Here—a labor union whose members work in the hotel and food service industries, among others—represents Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services workers.
Unite Here Local 26 President Brian Lang said that Unite Here and the Yale workers decided it would be helpful for the workers to come down for the meeting, as those at Yale would be able to provide Unite Here with new ideas for compromises between the two bodies and help broaden their approach to the negotiations.
“Yale workers have some really interesting things in their contracts, some things that we would really like to see in our own,” Lang said.
Yale has had its own negotiation troubles with Unite Here in the past. In 2003, many union members went on strike as Unite Here and Yale were negotiating a new contract for one New Haven chapter of Unite Here.
SLAM member William P. Whitham ’14 said that he thinks Harvard has a lot to learn from the Yale contract, especially on the issue of sustainable food.
“When we went down to Yale, everyone was gushing about the food,” he said. “It’s really light-years ahead [of Harvard.]”
Lang said Unite Here is pushing for “sustainable jobs” for its workers, which he defined as jobs in which workers have job security, full-time employment, and the ability to pursue happy and productive lives.
Lang also said that bringing the Yale workers to the Unite Here meeting is important because it shows solidarity between workers across university boundaries—even between traditional rivals like Harvard and Yale.
“As workers, we have to stand in solidarity with one another,” Lang said. “They support us, and we support them.”
This is the second Unite Here Local 26 member meeting of the year which students have been invited to attend. SLAM members are promoting students’ attendance at the event as part of its “Sustainable Jobs” campaign.
“It’s important that people come out to support the workers,” said Whitham. “They really care about the students. It’s really the least [the students] can do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations (NELC) will offer a secondary field in Middle East studies this fall, creating the first undergraduate program focusing exclusively on the study of the modern Middle East.
“My hope is that this will eventually lead to the creation of a separate Middle East studies major, which is long overdue,” Department Chair Ali S. Asani said.
Although undergraduate interest in the Middle East has been growing over the last two decades, the College lacked a program designed specifically for students to study the modern Middle East. NELC has traditionally emphasized languages and the study of medieval and ancient civilizations.
“We have been discussing [creating a Middle East studies secondary] for years. Part of the problem is that we never really had enough courses across the disciplines to sustain a secondary concentration,” said William E. Granara, NELC professor and director of modern language programs.
“But now there have been some good hires and there has been a concerted effort on the part of the new chair of NELC and the directors and associate directors of [the Center for Middle Eastern Studies].”
The secondary field will consist of five courses: one required “gateway” course and four courses of the student’s choosing, according to Asani.
NELC lecturer Susan M. Kahn will coordinate the required course, NEC 100: “Approaches to Middle Eastern Studies,” which will be an interdisciplinary introduction to studying the region.
This new course “will give definition and focus to the field of the Middle East in a way we haven’t had before,” NELC Director of Undergraduate Studies Peter Machinist said.
Social Studies concentrator Chloe K. Goodwin ’12 said she was “extremely frustrated” there was no Middle East studies concentration. Although she considered creating her own concentration, she settled on studying the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within Social Studies.
“I am fine with the trajectory that my academic career has taken without Middle East studies being offered, but ... I think it’s ridiculous that there was no track for it,” Goodwin said.
For the four elective courses, students will be able to take Middle East focused classes in various departments, such as Anthropology, History of Art and Architecture, History, and Government, with approval from the director of undergraduate studies.
The department wanted to “create a program with sufficient flexibility with an intellectual coherence,” Asani said.
“I think this program is part of an initiative to try to think about the Middle East not just in terms of [NELC], but [also] drawing on the resources in various other departments,” he added.
Both Asani and Granara noted the hire of Malika Zeghal, a NELC professor and specialist on Middle East politics and religion, as an important move towards improving Middle East studies at Harvard.
But Granara noted the importance of support from other departments.
“NELC and CMES can’t do it all. We need commitment in departments like history, government, anthropology, fine arts, and sociology,” he said.
