After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Guerilla Toss, the formerly Boston- now Brooklyn-based experimental rockers, will be releasing their second album, “Eraser Stargazer,” on DFA Records on Mar. 4. Guerilla Toss—who are known for their intricate and complex yet simultaneously funky, skronky and powerfully rhythmic compositions—are producing some of the strangest, most interesting, and most innovative sounds in the Northeast. In advance of their upcoming album release, The Crimson had the chance to talk with lead singer and lyricist Kassie Carlson about the creation of their mind-bending music: from their dense yet danceable sonic arrays to their psychedelic, imagistic, almost mythic lyrics.
The Harvard Crimson: Do you have favorite tracks on the new album?
Kassie Carlson: My two favorite tracks are definitely “Grass Shack” and “Doll Face on the Calico Highway.”....I’m most excited about these because there are these two monologues in them that are super descriptive. There are a lot of references on this album to morphing tangible and intangible things—like textures and smells and tastes turning into actual tangible things like people, like the thick merino wool, like the homeless woman on a bus, things like that. So I really enjoyed writing that type of thing and presenting that. Because at the time I was reading a lot of really beautiful, descriptive books, and I was trying to incorporate that sort of thing into the song.
THC: What inspires you as a lyricist?
KC: Looking at things under a microscope [and seeing] the complexity and beauty of and everything. I was reading a lot of Herman Hesse at the time, he’s probably one of my favorite writers, some Milan Kundera, and a lot of stuff on the brain—how that affects perception, and things like that.
THC: How does “Eraser Stargazer” compare to Guerilla Toss’s previous work?
KC: The band has definitely changed over time. When I first met everybody, like four years ago—I can’t believe it—it was more of a contemporary improvisation jazz-realm type band. When we met, I was in a punk band.  So we all started playing together with a more harsh, aggressive, punk-oriented sound. Lately, I know it’s more dance-y and funky and stuff like that. But there are always the same kind of cerebral aspects of the music—like odd time signatures and weird sequencing of parts and complex lyrical stories.  I still love it just the same. It’s a direct interpretation of us and how we feel. We’re not trying to be anything….Pretty much everything is through composed. There’s not really much freeform. We’ve been trying to add a chant element to the live shows…. It commits us to making every show a unique experience.
THC: What is your composition process like?
KC: Right now we’re kind of doing the same thing we did with “Eraser Stargazer” where we took a bunch of time off and we’re up in upstate New York….When we wrote “Eraser Stargazer” we would kind of only play music all day, sometimes eight hours a day, trying everything like a hundred which ways. Usually Peter, the drummer, will come in with an idea, like a small part, and we’ll all develop parts for it and kind of jam on it for a while and try to find like riffs and stuff like that. [Our composing is] very attention to detail focused—getting the sequencing of each song exactly corrected. The lyrics will be revised 100 million different times. We really really really try to put our all into it, to make sort of f---ed-up masterpieces. And in this writing zone it’s kind of all or nothing, where we all work and we’re here for like weeks at a time. For “Eraser Stargazer” it was like three-four weeks of just like only playing music. We made big family dinners together and watched movies at night. It was pretty much like working all day. That’s the way it’s always been as a band. It’s been kind of like this crazy runaway train kind of thing, where we’ve toured like so many times, and our lives just completely revolve around this band in a really we’re like. We’re all like this really weird f---ed-up family.
THC: What inspires you all, as a band, musically?
KC: I read a lot of books and listen to other people’s music. We’ve seen a lot of shows, a lot of music together, over the years. Sometimes the words for songs will come out of some really intense dream that I have at night. Like the words for “Realistic Rabbit” on “Flood Dosed”—I was having a really hard time trying to find the words to that song, for some reason, nothing seemed right that I was writing, and then I had this dream about a rabbit that was coming out of a butterfly’s chrysalis, and I woke up and I was just like “Woah” and I just wrote all the lyrics to the song right away. And that was super powerful….I guess being here in this really beautiful place, where all the moss is super green. When we were here last year, there were two or three feet of snow, the whole time, and that was obviously a really heavy experience, because it was hard to get anywhere. To remove the snow and go for a walk was a huge deal because the snow was above our knees. Leaving and coming back up to the mountain was really super crazy. We had a van and it wasn’t really very good in the snow, so like farmer people had to come and tow us out. And they were like “Oh geez, these city people again.”….I used to work at Harvard for a long time in the Natural History Museum and that was super cool. I think that was an inspiration as well….There’s all those taxidermy stuff everywhere. A lot of the time I’d work at events, like at night too, so I’d come into work and it would be all these dimly lit—sometimes with the lights off—taxidermied scary animals….It’s beautiful, even the bad taxidermy that was done over one hundred years ago. There’s this tiger taxidermy that looks like it has this big giant frown on it, like the way that someone did it, they didn’t really know how to do it. And then there’s other ones with giant seams with giant stitches, that are coming apart at the seams….And [I’m also inspired by] the detail of the Peabody museum. There was an Art of War exhibit that was just getting put in at the time I was there. It was just really beautiful to see all the Pacific Islands representations of armor and stuff that they did. There’s one—I can’t remember the specific island—the person had a fish helmet that was on his head, a whole chest-piece with all these shark teeth sewn onto it, really intricately and beautifully, and a shark-tooth sword….In the main floor of the Peabody, there’s this room that’s a Native American area. It feels humid in the room and there’s all this music going on and nature sounds, and it feels like you are in this really intense, beautiful environment. I think that’s what a lot of the record is about, taking those moments that are super visceral and describing every little microscopic bit of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nowadays, stories about (multiple of 10)-somethings in New York City form a cliché unto themselves. The title of Kristopher Jansma’s second novel, “Why We Came to the City,” reminds us that such stories were not always tropes, and works to unearth the countless rich textures beneath the city’s seemingly well-worn surfaces. Jansma directly confronts the title’s question in three freewheeling prose poems, which serve as preface (“Why We Came to the City”), halfway point (“Why We Left the City”), and prologue (“The City That Is”) for the story itself. “We came to the city because we wished to live haphazardly, to reach for only the least realistic of desires, and to see if we could not learn what our failures had to teach, and not, when we came to live, discover that we had never died,” he begins the book. This swirling, almost mythological image of a collective “us” proves to be enticing. The novel itself, however, never quite succeeds in creating characters as enthralling as the promise of them.
“We” comprises five college classmates—artist Irene Richmond, poet/psychiatric ward worker Jacob Blaumann, astronomist George Murphy, editor Sara Sherman, and analyst William Cho (all aspiring, uncertain, overworked)—who reunite at a glitzy Manhattan party in December 2008 as the economy plummets. A few days later, Irene is diagnosed with bone cancer. Presented in two parts, the novel first narrates Irene’s battle with the disease, then recounts her friends’ struggles with the aftermath.
Irene’s immediately looming illness thrusts the reader in the middle of an ostensibly fully developed, complex set of friendships. “Surely,” thinks Irene, “Sara would let them take out both her eyes to save one of [mine]. Jacob and George would carry [me] to and from chemo appointments on their backs if [I] asked.” The first half of the novel, unfortunately, fails to convince us of this. It struggles with its expository juggling act, and any cynical reader could pigeonhole the characters: Irene, the mysterious, manic-pixie “doe-eyed” artist; William, the shy, insecure Korean boy in finance, whom Jansma goes so far as to have Irene repeatedly call “girlish"; Jacob, the broke, melodramatic, irreverent, homosexual poet; and Sara, the manically-scheduled office-queen socialite. George—a Midwestern Catholic “cornflower-blue”-eyed astronomist on the verge of an official alcohol problem—has, perhaps, the most depth out of them all. But we never see enough of the characters beyond their immediate and overwhelming trial by cancer. William especially feels like an inconsistently characterized plot device: one day so nervous he almost completely butchers a date with Irene; the next, bold enough to introduce her to his parents and walk into her apartment uninvited.
The language of Jansma’s third-person omniscient narration contributes to the transparent, stretched-too-thin feeling of the exposition. Since Jansma chooses not to describe any of the friend group’s formative college memories, he must do it through forcibly interjected snippets of verbal and mental flashbacks. During these interludes, the third-person omniscient voice does not vary much in showing the internal monologue of each character, perhaps taxed by simultaneously developing five of them. The prose itself often feels stilted: It intersperses lyrical, original images with more hackneyed expressions and colloquial Millennialisms (“Sara had been through three hundred hoops to make sure they have permission…”) and retains the occasional superfluous adjective or adverb—as if, like the narrative, the language were a bit overeager yet overworked.
The switch to close-third perspective in Part II gives Jansma the opportunity to develop both characters and language. The novel’s most redeeming characterization emerges here in the form of a revitalized, trope-shattering Jacob. Driven by the conviction that he “owed it to Irene” to live reasonably, Jacob begins to resolve his relationships with his lover, friends, career, and poetry. The book’s most tender and realistically three-dimensional friendship—which is saying something, since this is a book about friendship—occurs between Jacob and a gifted psychiatric ward patient for whom he serves as a poetry mentor. Jacob’s story is sometimes sentimental, but never saccharine.
Jansma loses this momentum after the Jacob section. Even given the possibilities close-third perspective opens up, William, Sara, and George do not fare so well. William remains defined by Irene: The entirety of his stint in Part II is a scavenger hunt in Irene’s past that Jansma frames, in an overt and awkward Homerian device, as a quest to discover and “return to” the real Irene. While embarking upon this journey entails a certain resolve, William never grows beyond it and regresses into relative shapelessness of character. Sara and George’s brand-new marriage becomes strained, in one of the novel’s most egregiously heavy-handed gestures, by George’s habit of drunkenly falling asleep with Irene’s urn in his arms. With this remaining cast, unlike with Jacob, Jansma falls back on the improperly established foundation of their deep attachment to Irene. Consequently, the events feel more like a mechanical execution of plot than a genuine sequence of events.
When the book ends, it’s not completely clear how and why we end up there. There is Irene’s loss, but Irene remains hazily defined, unknowable. There is the promise of that stunning first line, the haphazardness, desires, and failure of which is not always evoked in the tales of Jansma’s characters. It is clear, however, that watching Irene die breaks and reshapes each character. If the author does not manage in the scope of these relationships to truly answer the question of why we came to the city, he at least generates a genuine sympathy for the protagonists—these people who, constrained as they may sometimes be, are so poignantly and understandably lost in the city.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The other day, I was speaking with a friend about finance. I’m interested in a career in public service, so my nuanced position on the issue was pretty predictable: “Finance is bad. Very, very bad. I hate everyone in finance. Bad banks are powerful and ruin economies and are bad. Bad, bad, bad, bad.”
Having actually done a finance internship, my friend had more optimistic and more informed perspective:
“Financial institutions are powerful. Therefore, you want good people working for them. So it’s good that many Harvard graduates pursue finance.”
As I walked away from our conversation, grumbling, I thought about his statement: Are Harvard students truly “good people?"
“Good” has two sorts of meaning in this context. The first is that Harvard students have good technical skills. As a person with a statistics secondary who has a seen a statistically significant number of people beat me on the curve of almost every exam I take, I’d say Harvard students are probably pretty “good” in this way.
It’s the other version of “good” that leaves me doubtful: moral good. It’s the good that stops greed from blinding the judgment of big banks, preventing them from breaking the law or taking unwarranted risks that threaten the livelihoods of others.
So, are Harvard students morally good?
I can’t really see how our admissions process could screen for morality. Nor can I think of a reason why a Harvard education itself would make our students, on average, more moral than other college students. Sure, the Gen Ed program aims to make us good “citizens.” But what the hell does that even mean? What does being a good citizen even look like?
Harvard never really seems to take a stance. As Dean Khurana says, over and over again, our education is meant to be “transformative.” But are all transformations good ones?
In the 1800s, seniors at Harvard would end their college careers with a capstone course from the University President on moral philosophy and living “the good life.” However, after the rise of Darwinism and other strains of thought that shook the foundations of “objective” Enlightenment/Victorian moral philosophy, Harvard did away with its capstone courses and, eventually, its moral education (see Hist 1330 on this topic, offered next spring).
It’s easy to see that this trend of amorality persists today. Our classes on morality involve debates between utilitarianism, communitarianism, Kantianism, and every other -ism in the book. In the humanities and social sciences, everything is a debate. And there is no sense that, through our debates, we approach any objective sense of morality. Instead, our classes train us to critically analyze and pick apart any and all moral arguments. Professors often pride themselves on the fact that students walk out with more questions than when they walked in.
In the community of strict scrutinizers we’ve created, every action has consequences. Making a commitment to volunteer in Africa becomes an act of paternalism. Inventing an online tool becomes an attack on personal privacy. Training to become the first woman to reach Mars becomes an effort to waste public funds.
Don’t get me wrong: Strict scrutiny is good. Critical thought allows us to assess the consequences of our actions, giving us a clearer picture of the most effective ways to act and carry out our goals.
But, I also think scrutiny can easily lead to apathy. If every action has negative consequences, if every systematic reform can be picked apart, if there is not even a single compelling way to act or live “the good life,” then what’s the point in using our education to serve others and to better the world?
Part of Harvard College’s mission statement is to help students learn “how they can best serve the world.” Instead, Harvard trains us to see the infinite ways we can’t serve the world.
After such an education, if Harvard really wants us to make a positive difference, it cannot simply tell us to do so. Rather, it has to actively convince us that our lives are best spent in service to others. In other words, Harvard needs to take a stance. It needs to return to its moral education.
The recently proposed General Education reforms seem to be taking steps in the right direction. But Harvard needs to go further. Specifically, it needs to ditch Gen Eds, bring back distribution requirements, and bring on the triumphant return of compulsory capstone courses—one for freshmen and one for seniors. These classes could bring in lecturers who spend hours over the course of a semester making a case for bettering the world through the private, public, and academic sectors. Successful leaders in many fields could expose students to examples of how, say, the satisfaction of owning a yacht pales in comparison to the satisfaction of receiving constant respect and gratitude from others because of  one’s work. They could expose us to urgent problems that inspire our compassionate hearts and problem-solving minds.
These courses could forge our class into a community that takes ownership of one mission: to use the tools we’ve been given to better the world. We may not agree on how to pursue that mission, but I think every religion and humanist ideology on campus would agree that we must pursue it. Then, and only then, could we even suggest that “good” Harvard graduates run the most powerful institutions in the world—financial or otherwise.
With so much at stake, it is immoral to remain amoral. We must have a moral education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last December, Harvard students were told that the name of the House masters simply had to go. In a whirlwind process, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana acceded to the late November demands of a group of Latino students not even two weeks after they were delivered. These students had argued that associations with slavery made the title untenable. In formalizing the change a couple weeks later, Dean Khurana added his nuanced opinion: the rationale made sense on “very many levels.”
Only yesterday did we have the chance to plumb the depths of these levels. After a “long, thoughtful, and wide-ranging debate” lasting three months, our former House Masters shall instead be called "Faculty Deans."
Unfortunately, now having the rationale in hand, our position is unchanged. We opposed the change then, and we oppose it now.
This debate has been so unfortunate in part because this process has been so torturous. Having assumed for three months that we were grappling with the legacy of slavery, an email to all students from Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith today told us otherwise.
In a strikingly upfront but confusingly counterproductive fashion, Dean Smith slowly but surely demolishes the case for the change he is about to announce. It is true, he admits, that the history and etymology of the phrase “House Master” are singularly unproblematic.  It is true that he has never seen “any direct connection between the term House Master and the institution of slavery.” And it is true that the College is “proud” of the title it will, two paragraphs later, discard. But never fear: change is here.
We surmise then that the administration has spent the better part of the last three months with two separate tasks: devising a new honorific and discovering a new rationale. It is a pity, then, that neither are readily apparent. Only in the penultimate paragraph do we unearth that the position the email describes 10 separate times as “House leader” is actually the “Faculty Dean.” And nowhere whatsoever do we find any clearly stated rationale for the abolishment of a century-old tradition.
In a long email filled with high-minded rhetoric (it references “intellectual, social, and personal” growth twice), we are instead left to piece together clues to the University’s intent based on copy-and-pasted mission statements and PR platitudes. It emerges that the term “House Masters” is too antiquated and gender-specific to be workable. Perhaps more significantly, the email hints and subtly implies that the emotional health of our fellow students are at stake.
Semantics aside, these are not terrible rationales. They certainly are the best of a bad lot. It is true that House masters were not addressed as such by their students, and the nomenclature comes from a time before Harvard became co-educational. Our world evolves, Harvard evolves, and we evolve with it, thus arriving at this compromise to alleviate the discomfort of parts of the student body.
Yet it is striking that in their official justification for altering an age-old title, it is left to the reader to engage in email announcement exegesis. It seems that having email-blasted-out their intent to rename the position, administrators could hardly retreat having discovered that their “very many” reasons were not actually so numerous. Instead, they chose to muddle through nearly 700 words in the hope the lack of substance would be missed.
Unfortunately, the mishandled process also produced a misleading title. “Faculty Dean,” née “House Master,” misses the point of accurately describing their role. Dean Smith writes that the Faculty Deans must be everything from “hands-on managers” to “community builders” to “pastoral advisors.” To us, leaders needing to switch between the responsibilities of in loco parentis and the pulpit do not sound like “Faculty Deans.” The cumbersome new term invokes administration and academics, not house life.
At some level, despite having botched the announcement and butchered the rationale, administrators have eventually chosen a new and permanent name. On another level, this has felt like Harvard’s New Coke: change for the sake of change. When the dust settles, we will have been left with a title that is ironically even less suited to the demands of the job.

Imagine if one of Harvard’s schools chose Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, or Bernie Sanders as its commencement speaker in the midst of the 2016 campaign season. Such a selection would not only raise eyebrows, but it would also threaten the university’s tax-exempt status—IRS rules prohibit non-profit organizations like Harvard from engaging in partisan, election-related activities. By law, any event giving a platform to political hopefuls must be carefully organized as a multi-candidate forum.
Beyond the question of what is legal, it would be wrong for a university administration to tilt the balance towards any one presidential candidate. A university is supposed to be a place for us to cultivate our critical thinking skills, a place where we can freely express and debate political ideas. When faculty deans—who make decisions about hiring and firing faculty, and about distributing funding—appear to take sides rather than encourage open discussion, it is tantamount to a restriction on academic freedom. Faculty, staff, and students who want to support Secretary Clinton’s political opponents, either in the context of academic debate or participation in campaign organization, may think twice if they perceive that the administration holds an opposing position. In an environment where people must compete for promotions, tenure, and financial aid, many of our community members would rather avoid conflict with those in power.
But what if the commencement speaker were not a presidential candidate, but a 40-year confidant of a presidential candidate and the head of that candidate’s eponymous foundation? That is the question raised by Acting Dean David Hunter’s decision to invite Donna Shalala, president of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, as the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s 2016 Commencement speaker. Dean Hunter invited Shalala despite concerns raised by Chan School student government leaders over email, who told him that the selection would amount to a tacit political endorsement. The announcement was made on Feb. 24, less than a week before the Massachusetts primary, and noted the Clinton Foundation affiliation in the first sentence of his email.
Shalala met the Clintons before they married in 1975. She served as director of the Children’s Defense Fund, coinciding with Hillary Clinton’s tenure as a board member from 1986 to 1992. Shalala then served as Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001. At a 2014 event held at University of Miami, where Shalala served as president, she and Hillary Clinton hugged and the former Secretary of State went on to share stories about their friendship.
A month after Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy, Shalala left her position at University of Miami to become director of the Clinton Foundation. Shalala took the reins at a time when the organization had been dogged by negative publicity concerning infighting and conflicts of interest. She likely took a substantial pay cut to work for the Clintons: Shalala earned nearly $1 million dollars at University of Miami in 2014, whereas the outgoing president of the Clinton Foundation earned closer to $500,000 that same year.
Shalala has a wealth of leadership experience in the fields of health care advocacy and administration. She has taken principled positions in her career, serving as a voice of internal dissent during Bill Clinton’s 1996 welfare reform initiative, which restricted access to public benefits and healthcare. In any other year, it would be an honor to have her speak at the Chan School’s commencement. But this year we must, as a school of public health, be able to have an open and ongoing conversation about our country’s political future. This can only happen if our institution maintains official neutrality. Given Shalala’s extremely close ties to a presidential candidate during an election year, Dean Hunter should apologize to her, rescind the invitation, and ask her to come back in 2017.

“I would recommend that everyone wear a cloak at some point in their lives. It gives you this weird sense of confidence and you kind of feel like a badass.”
Hailing from San Juan, Puerto Rico, Norman R. Storer ’19 is often spotted on campus (and, occasionally, on the Ivy League Snapstory) wearing a long black cloak, resembling that of Jon Snow from the television series “Game of Thrones.” FM caught up with Storer to meet the man behind the cape—and to steal some style secrets.
Fifteen Minutes: So, you’ve often been spotted wearing a long black cloak around campus. Where’d it come from and why do you wear it?
Norman Storer: Well, first of all, I made it. I work a bit with leather, wood, metal. That started actually... because I used to make belts for my pirate costumes and little pouches for money and stuff. I would make stuff to sell to my family—wallets, purses, bracelets, that kind of stuff. So anyways, during the summer before I came here, I was already contemplating that it was going to be very, very cold. I’d heard about the legendary 2014-2015 winter, and I was like: “Winter is coming.”… I’m a big fan of “Game of Thrones,” so I decided to make myself a Jon Snow cloak.
FM: I notice you are also wearing a kilt.
NR: Well, so my first kilt was—I mean is, because I still have it—a Utilikilt... It’s a brown utility kilt with big cargo pockets. It’s so cool... I’m a really big fan of Irish and Scottish music... and then I saw kilts and I was like, “Yo, I need one of those.” And then I saw the Utilikilt and was like, “Yo, that’s actually useful, ’cause it has pockets!” So then I got that... and a year later, I got this kilt, which is a semi-traditional kilt. I hope to get a proper thick woolen quilt soon, so I can properly face the Boston winter.
FM: Do you have a story about a time when someone recognized you for your clothing?
NS: Well, once I was walking—about a week or two ago—when it snowed. And I was walking around with the cloak here in the plaza and some... tourists made signs at me... I thought it was for me to take a photo of them, and I was like, “Of course, sure!” And then I’m waiting for someone to give me a camera, as they get close to me. But then they just stand at my side, and I see the other guy with a camera, and I’m like, “Oh, okay!”
FM: How does it feel when people stop you for pictures or just take pictures of you in general?
NS: I like to think that I don’t care about what people think of me, and that’s sort of true. I also do kind of get a guilty pleasure from knowing that people are like, “What the fuck is he wearing?” I kind of have a hard time not smiling when I notice people looking at me. I just walk, and I’m like: [he smirks].

“Well I was a high rigger for a long time,” the man said. “About 25 years, working in all the plants around here, and let me tell you there’s no scarier job, when you’re up there and the walkway starts to jerk around and you look and see the whole thing’s dangling from just a lynch pin and maybe some zip ties”—he laughed—“well Christ! You’ve got to jump, your body just says jump, and you do, and grab onto something and hope it all holds up.”
I’d been summoned to the local post of the American Legion by some friends, and once there I’d sat down at the bar—an expanse of knotted, pitted, ringed wood much-lacquered with beer—on an empty stool between one of my hoodie-clad and smoking friends and the man who was now expounding on his dream. I didn’t quite know how it had come up.
He tamped his cigarette out in a beige plastic ashtray and teased another from his pack of Marlboro Reds. Before he lit it, he took a gulp of some mysterious intoxicant from a Styrofoam cup.
“I gotta tell you,” he said, “I still have dreams about it, like I’m falling, but this one—this one’s the worst. Honestly it had never happened to me before, but when I had this dream I woke up in a cold sweat, and I didn’t even know what that meant, until I woke up in a cold sweat. And I haven’t had it again, that dream, but it’s all I ever think about now, and sometimes when I wake up it’s in a cold sweat, not because I had the dream, but just because I’d been thinking about it, in whatever I was dreaming. Do you get that?”
I think I nodded at him. I felt like one of those nameless listeners in a Conrad novel, the reclining conciliatory shades that begin the work in a nebulous third-person narration and quickly cede the power of speech to a greater raconteur. Somehow—with his talk of a feeling like dread, which felt out of place in a bar—this withered onetime rigger had intruded on my night. He seemed to promise something strange. I told him to go on.
“Oh, it’ll sound wild. It’s in a, it’s like a—what would you call it—a compound. That’s where I am. It’s so big I can’t see outside of it, just all sorts of sand, I guess we’re out in a desert somewhere. There are trucks everywhere, big dirt-moving trucks, and a couple of rows of fences with barbed wire up on top; it’s a nasty place. I just came out of a big sheet-metal building, that’s when the dream starts. And something’s strange, something feels evil about it. I look to my right and there’s a semi and its bed is full of prostitutes…”
“Prostitutes?”
“Exactly.” By this time my friend had bowed out in the aptly impolite way of all bargoers: He had simply drifted off. “A semi full of prostitutes, and I can tell that they’re up to no good. I think they’re trying to trick us; they’re up there on the bed of the semi looking good and moving themselves about, and I start to notice there are other guys leaving the same building I’d just left, and they’re wandering over to the prostitutes—but before they reach them, guards come up, and take them away.”
His hands made strophes as he spoke, held up before him as though he were preparing to be handcuffed, one wielding the lambent baton of his dwindling cigarette, which dragged and glowed and stippled the gloom.
“So I’m starting to get scared. I’m thinking: Shit! And I’m starting to put two and two together, and it seems to me that one of them shahs has set himself up a sort of ‘Hunger Games’ type thing, out there in Saudi Arabia, like he put all his money into this fancy-ass compound and now he’s gonna start killing all the workers. Like me.”
I didn’t laugh, but I wanted to. The whole story was so grotesque, the dream-images so blunt, so clearly xenophobia-fueled, that it seemed as if the collective psyche of the region had cracked open for a moment, and spilled its petty fears like half-priced beer on the bar before me.
“But,” he continues, “I haven’t seen anyone die. Yet. And as soon as I think that I turn around and there’s the strangest thing: a kid crawling out from the bed of a truck—I guess the bed was just a plywood sheet—and he’s squeezing himself out from under it like some sort of bug. He’s blonde; he’s got long blonde hair, all sweaty with the heat. And the moment he gets his torso free—whoom!—out of nowhere those same guards rush up. And they stab him. They’ve got long knives, those scimitar things, and they’re just stabbing away at him, and the kid’s screaming, and trying to move, and I think: Jesus! I start to feel sick. I start to run over to the kid, I think I’m gonna help him, but then I see him go limp; somebody got him right in the neck”—he motions savagely with his hand—“cut the spinal cord clean in two. And then someone grabs me, says, ‘You’ve got to come with me if you want to get out of here alive.’ And then I wake up.”
We sit silently. I note he has a very large nose, rubicund and pitted like a colander: engorged with spirits. A baseball cap bearing an arcane logo covers his short gray hair. I ask him about the blonde kid, if there was anything else to him, and he says yes, very strangely there was. He was wearing a blue construction hat. “And I’ve been on enough jobs, I’ve seen yellow hats and red hats, but I’ve never worked for a company with a blue hat. Not once.”
I tell him that I’m pretty sure United Nations peacekeepers wear blue helmets, and I pull out my phone and draw up a picture—in this age when our dreams can be researched, read, in a moment—and confirm that yes, they do.
He looks at the picture and scratches his forehead, dislodging his cap, and then, hardly interested at all, as though I’d missed the point entirely, he says: “Now that’s something to think about.”

As I sit in my room in Leverett Tower and look across the river, it occurs to me that despite having lived in this city nearly four years, the fraction of that time I’ve spent off campus is extraordinarily small—a realization I’d venture to guess is common at Harvard. After a few conversations with friends, the itinerary is set. We are going to explore the world beyond. A quick Google search tells us Brighton Ave. is the place to go, and so we set out, lacking any definite plan but having one singular goal: Experience something new.
PATRON'S
We tell our Lyft driver to take us to Brighton Ave., and he drops us off outside Patron’s, a Mexican restaurant known for its tacos and margaritas. After a brief pause for ID checks and the subsequent acquisition of bright orange bracelets, we climb narrow stairs and emerge into an upstairs bar with a comfortable atmosphere. The place boasts three connected rooms, set up in a gradient from mellow to hardcore. The first, brightly lit, consists mainly of pool tables with diner-style booths all around. The second is a bar, decorated with neon signs and bold paintings on every available surface. The final is lit only by strobe lights and a tiny, rave-like dance floor.
The wait for a pool table is almost an hour, so we spend most of our time at the bar. Despite the fact that it’s mid-February, chalkboards strewn about say “Happy New Year.” I ask about the theme, but the bartender shrugs and asks if I want anything to drink. One-dollar drafts, $2 mystery shots, and $3 Jell-O shots are displayed prominently atop the menu. Feeling adventurous, we all accept the mystery shots (which taste precisely like children’s cough syrup) and buy dollar drafts for good measure.
COMMON GROUND
Back on the street, we see an enormous line outside a bar called Common Ground. Someone in line tells us that it’s ’90s night, so, eager to feel nostalgic, we decide to join the queue. We pay a $5 cover, and, upon entering, we’re met with a wave of heat and a crowded room full of ’90s enthusiasts. There are no special cocktails that we can see, so we grab some beer on tap and head to the dance floor. On the way past the DJ, we see a stack of CDs—The Backstreet Boys’ “Black and Blue” at the very top—and I can’t help but smile. One hour and many ’90s songs later, we tear ourselves away from childhood and back to 2016, and we know it’s time to move on.
SILHOUETTE LOUNGE
The next place we check out is a little dive bar called the Silhouette Lounge. The motto is “Your Neighborhood Place,” and the dress is casual—it’s clear that people are here to spend time with friends. Customers mostly cluster around tables to talk, while some in the back shoot pool or play darts. This crowd is also a little younger than the others, and there’s not much inter-group mingling. Our highlight of the night comes in the form of a free gift: We’re handed a basket of complimentary popcorn when we order drinks. After munching on the popcorn and joking around with the stern-faced but surprisingly good-humored bouncer, we’re on our way out.
TAVERN IN THE SQUARE
The last stop of the night is a Harvard Square export: Tavern in the Square, Allston-style. The demographic is college-aged, the dress is fancy, and the music is significantly more modern than any of the other establishments we’ve entered tonight. A skinny man in glasses weaves through the center of the dance floor, lifting a fishbowl full of blue liquid and multicolored straws above our heads. Numerous TV screens cater to those hoping to catch a game, while the dance floor caters to those hoping to show off some game of their own.
It feels somehow complete to finish the night with fellow college students, bringing our foray into the adult world full circle. But all adventures must end eventually, and, after a time, we head back into the land of the familiar.

Last year, the Harvard College Women’s Center received an anonymous donation: dozens of yellowed back issues of Seventh Sister, a now-discontinued monthly publication formerly produced by Radcliffe College sudents.
According to its mission statement, the magazine “focus[ed] primarily on concerns of women in the [Harvard-Radcliffe] community.” The issues date back to the Seventh Sister’s founding in the spring of 1976.
The Seventh Sister’s etymology dates back to the 1879 founding of the Harvard Annex, developed as a compromise after Harvard officials refused to integrate women into the University itself. The institution was renamed Radcliffe College in 1894, and it quickly became a prominent member of an association of women’s liberal arts colleges colloquially termed the “Seven Sisters.” The Seven Sisters also included Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Smith, Mount Holyoke, and Vassar colleges.
The magazine set out to accomplish three main goals: to discuss events and issues of interest to women; to provide space for open and wide participation among the different student groups on campus; and to create a collaborative environment where women could learn the inner workings of running a newspaper. The magazine prided itself on its inclusivity, stating that, “Any member of the Radcliffe community is welcome to become a staff member—we have no comp.”
The magazine focused on fostering a sense of sisterhood among its members; the publication had no president. Instead, every choice was made collectively by the whole group.
In a statement for the December 1977 issue of the Radcliffe Quarterly, Susan Comstock ’78, one of the founders of the Seventh Sister, wrote “We wanted to do something collectively, to prove to ourselves that we didn’t have to run a newspaper in a hierarchical way.”
The magazine addressed many of the controversies of the 1970s and 1980s, with headlines like “Sex Role Straightjackets,” “Women Against Pornography,” “Beyond Guilt: A White Woman Confronts Racism,” “Senior Juggles Midterms and Motherhood at 21,” and “Over Educated and Underpaid: 7 Harvard Secretaries.”
The magazine also featured sports and movie review sections and frequently published poetry, photographs, and other submissions from its contributors. Its articles were direct and often passionate, openly criticizing the school’s administration and its treatment of minorities on campus.
Some women felt marginalized by the magazine’s unapologetic approach. As Elizabeth Owens ’80 wrote in the September 1980 issue of the Radcliffe Quarterly, “Many undergraduates feel that this publication speaks only to the feminist woman.” According to Owens, some Radcliffe students dismissed the magazine out of fear of being associated with “militant feminism.”
“Women who are more moderate feminists just do not seem to be affiliating themselves with such organizations,” Owens wrote. “We see the advantages of linking ourselves with the old-boy network, and we do this by associating ourselves with Harvard, not Radcliffe.”
Many writers for the Seventh Sister, however, felt differently. They believed that a strong, feminine environment fostered growth for its members. They believed that Radcliffe women needed solidarity to combat the presence of anti-feminist stereotypes like the “Cliffie Bitch,” described in a 1978 issue of The Independent as “myopic, cold and unemotional.”
“By any standards, to be called a Cliffie Bitch is insulting. But it’s also the most back-handed of compliments,” Tanya Luhrmann wrote in Seventh Sister in November of that year. “So-called bitchiness is a by-product of a woman’s intelligence and power; the equivalent of bitchiness in a man may be deplored, but would generally be overlooked.”
Harvard’s collection of Seventh Sister magazines ends abruptly with an issue from March 1984, roughly a decade and a half before Radcliffe formally merged with Harvard. Copies can be found in a yellow manila envelope in the basement of Canaday, at the Women’s Center.
You can also find the Seventh Sister online in the Schlesinger  archives.

An impressive cloud of scent stops me on my way down the south side of Mt. Auburn. I freeze and inhale again, doubting my senses. Is that incense? Eucalyptus? Some new blend of potpourri?
Looking for a source, I squint across the street at the plate-glass storefront of Insomnia Cookies. Eh, maybe.
I look to my right, noticing the sunken cement staircase there for the first time. At the bottom, a heavily tagged door seeps pale smoke and thumping base. A dangling black-and-white sign marks the entrance to In Your Ear Records Ltd. I follow my nose into the shop.
Inside, I find the ’70s. Black Sabbath howls on vinyl in the corner. Bon Jovi and Def Leppard scowl out from crates of CDs and 45s. A man in a checkered cap cradles a bulky cell phone behind the cash register, chatting softly above the volume of the store. I browse through racks of jazz and grunge, tempted to buy a record despite my lack of a record player, then approach the counter.
I tell Albie, who wears the checkered cap, that I’m curious about this place and its music, and he calls out the owner, Mark Henderson, from the back. Henderson clears a stack of CDs from the counter and leans against it as he talks.
As he tells it, In Your Ear started with a crate of scratched records and a sidewalk. In the late ’70s, Henderson began working for Déjà Vu Records, an indie music store on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Mt. Auburn with a strategy of selling “guerilla-style” down by MIT.  “[A co-worker] guided me in his car down to MIT, showed me where to set up, and put a bunch of records out there. We probably got kicked off [the street] after two or three hours,” Henderson says. “There’s a long tradition of street records in Cambridge.”
Eventually, Henderson and a partner bought inventory and a van and started selling on their own. In 1982, they opened their first In Your Ear; today, they and a third partner run stores in Cambridge, Boston, and Rhode Island.
Despite the store’s rapid growth, however, the process of collecting music remains distinctly personal: In Your Ear’s inventory is dependent upon what locals are willing to buy and sell. Though Henderson and his staff do curate for quality, in theory they’ll buy almost anything from the people who walk through the door. “[We stock] the history of recorded music,” Henderson says, adding, “We do get a little flotsam and jetsam along the way. It’s part of the panache around here.”
Judging by his excitement, he is as proud of his misses as he is of his hits. In fact, as Henderson goes on, I begin to suspect that he considers his work as much an exercise in history as in retail.
“To us, the holy grail, the reason for living, is when a good record comes in the door. There’s nothing like it.” He is gushing. “Especially collections.… It’s just seeing how a person’s compiled their collection. [It’s not] just random selections of stuff.”
Though he ultimately dissembles all the collections that he buys, Henderson does not mourn their loss. Instead, he finds value in their exchange, in the fleeting bond they create between buyer and seller. “If you’re looking at it, archiving it—you learn about someone. It’s amazing.”
“I wonder what my collection will look like,” he muses. Looking around at this psychedelic, overflowing, gorgeous time capsule of a store, I think I already know.

“How can I get into Harvard?” high school students worldwide asked Sophia D. Chua-Rubenfeld ’15. “Can you help me?”
In the aftermath of her mother’s controversial parenting book “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,” then-Harvard freshman Chua-Rubenfeld’s mailbox was running out of space. Suddenly the poster child for college admissions success, Chua-Rubenfeld received pleas for guidance on some students’ ultimate goal: Harvard acceptance.
After graduating, Chua-Rubenfeld and her cousin, Amalia Halikas, Yale Class of 2015, started Tiger Cub Tutoring (TCT). The company, which borrows Chua-Rubenfeld’s nickname from her mother’s book, boasts 20 tutors and more than 100 clients. TCT set out to provide academic tutoring, college consulting, and standardized test prep to students across the country. Four years later,  Chua-Rubenfeld is answering those pleas.
TCT is just one of many student-run college admissions consulting businesses springing up across the nation. Unsurprisingly, it’s also just one of many student-run college admissions consulting businesses at Harvard. While student admissions counselors provide a unique perspective for a lower price than established firms, they lack the experience of professional college counselors and the data to substantiate their services.
GROWING A STUDENT BUSINESS
“We started out meeting on the second floor of Panera every week,” Samuel Z. Huang ’18, Chief Financial Officer of Harvard Square College Consulting (HSCC), explains. Founded last year by Huang and two friends, the student-run HSCC provides Skype-based college admissions counseling.
Huang, along with Yehong Zhu ’18, an inactive FM editor, and Dominic Akandwanaho ’16, said they aimed to help meet the increasing demand from high schoolers seeking college admissions guidance.
“We wanted to help out people who have a really good shot at applying to competitive colleges and who just need more resources,” Huang says. Most new student-run services grow from this same professed intention: providing equal opportunities for students of all backgrounds.
“We are offering really, really high quality tutoring, but are knocking a zero off of what most people charge,” Chua-Rubenfeld says. Established test prep companies, which charge up to hundreds of dollars per hour for counseling, are often inaccessible to students from lower-income families. Meanwhile, one hour at a student-run company can cost about $60.
Conscious of the disparity in access to college counseling services, both HSCC and TCT offer pro-bono services to low-income clients on top of their already discounted prices.
“What we’re looking for is the kid who has really big dreams… and just doesn’t have the resources or family background to get that on their own,” Chua-Rubenfeld says. TCT aims to build a clientele of which at least 10 percent qualify for financial aid.
Worthy goals aside, these companies are, at their core, businesses. The Ivy League names help, too.
THE IVY ADVANTAGE
According to college admissions expert Parke P. Muth, it isn’t an accident that these businesses pop up at the most elite schools in the country. Muth observes that “the majority of the [student-run services] that I’ve ever looked at front and center have Mr. Smith from Harvard, Mr. Jones from Yale, Ms. Jackson from Stanford. The usual suspects. That’s their advertising.”
Both services take full advantage of Ivy League branding. Tiger Cub’s website offers the chance to “bring Harvard and Yale to your laptop today!” HSCC’s ensures visitors that their staff of almost 20 Harvard undergraduates is “the cream of the crop” and presents the crests of all eight Ivies on their home page.
If Harvard’s stamp of approval wasn’t enough to attract clients, TCT and HSCC aren’t shy about listing their staff members’ accolades. High school valedictorians, 2400 SAT recipients, National Merit scholars, and National AP Scholars abound on HSCC and TCT’s tutor profiles.
Chua-Rubenfeld says that the Ivy League pedigree “definitely gives some credibility.” It also gives them access to a niche customer base. HSCC tutors students from California to New York, and both groups target clients from China. HSCC has Chinese partners who send them students, and TCT has a Chinese version of its website that offers tutoring for the TOEFL, the common app-required English language test.
These companies’ client bases stem from Ivy League reputations. Questions remain, however, about whether they deliver on their promises.
CONFIDENCE BEFORE CURRICULUM
Student-run college consulting services advertise their commitment to individual learning styles. For the most part, tutors develop their own curriculum.
“We give them a really, really wide latitude,” Chua-Rubenfeld says. Many student tutors have experience with other test prep or college consulting organizations, and HSCC provides tutors with a training document containing tips for students. Ultimately, though, there is no formal training for services like TCT and HSCC.
“They are very trusting of their tutors, and of their ability to cater curriculum to individual students,” says Taylor Kay Phillips ’15, a tutor at TCT.
Joan H. Zhang ’17, another TCT tutor, says TCT is “really trusting that these are high achieving Harvard or Yale students who know what they’re doing.”
This hands-off approach leaves tutors to prep on their own, using online resources to tailor their curriculum to individual clients. “We use online resources, like the College Board. I do research online and then help them through the problems they can’t get,” says Alexander T. Moore, a tutor at HSCC.
Still, TCT has a clear philosophy. According to Chua-Rubenfeld, “99 percent of coaching kids through the college process is just instilling them with confidence.”
Providing confidence turns out to be something almost every tutor emphasizes as one of their main objectives.
“Do my students feel like they are stronger writers? Are they more confident?” Phillips says of her strategies for measuring success.
According to Moore, tutors’ own college admissions memories may remind them how crucial confidence is to an application.
“We just went through the process, so we’re way more familiar with it,” Moore says. Despite this unique perspective, many of the tutors don’t have the qualifications held by most professionals.
THE PROFESSIONAL EDGE
“I was massively unqualified. I’m not an education expert. I didn’t know how to help these kids,” Chua-Rubenfeld admits. Chua-Rubenfeld viewed starting a student-run consulting business as a challenge.
Many professional college counselors join organizations like the National Associations of College Admissions Counselors (NACA) or the International Educational Consultant Association (IECA) that host conferences and workshops on admissions. Here, professionals learn about a wide range of schools and establish relationships with college representatives. Student tutors, by and large, don’t have access to these resources.
Student-run groups draw mostly on their own admissions experiences. According to Muth, these experiences, though relevant for applying to highly selective schools, are less broadly applicable because “95 percent of students who apply to Harvard are not getting in.” Most students, says Muth, “will probably need a wider range of schools to look at.”
Chua-Rubenfeld, though, says that TCT’s services aren’t exclusively focused on Ivies. “We definitely don’t feel that every kid needs to get a 2400 or be a Yale, Harvard, Princeton admit to be successful,” says Chua-Rubenfeld.
Student run groups also don’t yet track and guarantee results the way some of the professional tutoring giants do. Kaplan testing offers a higher score or your money back. The Princeton Review guarantees at least an 100-point improvement on its students’ SAT scores. But for the student-run groups, Zhang notes, “It’s very challenging for them to have a score guarantee because we’re not teaching on a structured system or a plan.”
In place of metrics, these companies rely on a more subjective measure of success: client satisfaction.
“So far I don’t have a lot of hard data. But I have happy students and that’s really important to me,” Chua-Rubenfeld tells us. Both companies are still young; neither has completed a full admissions cycle. Data-driven promises could be a part of their futures.
Even advertised facts, figures, and testimonials, though, may be difficult to fact-check, Muth says.
“There are many websites that list things like the number of their students who have been admitted to certain schools. There is certainly some embellishment going on, as there is very little way these figures could be checked,” Muth wrote in an email.
In HSCC’s case, for example, a website testimonial, ostensibly from a current Harvard freshman, praised the company for “all the guidance I received from HSCC... They helped me see the qualities that made me unique—and illuminated those traits through my application.”
The student in question, though currently a freshman at Harvard, said she never used HSCC’s services. Zhu, one of the HSCC co-founders, hosted the student at Visitas and associated the student’s name with the erroneous quote.
Zhu said she helped the student with “college related activities,” using the student’s name “on the condition that when we did have clients we would replace the reviews with updated reviews [from formal HSCC clients]... We just haven’t had a chance to update the website yet, but I will get to it right away.”
After The Crimson reached out to Zhu for comment, the testimony was removed from the site.
Huang, one of Zhu’s co-founders, declined to comment on the false testimonial. Akandwanaho, the third co-founder, could not be reached for comment.
According to Muth, situations like this aren’t unique to undergraduate-run services.
“It is not just students groups that are misleading families, students and educators,” he says.
While questions still remain about the efficacy of student-run college consulting groups, their rapid growth suggests they aren’t going away anytime soon.
These groups’ ultimate pitch lies in the interaction with “a student who was accepted to college two years ago, versus a person who may have been accepted 30 years ago,” Moore says. “There’s a difference to that.”

On a Thursday morning in February of 1909, Charles William Eliot, President of Harvard University, arrived in Memphis, Tenn. His day began with a leisurely tour through the city followed by a mid-day speech at a women’s club, and ended with an evening lecture at the Goodwyn Institute, a public library and auditorium dedicated to talks on education.
“In all parts of the country, there are problems to be solved that would tend to interfere with our advancement,” Eliot declared, according to a reporter from the Memphis Commercial-Appeal. “In the South it is the Negro problem.” For an audience in the early 20th century South, where Jim Crow racial segregation ruled alongside an epidemic of lynchings, there was little controversy in this statement. Eliot elaborated further.
“The same or similar problems exist in all parts of the country. In Protestant Massachusetts, the land of the Pilgrims and Puritans, the population today is mostly Catholic. There are Irish, Italian, and Portuguese that present the same race problem to that part of the country the Negroes do to the South,” Eliot continued. This statement alone unleashed a series of virulent responses from newspapers across the Northeast.
Tennessee seems an unusual place for Eliot, a 75-year-old Boston Brahmin at the heart of northern intellectualism, but Memphis constituted only one of over two dozen southern cities the Harvard president visited in his nearly seven week University-sponsored tour of the South.
Months prior to this moment, on Oct. 26, 1908, Eliot had submitted his resignation from the Presidency to the Harvard Corporation. Over the course of nearly four decades, Eliot transformed Harvard from a provincial religious institution into a preeminent American research university. He reorganized the professional schools, increased academic scholarship, raised the endowment, and created an elective system of education. He asked that his resignation take effect no later than May 19, 1909, making his trip to the South the capstone of the longest and perhaps most consequential presidency in Harvard’s history.
In Eliot’s mind, the role of President stretched far beyond Cambridge city limits. In a speech near the end of his tour, in Durham, N.C., Eliot made this point clear. “Of course Harvard University aspires to a national resort, to draw students from all over the country,” he said. “It is therefore the business of her President to inform himself about the condition of the institutions of higher education in all parts of the country.” For Eliot, going to the South was an educational experience in itself. As the Harvard Bulletin released to the press explains, “he goes to observe, to study, to learn, and to help, if his help is needed and asked for.”
Despite Eliot’s universalizing rhetoric on his place in society, fundamental to the understanding of this trip is Eliot’s identity as an outsider. The Harvard Bulletin attempted to minimize this status by stating that Eliot “goes to the South, not primarily as a New Englander or as a Harvard man, but as one of the foremost citizens of America, devoted to the cause of education, and to the many complex problems of the American people.”
The controversies that surfaced throughout the trip on issues ranging across politics, education, and race provide a snapshot of Southern society as it looked more than four decades after the Civil War. They also form a portrait of Eliot, revealing his priorities as he stumbled through unfamiliar terrain.
Two weeks after Eliot’s lecture in Memphis, newspaper accounts of the racially charged remarks began to stir backlash. Unaware the imminent controversy, Eliot had already traveled through six other Texan cities and was in residence in New Orleans, La. Eliot’s assistant, Joseph Warren, was telegraphed asking for verification of the quote. Warren confirmed that Eliot had drawn parallels between racial issues in North and South and “did not deny the quotation.”
Meanwhile, northern angst over the alleged statement mounted. On Mar. 6, a Boston newspaper printed an article charging Eliot with “talking altogether too much on every subject.” The paper asserted that Eliot had proven himself “a man who lacks the caution and reserve which denote the sober and well-balanced mind.”
In response, Eliot sent a telegram to Boston. In the brief message, Eliot claimed that he was quoted inaccurately, and that he had actually said, “North and West have their racial suffrage difficulties similar to, though not so intense as, those existing in South.” He included that he was “happy to reply on return if any public interest therein remains.” Only a few days later, after visiting Montgomery, Ala., Eliot again attracted controversy over his statements on race.
Eliot’s stay in Montgomery was short, but while there he sat down for an interview with a reporter. In the interview, Eliot veered back into questions of race, this time addressing intermarriage.
“Each race should maintain its own individuality,” he said. “The experience of civilization shows that racial stocks are never mixed with profit and that such unions do not bring forth the best and strongest children.” Eliot expanded on this by referencing specific racial groups. “I believe, for example, that the Irish should not intermarry with the Americans of English descent; that the Germans should not marry the Italians; that the Jews should not marry the French.”
Only days after he had calmed the outrage from his statements in Memphis, Eliot was thrust back into public scandal. One paper in the North questioned whether Eliot had “reached the period of senility.” Another suggested that his resignation could not have come soon enough. As with the first incident, the time between the interview and its dissemination was delayed. Once again unaware of the developing controversy, Eliot continued across the South, to Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, and then on a three-day train ride to Atlanta.
After arriving in Atlanta and receiving word about the controversy, Eliot sent a much longer clarifying telegram to Boston. In a Mar. 14 statement, Eliot denied any bigotry toward the Irish in Boston, one group targeted in his statements. “Nobody familiar with the political history of Boston could fail to have deep appreciation of many good influences which Americans of Irish descent have had in our political development,” the telegram read.
In an attempt to show goodwill toward the Irish, Eliot explained that he had authored the inscription for a monument in honor of Patrick Collins, a former Irish mayor of Boston. With regard to the admixture of races, Eliot opted for toning down his language rather than outright recanting. Eliot explained that over time, the mixture of races would blend into one American race. “This blending will be the effect not of rapid amalgamation but of the gradual diminution of differences through the effect of common education and common conditions in national industry and through governmental policies and practices,” he wrote. The pace of this mixture was his chief concern, he said. “That kind of assimilation will preserve the best qualities of all races, some of which might easily be lost by a sudden blend.”
Ironically, on Mar. 13., the day before Eliot sent out the telegram, he spoke at Atlanta University upon the invitation of W.E.B Du Bois. The first African American to receive a doctorate from Harvard, Du Bois served as an esteemed member of the faculty at Atlanta University. The title of Eliot’s speech was “Development of the Negro,” and in his address to students and teachers, Eliot described two attributes of civilized men that were particularly important for that development. The first was “the disposition to go without present gratifications in order to obtain the means of future, more substantial satisfactions.” The second was “the ability to work steadily, day after day, month after month, year after year.”
The irony of Eliot’s presence was not lost on those at Atlanta University. But Edward Ware, the school’s president, took a conciliatory tone, opting to criticize newspapers for what was seen as faulty journalism in publishing “misleading accounts of President Eliot’s allusions to the race problem.” It is difficult to reconcile this apologist stance when, nearly a week later in Asheville, N.C., Eliot was quoted again discussing the negative implications of intermarriage, saying, “the history of civilization shows that wherever the blood is intermingled, the offspring is less strong. There would be fewer weak individuals were there no intermarriages.”
Eliot left Atlanta and continued through South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, before returning to Cambridge. During those seven weeks, Eliot’s comments betrayed a man shaped by the bitter racial tensions of his times. The similarities in the views Eliot expressed to those held by Southerners reveal the racial divides that were endemic to North and South. Ironically, this aligned with the purpose of the trip as explained in the Harvard Bulletin, which stated  that “the sojourn of… President Eliot in the South will do much to make this community of interest begun years ago, closer and definitely lasting.”
While Eliot did gain a new understanding of the South with regard to education and municipal government, the greatest lasting legacy of his trip remains the controversy surrounding views Eliot espoused regarding race in the North. Even as he frantically telegraphed Boston to repair his image, Eliot continued to damage his record with racist missteps. The trip to the South had been a clumsy, downward slide into increasingly unpopular opinions.
If Eliot saw a problem with the mixing of races, he deferred it to future generations. In a letter written on May 5, 1909, directly following his trip to the South, Eliot wrote, “As to the most expedient treatment of colored people who are removed by four or five generations from Africa or slavery, I am in favor of leaving that problem to the people of a hundred years hence.”

Every morning I nearly get run over, or almost don’t hear a friend greet me, or semi-crash into someone because Spotify is blasting in my ears during my walk to class. It’s usually the same few songs (recently it’s been “Hold My Hand” by Jess Glynne or “Choctaw County Affair” by Carrie Underwood). There are thousands of songs available, but for the most part we listen to the same 100 or so songs on that playlist we edit every once in a while (mine is creatively titled “Winter/Spring”).
It’s a weird thing to describe sound, but Ben T. Ratliff of The New York Times has mastered it. The long time pop and jazz critic has written a book called “Every Song Ever: 20 Ways to Listen in an Age of Musical Plenty.” FM had the chance to sit down with him at the Harvard Bookstore on Feb. 16.
Fifteen Minutes: Were you always interested in music? 
Ben Ratliff: I mean, [I didn’t have] a musical family, really, but a family that appreciated music. And I grew up mostly an hour north of New York City… I just came to it through radio and records, really. There wasn't that much musical culture around us where we lived. What I realized when I was about 14 was that I could take a bus into the city and see punk matinee concerts at CBGB’s and be home like, relatively early, and that was the first glimpse probably that I had repeatedly of a musical culture…. College radio was a big thing for me as a teenager and then… being part of a college radio station was really, really important because I was able to do what everybody does, I think, which is you start with what you know and then you work your way backwards to figure out how we came to that point. And I had the big library of records to do that with and I think that’s kind of what all of us have now. That's the amazing thing.
FM: Was there a moment when you thought, ‘Wow this is something that I really like, but I could also do this as a career?’
BR: It was pretty instinctive…. I studied Latin and Greek in college and I really liked to write and I really liked music. It might have been somehow a triangulation of those three things. Sort of like studying, figuring out a language, the mechanics of a language, writing, learning how to describe music. There’s a tradition—this is going to sound really pretentious—but there’s a tradition in Greek literature of describing something, called ekphrasis, e-k-p-h-r-a-s-i-s. It’s a literary device that Homer used where you see the Shield of Achilles or whatever it is and he really goes into deep description of what it looks like and the point is he wants this thing to really rise up in the writing so the essence of it becomes clear. So serious description, and I think I always liked that idea…. I feel like that’s what I’m in this for: to figure out how music works through description and then figure out what else it’s doing.
FM: In terms of discovering music through writing, do you find that challenging? How do you write for the public in that way? 
BR: It’s weird because it’s translating one thing into another. Writing about sound… you're using words to do it. In a way it doesn't make sense, and also there are people who might think, “Why do I need to read? It’s there, I can just press play.” But I don’t really know how to answer that question. I just feel instinctively that there’s a lot of different ways in. Music is really powerful and popular and we all love it. You know the average person spends four hours a day listening to music.... Something amazing like that. So, I guess I just trust that people are going to want to have many different ways to get in there, whatever it takes. If you can accomplish it just by listening, that’s great, but a lot of people like reading about culture, like having ideas to bounce their own off of, and I guess that’s what I’m providing. The thing about like “good” or “bad,” you know, spend your money on it or don’t. I feel less concerned with that. I want to give people a heads up if something is really great or really terrible for sure. I don’t know. But, yeah, it’s not just consumer service. It’s other things; it’s illumination.
FM: So, you do think there’s such a thing as bad music? In the introduction of your book, you talk about Bach versus Beyonce and how, at least to me, it seemed you were saying that music is all very different but can all be equally good. 
BR: Well, I would have to think really hard to think about any music that doesn't potentially have great meaning and that also isn't the result of a whole lot of interesting cultural forces that produced it. Even music that might sound really insipid or silly or whatever. I don’t like everything and I don't think people should like everything. But what's important for me is that people understand the enormity of what they have available to them right now, and that they can find ways to make connections between pieces of music that might not seem to have anything to do with each other. Because the more people can feel like “ok I like this, but that over there is foreign and just doesn’t have anything to do with me.” Well the closer you look at that thing over there it might have something to do with something you know and you start making those connections and then all of a sudden you have a whole lot of, you have new agency. You can claim that thing that thing is about you too. And I just feel like this is, it might be good to develop that ability now before the streaming services really successfully and effectively tell us “now, we know who you are. We really know who you are and we know what kind of music you like. So just don't think about anything else just leave it entirely to us.”
FM: So it’s almost a measure to avoid being overtaken by technology?
BR: Yeah, I mean. I just don’t want it to be, it feels wrong that all that power should be given to algorithms or forces that are there, in a sense are there to reduce you to sell to you better. It makes perfect business sense, but listening is really important. It’s part of how you figure out who you are and how you define your relationship to the world and how you learn emotionally and in every other way. And you can’t, you can’t leave that to an unseen force especially one that isn't necessarily even human.
FM: So in a sense a lot of the listening experience is lost when you give that power to a computer? 
BR: It’s not that...on a song by song basis we’re all fine and.. but it’s the power to connect that can be really individually creative. The power to reach out and connect to another, some other tradition that you don't know much about and figure out what the connection is between what you already know and that.

Earlier this month, President Obama officially visited a mosque for the first time during his tenure. Specifically, he visited my childhood mosque, the Islamic Society of Baltimore. Tucked away on a quiet, tree-lined street, the collection of buildings served as the site of my family's yearly prayer outing on Eid, the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan. On Eid, I’d don a garishly colorful yet elegant shalwar kameez, eat the traditional sweet noodles called seviyan for breakfast, and eagerly await the end of prayers so that I could  ricochet from house to house, collecting presents along the way.
Upon arriving at the ISB, the men and women would shuffle to their separate entrances, guided by their gender. Knowing that I would forget the exact cubby I had placed my shoes, my mom would hide them in a discreet corner rather than leave them in the vast pile that had already formed. As we knelt down on white sheets, I would peek from underneath my headscarf, making sure that I had followed the motions correctly and hoping to survey the motley crew; I was fascinated by women wearing unfamiliar African dashikis. On the car ride home, my mom would inevitably lament what she considered the subpar physical placement of women in the mosque, decrying the arrangement as unequal.
These memories are hard to grasp. As I got older, praying at the mosque on Eid no longer seemed to justify missing a day of school. Last summer, a phone call with my parents sufficed as an Eid celebration as I ate dinner alone in a dorm, having returned from a day's work before my roommates.
I don't pray five times a day. I don't fast during Ramadan. I don't wear a hijab. I definitely don't follow all the "rules" associated with being Muslim. When asked why I don't eat pork, I respond that it's out of habit from growing up in a Muslim family, because I honestly cannot claim this dietary restriction on religious grounds, given the aforementioned "don'ts." In this way, being Muslim does not significantly impact my quotidian routine, and I display no signs of my Muslim background that would be visible to others.
Calling myself a Muslim has always been complicated by the knowledge that I would not be considered one by many who adhere more strictly to Islam, who might see my behaviors as heretic. Still, I’ve been privileged to have a family that emphasizes faith and spirituality over “rules,” and so I have never had to truly worry about my religiosity being deemed insufficient.
That evening, the tears on my cheeks surprised me as I watched a video of President Obama deliver his address. He said, "If you’re ever wondering whether you fit in here, let me say it as clearly as I can, as President of the United States: You fit in here, right here. You’re right where you belong. You’re part of America, too. You’re not Muslim or American. You’re Muslim and American."
How incongruous for someone like me, who did not think she was particularly conflicted about her identity, to blubber and weep solitarily in a Winthrop dorm room, viewing a speech through a screen a few weeks after the fact, simply because I was told that I belonged? That I fit in? That I have a home? While the feeling of wanting to belong might be universal, the complete gratitude that I felt simply for being recognized suggested that I had experienced a discord deeper than I had realized.
If Obama’s words struck such a chord with me, I can only imagine what they must have meant to those who have been targeted, victimized, dehumanized, or otherwise treated like second-class citizens for peacefully practicing their religion. Like all religions, Islam includes a spectrum of followers, and those who practice differently than I do don’t warrant the bigotry and intimidation cast their way. To worshippers in California whose mosque was intentionally set on fire, to the Somali restaurant owner in North Dakota, whose building was defaced with swastikas and the words “go home,” and to the doctor whose brother and sister-in-law were killed in an attack in North Carolina, this proclamation from the highest-elected American must have provided the ultimate validation of their identity. Obama’s words seemed to validate my identity, too.
The speech comes at a time when some presidential candidates seriously campaign on platforms banning all Muslim travel to this country, when many scapegoat Muslims for the perceived ills of America—blinkered rhetoric that equates the appalling, deplorable acts of terrorists with an entire religious group. Such rhetoric suggests fear more than it does anger. Unfortunately, though, a skilled demagogue can easily convert that fear into anger. When the vast majority of Americans cannot name a Muslim friend, fearing Muslims entails fearing the unknown.
My name carries an Islamic legacy, for Prophet Muhammad's mother was named Amna, and Hashmi comes from Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the Prophet’s great-grandfather. I cannot disassociate from my Muslim background, nor do I want to. I’m grateful for the web of Pakistani, Muslim families whose common past engenders uncommon friendships in a newfound homeland. I’m grateful for my khalas, my parents’ friends who are granted the title of aunts and uncles despite not having any blood relation to us. I’m grateful for the moment when all the Eid presents are gathered next to the fireplace, and an aunt calls up a child one at a time to collect her haul. This collection of moments centered on love, humility, generosity, and tradition define being Muslim to me, perhaps more so than when I finished reading the 30 books of the Quran in Arabic or circled the Kaaba in a pilgrimage to Mecca.

“The paradox is you’ve got a billionaire leading a class war in the Republican party.”
E.J. Dionne ’73, a Washington Post columnist, MSNBC contributor, and NPR commentator, recently stopped by The Brattle Theater to talk about his new book, “Why The Right Went Wrong,” in an event hosted by The Harvard Bookstore. But before taking the stage and engaging with the crowd on topics ranging from Winston Churchill to angry internet commenters, Dionne took some time to answer our questions.
Fifteen Minutes: One of the most fascinating ideas in your book is the idea that GOP leaders since 1964 have consistently let their followers down by making promises they couldn’t keep. I’m wondering how you think that trend has been reshaped recently, when, ironically, that radical wing is promising things that are less and less plausible, and yet is garnering even more votes than they have in the past. Why do you think Republican voters are aligning with more radical candidates?
E. J. Dionne: In the case of Trump and immigration, even though some in the party claim to be for immigration reform, they’ve used a rhetoric about the dangers of immigration and the notion that people were pouring across the borders even when immigration from Mexico had fallen below zero. The voters heard that... but they also sensed a lot of their leaders didn’t believe it. So, they decided to vote for the guy who actually seems to believe it, and the very radicalism of what he says—even if it is utterly unrealistic to deport 11 million people and build a wall that [we don’t pay for]—he has a peculiar credibility, because somebody who’s willing to say something that radical must actually believe it. I think that’s sort of what happens with broken promises.
One of my favorite lines about politics is [by] John F. Kennedy. In his inaugural address, he said: “He who foolishly seeks power by riding the back of the tiger ends up inside.” I think that’s what’s happened to a lot of the traditional leaders of the party. I think they were willing to exploit the feelings of rather militant constituencies, like the Tea Party, and thought they could keep them under control. Now, it seems like those militant constituencies are firing back.
FM: You praise Eisenhower in the book for not pretending that he could “roll back the New Deal.” What’s interesting is that Trump is kind of the only Republican in the field who feels the same way about entitlements and other government programs. Do you think that preserving those things, or not trying to have a radical fight with the third rail, is helping Trump out as well, or do you think it’s mostly this radical, on-the-nose rhetoric that is garnering him support?
EJD: Trump is confounding because half of Trump is really reactionary on race and Muslims and immigration, [while] part of Trump is almost “moderate,” which is why he gets votes from “moderates,” because he is willing to acknowledge the importance of social security. He even talks about negotiating the price of prescription drugs under Medicare, which is a democratic idea. I think that speaks straight to his constituency because the Republican Party has relied on white working class votes for decades and has done nothing for them. And that’s a constituency that likes Trump’s social conservatism and hard line on certain questions, but actually is not opposed to social security or medicare or other aspects of government assistance. What struck me about the Trump vote is that his support is pretty constant across ideological categories, but his support is class split. The paradox is you’ve got a billionaire leading a class war in the Republican Party.
FM: A paradox you hit on in the book is that the Republican Party is really working locally—it’s taken over the House and the Senate—but on the national level, they haven’t done as well. Some say this is because they haven’t gone far enough to the right, some say it is because they’ve come to far to the middle, which raises the question: How do you get the Republican Party on a local level to become more moderate and change their beliefs when it’s working so well on the local and statewide level? 
EJD: The problem Republicans face is that what helps them in midterm elections is the very thing that is their long-term problem. The Republican constituency is aging, and the conservative constituency is aging. In 1987, Pew found that only 39 percent of conservatives were over 50; In 2014, 53 percent were. That’s probably higher now. So, they can hang on to power in midterm elections—and Democrats do have to figure out how to turn out voters in midterms—but that very fact says in the long run they’re in big trouble, because the older voters eventually go on to their eternal reward and younger voters are the future. And so, sure Republicans know that yes, this might work in a midterm election or two more, but it doesn’t hold up for the long term.
FM: Going off of that, there’s also the demographic shift—there are a lot more Latino American Voters, African American voters, Asian American voters. Texas might turn blue in the next 10 years. How does the Republican Party account for that and shift its policies towards a more accepting future, when its core base of voters is holding on to this xenophobia in a desperate way? What will incentivize the shift? Losing?
EJD: I think there’s a rule of three in politics. If you look at the '80s, the Democrats lost three presidential elections and made some adjustments under Clinton so they could win. The Tories in Britain lost three elections in a row to Tony Blair, and along comes David Cameron with a project that involves moderation and modernizations. And I think losing a third Presidential election will open more space in the Republican Party. Or, alternatively, if they win, I just don’t think a right wing project is going to win them reelection, because the country is not a right wing country.
FM: You talk about how Charles Krauthammer said: “You can choose your Reagan.” And I think that idea is especially pertinent when you look at this election and see how everybody’s claiming they’re the heir to Ronald Reagan. I know that the whole point of that quote is that there’s no way to pigeonhole Reagan. But who do you think, in spirit or as a politician, most embodies that legacy? 
EJD: I think the first thing to say is that I don’t think Ronald Reagan himself, political realist that he was, would think that the way to win an election in 2016 is to be a guy who was last elected in 1984. In fairness to conservatives, we progressives still hang on to and revere Franklin Roosevelt, and I do too, so I get the reverence. But being exactly Franklin Roosevelt in 2016 wouldn’t work either. Secondly, the whole problem with using Reagan as a model is this ambiguity that Charles and others have talked about. There was a movement Reagan, who was the Reagan who gave the great speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, who right wingers can say [is] the real Reagan. Then there was actually the governing Reagan, who was blessed to have to govern with Democrats and was prepared to govern in a moderate way—who was willing to raise taxes after cutting them when it didn’t work…
In the end, I don’t think any of them is exactly who Reagan was. And maybe because I always thought one of the most important aspects of Reagan was that he was an FDR democrat, and therefore had an instinctive understanding—even though he abandoned liberalism—of FDR kinds of constituencies. And in the party now, there is very little optimism of the Reagan sort, and I think one of the big problems with the modern right is that it is so pessimistic about America as it is now—pessimistic about the values of the country, pessimistic, in some cases, about the ethnic makeup of the country—and Reagan’s optimism was a very important part of his appeal. I like to say that Reagan stole optimism from FDR and Clinton stole it back from Reagan. And Obama has continued that.
FM: Yeah, “Change We Can Believe In.”
EJD: I think the Republicans could use a lot more of what Sarah Palin called, “The Hopey Changey stuff.”

UPDATED: February 25, 2016, at 1:35 p.m.
One week in November, it all converged.
On Wednesday, the rally.  Students donning all black assembled at the Science Center Plaza, performing songs and spoken word in solidarity with college activists agitating for racial equality at Yale and the University of Missouri at Columbia. Harvard President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, both in black coats, blended into the crowd—but the Cambridge Police, with their neon yellow vests, stood out.
The students marched north to Porter Square, flooding Massachusetts Avenue, streetlights silhouetting their fists against the darkening indigo sky. They held hands and shouted and embraced.
“We are here. We are loved,” read one sign.
The next morning, diagonal slashes of matte tape defaced the portraits of black professors in the main corridor of Harvard Law School’s Wasserstein Hall. As the day progressed, black students and professors at the school received an outpouring of support, while some expressed an outrage that would soon culminate in student-led protests demanding racial inclusion at the Law School.
By that afternoon, the tape was gone, and the portraits were framed by colorful Post-its with words of support for the professors. The search for the perpetrator would end, unsuccessfully, less than two months later. Wasserstein Hall had no video cameras.
That same Thursday, a group of students representing the needs of Latino undergraduates—Latinx—met with Faust in her Massachusetts Hall office to discuss the institutional and cultural challenges facing Harvard’s students of color. The Saturday before, a Brown University police officer allegedly assaulted a Dartmouth delegate to the Latinx Ivy League conference after the delegate criticized the rough way the officer was handling a drunk Brown student.
“Structurally, systemically, and institutionally pervasive—our presence within our universities does not make us immune to the contingencies of what it means to be a person of color,” the conference delegates wrote in a jointly signed statement of protest.
That same morning, as if to underscore the students’ declaration, the College’s Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion released a 37-page report advising an array of reforms, from hiring more faculty and staff of color to expanding the number of courses dealing with diversity. The result of months of focus groups, interviews, and research, the report was praised and publicized by both Faust and Khurana. In a University-wide email, Faust called the report “one important foundation on which to build a more truly inclusive community,” also announcing the formation of a University-wide task force to address issues of campus diversity.
“I’m very optimistic. If I wasn’t, I wouldn’t be doing this,” said Jonathan L. Walton, the Pusey minister in Memorial Church and the chair of the working group. The previous year, Walton had spoken at a die-in at the Church after Sunday services, urging protesters to take action against racial inequality.
“As it relates to social change, I tend to put my money on academic institutions being in the forefront so long as they remain intellectually curious communities,” he said in an interview earlier February.
But Thanksgiving came and went, November became December, and as December left so did students, dispersing for winter break. What had briefly seemed like an unsilenceable moment at Yale and Mizzou quieted down. At Harvard, the conversation moved underground—sometimes literally, to the basement offices of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, but also to closed-door meetings and not-yet-defined task forces. The rhetoric and energy built over the month of November gave way to a harsh reality: Here, change doesn’t happen overnight.
“I think the four years I’ve been at Harvard have been a particularly poignant moment for the potential of racial justice transformation on campus,” said Kirin Gupta ’16, an intern at the Harvard Foundation. “But institutional change is really hard, and really expensive.”
At Harvard, a lengthy fight against racial inequality has progressed in uncertain fits and starts, both propelled and stalled by a series of competing forces. A student body diverse in its demands but unequivocal in its passion. An administration attempting to reconcile a cacophony of constituencies, taking gradual and preemptive steps to hold off the wide-scale uprising seen at other schools. In the background of it all, a University: the most exclusive in the world, a product of America’s murky racial past, inching—through no small effort—towards change.
This complicated racial moment finds its roots in Harvard’s founding. History professor Sven Beckert, in 2007, conducted a study on the University’s ties to slavery with his seminar class, discovering that early Harvard presidents often brought their slaves to live with them on campus and a portion of Harvard’s endowment was drawn from exploitation of the slave trade.
Today, Harvard must grapple with this history—reckon with the legacies behind names and symbols—as well as address the new challenges and national movements affecting an increasingly diverse student body.
“I think the Black Lives Matter movement and also the campus unrest that is linked to it are part of this historical moment’s participation in connection to a black freedom struggle that is older than the nation itself,” said Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a lecturer in History and Literature.
What do activists want?  Their demands are nuanced and diverse, including advancements both concrete and cultural. While they may diverge on the particulars, common themes have emerged: Space. Voice. Transparency. Accountability.
Many have asked for a dedicated multicultural center. The letter that the Latinx students issued to Faust, for example, demands “more than sufficient funds to create the ‘Harvard Center for Students of Color’ at a centralized location,” suggesting a floor of the Smith Campus Center be designated for affinity groups and operated by a diverse staff.
A multicultural space at Harvard would find many precedents throughout the Ivy League. Yale, Princeton, and Brown all opened cultural centers in the wake of student activism in the 1960s and ’70s, according to the diversity working group’s 2015 report. At the University of Pennsylvania, students of color find support through both an intercultural center and a network of specialized affinity offices.
“To ask for space—that speaks to a much larger structure of white domination in institutions of higher learning, in our government, our companies, our politics,” Gupta said. “There’s so much embedded marginality. The solutions that students are asking for—they solve big problems.”
According to Khurana, administrators have expressed willingness to look into buying real estate for a multicultural center, but no concrete plans have been announced so far.
In a town hall hosted by the Harvard Foundation last Sunday, Khurana cited space constraints in Harvard Square and the Yard as a limiting factor for a multicultural center. “It’s always a question of who do you displace,” he said, adding that he has worked to make the Quad’s SOCH and other campus spaces easier for student groups to reserve.
The nearest approximation to a multicultural center might be the Harvard Foundation. Established in 1981, the Foundation’s role is largely educational and integrative, centered on sponsoring intercultural programming and distributing grants to affinity groups. Its student advisory committee, comprised of representatives from around 80 campus affinity groups, parcels out its budget to student organizations. It hosts panels and town halls on topics from final clubs to affirmative action. It lauds global humanitarians and hosts the jubilant Cultural Rhythms festival, this year preceded by a week-long “dialogue series” on racial issues. Last semester, the Foundation wrote statements of solidarity with activists at the Law School, after the tape incident, and with student protesters at Yale and Mizzou.
S. Allen Counter, a neurologist at the Harvard Medical School and director of the Foundation, declined to be interviewed for this story, instead directing inquiries to the Foundation’s student interns.
In an emailed statement, Counter wrote that he “has worked very closely with supportive faculty and students for the past thirty years to create an exemplary racial climate at Harvard, and to cultivate an atmosphere of civility, inter-ethnic cooperation, and camaraderie, where ‘race’ will not be a distraction to academic pursuits.” The Foundation has “in large measure, achieved this goal,” Counter wrote, although “challenges remain.”
From its headquarters in the Thayer basement, the Foundation does what it can. But it is, in the end, a small underground office, with interns, including Cengiz Cemaloğlu ’18, suggesting that they would like to see the Foundation expand into a legitimate “hangout space” for students.
“An office with little more than two full-time staff members and a current programming budget of $25,000 was responsible, at least in theory, for all cultural programs, concerns, and educational initiatives of Harvard College’s non-white student population,” reads the report issued by Walton’s working group.
When asked directly, Counter confirmed that the 15 undergraduates who work at the Foundation are also discouraged from taking outright political stances in their work. While many interns participate in activist groups independently, the Foundation itself focuses on what Cemaloğlu called “reactionary” programming, responding to campus issues as they arise.
“We encourage students at the Harvard Foundation to focus on intercultural, interethnic and interreligious matters in programs that engender greater understanding, equity, and inclusion, because that is our mandate,” Counter wrote in an email. “However, we are aware of the intersectionality of ethno-culture and politics, and inevitability of their overlap and integration in our programs.”
The other dedicated bureau for issues of race is the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, established in 2015 and led by Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College’s assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion. Dela Peña declined to respond to specific inquiries and instead emailed a statement in which she called the office’s work a “long-term endeavor.”
According to dela Peña, the office has spent its first year implementing a racial bias reporting system, creating a “cultural competence training program” for staff, providing workshops on microaggressions, and piloting spring break dining. Dela Peña also said the office would soon launch the “Harvard College Intergroup Dialogue Program,” aimed at bringing together groups of undergraduates to discuss topics including race and socioeconomic status.
Yet the office is still young, and, according to the Walton report, undersized for its duties. “Though having the support of the Office of Student Life, this assistant dean has oversight of two centers (Women’s Center and Office of BGLTQ Student Life) that appear to be larger than the actual office of the assistant dean in terms of staff and resources,” the report reads. Dela Peña assisted in the preparation of the report.
In many ways, the college campus is an ideal incubator for effective change, populated by intellectually energetic students capable of organizing a protest with a single email to a House list. But student activism is also a fight against time: With organizers graduating and new, uninitiated classes arriving, it can be difficult to sustain a movement in the long-term—and it can be difficult for the University to meet constantly changing demands.
“I think the University benefits from a severe lack of institutional memory amongst the student body,” said Jaime A. Cobham ’17, a Crimson editorial writer and political action chair of the Black Students Association. “We’re dealing with four-year windows.”
Another near-unanimous demand is the increased hiring of non-white faculty, suggested by the Walton report, the Latinx students, and many other activists. While FAS has instituted a hiring policy aimed at recruiting more professors of color, the Faculty still lags behind a diversifying student body.
According to the 2015 FAS annual report, “minorities” (a category including black, Latino, Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and multiracial professors) now comprise 21 percent of Harvard’s faculty—a small improvement over 2014’s 19 percent. Fewer still are female professors of color.
By contrast, 42 percent of the Class of 2019 does not identify as white.
Faculty of color are frequently called upon to advise students in both formal and informal capacities, said Brandon M. Terry ’05, a co-author of the diversity report and an assistant professor of African and African American Studies and Social Studies. Speaking at a Harvard Foundation panel on ethnic studies, Terry recalled filling out an end-of-year faculty activity report and struggling to describe his many non-academic commitments.
“I mentioned all the groups I’ve spoken at—I’ve spoken at every African American and African group on campus in the first five months—but there’s no way to really convey that that involves labor on a form. It’s just a dash,” he said. “There’s no, ‘I talked with them, we hung out for four hours after that and they explained to me all the stuff they’re going through.’”
Outside of the classroom, some students are calling on Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services to hire more clinicians of color, citing the disproportionate incidence of mental health issues among underrepresented groups. Recently, Indigo—a new peer counseling group focused on the intersection of race, class, and mental health and advised by HUHS mental health counselors—opened in the basement of Adams House. 
Walton also said Houses can vary in the diversity of their tutors, drawn from a pool of graduate students  which can be as racially skewed as the faculty.
“People are treated differently in different houses,” Walton said. “Students felt that if the point of randomizing the house system is to make sure that people from all different walks of life come into contact with each other, why do some feel like they’re being put into staid house cultures?”
Adams House co-Master Judith S. Palfrey ’67 agreed, adding that discrepancies between Houses become especially apparent when it comes to tutor hiring. In Dunster House, for example, a Crimson story cited in the Walton report found a lack of in-House staff and support for BGLTQ students.
Demand for curricular change, too, has been ongoing but slow moving.
Many students have asked for a diversity studies requirement in the undergraduate curriculum. As the program on General Education undergoes a makeover in coming months, students are pushing for required courses in gender and ethnicity.
Still, it is likely that a Gen Ed overhaul, let alone one that meets students’ wishes, will take some time. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has said that implementing a renewed Gen Ed program at the beginning of the 2016-2017 academic year would be “extremely difficult,” although a review committee was originally convened in early 2014. As of the latest report, required courses on gender and ethnicity are not included in the provisional program, although some courses under this umbrella are offered through Gen Ed. It is unlikely that a diversity requirement will appear in the new program, though: Gen Ed review committee chair and Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly warned against creating narrow Gen Ed categories at a FAS meeting in December.
At the Foundation’s panel on ethnic studies, Mayra Rivera Rivera—a Divinity School professor who works on the Ethnicity, Migration, Rights Committee—said the Committee will conduct a seminar to consider designing a required Gen Ed course on the construction and manifestations of ethnicity that would be an option, not a requirement, for undergraduates.
Harvard has publicly touted its ethnically and globally diverse student body, Diana K. Nguyen ’15, a former EMR student coordinator with a secondary in the program, said. Nguyen said she believes, however, that Harvard contradicts itself by not offering an equally diverse curriculum.
“Does that mean that the diversity of students is important, but the diversity of academics isn’t?” she asked, speaking at the same Harvard Foundation panel. “I find it very difficult to say that just having diverse students, but not providing those diverse students with diverse classes, shows that you value diversity.”
While Harvard’s African and African American Studies department hasachieved national renown after decades of development, for Latino, Asian American, Native American, and Pacific Islander students especially, creating departments and degree programs for their respective cultural groups has been an uphill battle. Currently, students can concentrate in History and Literature with a focus on Latin America, or specialize in Latino studies only through a secondary concentration offered through Harvard’s Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights. The Committee founded a working group last year to explore a similar program for Asian American studies. A Native American studies department still remains on the table.
Because EMR is a committee with small footholds in many established departments, though, the program faces difficulties in bringing its affiliates together to advocate for its growth. Nguyen says the underdevelopment of Harvard’s ethnic studies programs is “a chicken and egg problem.” Because the EMR Committee is underresourced, it struggles to accurately gauge student interest and make a case for expansion.
Others ask that briefings on race and diversity occur from the very beginning of a Harvard education, through more in-depth conversations on issues of race and diversity during Opening Days, an orientation period for freshmen. Currently, freshmen are asked to read and discuss a text on identity for 90 minutes during Opening Days, with a stated goal of learning “about your peers’ diverse identities and perspectives.”
“We’re not asking people to dig deep,” said Kia C. Turner ’16. “At the end of the day, I think that’s crazy because the people who are feeling uncomfortable on this campus feel it all four years, and we can’t ask people to feel uncomfortable for more than an hour and a half?”
The current movement for racial inclusivity on campus is multifaceted and Faust—typically removed from the nuances of undergraduate life—has increasingly become involved. After the release of the College-centered Walton report, Faust announced she would heed the report’s call to form an unprecedented University-wide task force studying issues of diversity. In early February, Faust said she was still working to define the mission and identify members of the task force, but said it would likely be modeled on the existing sexual assault task force. 
As the University’s chief administrator, Faust is primarily tasked with running the Harvard Corporation and conducting fundraising campaigns. Yet in the past few years, and especially in recent months, Faust and other administrators have hosted both small gatherings and town halls to discuss racial grievances and possible remedies.
In 2014, Faust met with some participants of of “I, Too, Am Harvard,” a powerful multimedia campaign started by Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16 that received national attention and sparked a campus-wide conversation about racial inclusion at Harvard. That meeting, according to Faust, provided the impetus for the Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion’s report, released the next year.
After the Brown campus police brutality incident at the Latinx Ivy League Conference in 2015, Faust invited around a dozen Latinx students to her Massachusetts Hall office to discuss a wide-ranging list of demands, including a multicultural space and more ethnic studies offerings.
Another clause invited Faust to a February Latinx town hall hosted by Concilio Latino, an umbrella group for the College’s many Latinx student organizations. Though Faust, scheduled during that time for a dinner with the Harvard Alumni Association’s Board of Elected Directors, did not attend, Khurana and interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman  ’67 did. Several activists interviewed, including Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17, co-chair of Concilio Latino, characterized Khurana as a sympathetic supporter within the administration.
“The one thing I’ve been pleasantly surprised to find is that administrators have been receptive to listening to Latinx leaders on campus,” said Ruben Reyes ’19, a Latinx conference delegate. “A part of me thinks that this is a result of them wanting to prevent an escalation of events on campus, but a larger side of me does believe they want to listen to our concerns.” Like all students interviewed for this story, Reyes emphasized that he was only expressing his own views, and not speaking for all Latinx students.
Later that semester, Khurana and Faust convened a gathering of what Faust estimated to be 20 to 25 campus affinity group leaders at Phillips Brooks House in response to the Walton report. According to David O. Daniel ’17, president of the Black Men’s Forum, the attendees discussed the slow progress of initiatives including expanding ethnic studies and founding a multicultural center.
“I’m really grateful to all the student leaders who have been so forthcoming and engaged and had such terrific ideas about how to solve a set of problems that matter so much to all of us,” Faust said after the meeting. “I hope we can keep making progress, and have enough progress and enough sense of trust that we’re going to continue to make progress, so that we don’t have to resort to the kind of disruptions that we’ve seen elsewhere.”
Perhaps the most immediate change to come from these discussions, though, was buried in a subpoint —section III, article V— of the Latinx students’ three-page missive where they requested the elimination of the Harvard’s historic House master title.
Introduced with Harvard’s transition to the House system in the 30’s, the “House master” title—derived from the Latin magister and rooted in the traditions of the medieval European universities—is one of many lingering emblems of Harvard’s 380-year past. While most Harvardisms (“concentrations” for majors, “Houses” for dorms) seem innocuous, this one engendered controversy.
In December, Khurana informed the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that the masters of the College’s undergraduate Houses had decided to change their title because of its perceived associations with slavery. Khurana, a House master himself, said in December that the title made him personally uncomfortable. Shortly thereafter, he announced that all 24 masters chose unanimously to search for a less controversial replacement. Smith wrote in an email to undergraduates and FAS members Wednesday that the new title would be “Faculty Dean.”
Still, the ensuing uproar—a chorus of praise and criticism, fueled by breathless national media coverage—exemplifies the struggle of enacting even a relatively minor, nominal change at Harvard.
Soon, the backlash began. Critics of the change—including The Crimson’s Editorial Board, in an article entitled “No Masterstroke”—charged Harvard with ignoring the title’s more innocuous etymology.
“I think that the decision unfortunately reflects a misunderstanding and perhaps ignorance of the origins of the term,” said Peter L. Malkin ’55, a philanthropist and namesake of the Malkin Athletic Center. “I think it has to be or should be a very serious reason, a very material reason for making any change.”
But “words are powerful,” Khurana said, defending the change. “We try to do as much as we can in the short term.” Palfrey, the Adams House co-Master, added that she sees the change as a signal of solidarity with Harvard’s undergraduate students of color, adding that, for many, the term was “painful” regardless of its actual origins.
When Smith announced the change on Wednesday, he acknowledged that “titles send a message.” Still, he wrote in his email, the House Master title “ is and will remain a part of the College’s long and proud history” and is not necessarily directly related to slavery.
Within Harvard, some continue to question the politics of the decision. One of the most dangerous trends in academia, said Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, is the tendency to “placate students instead of educate them.” In January, Mansfield wrote The Crimson a flippant letter to the editor mocking the move.
“This was a reprehensible change, I think, without any sufficient reason,” he said. “It’s out of nowhere—out of discomfort of those masters who look to make that kind of association.”
Before long, Faust—herself a Civil War historian—was called to weigh in. While Faust was not involved with the initial decision, she said she supported the move and that questions about the title had “been in the air for a long time, probably a decade or so at least.”
The debate, said Faust, “has focused on gender and female House masters feeling a little strange about this very gendered title. And so there’s been kind of continuing discussion and the issues of—does it mean mastery over people, in ways that are not consistent with how we understand those communities? And then, most explicitly, recently the racial overtones of the word master.”
Reyes disagreed with Mansfield. “Many administrators and students of color alike have felt uncomfortable about the title, so there is definitely a chunk of the student body that will embrace the title change as a step forward,” he said. “I personally don’t think it’s a change made simply to placate students.”
A few weeks after Khurana announced the House master title would change, the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion launched a similarly intended but controversial initiative. In a number of dining halls, the Office installed “Holiday Placemats for Social Justice,” laminated guides with tips for discussing topics like student activism at Yale and the Syrian refugee crisis with families over winter break. The placemat guide proposed hypothetical statements on each topic and offered a possible response to each: In the House master section, for example, the question “Why did they change the name? What does a housemaster have to do with slavery?” suggested the answer, “Given the name is offensive to groups of people, it doesn’t seem onerous to change it.”
While both the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and the Freshman Dean’s Office initially endorsed the placemats as a piece of “passive programming” intended to help students navigate difficult topics, backlash from students and attention from national media outlets eventually forced a retreat. Within a few days, the Harvard Republican Club had created a series of parody posters criticizing the placemats’ one-sided presentation of the issues and “strawman arguments.”
Gwen R. Thomas ’17, current president of the Republican Club, said that while she does not oppose racial justice, she was troubled that an official Harvard office would distribute what she called a “condescending” and one-sided document.
“We as a club were thinking that this really leaves out a large group of students, including others who might disagree with not even all, but some of the points of the placemat,” she said. “It’s really being exclusive to anyone who wants to talk about these things. There was definitely a thought of, ‘This could just be the beginning.’”
Crimson editorial executive Idrees M. Kahloon ’16 appeared on Don Lemon’s CNN program condemning the placemats as emblematic of a broader movement to stifle free speech on campus.
“I think you have students who are saying that they are very uncomfortable with opposing views and that they want the university to step in place and to basically protect them,” Kahloon said. “There is this new conjured-up right that you have the right to not be offended and you have the right to not be uncomfortable.”
Within a week, Dingman and then-Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde sent a College-wide email apologizing for the placemats, acknowledging that they “failed to account for the many viewpoints that exist on our campus.” Faust agreed in an interview that the placemats were “a really bad idea.”
When asked about their priorities, few activists would put the House master title change or the placemats at the top, although many agree that symbolic changes are small but necessary steps in forging significant institutional advancement. Still, as the House masters deliberate on a new title into the spring and the placemat debacle fades, some students say they believe deeper systemic issues of race and inclusivity at Harvard have gone largely unnoticed.
“It’s a good thing that [the name] changed because I would feel uncomfortable living under a ‘master,’ but that’s not changing the nuts and bolts of this university,” Cobham said.
“If we’re talking about what students of color are actually asking for at the heart of these conversations, they’re not small asks,” agreed Gupta, the Foundation intern. “What people are responding to are the small concessions that the administration are giving. What students want is much bigger than what Harvard is currently responding to.”
These small concessions, said Mansfield, “seem to be a kind of preemptive surrender” on the part of the administration.
But if a multicultural center, a more diverse faculty, and a broader ethnic studies curriculum aren’t immediately actionable, the title change—and the social justice placemats, and the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion—are at least small indications that Harvard’s administration is trying to stay on the activists’ side.
Last semester in New Haven, a sizable group of students visibly and vocally turned on Yale administrators  after Silliman College associate master Erika L. Christakis, a former Pforzheimer House master, sent an email defending students’ rights to wear Halloween costumes that some construed as offensive or culturally appropriative. That email, coupled with allegations that a Yale fraternity held a “white girls only” party, touched off a wave of protests at Yale with reverberations throughout the country.
While many Harvard students have expressed solidarity with their peers at Yale, demonstrations in Cambridge have been more subdued. Demands are largely expressed through smaller town halls and meetings, not college-wide rallies.
Behind all the rivalry, Yale and Harvard are two incredibly similar universities—so similar, in fact, that some have wondered: Why not here?
Aaron I. Henricks ’16, former president of the Harvard Republican Club, said he believes the administration has used fast-tracked initiatives like the House master name change and the placemats to stave off more visible protests. “I think the University responded so quickly to avoid becoming Yale or Mizzou,” Henricks said. “At Mizzou, applications are down and PR is down the toilet. But has Harvard actually helped the school? I don’t know.”
Cobham, along with several other students, said Christakis’s email ignited a campuswide discussion and movement around racial issues in a way not yet seen at Harvard.
“They had a very high profile single issue, which then also creates a huge amount of pressure. Those things become very public and very salient for a lot of people not just on those campuses but around the country, so change is going to come,” Cobham said. “For us, I think the administration does a very good job—or a much better job—of being proactive and reaching out to students.”
Faust, though, isn’t counting her chickens. “Part of it is circumstance, part of it is just some incident throws a lighted match into a barn full of hay, and I feel that the interactions that I’ve had with undergraduates and that I’ve seen generally have been really constructive and positive and based in excellent exchange that I think can move us forward in important ways and are very effective interactions,” she said. “So I’m really pleased about that. But I can’t guarantee that something might not set it off in a different direction.”
Many students interviewed agreed that widely publicized police brutality incidents against people of color have noticeably catalyzed and energized both campus activists and their opponents over the past year.

At Harvard Law School, perhaps the present epicenter of racial activism across Harvard’s schools, discussions on racial inclusivity have accelerated over the past year and garnered national attention. What began as students’ discomfort over the Law School’s seal—which features the family crest of Isaac Royall Jr., a slaveholder who financed the establishment of the Law School—culminated in a list of demands to the school’s dean Martha L. Minow in December. The demands, issued by a group now called Reclaim Harvard Law School, asked for substantive changes to both curriculum and culture at HLS.

Reclaim Harvard Law School’s petition asks Minow to acknowledge the school’s controversial history, including a removal of the Royall family crest on the school’s seal. Curricularly, it demands both the creation of a critical race theory program and that professors undergo cultural sensitivity trainings. In mid-February, Law School activists took up residence in a major campus thoroughfare, calling the lounge “Belinda Hall” after one of Royall’s slaves.
“Having to deal with that shield every day, to be under a thing that fundamentally devalues, is undignified in a very visceral sense that a lot of white students probably can’t understand,” said Alexander J. Clayborne, a third-year Law student who helps organize campus activist efforts. “It’s that contradiction between an institution that says it’s all about diversity and inclusion, saying, ‘come into the doors of HLS, everybody,’ but then you have this symbol up here. You’re not fulfilling what you say you’re going to do.”
Claybourne is frustrated with what he says is a lack of institutional action on the group’s demands, and says numerous administrators, professors, and Harvard Corporation members—who have the final say behind the seal’s change— have been happy to talk but reluctant to commit to real action. 
Dean Minow has created a committee to reconsider the seal, and wrote in an email to Law School affiliates that she would be thinking about the proposals.
“I listened carefully,” Minow wrote. “I will do my best to ensure that we find ways to work together, joining students, staff, and faculty to address proposals and above all to strengthen this School and its possibilities to be better and to make the world better.”
Over in Longwood, a group of Harvard Medical and Dental School students are also petitioning the University to diversify the faculty and student body as the Medical School searches for a new dean.
In early February, 40 members of a group called the “Racial Justice Coalition,” donning lab coats, entered Massachusetts Hall to deliver the petition to Faust, though she was not in the building to receive it.
Just last week, epidemiologist Michelle A. Williams was named the next dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. She will be the first black person to lead a faculty in Harvard’s history.
At the College, the launch of Renegade, an arts and advocacy magazine by and for Harvard students of color, was marked by controversy. As members distributed posters around the Houses that publicized the magazine, others mocked the posters with antagonistic slogans. “Because Mather owned slaves,” read one Renegade poster. “Because all white men are racist,” a parody read.
According to Gupta, who has been involved in Renegade since its inception, the publication seeks to empower students of color through visual art, music, and the written word.
“It’s a manifold project: community building, political action, making an expression of trauma in the POC experience from the small to large scale,” she said. “That’s what Renegade is trying to do—to find that connective tissue and use art and music and writing, to show with artistic production what is in common, what is created by a structure of domination.”
Nearly a year later, Renegade hasn’t stopped creating. In November, just before the week of tumult, they published an issue full of “love letters” for POC activists on campuses across the country. This semester, Jenny A. Gathright ’16, a former Crimson editorial writer and a founder of Renegade, launched “Black Magic,” a play at Loeb theater featuring an entirely black cast.
“It seems like there are these very occasional moments when you see people realizing that these issues that they face in their own communities are issues that are actually shared. I think those are all too rare moments in Harvard’s history,” said Moses Kim ’18, a Renegade contributor. “The entire premise of Renegade was that this was a space for people of color to come together and draw on each other’s powers.”
There’s a deeper concern behind the phenomenon of Renegade that administrators have been reluctant to address: What if diversity isn’t enough?
“Diversity” is the buzzword of task forces and offices, and a major selling point of the undergraduate experience. Often, it’s accompanied by “inclusion,” and together they paint a hopeful, pluralist picture worthy of a Harvard brochure.
In November, Harvard filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court affirmative action case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin declaring its commitment to a diverse student body; Faust has publicly pledged her dedication to the use of affirmative action in Harvard’s admissions processes. Diversity, said Faust said earlier this month, is “just inseparable from excellence,” adding that Harvard is the most diverse place that many of its students have lived or will ever live.
But perhaps one of Renegade’s most radical acts, and a reason why the magazine inspired such virulent criticism in its nascent days, is that it has dared to make a case for exclusivity—for a space apart from white people.
Kim, a poet, has spent a lot of time thinking about who is listened to at Harvard and who isn’t.
“I think too often diversity is thrown out there as this neutering force,” Kim said. “Diversity is throwing people into a room and presuming that every voice will have equal space.”
Separate cultural spaces should have a legitimate place in campus life, McCarthy agreed.  “The anxiety over those culturally specific spaces says more about the people who are anxious about them than those who are calling for them,” he said, recalling how he wouldn’t think of accompanying his black roommates to the Black Students Association’s meetings as an undergraduate. “Sometimes queer people don’t want to be around straight folks, sometimes women don’t want to be around men, sometimes people of color don’t want to be around white people. There’s nothing wrong with that.”
But equally, if not more necessary, agreed Faust, Walton, and McCarthy, are spaces for what Faust called “bridging and belonging”—reaching out to those unlike themselves to overcome cultural divides.
“It doesn’t mean that everybody has to have every moment of their life in interaction with every other kind of person who’s at Harvard, but it does mean we don’t want to have circumstances where people are isolated or separated from one another, but rather experiences that give them strength for bridging out to others,” Faust said. She’s trying to find the balance between resilience and safety, she said, and worries that separatism could “incapacitate” students after they graduate.
Cary A. Williams ’16, former president of the Association of Black Harvard Women, said she understands being at Harvard entails engaging with people of different backgrounds and praises the randomized housing system for institutionalizing diversity.
Still, she said, “I do believe that folks of different identities do need a space where they feel like they can go home to breathe if they think that they need that. I don’t think it’s anything about backing down from a challenge or not wanting to engage: we do the work of engaging every day, just like all students.”
Walton, the chair of the diversity task force, questioned the rhetoric of inclusion—he said it implied a Harvard that is “finished and complete,” slotting students into a static structure—but argued that the “beauty of Harvard is that it’s the sum of all of its diverse parts.” He is sympathetic to Kim’s concerns of erasure, he said, but believes that separate spaces for identity groups can and should cut across racial lines.
“We were really committed to identifying places of exclusion and finding ways that we can make cultures of belonging,” Walton said. “If you are an African American Jewish lesbian from Senegal, heck, there are spaces on this campus and this campus as a whole where you can feel comfortable being all of your multiple beautiful parts.”
Kim says he knows that a Harvard built on separation would fall apart, but believes that a broader cultural shift—diversity with an emphasis on listening to the less privileged—would go a long way towards remedying what he half-jokingly called the “section kid meme.”
“[I want to] reconcile the very real and very legitimate pain that people feel on this campus, and work towards an understanding for people who haven’t had those experiences,” he said. “A reason a lot of us are here is because we’re able to speak over a lot of people. Structurally and pedagogically, there’s not a weight being put on how to listen.”
Diversity and inclusion seem to be aspects of a Harvard education that its leadership holds dear. From sitting down with affinity groups to forming task forces, working groups, and new offices, many administrators are trying their hands at making students’ experiences—regardless of race, ethnicity, or background—of equal quality. But in speaking to activists and allies, one thing is clear: changes that Harvard’s students of color want reach far beyond changing titles and etching buildings’ names out of stone.
“Institutions have built into them a certain kind of inertia, a bureaucracy that resists social change,” McCarthy said. “That’s why you need campus activists to rise up and demand the things they do.”
It’s February now, and the Yard where protesters  have marched and stood and lain for years is without grass. Flock of tourists shuffle by the statue and snap a few photos of “John Harvard.” Rubs the dull gold foot. The bronze-cast man in their photos isn’t really John Harvard, as anyone who’s passed within 20  feet of a “Hahvahd” tour guide could tell you. He’s a student, his likeness immortalized for its apparent similarity to those of “the early comers to our shores.”
He doesn’t look like Harvard: not the man, and certainly not the University today in all of its messy and vital multiplicity. Sitting sentry for over a century, he’s seen his share of setbacks and injustices. But also: a transformation, hard-fought, that looks—from the distant vantage of history—something like progress.
“We won’t see immediate change in this place, because that’s not something that Harvard does,” Cobham said. “It’s been here long before us and will be here long after we’re dead.”
That doesn’t mean that he’s giving up, though. Nor is Walton, sounding spirited on a Friday afternoon over the phone.
“I don’t like to use the word ‘optimistic’—there’s a certain inevitability to optimism that I think belies how social change happens, because there’s a level of commitment and determination that’s needed,” Walton said.
“Maybe I’ll put it—I’m hopeful. I have hope.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 24, 2016, at 11:50 p.m.
Each of Harvard’s 24 House masters will now be called a “Faculty Dean,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in an email to undergraduates and FAS members early Wednesday evening.
 In his email, Smith unveiled the new name and acknowledged ongoing critiques of the changes, which Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in early December after House leaders unanimously agreed to change their title. Some noted that the term “master” could be associated with slavery.
Khurana said there would be a name change sometime in “early” 2016; the title itself comes more than two months after he first announced a change.
In the months following Khurana’s announcement, some opponents argued that the change was misinformed, since the linguistic origins of the word “master” do not relate directly to slavery.
“Some have called it a ‘mistake’ believing that we didn’t understand the root of the word ‘master,’ or that we lacked a proper appreciation for the history of the title at Harvard and the European institutions from which Harvard leaders took inspiration, or that we were acting too quickly and without thought to student demands,” Smith wrote. “None of these could be farther from the truth.”
Smith also wrote that the new name does not directly respond to those critiques.
“I want to emphasize that a decision to change does not necessarily mean that what came before was wrong,” Smith wrote. “I have not been shown any direct connection between the term House Master and the institution of slavery.”
However, he wrote that “titles send a message” and they can and should change when such a change serves the College’s mission.
Still, he wrote that many alumni will likely still use the term House master “and they should have no qualms in doing so. The term House Master is and will remain a part of the College’s long and proud history.”
Last semester, Khurana, a Cabot House Faculty Dean, said he had “not felt comfortable personally with the title” of House master. At the December Faculty meeting, he said the recommendation to change the title was “rooted in a broad effort to ensure that the College’s rhetoric, expectations, and practices around our historically unique roles reflects and serves the 21st century needs of residential student life.”
Mather House Faculty Dean Michael D. Rosengarten said he thought the former House master title was “offensive and inappropriate” to students. Still, he said, the new title is not perfect.
“We have a lot of deans now at Harvard,” Rosengarten said, adding that students could be confused by the word “faculty” in the title because not all Faculty Deans are Harvard professors. Additionally, all Houses have separate resident deans who are also members of FAS.
In his email, Smith wrote that new dean title would reflect both Faculty Deans’ high academic and administrative positions, and that the term could be more easily recognizable to individuals outside of Harvard.
Ultimately, the Faculty Deans provided a list of potential titles to Smith, who made the final decision on the name.
Leverett Faculty Dean Howard Georgi wrote in a House-wide email that he “guessed all along that [the change] might go this way, not because the term is perfect, but because all of the alternatives were less appropriate.”
Smith closed his email by emphasizing that the title change would not signal an end to University-wide discussions about race, which recently have dominated campus and national discourse.
William A. Greenlaw ’17, a Pforzheimer House Undergraduate Council representative, said he appreciated that administrators changed the title but still had lingering concerns.
“I think it’s a good title, my only worry is that the College might pat itself on the back for doing the name change and then forget about issues of greater cultural import on campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid ongoing discussions about sexual assault and consent on campus, the new General Education course Ethical Reasoning 42: “Sexual Ethics as Ethical Reasoning” asks students to challenge their preconceived notions about sex and morality.
The new offering comes on the heels of a recent sexual assault climate survey, which found that more than 30 percent of surveyed undergraduate senior women had experienced some form of sexual assault while at Harvard. Because of those findings, some of the course’s 125 students said they find the course deeply relevant.
“The class really makes you question your own sexual ethics, which is really important,” Gabriella A. Germanos ’18 said. “Sexual ethics related to consent and sexual violence is something people are talking about a lot right now, so I think it’s a particularly salient class.”
Mark D. Jordan, a women and gender studies professor, teaches the course. He is also a member of a University-wide task force assigned to review Harvard’s Title IX policies, which were introduced in 2014.  According to Jordan, the course is designed to help students look critically at commonly held beliefs about sexual ethics.
“Ethics isn’t neutral information. Ethics is active formation,” Jordan wrote in an email. “So an essential part of teaching sexual ethics is getting people to reflect honestly both on what they believe and on how they have been led to those beliefs.”
In the course, students read a variety of texts to understand the antecedents of current thought and the differences in sexual norms that have existed across cultures and times. For students like Julia B. Wiener ’19, this study of older ethical texts is meaningful.
“A lot of the things that we take for granted are coming from these really old ideas,” Wiener said. “We can think that they’re really logical and someone decided them a while ago, but it’s important to rethink it.”
For Kira C. Telgen ’19, a student in the class, the course offers an opportunity to look at sexual ethics from new perspectives.
“I guess because I’m from a conservative town and I’ve been raised in a very Christian background, I’ve been raised with an idea of what my sexual ethics should be,” Telgen said. “I don’t necessarily want to challenge that, but I want to reflect on what my values are.”
Such self-reflection, along with discussion of topics like sexual assault, can sometimes be difficult for students, Jordan wrote. As a result, the course heads took steps, including talking with Title IX representatives, to ensure students are aware of the resources available to them.
“You can’t teach sexual ethics—or any kind of ethics—by avoiding painful questions on which there is strong disagreement,” Jordan wrote. “At the same time, you never want to teach ethics unethically, in ways that harm members of the class or manipulate them or treat them disrespectfully.”
For Telgen, some discomfort is a necessary part of the course.
“It’s supposed to make you uncomfortable,” Telgen said. “It’s supposed to put you out of your comfort zone, to challenge you to think about what your own ethics are and the ethics of the society.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With increasing rates of fatal heroin and opioid-related overdoses in Cambridge, City Councillors are discussing policies that may help alleviate the growing epidemic, including expanding funding for treatments and supporting statewide legislation.
Cambridge has seen an increase in the number of opioid overdoses in the past three years, according to a Massachusetts Department of Public Health study. A Cambridge Public Health Department study revealed that fatal opioid-related overdoses rates for the city were 7.3 cases per 100,000 people, which is lower than the state average of 10.7 cases.
State-wide information also points to an increasing trend in Massachusetts. According to a recent report from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, heroin overdose rates have skyrocketed since 2000, climbing from 338 deaths to 1,173 deaths in 2014, a 247 percent increase. Data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse show similar national trends.
The magnitude of the issue has made it difficult for Cambridge City Councillors to prevent heroin overdoses at a municipal level.
“It's a regional and national and international issue if you’re talking about stopping the drug trade,” said City Councillor Jan Devereux. “It’s got both physical and psychological roots.”
The City Council has passed resolutions focused on prevention and treatment, held a roundtable meeting, and supported state legislation in recent months. One resolution passed in August emphasizes the gravity of the epidemic and the Council’s reaction to Cambridge's heroin crisis.
“This is [the] biggest public health epidemic that our state and region is faced with right now,” the August resolution reads. “Our city is not immune to this epidemic; and given the risks for public safety, our City must address this issue aggressively.”
Devereux said prevention and treatments can include programs in education and substance abuse clinics. However, Cambridge and other neighboring areas are in significant need of more funding, she said.
“Obviously it’s a really multi-pronged approach,” Devereux said. “We don’t have enough treatment beds in Cambridge, Boston and the state. Unless we're ready to fund more of that—because it’s expensive and it’s uninsured.”
According to the Cambridge Public Health Department study, 272 people per 100,000 were admitted to state-funded treatment programs for heroin. The state rate was considerably higher: 790.7 people per 100,000.
Other  methods of combating the epidemic are beyond municipal control. The Council  passed a resolution on February 1 supporting two bills currently progressing through the Massachusetts state legislature that would allow local police to administer Narcan, a drug that helps treat individuals who have overdosed.
“Cambridge Police, who are often first on the scene of overdose situations, have expressed an interest in carrying Narcan, but have concerns regarding legal civil liability associated with administering the drug,” the resolution reads.
Ultimately, the issue is one that must start with prevention, Devereux said.
“Having Narcan available is so important because it can save lives but it doesn’t solve the problem,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allstonians and Boston officials will face competing pressures for housing and open space over the next few months as they debate the future of a Harvard-owned land parcel commonly known as Brookline Machine Site.
Harvard announced its decision to donate the site, located on Antwerp Street in Brighton, to the City of Boston in November 2013 as part of its community benefits package for Allston and Brighton. Nearly a year ago, Harvard signed a contract with the Boston Redevelopment Authority, Boston’s urban planning agency, to make the land available for a use of the agency’s choosing.
The agreement stipulated that the BRA engage in a “community process,” consulting task force members, neighborhood representatives, and residents living nearby to determine the future of the 29,700-square foot land parcel.
“We look forward to hearing the outcome of those conversations, and to the eventual transfer of the property so that the entire community can enjoy the benefits,” Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement.
The contract further specified that this “determination period” should end no later than Sept. 26, 2016—roughly seven months from now.
“We need to come up with something [because] we have a limited amount of time,” said John A. Bruno, interim chair of the Harvard-Allston task force. “Harvard owns it until we come up with plan, so we need to come up with a plan.”
Gerald Autler, the BRA’s senior project manager, agreed. Autler said he held a task force meeting last May to discuss the future of the Brookline Machine Site, but the conversation “didn’t yield the results” he was hoping for. He added that he intends to use a portion of the next few task force meetings to determine the best use for the land parcel.
“I would hope that we can do it in a short series of meetings,” Autler said. “There’s not an endless universe of possible uses there.”
Allston residents and task force members have so far suggested two potential options for the lot, proposing that it contain either new housing or parks and open space.
Those who advocate for the construction of housing units emphasize the need for more market-rate homes in Allston and Brighton, citing concerns over rising prices in the area.
“I think it will bring great opportunities for younger families or younger professionals, people who want to raise their families or start a family in a nice neighborhood,” Jim Montgomery, task force member and proponent of the housing option, said. “This is a great place to raise a family.”
Supporters of the open space proposal argue that, with the recent completion of apartment buildings like Continuum, a retail and residential complex located on Harvard-owned land in Allston, the neighborhood is becoming too densely populated.
“People need a good quality of life, people need to breathe, people need to have a place to go to relax,” said Tim McHale, task force member and advocate for open space. “It’s getting kind of cramped.”
Neither Montgomery nor McHale expressed much enthusiasm for a proposal, mentioned by Autler, that Brookline Machine Site hold some combination of housing and open space.
Both, however, expressed certainty that their respective proposals are backed by a majority of Allston residents, leaving Bruno, the task force chair, with a potentially delicate balancing act to perform in coming task force meetings.
“If you have open space you’re not creating stabilizing housing, if you’re stabilizing housing then you’re neglecting an opportunity to create open space,” Bruno said. “So now you’re caught in the middle.”
He could have been describing himself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the History Department remain divided over the absence of a “Study of the Past” requirement in the General Education Review Committee’s final report released in January.
History professor and member of the General Education review committee Maya R. Jasanoff ’96 said she thinks exposure to history is beneficial to all students. However, while working on the report she had to balance her desire to introduce as many students as possible to the discipline with her goals as a member of the Committee, Jasanoff said.
“As a practitioner within the field of history, I would love to see history be like the ‘thing’ that everybody takes as a freshman,” Jasanoff said.  “But I don’t feel, as a member of the Committee, in thinking about what the faculty believes and what students believe, that the place to mandate this is in... a fairly narrowly conceived requirement called Study of the Past.”
Rather than focusing on the study of the past, Jasanoff said she would like to see an emphasis on gaining understanding of change over time and that the new Gen Ed program provides ample room  for courses to do just that. For example, one of four new Gen Ed categories is called “Histories, Societies, Individuals.”
“In the earlier Gen Ed program, the word history doesn’t appear anywhere, and from my point of view as a historian, having the word ‘history’ just put into students’ consciousness is important,” Jasanoff said.
History professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74—who proposed the amendment to the current Gen Ed program that led to the addition of the Study of the Past requirement in 2007—said the “Histories, Societies, Individuals” classification alleviates some of his initial  concerns about the loss of the requirement.
“People in the History Department were very concerned that [in] those eight categories that we currently have, none of them reference the past,” he said, referring to the current program.
He said that the classification “Histories, Societies, Individuals” will be sufficient if people interpret the commas in its title to mean “and” instead of “or.”
“I think probably that a lot of it comes down to how the committee will interpret it—not the people who wrote the report, but the committee going forward if this gets adopted,” Gordon said. The proposal awaits Faculty approval; they are expected to vote on the Gen Ed review committee's proposal soon.
Jasanoff said she is unsure how the classification will be interpreted.
History Department Chair David R. Armitage said many of his colleagues emphasized the need for Study of the Past in Faculty meetings before a history component was explicitly added, but an apparent tide of discontent has somewhat subsided with the inclusion of “Histories, Societies, Individuals.”
“[History] is  an extremely important part of any form of intellectual understanding that will be communicated through the Gen Ed program,” he said.
At a Faculty meeting in December, General Education review committee chair Sean D. Kelly cautioned against creating too- narrow Gen Ed categories, arguing that they would not be effective.
Some members of the History Department remain unconvinced. History professor Michael Szonyi said that he is “deeply concerned” about the proposed discontinuation of the requirement.
“I realize that there are contending priorities, but it seems to me that part of a proper general education curriculum should be some encounter with thinking historically,” he said.

A Massachusetts magistrate judge recommended that the District Court deny Harvard’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit that alleges the University is discriminating against deaf and hard of hearing individuals by not providing closed captioning for all online content.
“Having reviewed all of the pleadings relating to this motion… and having heard the parties at oral argument, for the reasons set forth below, the court recommends that Harvard’s motion be denied in its entirety,”  Katherine A. Robertson, a judge for the Massachusetts District Court, wrote in a filing on Feb. 9.
If accepted, Robertson’s recommendation would mean that the suit filed last year by the National Association of the Deaf will proceed into further litigation.
In the original complaint, the plaintiffs cited Youtube videos, podcasts, and edX courses—part of a joint venture between Harvard and MIT—as examples of Harvard’s online content that purportedly deny access to deaf and hard-of-hearing people.
The complaint alleges that Harvard has violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the American Disabilities Act of 1990 by not inserting digital captions into online educational content. The former mandates that federally-funded educational institutions provide equal access to all individuals, regardless of disabilities. The latter law mandates that public places of accommodation “not deny persons with disabilities” their services.
Harvard sought to delay or dismiss the case until the U.S. Department of Justice issued specific digital provisions of the ADA given the lack of current legal precedence for online public spaces.
Interpretations of the ADA have varied since the original law went into effect in 1990, according to Caroline Jackson, an attorney for the National Association of the Deaf.
“Back then, public life was tangible. It was the stores you could walk into, it was the sidewalks you could get on, it was the doctors that you could go see in person,” Jackson said. “Since then, public sphere has become intangible; it’s become the cybersphere.”
The plaintiffs seek a settlement that would require Harvard to caption all of its online material.
“Expanding access to knowledge and making online learning content accessible is of vital importance to Harvard and to educational institutions across the country.  We cannot, however, comment on potential or ongoing litigation,” University spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement.

Since the first campus Snapchat geofilter came to Harvard last February, a number of students have brought a slew of new designs to showcase on-campus spots. 
Picture-messaging application Snapchat first launched geofilters in the summer of 2014. The location-based stickers, which creatively tag the place someone takes a Snapchat photo, quickly took off among college-aged users, but Harvard seemed to lag behind the trend,  Alana M. Steinberg ’18, a Crimson multimedia editor, observed.
“I saw all of my friends at different schools with these geofilters,” she said. “We were late in the game.”
Steinberg, who did graphic design in high school, decided to take matters into her own hands and soon brought Harvard its very first filter: a “Harvard” header in classic red and white script. The project was so well-received that Steinberg quickly followed up with more, creating geofilters for the Radciffe Quad, Annenberg Hall, and, most recently, Widener Library.
The popularity of Steinberg’s designs inspired a number of campus groups, including extracurricular organizations and social clubs, to seek out her services to get filters of their own.
“Several organizations have come up to me asking,” Steinberg said. “I do a good amount of consulting on geofilters also.”
Other groups developed their own designs. The Harvard Advocate, an undergraduate literary magazine, launched a filter for its headquarters at 21 South Street on Feb. 10.
Advocate Design Editor Mahan Nekoui ’17 said the focus of the geofilter project was the larger campus community, not merely the magazine staff.
“This is for the magazine, sure, but it’s also for the readers, the community, and everybody that interacts with The Advocate,” he said.
Harvard’s residential Houses have also recognized the community-building potential of the Snapchat geofilter feature. Available in and around Mather, for example, is a filter that features the House’s distinctive concrete tower.
“I really think it helps broadcast a sense of unity among Mather residents,” Mather House Committee co-chair Trevor A. Mullin ’17 said, though he does not know who was responsible for creating the filter.
Other Houses are actively working toward publishing Snapchat geofilters of their own. The Leverett House Committee hopes that a Leverett geofilter will soon allow residents to share their House spirit with the rest of the campus community.  The Eliot House Committee is also looking into the possibility of making one, Eliot House Committee co-chair Larissa M. Rocha ’17 said.
The rapid growth in the number of Snapchat geofilters available across campus is an entirely student-led phenomenon. In theory, anyone can design and submit a new filter to Snapchat’s website for review.
“Anyone who knows how to use photoshop and can make these in the right format is able to make one,” Steinberg said. However, she also noted the difficulty of getting submissions approved. “It’s actually much more difficult than people realize,” she added.
Though the trend is not related to any official efforts by Harvard administrators or the Undergraduate Council, UC Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said the geofilters serve their goals for reshaping social life at the College.
“The really cool thing about [geofilters] from a student government perspective is that this is something that we haven’t had to sort of push people to do,” he said. “People are deciding, in some small way, to improve social life on campus on their own.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 25, 2016, at 10:26 p.m.
This March, some undergraduates can eat Felipe’s burritos and Hong Kong’s scallion pancakes on Harvard’s dime.
A new spring break meal plan will close all House dining halls and instead allocate students on financial aid cash stipends for meals during spring break, according to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
In lieu of dining hall meals, undergraduates on high levels of financial aid will qualify for $225 allotments throughout the week-long break, an equivalent of $25 dollars per day to spend on food, Khurana said. Students who do not currently receive aid from the College may consult their resident deans to determine whether or not they qualify for the funding, Khurana said.
“There will be no restrictions on the funds,” Khurana said.  “Students can use them to meet a variety of their expenses, whether they want to buy groceries and cook in their residential kitchens to going out with friends.”
The new system gives students additional flexibility, Khurana said, since administrators will have no oversight over how students will spend their stipends.
The current spring break dining plan differs from a pilot program the College launched last spring break, when dining halls in Currier House and Dunster House provided brunch, lunch, and dinner service during the week. A student-faculty group focusing on diversity and inclusion as well as the Working Group on First Generation College Students recommended expanding spring break dining policies, according to Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College's assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Anticipating criticism that closing dining halls could jeopardize House life over spring break, Khurana said he will host group events for students, such as gatherings with pizza.
Khurana said administrators will soon notify students who are eligible for the spring break funding.

CLARIFICATION: February 25, 2016
An earlier version of this article stated that Khurana said undergraduates on financial aid would qualify for the spring break stipends. To clarify, students on high financial aid packages will qualify for the funds.

A lawsuit brought against Harvard’s practice of affirmative action has moved into the discovery stage with both sides stuck in a protracted back-and-forth battle over access to documents.
However, the negotiations are advancing slowly during the partial suspension of court proceedings pending the Supreme Court’s ruling on affirmative action expected later this year.
The case was brought forward by an anti-affirmative action group known as Students for Fair Admissions and alleges that Harvard’s admissions process discriminates against Asian American applicants. The case is in a stage known as “discovery,” during which both Students for Fair Admissions and Harvard’s attorneys have the opportunity to request information from each other for use in court proceedings.
Although the plaintiffs originally brought the suit against the University in the fall of 2014, Harvard argued that discovery should be placed completely on hold pending a decision in the related affirmative action Supreme Court case Fisher v. Texas.
In the last month, lawyers for both sides have filed a combined total of four motions to seal documents, according to court records. Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who is presiding over the case, is thus able to view unredacted copies of documents containing sensitive information. Information about Harvard’s admissions process, as well as excerpts from testimony by Harvard Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath, have been redacted from the publicly released versions of those letters.
Edward Blum, the president of Students for Fair Admissions, said the discovery process has been “pretty garden-variety.”
Specifically, Blum criticized Harvard for withholding information about the role race plays in its admissions process while requesting information about the unknown claimants behind the lawsuit.
“Harvard has data and documents that will contain personal information about students and application information that they would like only the attorneys for the litigants to see, and we would like the same courtesy concerning our students and who they are,” he said.
While the discovery process “hasn’t been stopped completely,” Blum said, “it is on slow motion until the Fisher decision is released.”
Experts have previously predicted Fisher could affect Harvard’s case, although the University of Texas is a public university and the outcome would not necessarily apply to Harvard, a private university. Further litigation would likely be required to hash out the legal implications for private universities.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University who specializes in higher education law, said he was not surprised by the challenges arising in the discovery process, which he termed “border wars over who gets to see which documents.”
Lake said the conflict seemed in part due to disagreement between both sides over how best to protect the confidentiality of students and applicants.
“There’s a number of people whose privacy could be compromised,” he added. “Most admissions committees like to operate with a certain amount of autonomy, so that they can have candid discussions about individual applicants.”
Harvard administrators have strongly advocated for current affirmative action practices.
University President Drew G. Faust has promised a “vigorous defense” of Harvard’s consideration of race in its admissions process. Harvard’s General Counsel, Robert W. Iuliano ’83, has also said in response to the lawsuit that colleges “must continue to have the freedom and flexibility to consider each person’s unique backgrounds and life experiences” in their admissions processes.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven declined to comment.

UPDATED: February 25, 2016, at 1:45 p.m.
Organizers of a graduate student unionization effort confirmed the campaign has reached a critical point: a majority of graduate students employed by the University  have signed authorization cards in support of unionization, which satisfies the threshold to call an election to form a union.
“I know that we’re above 60 percent, and that majority is growing,” Chamith Y. Fonseka,  a union organizer and PhD student in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences, said.
A student who signs the card authorizes the movement, called the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, “to represent me for the purposes of collective bargaining with my employer over wages, benefits, working conditions and other terms and conditions of employment.” 
The card includes the question: “What matters most to you as a graduate worker at Harvard?” Signers can check off options including “childcare/parental leave,” “sexual assault policy,” “job security/fair process,” “health: mental, dental and vision,” and more.
HGSU-UAW technically has enough signatures to call an election to form a union. The National Labor Relations Board mandates that 30 percent of employees need to sign authorization cards in order to hold an election; HGSU-UAW has over 60 percent of worker support, Fonseka said. As it currently stands, Harvard does not need to legally recognize a union of graduate employees based on a 2004 NLRB  ruling. This may change in coming months as the NLRB is set to decide on student workers at the New School.
“When an election is called, people will independently vote to be represented,” Fonseka said. “These cards are for us to gauge the level of support in the community and as well, trying to know what issues people are interested in.”
Union organizer and History graduate student Aaron T. Bekemeyer said the majority reflects the portion of the more than 4,000 students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who are employed by Harvard, meaning they are teaching fellows or research assistants. He clarified that not all 14,500 graduate and professional students enrolled in Harvard’s graduate schools work for the University.
“When you’re working for the University, you’re considered a grad employee,” Bekemeyer said. “So for instance, someone in my department, the History department, when they come in as a first year and they’re just taking classes, they don’t have an employment relationship with the University at that point.”
GSAS is the only school at Harvard able to grant Ph.D.s, so any student enrolled in a Ph.D. program technically receives that degree from GSAS. On its website, GSAS boasts 16 interfaculty Ph.D. programs.
For that reason, the HGSU-UAW’s majority support comes from all of Harvard’s graduate schools, according to Bekemeyer.
“I think it was really encouraging to see that people were willing to kind of communicate and work together across disciplines,” Fonseka said.
GSAS Dean for Administration and Finance Allen Aloise wrote in an email that the administration is committed to helping GSAS students complete their studies and help them navigate challenges that they face while at Harvard.
"We welcome a full and open conversation on these important issues, encouraging graduate students to ask questions and get answers on the impact of unionization,” Aloise wrote. “We believe that the relationship between graduate students and a university is fundamentally about education not employment.”
Bekemeyer said he thinks that even if a student is not currently defined as a graduate "worker,” every graduate student has a stake in the movement.
“It’s ultimately something that, in one way or another, every grad student is concerned about, in terms of the voice they have and the conditions of their work and how secure their work is, whether there is due process for their employment,” Bekemeyer said.
He added that the number of graduate employees is in flux because of students' movement  into and out of teaching positions and research assistantships.
Bekemeyer said he is excited about the majority, but added he  was always confident that the threshold would be reached.
“We’re continuing the card campaign this semester,” he said. “We have a majority, but we want that to be a larger and more substantial and powerful majority as we go forward, so we’re pushing it as high as we can.”

Harvard Republicans report “mourning” Jeb Bush’s candidacy as businessman Donald J. Trump continues to dominate the Republican field after successive wins.
Bush dropped out of the presidential race amidst the flurry of the South Carolina Republican primary. Trump ended the night with a resounding victory, gaining all 50 of South Carolina’s delegates.
The former Florida Governor had a relatively disproportionate following within the Harvard Republican Club. Almost 50 percent of Club members voiced their support for Bush in an internal straw poll conducted last November.
Bush supporters on campus, like Gwen R. Thomas ’17, Harvard Republican Club president, called Bush a “compassionate,” “good man,” who was eclipsed in an election season dominated by Trump.
“Jeb, and every candidate, got steamrolled by Trump, which was completely unexpected,” Thomas said.
“I really did really think he would be a great president. I think that America missed out a little bit with him,” Declan P. Garvey ’17, who campaigned for Bush, said.
Despite his disappointment, Kent Haeffner ’18, who led Harvard Students for Jeb Bush, praised Bush as “admirable” for leaving the race at this stage.
“I think he realized that if he stayed in the race, he would have taken votes away from folks, like Rubio and Kasich, who would be able to take down Trump,” he said. “I think he cares enough about our party and our country that he was willing to put the own personal ambitions aside to do what’s best.”
Bush’s withdrawal was worrisome for his supporters on campus, who generally reject Trump. After he won in Nevada and New Hampshire, pundits have already started to call the race for the controversial real estate mogul.
“I have promised that I will not cast a vote for Donald Trump,” Garvey said.
As the race narrows down, most of Harvard’s former Jeb supporters have turned to Senator Marco Rubio, another strong performer in the Republican  Club straw poll, in the hopes that a mainstream Republican can bring Trump down.
Aaron I. Henricks ’16, former president of the Republican Club, said he will “go through a phase of mourning,” but will likely vote for Rubio, or another candidate who he thinks can bring down the reality T.V. star.
“People need to wake up and drop out and support one person or something,” he said. “Things could be really bad with Trump.”
The Harvard Republican Club will not endorse a candidate during the primary season. Given the “exceptional circumstances,” they won’t rally on the streets “to make America great again” anytime soon, Thomas said.
“I’m very sad about it because I think Jeb’s a good man. Jeb’s a man of character,” Thomas said. “He stood up to Trump and stood up for what he believed in even if that wasn’t popular. I think it takes a lot of courage and a lot of conviction to do that.”

Undergraduate activist organization Student Labor Action Movement held a “Speak Out” event in support of the workers ahead of negotiations between Harvard and its dining services workers.
Harvard students and employees from across the University voiced their concerns over the details of the health care package that Harvard initially introduced  to its non-union employees—a contract that some members believe will be offered to Harvard University Dining Services once they begin negotiations. This highly controversial contract included deductibles and coinsurance payments that some professors argued would unfairly burden junior faculty members and those with families. Later, after vetting criticism of the benefits package, Harvard added another plan without deductibles.
A recent contract between Harvard and its largest employee union offered a healthcare plan different than the original non-union employee plan, featuring premium contribution tiers for individuals earning less than $55,000.
Speakers at the event called overwhelmingly for a “coalition” of students and staff at Harvard to rally behind HUDS and other campus workers in pursuit of a different health care plan. Ten campus organizations, including the Harvard College Democrats, Divest Harvard, and Occupy Harvard Law School attended the event in support of Harvard workers. 
“You know, obviously, it kind of seems like dining services is underappreciated because we just put food out for you guys, but to know that other students are behind us and are supporting us in this fight is amazing,” Laquiesha N. Rainey, a general cook in Lowell and Winthrop houses, said. “I couldn’t be happier to have a system, and a network behind us to make sure that we get what we deserve.”
Rainey discussed a theme HUDS is emphasizing during its negotiation process, “Sustainable Lives,” which calls on Harvard to understand how changes in health care benefits affect the individual lives of union members.
Speeches were sometimes filled with fierce rhetoric against the University. A few speakers also critiqued the University’s largest employee union, Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
At least one HUCTW member, Thompson Potter, attended the event to voice support for the dining workers and express concern at the impending ratification vote of the tentative agreement reached between Harvard and HUCTW.
Potter called for “militant union activism” to address the health care packages that the University is extending to its union members.
“This deal enshrines the very costs, the very fights that you are fighting for,” Potter said.
Attendance at the event was large enough that there was barely standing room left, and attendees had to cycle out of the room regularly to allow newcomers to listen to the speeches.
Members of SLAM said they were “really excited” about the amount of support that the event drew from Harvard affiliates. “We had some really incredible speakers,” Sam R. Heller ’18, a member of SLAM said.

“Forget Yale—the Crimson-Tiger rivalry is rapidly becoming the confrontation to talk about.”
So wrote Crimson sports writer Jill Brenner in 1995, several months before the college men’s swimming and diving season began.
In the short term, the prediction proved accurate, as Harvard upended reigning champion Princeton en route to the 1995-1996 title.
But Brenner was incorrect in one respect: the word “rapidly.” Crimson-Tiger dominance stretches back nearly a half-century, and no men’s swim team other than Harvard or Princeton has been an outright Ivy League title winner since 1971. That’s a 44-year streak of co-hegemony.
“The championship meet was the competition we looked forward to all season,” recalled Michael D. Smith, once a Princeton swim captain in 1983 and now the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “To be in the pool with the best, especially during the relays, brought out exceptional performances every year.”
This Thursday the Crimson (9-1, 6-1 Ivy) heads to Providence, R.I. for the 2016 Ivy League Championships, fully aware of this long history of rivalry. This time around, Harvard is an underdog after conceding the conference title to Princeton (7-0, 7-0) last season and falling to the Tigers, 224.5-126.5, at the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet this January.
“The competition is huge between our two teams,” co-captain Christian Yeager said. “Princeton is always on our mind. Those are the guys who took away our Ivy League title last year, and the fact that it’s always been so back and forth.leads us to really focus on that competition in practice every single day.”
Despite Princeton’s resounding win in the H-Y-P meet, Harvard has been targeting the Ivy Championships all season, and the Crimson is prepared to hit its best performances of the season this weekend.
“The nature of swimming is that no one really shows their cards until Ivy’s roll around,” said former captain Griffin Schumacher '15.
In past years, Harvard has tapered before big meets such as the Texas Invitational and H-Y-P. However, men’s swimming and diving coach Kevin Tyrrell decided that this year his team would keep the practice yardage and intensity up throughout the season in preparation for this championship meet.
“Physically we’re in a different place now than we’ve been in the entire year,” said Yeager. “When we went to race Princeton and Yale we swam tired…whereas for the past three weeks [our] practices have been much shorter.”
Harvard is in a strong position to take home top places in a number of individual events. Sophomore Logan Houck has the Ivy League’s second-fastest 1,000 freestyle, less than 3/10ths of a second off the fastest time of 9:10.38.
In addition Jack Manchester is fighting to break the Ivy League record in the 200 backstroke, a mark that he set last year. To win he will have to beat Princeton junior standout En-Wei Hu-Van Wright, who took top marks in the 100 back, as well as the 50 free and 100 free at HYP.
Both Yeager and Schumacher stressed that the sprint freestyle and butterfly events are must-watch. Junior Max Yakubovich and sophomore Steven Tan enter the 100 fly with the first- and third-fastest times in the league, respectively.
Mike Mosca '15 dominated the Ivy League in diving last year, and in the women’s championship last weekend, the Harvard divers played a crucial role in securing the title win. The group of sophomore David Pfeifer, sophomore Bobby Ross and freshman Luke Martinez are looking to continue the Crimson’s diving success. Pfeifer has already found the podium multiple times against Ivy League competition this season.
“I really like…the closeness between the divers and the swimmers on our team,” said Coach Tyrrell. “They’re always cheering for each other and communicating... It makes a good environment for them all to raise the bar for each other.”
Along with offering a chance to win the conference title, the championship meet also serves as Harvard’s best opportunity to qualify swimmers for the NCAA championships. As a conference, the Ancient Eight is hoping to make its mark at NCAA’s this year.
“It’s definitely something that brings us all together,” explained Schumacher. “I know that come relays everyone’s going to be pretty fired up and calling each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The start of the postseason marks a set of new beginnings in college hockey. More precisely, for the Harvard women’s ice hockey team, this weekend represents a fork in the road.
On one side: Win and keep alive hopes of repeating last year’s run to the national championship game.
On the other side: Lose and return to Cambridge empty-handed.
This “second season” has become familiar territory for the Crimson (16-10-3, 12-7-3 ECAC), as the team has reached the ECAC semifinal in every year since the turn of the millennium. The 2015-2016 rendition of the ECAC conference tournament finds the Crimson travelling to Colgate’s campus in Hamilton, N.Y. to take on the No. 9/9 Raiders for the second weekend in a row.
As a result of splitting last weekend’s decisions at Cornell and Colgate, Harvard lost control of home-ice advantage in the ECAC playoffs. Now the team will be forced to travel once again in order to keep its national championship hopes alive.
“It’s obviously not ideal, but I think we play well on the road,” freshman defender Kate Hallett said. “We want to go into the rink against Colgate and take over. Obviously having that home ice advantage would have been great, but we don’t. We need to go onto the next thing. We’ll take what we’ve got and move on to the next situation.”
The Crimson comes into the game ranked fifth on the ECAC ladder, one notch below the Raiders. This coming Friday will be the third time that the teams have met up this year, with Harvard coming away victorious in both of the previous matchups. The crossover of conference play throughout the regular season has allowed the two teams to get familiar with each other’s styles of play.
Last Friday, in the most recent matchup between the two, the Crimson was able to skate past Colgate to a 3-2 victory on a goal late in the third period from freshman Grace Zarzecki. But the teams were neck-in-neck for essentially all of the contest. Zarzecki’s shot, which was Harvard’s 28th of the night, was the difference between a tie in shots taken, as the Raiders tallied 27 on the night.
Hoping that the third matchup will yield the same result as the first two, the Crimson is using previous skating experience against its opponent in order to build upon its strategy.
“It gives us a sense of comfort that we were on that ice, that we played extremely well on that ice, and that we won on that ice,” freshman forward Chelsea Zaidie said. “Being familiar with the facility and things like that are helpful, but it will be a new game and a new opportunity to play our best.”
More important than the level of comfort is the need for execution on the ice. In the month of February, Harvard has gone 3-for-22 in power play opportunities, squandering many opportunities to score with a man-up advantage. Its overall power play percentage of 16.4 ranks the team in the middle of the pack in the ECAC and 22nd in the nation.
“We have a lot of power play opportunities, and something we really need to focus on is taking advantage of those opportunities by scoring,” ZIadie said.
On the defensive side of the puck, senior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer comes into the game third in the ECAC in save percentage and fifth in total saves. In contrast to the team’s offensive struggles concerning the power play, the Crimson has the sixth-best penalty kill in the nation at an 89.7 percentage.
Overall team defense has been a high point in the season, as Harvard is ranked seventh in the nation with 1.76 goals allowed per game. Meanwhile Colgate sits in the 15th spot, allowing an average of 2.18 goals.
Stacking up against conference competition, junior forward Sydney Daniels and senior Miye D’Oench stand atop the offensive leaderboards. D’Oench’s 35 points on the season and Daniels’ 18 goals land them both in the top five among ECAC rivals.
Yet all the stats can be thrown out the window now that the team is facing a win or go home situation in the postseason.
“It’s late in the season, so we know the system. We know what we’re supposed to do,” Hallett said. “The key to it is is execution. The main thing in practice this weekend and the games this weekend is just going to be giving 100 percent, 100 percent of the time, and really focusing in on what we have to do in order to get the job done.”

Apparently Junior Parents Weekend, also known as Junior Parents “Invited-To-Harvard-So-The-Coop-Sells-Its-Quota-Of-Class-Rings” Weekend, commences tomorrow. If only one of the countless Deans of Harvard sent as many emails about Junior Parents Weekend as they send about the weather, we juniors wouldn’t be scrambling to simultaneously rid our rooms of sin and determine the purpose of Junior Parents Weekend before our sweet parents arrive. Since the “tentative” Class of 2017 Junior Parents Weekend schedule is far too many Google searches and PDF downloads away, we here at Flyby have done you the favor of acknowledging the most important (read: absurd) events offered during Junior Parents Weekend 2016.
Nature Walk in HarvardHarvard Square is known for its plethora of nature, from its receding grass patches to its occasional tree stumps to its notorious turkey. We just hope Pfister and his fungi make an appearance.
Jogging Tour of Harvard & Fun RunWe really hope this is a sick joke. Also, are the jogging tour and fun run two separate entities?
Class of 2017 Ring SizingsBecause nothing screams “family fun” more than getting fitted for a ring that’ll cost your parents their flight home.
Green Tour of Harvard YardThis sounds illegal in every state but Washington and Colorado.
Music and MemoriesIs this an event, or the name of One Direction’s next single?
Searching For SignalWe’ve seen enough.
Pro Tip: If your parents are kind of the worst and forgot to make reservations for dinner, fear not. For an ever-so reasonable $18.25 each, mom and dad can join you for a delightful HUDS supper (because beef meatballs and soup du jour sound too good to pass up).
So there you have it– Flyby’s Guide to the Most Absurd Junior Parents Weekend. We wish you and your parents an unforgettable weekend of rings, nature, and “green.”
