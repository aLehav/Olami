After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The most surprising aspect of Justin Kurzel’s new adaptation of “Macbeth” is its lack of dialogue. The brooding film devotes much of its two-hour runtime to resplendent visuals, showcasing the Scottish highlands through a variety of dark colors and filters. As Macbeth slowly realizes his inevitable tragic fate, Kurzel shifts from the deep blues of the first act into a red, hellish landscape that mirrors the protagonist’s state of mind and soul.
Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard make for a wonderfully compelling team of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, bringing a nuanced take on the Bard’s characters. Unlike traditional portrayals, the two actors ground the story’s political conflict on preserving their characters’ relationship . Script co-writers Jacob Koskoff, Todd Louiso, and Michael Lesslie also take certain liberties of interpretation with the source material—in a departure from some scholarly interpretations that Lady Macbeth is barren, the film’s first scene explicitly portrays the funeral of the couple’s young daughter.
These minor changes, along with the script’s heavy trimming, might upset Shakespeare purists—though famous soliloquies, such as that containing the famous line “Unsex me here,” still remain. The film also runs into trouble with some of the dialogue’s delivery—the guttural, Batman-like growling of Fassbender and the film’s other Scotsmen is often indecipherable, and even English native speakers would benefit from subtitles in viewings of the film.
It is clear that Kurzel has a very specific and ambitious vision for his adaptation, and this shows in his detailed attention to style. With the help of cinematographer Adam Arkapaw, Kurzel often pulls off haunting wide shots of the mountainous Scottish landscape or thrilling slow-motion action sequences. The latter type occurs sparingly, and, unlike in films such as “300,” these shots convey the traumatic atmosphere of the battlefield without being comical. Although the film is certainly a non-traditional adaptation within the realm of Shakespeare films, it is one that leverages its medium to greatest effect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years after “The Great Beauty,” a grandiose love letter to Rome, director Paolo Sorrentino has returns with a film extremely similar in regard both to the style and to the story. However, there is a subtle but important difference between “Youth” and Sorrentino’s acclaimed previous piece: “Youth” deals with a group of people much older than those in “The Great Beauty,” and they are either tired of life or unable to enjoy it as they used to. Instead of partying everywhere in Rome, they are stuck in a resort hotel at the foot of the Alps. Much like a quiet retirement, “Youth” has a charm of its own, but it is something of a disappointment after “The Great Beauty.”
This difference directly influences the cinematography of the film. While “Youth” contains many of Sorrentino’s signature parallel montages and complex camera movements, they are reserved by his standards. Most of these shots are much slower and more contemplative than those in his other films, and, throughout the “Youth” there is a sense of anxiety and boredom as these beautiful shots finally cadence to daily triviality. The majority of the film happens only in a rather ordinary hotel, in which guests have nothing to do but sit on the lawn, eat in the dining hall, and kill time in the swimming pool. While the two main characters Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) often plan to go to other places, they eventually have to return to their resort. For this reason, gorgeous mountain and city shots cut back to dull hotel scenes, and so Sorrentino conveys the futility of trying to return to one’s youth.
Most people in the hotel, though, are nevertheless obsessed with their youth in one way or other. The fat retired soccer player tries to pick up his craft again and is always delighted to give autographs. The washed-up actress wishes to stay relevant and is doing a TV series in Mexico. The protagonist Ballinger always talks about old anecdotes with his best buddy Boyle, remembering, among many things, all the beautiful women they did not have the chance to sleep with. Ballinger is a renowned composer who used to be close with Stravinsky and has recently been invited to conduct his most popular piece, “Simple Songs,” for the Queen of England. However, he refuses the offer due to unexplained “personal reasons.” Boyle is a veteran film director, and is working with a group of aspiring young people on an ambitious screenplay that he hopes will be his testament to life. Sorrentino effectively keeps this theme of obsession in focus without ever becoming repetitive or didactic.
Both Ballinger and Boyle live in a beautiful nostalgia for the lost time, but they have a fundamental difference: As Ballinger puts it, “I never really loved life.” Ballinger is a mixture of hedonism, cynicism, and pessimism, a personality almost identical to that of the protagonist of “The Great Beauty.” Michael Caine’s performance of the character, however, gives the archetype additional layers. He is a witty but self-belittling intellect, a sometimes-stubborn old man, and a father full of regrets of past ignorance of his daughter.
The biggest problem of “Youth” is that, despite the nuances of the theme and the protagonist, its style is essentially the same as “The Great Beauty,” just on a smaller scale and one less appropriate to the film’s general atmosphere of decay and ennui. It would have been preferable for Sorrentino to develop a different approach more closely suited to the film. In some scenes, it is evident that Sorrentino wants to go grander, as his cinematographic style demands, but restrains himself because the story does not allow him this luxury. This split eventually prevents the movie from becoming a true masterpiece.

This is the first part of our three-part series on the May 2015 Boston Calling music festival. The next two parts can be read here and here.
The setup of Boston Calling—three days of sets, progressing from lesser-known artists in the afternoon to big names and headliners at night—means it always starts almost unnoticeably. The opening of this May’s instance of the festival was no different: When Sharon Van Etten took the stage at 6:20 p.m. on Friday, audience members were still filtering into City Hall Plaza, and the modestly sized group waiting before the jetBlue stage seemed comprised mostly of early arrivers who wanted to ensure front-row spots for Beck at 9:20 p.m. Van Etten, however, managed to attract a substantial crowd before the end of her 40-minute set. She opened with “Serpents,” the highlight off of 2012’s “The Tramp,” and quite quickly drew in an audience from across the plaza. Her set pulled in a variety of material from her discography, all impressively performed—particularly with the support of her skilled guitarist—and she even introduced a new track, “All Over Again,” which was met with substantial applause. And she wisely saved the best for last: Her performance of “Don’t Do It,” from 2010’s “Epic,” was positively radiant. A strong representation of the indie-folk side of Boston Calling’s largely indie offerings, Van Etten proved resoundingly that the festival’s afternoon performers are not to be ignored.
Almost as soon as Van Etten left the stage, a cloud of pungent smoke began percolating over the audience, announcing Australian psychedelic outfit Tame Impala’s imminent arrival. Their set, which heavily featured 2012’s Grammy-nominated “Lonerism,” was aurally impressive—their mesmerizing, atmospheric tracks were even better than the album versions when heard live from within an enraptured crowd. And, as is only natural for such a group, the visuals that played behind the band were hypnotizing: dancing lines in colors on a red-to-blue spectrum that rhythmically accompanied the music—the solid rhythm of “Elephant,” for example, was represented visually by a series of colorful concentric circles. Whether from the music or the visuals or the secondhand smoke, the crowd received Tame Impala with cheering adoration, which their performance absolutely merited.
The hour-long delay that preceded festival headliner and 2015 Grammy-winner Beck’s performance was perhaps at that point needed. In that interim, a prodigious crowd gathered—by the time Beck took the stage, the entirety of City Hall Plaza seemed filled. The area in front of the Red Stage, which was not used on Friday, was hardly less densely filled than that in front of the jetBlue Stage, on which Beck performed. This is perhaps unsurprising, as acquiring Beck as festival headliner was certainly the greatest triumph of Boston Calling’s planning committee, at least from an objective standpoint. Not only did he win Album of the Year at the most recent Grammy Awards, but he—as well as fellow headliners The Pixies—released a couple of singles in the 90s that are more or less universally known.
For this reason, Beck needed to do very little to put on a great show. The utter enthusiasm with which the crowd met 1994’s “Loser” and 1996’s “Where It's At”—the latter of which Beck used to close his set—produced some of the most enjoyable moments of the entire weekend. This is not to say, however, that Beck did not otherwise put on a good performance; rather the opposite, as he allowed his personality and humor to shine alongside his music onstage. From moments when he lay down onstage, stating himself to be comfortable enough with the audience to do so, to an entirely needless costume change before his encore, Beck established a rapport with the audience that entirely made up for any technical issues in his performance. Beck’s two decades of popularity put him uniquely in a position to generate excitement from every member of the diverse Boston Calling audience, and their enthusiastic reaction indicated that he succeeded.
Boston Calling certainly operates at a smaller scale than more famous festivals with longer pedigrees—it only ever brings in a couple of artists as big as Beck—but it has a great deal to recommend it beyond its convenience for locals. As Tame Impala frontman Kevin Parker observed during his performance. there is something particularly epic about music performed in the heart of the city, under buildings dozens of stories high.

This is the second part of our three-part series on the May 2015 Boston Calling music festival. The other two parts can be read here and here.
The organizers of Boston Calling appear to have put some effort into partitioning the weekend’s performers by genre—a boon for attendees who may only want to hear a few artists and who may then be able to buy only a single-day ticket. The composition of Saturday’s crowd, even in the early afternoon, indicated that the festival’s second day would put an emphasis on pop and electronic music, given the unusually high percentage of teenage girls in the audience—though perhaps some of the younger crowd were My Chemical Romance fans thrilled at the chance to see Gerard Way.
Danish electropop artist MØ, most famous for being featured on the Major Lazer track “Lean On,” fit neatly into the apparent focus of Saturday’s lineup and was a highlight of the early afternoon performances. At the beginning of her set she burst onstage in bold sunglasses and with two braided buns atop her head, and, though her energetic and entertaining dancing caused her hair to unravel over the course of her set, she gamely continued leaping about and bobbing her head—with renewed vigor, if anything. She also evidenced impressive vocal chops not immediately obvious in the studio versions of her electropop songs. A consummate performer, MØ seemed to connect with her entire audience, and not only its young contingent.
The day’s performances, of course, did not solely cater to pop fans: After MØ’s set, rap duo Run the Jewels wooed their audience by coming onstage to Queen’s “We Are The Champions”—to which, of course, the whole crowd sang along. Impressively in touch with each other throughout the performance, Killer Mike and El-P drew on a variety of content from their two albums to date—creatively titled “Run the Jewels” and “Run the Jewels 2.” The pair even incorporated a political statement into their set and gave a shout-out to Ireland, which had voted in favor of gay marriage the previous day. Unsurprisingly, the crowd appeared unanimously in favor of their statement, and it was up to Swedish pop singer Tove Lo to scandalize the audience. During “Talking Body,” she briefly flashed the audience—evidently a habit of hers during performances [LINK: http://www.mtv.com/news/2162945/tove-lo-flashed-audience-hangout-fest/]—and elicited cheering only rivaled by the audience response to her performance of her number three single, “Habits (Stay High).” For another artist, such a move may have seemed a somewhat cheap move, but Tove Lo’s evident humor throughout her set as well as her vocal chops and a catchy new song made for a fun and enjoyable performance.
Not so for Gerard Way, former lead singer of quintessential emo band My Chemical Romance, who seemed rather dreary throughout his entire set and so failed to drum up much enthusiasm, despite the apparent preponderance of MCR fans in the crowd. Given that the majority of his fans know him from his former band, Way made somewhat of a faux pas by failing to perform any of his old songs, particularly given that he has only come out with a single solo album since the bank broke up. Fortunately, Marina and the Diamonds, the next performer, more than made up for his bland set. Wearing a matching patterned sports bra and yoga pants, a shimmery bomber jacket, and an enormous headband declaring “Froot” (the title of her most recent album), Marina bounded on stage and connected immediately with her rather large audience, who cheered loudly throughout the entire set and seemed to know all the lyrics to her songs. A talented singer, Marina has also been remarkably successful in constructing for herself a somewhat bizarre persona, particularly since “Froot”; at Boston Calling, her stage was decorated with a colorful backdrop of planets and stars and enormous, blow-up fruits in strange hues.
But no performer on Saturday, or indeed during the entire festival, could match St. Vincent’s wonderful strangeness. She is not only a remarkably talented musician—her guitar playing was some of the best at the festival—but an inspired performer. Throughout her set, she impressively executed robot-like dance moves synchronized tightly with those of one of her keyboardists, Toko Yasuda. Indeed, she appeared to perform as a sort of android character, pretending to “power down” each time the stagehands exchanged her instrument. Though St. Vincent’s repertoire could easily make for a fantastic set if merely played straight, the more offbeat aspects of her performance provided just the right amount of whimsy to complement her unique sound.
After this performance, My Morning Jacket, the day’s final performer, at that point couldn’t be looking to give the best performance of the day, as St. Vincent had already resoundingly claimed that title. Despite their long history—like fellow headliners Beck and The Pixies, they released albums in the 90s—the band focused their set on their two-week old album, “The Waterfall,” and not solely by way of the songs they chose to perform. Drummer Patrick Hallahan’s bass drum was emblazoned with the album cover, and the cover was also projected onto the large screens to either side of the stage before the set began. Around half of the songs the band played were off of “The Waterfall”—rather than simply a move to promote their newest content, this was in fact a wise choice, as their most recent album represents some of their most cohesive and well-constructed work. And the audience responded—though perhaps not as enormous as the crowd that had turned out for Beck and though some of the teenage girls seemed to have left, an impressively large crowd remained at City Hall Plaza into the night to hear My Morning Jacket’s last few songs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson asked for a short essay for the Commencement issue. I thought essays were done after finals period, so, please, pardoon my proofreeding.
Former Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos and I thought long and hard about topics to write about. On the shortlist: “The Value of Unexpected Friendships: How Gus and Sietse Became Pals”; “The Importance of Staying Engaged as Alumni: THANK YOU KEN GRIFFIN”; and “Second Chances: Life of Gus Mayopoulos, the Serial Resigner.”
In the end, I decided to go with four brief but hopefully meaningful lessons Gus and I learned at the helm of the UC.
1. Critique this University because you love it. Harvard is obviously a great institution with brilliant, well-meaning faculty and first-rate academics, and we’re grateful to have been a part of it. But no school is perfect, and we should never be afraid to point out ways in which Harvard can better itself:
Unsatisfactory sexual assault policies and resources. Poor Gen Ed curricula. Lack of wheelchair accessibility in most dorms and Houses. A dearth of above-ground spaces on campus to promote diversity and inclusion. Frankly speaking, these are somewhat embarrassing issues, and Harvard shouldn’t hide behind the veil of its prestige to pretend they don’t exist.
So we criticize our beloved college (respectfully, of course) because we really do care about this place and want to see positive change.
When the UC held a public rally for $250K in extra funding or when we demanded more student voice in University decisions, we realized it would make some students and administrators a little uncomfortable. Erring on the side of being more “confrontational” at times wasn’t an easy choice, but in retrospect we feel it was the right one.
Change happens not when people are complacent with the status quo, but when they speak up and hold a vision for an even better future. In the words of Robert Kennedy, “Some men see things as they are and say, ‘Why?’ I dream of things that never were and ask, ‘Why not?’”
2. Decisions here frequently follow the money. More often than you might think, budgets and balances are what explain most decisions and situations at Harvard.
Why don’t we have hot breakfast every day? Budget constraints (HUDS is funded only by our board fees, and is not subsidized by the College) Why is subsidized House storage being phased out? Budget constraints (it would cost millions to cover storage fees for every student). Why is Stillman Infirmary cutting back overnight care? Budget constraints (limited resources need to be shifted towards improving daytime care and mental health services). In a place where aspirational goals and idealism run strong, budgets are often the “limiting reagent.”
As President Faust correctly reminded us in our first UC meeting with her in February 2014: “Money doesn’t fall from the sky.”
Sometimes this is perceived as the College not caring about its undergrads. While I share some students’ frustration, I would beg to differ on that point. Administrators do genuinely care about undergrads. Some of the nicest, most thoughtful, most compassionate people I’ve ever met worked in the Dean’s Office, the Office of Student Life, and the Title IX office. I have tremendous admiration for the leaders of Harvard. Yet inevitably, sometimes that gets lost in the bureaucracy that defines a large university like Harvard.
That’s not a bad thing per se. Bureaucracies are a fact of life. Budgets keep us realistic. Tradeoffs are impossible to avoid.
But they certainly make anyone’s advocacy work on campus a good deal more challenging.
3. Students here have vocal opinions and disagree about almost everything—and that’s fabulous. Keep it up.
Anyone who visits a UC meeting is no stranger to the constant raucous debate over issues as weighty as inclusivity and as petty as Robert’s Rules of Order (a style of parliamentary procedure). Throughout our term on the UC we also saw immense discord among the student body over divestment, the honor code, and final clubs.
Discussion over these topics, while sometimes frustrating, is very valuable. It made our job harder because we knew we could never satisfy everyone. But we all grew a lot from the conversations that took place.
4. As alumni, you wield great power at Harvard—stay engaged and use that influence in effective ways. On so many occasions, decisions (concerning Smith Campus Center plans, student group endowments, House storage timelines, and more) depended heavily on catering to the alumni community and their opinions on what they thought was important.
Harvard definitely prioritizes its alumni—which is great, especially now that we’re alumni—because the alumni are such a huge source of money and prestige for our university. We’ll all be joining that wonderful community as we graduate, but just know that with great power comes great responsibility.
So what can you do? Of course you can donate to Harvard via the capital campaign and support terrific, groundbreaking new programs like the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative or House renewal. Generous alumni donors have undeniably transformed the face of Harvard for the better.
However, there are other, equally important methods, too. Not everyone can (or wants to) donate large sums to Harvard, but everyone can stay aware of University issues and effect change in other ways. Read The Crimson. Read the Gazette. Stay an active citizen when it comes to campus issues. Advocate for policy reforms even after graduating. As an alumna or alumnus your voice actually matters—in some circumstances, it can be far more powerful than when you were an undergrad.
TLDR: Harvard is a complicated, at-times-frustrating, but certainly beautiful place. If you care deeply about it, continue critiquing and improving it, now and in the future.
What will you do to make a change?
Sietse K. Goffard ’15 is the First Marshal of the Class of 2015 and the former vice president of the Undergraduate Council.

Concentrations: Earth and Planetary Science with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy and History with a secondary in African and African American Studies
Houses: Quincy and Lowell
Hometowns: Albany, TX and Redford, MI
Dating since: Two-and-a-half years
Where you met: We met at Harvard. Initially we met my freshman year. We're both involved in Christian Impact so I met him there and honestly didn't really take much notice of him until he started attending the same church as me in Porter Square.
When you got engaged: He proposed last November. He went home for a little bit, back to Detroit, and he came back to Boston last May, and he started working for Toast, which is a startup based in Alewife right now. [We're getting married] June 6, at the church we met at, Hope Fellowship in Porter Square.
Most memorable date: We took just a day trip to New York City, which was crazy and really fun. After he finished his last final, the next day we took an early bus to NYC and I had never been before. He actually finished in December of 2013, and so it was Christmastime, and he taught me how to ice skate in Rockefeller Center, which was really sweet. We walked in Central Park.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Intentional, caring, and fun
What your friends would say about you: We're a quiet couple, but we're sweet and that we're good at including others in our relationship.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: One of [my father's] concerns when I came up from Texas was that I would marry a “Yankee,” because he wanted me to move back to Texas and thought marrying a Yankee would make that unlikely. And when Tim asked my father if he could marry me, my dad does consider Tim a Yankee, but my dad was really sweet about it, and while he was a little hesitant at first, I thought that was really sweet, that my dad couldn't imagine me marrying a Yankee, and now he couldn't imagine me not marrying Tim even though he considers him one.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: Since he left Harvard, I have written him a letter once a month and given him a picture that kind of represents the month. And he collected them and put them in a photo album.
I think it shows how much we care about each other and value each other but also shows a little bit of wisdom and reflection and how we evaluate our time month by month, telling each other the things that we appreciate about each other, and how we improved in communication together month by month. Initially it was while he was gone, and I continued it while it was back, so I have continued and I will write one on our wedding day. After getting married I think it'll probably be an anniversary thing, where I write a nice letter and we have a picture and we evaluate the year.
In 15 minutes you are: Continuing planning for the wedding, but doing it over a meal.
In 15 years you are: I hope that we'll be very similar, very much in love and excited to be together, and hopefully have a family and careers, but still be, despite other distractions, very intentional, and devoted to our own relationship.

Concentration: Classics
House: Leverett
Hometowns: Mission, TX and Seoul, South Korea
Dating since: November 2012
When you got married: We got engaged in South Korea in January 2014. When Moonhyung came back to Boston, we immediately applied for a marriage license and eloped in February of this year. It probably all seemed crazy to everyone, and I guess it was a bit crazy for us too but we couldn't wait. The big wedding ceremony is currently in the works, which is exciting.

Most Memorable Date: The summer after junior year, I went to Korea to intern at the Korea Herald, and Moonhyung was also there at the time. We ended up taking a trip to the southern region of the country and we spent the whole time talking and having meaningful conversations about our existence, our dreams and regrets, and all the things that mattered to us. We learned a lot about each other on that trip so it was definitely memorable.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: We both are short, silly, and smile a lot. I think it is because of those commonalities that people sometimes say we look alike even though we are of different races.
What your friends would say about you: People usually say we are outgoing and genuine. I'd say both of us are pretty loyal friends.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: Despite the complaints of liberal arts naysayers, the things you learn at Harvard can and will be useful at some point of your life. I actually started studying Korean right before I met Moonhyung and out of pure luck, one day we met and we just clicked. Now, all that hard work I put into my Korean language and culture classes is paying off, as I can connect with Moonhyung and my in-laws on a deeper level.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: The day we got married, we walked around the Newbury-Prudential area and spent too much time snacking at the mall because we are foodies. Then we ended the day by going to a sushi buffet. We love to eat and sometimes in huge portions so it was fitting that we spent such a special day eating to our hearts' content.
In 15 minutes you are: Sitting outside on the porch drinking coffee and eating toasted ddeok (Korean rice cakes).

Concentration: Statistics
House: Lowell
Hometowns: Melbourne, FL
Dating since: February 2010
Where you met: In Mrs. Teplica's class in eighth grade, but we didn't really get to know each other then. We started to become friends and then ended up dating during our junior year of high school.
Married: January 18, 2014
Most memorable date: We both really remember our first date. The day before the date, I called Carolyn out-of-the-blue and asked if she wanted to go out to dinner with me. Carolyn was busy that night, but we made plans for the next day. It was just so comfortable. We went to Olive Garden and we still remember what we ordered and talked about. At the end, I hugged Carolyn and said, "I like you," and Carolyn responded with, "I like you, too, Karl."
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Honest, caring, silly
What your friends would say about you: The combination of our similarities and differences seems to make us a really good team.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: Marriage doesn't have to be "the old ball and chain!"
An anecdote that captures your relationship: For pretty much our whole senior year of high school, we would meet twice a week at 6:30 a.m. at the Dunkin Donuts near our school for a breakfast date, and our school didn't even start until 8:30. Both our sets of parents and all our friends were amazed that we would get up so early... that's when they knew we were for real.
In 15 minutes you are: Going back to reading “House of Leaves” side by side

Concentration: Anthropology
House: Winthrop
Hometowns: Zhenjiang, China and Austin, Tex.
Dating since: Actually we never really did date. We became best friends, hung out constantly, and then got married. I don't even think we had dinner together at a restaurant until after we were married.
Where you met: In Professor Wai-Yee Li's class on Shiji, an ancient historical text. A year or so later, a friend told me someone had told her a story about a Chinese literature seminar that led to two students getting married, which was pretty funny.
When you got married: We got married my sophomore year. It was really fast I suppose. We had known each other less than a year, but it was honestly one of the easiest decisions we ever made.
Most memorable date: Well, we never really did date, but when we first became friends, I taught him about ancient Chinese poetry. I even prepared powerpoints and reserved a study room, and he taught me martial arts. He prepared a big bag for me to kick.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: I'm never sure how to answer this sort of question, so how about the names of the three video games we most often play together? Baldur's Gate, Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, and XCOM: Enemy Within.
What your friends would say about you: That I disappeared after getting married, which I completely did.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: While driving around Iceland, we listened to an audiobook of “The Silmarillion” in the car. The mood matched the scenery perfectly, and I highly recommend it.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: When I was away doing a summer program for a few months, Tim made a series of short videos chronicling our two dogs acting out the general plot of an Wuxia ("martial hero") novel. The action scenes were epic.
In 15 minutes you are: Talking with Tim for hours about random things.

Friends pay tribute to Angela R. Mathew, who died Feb. 10, 2014, in a traffic collision on the New Jersey Turnpike.
“Angela was the spirit of our team—she had the sort of positive vibe that was nothing but contagious. In life and in trial, she’d win you over with her endearing smile, her witty quips, and that larger-than-life charisma, all while convincing you that it was your idea to adore her in the first place. From her beautiful portrayals in competition to those nights she was there for you when seemingly no one else was, she taught me—all of us, really—how to feel and how to love.”
	-J. Zachary Fields ’15
“Angela was a beautiful, vibrant, loving young woman who threw herself into life. At work and at play, she radiated a carefree vitality that energized everyone around her. She was a neurobiology concentrator working to become a doctor. But she also worked to motivate young girls to pursue careers in science and medicine. As the girls she inspired grow up, Angela’s spirit will live on in a new generation of women scientists. She cannot be replaced, but her many friends will always remember her unique ability to transform ordinary moments with an excited shriek or a funny face and make them into something silly and very special. We will keep those moments with her in our hearts.”
-Howard M. Georgi ’68, Leverett House Master
“Angela’s passion to live life to the fullest was infectious. She was a constant reminder that life is to be enjoyed and valued. She was intelligent, funny, dedicated, and most importantly she was a great friend, always willing to go an extra mile to help a friend in need. We will all miss Angela and the good times that we shared with her. She will live on in the memories that we will cherish forever.”
-Andre D. Souffrant ’15
“Angela was a beautiful soul. She made everyone she spoke to feel important and loved. She radiated joy and reminds me every day to be kind.”
-Emilie M. Wigdor ’15
“There are people who make you inhale—those who strike everyone with their beauty, intelligence, humor and wit, and there are those who make you exhale—they have an ephemeral quality that puts you at ease, calms and orients you. It is a rare person who embodies both, and Angela, you were that individual. You were a wonderfully complicated, messy, triumphant person whose strength, to me at least, lay in your ability to overcome obstacles with poise and persistence and never stop laughing in the process. I don’t like trying to put a memory of you down in words because you were so dynamic , it doesn’t seem to do you justice. I know you are shining wherever you are.” -Kristina L. Tester ’14
“One night as the two of us walked back from a mock trial event, Angela said to me, ‘I don’t want to be a good doctor; I want to be a good person.’ But she already was an incredible person: the kind of friend who would always make time for people who needed her, who would know exactly the right thing to say, who could brighten people’s lives just with her personality. Angela was so many things— intelligent, thoughtful, beautiful, kind, dedicated, talented, hysterical, selfless—and I’m so privileged to have called her a teammate and friend.” -Zach J. Lustbader ’16
“Angela was an amazing superstar. She was my best friend, my twin, my pre-med partner, and neighbor. She was the most intelligent person in the room at all times, drop-dead gorgeous, and could make everyone smile. We in Leverett all miss her so much and think of her frequently.” -Angela J. Oh ’15
“Angela was an incredibly special person, and most words don’t do her justice. But my favorite thing about her was her infectious smile and laughter —so full of warmth and love—that lifted the spirits of anyone in her presence.” -Bernadette P. Wharton ’15
“There are still no words that can explain what happened. Angela was the most good-hearted, funny, and loving person I’ve ever known. To this day I still consider myself the luckiest guy in the world to have shared what little time we had together. Angela: I love you; happy graduation and know that you are—and will forever be—missed every day.” -Graham J. Wyatt ’14
“On the night of junior year formal, Angela scoured the venue in search of her dateless friends, in order to pull them to the dance floor. That’s just who she was —a caring, inclusive, sociable person. And while we miss Angela, her absence has brought her various social circles together, forging friendships that would have otherwise not formed. Angela’s spirit lives on in these beautiful, intangible ways.” -Kevin M. Huynh ’15
“Angela was a great friend, an excellent student, and an important part of many lives, including mine. It is very rare to find someone who manages to be so beautiful inside and out. I only regret that the rest of the world will not get to benefit from all the amazing things she would have done. I miss her dearly.” -Alexis C. Wilkinson ’15
"Angela was the life of every room she stepped into and she always brought with her an overwhelming sense of positive support for others." -Ryley R. Reynolds '15



Friends and family remember Mehdy Hazheer, who died in June 2011, just two months before arriving on campus for his freshman year.
“Mehdy never stepped foot on this campus as an official Harvard student, I know. And yet I’ve sensed him in Annenberg’s stained glass, in reading rooms with high ceilings, in the people I’ve grown close with, and in the stars I look to late at night, for everything that is good and beautiful in the world shares something with his spirit. When Mehdy was taken from us, I was most heartbroken about the dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of people who would not get the chance to be inspired by him, like the lucky friends of his have been. I’ll be thinking about that inspiration often during Commencement, and any time I encounter good or beauty for the rest of my days.” -Jacob D. H. Feldman ’15
“Mehdy was someone you’d meet for a moment but remember for a lifetime. He was the type of person who would only wear the most worn and torn clothes simply because he felt bad he had so much when others have so little. He was the type of person who would sleep on the floor of his bedroom instead of his bed to remind himself of what the less fortunate must live with. He was the type of person who would gladly make a fool of himself to cheer up the ones he loves. We deeply wish he could have continued with his beautiful ambitions, but in the end we know that he is much happier in heaven with the Beloved.” -Fahreen Hazheer
“Mehdy had a sage-like way about him that affected all he touched, and a deep appreciation for life and its fragility. I’ll never forget the haunting beauty of his last message to me: ‘Life is like a river, that leads to an ocean. We are guaranteed that. But I think we would all agree that it’s better to realize that earlier than later. It will be great, God-willing :)’” -Canyon S. Woodward ’15

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concentration: Applied Mathematics
House: Mather
Hometowns: Centennial, CO and North Salt Lake, UT
Dating since: April 2014
Where you met: The [Latter Day Saints] Church congregation in Boston
When you got engaged and married: Engaged in January 2015, married in May 2015

Most memorable date: On our first date, we went to the [Museum of Fine Arts] on a double date. Michael prepared a picture scavenger hunt with only pictures of paintings, and we raced the other couple to find each painting in the museum and take a picture in front posing the same way as the subjects of the paintings. We worked together seamlessly, and came away the quicker of the couples.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Laughter, teamwork, and long walks
What your friends would say about you: People always tell us they can tell when we’re close by, because you can hear our laughter from rooms away. They also say we complete each other (or rather, have started to completely become each other over time). At our wedding luncheon, one of my roommates remarked “you’re even starting to laugh like each other!”
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: We’ve discovered that relationships are the most important things in this life: our relationship with our families, our friends, and with God.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: After going to all-you-can eat sushi for lunch, as we were walking back to Mather, Michael stopped me and asked if we could make a surprise stop. As we turned the corner of JFK and Mt. Auburn, he slipped into the flower shop and spontaneously bought me a beautiful bouquet of pink tulips! The flowers sat on my window sill for a week, bringing a huge smile to my face as I remembered the spontaneous surprise each time I saw them.
In 15 minutes you are: Cleaning up wrapping paper from the wedding gifts we just opened
In 15 years you are: Somewhere in California, playing with our children, designing military aircraft, and still laughing just as hard

Concentration: Engineering Sciences
House: Adams
Hometowns: Atlanta, GA
Dating since: Ninth grade

Where you met: The eighth grade; [Seth] was the new kid. At the beginning of eighth grade we went on this field trip and he was in a canoe on this lake. And I noticed him and I was like, “Who’s that kid. He must be new. I wanna date him.”
When you got engaged: November 2013 on the Canopy Walk of the Atlanta Botanical Garden during Thanksgiving weekend.
Most memorable date: One summer at Texas A&M [University], where Seth studied, they have a library there. In the back they had a pond and it said you could go fishing in it. So we bought fishing poles and came back later that day. And we just fished for several hours in this little pond. It was great because it was so unexpected that it would be there. And we caught fish after fish after fish.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Loving, nerdy, and determined
What your friends would say about you: People say, “Wow you guys made it long distance for all this time.” They think that we’re very photogenic. We both have good smiles.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: In our respective fields, we’re both very serious and concentrated, but when we’re together we can be really fun and laughing.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: We’re graduating and then getting married in June and then going on our honeymoon in the Riviera Maya and then moving the following week to Charleston, SC and then a month or two later he’s moving to Charleston from Texas. We just figured why not put all of these life-changing events all at once.
In 15 minutes you are: Laughing at a nerdy science joke that he just told me
In 15 years you are: Taking our kids to the park

Concentrations: Computer Science and Visual and Environmental Studies
House: Leverett
Hometowns: Shenyang, China and Beijing, China
Dating since: April 28, 2014. During junior year we were both on board for Harvard China Forum, so we kind of became best friends. He was president and I was vice president, so we were just working on stuff everyday. And we went to every Lev event together.
Where you met: The beginning of sophomore year. She was the Operations Director for Harvard China Forum and I was interested in the organization, so I was at the info session. She was standing up front. After the info session, I went up to her to go talk to her and ask her about the organization. I actually saw her freshman year, too. During the [Chinese Students Association] Soiree she was standing outside of Boylston Hall making a phone call, but I didn’t talk to her at that time.
When you got engaged: We got engaged on our anniversary this year. We were having a picnic at Piers Park in south Boston—facing the harbor and Boston skyline and eating Darwin’s sandwiches when he popped the question. Afterwards we stayed at the Marriott next to the harbor and enjoyed the view there before heading back to campus the next day.
Most memorable date: We went to the White Mountains on a whim.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Partners in crime

Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: I like to invade his privacy.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: We went on a New York trip together at the beginning of junior year to attend the Colombia China Conference. The other people bailed, so it was just us. We spent the whole weekend there and we became really good friends. We lived in this super sketch Brooklyn hostel.

Concentrations: English and Social Studies
Houses: Dunster and Leverett
Hometowns: San Antonio, TX
Dating since: Since 2008
Where you met: We met in high school. I was a sophomore, and he was a junior. I live about six or seven blocks from our high school, so one day he just ran from our high school to my house and rang my doorbell and asked me out.
When you got engaged: In April of this year in Boston. We kind of just had this day all to ourselves. We were hanging out. We went to Crema for a while. We had our own sort of day. We made a reservation at a restaurant in Kendall, Hungry Mother. We went there and had this awesome meal, shared a bottle of wine. We were the last ones in the restaurant. Everything was just kind of perfect. So then we went to Beat Hotel and grabbed a drink, and went back to her room. I decided to pull an audible and ask her then.
Most memorable date: This one time, maybe a year or so after we first started dating, we had this whole date planned and had dinner reservations. And then we got locked out of his car. We were just hanging out in the alleyway for a few hours. We ended up just getting Sonic or something.
Three words to describe yourselves as a couple: Romantic, literary, and global
What your friends would say about you: Both our high school friend group and our college friend group have come up with the name Ramy. We’re just always together. We’re always going on camping and hiking trips together. We’re always reading books all day, those sorts of things.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell people: There [are] kind of these assumptions of in high school and college you’re changing so much, and that’s kind of why people don’t think of relationships being permanent. I feel like there’s always been the sense that we went through all of that. We’ve both changed a lot. It’s almost like we changed together. We changed together, we sort of grew together, but none of those changes ever pulled us apart. If anything, they brought us closer together.
An anecdote that captures your relationship: I visited him in Indonesia over winter break and visited him in his little village. It was fun just riding on the back of his motorcycle through rice paddies.
In 15 minutes you are: Skyping
In 15 years you are: Still reading, sipping some Bourbon
