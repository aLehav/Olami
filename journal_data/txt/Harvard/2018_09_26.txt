In “The House With a Clock in Its Walls,” the aforementioned clock doesn’t torment only main characters, Jonathan (Jack Black) and Lewis (Owen Vaccaro), but the audience as well; it is a constant reminder of the excruciatingly slow pace of the first half of this film. Its dramatic opening comes to a screeching halt as soon as Jonathan and Lewis first meet. Lewis’s recitals of dictionary definitions and the cliché three-piece suit with matching aviator goggles that he wears make it obvious (if the painfully awkward dialogue didn’t already) that his intelligence makes him an outcast. Jonathan is a rehash of every character Jack Black has played, only this time, he’s a cooky warlock. But a surprisingly standout performance comes from Florence (Cate Blanchett), the widowed witch with a legendary reputation, who helps Jonathan resolve the mystery.

An adaptation of the 1973 novel of the same name by John Bellairs, “The House With a Clock in Its Walls” starts off with a recently orphaned Lewis Barnavelt moving in with his mother’s brother, Jonathan Barnavelt, an experienced warlock of average power by his own account. Lewis is initially suspicious of the spooky house his uncle inhabits, and soon learns his uncle’s magical secret. Given the chance to become a warlock himself, Lewis trains tirelessly and eventually surpasses Jonathan’s expectations. Secretly hoping to bring his dead mother back to life, he commits a grave mistake and shamefully hides it. Just as an eclipse nears, their powers are put to the test as they confront a past that won’t give up without a fight. Released right before the Halloween season, this average, low-budget film seems to cater to young audiences before scarier films, like “Halloween” (2018), start premiering.

The movie’s potential to redefine the “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” genre for a new generation is undercut by Eric Kripke’s incredibly cheesy writing. The script caters to Black’s overdone sense of humor and follows virtually every trope of a Halloween horror movie, from live Jack-O-Lanterns to possessed marionettes. Making matters worse, Jonathan and Lewis have virtually no onscreen chemistry despite being family. The only time the writers hit the nail on the head is when Jonathan tells Lewis, “I can give you the right books, teach you the right spells, but that last one percent, that's up to you.” The painfully corny lines do little to make Vaccaro’s job easier, making it harder for him to bring that one percent. In every scene with Lewis and Florence, Blanchett’s performance makes Vaccaro’s seem lifeless, though Blanchett’s illustrious career and experience would no doubt put her at an advantage to showcase the character. Blanchett’s phenomenal portrayal of Florence made it so that every scene between Florence and Jonathan genuinely showcases the film’s potential, if only its casting director had just cast a different lead actor.

Director Eli Roth’s influence definitely compensates for the script. His experience with horror, having directed notable films like “Cabin Fever” and “Hostel,” makes the scenes featuring demons and witchcraft seem jarringly out of place for a supposed children’s film. The scenes are artistically unique and would fit into any R-rated horror blockbuster. The film’s score is also impressive, creating a rich atmosphere that grips the audience to their seats with impeccable timing. From a technical aspect, the film has incredible potential. But a weak script and flat acting plague it throughout.
While the film definitely explains that a warlock is definitely more than “a boy witch,” it fails to breathe new life into a story that’s been around since “Fantasia” (1940). “The House with a Clock in Its Walls” is just another cliché Halloween-themed children’s horror movie that just serves to entertain, rather than innovate an existing trope, as the the clock ticks on. While Cate Blanchett and Eli Roth are remarkable, the film fails to overcome poorly written dialogue and subpar acting by the lead character.

In “Hamnet,” written and directed by Bush Moukarzel and Ben Kidd, William Shakespeare’s only son, 11-year-old Hamnet (Ollie West), never understood his father’s work. He died before he ever got the chance to. What he does understand is this: William is an absentee father, preoccupied with his own greatness. Stripped of complex language and any inkling of plot, “Hamnet” reduces the Shakespearean canon to a moving meditation on parent-child relationships. The result is a wonderfully accessible performance that is nonetheless quite nuanced.
Moukarzel and Kidd of the Dead Centre theater company of Ireland debuted “Hamnet” in Schaubühne, Berlin, in 2017, and it has since been performed in Holland, Dublin, London, Brisbane — and, most recently, Boston. From Sept. 20 to Oct. 7, ArtsEmerson is hosting the play at the Paramount Center’s Robert J. Orchard Stage. The hour-long performance is a one-man, one-child act, featuring intimate monologues by Hamnet, who doubts his own worth. “You have to be a great man to meet a great man,” he says. The boy is dressed as a contemporary 11-year-old, with black Converse, a blue hoodie, and an iPhone. He is the epitome of pre-teen candor and angst: an honest portrait of a hurt yet devoted son.
Later in the performance, his long-lost father returns. William Shakespeare (Moukarzel) does not appear in-person. Behind the stage is a screen on which Moukarzel is projected: pacing, grieving, and talking — finally — to his dead son. This unique multimedia set allows West and Moukarzel to enact an uncanny reunion of conversation and ghostly absence. The barrier of time is impenetrable, as Moukarzel is confined to the screen.
Each blames the other for haunting him. Each misunderstands the other: Hamnet doesn’t understand his father’s language (“What the hell is a malefaction?”), and Shakespeare doesn’t understand his son’s questioning attitude.  This conflict highlights the tension between youth and age, another recurrent theme.
ArtsEmerson’s Director of Artistic Programs David Dower values the attention paid to both perspectives, noting that stories of parents and children are often universal, bridging all demographics and experiences. However, the production does not weigh the father’s and his son’s perspectives equally. West is simply too affable a kid for the focus to be anywhere but on him. He opens the play, chats up the audience, and allows himself to be vulnerable —  all before his dad finally shows up. Moukarzel, by contrast, uses a hard, fatherly tone — and, of course, is isolated within the screen. This distances the audience from his character, which makes it more difficult to connect with him. At its essence, the play is formed through the child’s eyes.
This is one of “Hamnet”’s  greatest charms and greatest complicators. Though minimalistic, the quippy performance brims with philosophy, pedagogy, and ample room for interpretation as West reminds us what it’s like to be 11.

Before it was even released, “The Dragon Prince” had a nearly unbearable burden of promise. One of the creators of this new Netflix show is Aaron Ehasz, whose television pedigree is tough to beat. He had a hand in “Futurama,” but more impressively helped produce, write, and direct the classic, beloved show “Avatar: The Last Airbender.” Both of these animated and family-friendly shows successfully achieve an impressive amount of emotional and philosophical depth and character complexity, a feat that Ehasz and his co-creator, Justin Richmond, have clearly tried to emulate in “The Dragon Prince.”
Certainly, the plot of “The Dragon Prince” will feel familiar to any fans of “Avatar” — a small band of young adults from different backgrounds embark on a quest to restore peace to their magical world. The four elements of the earlier show have been bumped up to six original sources of magic, one of a number of superficial differences between the two shows. “The Dragon Prince” is no mere clone, but it shares much of its DNA with Ehasz’s previous work.
The show takes place in a sword-and-sorcery, European-style fantasy realm. But encouragingly, the more familiar (to American audiences) milieu does not reflect a decrease in the show’s commitment to representation of diversity. “Avatar” had an impressive amount of diversity on several axes —at least in terms of representation on screen, less so in regards to voice actors — and “The Dragon Prince” has continued that trend, perhaps most notably by featuring a deaf woman (who speaks in American Sign Language) as a powerful military commander.
“The Dragon Prince” generally lives up to the high expectations set by its creator’s past work, although it has yet to match the magic of “Avatar.” Perhaps this is because the first season, at a mere nine episodes, covers much less ground than do the 20 episodes of the first season of “Avatar,” making it hard to get invested in the characters as of yet. The core protagonists — princely step-brothers Callum (Jack De Sena) and Ezran (Sasha Rojen), and their elfin companion Rayla (Paula Burrows) — have only just begun their journey by the end of the season. Season One does much more to establish mysteries than resolve them, or even give any hint as to when they will be resolved. As with jokes, it is hard to judge a television show by the set-up alone.
The content of “The Dragon Prince” is always at least decent, and is genuinely good for the most part: Jokes land, characters are developed well, and the plot moves in twists and turns that generally avoid unnecessary clichées. Unfortunately, the biggest problem the show runs into is its animation style. It is 3-D computer-animated, and the show often uses flashy modern animation techniques that mimic camera movements and depth of field. At the same time, however, the animation is clearly trying to recall classic, 2-D animation styles, to the point that frame rate is low enough to be visible.
The decision to artificially lower the frame rate is mind-boggling. Frame rates in animation have been high enough to be smooth for a long time now, and whatever pretensions towards a play for nostalgia the animators may have had, the camera and 3-D tricks they have employed — which are distracting enough on their own — prevent the show from ever feeling like a throwback. What is especially frustrating is how good the art is in “The Dragon Prince” — many individual elements are simply gorgeous — but as soon as they are animated, they become impossible to appreciate. Over time, it will be possible to adjust, but the frame rate is an unreasonably high barrier to entry for a show that has every sign of being at the very least a delightful show, if not, in time, a classic.
Fans of “Avatar” will find a welcome home in Xadia, the land of “The Dragon Prince.” The humanist philosophy and unique blend of idealism with the true complexities of politics and morality will feel as comfortable and familiar as the brave young protagonist who relies more on his heart and his mind than his martial prowess. If Ehasz and Richmond can stick the landing of their intriguing start, then “The Dragon Prince” will be a quality show. At the same time, however, it must contend with the animation issues and the fact that the creators of “Avatar” recently announced they’ll be heading up Netflix’s live-action remake of the show. Given that, “The Dragon Prince” will struggle to find the cult of adoration that still surrounds “Avatar” a decade after the show ended.

“No one ever tells you when your mom dies, you get a free churro.”
Unfortunately, in the world of “Bojack Horseman,” centered around the titular anthropomorphized horse and ’90s sitcom star (voiced by Will Arnett), a free churro is never just a free churro. It can symbolize the simplicity of basic kindness, or the pain of a lifelong relationship devoid of it, or the bizarre human need to compensate for our discomfort with the grief of others. Or, of course, it can be all of them at once, before returning with mock seriousness to being “just a churro” in some moody, self-effacing final monologue.
Thankfully, if “Bojack Horseman” knows how to do anything, it is balance its incongruities. More than any of its predecessors, its fifth season nails a mixture of twisted realism and unpredictable comedy to take Bojack’s spiraling life down a path that is harsh but deeply satisfying. Bojack has spent the majority of the show hovering on the brink of the unforgivable. This time, he will finally cross the line.
The season opens on a deceptively positive note, with Bojack in the middle of shooting a promising new TV show and in a pseudo-relationship with his tough-girl co-star Gina (Stephanie Beatriz). After Bojack’s turn as a movie star in the self-referential "The Secretariat Story,” it’s hard to see how another “Bojack plays himself” storyline could differentiate itself from its predecessor. But this time, “Philbert the troubled detective” (the character’s literal epithet), isn’t likeably vulnerable, but a tortured, self-indulgent, glaringly obvious glamorization of male violence.
It would have been enough for “Bojack” to rest on the accomplishment of having created a humanoid cartoon horse that captures the complexities of chronic depression in a way that has resonated with so many different kinds of people. It would have been enough for it to continue churning out moments of pure animated genius, like the entire episode it devoted to the combination eulogy and stand up comedy routine that was Bojack’s mom’s funeral.
But in this season, the show goes farther than that, determined to reckon with the problems Bojack the character, and “Bojack,” the show itself, have created. It highlights the toxicity of its own inevitable glamorization of Bojack’s lifestyle (and depression in general), and the way that tortured antiheroes can cause irreparable damage to those around them that the can’t make up for by how smart or complicated they are. It critiques our cultural obsession with the same “thoughtful” pessimism it has always thrived on through weirdly positive characters like Bojack’s roommate Todd (Aaron Paul) and co-star Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul Tompkins) that we are, perhaps begrudgingly at first, forced to see value in. And, most poignantly, it demonstrates that the toxic masculinity of a liberal, witty, Hollywood asshole is not so different from that of anyone else.
“Bojack” hasn’t shied away from talking about Hollywood sexism in the past, but this season’s clear parallels to the Time’s Up movement feel tangibly heavier. Sure, one of its storylines may revolve around a hilarious sex robot — a Todd scheme that feels perfectly positioned in the space between the ridiculous humor of the early seasons and the gravity of Todd’s new, more complicated understanding of his identity as asexual. But as the season unfolds, it’s not just Todd’s sex robot becoming the CEO of a major company, or Bojack’s misogynistic, Scandinavian-hating co-star getting a “We Forgive You” award that we have to worry about. Rather, it’s the underlying sexism and violence in Bojack himself.
So what does it take to finally bring down a character as reckless, self-absorbed and continuously forgiven as Bojack Horseman? The show deserves props for using its excellent cast of female characters to give Bojack’s ugly side the reckoning it deserves. In a TV landscape where shows still struggle to barely pass the Bechdel test, it is thrilling to see how well the show fleshes out the individual ways Bojack’s manager Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris), ex-publicist Ana (Angela Basset), and ghostwriter Diane (Alison Brie) process and draw attention to Bojack’s unforgivable actions and the general misogyny around them. Whether they choose to distance themselves from Bojack at the cost of their own success, or let him off the hook yet again and live with the consequences, each woman’s story reveals a facet of Hollywood sexism’s human cost.
Despite a few moments when it tried to give its women “backstory” (for Princess Carolyn in particular) that felt a bit out of left field, the majority of the season was marked by standout moments of growth and development for these female characters. In particular, key conversations between Princess Carolyn and Diane — whose respective ends-justify-the-means morality and feminist self-righteousness play off each other so well — and Diane and Ana, serve to highlight not only the cleverness of the show, but the legitimacy of its claim to care about women. It is when we are listening to Hollywood sexism not solely filtered through “a Ryan Seacrest type,” but rather through the eyes of a violently optimistic North Carolina career woman and the equally interesting Buzzfeed feminist she’s supposed to hate, that the show reminds you what “feminism” is really about — the validation of women’s voices, no litmus test necessary.
In the midst of the amplification of the stories of all of these interesting, fleshed-out female characters, “Bojack” also knows when to return to its signature wise, oscillating, self-deprecating Diane. Season Five Diane was far from perfect — there were moments when she wandered so deep into a fruitless, myopic sense of self-pity that it was hard to reconcile this jaded divorcee blogger in a pixie-cut with the kind, nervous idealist of Season One. But in the show’s searing final moments, when the old Diane that still hadn’t quite given up on the world — or on Bojack — returned, it was all the more powerful. From the first episode, the question of whether Bojack could ever be saved has grown louder and louder, each new failure raising the stakes for some earth-shattering low or entirely unpredictable solution. But the end of Season Five, wisely, chooses to revel in the simple, sacred, mystifying connection it has created between two broken people, a choice that feels deeply satisfying.
Since the show’s beginning, Diane has been the only voice of hope that Bojack really listens to, and it was her phone call that pulled him back from the edge of giving up at the end of Season Two. And so, fittingly, it’s her voice when he needs it the most that gets Bojack to say the three little words it may have seemed this bitter, self-deluding addict was incapable of: “I need help.”
“Bojack” has chosen at last not to wallow in its own misery. Those three words were the conclusion this poignant, satisfying season deserved.

This is a Game-changer.
In an email to the student body, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair reported that the Athletics Department is instituting new rules for obtaining tickets to the anticipated Harvard-Yale football game — known by fans as “The Game.” While undergraduates still get one free ticket, this year The Game will be played at Fenway Park. As a result of Fenway policies, there will now be assigned seating. In addition to this drastic change, students must now go across the river to pick up tickets from the Athletics Box Office until two days before the pick-up period is over, when they will be available at the Smith Campus Center. Most students who spoke to The Crimson have been dissatisfied with the changes, and so are we.
The fundamental reason many students go to the Harvard-Yale is not to watch football. Rather, it is to relax with friends, mingle, and celebrate the coming Thanksgiving Break and end of semester. This universally festive atmosphere makes The Game a great social equalizer and inclusive social space — something that the College is often sorely lacking. We are thus disappointed that the changes implemented by Fenway Park and the University will make it challenging for students to sit with their friends, and that so much confusion has been added to what should be a straightforward process.
Harvard students wanting to sit together with friends are now forced to coordinate a time and date to make the trip to the Smith Campus Center or the Murr Center together to pick up the tickets, something highly difficult to coordinate given varying course and extracurricular schedules. Additionally, Harvard-Yale is almost definitionally a time for students to mingle with Yalies and students from other universities — a prospect which these new policies have all but done away with.
To add to the logistical confusion, that there are only two locations on the entirety of Harvard’s campus (one of which is only offering tickets for two days) makes picking up tickets far more difficult logistically. Moreover, for the vast majority of the period in which students can pick up tickets, doing so will require an unnecessarily long commute. This could easily be fixed by distributing tickets in more centralized locations such as the Smith Campus Center or house dining halls.
In previous years, Harvard has provided a guest ticket program for its students, which allowed students to purchase extra tickets for $55 to $75. With the new change in venue, the guest ticket program has been discarded so that students can only purchase tickets directly through the Athletics Box Office. Yet tickets for the game have been on sale since April and are now sold out. Students interested in bringing guests are forced to look to other online ticket exchange sites, where tickets are being resold for up to $300.
On top of all of this, transportation to the game is sure to be a logistical nightmare. With the game all the way at Fenway, students may have to catch the T or use a ride-sharing app to get there, whereas before they could have just as easily walked a couple of blocks to Harvard Stadium. We anticipate that Uber and Lyft will be flooded with ride requests, driving up prices and causing massive delays. The distance not only proves to be an inconvenience, but also a major safety issue as students who consume alcohol before the event will now be forced to make the long journey to Fenway. Even if the University provides buses, organizing such transport is sure to be difficult and costly.
Our safety concerns do not end there. Since The Game is not on campus, students are more likely to be intoxicated in presence of Boston police. The College has not yet clarified how its amnesty policy applies at The Game, and how to avoid risky scenarios where intoxicated students come into contact with Boston Police Department. Harvard should address this risk immediately.
These issues are serious ones, and to resolve them will require extensive prior planning. We urge Harvard to take action to ensure that The Game remains a source of stress relief, rather than additional headaches.
Clarification: Sept. 27, 2018
A previous version of this editorial stated that the University is implementing assigned seating for The Game. To clarify, the University is complying with Fenway Park's enforcement of designated seating.

It was wrong when the Republican Congress called for it and President Donald Trump signed it into law. It’s wrong now.
Recently, Democratic nominee for Massachusetts governor Jay Gonzalez, with Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor Quentin A. Palfrey ’96 and Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern beside him, announced a plan to tax the endowments of the state’s private, non-profit colleges and universities whose endowments total over $1 billion at a 1.6 percent rate. This plan is more severe than the one passed by Republicans in Congress and signed into law by Trump. That plan taxed the income generated by university endowments, meaning that, according to one estimate, Harvard will have to pay the federal government over $40 million. Gonzalez’s plan, on the other hand, taxes the assets of the endowments, resulting in the $500 million figure that Harvard would owe the state of Massachusetts under his plan.
Simply put, this plan is foolish. All of the institutions of higher education that would be taxed under this plan — including Harvard — are non-profit organizations. In case Gonzalez has forgotten what that means, these institutions don’t make money off of the services they provide the public or the people they educate. At the same time, they provide an enormous benefit to society. Higher education has been shown to increase social mobility, civic engagement, tax revenues, economic growth, innovation, and has many more positive effects.
Supporters of the plan delineate the difference between this plan and the one passed by Republicans in Washington by pointing to Gonzalez’s intention to use the income generated by the tax to fund public education and transportation. Besides the fact that Gonzalez avowedly does not yet know how the money “would be allocated,” raiding one form of non-profit education to provide for another is hypocritical at best. There is no doubt that public education deserves more money than it is currently receiving, but the money should come from elsewhere.
In the same vein, raiding one public benefit (like higher education) to give to another (like transportation) is often a very bad idea. Of course, governments must sometimes fund initiatives with less-than-ideal revenue sources. Budget constraints are real. But stealing large sums of money (such as $500 million) from a public good can lead to unintended consequences down the road. As an example, for years, New York governors used money that was originally meant for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for other projects. Now, the New York City subway system is in shambles.
Still others argue that endowment taxes encourage universities to use their endowments to lower tuition prices and increase financial aid for their students. Many of the universities affected by this tax, however, already have need-blind admissions processes, meaning your socioeconomic status plays no role in the decision of whether to admit you. However, even if this weren’t true, it’s difficult to lower the price of tuition or provide more financial aid when the state of Massachusetts is stealing away significant amounts of money from your budget. The way to incentivize universities to lower their prices certainly isn’t to tax them. Indeed, it may trigger the opposite of what was intended.
Moreover (and perhaps worst of all), Gonzalez’s plan dangerously plays into the populist attack on higher education, and it reaffirms the idea that higher education is an elitist institution that is bad for the nation, rather than an instigator of social mobility and societal progress.
So, Mr. Gonzalez, tell me this:
How many life-saving initiatives will go unfunded? How many policymakers won’t be informed? How many people won’t receive financial aid? How many people won’t be accepted for science-advancing and potentially life-saving clinical trials because you decided to latch onto a dangerous political fad?
Neither you nor I can answer these questions precisely — we don’t know how Harvard will deal with the lost revenue, just like you have no real plan for how to spend it. But what we both know is that the $500 million in cuts have to come from somewhere. The University’s surplus on its $5 billion operating budget only amounted to $114 million in the 2017 fiscal year. Taking into account the $40 million that will be lost to the federal endowment tax, that leaves an almost $400 million hole in the University’s budget. This isn’t just another endowment tax. This is a tax on financial aid. This is a tax on education. This is a tax on research. But perhaps most disgustingly, this is a tax on human lives and progress.
Some argue that the endowment tax is a slippery slope — that it paves the way for the taxation of other non-profits. That both the national endowment tax and this proposal will lead to the taxation of other non-profits is undoubtedly true, but this isn’t a slippery slope.
Because, with Gonzalez’s proposal, we’re already at the bottom.

Can college be a home? We often jump to thinking about ways to make college more of a home for students. But let’s not put the cart before the horse. This question hinges on what the definition of “home” should be, which can and does vary widely.
I first began thinking about this as a high school student, imagining what college would be. In 2015, a year of protests at many universities, one exchange at Yale University stood out to me. Student protesters were confronting Nicholas Christakis, then a master of one of Yale’s residential colleges, mainly in response to a controversial email about toleration of possibly offensive Halloween costumes, sent by his wife and fellow master.
The conflict stemmed from differing points of view on what kind of community should be fostered at Yale’s residential colleges. One student protester argued, “It is not about creating an intellectual space! It’s about creating a home here.” She got more agitated as Christakis refused to accept the same assumption.
In the discourse following the protests, others posited that college could not be a home. Professor Alan Jacobs of Baylor University, for example, wrote that a residential college is “a place where people from all over the world … come to live together temporarily ... It is an essentially public space.” A writer in the Atlantic argued, “Homes are typically places where parents instill their own values in kids whose formative experiences they shape ... Insofar as [college] includes students from diverse homes, it will be unlike an actual home.”
I remember these unconventional opinions because they were quite scary. As a high school student, I didn’t want to imagine college as a place that I wouldn’t be able to call home. But I found these arguments persuasive, in theory at least.
By negating the arguments above, home is a permanent, private, and undiverse place. A safe space, if you will. I am fortunate that I can describe my home that way. At home, I can do essentially whatever I want, knowing that I have the unconditional love of my parents. They would attest to how difficult I can be to live with. At home, even though we can disagree, the range of intellectual debate is rather limited. That is because of the lack of diversity. When it comes down to it, my parents look similar to me, lead relatively similar lives to me, and have imparted values to me that I still, for the most part, agree with.
How, then, could college be like home? Indeed, having gained enough experience so that I no longer merely imagine but can reflect, it is not.
College is not this comfortable because, obviously, it does not give its students unconditional leeway. At Convocations, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana says once you are admitted, you do not have to jump through more hoops; you can do what you want. But that refers to academics and extracurricular activities. When it comes to social life, you can’t do whatever you want. You have to be a good roommate, a good friend. You have to earn the respect and love of your peers.
College is not about me, you, or the individual. It is hard to let down one’s guard the way one can do at home, mainly because of the lingering awareness that the dorm is only a temporary living situation. So I don’t walk around barefoot, or leave my stuff lying around, or decorate the walls. I don’t know most people who live here and thus don’t get past the polite pleasantries that I can skip at home.
College is also not as comfortable as home precisely because of the diversity of people — though that is not a bad thing. The point of going to college, and in particular living at one away from home, is to leave the nest and grow up. To see what, and who, lies outside.
That is why, even though I do not really consider college a home, life is far from bleak. In fact, I don’t want college to be more like my home. That place — a sheltered escape from the outside world —  is more accurately now my childhood home. And I should not be a child anymore.

Several Harvard Law School professors said they were troubled by the sexual assault allegations recently levelled against Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh and called for further investigation into his alleged misbehavior.
When President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July to fill Anthony M. Kennedy’s seat, many thought the conservative judge would sail through the confirmation process despite unified opposition from Senate Democrats. But all that changed after at least two women publicly alleged over the past two weeks that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted them decades ago.
Kavanaugh has taught as a lecturer at the Law School since 2008, and a number of professors and Law School Dean John F. Manning lauded him in the days after Trump announced his nomination. In the wake of the assault allegations, though, some of Kavanaugh's colleagues at the school have joined a growing chorus calling for a serious investigation into the allegations — and for senators to vote against Kavanaugh if the women's stories are true.
Law School Professor Michael J. Klarman, a constitutional law scholar, wrote in an email Sunday that, while some have argued that Kavanaugh’s actions as a 17-year-old are not relevant to the judge's ability to serve on the Court, he does not buy that reasoning.
“I certainly agree with the idea that we should be pretty forgiving toward youthful mistakes.  But attempted rape is a really serious charge. And serving on the Supreme Court is a privilege, not a right,” Klarman wrote. “So my view, though I think reasonable people can differ on this, is that if he committed the assault, as alleged, his confirmation should be rejected.”
Kavanaugh’s first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, came forward almost two weeks ago after an anonymous letter she sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) detailing her allegations over the summer was leaked to the press. In an interview with the Washington Post, Ford said that Kavanaugh forced her onto a bed, pressed his body to hers, and attempted to remove her clothes while both were attending a house party in 1982.
Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh’s second accuser, came forward a few days later. Ramirez told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself and pushed his penis in her face at a party held in a dorm room when both were freshmen at Yale.
Ford and Kavanaugh are both set to testify Thursday in a nationally broadcasted hearing; the Senate Judiciary Committee will then vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation Friday. Ramirez has not been called to testify. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied both women’s allegations, and Trump has said he will stand behind his nominee.
Law Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 took his views on the Kavanaugh confirmation process to Twitter Monday.
“Closing ranks around Kavanaugh even before Dr.Blasey Ford testifies is proof positive that these Trumpsters either (1) don’t regard an attempted rape and a nominee’s false denials as relevant and/or (2) are ready to disbelieve her without listening,” Tribe wrote.
Tribe expanded on his thoughts in an email to The Crimson.
“Either branch of that dilemma reveals an ugly truth about the premises of the pro-Kavanaugh line of defense," he wrote. "I began as someone who personally liked and professionally admired Brett Kavanaugh despite our many legal and philosophical disagreements. At this point I’m deeply troubled by the way he has let himself become a battering ram against the women who have had the courage to say what they recall him doing to them."
Klarman agreed, arguing that the Republicans are not taking the investigation of the women’s claims seriously and that the Senate Judiciary Committee must gather more evidence. Ford previously requested an FBI investigation into her allegation, but the Senate committee denied the request.
“It is hard to understand how Republicans can justify not conducting a more thorough investigation than it appears they will do,” Klarman wrote. “But I suppose that, given their willingness  to ‘steal’ a Supreme Court seat from President Obama (the Garland seat), we shouldn't be surprised that they would countenance extraordinary departures from procedural regularity to see the solid conservative majority on the Supreme Court that they have dreamed of for generations.”
Law Professor Elizabeth Bartholet ’62 wrote via email that the Thursday hearings should be postponed pending an investigation.
“I don’t know what effect the allegations will have. I believe they should have the effect of persuading the Committee majority and the Senate as a whole to postpone the hearings pending a full and fair investigation of the allegations,” she wrote.
Five other Harvard Law professors contacted by The Crimson declined to comment on Kavanaugh.
In the wake of the allegations, students at the Law school have protested his nomination. On Monday, several hundred Harvard affiliates walked out of class to stand in solidarity with Ford and Ramirez. Many of the protesters donned bright pink “I Believe Christine Blasey Ford” pins.
Four students earlier authored a Harvard Law Record article calling on the University to bar Kavanaugh from teaching until a "full and fair investigation" is conducted into the sexual misconduct allegations against him. Kavanaugh is slated to teach a course titled “The Supreme Court Since 2005” during the Law School's 2019 winter term, which takes place over three weeks in January.
Law School administrators have repeatedly refused to say whether they still plan to allow Kavanaugh to teach the class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of “intense” negotiations with Harvard, leaders of Harvard’s largest labor union say it is unlikely that they will reach an agreement before members’ current contract expires.
The union — Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers — represents around 5,100 Harvard employees working in libraries, labs, and faculty offices, among other roles. The union’s current contract is set to expire on Sept. 30, and the new agreement, when reached, will be binding for the next three years.
Even though it looks as if the parties will not reach an agreement by Sept. 30, University spokesperson Melodie Jackson said University representatives were pleased with the bargaining process so far. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement that they believe the past several months have yielded “positive and constructive progress.”
“Members of the HUCTW are highly-regarded members of the University workforce and we are putting forward proposals that reflect that,” Jackson wrote. “The University remains committed to negotiations that will ultimately result in a contract that ensures HUCTW members salary and range of benefits remain at the top of market, when compared to other Boston-area higher education institutions.”
The last time the University and HUCTW negotiated a contract was in 2015. During those negotiations, bargaining continued for nearly four months after the expiration of the union’s previous contract.
HUCTW president Carrie Barbash said the University and the union have an existing arrangement to keep members’ benefits in place in the absence of a contract. The lack of a resolution will delay any expected raises that the new contract will bring for members, however.
“There's no way that people can actually, at this late date, have their wages in their pockets on Oct. 1,” Barbash said. “But it is still possible we could reach agreement by Oct. 1.”
“Even if we agreed today, there's a lot of processing that has to happen,” she added.
But Jackson said the contract expiring before a new one was in place should not cause alarm. “It is not unusual for negotiations to extend beyond the expiration of a contract and we are committed to continuing to work in partnership with HUCTW toward a speedy resolution,” she wrote.
Representatives from the University and the union first met each other at the bargaining table informally in Dec. 2017, and the two sides began concrete, issue-based negotiations in the spring. Since then, the two sides have held bargaining sessions “virtually every week, often multiple times a week,” according to an email sent to union members Monday afternoon.
In that email, union leaders characterized the negotiations as “respectful and constructive” but also “intense and frustrating.” About a month ago, both sides agreed to initiate the use of two predetermined third-party mediators, Barbash said.
The mediators — Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economics professor, and Robert B. McKersie, professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School of Management — have previously played a role in HUCTW bargaining, mediating for negotiations in both 2013 and 2015. Barbash said their primary role in negotiations is to consult with University and union bargaining teams, both separately and together, and come up with creative “win-win” solutions.
HUCTW’s Monday email to union members delineated three “most critical” topics of debate in the bargaining sessions: salary increases, healthcare benefits, and the use of contingent workers. As of now, HUCTW leaders feel the union and the University are “too far apart on” all three of these issues to conclude negotiations before the Sept. 30 deadline.
Barbash declined to comment on the specific salary proposals that have been made. She did say, though, that the union’s bargaining committee is “looking for raises that allow members to keep up with inflation and make a little progress on top of that.”
The union is also at odds with University representatives over healthcare — a divisive issue during the union’s last negotiations in 2015. Specifically, HUCTW leaders wrote in the email that there is a “substantial distance” between the University and the union over how different levels of healthcare premiums should be adjusted to keep pace with rising costs, inflation, and wages.
The University and the union are also divided over how to classify contingent workers — temps and workers who are employed less than 17.5 hours per week.
In many cases, Barbash said, these workers are hired in accordance with HUCTW’s current contract policy, which states that temporary employees can only be hired for a maximum of three months.
Other times, however, the employees are kept in temporary positions for extended periods of time without being granted the status of full employees. This prevents them from joining the union and receiving benefits, a situation that worries Barbash and the union negotiators.
“We're concerned that there's people who should really be in the union with union protections, union benefits, Harvard benefits, and it really feels like they're not getting a fair deal,” Barbash said. “If you're in one of these temporary, precarious positions for years and years and years, that doesn't seem to really be meeting the spirit of the agreement that says… the use of these [temporary positions] is supposed to be strictly limited.”
“The gist of the whole thing is if you're doing HUCTW work, you should be in a HUCTW job,” she added.
The continuation of talks past September means that HUCTW’s negotiations may overlap with the first contract negotiations of Harvard’s newly-formed students union, Harvard Graduate Students Union - United Automobile Workers. HGSU-UAW leaders have said they expect to begin bargaining with the University this semester.
Ultimately, Barbash said negotiations remain productive, and she is hopeful that they will be resolved soon.
“Both parties are making a good faith effort to try and resolve of the contract as soon as possible,” Barbash said. “I think we're just maybe not seeing eye to eye on certain issues, but I feel like everyone is engaging in a productive way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brian K. Lee will be Harvard’s next Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development, the University announced Monday, just days after it released the final total of its record-breaking $9.6 billion capital campaign.
Lee currently works at the California Institute of Technology, where he is overseeing the school’s own $2 billion capital campaign. University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who took office this summer, appointed him to the Harvard post. Lee and Bacow aren't new acquaintances; prior to his current role at Caltech, Lee spent 26 years in various roles at Tufts University, including many years working under Bacow, who served as president of Tufts until 2011.
Lee will take over from the current vice president, Tamara E. Rogers ’74, in November. Rogers has held the role since 2007, and she announced her plans last winter to step down by the end of the calendar year. She oversaw the capital campaign from its launch in 2013.
Lee told the Harvard Gazette that he was looking forward to serving the school and its alumni.
“I am thrilled at the prospect of working with Harvard’s remarkable community of alumni, donors, and volunteers,” Lee said. “This is an exciting time to build on the strong engagement and momentum of a campaign with far-reaching impact.”
In his new role, Lee will lead the University's fundraising and alumni outreach initiatives. His appointment comes on the heels of Harvard completing the largest campaign in higher education history, sailing past the University’s original goal of $6.5 billion to raise $3.1 billion more.
But Lee will also step into his new job as the school prepares to face an unprecedented tax on its endowment and must continue to fund a number of large ongoing projects like a new Allston campus and undergraduate House renewal.
Bacow told the Gazette he looks forward to working with Lee in his new role.
“Brian has demonstrated an extraordinary ability to bring together people in support of higher education, and he brings to his new role an especially strong record of supporting and advancing institutional goals with a combination of creativity, insight, and thoughtfulness,” he said.
A search committee chaired by Robert W. Iuliano ’83, Harvard’s general counsel, selected Lee. The existence of the group and its membership were not made public prior to the selection.
Lee will begin his role Nov. 19.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fourteen seniors were announced Monday as Senior Class Marshals for the Class of 2019.
The Marshals, who collectively make up the Senior Class Committee, are responsible for organizing class-wide events up until Commencement in May. They also coordinate the Senior Gift fund and plan post-graduation reunion events.
After a two-round election last week, Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Anant T. Pai ’19 were named First and Second Marshals, respectively.
Zhang, who is also the UC president, said her goal as First Marshal is to bring the senior class together.
“Harvard is all about the people,” Zhang said. “I want to make sure that this last year here is about the people and about creating community and really living in the moment and living presently with some of the most amazing and inspiring people that we will ever come across.”
Though still “half-asleep” when he found out he had been elected Second Marshal, Pai said he was “over-the-moon excited.”
Pai said he wanted to build community with “personal, one-on-one programming” and plan reflections for the senior class. “I’d be lying if I said Harvard has always been an easy place, so it’s exciting to engage in a series of reflective events that will get people thinking about these last three years and who they want to be when they leave,” he said.
Since senior years tend to fly by, slowing down the pace is a priority for Tyler S. LeComer ’19, one of the six elected Program Marshals. The Program Marshals are those who place third through eighth in the election process.
“It’s hard to kind of stop and slow down for a second and one, take a second to remember that this is our last year and we’re on our way out and two, everyone that we’ve known and everyone that we talk to has helped us get to this point,” LeComer said.
In addition to the eight elected marshals, six seniors were appointed gift marshals by the Harvard College Fund after an application and interview process. The gift marshals are in charge of orchestrating the Senior Gift Fund, which asks graduating seniors to donate to Harvard.
Hanna M. Glissendorf ’19, one of this year’s gift marshals, said raising money for things like financial aid will be a key focus.
“I’m just excited to try and educate the entire senior class on what senior gift is and how important it is and how great it is to start giving back to the college now,” Glissendorf said.
The full list of seniors selected as members of the Senior Class Committee is below:
First Marshal
Catherine L. Zhang ’19 (Cabot)
Second Marshal
Anant T. Pai ’19 (Adams)
Program Marshals
Cleanna M. Crabill ’19 (Adams)
Ruiqi He ’19 (Leverett)
Tyler S. LeComer ’19 (Dunster)
Alex Popovski ’19 (Dunster)
Juliana Rodriguez ’19 (Lowell)
Simi N. Shah ’19 (Currier)
Gift Marshals
Jose Avonce ’19 (Leverett)
Michael K. Bervell ’19 (Kirkland)
Hanna M. Glissendorf ’19 (Pforzheimer)
Amrita Mohanty ’19 (Cabot)
Kailash S. Sundaram ’19 (Winthrop)
Sarah S. Zia ’19 (Lowell)

Harvard’s brand-new graduate student union inched towards the bargaining table earlier this semester when it published a list of bargaining goals for its inaugural round of negotiations with administrators.
The goals — which come from a survey distributed to members this summer — address a wide set of issues, ranging from wage increases to visa protections. Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’s 13-member bargaining committee generated the 80-point list based on 1,600 responses to a survey it sent out to members this fall. The final list has nearly twice as many goals as those listed on the bargaining survey.
Before they begin pushing for a contract that reflects the goals, HGSU-UAW’s membership at large will vote on the list. Evan C. MacKay ’19, who represents undergraduates on the bargaining committee, wrote in an email that the vote will conclude “soon.” After rank-and-file sign off on the goals, negotiators say they will likely begin formal contract negotiations with Harvard before the semester is over.
Central to the union’s lengthy list of goals is the issue of compensation for student employees. Bargaining committee members hope to increase minimum pay rates, guarantee annual pay increases “that keep pace with local cost-of-living,” and streamline the payroll process, among other topics.
Wages have served as a rallying point for graduate students arguing for the necessity of a union. In 2017, as the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences faced financial pressure, Harvard announced lower-than-usual increases to Ph.D. students’ stipends coupled with normal increases to housing fees.
Though stipend increases have since returned to normal rates, HGSU-UAW organizers argued that the union could secure greater stipend and housing stability from year to year. The slate of bargaining goals includes several aimed at regulating the University’s financial support for students.
Most notably, the union proposes that the University waive all tuition and fees for teaching and research assistants. While doctoral degree students at GSAS are all guaranteed tuition deductions through grants from the University, students in masters’ programs and at other Harvard schools may not have the same level of support.
Former NLRB chairman William B. Gould IV said the proposal to waive tuition was “very ambitious.”
“We're really at the beginning of graduate student negotiations in the private sector, and in the private sector, tuition is going to be more considerable, fees are going to be more considerable, than at state universities,” Gould said. “So it's a bold proposal, but it's certainly relevant to their situation.”
Regardless of whether they receive University stipends, any graduate student has the option to apply for University-owned housing. Union negotiators plan to call for rent reductions overall, as well as changes to the way rent increases are set year-to-year.
Currently, an external contractor analyzes sources such as off-campus rentals provided by Harvard University Housing and non-Harvard rental websites in order to gauge prices at competing apartment complexes in Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville. The contractor then generates rent levels for the approximately 3,000 University-owned apartments.
In addition to compensation and housing, the union’s bargaining committee also plans to advocate for the institution of a sizable number of health benefits for teaching and research assistants. These include paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for all student employees and their dependents; an expanded list of covered medications; and a guarantee that University Health Services responds to “health and mental health emergencies, without unnecessarily turning to law enforcement.”
Union membership includes both undergraduate and graduate teaching and research assistants. The goals include several items aimed at regulating students’ workloads, both in the lab and the classroom. HGSU-UAW plans to call for increased regulation of job postings, hours, and payroll.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is currently mulling proposals to end “shopping week,” a one-week period at the beginning of the semester when students can walk in and out of classes before officially enrolling.
In past semesters, shopping week has created headaches for graduate students seeking to secure teaching positions, since College classes add and drop teaching fellows based on fluctuating class sizes. Though many of the goals suggest streamlining this process, MacKay wrote that HGSU-UAW has no official position on shopping week.
Bargaining committee members also plan to push for paid leave, lowered childcare costs, retirement benefits, and increased control over professional development trainings.
Once they begin negotiations, the bargaining committee will also seek contract measures addressing students’ life outside research and teaching obligations. Much of HGSU-UAW’s work over the past several months has concerned issues of diversity, international student protections, and sexual harassment.
This second set of goals relates to the work of several of HGSU-UAW’s subcommittees, including the “Time’s Up” committee, Civil and Human Rights committee, and International Student Working Group.
Per the bargaining goals, the union will seek to “establish the right to expedited, neutral and procedurally fair, third-party grievance procedure for discrimination, harassment, and other complaints.” MacKay wrote that the United Automobile Workers will likely be a party in any outside grievance procedures, though he added that the details of those procedures would also be a part of negotiations with administrators.
“Based on the experience at other universities, most grievances get resolved quickly and informally,” he wrote. “If a grievance goes all the way to arbitration, it is likely that a UAW representative would help do the arbitration hearing and arguments.”
The bargaining committee also proposed several protections for international students in the bargaining unit. In doing so, committee members drew from the work of one of its longest-standing branches, the International Scholars Working Group.
The ISWG began advocating for international grad students even before HGSU-UAW was formally authorized. After a travel ban placed on certain countries prevented several Harvard affiliates from entering the United States in Jan. 2017, the group advocated for the creation of a hotline to advise students affected by the policy.
Among other things, the bargaining committee aims to provide free legal assistance to international student employees with visa and immigration issues; guarantee access to free English language classes; and protect the benefits and pay of student employees who “encounter visa problems or are targeted by discriminatory state or federal policies.”
If they are included in the contract between HGSU-UAW and Harvard, the final set of goals would further establish the union’s presence on campus. For example, HGSU-UAW would gain access to University facilities and union representatives would be compensated for their time doing union-related advocacy.
Ultimately, MacKay said the overarching objective of the bargaining goals is to “improve economic and other conditions” for student employees and “make Harvard a more accessible and inclusive community.”
“The purpose is to improve the experiences of all student workers, understanding that each student worker has different working conditions,” MacKay said. “Some goals might not apply to all student workers, but each student worker in our diverse community will see benefits in our final contract.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School is refusing to say whether it will allow conservative judge and Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh to return to Cambridge to teach the course on the Court he is slated to offer Law students in Jan. 2019.
The school’s silence comes as students on campus are increasingly calling for decisive action to address allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted at least two women.
Last week, four Law School students demanded in a Harvard Law Record article that the school bar Kavanaugh from teaching until “a full and fair investigation is conducted” into the allegations of sexual misconduct. On Monday, several hundred Harvard affiliates walked out of class to rally in support of the two women who have accused Kavanaugh of misbehavior.
The Crimson contacted Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 three times over the past week to ask whether Harvard will permit Kavanaugh, who serves as a Law School lecturer, to teach this winter. In response, school spokespeople once did not respond and twice declined to comment.
“It is our longstanding policy not to comment publicly on personnel matters,” Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in a statement Tuesday.
As of Tuesday evening, a Harvard website still listed Kavanaugh as the “Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law” and indicated he will be teaching the course “The Supreme Court Since 2005” in Jan. 2019. Kavanaugh has taught at the Law School since 2008.
President Donald Trump in July named Kavanaugh his nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Justice Anthony Kennedy. The judge seemed a surefire bet until two weeks ago, when women began to come forward with allegations that he had sexually assaulted them at parties held decades ago.
First, Palo Alto psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh had forced her onto a bed, pressed his body to hers, and tried to take off her clothes at a party the two attended in the 1980s, when both were enrolled in private D.C.-area high schools.
Just a few days later, another woman — Deborah Ramirez — told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had exposed himself and pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended while freshmen at Yale College.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly and unequivocally denied the allegations.
Both Kavanaugh and Ford are set to testify at a high-stakes and nationally televised hearing before members of the Senate on Thursday at 10 a.m. The Law School has said it will provide space on campus for students to watch the hearing.
At first, Kavanaugh’s nomination seemed to please the Law School’s top brass. Shortly after Trump announced Kavanaugh was his pick, Manning lauded and congratulated the judge in a statement posted to a Law School website.
“I congratulate Judge Kavanaugh on his nomination to the Supreme Court and thank him for his superb teaching at Harvard Law School over the past decade,” Manning said in the post. “Let me take this occasion to thank Judge Kavanaugh for the generosity, dedication, and collegiality he has shown our community.”
More recently, Manning has stayed quiet. He has not commented on Kavanaugh at least since Ford publicly detailed the nominee’s alleged sexual misconduct for the first time on Sept. 16.
As his public silence stretches on, some Law School students are privately contacting the dean to seek answers.
Alexandra “Vail” Kohnert-Yount, one of the authors of the Harvard Law Record article who helped organize Monday’s walkout and rally, said that several students have reached out to Manning regarding Kavanaugh — and at least some of them have asked whether the Law School will allow Kavanaugh to continue teaching. Kohnert-Yount said she has not individually contacted Manning.
Manning has responded to at least a few of the students. In a reply email to one student obtained by The Crimson, Manning wrote that he had received “a similar expression of concern from some of your fellow students.”
He then thanked the writer for engaging with “the important and difficult issues with which our nation and its institutions are grappling.”
“I am very grateful to you for sharing with me your views and your perspective… with respect to the specific question each of you asked: For reasons I’m sure you understand, it is our longstanding policy not to discuss personnel matters,” Manning wrote, ostensibly referencing a question about Kavanaugh’s employment at Harvard. “I know that may be frustrating, but the policy serves important purposes even in challenging times.”
He added: “Please know that we take concerns about our teaching program very seriously. Again, I am grateful to you for reaching out to me.”
Members of the Senate are slated to take a final vote on Kavanaugh on Friday.

A recent multi-million dollar donation from a Harvard Business School alumnus will fund the development of case studies examining the intersections of artificial intelligence and business, the school announced Monday.
Stephen A. Schwarzman, who received his MBA from the Business School in 1972, donated $5 million to support the efforts of HBS faculty members producing case studies in the field, according to a press release.
Schwarzman is the co-founder and CEO of Blackstone, a multinational private equity, asset management, and financial services firm.
Students in the MBA program at the Business School learn using the case method, an innovative approach to learning pioneered by the Business School in the 1920s, through which students analyze, discuss, and brainstorm solutions for real-world issues in business and industry. According to the press release, the Schwarzman Research Fund will support case studies on a wide array of topics related to artificial intelligence, including the development of new markets, worker productivity, and ethical concerns.
Schwarzman said his experience heading Blackstone underscored the importance of the relationship between technology and business.
“The disruptive implications and opportunities surrounding AI are far-reaching,” he said in the press release. “Executives need to understand how to anticipate, act on, and manage these changes. I am hopeful that through these case studies— hallmarks of the HBS experience that have helped train a century of business leaders— we can better prepare the next generation to help shape the application of AI in an ethical and accountable way that benefits the public interest.”
HBS Dean Nitin Nohria said he welcomes the opportunity to expose students to a new and increasingly relevant field.
“AI has profound implications for the future of work and for society more broadly,” said Nohria. “Steve's generous gift will accelerate faculty research in this area, advancing understanding and exposing business leaders around the world to this increasingly important topic.”
Schwarzman’s donation to the Business School comes as the University completes its capital campaign, which hauled in a total of $9.6 billion dollars — an all-time high in higher education. The Business School was consistently among the top of Harvard’s professional schools in donations throughout the five year campaign.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was only one thing on the minds of the roughly 40 people who attended the Harvard College Democrats' general meeting Tuesday evening.
Four invited speakers — as well as members of the College Democrats — devoted their remarks Tuesday night to Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh and recent allegations that he sexually assaulted at least two women several decades ago.
Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s pick to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Anthony Kennedy, seemed a lock for confirmation to the Court until Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez went public in the past few weeks with allegations of sexual misconduct that date back decades. Many at the meeting Tuesday heavily criticized Harvard Law School’s silence regarding the two women’s stories.
Though the Law School’s top brass released a statement praising Kavanaugh shortly after his nomination, no administrators — including Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 — have commented on the conservative judge since Ford's allegations surfaced two weeks ago. Connie Cho, a Law School student and Cabot House tutor who helped organize a campus walkout Monday to support Ford and Ramirez, said she and her peers are disappointed by what she called the Law School’s failure to address the allegations.
“So many of us, as Law Students, saw this news and expected a response from our school,” Cho said. “There was no response.”
Kavanaugh serves as a lecturer at the Law School and is slated to teach a course there in Jan. 2019. Some students have called on Harvard to bar the nominee from teaching in Cambridge pending a “full and fair investigation” into the allegations of sexual misbehavior — Law School administrators have repeatedly refused to say whether or not they will continue to employ Kavanaugh.
“It is Law School policy not to comment on personnel matters," Law School spokesperson Robb London wrote in a statement Tuesday.
Cho began her presentation to the College Democrats by comparing the allegations against Kavanaugh to similar allegations faced by current Supreme Court Justice Clarence M. Thomas during his confirmation process in 1991.
The two men’s situations evoke parallels. During Thomas’s confirmation, Anita F. Hill, a professor of social policy, law, and women’s studies at Brandeis University, spoke out to accuse the nominee —  her former supervisor at the Department of Education — of sexually harassing her.
Cho said the United States Senate’s response to Hill’s allegations is similar to the way Congress is responding today to Ford’s and Ramirez’s allegations against Kavanaugh.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Ford, a psychologist and professor of statistics at Palo Alto University, said Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her, and tried to pull off her clothing at a party both attended in high school. In a later interview with the New Yorker, Ramirez said Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face at a party both attended while students at Yale.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly rejected the charges, calling them “false accusations.”
Cho said the reoccurrence of high-profile cases like these in the federal judiciary represents “not a bug in the system, but a feature.”
In addition to Cho, the College Democrats also invited undergraduates from the ReproJustice Action and Dialogue Collective and anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better.
Members of ReproJustice Action and Dialogue Collective spoke of links between Kavanaugh’s political leanings and sexual violence and argued that his appointment to the Court will threaten federal protections for abortion and healthcare.
Amelia Y. Goldberg '19, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said the investigation into the allegations has been “bungled." She said the lack of Senate response invites comparisons to the Brock Turner case, in which a then-Stanford student served three months in prison after being charged with sexually assaulting a classmate.
The College Democrats closed their meeting with a phone banking effort. They encouraged attendees to call their senators to demand they reject Kavanaugh’s nomination.
Ford and Kavanaugh are slated to testify regarding her allegations in front of the Senate Thursday morning. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to take a final vote on the nominee Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior forward Maddie Earle made the first hat trick of her career count. Her remarkable efficiency, with three goals on three shots, led Harvard field hockey to a 4-1 victory over No. 18 University of Maine, dealing the Black Bears (8-1, 0-0 American East) its first loss of the season and earning the Crimson  (7-1, 1-0 Ivy) its first victory over a ranked opponent.
Coupled with a 6-0 trouncing of Yale on Sept. 21, the National Field Hockey Association voted this week to rank Harvard 12th nationally, the Crimson’s highest ranking in program history.
Harvard leapt out to a 1-0 lead in the 13th minute with a rebound goal by Earle off a shot from freshman forward Rachel Greenwood. The Crimson’s stellar defense kept the remainder of the half scoreless with Maine attempting just two shots on goal..
Three minutes into the second half, Earle struck again, scoring off an assist from junior midfielder Bente van Vlijmen. The Black Bears responded at 49:44 with what would be Maine’s only goal of the game.
Earle completed her hat trick in the 58th minute, with a second assist from van Vlijmen, securing Harvard’s win. An empty-net goal by sophomore forward Natalie Sicher in the 69th minute closed out the Crimson’s 4-1 victory.
The victory came in no small part due to Harvard’s defense, which held the Black Bears to six shots against the Crimson’s 13. Freshman goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo delivered four saves, allowing only a single shot past her in 70 minutes of play.
Earle’s hat trick takes her to six goals on the season, the second only to van Vlijmen. Sicher and van Vlijmen have also recorded hat tricks this year.
With such solid performances from Earle and Shahbo across a two-game weekend, Harvard swept the Ivy League Field Hockey Weekly Awards. Earle was recognized as Offensive Player of the Week for her hat trick against Maine and a second-half goal against Yale, and Shahbo was awarded Defensive Player of the Week for her shutout against Yale and four saves against the Black Bears.
The Crimson will continue Ancient Eight play with an away game at Penn (4-4, 1-0 Ivy) on Saturday before returning to host Bryant (2-8, 0-0 Northeast) on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before the Harvard football team strapped on the pads and took the field for its week one game against the University of San Diego, it was already eliminated from playoff contention.
No, it’s not that the Crimson was projected to be so bad that any hope of success was an afterthought. Rather, the team plays in the Ivy League, the only football conference at the Division I level that opts out of advancing any of its teams to the postseason. For anyone unfamiliar with the yearly crowning of the Ancient Eight champion, the team with the best in-conference record automatically claims the glory. But actually not quite — if two teams (or three, or four…) conclude their seasons with identical records, there is no tiebreaker system and the teams simply share the designation of Ivy League champions.
Just last year, with just two games remaining for each squad, it was a very real possibility that seven(!) teams could have shared the title. Despite the entertainment value that would have come from such a quirky finish and the fact that Yale would not have been the outright champion, I imagine it would not have been satisfying to the average fan or to any team involved.
Now maybe I am overreacting by discussing an obscure possibility that didn’t end up coming to fruition anyway, or by discussing the postseason before September is even over, but plenty of times teams have tied for the top spot in the conference. I would venture to say that a tie at the top leaves both teams wanting more since it is not a clean, clear-cut result. The season consists of months on end of hard work in the weight room and on the practice fields, regimented eating and sleeping, and 10 games in which players put forth the entirety of their effort, not to mention having to keep up with schoolwork during that span. Tying for the title is still no doubt better than falling short, but there has to be some way to reward the best of the best in the Ivy League.
The conference’s reluctance to add its own playoff or to allow its teams to compete for an FCS championship seems to stem mostly from tradition. However, that tradition has not been part and parcel of the league for its entire existence. For instance, in 1920 Harvard traveled to Pasadena, Calif., to compete in the Rose Bowl (then known as the Tournament East-West Football Game). The trip was well-worth it for the Crimson, as it won by a score of 7-6 over Oregon. Yes, college football was a completely different landscape back then, but the competition level of Ancient Eight teams generally aligns very well with other FCS programs, and Ivy League playoff teams would not be fed to the wolves by having to compete against teams that are significantly more skilled.
Not only have Ivy League teams competed in bowl games before, but the league is also making a number of changes to slowly but surely modernize the product on its fields. Games are played on Friday nights under the lights and are broadcast on nationally-available networks like ESPN as well as popular local networks like NESN. Just this year, the league instituted a replay policy by which plays can be reviewed and calls can be overturned, bringing the conference up to speed with other top FCS leagues. Revolutionary player safety initiatives are being born within the league, such as Dartmouth’s use of tackling dummies in practices. The Ivy League does not have to cling to the past.
Seemingly something that would make it easier for football teams to advance to postseason contention is that other major sports in the conference already do. Two seasons ago, the Harvard men’s hockey team competed in the Frozen Four at the United Center in Chicago. The conference also recently instituted its own playoff to determine which of its basketball teams, on both the men’s and women’s sides, receive an automatic bid to March Madness.
Some of the apparent drawbacks to postseason football appear to be its conflict with players’ academic commitments near the end of the fall semester and the fact that it adds on additional weeks of playing, which could be construed as conflicting with the player safety angle mentioned above. As for both, there are really no obvious solutions that come to mind, so if the Ivy League were to ever consider entering the playoff realm, it would have to weigh the good with the bad. However, in an age of increasing visibility and talent level within the league, I believe it must consider breaking with tradition and taking the postseason plunge.

The contest was the first home performance of the season for the Bears (0-2, 0-1), a team struggling to find a win after blanking in Ancient Eight throughout the 2017 season and subsequently finishing last in the division.
With the ball and the momentum of an antsy home crowd, McGovern carried the team downfield in his first drive. When there wasn’t a man open through the air, the sophomore starter used his feet to reset the downs.


The drive ended in a field goal, a result Brown coach Phil Estes lamented in his postgame interview. “We got away with just a field goal,” Estes said. “We should have had a touchdown in that first drive and what a difference that would have made.”


The Crimson’s sophomore quarterback capitalized. In a drive that featured three passes that sailed for over 20 yards, in his final target Smith found senior wideout Henry Taylor who snagged the spiral and sprinted in to the end zone to earn Harvard its first lead of the night. The Bears never recovered.
From there it was all Crimson en route to the 31-17 victory.


Harvard introduced its third sophomore tailback of the season and he started with a bang. Taking the ball from Smith, second-year B.J. Watson took his first rushing attempt of the contest to the house, traversing the 43 yards between the give and the Bears’ end zone.


Across the three sophomore backs — Watson, Aaron Shampklin and Devin Darrington — the Crimson accumulated 237 rushing yards, 205 more than Brown.
The game was not nearly as one-sided as it seems from the box score. To start the fourth quarter, Smith was intercepted as the visiting team knocked on the door of another touchdown. McGovern led the ensuing air assault.


The Bears scored, knocking Harvard’s lead down to seven with 12 minutes left remaining. Three snaps later, Smith faced a third down deep in his own territory. The sophomore escaped pressure and found the open senior tight end Dan Werner to move the sticks.


Three more times, Smith face similar third-down situations. Each time, the sophomore composed himself and found the open receiver, leading the Crimson on a game clinching touchdown drive. It was senior wide receiver Adam Scott that caught the drive’s final pass, maneuvering 22 yards into the Brown touchdown.


The home crowd, already spotty after the first half domination, lost all enthusiasm. 


With only four minutes remaining, Harvard curtailed McGovern and drained the clock.


On the night, the Crimson receiving core earned 251 yards, outpacing Harvard’s ground game for the first time this season. Leading the wide outs, Scott accumulated 90 yards on a career high eight catches, while senior Justice Shelton-Mosley took his six catches for 65 yards.
The Crimson left Providence, R.I., with its eighth straight victory in the series.

We all remember the dismay when, as soon as you were liberated from your parents during Opening Days, you meet your proctor. Proctors, practically the first line of defense against underage drinking and excessive partying, play a crucial role in the freshman experience. And while you may only think of your proctor as out-of-touch and out-dated (some are parents, for heaven’s sake), we contend that not all proctors are complete killjoys. To demonstrate, we sat down with recent graduate, Shilpa Tummala ’16, Harvard’s youngest and coolest proctor.
Have you ever been mistaken for a student?
“Yes, multiple times!” Gesturing at her Harvard Athletics jacket, Tummala, who played varsity basketball for four years, admitted. “Although I’m sure it has a lot to do with my attire.”
What are the advantages of being the youngest proctor?
“I think it goes without saying, but the age helps with connecting to my residents! Since I was only an undergraduate two years ago, I totally understand the struggle.”
What are the disadvantages of being the youngest proctor?
“It’s hard to be seen as legitimate sometimes. When I tried to shut down a party in Weld, they had no idea who I was. They literally tried to invite me in!”
Looking back, what's one thing you did as an undergraduate that you would now prohibit as a proctor?
After a moment of silence, Tummala laughed off the question. “I can’t really answer that question! But Harvard is a great place — I seriously love it here. Not only is it a place of growth but also a place of protection. Proctors try to encourage their students to experiment.”
Yeah. Sure. Whatever that means.
During our time with Tummala, we were reminded of the importance of our proctors. So even if they've already busted a few of your dorm parties this year, go to their study break and show your proctor some love.
