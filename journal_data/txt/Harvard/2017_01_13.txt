After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has nominated eight alumni to fill five spots on the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body, that will become vacant later this year.
The Board of Overseers is a 30-member body of Harvard alumni and affiliates that works with the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, to advise the University President on major institutional decisions. Its members serve for six-year terms, and Harvard degree holders vote every spring to elect five new members.
This year’s group of nominees include alumni in careers of academia, public education, finance, medicine, and the law, and hail from across the country. The eight nominees, announced Jan. 9, are Paul L. Choi ’86, a partner at a Sidley Austin LLP; Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar ’93, a justice on the Supreme Court of California; Darienne B. Driver, the superintendent of the Milwaukee Public School District; Carla A. Harris ’84, the vice chair of wealth management and managing director at Morgan Stanley; Lane MacDonald ’88, the president of FMR Diversified Investments; Elizabeth D. Samet ’91, an English professor at West Point; Craig R. Stapleton ’67, senior advisor at Stone Point Capital; and Leslie P. Tolbert ’73, a neuroscience professor at the University of Arizona.
If elected, Choi—who previously served as the president of the Harvard Alumni Association—said he intends to examine financial barriers that might prevent a qualified candidate from attending the University.
“I think one of the real challenges is that there’s an increasingly competitive world in terms of attracting the best students and faculty,” Choi said. “I think we have to do whatever we can to reduce the barriers for attracting the best students, and part of that is making sure that money and financial aid is not an impediment to anybody.”
Tolbert wrote in an email that while she does not have a “particular agenda” at this point in the election process, she is interested in investing in Harvard’s science and engineering programs.
“I’d hope to put some focus on areas relating to science and engineering broadly and to the life sciences in particular, where there is such opportunity for research and education to have a significant impact on quality of life,” Tolbert wrote.
The HAA nominated each of this year’s eight nominees, but candidates can also enter the Overseers race as petition candidates. Last year, five alumni launched a petition campaign on an unconventional ticket: eliminate undergraduate tuition and make public how Harvard considers race in its admissions practices—a platform that University President Drew G. Faust and others criticized.
While none of the ticket's five members were ultimately elected to the Board of Overseers, it drew national media attention to a usually quiet alumni process. After the race, the University changed the election rules, moving the process online and increasing the number of signatures a petition candidate needs to get on the ballot.
Neither Tolbert nor Choi said they knew of any alumni intending to enter the race as petition candidates.
“It’s difficult to predict when or for what purpose alumni independently seek election, as there have been a broad variety of aspirants who have successfully made the ballot in the more than 100 years they’ve been eligible to do so,” Philip W. Lovejoy, HAA's current executive director, wrote in an email.
This year’s deadline for alumni to gather signatures for a petition to enter the race is Feb. 1.
Any Harvard degree holder is eligible to vote in the election. Ballots will be mailed to eligible voters by April 1, and must be received by Harvard by May 16 to be counted.
Five members will step down from the Board of Overseers this year: Richard W. Fisher ’71, Verna C. Gibbs ’75, Nicole P. Haughey ’93, Flavia Buarque de Almeida, and Kenji Yoshino ’91.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Staffers from Harvard Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic clarified definitions of “sanctuary” spaces in an online seminar Wednesday, offering Harvard’s undocumented students individual legal consultation as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.
Philip L. Torrey, a Law School lecturer who led the seminar, said the label “sanctuary” could mean a number of things in practice, ranging from the physical prevention of immigration enforcement officials from entering a space to the guarantee that those officials have valid warrants before entering.
“The term ‘sanctuary’ has no specific legal definition,” Torrey said.
In December, University President Drew G. Faust said she would not adopt the “sanctuary” term for Harvard’s campus, adding that she thought creating a “sanctuary campus” would further endanger undocumented students. Two weeks later, Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton designated the Church a “sanctuary” space.
Torrey and fellow Law School lecturer Sabrineh Ardalan also briefed attendees on how to navigate immigration issues as Trump transitions to the White House. The political outsider drew ire throughout his presidential campaign, which many say stirred anti-immigrant sentiment throughout the country.
Ardalan and Torrey began the event by outlining Trump’s 100-day plan on immigration issues, which includes passing an act to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and beginning to remove immigrants with criminal convictions or prior orders of removal. Trump has also pledge to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation.
President Barack Obama established DACA by executive order in 2012 to provide temporary legal protections, like a driver’s license and Social Security number, to qualifying undocumented young adults. Administrators estimate that about 40 undocumented students—many of them DACA beneficiaries—currently attend Harvard.
Despite Trump’s strong rhetoric on the campaign trail, however, Torrey said that “it’s still sort of a guessing game at this point as to what [Trump’s] priorities are…We won’t know for sure until the President-elect takes office.”
Ardalan advised that it was important for students and their families to understand their rights and the potential avenues of immigration protection available to them, regardless of federal immigration policies to come.
“No matter who is president, [undocumented immigrants] are afforded certain rights by the Constitution,” she said, adding that undocumented immigrants are also guaranteed Miranda rights: the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.
Ardalan also advised undocumented students against opening their doors for immigration officials unless presented with a signed warrant from a judge, which she said could be slid under the door.
“We are recommending that everybody do a consultation with a lawyer, and for students who are undocumented or DACA who are at Harvard, we are recommending they set up an individual consultation with us at the beginning of next semester,” Ardalan said.
Sponsored by the College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, the presentation was organized as part of a University-wide effort to support Harvard’s undocumented students following Trump’s upset victory over Hillary Clinton in November.
In the election’s aftermath, hundreds rallied in Harvard Yard, calling on administrators to take concrete action to protect Harvard’s undocumented students. A petition with their demands garnered more than 4,000 signatures, and received endorsements from hundreds of faculty members.
In response, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana reiterated that he will prioritize protecting undocumented students at the College, and Faust said she will increase lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C. under the Trump administration.
In a Nov. 28 email to Harvard affiliates, Faust said the University further intended to expand the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program at the Law School and bring immigration experts to campus to provide legal resources for undocumented students.
Loc Truong, the Office of Student Life’s Director of Diversity and Inclusion Programs, echoed the University’s commitment to undocumented students in his concluding remarks for the seminar.
“We’ve always supported undocumented students. It’s our responsibility that students have the resources they need to be successful at Harvard and beyond,” Truong said. “Just with the presidential election, we’ve been more intentional with our support.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twelve Harvard Law School professors will advise University President Drew G. Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 in the search for the next dean of the Law School, the University announced Thursday.
In an email to Law School affiliates, Faust outlined the process for selecting the successor to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, who said last week that she plans to step down at the conclusion of the academic year after eight years as dean.
Minow will return to her role as a full-time professor as the Law School’s capital campaign exceeds its $305 million fundraising goal and the school prepares for its Bicentennial celebrations planned throughout 2017.
Faust invited students, professors, and alumni at the Law School to provide input into the dean search, offering an email address dedicated to the process. She wrote that the letters and emails will help her identify candidates and learn about the school.
“We will particularly appreciate input on the principal opportunities and challenges facing Harvard Law School in the years ahead, on the professional and personal attributes you regard as most important to seek in the next dean, and on particular individuals at Harvard or elsewhere who you believe warrant serious consideration for the deanship,” Faust wrote.
Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz said previously that he expects the new dean will come from within Harvard’s faculty, as deans traditionally have in the past. The University has not appointed an  interim dean at the Law School, and both Minow and other professors have said they expect Faust will choose the next dean before July. The secretive search process that resulted in Minow’s selection in 2009 lasted about five months and had no clear front-runner until the final announcement, which was made in June.
Professors Gabriella Blum, Jack L. Goldsmith, Annette Gordon-Reed, Wendy B.  Jacobs, Louis Kaplow, Randall Kennedy, Richard Lazarus, Daniel L. Nagin, Carol Steiker, Kristen A. Stilt, Guhan Subramanian, and Jonathan L. Zittrain will serve on the Faculty Advisory Committee. None were available for comment.

Three years after the Crimson women's first opportunity to take the ice at Fenway was spoiled by inclement weather, Harvard finally got its chance to play at America's Most Beloved Ballpark on Tuesday night.
Senior goaltender Brianna Laing leads the Crimson out of the visitor's dugout on a path towards the rink stretched across the baseball diamond.

Harvard held BC's third-ranked scoring offense at bay in the first period. Laing and junior defenseman Chelsea Ziadie (24) cut out this chance for BC forward Kristyn Capizzano midway through the frame.
Sophomore forward Kate Hallett wasn't the only one wearing Number 14 for Harvard on Tuesday. Every Crimson skater sported a "14" patch on each shoulder to honor the iconic Denna Laing—the older sister of Harvard's Brianna and Lexie—who dropped the ceremonial puck before the game.

Period two belonged to the Eagles, who scored twice in the frame, prompting celebrations like this one between junior goaltender Katie Burt and classmate defenseman Megan Keller.

Rain splashed against the ice all night long, and conditions grew worse with time. Co-captain Sydney Daniels and the Crimson set course for their much drier locker room at the second intermission trailing 2-0.
Laing makes one of her 27 saves—this one on a shot that skidded through the rain-soaked crease in the third period. Late in the game, Laing spent several stoppages of play squeegeeing the area around the goalmouth with her stick.
But in spite of Laing's efforts, the crease never remained dry for long.
The Eagles scored one last time with 7:06 remaining in the game when redshirt freshman Erin Connolly, a South Boston native, notched her second goal of the night to put BC up 3-0.
Harvard would not leave the ballpark empty-handed, however. The Eagles skated away victorious, but freshman forward Kat Hughes (19) put the Crimson on the board with 5:02 left to play, earning the night's final trip around the bases.
