After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The eleventh season of “Ivory Tower” begins this fall with a new story that one executive producer, Joao A. Vogel ’16, describes as part “Romeo and Juliet,” part “Godfather,” with a Harvard twist. The coming season will feature two “student groups”—the Italian Mafia and the Ninjas—vying for control of the UC. “Ivory Tower” has been kicking for more than a decade, and after a severely truncated single-episode season last year, the new leaders are looking to resurrect the show.
Though many students are involved in the college’s vibrant theater community, fewer give top priority to the less-developed, newer world of Harvard University Television. HUTV showcases comedy news like “On Harvard Time,” sketch comedy such as “Respectably French!” and soap operas/sitcoms like the soon-to-be-revived “Ivory Tower.”
Alexander J. Iascone ’16, the season’s new director and one of the student leaders of the show who is looking to “redeem” the series, started acting on the show as soon as he got to Harvard.
“I try out for everything,” he says, citing the reason he got cast in “Ivory Tower” as his chemistry with fellow auditioners. Though “Ivory Tower” participates in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s Common Casting, they don’t use “sides”—short scenes for prospective actors to read—like most other shows do, Vogel explains.
Iascone thinks this process of using improvisational scenes to cast new actors helps make their television community strong.
“We look for people we can really relate to, either who could create a strong character or create a funny character…. I think that kind of carries over to everyday life,” Iascone says.
Like Iascone, many who become involved with “Ivory Tower” are freshman looking for a new community. Others, like Taylor A. Cressler ’14, one of the new leads, find the show because their friends are involved.
Some make the transition from HRDC to television in order to try something new. Vogel also emphasizes the pull of the “fantasy” of being on TV, adding that the recorded nature of web shows makes the entire process more accessible to the actors and their audience. “[It’s] the fact that you can share it on Facebook, you can send it to your friends; if you’re an international student you can send it back home,” Vogel says. “Whereas theater—it happens and all you have are your good memories. You don’t have something to hold on [to].”
Though both HUTV and HRDC involve many of the same students, Teis D. Jorgensen ’14, who acted in the short-lived 10th season, explained some of the gaps between the two worlds.
“The theater community is very well established; there [are] a lot of systems in place...a lot of performance spaces,” Jorgensen says. “TV at Harvard is still growing; there’s still a lot more it can do.”
Cressler explains that many students arrive on campus with the knowledge of what it takes to put on a theater show, but the same is not necessarily true for creating a TV show. He says that learning how to light a scene for television, or learning to market to a particular audience, are not skills that an average student actor would pick up in high school. To remedy the skills gap between theater and TV, Jorgensen suggests trying to create more independent projects and spaces for people interested in television to come together to showcase TV and short film.
“There [are] probably lots of actors who would love to act in VES films and probably a lot of VES people who need actors, and some sort of connection isn’t happening there,” Jorgensen says. Cressler had an even bigger vision for the future of Harvard TV, saying his ideal for HUTV would be an entire station for the shows produced by Harvard students. Currently TV shows at Harvard have separate platforms connected by the HUTV name, but primarily uploaded to YouTube.
In terms of the future of “Ivory Tower,” Iascone says he just wants their viewership back.
“If we can get a good amount of people who are outside of the Harvard community…to watch it and maybe comment, that will mean the word has spread and that it is a success,” Iascone says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“My whole family made a circumference of ghosts, with me the sole living member in the middle,” reflects Charlie Crosby, the protagonist of Paul Harding’s “Enon.” In this follow-up to his 2009 novel “Tinkers,” Harding returns to the same location, the Massachusetts town of Enon; the same family, two generations later; and the same theme, death and the relationships that can transcend it. For “Enon” opens with nothing less than the loss of a child: an only child, a 13-year-old child, a child crushed under a car in the waning days of summer. She is Charlie’s daughter, and, as Harding imagines in language both hauntingly vivid and intriguingly original, she is Charlie’s life. Perhaps none can understand the loss of a child except those who have suffered through it, but through a subtle interweaving of bittersweet memories and hallucinated realities, Harding gets as close as many readers will hopefully ever experience to it.
From the novel’s outset, Harding sets up a fully realized world for Charlie, his wife, and his newly deceased daughter Kate. “I looked at her small, colorful, neatly folded T-shirts and my knees gave out,” Harding writes as Charlie, hours after Kate’s death, tries to find cremation clothes. From ramshackle old houses to sunrise birdcalls to the pattern of shifting leaves on a sunny day, Harding perfectly portrays the brief moments in time that make a story’s background more than it appears. This is the street Charlie taught Kate to bike on, and that is the woodland path they traipsed along for hours at a time. Through frequent flashbacks sparked by present observations, Harding masterfully explores the connections Charlie makes between the present and the past as he descends into a madness of grief.
This madness is where Harding’s deceivingly ordinary tale takes a turn for the spectacular—and it is this risk-taking that makes the novel shine far above more commonplace portrayals of grief. Charlie, a man who already lives in his head, turns to a potent cocktail of painkillers and alcohol to get by. “The empty house held its silence like a solid volume,” Charlie muses darkly, desperate to find an escape. “There was weight to it.” The mind of a drug addict proves surprisingly fertile ground, and Harding navigates this new landscape through sharp tonal shifts. To the world, Charlie is a wraith, a strung-out and unkempt man worthy of equal parts pity and revulsion; yet in his overactive and disturbed mind, he communes with the dead and sees his daughter die over and over in increasingly haunting scenarios. Harding’s deft juxtaposition of these two worlds—one real, one imagined, and both frightening—creates an incredibly potent portrayal of a mind unraveled by grief. “What if there were to be a phone somewhere in the woods,” Charlie wonders wildly in an early moment of incredulity, “a chthonic hotline made of dark horn, resting on a bone cradle, that patched me through to Kate in her urn?”
It is this preoccupation with death, seen from the perspective of one still alive, that provides the book’s most potent scenes.  Unsurprisingly, the town graveyard features prominently across Charlie’s range of lucidity. Even as a boy, the cemetery’s caretaker, a one-legged, colorblind veteran who, as Charlie memorably puts it, “saw the lush green lawns of the cemetery as blood-red,” fascinated him. As an adult encumbered by both grief and a mind-altering drug habit, he imagines thousands of long-dead citizens of Enon “migrating beneath the foundations of our houses and the fairways of the golf courses, trading ribs and teeth and shins and knuckles, commuting under baseball diamonds and the beds of streams, snagging up on roots and rocks, shelves of granite and seams of clay.” Refreshing, haunting, and original descriptions like these prove that Harding is not a man to take words, or the world, at face value. Halfway between drugged morbid hallucinations and his normal mind, Charlie knows “there are certainly more citizens of Enon beneath its fifty-four hundred acres than there are above it.”
It is this combination of and friction between two minds that makes “Enon” such a successfully original portrayal of grief. Charlie doesn’t just mourn the loss of his daughter. He sees her in the afterlife befriending a centuries-dead Enon teenager who was accused of witchcraft and executed in Salem. He sees her face in pictures of the town from the 19th century, sees her berating his present behavior, and more than anything else, sees her in his slipping memories.
Though Charlie’s struggle to achieve sobriety and come to terms with his daughter’s death forms one backbone of the novel, another is this continuity between past and present. In “Enon,” Harding revisits much of the same territory as he did in “Tinkers.” Yet far from being overkill, his insightful exploration of the connection between family, place, love, and time rings all the truer. “Enon” inspires grief as much as celebrates it.

Former Expos preceptor Paul Harding returned to Harvard on Tuesday, not to teach but to preview his upcoming novel, “Enon,” at the Coop. Though Harding is now instead the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the novel “Tinkers”, the influence of his previous teaching experiences remains evident in his recurring emphasis on revision, his eagerness to spell out insights in unambiguous terms, and the surprising openness with which he shares details of his growth between novels.
The Harvard Crimson: Are there certain methods of working that you prefer to others?
Paul Harding: I actually don’t have lots of little writers’ fetishes, but one of them that I do have is that I always keep my reading and writing notes in these little four-by-six spiral notebooks that I have to get from Bob Slate, which is right in Harvard Square. I buy them by the dozen, ’cause I’m afraid they’re gonna go out of business…. I constantly write down ideas for lines or write down quotes from books I like.… I’ll come up with a sheaf of handwritten things that are on cocktail napkins, or bookstore receipts, and then I’ll type them into the laptop.
THC: What has changed in your writing habits in between your first and second novels?
PH: “Enon” is about twice as long as “Tinkers,” so I had to write a book that was twice as long in about half the time…. In between the two books you learn, sort of, what was just sort of...[it was like] having to reinvent the wheel every day. You know, dumb luck, beginner’s growing pains.... I don’t write very efficiently. I write more than I need to and then I burn it back down, I distill it back down—and then I revise it again and I break it down, and I revise it again…. I thought with “Tinkers” it was just that I didn’t know how to do it, I’m not particularly good at it…but it turns out that’s just how I get the best prose.
THC: So it was less about developing writers’ muscles, and more about recognizing that this was just the habit of writing itself.
PH: Well, it’s both. I think it’s true that I’m in writing shape. I can sit down, and in the first draft I can write better sentences right out of the gate. And revision now is more devoted to making sure the sentences are consistent to the character and the larger vision of the book…. But then there’s still that vetting process, the process of just making sure they are still as good as I can possibly make them.
THC: You mention that while writing “Tinkers,” you were also busy raising young sons. Did these experiences inform how you wrote the novel, and in particular its central father-son relationship?
PH: Yeah, my kids helped me because they burned away any impulses I might have had for being precious or [a] diva…. The second you have children, it’s like: boy, you thought you didn’t have any time before, and then you realize what it’s actually like to not have any time.
But then when I had children, it’s like it opened up a whole other dimension of my humanity that I otherwise wouldn’t have known was there, if I hadn’t had them. It was like the textbook definition of the word profound: it was profoundly difficult, but it was profoundly heartening, and lovely, too….
“Tinkers” wouldn’t have been what it is without having [had my] children…. Now the kids are kind of older, and they keep me humble in other ways too. They both call the book “Stinkers”! They’re like, “how’s that book Stinkers doing?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a human being is born, how does his or her story develop? With a neat beginning and an end, does it follow the trajectory of a straight line? Cuban writer and artist Severo Sarduy offered one explanation, according to a press release on the School of the Museum of Fine Arts' website: "[B]iography usually happens before birth and then expands (or dilates)." This angle forms the theme under which curator Jorge Antonio Fernández Torres brings together contemporary Cuban voices from the art world in an exhibition that opened on Sept. 9 at the SMFA.
"Dilated Biography: Contemporary Cuban Narratives" is ambitious in scope—it features the works of 15 Cuban contemporary artists from different walks of life. While new media and conceptual art constitute the majority of the works on display, the artistic strategies exhibit a wonderful breadth of authorial modes–from the performative (Felipe Dulzaides' "Ariba de la Bola" ["On the Ball"]) to the interactive-documentary (Grethell Rasúa's "Con Tu Propio Sabor" ["With Your Own Taste"]). "The exhibition...represents the coexistence of different memories [of Cuba]," Fernández Torres said in his curatorial statement.
Fernández Torres, who most recently undertook the mammoth task of co-curating the Cuban Pavillion at the 55th Venice Biennale with a show of 15 international and Cuban artists, seems generally insouciant about putting artworks of such diverse hues in direct dialogue with one another. He hopes that the mere atmospheric resonance amongst them will help highlight what he calls their individual poetics. "Cubans are eclectic, even in the way they think," he says half-jokingly. Sarduy, he says, conceived of the medley of cultures that is Cuba today not as an outcome of transculturation, but as the result of cultural layering.
San Francisco-based artist Tony Labat, who participates in "Dilated Biography" with two works conceived around forty years apart, makes a strong case for this phenomenon. His Californian brand of deadpan conceptualism is unmistakable among works of other Cuban artists both living on and outside the island today. This marked difference, Labat attests, has persisted through decades. "[I noticed it] some time in the late 1980s when I was invited to an exhibition ironically called 'Outside Cuba'," he says. "It was the very first time [when I participated in a group exhibition of Cuban artists], and my work looked strangely—and beautifully—out of place."
Labat's "Dialectic IV" (1978-2003), for instance, is composed of some 60 loaves of bread leaning against a red-painted wall. It was a response to his experience of discovering a Diego Rivera mural in the Student Gallery upon his arrival at the San Francisco Art Institute from what he describes as a very hostile Cuban exile community in Miami. "Seeing in the Student Gallery the Diego Rivera mural was... a moment of feeling that was the right atmosphere for me," he says. "I think I felt at home within the [counterculture] legacy of San Francisco. I felt as if it was the continuation of my foundation, growing up with the Revolution.
In retrospect, Labat's ability to think of his oeuvre not as hybrid but homogeneous, smoothly flowing from Havana to San Francisco, echoes what Fernández Torres describes as Sarduy's strong Zen inclination to be harmonious with himself and receptive to his surroundings. This tendency––a declaration of the superiority of inhaling and exhaling over the restraints of time, space, and identity––is echoed by Fernández Torres when he, through a translator, paraphrases Sarduy's response to a question on whether he misses Cuba. "For me, Cuba isn't just a place,” he says. “Cuba is an attitude––my body. It is everything somatic that exists in me.
“Now I am here in Copacabana” he continues, “and I am looking out at the Brazilian countryside, this beautiful Brazilian landscape that is beautiful. And I don't want to be anywhere else... aside from here. That's also Cuba. Cuba isn't just a place: it is an experience, and it is also an attitude."

"Wrecking Ball"
Miley Cyrus, "BANGERZ"
Fresh off what might have been the most internet-sensational performance of all time, Miley released “Wrecking Ball,” her second single off of the upcoming “BANGERZ.” In an interview with MTV, Cyrus suggested that her self-proclaimed history-making performance would lead to more interest in her work, and, sweet nibblets, it appears she was right. The video for “Wrecking Ball” already has over 90 million views and the song tops iTunes singles chart. The song itself showcases Cyrus’ pipes somewhat more than the drug soaked, Auto-Tuned “We Can’t Stop.” If you don’t watch the video, “Wrecking Ball” feels driven by more genuine emotion than the standard pop song. If you do watch the video, the song seems driven by nudity.
 
 
“My Party feat. Zebra Katz”
Icona Pop, “This Is...Icona Pop”
Icona Pop shot to iconic status after Lena Dunham danced to their hit “I Love It” in a mesh tank top on “Girls.” Call it the dance heard round the world. In anticipation of their upcoming album, “This Is… Icona Pop,” they turned back the clock with a stream-only remix of Lesley Gore’s 1963 single “My Party.” With its painfully simple lyrics (which hold up surprisingly well over the years) and the slowed-down beat, the song begs to be danced to. This may not become the anthem that Icona’s first single did, but it’s a good way to create buzz among people who think they’re destined to be a one-hit wonder.
 “Atlas” 
Coldplay, “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”
In a shocking turn of events, Coldplay’s new song has a single-word title and consists mainly of Chris Martin’s voice and a piano. Way to keep it new, guys.  “Atlas” probably won’t rise to the top like “Viva La Vida,” but as the theme to the new “Hunger Games: Catching Fire” film it will probably get a fair amount of play. That also accounts for the fairly sparse lyrics that are mostly about fire. But at this point, if you like Coldplay then you’ll like everything they do from now until the end of time. So…enjoy?

Robert De Niro can deliver the word “fuck” in a dozen different contexts and still accurately convey the emotion of the scene. As an aging mafia member, De Niro adeptly assumes his role as Giovanni Manzoni in “The Family,” a Luc Besson film about an unlikely family’s relocation to northern France as a part of the witness protection program. Though the premise is entirely implausible, the movie manages—almost effortlessly—to be both comic and gruesome. Mainly due to the practiced acting of older stars like De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Tommy Lee Jones, the somewhat banal script passes as hilarious at its best moments, but reveals itself as ridiculous in moments of weaker acting.
The newly renamed and displaced “Blake” family find themselves without a jar of American peanut butter in Normandy at the start of the film. They must try to fit their homicidal, violent tendencies into a quaint, French countryside or risk being discovered and murdered by the members of the mafia that Manzoni (De Niro) betrayed in order to keep himself out of jail. Their first few days are fraught with violence: Maggie (Pfeiffer) sets fire to the local grocery store in a moment of vindication, and the daughter Belle—played by an unsmiling Dianna Agron of “Glee” renown—savagely beats up a group of boys with a badminton racquet.
Though hilarious, these exaggerated scenes of violence are not always backed up by character development. Pfeiffer is compelling on screen as a rule, but the harmless conversation she overhears in the grocery store—in which stereotypically snotty French natives discuss how fat and ignorant all Americans must be—hardly seems fuel enough for Maggie to set the place on fire. Likewise, Belle’s sudden violent outburst with a badminton racquet comes across as pointless and random. This might also be a result of Agron’s lack of facial expression throughout the movie, which makes her seem like an incomprehensibly troubled teen, more disturbing than likeably messed up.
But the rest of the family does manage to play their characters as both amiable and sadistic, which is a saving grace for the often-ridiculous script. Pfieffer portrays Maggie tenderly following her initial outburst—she mistakenly confesses to a Catholic priest, expecting to be met with forgiveness, and is touchingly shocked when the jolly French priest casts her out of the church as an incarnation of the devil. De Niro, on the other hand, makes for a convincing mafia leader, complete with a heavy Brooklyn accent and apparently limited vocabulary. But De Niro’s portrayal of Giovanni does not lack a sense of background, and as the character attempts to write his memoirs, a genial side of the killer emerges. If not humane, De Niro’s character is at least good-humored; in a tender moment for the character, Giovanni confides in the FBI agent responsible for keeping him safe (Jones). Giovanni calls their relationship a “friendship,” to the other’s surprise. Hastily correcting his definition, De Niro points out that he killed all of his friends by betraying them to the FBI.
Perhaps the most touching part of the script—and one that was made better by solid acting—was the subplot of Giovanni’s son stepping into his father’s shoes. Attempting to enter a family business of which the product is murder and coercion, young Warren (John D’Leo) seems to be a copy of his father: cunning and manipulative with an irresistibly likable side. He even shares a physical resemblance to his father, with a mole on his cheek opposite Giovanni’s mole. As Warren learns to abuse the social structure of his high school, he manages to find himself in front of the school’s disciplinary board. Before scramming from the scene of his crimes, D’Leo charismatically says, “I want to speak with my lawyer,” and decides to run away to Paris to start living the life of a true mobster.
The essence of this particular family—their quirky violence and their sneaky coercion—holds strong throughout the film, with the legacy passing from father to son and the theme of relocation coming full circle. For the most part the film is enjoyably ridiculous with occasional bursts of honest character development, but the actors must do a lot of work to save it from coming off as simply a preposterous premise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The galleries are closed now. One of the largest collections of art in the country, spanning numerous continents, periods, and media, has been under wraps. Since it closed for renovation in 2008, it has been hidden away from the public and the student body who once enjoyed it. But as with the end of any era, rebirth is not far behind. The galleries of the Sackler may have shut their doors, but from the remnants of the University’s revered Fogg Museum, a new structure, perhaps puzzling at times to its Prescott Street neighbors, has risen. 
The newly renovated building is a mesmerizing mélange of materials, with panes of glass jutting out from its top and a metallic-gray wood façade that sticks out from the building’s core. And, impressively, these futuristic elements are fused seamlessly with the classic- Harvard brick body of the old Fogg Museum, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The massive combination—with new additions designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano—has been dubbed the New Harvard Art Museums, and when it opens in November 2014, it will house the collections of the Fogg, Busch-Reisinger, and Arthur M. Sackler Museums under one state-of-the-art roof.
 
But with its flashy new look, which extends throughout the inner galleries, it would seem that perhaps what was historically a teaching museum aspires to be something more—a tourist attraction. Harvard is already a destination in its own right, but will even more tourist traffic get in the way of the Harvard Art Museums’ purpose as a place for education? A concrete answer can only come in 14 months, but the team behind the new museum is currently striving to walk this thin line between educational hub and tourist magnet. The collection is filling in some of its gaps, and the museum as a whole will offer new platforms and spaces for studying art. The museum also hopes to include not merely students of art, but people from other disciplines and the larger Cambridge community as well. In this way, what began as a renovation of necessity has morphed into something far more ambitious, an attempt to expand the concept of a “teaching museum” in which the museum’s new architecture plays a key role.
THE MAKINGS OF A MODERN MUSEUM
 
Thomas W. Lentz is a man of carefully controlled passion. From the focused stare he emits through his clear-rimmed glasses to his deliberate but calm speech, everything about the director of the Harvard Art Museums exudes focus and determination. This determination extends to every aspect of the renovation. He seems to know just about everything about the project, down to the wood used in the gallery floor (it’s “walnut-stained oak”) . As he leads our tour through the museum’s now skeletal, white-walled interior, it becomes evident that Lentz wants the new museum to be an “experience.” The focus of the new galleries is on personal, individual interaction with their artworks, which here means smaller, more intimate rooms that contrast heavily with the museum’s courtyard, in which tall glass windows sit atop the classic Ionic columns of the original Fogg. The displays will be less dense than at other museums as well, with more space between the objects exhibited. “There’s clearly a big element of bigger, better, faster in this museum,” Lentz says. “But in many ways we’re trying to go slower and deeper at the same time.”
Lentz makes clear that to him, education will always be at the heart of the Museums’ purpose. “What has driven this entire project is our mission: we’re a teaching museum; we’re a university museum,” he says. “We’re not necessarily driven by attendance and revenue generation; what we’re all about is innovative teaching and learning.” The design of the building, however, shows a distinct aspiration for attracting the outside world; Lentz lists “transparency” and “accessibility” among the key tenets behind the renovation. The museum’s new structure, with large windows, galleries exposed to the street, and a café and shop open to non-museum visitors, seems dedicated to catching the eyes of passers by. “All of a sudden, it’s screaming, ‘This is an art museum,’” Lentz says of the new design.
For members of the public who aren’t within earshot, the museum will be launching a publicity campaign unmatched by any previous efforts. Daron J. Manoogian, director of communications for the Harvard Art Museums, lists print ads, social media, transportation advertising, and even radio among the undertakings in which the museum is investing. “[It’s] a pretty wide cross-section of different things, but more than we’ve ever done before,” says Manoogian. “We really want to be much more welcoming to the public at large and make sure that people can come and see our collections and experience the different kind of gallery spaces that we’ll have in this museum.”
CHARM OFFENSIVE
But while these new kinds of galleries may be a draw for the public, many elements of the museum were designed with students in mind. While the first through third floors are dedicated to public galleries, the futuristic fourth and fifth—as well as the basement—house brand-new facilities for study and conservation. The top floor, cocooned within the Piano-designed “glass lantern” that projects out from the roof, will be a new home to the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, which focuses on preserving and analyzing works of antiquity and training conservators. Charles S. Klee, a partner at Payette, a Boston architecture firm working on the project, says that aside from its aesthetic appeal, the glass roof of the building actually functions to manipulate natural light for conservation purposes through the use of a series of shades. “If I’m a conservator working on an object or a painting, I can use directional light at a controlled level to understand the texture of the work that I’m looking at,” he explains. Students will also have access to a 300-seat theater, a 100-seat lecture hall, and a 32-seat seminar room in the basement of the building, as well as an experimental space called the Materials Lab, which will explore issues of materiality and how raw materials interact.
The new museum will also attempt to reach out to students in departments other than the most common museum visitors—typically classics and history of art and architecture concentrators. This attempt starts with the architecture, as the Prescott Street ramp of the museum will connect directly to the Le Corbusier-designed ramp of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts next door. “It’s a little bit like Le Corbusier putting his arm around the Fogg,” says Klee, quoting Piano. This will make it almost effortless for students producing art to study art.
Perhaps the most important way the museum will connect with students from all departments—as well as the public—is through its expanded, streamlined Art Study Center on the fourth floor. Students, professors, and outside visitors will have the opportunity to request specific types of art for close observation and can even pick art from multiple regions and eras to put pieces in conversation with one another. “It’s essentially art on demand,” Lentz says.
The key to this area of the museum is its easy access. “They had study centers in the original Fogg, but they were behind three-foot wide doors,” says Klee. “And it was a really off-putting kind of event.” The Study Center now has a simple reception desk behind glass doors, and Lentz believes this redesign will be a vital tool for non-art departments. “The people who seemed to be most excited about the new museum were people [from areas] like engineering [and] marine biology,” he says. “They’re interested in works of art for all sorts of reasons we don’t think about, whether it’s materials, production, or process.”
THE TIES THAT BIND
Thomas B. F. Cummins stepped down from his position as chair of the Department of History of Art and Architecture in 2012, but he hasn’t lost his exuberance. Framed by a half-mane of less-than-tamed gray hair, he leans back in his chair and speaks animatedly of the new museum’s innovations and his department’s connection to them. “Tom Lentz, in discussion with the faculty…spent a lot of time going over classrooms, [asking], ‘How will we have access to this material?’ making it clear that we can conduct classes in there with the objects [from the collection] themselves,” he says. “From everything that we planned for and thought about, we should have extraordinary access to these collections and some good study rooms.”
Even the public exhibitions will be connected to academic study. Three 1,000-square-foot galleries are reserved as University Galleries, organized in tandem with FAS departments. One will be dedicated to the History of Art and Architecture Department, one will be for other departments, and one will be a new space for experimentation with the concept of exhibition. Even in the main galleries, ties to the museum’s greater purpose of education will be evident. Signs will advise curious visitors to explore further in the Art Study Center, and the collections will be modeled to reflect the way art history is studied. “Our American paintings and works of art are mixed in with our European material,” Lentz says. “In many ways that’s a reflection of the way American art history is now taught.”
When asked how the museum will represent his own area of expertise, Cummins bursts out laughing. “I use the Peabody,” he is quick to say; he is, after all, the Dumbarton Oaks professor of pre-Columbian and colonial art, an area that falls under the jurisdiction of Harvard’s Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Yet even Cummins might find reason to walk the Fogg’s walnut-stained oak floors. “The Peabody in particular is important to us, because it’s an enormous and very important collection and it sort of dovetails neatly with our gaps,” Lentz says as he stands in one of the empty gallery spaces. “One of the things we’re trying to do is forge much stronger relations with other collection resources at Harvard.” The new museum will attempt this from the beginning, opening with a showcase of African art borrowed from the Peabody. Though the museum will be using these objects as more of an exhibition than a study collection, Cummins anticipates and appreciates increased dialogue between the two museums, specifically the respective conservation staffs.
Less directly but just as importantly, the museum will work in tandem with many other on-campus efforts to teach art history. “The new museum will create a constellation of buildings and structures, inclusive of the Fine Arts Library, which is one of the most remarkable art history libraries I know, and the Sackler building, where History of Art and Architecture is housed, to create a rich set of resources for the teaching of art history,” says Yukio Lippit, a professor of Japanese art.
Both professors acknowledge the difficulty of balancing identities as a teaching museum and a public museum, but are optimistic about how this particular experiment will work. “It’s a difficult balance to achieve, but I think [the museum has] achieved it thus far, and it will only be able to fulfill this dual mandate better in the future,” Lippit says. Cummins notes that students will have their own entrances to the classrooms separate from the public entrance, and believes the tourist traffic won’t interfere to a great extent. “I say that now,” he adds quickly. “We’ll see how it works.”
BRIDGING THE GAP
“[The original Fogg] was 50 years behind renovation,” Cummins says, calling the old, cramped building with no climate control “disgraceful.” Yet Thomas Lentz and the museum team, who could have easily settled for a modestly improved space, have pulled out all the stops to create what Lentz calls “a real 21st-century art museum” that fulfills its mission as a teaching museum while presenting an expanded collection of objects to the public in new ways, even extending its educational resources to curious visitors.
The collection and the building that houses it are immensely impressive, but it is the people behind the scenes that are truly guiding the museum to connect deeply with the public and the rest of the University. Next fall, when the architects, designers and builders are gone, a new crew will take over—the curatorial staff—which will be just as committed to creating these connections. Lippit remarks that much of the staff is made up of colleagues of History of Art and Architecture faculty, which will undoubtedly keep the museum rooted in the University network. “A museum isn’t just a collection of objects,” he says. “It’s also a human resource.” Even with all its towering spectacle, the new museum hopes to remain flexible, accessible, human.

Matt J. Pollock wants you to “East Your Art Out!” That’s the slogan for HarborArts Festival 2013, an annual festival of which Pollock is executive director. This year’s festival commemorates the 2010 opening of Boston’s only sculpture park and one of Boston’s largest collections of modern public art, the Shipyard Gallery, with live music, food, and crafts. It will take place on Saturday from 12-7 p.m. with a musical line-up that includes Chris Kaz and the Rotations, Paul and Garo of the Four Elements, and DJ IllDub. 
  The festival is an annual event at the HarborArts Shipyard Gallery, located in the Boston Harbor Shipyard and Marina, curated in partnership with the UrbanArts Institute of MassArt, and juried by Randi Hopkins, curator at the Institute for Contemporary Art. HarborArts Inc., founded by Steve Israel, is a charitable organization that uses art to raise awareness about the need to protect oceans and waterways.  
  Pollock says he expects thousands of attendees if the weather cooperates. “We’re planning our biggest and best festival yet,” he says. The event will continue regardless of weather conditions on Saturday. “If it rains put on your raincoat, get your umbrella, come on down to the HarborArts Festival,” he says. 
The festival was initially intended to celebrate the close of Shipyard Gallery’s exhibit, "OccupyING the Present,” which features outdoor sculptures by the local artists' group Studios Without Walls.  Visitors can see the exhibit through October 15.
Admission is free and visitors will have the opportunity to buy items from local restaurants, vendors, and artists. There will also be face painting and opportunities for children to make art. Transportation to the shipyard is part of the fun, as City Water Taxi trips will be discounted to half price for the event. 
 “There’s more interactivity this year,” Pollock says. “There’s a mosaic workshop and a yoga workshop. There’s a community sculpture project.” Though the event is relatively new, Pollock is optimistic that the tradition will continue. “If we continue to get support from the community we’d like bigger bands, more art, more vendors. We’re hopeful we’re going to keep growing every year,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few years ago, students trudged wearily to psychology and statistics lectures through a concrete wasteland. The Science Center Plaza resembled not the bustling city square the name invokes, but instead little more than a stretch of asphalt dotted with patches of grass and filled with students only when they traversed it by necessity on their way to class.
Today, things are different. It took just over a year of construction—preceded by extensive planning—for the plaza to go from unremarkable eyesore to cherished common space. On a sunny early fall day, students lounge in comfy beanbag chairs, read and write under the shade of wide umbrellas, line up in front of gourmet food trucks, and even face off at giant chess on a board that doubles as a stage for a capella groups and other performers.
The reinvented Science Center Plaza makes clear the perks common spaces can provide not only to Harvard students but to all Cambridge residents. Harvard should continue developing similar initiatives, and we hope that those who helm future projects will solicit student and community input in the planning process.
We have said before that Harvard ought to provide students with a greater array of accessible and appealing social spaces. When students congregate in a public space, not specific to one House, club, or social organization, there is a much greater chance that they will run into friendly faces from all corners of the College. The Common Spaces Program has recognized this opportunity for community building, and the new Science Center Plaza is the first example of true success in establishing a space that draws enough crowds to achieve such a goal.
What’s more, we often lose sight of the fact that much of the land surrounding Harvard is owned not by the University but by the City of Cambridge. What takes place on that land—along with the land that Harvard does own—affects Cantabrigians just as much as it does Harvardians. The University and the city’s joint effort to upgrade the Science Center Plaza illustrates the value of cooperation between Harvard and Cambridge to work toward ends that benefit both the school and the city surrounding it.
In that spirit, we encourage Harvard and the Common Spaces Program to establish more social spaces, indoors and out. In doing so, we hope the University will take care to consult students and anyone else who may make use of such facilities by convening focus groups and conducting simple surveys. That way, common spaces will reflect the needs and desires of those who frequent them, pushing even more students to take advantage of an initiative that could change Harvard’s social scene for the better.

Over the weekend, some have compared the recent diplomatic efforts on Syria to the efforts that failed in the months preceding the 2003 invasion of Iraq. And there are some similarities between the language of this weekend’s agreement to destroy Syrian weapons stockpiles and UN Resolution 1441, which authorized UN weapons inspectors to enter Saddam’s Iraq in search of WMDs.
Despite the intentions of the current administration, lessons learned from the experiences of the former suggest that recent diplomatic efforts, if unsuccessful, might actually increase the chances of military engagement, including the possibility of American boots on the ground.
Of course, the circumstances surrounding the Syria and Iraq crises are not identical. The Bush administration advocated for regime change while the Obama administration has only advocated punitive measures to reinforce an international norm. At the same time, the Obama administration has made a significant effort to assure an American public overwhelmingly opposed to military action that U.S. troops would not enter Syria.
Even with these assurances, there is only one potential difference between the two situations that could completely prevent further U.S. engagement in the present case—the success of diplomacy.
But what are the chances that this weekend’s agreement will prove successful?
Consider its intentions. The agreement would bring chemical weapons under international control through the transfer and destruction of weapon stockpiles. It is a noble goal, and the negotiators for both Russia and the United States deserve praise for their efforts. However, it is still an extremely difficult task.
In general, it takes significant time and effort to destroy chemical weapons stockpiles. More than twenty years after the passage of the Chemical Weapons Convention, only Albania, India, and South Korea have completely eliminated their stockpiles. The United States has so far eliminated 90 percent of its stockpiles. Russia has eliminated 57 percent.
All of these efforts have taken place in relatively stable countries with strong government institutions exercising complete control of their stockpiles. Syria meets none of these conditions. As such, the logistics of both securing and transporting these armaments will be extremely complicated.
First of all, Syria does not possess the sufficient facilities for the destruction of these weapons. Although inspectors will have the technical knowledge to destroy some of the facilities on site, other weapons may have to be transported out of the country.
The transport of these weapons will have to occur amid a protracted civil war defined by humanitarian disaster and the previous use of chemical weapons. It will require significant resources to ensure that those weapons are secure. At worst, inadequate protection could lead to the capture and further use of those weapons.
Second of all, it is extremely hard to verify the extent of Assad’s arsenal. The agreement states that Assad has roughly 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons agents, a number he has to verify by next Friday. All the same, it will be extremely difficult to independently find, verify, and contain the exact amount. Given the insecurity on the ground, it is relatively easy for a small part of the stockpile to evade, intentionally or otherwise, the attention of the inspectors.
This is not to say that diplomatic efforts are futile or impossible, but rather to demonstrate their inherent difficulty and the extensive resources that those efforts will require. This is the primary concern. If any aspect fails or requires more resources, the United States will be pressured into further commitment to the process.
That commitment may include financial assistance. It may include missile strikes. At worst, it may include the deployment of American soldiers in order to secure the transportation lines for these weapons or to locate and isolate various weapons caches.
President Obama claimed in the acceptance speech for his Nobel Peace Prize that peace inherently depends on the credible threat to use force. He has made the same claim this past week when arguing that the current agreement would not have occurred without his threat of punitive missile strikes.
This weekend, diplomacy won. Strikes were removed from the table. The United States and Russia negotiated an agreement that has the support of the international community and the tentative acceptance of the Assad regime. This is a significant diplomatic success.
Yet, if diplomacy eventually fails, then the administration may have to reinstate its threat to use force. At that point, the threat to use force may require far more than missile strikes. And if the United States wants to retain the credibility of its deterrent, it may just have to act.

In July, Harvard Medical School announced that it would lay off the 31 janitors working for the subcontractor American Cleaning Company. The layoffs were expected to be complete by August 17th, but  thanks in part to student, worker, and community protest, the plan for the layoffs was postponed until mid-September. Now that the expected layoff date is coming around, the Harvard community is uniting once more in protest against the layoffs.
When Harvard University initially subcontracted work out to organizations like American Cleaning Company, they could be paid less and given fewer benefits than direct hires. Due to a push for the Wage and Benefit Parity Policy instituted in 2002, subcontracted workers now receive the same compensation that directly hired workers do. All of Harvard's workers, directly and indirectly hired, are promised decent jobs under this policy.
Today, there is no real reason for the Medical School to value its directly hired workers over its subcontracted ones. All workers employed at the Medical School and at all other Harvard-affiliated institutions work as equal members of the Harvard community, and no part of the Harvard community, especially not those among the lowest paid, should be singled out to bear the brunt of budget shortfalls. The Medical School claims to be dealing with a $40 million operating deficit, and yet tries to justify the decision to go through with layoffs by saying that the job cuts will save the institution upwards of $1 million.
Students at the Medical School have joined with the union that represents the subcontracted and directly hired workers, the Service Employees International Union 32BJ District 615. A petition has already been organized, and so far there have been three rallies in support of the workers’ cause. The last rally was held on Labor Day, and several hundred union members and supporters showed up to protest the layoffs. Medical students have cited concern not only for the fired janitors and their families in the current economy, but for the janitors who will be left to take on the work in place of those who were fired. Although an associate dean has claimed that the remaining workers “are not being asked to take on additional duties,” the cut of a third of the janitorial staff seems like a likely way to lower janitor morale and general cleanliness at the Medical School. That’s something that should be avoided on all of Harvard’s campuses, but that would be especially concerning at the campus charged with health and well-being.
Harvard Student Labor Action Movement members join with the medical students, SEIU members, and workers at all other Harvard institutions to ask that the layoffs not happen, and that the Harvard Medical School consider other more effective, more just avenues to make up the $40 million deficit. Without access to the information about the school’s operating budget and expenses, we can only hope that analysts will be honest and innovative in their efforts to do so.
As a non-profit institution that benefits from tax exempt status and incredible regional influence, Harvard has a responsibility not only to research and education, but to creating an economically just community that values even its sanitary workers as much as its prestige. To this end, please join SLAM and the janitors of HMS at a rally at the Harvard Club on Tuesday, September 17, at 5 p.m. to ask Harvard Club members to support the janitors facing these layoffs. Rallies and other forms of action will continue until Harvard Medical School agrees to respect all its janitors as valued members of its community.

The Business School’s recent initiative to root out gender inequality is not as useful as it may seem
Reading the recent New York Times article about gender equity at Harvard Business School left me with a protracted headache. The discussions reflected in the article, multimedia videos, and comments mostly seemed to revolve around whether or not the administration should have implemented an initiative to eliminate gender inequality in the first place, rather than accepting this as a given and critiquing the initiative’s methodology. But if we ignore these extremely basic discussions and start with the baseline that yes, gender is important and a source of systemic inequalities and no, in a general sense, it is not good to ignore gender-based achievement gaps in educational institutions, we are poised to address the problems with the initiative.
The most glaring problem with the initiative is that it seemed to be very focused on re-educating women about how to act, assert themselves, and make decisions about their lives. Women are constantly being taught that our normal, accustomed ways of behaving are somehow deviant and need editing. We always need editing, and if we want to be taken seriously this editing is usually supposed to result in us looking and acting more like men. Speaking softly is bad, not interrupting people if we want them to listen to us is bad, and not taking up more space than we need is bad.
However, I would argue that these traits are only seen as negative because they are the opposite of the corresponding masculine traits (speaking loudly, interrupting people, taking up space), and they are only detrimental to women because they allow women to be trodden upon if those women are in an aggressive environment. And the Business School is certainly an aggressive place. But it’s not necessary to force people to listen to you if they are respectful and thoughtful enough to voluntarily listen to you in the first place. This is why the program should have instead been focused on re-educating aggressive men, on teaching them to be quiet every so often and listen to what others have to say, to stop taking up unnecessary space (both physical and metaphorical), and to not assume that the words in their head are the most important words in the room.
If the administration fails to teach the men at HBS these things, regardless of what they teach the women, corporate culture will not shift. Aggression and domination will remain keystones of this culture, and will continue to manifest themselves in nasty ways. And women will continue be the butt of these manifestations, whether or not they have learned to be more aggressive, simply because that is how social narratives of male aggression run. Women are the proper targets. But if we work toward cutting out the centrality of domination in the corporate world, we might actually see changes in gender parity without requiring that women bear the brunt of that change.
But beyond questions of the initiative’s methodology, I want to resist the idea that diversifying oppressive and inequality-inducing institutions is ever going to make systemic and truly progressive change. For the same reason that I could never get properly excited about women being allowed to fight at the front lines in the military, I cannot get properly excited about gender diversity at the Business School.
Where gender disparity is concerned, I think the deeper question isn’t how to graduate more women from this school. The way to solve gender inequities in our country and wider world is not to strengthen the institutions that are forcing millions of women into lifetimes of labor for extremely small amounts of money, just as the way to solve gender inequity in our culture is not to push women to imitate men. Contemporary American corporations frequently work to dismantle labor unions, which are often the only real advocates for women who are being harassed, discriminated against, and mistreated in their workplaces. The growing power of corporations contributes to a culture of commodification where things like healthcare are seen as a product rather than a right, and poor women bear the brunt of this when they cannot afford contraception or other necessities for their reproductive health. Large corporations often go overseas for cheap labor and end up exploiting the largely female poor, as women make up 70 percent of all people living in poverty around the world.
When we are talking about Harvard Business School, we are talking about wealth. Period. So, while I hate to see gender inequality anywhere, I don’t think that having more women in Fortune 500 boardrooms who’ve been trained to ape aggressive men is going to significantly shift the sexism rooted our culture, or shift the deep, systemic gender inequalities tied to class that continue to put almost inescapable burdens on women around the world. Gender is a class issue. Gender is a race issue. Harvard Business School is built not only on the principle of inequality of admission—attendance for the select few—but on the principle that once students leave, they will aggressively continue to perpetuate national and international inequalities. So, we must ask, can such an institution really serve as a site of progress?

The Harvard School of Public Health has received a gift of $12.5 million which will support a significant revamping of the school’s curriculum, the school announced Monday.
The gift comes from the Charina Endowment Fund and two of the fund’s directors, Richard L. Menschel and Ronay Menschel. The money will go towards the establishment of the Transforming Public Health Education Initiative Fund, which will aim to support new degrees and a general reworking and modernizing of the school’s curriculum, the School of Public Health said in a release.
“This seminal...support facilitates and energizes our faculty and our school,” said Ian Lapp, associate dean for strategic educational initiatives at the School of Public Health. “This level of support is a strong endorsement of the school’s educational strategy.”
That strategy, Lapp said, was revamped three years ago, when the School launched a three-year plan “to assess and strategically revise” its curriculum in anticipation of its centennial, which is this fall.
Since the launch of the plan, called the ‘Roadmap to 2013,’ the School of Public Health has brought in about $18 million in support, said Lapp. In addition to the Charina gift of $12.5 million, the school has received gifts of $5 million from an anonymous donor to fund a new doctorate of public health degree, and $500,000 from the Medtronic Foundation in support of general curricular reworking, according to Lapp and the press release.
In addition to the new doctorate of public health—which has been approved by the School of Public Health and is set to launch in 2014—the recent outpouring of support has enabled the school to develop a Ph.D. in population health sciences. If approved by the School’s faculty and GSAS, the new program will be offered as early as 2016, according to Lapp. Additionally, the new gift will fund an enhanced curriculum for the master’s of public health degree, beginning in 2015.
“It’s very exciting because it allows the school to move really far ahead in the curriculum change business,” said Robert J. Blendon, senior associate dean and director of the division policy translation and leadership development, of the new gift.
Blendon, who is also a professor of public health in a position endowed by the Menschel family, noted that the gift would allow the school to introduce more case-based learning into its curriculum and to continue its movement into online education. Four of the courses currently offered on HarvardX, the Harvard subsect of the online learning platform edX, are from the School of Public Health, according to the platform’s website.
“This has been a clear strategic vision of our dean and myself and others to be in on the MOOC [massive open online courses],” said Lapp.
“This [support] is because [of the vision of] the Deans and the faculty [of the School of Public Health],” Lapp said. “This is an unprecedented gift and truly unprecedented funding for a school of public health.”

In Chinese ancient culture and tradition, a cricket may be captured and kept for good luck. In Molecular and Cellular Biology 80.1x: “Fundamentals of Neuroscience, Part I,” a popular introductory neuroscience class, a cricket may be captured and kept for neurobiological testing.
David D. Cox ’00, an assistant professor of MCB and computer science, is leading MCB80.1x, a new online counterpart to the Harvard classroom course MCB 80: “Neurobiology of Behavior,” as part of Harvard’s continually growing involvement in edX.
HarvardX, Harvard’s subset of courses offered through the free, nonprofit virtual education platform, has seen widespread success with courses like Computer Science 50x: Introduction to Computer Science. But MCB80.1x’s lab component—which includes the neural analysis of real life creatures like the cricket—is just one of the ways in which the new online class stands out from the pack.
“We’re trying to push the envelope on what we can do with an online course,” Cox said.
In addition to offering optional labs, MCB80.1x also features lectures filmed on-location and an online lesson format known as “guided interactivity.” Rather than deliver lectures in a classroom setting or lecture hall, Cox travels with a film crew to various scientific sites around Harvard and Boston to record clips for MCB80.1x.
Although only a portion of the semester-long course will be available online to begin with (hence the “.1”), Cox has already filmed segments in the Boston Aquarium, Harvard’s Museum of Natural History, and even in a Harvard Medical School Anatomy Lab, where he removed a human brain from a cadaver.
Richard M. Losick, the chair of MCB department, said that while half of edX’s mission is to draw an “audience that could be around the planet,” it also aims to enhance the experience of students enrolled in Harvard’s on-campus, term-time classes too.
Jeff W. Lichtman and Joshua R. Sanes, the MCB professors who teach the on-campus MCB 80 course with Cox, have promoted MCB80.1x as a resource for students enrolled in their class this fall semester.
“They introduced the fact that we would have online resources,” said Fola A. Sofela ’16, who is considering concentrating in Neuroscience. “It’s a great way to reiterate things that we learned in class and I think it’s going to enhance the class for people already taking it.”
Cox has been working on coding and designing the online course for about a year, with the help of freelancers around the world. His team includes everything from an illustrator in Thailand to a cartoonist in Tel Aviv to a composer in London, each helping to piece together the MCB80.1x online experience.
“At some level this is a big experiment at this point,” Cox said. “If we knew how it was going to turn out there would be no point in trying this.”

Boston Redevelopment Authority representatives addressed members of the Harvard-Allston Task Force and the Allston community on long-term planning proposals for the University’s development in Allston Monday night.
The urban planning proposals were designed to “activate" the area, with expected projects including further construction along North Harvard Street and Western Avenue as well as the creation of a “greenway” connecting Ray Mellone Park to the Charles River.
While these proposals are included in the Institutional Master Plan that Harvard submitted to the city in July, they would not be implemented during the 10-year plan the University hopes to see approved in October, according to University officials. That plan includes nine specific projects, such as the construction of a basketball arena, a hotel, and a conference center.
Instead, last night’s meeting focused on what could come after those developments.
According to BRA Chief Planner Kairos Shen, the point of the long-term plan is to ensure that “we’re heading someplace that is better than where we are today.”
Gerald Autler, the BRA’s senior project manager, added that the BRA hoped the master plan will force the University to begin the process of long-term planning.
“What we wanted to see was that [Harvard] had really done some systematic thinking,” Autler said.
The expanded long-term proposals, while still in their conceptual stages, drew mixed reactions from Allston residents and task force members.
The plan proposes buildings along the south side of Western Avenue that vary in height between 70 and 190 feet, increasing in the blocks closer to the river. Task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 said he took issue with the proposed heights.
“Are we looking at a canyon?” Whelan asked.
BRA senior architect and urban designer David Grissino responded that the tallest buildings would be set back from Western Avenue and that the heights would “step up” only as they approached the river, mitigating the effect of an “urban canyon.”
The long-term plan also includes an emphasis on buildings with ground floors devoted to public use, including floors fitted with retail shops. BRA representatives highlighted the importance of Harvard’s new construction projects being open and attractive to the public.
Task force members said they were skeptical of the success of this initiative.
“It’s so completely at odds with all our other experience,” Whelan said, referring to what he saw as the exclusive nature of other University developments.
Shen, the chief planner, emphasized the value of leaving the opportunity for new ideas in the future. But some task force members expressed a desire for the University to provide stronger commitments than conceptual proposals to long-term plans.
“I would like to see a commitment to the greenway,” said task force member and Harvard Kennedy School student Christina Marin. “I see that greenway as the greatest benefit to the community.”

Every fall, fewer than 40 students gain admission to the popular Harvard Kennedy School course Government 1796: “Central Challenges of American National Security, Strategy, and the Press: An Introduction.”
When on October 1 the Kennedy School launches HKS211.1x, the virtual version of the class and the school’s first ever HarvardX offering, the number of students in one semester able to earn some form of credit for the course will increase tenfold.
The course will be the second SPOC—small, private, online course—on HarvardX, the Harvard subset of the larger edX initiative, after HLS1x: “Copyright.” Like HLS1x, HKS211.1x will have a 500-participant cap.
The limit on enrollment makes the HarvardX course unlike most virtual classes, which are normally open to all and referred to as MOOCs—massive, open, online courses. Those who are admitted into HKS211.1x will be expected to complete weekly assignments and join discussion groups, with the potential to ultimately earn a Certificate of Mastery. Other edX users will be able to audit the course to explore the material for no academic credit.
The class is taught by Kennedy School professor Graham T. Allison '62 and David E. Sanger '82, a senior writer for the New York Times and former Crimson editor who took an earlier version of the course from Allison when he himself was a Kennedy School student.
“The reason why it is called ‘X,’ and it is a big ‘X’ in our case, is because this is an experiment. We are learning,” said Allison.
In particular, Allison said that he hopes the SPOC model will help combat the “highly discouraging” retention rates of MOOCs, which he estimated at around 10 percent. The application process, he said, will filter casual browsers from the students who are willing to make a bigger commitment.
Applications for the HarvardX course are due this coming Friday. If the number of applicants surpasses the 500 mark, the course team will apply some criteria and judge if the participant is prepared to write and perform strategic analysis in order to narrow down the pool, Sanger said.
“We have worried about the selection process. Our feeling is that when people have to actually look at the application, they will realize that the task requires several hours of reading and preparation. That will probably dampen the enthusiasm for those who are not serious in the first place,” said Allison.
According to Allison, the number of students every fall who express interest in taking Government 1796 frequently exceeds the class’s capacity. This past shopping period, approximately 100 Harvard undergraduates applied to win fewer than 10 spots.
“There was a huge demand, and we were hoping to make parts of it more widely available,” said Allison.
In an email to students who were not accepted to Government 1796, course assistant Jessica D. Blankshain wrote, “If you elect not to stay on the waitlist, or if the class remains full, I would encourage you to apply again next year if you will still be Harvard, or to consider the online version of the course.”
If 25 or more online participants were actually on Harvard’s campus, Allison said the course’s staff would try to facilitate an in-person section.
Frank G. Davis ’16, a College student who was put on the class’s waitlist and did not pursue the online alternative, said that for him, pure academic interest did not justify the time commitment required to complete the assignments.
“I wanted to take part in the course and learn the material, but if I was not getting any credit for it, I could not devote that time,” said Davis.
Davis, who received his lottery results 30 minutes after study cards were due, said that he was frustrated by the course’s enrollment cap for College students.
“If they have [the course] open to undergraduates, they should accommodate that a little better, or at least have more than six spots available,” said Davis.
Gregory C. Dunn ’16, a student also put on the waitlist who said he will apply again next year, said that the online course could stand as a reasonable alternative for some.
“I know that the staff behind it are extraordinarily talented. It will be a great opportunity for many people,” said Dunn.
Other universities in the edX consortium beyond just Harvard have begun experimenting with SPOCs. Armando Fox, an adjunct associate computer science professor at UC Berkeley who named himself as the first person to coin the SPOC term, said that the online version of his class CS169x: “Software as a Service,” arose from enormous interest in the on-campus version of the course.
“We had created the MOOC initially really as an experiment, because in our own campus course, we already had begun thinking about sophisticated online grading because of enrollment pressure,” said Fox.
Fox then created a separate online course open exclusively to UC Berkeley students.
“We realized that in order for this to serve as supplementary material for our on-campus students, those students would have different deadlines and grading policies. We accidentally discovered the situation,” Fox added.
At the end of the course, Fox said, student comments suggested that the MOOC material served as a positive enhancement, giving the course its highest rating in its 20-year history at Berkeley.
Two other courses at Berkeley, CS191x: “Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation” and CS188x: “Artificial Intelligence,” are also offered as SPOCs exclusively for Berkeley students.
As Academic Director of the Berkeley Resource Center for Online Education, Fox said that current efforts to create MOOCs or SPOCs are prioritized for already existing campus courses that either face over-enrollment or would benefit from incorporating the type of material that can be uploaded online.
“This is really about SPOCs. The MOOC is almost a side effect,” Fox said. “Institutionally, we want to make sure we are doing this  because we believe it can improve student and faculty engagement on our own campus. That’s our primary goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chinese history professor Peter K. Bol will assume the newly created position of Vice Provost for Advances in Learning, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in an email to Harvard faculty on Monday morning.
As Vice Provost, Bol will lead and coordinate two of Harvard’s prominent academic endeavors: the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, a presidential initiative launched in October 2011, and HarvardX, the University’s branch of the online educational venture edX, which offered its first classes last year.
“It has become clear that these efforts are central to the future of the university and that greater institutional support will help advance university-wide efforts to improve learning, ensuring that they are well-coordinated, strategic, and effective,” Garber wrote in the email, adding that he and University President Drew G. Faust designed the position following conversations with faculty, deans, Harvard Corporation members, and others in the Harvard community.
The selection of Bol comes at the heels of the appointment of a handful of administrators tasked with overseeing Harvard’s new educational initiatives. This past January, Colorado State University administrator Huntington D. Lambert was named dean of Harvard’s Division of Continuing Education, and in February, biology professor of practice Robert A. Lue was named the first faculty director of the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning.
Bol’s new position brings the total number of Vice Provosts to three—Jorge I. Dominguez, who oversees international affairs; Richard McCullough, who presides over research; and now Bol. The Provost’s office also includes a Senior Vice Provost, a Deputy Provost, and several Assistant and Associate Provosts.
Calling Bol a “pioneer in pedagogical experimentation, both online and in the classroom,” Garber wrote that Bol is “ideally suited to take on this ambitious and complex agenda.” Bol serves as chair of the Harvard Academic Computing Committee and developed SW12x: “China,” which he is teaching this fall. Bol is also director of Harvard’s Center for Geographic Analysis and sits on the HarvardX faculty committee.
In an interview with The Crimson on Monday, Garber said that the many hats Bol wears on campus makes him a perfect candidate to fill the new role.
“He’s been very sophisticated in his thinking about teaching and how to improve teaching and learning,” Garber said.
According to the email, Bol will work closely with several individuals across Harvard, including HarvardX faculty director Robert A. Lue, HILT director Erin Driver-Linn, and University Chief Information Officer Anne H. Margulies. Bol will also continue teaching, as the Vice Provost position is only half-time.
Garber told The Crimson that while the new Vice Provost position serves as the first formal connection between HILT, edX, and other pedagogical programming, their similar goals make it a natural relationship.
“Part of the thinking behind this position is that we have a number of activities whose common goal is to improve learning and teaching by various techniques and various approaches,” he said. “From the beginning, we thought that HarvardX is not really about technology. It’s about making the best use of technology to achieve goals that we’ve always had—to improve learning and teaching.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and parents of King Open School, a public elementary school in Cambridge, filled Monday’s Cambridge City Council meeting to raise awareness about the extreme temperatures in some of their classrooms.
During Monday’s meeting elementary school students complained that May, August, and September temperatures regularly range from 80 to over 100 degrees, creating an atmosphere that makes concentration difficult.
One former elementary school student noted that he thought the heat may have affected students’ scores for the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System—a standardized test administered in May to measure students’ abilities in mathematics, English, and various other subjects.
“We can’t leave the kids to the mercy of the weather,” said Xuemei Li, mother of a King Open School fifth-grader.
City Manager Richard C. Rossi explained that neither his administration nor the Cambridge School Committee have ignored this issue and will continue to try to resolve it, but that finding a solution has been difficult given the old age of the building.
Mayor Henrietta Davis, head of the school committee, observed that this problem is not unique to King Open School. According to Davis, 6 out of the 12 public elementary schools in Cambridge have no air conditioning.
“I was pretty shocked and aghast to learn that we were cooking our kids in classrooms,” said councillor Leland Cheung, echoing the dismay of his colleagues.
Councillor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom drafted a public order that was approved by the Council and requests a formal investigation of the issue.
“I am frustrated that this reached us. I think it sets a really bad signal to everyone involved, and I also think it portends a problematic future for other major building issues,” said councillor Craig A. Kelley. “This is not what we do, this is not what the building manager does, this is what the school committee does.”
Two other issues on the agenda that were approved were the allocation of funds to affordable housing and a new task force that will examine the wider consequences of the Connolly Petition—a petition for a ‘net zero’ building gas emissions future for Cambridge.
At the meeting, Davis declared October “Net Zero Emission Month” due to all the upcoming panels and meetings on the issue.

In the aftermath of Lawrence H. Summers’s withdrawal from consideration for the position of Federal Reserve chairman, several Harvard faculty members condemned the politicization of the confirmation process and expressed dismay over the decision.
“It is a sad outcome and a very bad precedent for future Fed chair appointments to have this one become a subject of public and political debate,” economics professor Martin S. Feldstein ’61 said in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Jeffrey A. Frankel said that Summers’s announcement had demonstrated how “the Senate confirmation process is broken.”
“President Obama should be able to have the chairman he wants, just like he should be able to have the Cabinet members he wants,” Frankel said. “And yet they and lots of federal judges and lots of other positions are very commonly blocked.”
In 2009, Obama appointed Summers to lead the National Economic Council, where he helped steer the administration through the nation’s worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Until Sunday’s announcement, Summers had been considered a frontrunner for the position of Fed chairman.
According to Richard J. Zeckhauser ’62, a professor of political economy at the Kennedy School, the controversy surrounding Summers’s candidacy will make potential candidates for similar appointments “less willing to serve.”
“It’s hard enough for the President to get the appointments through when they’re opposed by the other party. Usually almost every senator supports the president when [the nominee] is in his own party,” Zeckhauser said. “Now we’re going to start to have...ideological concerns within the party. It’s going to make it just an awful lot harder.”
Frankel said that several factors, including Summers’s economic philosophy, played a role in the politicization of the process.
“Some people appear to think that he would tighten monetary policy, raise interest rates, or stop quantitative easing,” Frankel said, adding that the role Summers played in deregulating financial markets during the Clinton administration may have led to opposition.
Zeckhauser, however, pointed to Summers’s focus on evidence rather than ideology in policy-making and said he believes that even Summers was unsure of his potential platform.
“I don’t think that the people who opposed him know what he would have done, because I don’t think that he knows what he would have done.” Zeckhauser said. “One thing that’s clear is that his policies would have been really empirically grounded.”
Frankel referenced Summers’s history at the University—in particular, controversial comments he made regarding womens’ aptitude in the math and sciences—as a potential reason for his withdrawal. Summers resigned as University president in 2006, almost one year after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences passed a vote of no-confidence in his leadership.
Of the professors interviewed, most expressed the opinion that Summers, had he been confirmed, would have been more than qualified for the position.
Frankel called Summers “very well-qualified” for Fed chairman, and Zeckhauser said the former Treasury secretary would have been “superb” in the position. He added that Summers’s experience in the “cauldron of policy-making” placed him apart from the other candidates.
“[Summers] would have been a great Fed Chairman too, but we’re happy to have him as a colleague,” said political economy professor Marc J. Melitz.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After crossing the finish line first in the annual Harvard-Yale dual cross country meet during his sophomore season, James Leakos took second place in the event as a junior. On Saturday, the current senior once again topped the field with a convincing 18-second victory in the men’s race. And for junior Viviana Hanley in the women’s race, a victory meant something different—it was the first win of her Harvard career.
“Viviana had a great run—she led from start to finish and took control of the race with a really fast first mile and was able to cruise knowing the team had secured the victory and she had done her part,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was a great way to [earn her first career victory] against our historic rivals, especially since they beat us last time out.”
Hanley recognized that her mentality going into the race was one of the main drivers of her success and recognized the significance of her personal accomplishment.
“[The Harvard-Yale meet] was exciting, it was definitely a confidence booster and it was cool to go out there with the team and have everyone do well,” Hanley said. “As an upperclassman now, there’s more pressure, but also more potential…. I tried to use that in a positive way and went out into the race more confident than I had in the past [knowing] that I could potentially take the win.”
Even though Hanley led for entirety of the run, her winning mark of 17:56 outpaced the closest competitor by only a single second. A strong finish line push ensured that the Crimson women could put the past two years’ losses to Yale in the rearview mirror.
Complementing Hanley on the men’s side was Leakos, who led the way with a time of 23:32, 18 seconds ahead of classmate Maksim Korolev. The Crimson men swept the top five spots in the race en route to a convincing 15-42 victory.
After passing out following his first Harvard-Yale meet, Leakos has won the meet two of the past three years, improving his personal best time at the race by 49 seconds over that span.
“[After Saturday’s race,] physically, I was exhausted, as always, and crashed through the line, stumbled through the chute, collapsed on the grass. I felt mainly relief at first, to be finished, and then elation and excitement as I watched the guys come in,” Leakos said.
According to Saretsky, the team’s pre-race plan was to have a strong start, and push the pace in the middle of the race.
“[I was] really pleased with the way James competed today,” Saretsky said. “James has had a great time recently…. He’s very focused on having a great senior year and really just getting back to enjoying every day and pushing himself. This [race] can really be an important stepping stone for him for where he’s trying to go later in the season.”
Both Leakos and Hanley worked hard in the offseason to improve their strength and conditioning.
They cited their commitment as the main factor in explaining the early season success they have enjoyed and hope to build upon.
“Though [the season has] technically [just] started, I’m really about three and a half months into a six-month season,” Leakos said. “I’ve been building my mileage up ever higher, and the workouts just keep getting faster. I felt a lot of miles behind me on Saturday, and only five in front of me.”
After recording a 18:10.15 mark in last year’s Harvard-Yale race, which was good enough for 11th in a field of 29, Hanley set out to push herself  even further and develop into an elite college runner. , The results have been overwhelmingly positive thus far.
She placed 20th in the NCAA Division I Northeast Regionals, then 118th at the National Championship in Lousiville, Ky. this past November. The summer also provided Hanley the chance to prepare to reach for even higher goals.
“I trained pretty hard this summer and the whole team has been pushing me,” Hanley said. “[The NCAA Division I National Championship] was an absolutely incredible experience and we definitely are hungry to go back this year and do a lot better than we did last year—[the Harvard-Yale meet] is just like a stepping stone to get there, though every meet matters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The life of an NFL rookie isn’t easy. Just ask Kyle Juszczyk ’13.
The former star tight end for the Crimson was forced to suit up against his hometown team Sunday as his Baltimore Ravens hosted the Cleveland Browns. Juszczyk grew up in Medina, Ohio, just 40 minutes south of Cleveland.
But trying to beat the team he had always rooted for is just the most recent challenge Juszczyk has faced as a pro football player.
After a good pre-draft visit with Ravens, Juszczyk thought Baltimore would be his most likely landing spot in the NFL draft.
He was right. The Ravens selected the Harvard product in the 4th round, 130th overall.
Baltimore coach John Harbaugh, who happened to coach under current Crimson coach Tim Murphy at Cincinnati, was up-front with Juszczyk about what his role would be on the team. Juszczyk had mainly played tight end in college, but he understood he would have to learn a new position to succeed in the NFL due to his physical attributes.
“They told me right away what they had planned on using me for,” Juszczyk said. “From the very beginning it was a multi-dimensional thing. They wanted me mainly to play fullback but they were going to use me at H-back and tight end too, and special teams as well was always going to be a big part of it.”
Juszczyk had just a week between the draft and offseason workouts, mini-camp, and organized team activities. The jump from the Ivy League to the NFL was a big one.
“The only thing that kind of caught me off guard was the time commitment,” Juszczyk recently told The Baltimore Sun. “I realize there would be a large time commitment, but I never realized how large.”
Juszczyk said the thing that he’ll remember most about training camp was how rigorous it was.
As a fourth-round pick, he was likely to make the final 53-man roster, but it wasn’t guaranteed. Two fellow fourth-round picks from the 2013 draft were cut before the regular season.
“Really, I’ll just remember the grind,” Juszczyk said. “You don’t get any breaks as a rookie.”
But Juszczyk was able to lean on two Pro-Bowlers, Vonta Leach and Ray Rice, for help.
Leach is a three-time All-Pro fullback, one of the best in the business. Rice, a running back, was recently ranked the 13th best player in the NFL on NFL.com
“I’ve had a number of good mentors,” Juszczyk said. “Vonta Leach has been a big mentor for me…. He’s definitely taken me under his wing.”
Juszczyk added that he turned to Rice a lot this offseason, especially when Leach wasn’t with the team while working out a new contract.
But the veterans have also had some fun with the rookie.
In a meeting last week, coaches were going over the team’s hand signals. When they got to a play Juszczyk knew as “Beijing,” the rookie was confused when coaches said the signal for that play was rubbing your head.
Juszczyk spoke up, asking how rubbing your head could signify the Chinese capital.
“That’s that Harvard thinking right there,” someone joked.
It turned out the play was called Begin, as in the hair care product.
A day before his first NFL preseason game, Juszczyk tweeted a picture of a Chick-Fil-A receipt. As the rookie, it was customary for him to pay for all of the running backs and fullbacks. The total came out to just under $100.
“#RookieObligations,” Juszczyk tweeted.
But all the trouble proved worth it the following night when the Ravens took on Tampa Bay.
Since entering the NFL, Juszczyk still hasn’t been more nervous than he was in the run-up to that night’s game, he said. And that includes his official NFL debut on national television in the season’s kickoff game against Denver.
Juszczyk overcame his nerves against the Buccaneers and impressed his coach while playing special teams. Harbaugh said as much to Juszczyk when the rookie came off the field.
“Coach Harbaugh came over to me and basically told me ‘You can do it. You are good enough at this level to make plays,’” Juszczyk remembered. “That was really reassuring.”
Juszczyk also enjoyed a special moment before the game.
Standing in the locker room, the rookie took a moment to look at his jersey. Throughout high school and college, he had never had his name on the back of his uniform. But here, above a big 4 and 0, were eight letters, all capitalized:
“JUSZCZYK”.

For the Harvard women’s rugby team, Tuesday night’s opening match against Quinnipiac has been thirty years in the making.  Having played for the last three decades as a club squad, this game will be the first time that the team’s members take the field as varsity athletes.
“There’s a lot of excitement on the team, a lot of enthusiasm and focus for this first varsity match ever,” co-captain Xanni Brown said. “We’re very excited, and we’re very focused.”
This promotion in status was a dream come true for the Crimson. However, Harvard did not spend much time celebrating. The squad has been rigorously preparing for the upcoming season, which kicks off tonight against the Bobcats.
Thanks to its new varsity status, the team has been able to up the intensity of its training this preseason, which they hope will translate into success on the field during Tuesday’s match.
Acquiring the new varsity title meant the Crimson got to implement a much more standard practice schedule. Daily workouts and weightlifting have been crucial in getting Harvard to a stronger starting point than ever before. With Quinnipiac set as the first target, the team is zeroing in on its opponent.
“We’ve definitely been preparing specifically for the team that we’re playing,” senior co-captain Brandy Machado said. “We plan on utilizing our strengths and taking advantage of their weaknesses.”
The entire team is going into the opening game with minds set on starting their varsity career with a bang. However, the Crimson is not just looking for a conference win, as the squad has eyes on future success this season. Harvard has set its goals high, hoping to ultimately clinch the Ivy League title at the end of the season, which has eluded the team for the past two years.
“There are some teams in the Ivy League that we want to crush on the way to an Ivy League Championship,” Brown said.
The Crimson hopes to be competitive at the national championships this year as well.
“We want to be one of the best, if not the best, in the nation,” Machado said.
The first step in the team’s quest for national success is its test against Quinnipiac Tuesday evening.
The Bobcats are a formidable opponent led by All-American Natalie Kosko, who racked up a team-high 85 points last season. Newcomer Maggie Myles is another offensive force in their lineup. The Bobcats placed third at the USA National Rugby Championships last year and finished their 2013 season with a record of 15-1.
Harvard will look to its three co-captains—lock Machado, full back Brown, and 8-man/flanker Ali Haber—to help the squad to victory. The three seniors have been on the club team for the past three years.
But victory is not the only thing on the Crimson’s mind as it kicks off the season.
As the first Ivy League women’s rugby team to be named a varsity squad, and as one of only six varsity teams in the country, Harvard hopes to set the standard for women’s rugby teams nationwide.
“People are looking at us to set an example... We want more girls to have this opportunity,” Brown said.
However, the change in status has not changed the foundations that the team was built upon. The current team members are looking forward to carry on the tradition that has been laid down by their predecessors.
“We already have a rich history and legacy, so a lot of it is making our alums proud of where we’re going,” Machado said.
The Crimson will enter the game with a multitude of goals in mind and a desire to further the sport they love through success on the field.
“We want to win, and we want this sport to be as big as possible,” Brown said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sailing started its season with a splash as the team finished in the top five for three of its four regattas this weekend.  The Crimson, which ended last season unable to qualify for nationals, displayed improvement and promise in its first races.
Prior to this weekend, the Crimson was ranked 16th nationally. The four Regattas were hosted by Yale, MIT, Tufts and Harvard.
39th Harry H. Anderson Jr. Trophy
Harvard finished second overall behind Yale, the host of the Crimson’s first away regatta.
Sophomores Sydney Karnovsky and Andrew Mollerus took 4th in the A division while sophomore Jacob Bradt, Junior Michael Drumm, and captain Isabel Ruane shared the responsibility for gaining first place in the B division.
Racers competed in both FJs and 420s. The weather conditions down in Connecticut turned out to be incredibly variable over both days.
“Throughout all the variability, it was still good to see that we stayed consistent in our results throughout the regatta,” Drumm said. “There wasn’t a lot of winning in some races and losing badly in others; we were focused on staying in the top-five.”
Tony Deutsch Trophy
The Crimson placed in its worst position all weekend in this women’s in-conference regatta hosted by MIT. Only FJ racing took place on this two-day competition.
While No. 5 Boston College and No. 17 MIT took the first and second spots respectively, Harvard finished up in seventh place with 256 points. Senior Caitlin Watson and sophomore Kristina Jakobson competed in the A division where the Crimson finished in sixth. Sophomore Sophia Bermudez and junior Ashleigh Inglis placed seventh in the B division.
“The team as a whole definitely needs to work on starting,” Mollerus said. “We go from sailing on rivers, where the water is much choppy to more open waters, away from the coast, and the game changes a lot. We need to be more disciplined in practice, we need to work on starting and we need to be more consistent.”
Although no protests were filed, the wind was shifty for most of the day on Saturday. Despite the calmer airflow on Sunday, there were several abandoned starts.
Lark Invitational, Central Series 1
No. 10 Tufts, the host of this Invitational, took three of the top five spots in this in-conference regatta. Competition took place through both FJs and Larks. Harvard finished up in fifth place overall with 225 points.
Due to the wind, there were two protests in Saturday’s competition, but none came through on Sunday.
Junior Richard Bergsund and freshman Karen Kennedy placed fourth in the A division while captain Ames Lyman, junior Ansel Duff and sophomore Hajar El Fathihi took third in the B division.
Although he didn’t compete in this regatta, Bradt felt strongly about how the team has changed compared to last year.
“We’re a little more confident because it comes with experience and with age,” he said. “The people that sailed this weekend had enough experience under their belt for them to feel ready to compete.”
Harvard Invitational
The freshmen on the Crimson proved most resilient in this home regatta on the Charles Sunday.
The in-conference competition consisted solely of FJs. Freshmen Matthew Mollerus and Emma Wheeler took first and sophomore Matthew Clarida and freshman Victor Kamenker took fifth in the A division.
In the B division, the strength of the freshmen really showed. Five freshmen and sophomore Adam Brodheim collected the fourth and sixth positions.
“We had a bunch of freshmen do well and get experience in their first regatta,” Drumm said. “Overall, it was a fun weekend.”
“We saw a big improvement from last year,” the older Mollerus added.  “[This weekend] we all went through and did what we had to do. “

Oh, Tuesday. It’s hardly the most inspiring day of the week, but with some cool events going on around campus today (including Flyby’s first comp meeting) you can definitely find a way to make it just a little bit more fun and fabulous!
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
It looks like summer might finally be over (not as over as we are about classes being a real thing again though). Temperatures will be in the mid 50s for most of the day—a cool and crisp almost-fall day. Additionaly, the moon will be waxing gibbous tonight, whatever that means.

For most Harvard students, dorm and house life make up a large part of the undergraduate experience. Freshmen are required to live on-campus, and very few sophomores, juniors, and seniors choose to live off-campus…but the reasons are there.
 
During the 2012-13 school year, only 120 students lived off-campus in non-University housing. Students interviewed by The Crimson cited a variety of reasons for their choice—some wanted more independence, others wanted to be able to cook for themselves, and one wanted the freedom to drill holes in a wall in order to set up a hammock. Other concerns included noisy neighbors and suffocating on-campus culture.
 
Being surrounded by people you know is not always wonderful. Seeing the same people every day can result  in a friend group made up of weak bonds only kept alive by the occasional wave and nod of the head. Sam Mendez, a senior at Harvard, remarked: “I dislike being surrounded by so many acquaintances. I feel it can inundate me and become an obstacle in the way of forming tighter bonds.” 
 
However, on-campus life is largely a matter of choice. There are no penalties for not attending any of the hundreds of events one gets emailed about. You can go to one intramural soccer game, all of them, or none of them. Some never eat in the dining hall while others can be found there every hour of the day.
 
Despite the worries voiced above, more than 97 percent of Harvard students live on campus. It is not hard to see why on-campus housing is so popular—few want to be away from the action. Many of the events that make up Harvard’s social and academic life are engineered around the housing system, including seasonal formal dances and student-faculty dinners.
