After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Ten thousand men and women of Harvard have spoken against the hateful event scheduled to take place tonight at Memorial Hall. Students, alumni, parents, and friends of the Harvard community are outraged, embarrassed, and, more than anything, deeply saddened that Harvard has permitted the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club to host a reenactment of the Satanic “Black Mass” on campus. This ritual is explicitly intended to parody the Catholic Mass in the most offensive way possible. Historically, black masses have involved desecrating the Eucharist, which Catholics believe is the real body of Jesus Christ, by placing it on the genitals of a naked woman, urinating on it, and slitting an infant’s throat to pour blood over it.
Early reports from Patheos stated that the Cultural Studies Club “have obtained and will use a consecrated host during this ‘re-enactment’” based on a conversation with the group’s PR director. This would need to have been obtained illicitly from a Catholic church for their purposes. However, the most recent statement released by the Extension School has recanted and assured the public that the ritual will involve an ordinary piece of bread. Conflicting reports have continued to emerge. On Wednesday Undergraduate Chaplain Fr. Matthew Westcott urged parishioners at St. Paul’s to consume the host in front of the priest and ministers to ensure the safety of our most precious religious practice. Actions intended to inspire such fear among the Catholic community have no place among our tolerant and “welcoming” Harvard.
Even if the members of the Satanic Temple do not employ a consecrated host, there are a number of problems with the desecration of Catholics’ most important sacrament. As some alumni have been bold enough to mention, Harvard would never allow a reenactment of the burning of the Quran for the sake of religious or free expression, or even education. While the Satanic Temple rejects the idea of the supernatural and does not believe that their actions have metaphysical implications, we believe they are summoning true evil into the heart of campus and thus, like the Archdiocese of Boston, revile it. In fact, they are inviting the prince of darkness to sit among the most vulnerable of our community, the freshmen, in the safe space that they use to eat, socialize, and study. Furthermore, they are cowards—if the Satanic Temple were seeking to truly foster campus dialogue, they would not have chosen this time when students are busy and stressed with finals. We are saddened that our last days on campus as seniors will forever be tarnished by Harvard sanctioning hateful acts against the most important thing in our lives: our Catholic Faith.
 
As Harvard Catholics, we completely reject the educational pretenses under which this event has been sanctioned. The Cultural Studies Club and the Extension School’s original statement emphasized that, as part of a series of events including “a Shinto tea ceremony, a Shaker exhibition, and a Buddhist presentation on meditation,” the club is presenting an educational effort to “explore different cultures.” The Satanic Temple, which is really behind this particular event, is a religious community guilty of greater fundamentalism than any group it intends to mock. Any notion that the Satanic Temple is simply a cultural group is nonsense. 
Many of our friends and the leaders of various campus fellowships, such as Harvard Christian Faith in Action, the Latter-Day Saint Student Association, Christian Impact, and the Harvard Islamic Society, have shown support for us in the Catholic community at this difficult time. For that, we are unspeakably grateful. Others, like responders over House lists and trolls on Facebook, have only added insult to injury by saying that that the Church deserves this hatred. As followers of Christ under the leadership of Pope Francis, we can only hope that such responses come from ignorance rather than malice.
In response to this event, the Harvard Catholic community has rallied around three petitions that together have already gathered 40,000 signatures. At the current pace, the group of undergraduates who organized the petition expects the number of signatories to grow to 50,000 by Monday afternoon. We are presenting the petitions to University President Drew G. Faust with the hope of having the event cancelled. Regardless, we will unite in prayer and solidarity. Our friends at MIT will lead a Eucharistic Procession to St. Paul’s Parish in Harvard Square, where the Harvard Catholic Community will host a Holy Hour from 8 to 9 p.m. This is a time of prayer for those who seek to persecute the Church and the University that has allowed it. The only response to such overwhelming hate is that of Christ Himself: love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
No one wants to talk about Asian-Americans in the affirmative action debate. With the recent ruling that upheld Michigan’s ban on affirmative action, the divisive pushback by Asian-American political leaders and interest groups regarding the reinstatement of affirmative action in California, and the unsettling “Harvard Not Fair” campaign that seeks to capitalize on the insecurities of rejected applicants based on race, one thing is clear: Asian-Americans are left to converse in the backroom during any nationwide discussion on affirmative action.
As Asian-Americans, our placement in the affirmative action debate puts us at an unfair disadvantage against everyone but ourselves. Why is this? Because people on both sides of the affirmative action debate oversimplify the Asian-American experience to suit their needs. Asian-Americans are cast as the “unexplained minority exception” in the cost-benefit analysis of who “wins” and “loses” in affirmative action.
Many today feel uneasy when talking about Asian-Americans and affirmative action—and understandably so. In an education system that witnesses Asian-Americans comprising 38 percent of UC undergraduates and boasting the highest high school graduation rate of any race in the country, many speculate: Are there “too many” Asian-Americans in our education system today? Is it a disadvantage to be Asian-American in the college admissions process? Is it harder to get in?
Asian-American students in today’s education system share the anxiety. Princeton researcher Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford of RTI International found that Asian-identified students had to score 140 points higher on their SATs to gain admission to prestigious colleges compared to white students. Espenshade’s statistics are even more striking when comparing the admission rates and test scores of Asian-American students to students of other minority backgrounds.
But instead of constructing an objective reality of the college admissions process, Epenshade and Radford’s statistics have intensified competition among minority students who have no choice but to view college admissions as a zero-sum game. The statistics have diverted attention from the greater issue at fault: a debilitated education system that fails to account for racism, historical oppression, and ethnic diversity.
When looking closely at the anti-affirmative action legal effort Harvard Not Fair, one thing becomes clear: It did not originate from the Asian-American community. Lawyer Edward Blum, who launched Harvard Not Fair and its two sister websites, UW Not Fair and UNC Not Fair, is a veteran opponent of affirmative action. Blum uses stock images of Asian-Americans as racial mascots with the inciting lines, “It may be because you’re the wrong race.” The implication is clear: this exploits the insecurity of Asian-Americans during the college admissions process in order to carry out an attack on affirmative action.
Using Asian-American faces and stories in anti-affirmative action efforts unfairly creates competition and division among minority communities. This year, three Asian-American legislators withdrew support for the California affirmative action Proposition 209 after public criticism from the Asian-American community. In response, a number of black and Latino lawmakers and interest groups have withdrawn endorsements for Senator Ted Liu, a Chinese-American facing another Democrat in his congressional race. Black and Latino assembly members also withheld votes from unrelated legislation regarding the state’s carpool system by Assemblyman Al Muratsutchi, a Japanese-American Democrat from Torrance.
The United States is quickly becoming a country with a majority-minority population, but white students still comprise over 60 percent of the college student population. As minorities, why do we have to fight over spots in the college admissions process when the “majority” refuses to budge in the first place?
The view of Asian-Americans as a “privileged minority” ignores the internal class differences that exist among sub-groups under the Asian-American umbrella. Southeast Asians drop out of high school at alarming rates: Nearly 40 percent of Hmong Americans, 38 percent of Laotian Americans and 35 percent of Cambodian Americans fail to finish high school. These sub-groups similarly face alarming percentages of poverty well above the national average, with Hmong Americans displaying a of 37.8 percent poverty rate—the highest among all sub-groups within the Asian-American community.
We as Asian-Americans cannot afford to pit ourselves against other minority groups by buying into rhetoric of college admissions as a zero-sum game. We cannot subscribe to the idea of the “Asian-American whiz kid” and disregard the significant disparity that exists within groups of the larger Asian-American community. We cannot ignore individuals who, in spite of identifying as Asian-American, still struggle to obtain a higher education and better future.
We cannot let the anti-affirmative action debate, framed by those who have historically benefitted from the current education system, rupture our solidarity with other people of color.
Hand in hand, we as Asian-Americans and other minority communities must together frame the affirmative action debate among ourselves.
It is up to us, not them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On Monday, members of the Harvard Extension School Cultural Studies Club will host a “black mass” with help from the New York-based Satanic Temple. While it is truly distressing that these groups are conducting an event so hurtful to a major portion of the Harvard community, we support the University’s decision to condemn the actions but allow the students to exercise—however tastelessly—their right to express and assemble themselves. 
Extension School Dean of Students and Alumni Affairs Robert H. Neugeboren ’83, struck the right note in his public statement, at once acknowledging the students’ right to free expression but at the same time condemning their crass approach.  “We do not agree with the student group’s decision to stage an event that is so deeply disturbing and offensive to many in the Harvard community and beyond,” Neugeboren wrote. “While we support the ability of all our students to explore difficult issues, we also encourage them to do so in ways that are sensitive to others.”
We acknowledge that a student group can and should have the right to operate as it desires within the confines of the law and University rules. Prohibiting the demonstration would be incompatible with the spirit of autonomy and intellectual engagement fundamental to a university setting.
At the same time, a demonstration that deeply disrespects the core beliefs of other students is antithetical to any sense of community. The hurt the event will cause has no place at Harvard, a place for respectful dialogue, not inconsiderate noise. The organizers have a right to hold this event, but they also have a responsibility to use their rights thoughtfully and respectfully. In this case, their misguided decision to go ahead with this event has overshadowed their professed purpose.
If the Cultural Studies Club genuinely desires to foster educational discussion, there are other, less offensive routes that the club could take. For example, the club could instead host a lecture on the historical context of the back mass, or even have members of the Satanic Temple come to discuss their practices. It is suspect that the Cultural Studies Club instead chose the route that would cause the most hurt to their peers. We fail to see what unique and essential educational goal is met by the staging of the “black mass” that could not have been met with a mere discussion of its history. 
We urge the club to reflect deeply on their actions, and to ask themselves why, if they only seek to educate rather than to practice a faith they actually believe, they have chosen to stage an event so egregiously contrary to basic decency. 
It is in times of distress, however, that we must hold firm to our culture’s beliefs of free expression. Urging the University to forcefully shut down the event would run counter to Harvard’s principles of tolerance and open discussion. Instead, we support the Catholic and Christian students in their peaceful response, which will consist not of violence or ad hominem attacks, but rather of prayer. We also appreciate the administration’s commitment to an open forum for diverse ideas. 
Hopefully, this unfortunate situation will be a time for members of the University to gather together in solidarity and respect for each other. The multi-denominational Harvard Chaplains—which include representatives from major Western and Eastern religious traditions, as well as atheistic, agnostic, and questioning members—have released a statement asking for “open and honest, but also respectful” dialogue. 
We hope the University community can gather together against unnecessary displays of hate—whether related to religion, race, or sexuality—and join in allowing but not condoning the actions of this group.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Your article about the Student Labor Action Movement’s calls for Harvard University to cut ties with Teach For America (“Student Activist Group Calls on Faust To Sever Ties with TFA,” Sept. 28, 2014) unfortunately missed an opportunity to present the perspectives who were criticized—the countless TFA alumni now pursuing graduate degrees here at Harvard.
If SLAM members are concerned that TFA alumni only “want to teach for a few years and then go to law school or business school” to pursue lucrative careers in other fields, let me assure them otherwise. I am fortunate to count many TFA alumni among my classmates at Harvard Law School, and I continue to be struck by how they are using their time here to acquire the skills and competencies necessary to fight the opportunity gap and economic inequality more broadly.
No, they are not leading a classroom anymore. But they are spending their summers in unpaid internships with organizations like the Education Law Center and NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund. They log hours in the Education Law Clinic here at Harvard, advocating for individual students touched by trauma to be given the tools they need to succeed in school.
They cross-register for classes at the Graduate School of Education and at Kennedy School that focus on education law and policy. They volunteer in local classrooms and meaningfully engage in communities like those they taught in through a whole host of student organizations and clinics.
My peers may have left their classrooms, but they have not left their students and their communities behind. Many of them—myself included—have come to law school in order to figure out how to better serve our students and their communities.
I do not disagree with some of the points made by SLAM. I do, however, urge its members to consider that having some TFA alumni move on to graduate school after time in the classroom is not a flaw of the organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am the Parkman Professor of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School, Director of the Center for the Study of World Religions, and a Roman Catholic priest. On all three counts, I am concerned about the plan for a black mass hosted by the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club on Monday, May 12.
The club explains: “Our purpose is not to denigrate any religion or faith, which would be repugnant to our educational purposes, but instead to learn and experience the history of different cultural practices. This performance is part of a larger effort to explore religious facets that continue to influence contemporary culture.”
If only the organizers had said more on which “religious facets that continue to influence contemporary culture” are highlighted in the performance of a black mass. This is, after all, a practice that, as far as its murky history reveals, seems often to have included the inversion and blaspheming of Catholic sacramental practice, as well as actual worship of Satan. Will these dimensions be present in Monday’s enactment? And what’s next? The endeavor “to learn and experience the history of different cultural practices” might in another year lead to historical reenactments of anti-Semitic or racist ceremonies familiar from Western history or parodies that trivialize Native American heritage or other revivals of cultural and religious insult.
Such events would surely raise legitimate concerns among all of us at Harvard; no one should be surprised if Catholics are concerned right now.
In response to the growing concern about this event, Robert Neugeboren, dean of students and alumni at Harvard Extension School, has said: “Harvard Extension School does not endorse the views or activities of any independent student organization. But we do support the rights of our students and faculty to speak and assemble freely. In this case, we understand that this independent student organization, the Cultural Studies Club, is hosting a series of events—including a Shinto tea ceremony, a Shaker exhibition, and a Buddhist presentation on meditation—as part of a student-led effort to explore different cultures.”
If only the University had managed to show that it recognizes the potentially great differences between “a Shinto tea ceremony,” “a Shaker exhibition,” and this black mass. It is too easy, and rather superficial, to compare a black mass with a “Buddhist presentation on meditation.” Why not present a Catholic presentation on the Eucharist? No one would have objected to that. All of us at Harvard should be able to understand why many on and around campus are greatly worried about the prospect of a black mass, possibly in parody of the Catholic Mass that is a living faith practice celebrated each day in congregations that include Harvard faculty, staff, and students.
The club also insists that “while a piece of bread is used in the reenactment, the performance unequivocally does not include a consecrated host.” It is remarkable that what we Catholics hold to be a precious sacramental reality has become big news at Harvard in May 2014. Since there is no empirical way to show that one host is consecrated while another is not—consecrated hosts do not glow in the dark—there is also no way for anyone but the organizers to know whether a host used in a black mass has been consecrated or not.
Yet the identity of one isolated host is not the only point. Also at stake is sensitivity to the faith of a community that believes in, shares, and worships around this sacramental sign. Catholics at Harvard should not have to be worrying about where Monday’s host comes from. And if it turns out that this week’s black mass proceeds on the quite different premise that “the supernatural” is in fact meaningless, then of course there can really be no question at all of a “consecrated” host for those involved—nor of a real God or a real Satan. In that case, ironically, even the black mass itself, stripped of faith and faith’s uncomfortable commitments, would end up being emptied of meaning, trivialized.
Most importantly, perhaps, this event raises a larger issue: As a university community we need to do better in handling matters of religious import. It is not enough to say that Harvard is a secular institution, as if living faith and practice matter only off campus or in private. We need to have, on occasion, difficult discussions that necessarily involve matters of faith and faithful practice. Sometimes these discussions will unsettle the University’s ordinary and smooth manner of proceeding. After the lawyers have spoken and free speech has been reaffirmed, and after we all agree that much is to be learned from the history of our religions, we still need to be able to talk together about the sometimes difficult reality of living religion at Harvard.
Not only is our humane and spiritual sensitivity at stake, but also our intellectual credibility. Shall we not see this event of a black mass on campus as a reason to convene a new and deeper conversation on how religions are alive, vocal, and unruly even at secular Harvard?

A committee tasked with reviewing the College’s resident dean position has recommended a change to the name of the role, reaffirmed that those appointed to the position should hold a Ph.D., and suggested that the deans continue to report to the dean of the College, among other points.
The review committee, which was convened last summer by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, has submitted its recommendations to Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister for approval, Pfister confirmed in an interview Friday.
Pfister said that he has several choices to make before signing off on the report—among them what exactly the position will be called—and that he plans to accept the recommendations by sometime within the next week. He was in the process of working on a memo to accept the report on Friday, he said.
Pfister said that the name of the position will change “in some way” likely to contain some variation of the words “House” and “dean,” but that he had yet to decide which option he would approve.
Pfister cited what he characterized as concern among some current resident deans that their current title implies “more student life and less academic and administrative oversight” as motivation for the proposed change.
If the proposal is approved, it would not mark the first time that the terminology for the resident dean position or its equivalent has changed. Equivalent administrators were known as Allston Burr senior tutors until the name of the role was changed to its current iteration in 2006.
According to Pfister, the committee reaffirmed the requirement that those serving in the resident dean position hold a Ph.D. Pfister cited the deans’ teaching role as a reason for why a Ph.D. is necessary.
“It’s very difficult to have a teaching position in FAS without a Ph.D.,” Pfister said.
The review committee also recommended that the resident deans continue to report to the dean of the College, as they have in the past, but clarifies that they may also report to his or her designee, according to Pfister. The report also includes “further affirmation that the resident deans also are responsible to the House masters,” Pfister said.
In addition, the review committee’s report addresses term limits and establishes specific review procedures for the position, Pfister said. Currently, resident deans are appointed to five-year terms with the possibility of renewal, but there is not an explicit limit on the number of terms a dean may serve. Pfister called the current term limit structure “nebulous.”
Pfister declined to say how many years or terms the deans would be able to serve under the proposal, but he said that deans will not be able to go on in the position “indefinitely.”
The review committee’s submitted recommendations follow a little over a year after revelations that administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of resident deans, which reignited a years-long debate over the administrators’ roles at the College. In the scandal’s fallout, administrators did not immediately clarify whether or not resident deans are faculty members and thus fall under the FAS email privacy policy, although Smith and then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds later acknowledged that the deans are considered faculty.
Adams House Co-Master Sean Palfrey ’67 suggested in October that the email search controversy in part prompted to the decision to review the resident dean position.

Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, who has served as the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since May 2009, will headline the School of Public Health’s centennial Commencement exercises on Thursday, May 29.
As the director of the CDC, Frieden has worked to extend life-saving treatment, prevent disease, and control infection in more than 50 countries.
On his CDC Director’s Blog last week, Frieden wrote, “The U.S. government and our international partners have an unprecedented opportunity to make the world—and ourselves—stronger and safer through our commitment to closer cooperation on global health issues.”
When appointed as CDC director in 2009, Frieden headed America’s response to the H1N1 influenza virus pandemic.
Frieden has supported programs that control tobacco usage and launched the first-ever nationally sponsored anti-tobacco media campaign.
Prior to working as CDC director, he served as the New York City Health Commissioner from 2002 to 2009. As commissioner, he worked on a variety of tobacco control efforts, including increasing taxes on tobacco, banning smoking from places such as restaurants and bars, and funding an anti-tobacco advertisement campaign. During his tenure, the number of smokers in New York City dropped by an estimated 350,000.
Frieden also made New York City the first place in the United States to remove trans fat from restaurants and require some restaurants to display calorie information. While he was commissioner, the New York City Health Department created the largest community electronic health records project in the country.

Most undergraduates are still asleep during the early hours of the morning when many of the Harvard University Dining Services staff begin their days preparing the meals for the College’s more than 6000 students.
For those who work in the kitchens, everything has to be done in advance to make sure that all that is required for each meal is on hand. Menus have to be tested, prepared, and revised many weeks beforehand.
Despite this preparedness, being a chef in the Harvard undergraduate dining halls also means being ready for the unexpected. Sometimes, a shortage of an important ingredient means revising the menu. Entrees can become so popular that they are finished long before the meal time is over, requiring the quick creation of a replacement dish. Other times, recipes have to be rearranged after discussions in weekly meetings in order to accommodate the ever-changing tastes of the student body and make sure it’s better the next time it appears.
Preparing the meals in all of the thirteen undergraduate dining halls seven days a week requires a carefully calibrated top-down effort, but it is also work of individual chefs, working on the ground and in the kitchens of each of Harvard’s Houses. Though these chefs vary in age, prior experience, and time at the College, they collectively work to meet the unique challenge of feeding a large undergraduate population and their varied tastes.
A MEDLEY OF BACKGROUNDS
Like Harvard students, the chefs that staff House kitchens come from many diverse backgrounds. No two chefs are alike and they arrive on campus with a wide assortment of stories and family histories, like chef Ted Smith, senior chef production manager at Quincy House and Hillel, who graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.
“I worked as a corporate chef for 15 years,” Smith said. “[I worked] at country clubs, city clubs, and moved on to Boston University for a few years.”
Many of the chefs have similar paths to Smith’s, albeit with a few alterations. Chef Donn S. Leonard, senior chef production manager of the Dunster-Mather kitchens, graduated from Johnson and Wales University.
 
“During school I worked at ten restaurants,” Leonard said in an early April interview at Harvard University Dining Services administrative offices on Winthrop St. “After graduation, I worked at the Marriott Corporation in the Health Department and rehab centers. Then I went on to New Horizons [at] Choate, Woburn retirement home for a few years.”
 
Leonard arrived at Harvard’s kitchens after his sister, who had worked for Harvard at the time, recommended that Leonard should apply to work for the University as well. Leonard was hired and started to work at Lowell House in 1995.
Some of the chefs claim even farther origins than just the United States. About one third of the head chefs and sous chefs working for Harvard University Dining Services are from outside the U.S.
Andrea van Wien, a sous chef at Hillel, is from Colombia. “I grew up in the kitchen with my family. I did restaurants and catering, then I went to Le Cordon Bleu, and I did some food development. I had always admired Harvard from all areas, and someone told me it was a great place to work so I came here and applied, and now I’m proud to be here.”
Arlene Richburg, originally from Trinidad and Tobago, is the chef production manager at Adams House and has worked for HUDS for about four years. In her family, with parents who were avid cooks, she said, “food was always an intricate part of growing up.”
According to Richburg, that family background has helped her cultivate her own love of cooking and baking. Richburg said her mother told her that her first word was ‘elicious’ because she could not pronounce ‘delicious.’ 
 
Richburg noted that it was her mother’s baking under difficult financial circumstances, that has inspired her in her own cooking.
 
“Coming from a third-world country it is always challenging; [not] having a lot of money to work with, so you do the best you can. And [my mother] got really creative with [food] so I always just looked to that,” Richburg said.
Still, Richburg said she was not always sure that she wanted to be a chef. Only after visiting Boston on vacation in the 1990s and falling for the city did she decide to move to the area and pursue cooking. After graduating from Brookline-based Newbury College in 1994, she started working at the Museum of Fine Arts, eventually moving her way up to become chef de cuisine or head chef there.
“It was in the restaurant upstairs [in the MFA], and I just about worked at every station in [those] seven years,” Richburg said. “I [had] worked with a lot of great chefs in that environment and I had learned a lot.”
FOOD PROFESSIONALS
After arriving at Harvard, adjusting to the environment after working in different establishments is not always easy, HUDS senior chefs said.
“The system implemented here which we use in our daily productions is called Food Pro,” said Leonard. “And it’s a very complicated system. That was one of the hardest things I had to grasp.”
For more than 15 years, HUDS has used the program Food Pro as a tool to estimate or “forecast” the amount of food they will need each day based on the number of people they think will eat and how much. Though this helps the chefs and the food suppliers in predicting how much of each ingredient needs to be sent to each dining hall and then prepared, the initial difficulties with using Food Pro were shared with all of the chefs.
“Where I worked for 15 years prior, I could pick up the phone and call the company that I needed to order something from,” said Richburg, of his previous employer. “I placed my orders at the end of the day or faxed them my order.”
For Harvard’s dining halls, though, orders have to be placed weeks in advance. While many say they found Food Pro initially challenging, the chefs interviewed for this story say they agree that the process helps by ensuring that each dining hall does not have to order food separately each day.
“It’s kind of like our Bible,” Richburg adds. “We live by it.”
For senior chefs, who oversee the staff of each dining hall, management is a time sensitive process that has to be repeated each day.
“We’re under a lot of time tables under the course of the day, making sure certain orders get ordered at certain times of the day,” said Smith. “It’s our responsibility to make sure that all of the food that is needed to serve any particular meal is available so our cooks and staff can be in place to do their jobs.”
FAMILY-STYLE SERVICE
Though each chef arrives on campus from a different background and with a unique history, senior chefs say they have come to appreciate the particular demands and community that comes with serving students.
“Coming from healthcare to here, it is a family atmosphere,” said Leonard. “Right there in the dining hall, that is where everything goes down. It’s a family-oriented place. We try to make our students and our employees feel welcome.”
Van Wien shares Leonard’s sentiments and said she feels that the chefs are able to have a close, familial type relationship with the students.
“[Students] will share their stories, not only around the food but their lives, what they’re doing,” said van Wien. “Some students are already telling us that they are missing us but they will soon come back to visit.”
Richburg recounts similar interactions with students. She recalls a time when a student broke her ankle and was having a rough time at the beginning of the semester. Because of the student’s injury, Richburg and her team decided to help out the girl whenever they could.
“One day she just came in and hugged me and started crying, telling us how glad she that we were taking such good care of her,” said Richburg. “I told her that was what we’re supposed to do for each other.” 
 
For Smith, the possibility of such interactions is what makes him glad that his application was accepted and that he was able to join an institution he believes is truly top-tier.  
 
“We were all handpicked to be here and it is an honor to be here,” Smith said. “What we do here is noticed by other colleges across the world, so it’s always fun for us to be always mentioned in something, somewhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: May 12, 2014, at 4:21 pm.
University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement earlier this morning that she affirms the right of the Harvard Extension School Cultural Studies Club to host a Satanic event involving a demonstration of “Black Mass” this evening, but strongly disagrees with the club’s decision to hold it.
 Faust added herself to the long list of people condemning the event, including members from the Archdiocese of Boston, Harvard Chaplains, student religious groups, and many alumni and students on campus. The event is still slated to take place this evening at Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub in the basement of Memorial Hall at 8:30 p.m.


“The decision by a student club to sponsor an enactment of this ritual is abhorrent; it represents a fundamental affront to the values of inclusion, belonging and mutual respect that must define our community,” Faust wrote. “It is deeply regrettable that the organizers of this event, well aware of the offense they are causing so many others, have chosen to proceed with a form of expression that is so flagrantly disrespectful and inflammatory.”
Still, Faust wrote, allowing the event to proceed is “consistent with the University’s commitment to free expression, including expression that may deeply offend us, the decision to proceed is and will remain theirs.”
Harvard University Police Department plans to have a “presence at the event,” according to the department’s spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, who said that he cannot discuss specifically the size of that presence.
 
The Cultural Studies Club has not indicated any intent to cancel the event. An email to The Crimson from the club’s account disagreed with Faust’s response.
“[Faust] is correct that [the black mass’s] historical origin was a means of denigrating the Church, but that was at a time when the Church was guilty of all sorts of horrific abuses,” the Club wrote in an email to the Crimson. To fail to take the context into account is completely disingenuous.”
The email added that while some people have expressed outrage at the event, there is no reason for the University to silence the Satanists. 
“There are members of the community who are offended by the Church for reasons they can articulate, yet groups are not making concerted efforts to silence Church rituals on that basis,” the email continued. “Offense, especially when it is not founded on best available information, is not grounds for silencing others in a pluralistic democracy.”
Although many members of the Harvard community have expressed concerns regarding the black mass, opposition is not unanimous.
Sarah E. Coughlon ’15 said that she supports the event, which she plans on attending because she is intellectually curious about Satanism.  Coughlon is interested in learning about the Satanic Temple, whose spokesperson, Lucien Greaves, talked earlier in the year to the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics undergraduate club. 
She added that she is distraught by the Harvard community’s response to the event. 
“I am deeply troubled by the assumption of illegitimacy… that this is inauthentic and only in spite of Catholicism,” Coughlon said, adding that she finds it interesting that “a powerful white religious group gets talked about,” but not every religious community gets a response from President Faust. 
Coughlon added that the efforts of the community to “delegitimize” Satanism are unwarranted. 
“The fact that something does not have the structural or institutional privileges to it that many religious groups do does not delegitimize it as a religious belief or religious group,” she said.
In an email confirming registration to the event last night, the Club wrote that it has hired increased security officers and has been “informed that additional security will be present and it is possible there may be protesters.” The club added that it will not tolerate any hateful or disrespectful individuals at the event. 
 “While we recognize that some people have taken offense, and that is regrettable, please be advised in no uncertain terms that this event was not conceived, intended, or designed as an expression of hate against any group,” the Cultural Studies Club wrote. “Any guest who makes denigrating statements against any group will be escorted off the premises. Likewise, anyone who attempts to disrupt the performance will also be escorted from the premises.”
The Club added that only those who registered for the event and can present an ID will be admitted. Also, it will not permit the use of cellphones during the event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 14, 2014, at 2:37 a.m.
Although the Harvard Extension School Cultural Studies Club dropped its sponsorship of a reenactment of a satanic “black mass” ritual earlier in the night, members of the New York-based Satanic Temple gathered for what appeared to be a black mass on the second floor of the Hong Kong restaurant and lounge shortly after 10 p.m. Monday.
About 50 people, mostly dressed in black and some wearing face makeup, were present for the ceremony. A consecrated host, believed by Catholics to be the body of Christ, was not used in the ritual.
Four individuals in hoods and one man in a white suit, a cape, and a horned mask were active in the proceedings, as well as a woman revealed to be wearing only lingerie. The ceremony began with a narration on the history underlying Satanism and the black mass ritual.
The restaurant’s owner, Paul Lee, said in a phone interview around 11 p.m. that he was unaware of the incident. The Hong Kong is located on Massachusetts Avenue, directly across the street from Harvard Yard.
The ritual came after the cancellation of a black mass reenactment organized by the Harvard Extension School Cultural Studies Club, which had the event scheduled for Monday evening in Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub in Memorial Hall. Shortly before the planned starting time, the club said that it was moving to an off-campus site, citing in an email that “misinterpretations about the nature of the event were harming perceptions about Harvard and adversely impacting the student community.”
The club wrote in its email around 5 p.m. that they planned for the event to be held at The Middle East nightclub in Central Square at 9 p.m. But Clay S. Fernald, the general manager of The Middle East, said Monday evening that the nightclub would not host the event, and that negotiations with the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club had fallen through.
Fernald declined to comment on why negotiations had ended.
Around 7 p.m., the Cultural Studies Club sent an email saying that they had been unable to find another location and would no longer sponsor the black mass, and individuals who intended to attend decided to migrate to the Hong Kong, at which the ceremony was revived.
Satanic Temple spokesperson Lucien Greaves said in an interview with The Crimson earlier in the afternoon that although the Cultural Studies Club cancelled the event, he still hoped to host a black mass in the future.
After learning of the event that occurred at Hong Kong,  Terrence Donilon, secretary of communications for the Archdiocese of Boston, said in an interview around 11:00 p.m. that the Diocese's position is the same. He said the event is disgraceful and despicable.
The Archdiocese followed through with its plans to host a Eucharistic procession to St. Paul Church, where a “holy hour” will be conducted. Donilon said that he was grateful for the community presence at the event and the presence of  University President Drew G. Faust.
CONTROVERSY AT HARVARD
The club emphasized in the 5 p.m. email that Harvard had not asked them to move the event from its previous location, the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub in the basement of Memorial Hall, and commended the University for affirming its members’ rights to free speech and assembly.
“Harvard always demonstrated that it understood its responsibility to defend protected student speech. That was always made clear to us,” the club wrote in a second email.
Extension School Dean of Students and Alumni Affairs Robert H. Neugeboren '83 also said in a statement after the relocation announcement but before the postponement that the Extension School “is grateful the student group has recognized the strong concerns expressed by members of the Harvard community and beyond.”
The proposed reenactment had received sharp condemnation by the Archdiocese of Boston, the Harvard Chaplains, a group of religious and spiritual leaders on campus, and several student groups.
In a statement released online on Monday, Faust affirmed the University’s commitment to free expression, noting that the club would be afforded the decision to proceed with the re-enactment, although she did deplore the event as offensive.
The Cultural Studies Club still said it was dismayed by harsh and widespread criticism of the event.
“While it is unfortunate that many people took personal offense at rituals for which they have little or no understanding of their context, what we find most disturbing have been the demands that the rituals and beliefs of marginalized members of society be silenced,” the club wrote in the emailed statement. “It is gravely upsetting to us that some people feel vindicated on the basis that they have disingenuously mischaracterized our invited guests as being part of a hate group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the weekend that the Harvard track and field program has been waiting for all season. As the team competed at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships Saturday and Sunday at Yale, their hard work certainly paid off.
Just as they did at the Indoor Heptagonal Meet, the women claimed the Ivy title with a final score of 162 points. The men’s team repeated a third place finish, ending the meet with 109 points behind first-place Cornell and second-place Princeton. The women’s title is only their second since the team began competing in the Heptagonal meet in 1979, with their only other victory coming in 1990.
Along with the women’s team title, eight Crimson athletes earned individual titles, while several others set personal bests or added their names to the record books.
Thunderstorms delayed day one of competition, but that didn’t slow down the men’s team, which topped the leaderboard at the end of Saturday’s events. One of the big players in putting them ahead was freshman Elliot Safo, who competed in the long jump competition.
Prior to Saturday’s competition, the men’s long jump record had not been broken since Babe Ruth was playing for the Yankees and lightweight crew at Harvard was in its inaugural season. Safo’s 7.73-meter jump was the first Crimson long jump victory since 1983 and upended Edward O. Gourdin ’21 and his 93-year old record.
“It’s critical for our program to have the freshmen be able to come in and step up the way that they have” coach Jason Saretsky said. “We are really fortunate [that] the types of student-athletes we are able to attract to the team…have the composure and the experience to go into this arena and perform at such a high level.”
Two other Harvard athletes also claimed individual Ivy titles on day one for the men. Junior Ben Glauser claimed victory in the hammer throw with a personal best of 63.71 meters, and was good enough for second all-time for the Crimson.
Junior Dean Sullivan was also victorious on the field, topping the podium in the javelin for the second year in a row. His throw of 67.99m puts him second in Harvard and Ivy League history.
Having finished day one in third place, the women needed the scores from day two to put them ahead in overall points.
Freshman Nikki Okwelogu continued her dominance by claiming the Heps shot put title with a throw of 16.09m. This personal best for Okwelogu was 1.31m longer than the previous Crimson record set by Nicole Carkeek ’91. The victory for Okwelogu along with a fifth place finish by senior Alysha Johnson and a sixth place finish by senior Adabelle Ekechukwu also allowed the women to clinch the overall Ivy title and put the other teams out of reach.
“In the past couple of weeks, my form has been coming together,” Okwelogu said. “I’m just glad it manifested in this meet where it counts.”
The field events, however, weren’t the only ones breaking records. On the track, junior Erika Veidis claimed the title in the 800m race with a time of 2:06.23 to become the first Harvard titleholder in the event since 1995.
The 4x100 relay team of junior Ashley Collinsworth, freshman Jade Miller, sophomore Autumne Franklin, and junior Danielle Barbian beat their own Harvard record and broke the Ivy League record with a time of of 45.4, less than a half a second faster than they did earlier this year.
Miller and Frankin added to the team’s individual titles in the hurdle events. Miller was victorious in the 400m hurdles with a time of 58.72. Franklin won her second straight title in the 100m hurdles with a time of 13.57.
“It was a fantastic weekend for Harvard track and field,” Saretsky said. “By my estimations, we are the best combined program in the Ivy League.”
