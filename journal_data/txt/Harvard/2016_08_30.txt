After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Los Angeles is a city of roads: noisy highways that stretch into the distance—long avenues that tangle up in knots—meandering streets that wind around mountains—dusty boulevards that sink into valleys. Roads connect and divide and define this endlessly sprawling metropolis.
Such a pedestrian-unfriendly town demands cars of its residents, but I am rarely one to follow the status quo. When I relocated to this palm tree-speckled paradise in June to intern at a television network, I made a distinctly modern, ultimately frugal decision: to commute via ride-sharing apps rather than renting a car.
I thus spent the past couple months engaged in a strange social experiment. Two or three or four times a day, I slid into a stranger’s car. I greeted a person whom I would have never met otherwise, and we cruised toward my office or my house or some other destination of choice. Then I offered a curt goodbye and exited the little universe we shared. Our time together, at once so intimate and yet so strange, came to an end; the app never, on any of my dozens and dozens of trips, gave me a repeat driver.
I met a whole cast of characters on my daily rides. There was the middle-aged guy who spelled out to me why a young woman might want to avoid riding alone in an older man’s Uber. I had not felt uncomfortable in his car up until that point; I sure did afterward.
There was the man who offered aphorism after aphorism about the goodness of humanity as we sped along the 10 to Santa Monica. In one particularly unexpected outburst, he passionately exclaimed, “People, man! People!”
There was the driver who, after noticing my destination in Burbank, asked me if I was a celebrity. I wish I had said yes.
There was the lady who draped her dashboard in handwritten felt signs that carried messages of female empowerment. She was one of the rare female Uber drivers I met this summer, and one of the even rarer drivers who spoke honestly about the challenges of driving for Uber as a woman.
There was the gentleman who, upon learning my name, shuffled through a messy stack of CDs, pulled out a shiny red one, and played a folksy love song about a woman named Emily. I was flattered, I suppose.
There were the many other folks with whom I drove in utter silence for thirty, forty, fifty minutes of clogged freeways and sunshiny vistas. Sometimes the radio filled the void—every driver from Laguna Beach to Glendale seemed fond of Kent Jones’ “Don’t Mind”—but other times the wind, crashing through windows, served as the drives’ only soundtracks.
We live in an insular world. Technology takes our attention away from the people in front of us; our own standoffishness and cliquishness make us wary of connecting with strangers. Ride-sharing apps force us, just through brief conversations, to consider the existence of people outside our regular orbits. I give that experience five stars.

To the editor:
What makes a building an icon? There are many factors: design, history, placement, or numerous and diverse people interacting with it on a regular basis. The Harvard Square Kiosk — home to Out-of-Town News — is one such icon. Today the Kiosk is facing a sizable threat to its distinctive historic features through renovation efforts to revitalize Harvard Square. The structure, completed in 1928, once served as Harvard Square’s main subway entrance. The Kiosk’s exuberant outward-curving wing-like copper roof evokes ideas of travel while sheltering waiting travelers. When a new subway entrance was built in the early 1980s, the Kiosk was relocated to its current site and became a highly sought-out locale for newspaper and magazine sales. Cell phones now carry much of this information and Out-of-Town News will close shortly.
What will become of the Kiosk? Hopefully we can add our voices to the decision-making process. For now, safeguarding its historic form is critical and rests largely with the preservation wording in its vendor’s lease. There is real concern that planned renovations will destroy core features, including much of the historic brickwork and iron detailing (designed to complement the nearby Harvard Gate by the famed architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White). Also envisaged is the replacement of the current windows with LED back-lit ground-to-roof plate glass. Designed originally as a visual bridge between the nearby historic brick campus buildings and the bustling movement of people and goods in the commercial district across the street, the Kiosk may lose much of its distinctive detail and character.
While it has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978, granting the Kiosk official Landmark status will protect it, so that future generations of Harvard students, Cantabrigians, and visitors can experience its iconic and historic form. Some proposed changes seem minor, but the iconic is found in the details. It may be hard to appreciate this in familiar buildings like the Kiosk, but when such details are eradicated, future generations will mourn their loss and wonder why preservation wasn’t self-evident.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mary (Buoy) Lee, the founder and matriarch of the Harvard Square landmark Hong Kong Chinese restaurant, a favorite haunt of students and locals alike for more than six decades, died on Aug. 17 in Cambridge. She was 90.
Lee died of a stroke, according to Paul Lee, her oldest son and the restaurant’s manager. In honor of Lee’s passing, the Kong, as the restaurant is affectionately known among Harvard students, closed on Aug. 25, the day of her burial. 
“She was always very strong, she was loving but sort of tough on us. She would always negotiate, always try to get better prices, she was very much a businesswoman,” Paul Lee said, reflecting on his mother’s life. “She was always pushing and thinking how can we do something better.”
Buoy Lee was born on Dec. 10, 1925 in poverty in rural Canton, China, the oldest of seven siblings. By the time she reached middle school, she was forced to abandon her studies to help take care of her family. At age 20, she immigrated to the United States to make a new life for herself. At the time of her arrival, she could not speak, write, or read English.
“I came over here, I didn’t know nothing, I was so scared when I came,” Buoy Lee told The Crimson in 2014 on the occasion of her restaurant’s 60th anniversary. “I was born in China poor—no money, no nothing. That’s why when I came here I didn’t mind working hard.”
Lee was an intelligent, warm, and elegant woman with a tireless work ethic, said Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
“It’s such a warm and wonderful memory that I have of Mrs. Lee,” Jillson said. “She cared about people and she worked really hard, but she was very kind and very giving and she was also very fierce… a strong, lovely woman.”
When they first settled in Massachusetts, Lee and her husband, Jimmy (Sen) Lee, jointly ran a laundry shop in Brighton. After walking past the Hong Kong’s current location on 1238 Mass. Ave. one day in 1954, however, Buoy Lee was inspired to open a Chinese restaurant on the property, which she said had “feng shui.”
At the time, Harvard Square was a poor business environment, with “nobody...walk[ing] around,” Buoy Lee said. Prophetically, she predicted Harvard Square would later become a “very busy place.”
Buoy Lee, her husband, and three other partners—none of whom as of 2014 held a share in the business—officially opened the restaurant in 1954. The Hong Kong was comprised of only a single dining room then, before eventually expanding to three floors.
Despite its small size, the Hong Kong was an immediate success. In 1956, at her insistence, Lee’s husband Jimmy was able to secure a bank loan and buy out the other partners. The restaurant has remained in family hands ever since, and is currently owned and managed by Paul Lee and his two siblings.
“She has a special place in the Harvard community,” Bill Bartley, the general manager of Mr. Bartley’s, a neighboring burger joint, said of Lee. “You think of the generations of people that [the Hong Kong restaurant] served, it takes strong leadership to keep that going, and Mrs. Lee has been part of that leadership for a long time.”
Buoy Lee leaves behind three children, eight grandchildren, and five great grandchildren. According to those who knew her, she also leaves a less tangible but equally lasting legacy in the Cambridge and Harvard Square area.
“People had first dates here, people met here and subsequently got married,” Paul Lee said, noting as well the numerous graduations and birthdays that have been celebrated at the restaurant. “I don’t think you could put in words how [the Hong Kong] has helped or affected the Cambridge community and also the Harvard community.”
Paul said he thought his mother would most like to be remembered in her role as hostess at the Hong Kong restaurant and as a friendly face for the customers entering over the decades.
“[She’d want to be remembered] as a person that you would see right at the front desk greeting you as you came in and saying ‘thank you’ and ‘have a nice day’ as you left,” Paul said. “She was always there, she was always saying hi to everybody, always talking to everybody.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to scheduling nonconference games, Harvard women’s soccer isn’t in the business of padding stats in easy early-season games. Instead, the team came out firing over the weekend, opening its 2016 campaign with a Friday night match against No. 10 UConn at Jordan Field.
The 90 minutes itself was a tough affair for the Crimson as the Huskies (3-0) outplayed the home team with a well-rounded performance to take a 3-1 victory and drop Harvard to an 0-1 start.
The result, however, was not necessarily one out of line with first-year head coach Chris Hamblin’s vision for a successful season.
“I think we gave a really good account of ourselves,” Hamblin said. “The first game of the year, coming in against a top-ten team…we knew that we were going to be tested. We want to be able to play good teams.”
The Crimson found a couple of bright spots in competing against a top-tier team. Freshman midfielder Maggie Basta tallied an assist and a shot on goal in her first collegiate game, while senior Rachel Garcia put home Harvard’s goal in the 66th minute for her fourth career goal with the Crimson. The score pulled the home team to within one goal after trailing 2-0 after the first half.
“Maggie played a great ball to me,” said Garcia. “I was able to get one touch on a defender and finish with my second touch. We got to go 2-1—[it] kind of put us back in the game.”
UConn raced to the lead just over eight minutes into the game as Harvard defender Carly Rotatori was dispossessed by UConn senior forward Stephanie Ribeiro, who laid the ball off to classmate Maddie Damn outside the box. The midfielder needed just one touch to take advantage of the empty space and belt a perfectly placed screamer into the top right corner.
Twenty eight minutes later, it was UConn again as a cross from the right wing found senior forward Rachel Hill, who used her first touch in the box to go around Harvard captain Bailey Gary before deftly chipping senior netminder Lizzie Durack to double the lead.
The entire Crimson offense generated several opportunities, though it failed to capitalize on most of them. Garcia narrowly overshot the crossbar in the 34th minute and nearly tied the game in the 70th minute as well.
Amidst a scramble in front of the net in which the Huskies goalie was on the ground, Damm cleared the ball just in front of the line to prevent a tied game in the 70th minute.
“The difference between the two teams today was just a little of the clinical finishing, especially in the final third,” Hamblin said. “This is really our first competition outside of our scrimmages, and we found out that we were a little rusty in that area, which is to be expected.”
Harvard dominated UConn on the corners department by a wide margin, 14 to one, and outshot their opponent 14-10. Considering the Huskies significantly outshot their opponents in their first two games, Hamblin said the fact that the Crimson were able to outmuscle UConn in that area points to the team’s strong “territorial” performance.
Garcia’s goal also marked the first time that the Huskies have been scored on this season.
Durack saved five shots, while senior forward Midge Purce tallied five shots. UConn found insurance in the 79th minute from a save that Durack wasn’t able to corral, as Hill found the back of the net off the rebound for her second goal of the game.
Asked if the game’s 3-1 result was an accurate measuring stick for the team, Hamblin noted that he was satisfied with the team’s performance, despite the loss against a top-ten team.
“We’ll go back and we’ll look at the video and see where we can be better, but overall I’m really happy with the effort and the commitment from the players,” Hamblin said. “Now we’ve just go to fine-tune and start getting some of those final details right.”
With games every three or four days until mid-September, the team will look to build upon the first match’s positive takeaways, mitigate its mistakes, and, as Garcia noted, keep on getting “comfortable as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For her entire collegiate career, Harvard senior forward Midge Purce has been known as an offensive dynamo. After finishing each of her three seasons thus far as a top-5 goalscorer in the Ivy League, and proving her ability even as defenses have keyed in on her, Purce entered her final season with few clear weaknesses in her game.
Leave it to her competitive nature, and new Crimson head coach Chris Hamblin, however, to continue to push her – on the defensive side of the ball, of all things.
On Monday night against Army, Purce put her improved all-around skills on display in one quick sequence. She made a good defensive read to intercept a pass, used her speed to blaze towards goal, and finally slotted home past Black Knights senior goalkeeper Jordan Cassalia.
“One of the things we’ve been asking her [Purce] to do more, and holding her accountable for, is her defense,” Hamblin said. “She defended and pressed well today, as did our entire defense, and that obviously led to the goal but more importantly, gave us more chances with the ball.”
Purce’s strike proved to be the difference in the game, as Harvard (1-1) walked off Jordan Field with a 1-0 victory over Army (0-4). The Crimson finishes up its season-opening homestand against Central Connecticut State on Thursday, while the Black Knights continue to search for their first win of the season.
“Army came into the game 0-3, hungry for a win, and we knew they would be fighting every minute,” Hamblin said. “We should have put away more of our chances in the first half, but we didn’t convert and they kept fighting, which made for an interesting second half.”
After Purce’s goal, which came in just the 11th minute of the game, Harvard’s defense held tight. The offense controlled the flow of the game through the end of the first half, but after the intermission, Army put more and more pressure on the Crimson goal.
The Black Knights especially showed their initiative in the first ten minutes of the second half, keeping the ball in the Harvard side of the field for long stretches at a time. They could never find the right pass in the box, however, and managed just two shots in the second 45 minutes.
The Crimson’s experienced back-line showed its composure and comfort playing as a unit, denying opposing forwards many chances.
“It was great to see how we all have each other’s backs on the field,” said Harvard captain and defender Bailey Gary. “Allie goes up for a header, Becks covers her, Becks goes up for a header, we both cover her. So it’s a tight-knit group and I’m really happy to be playing with them.”
Also crucial was the Crimson improved wing play late in the game. Senior forward Joan Fleischman provided the width with her speed on the left side. Strong performances all-around in the wide areas of the field allowed the team to control possession in the last few stages of the game and run the clock out.
With less time on the ball, Army finished the game with just four total shots, while the Crimson had an impressive 15. Many of the 15 were off target, though, as Cassalia faced only three shots on goal, saving two.
Besides Purce and the defense, sophomore midfielder Zayne Matulis also had a strong game starting in place of junior midfielder Caroline Chagares. She kept possession well and barely missed a goal when she hit the post with a header late in the first half.
Freshman forward Maggie Basta also followed up her assist in the opening game last Friday with an inspired performance off the bench. She had a game-high four shots despite playing just over 40 minutes.
Altogether, it amounted to a first win of the 2016 campaign for Harvard.
