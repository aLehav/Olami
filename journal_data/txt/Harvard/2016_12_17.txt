After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thomas C. Schelling, a Nobel laureate, “Founding Father” of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and Economics professor noted for his work on game theory and arms control, died Tuesday. He was 95.
Schelling’s career at Harvard spanned decades, and his intellectual interests ranged from nuclear war to racial segregation, and—most recently—climate change. Former students and colleagues described Schelling as a brilliant scholar driven to understand the motivations behind human behavior.
“Tom Schelling was a guiding intellectual force in the world and at the Kennedy School,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an email to Kennedy School affiliates. He described the professor as a “a giant in our own community,” “a generous colleague and incredible mentor,” and “a wonderful person.”
Richard J. Zeckhauser ’62, a Harvard Economics professor who took Schelling’s class “Games and Decisions” as an undergraduate, said he remembers a professor whose insight was pointed and direct, and with thoughts that would often amaze him.
Zeckhauser, remembering how he would react to Schelling’s work, said he would often think, “Damn, I wish I had said that. Now that he says it it’s obvious, but no one had bothered to think about it in advance.”
The impact of Schelling’s research was dramatic, according to colleagues. His 1960 book “The Strategy of Conflict” argued that the United States and the Soviet Union shared an interest in avoiding nuclear war and prompted the two Cold War powers to set up a direct phone line, Elmendorf said.
Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was inspired to make “Dr. Strangelove,” a satirical film about the Cold War, after reading one of Schelling's articles about literary representations of nuclear war. Kubrick even came to Harvard to discuss the film's plot with Schelling.
Born in 1921 in Oakland, Calif., Schelling attended University of California, Berkeley as an undergraduate before earning a Ph.D. in Economics at Harvard in 1951. He became a professor at Harvard in 1958 and spent 31 years as faculty member.
Schelling “wrote in a style that could be understood by broad audiences, despite the originality, brilliance, and rigorous underpinnings of what he was saying,” Zeckhauser wrote when Schelling was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association in 1987. “Perhaps because he stayed away from the ‘Journal of Advanced Economic Gobbledygook,’ Schelling's pathbreaking conceptual work received less attention from his home discipline than it deserved.”
But Schelling did receive academic recognition. The Nobel Prize Committee awarded him the 2005 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for “having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis.”
Because Schelling’s research interests did not fit entirely into an economics, statistics, or political science department, he and other self-described “distinguished misfits” in academia including Richard E. Neustadt, Philip B. Heymann, Howard Raiffa, C. Frederick Mosteller, and Francis M. Bator helped revitalize and reshape Kennedy School in 1969, according to Graham T. Allison ’62, a Kennedy School professor and its former dean.
“While having one foot planted squarely in their discipline, they simultaneously wanted to venture forth with the other to a new frontier: a professional School of public policy and government,” Allison wrote in an email to Kennedy School affiliates.
Students say Schelling, namesake of the “Schelling steps” that surround the Kennedy School atrium, was a committed and demanding teacher.
“You would send him a paper and you wouldn’t hear anything for two weeks,” Zeckhauser said.“He would write back a three page single-spaced document talking about your paper, which was more insightful than anything you said in your paper.”
Schelling continued writing until his death, with much of his writing about threats of climate change.
He is survived by his wife and four sons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 17, 2016 at 3:35 p.m. 
Melodie L. Jackson, who previously worked as head spokesperson at the Kennedy School of Government, has filled the role of Assistant Vice President for Communications, a position that a top University spokesperson left vacant this fall.
Jackson replaces Jeff Neal, who served as a University spokesperson for seven years before leaving Harvard in July to work on a writing project. The Assistant Vice President for Communications oversees the communications arm of the University’s centralized public relations office, Harvard Public Affairs and Communications.
HPAC handles the University’s interactions with the media and the public, efforts to lobby the federal government, and publication of the Harvard Gazette.
“Melodie is a skilled and collaborative communications leader who knows Harvard well,” Paul Andrew, the University’s Vice President for Public Affairs and Communication, wrote in a statement. “I am delighted that she will bring her knowledge and experience to lead HPAC’s talented communications team in its efforts to share the University’s priorities with our campus community and audiences beyond.”
Jackson is not new to Harvard: she has worked at the University for 11 years since becoming the Kennedy School’s head spokesperson in 2005. In that role, she managed communications surrounding the school’s controversial former Academic Dean Stephen M. Walt's decision to step down from that position, budget cuts at the Institute of Politics after the 2008 recession, and most recently, the Kennedy School’s capital campaign. She also helped lead a major rebranding effort at the school in 2007.
Before arriving at Harvard, Jackson held senior positions at Citizens Bank, Stanford University’s medical school, and the University of Maryland Medical System.

CORRECTION: December 17, 2016
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Stephen W. Walt, formerly the Academic Dean of the Kennedy School of Government, departed the school. In fact, he stepped down as academic dean and remains a professor at the school.

Dear friend,
We’re concerned about you. Since we left you in the silent section of Lamont four days ago, we haven’t seen you. You haven’t been going out, but you have been wearing less and people are starting to notice. We got a snapchat just this morning of you stripping down in the bathroom to clean yourself—you're starting to scare off the freshmen! To be honest, we’re not entirely sure why you're still in Lamont. Your Orgo exam is over (did you even go!?), and from what you told us a few weeks ago your last final has already passed.
What have you been doing? You stopped live-tweeting your “death march” (these are your words, not ours) through finals week at least 36 hours ago and you haven’t charged your Crimson cash account with vending machine fees in ages. We checked.
Really, we’re writing this letter because we care about you... but also because we're starting to get complaints from fellow classmates. Apparently the entire building is starting to smell faintly like Adams did last spring, and people are saying the stench is emanating from you.
Please come home to us. But take a shower first!
With love (and mild disgust),
Your blockmates
