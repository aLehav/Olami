PRAGUE, Czech Republic—In the Sedlec Ossuary, about an hour outside of Prague, crowds of tourists turn their cameras on stacks of human skulls and chandeliers suspended by chains of jawbones. The 40,000 odd people whose remains adorn the walls and ceilings of the small chapel receive over 200,000 visitors every year. On this hot afternoon in late June there are probably around 550 of us, maybe more since its the height of the tourist season. Surrounded by so many smiling tourists posing for photographs, their children running around and hesitantly sticking out their hands to touch a skull here and there, in the center of this throng of the living, it’s hard to really feel the presence of the dead. Though their bones dangle from the rafters and indifferentiable eye sockets stare out at you by the hundreds, an equally indifferentiable mass, with their ever present cameras, has reduced these victims of plagues, wars and time to nothing more than the content of images, trophies of tourism. One ought, perhaps, to stop to examine each row of hanging humeruses, each flower of pelvises, as Frantisek Rint, the man hired in 1870 to arrange the excess bones from the small graveyard that surrounds the chapel, must have, searching in each for macabre decorative potential. But the tide of tourists is too strong. We’re soon back out on the tour bus lined sidewalk, heading towards the nearby town of Kutna Hora to eat lunch.
As we get to the center of town each restaurant we come to is closed, defying the hours printed confidently on their doors without explanation. The streets, too, are largely deserted. I hear something that sounds as if someone far away is speaking into a loudspeaker. Soon we round a corner and come upon a dense crowd of people. The street is blocked off and the sidewalks lined with temporary barriers. What must be a large percentage of the local population presses against them. The elderly and the young alike focus with rapt attention on what is going on in the middle of the street. It is a kind of competition I’ve never seen before. Huge hulking men attempt, one after another, to lift and overturn gigantic tires. A good many of the spectators have their phones and cameras out, documenting the efforts of each competitor as he progresses down the line. As they struggle under the weight, their faces red with sweat glistening on their bald heads. Young children and teenagers climb on the temporary fence cheer and shout. And when one competitor fails and gives on the third tire, their shouting takes on an air of reproach. We spot an open kebab restaurant and disengage from yet another crowd of onlookers fascinated by the somewhat perverse potential of the human body.

RWANDA—19 years ago this month, Rwanda was a place that seemed to be full of evil; it is hard to imagine a society in a worse state. And yet, living here, I frequently find myself marveling at how good its people are: they are all warm and welcoming, and their commitment to kindness and generosity borders on illogical. How this can be is a question I have grappled with, as I am sure have many Rwandans.
The best answer I can find is that we should not generalize. Humans are incredible organisms, with the capacity to do things both great and terrible, things that are often not consistent with each other. It could be argued that to characterize a single person, let alone a nation, with one adjective serves only to flatten a multifaceted entity into a preconceived mold.
I bring this up partly because of a word in Kinyarwanda (Rwanda’s national language), urunturuntu, which translates as “humanity”; but it requires some more explanation. It is related to umuntu “person,” and encompasses everything that is perceived as separating humans from the rest of the natural world. When we talk about “humanity” in English, we think of valued qualities like courage, compassion, and generosity, even though looking out the window provides abundant evidence that there is more to humanity than that. This Kinyarwanda word acknowledges all the rest as well. It calls to mind an image of human society as a diverse, messy mixture of people and actions, full of good and bad and everything in between: something that can only be described in English as “human.”
There is a proverb that incorporates that word: Aho abantu bari ntihabura urunturuntu. Roughly translated, “Places where people have been will not lack humanity.” In other words, for better and for worse, human beings leave their mark wherever they go. I have just been railing against broad generalizations, but I think this one is insightful: it is an old saying, but it finds a way to reconcile two sides of a problem that is very relevant today.
Who has been here and not wondered how this could be the same Rwanda, full of the same Rwandans, that shocked the world in 1994? This is the only answer that makes sense to me, though it may not be a totally comfortable one: Rwanda does not lack humanity, nor has it in recent history. It so happens that it has shown both the worst and the best that humanity has to offer, but the spirit that underlies both might be the only thing that has been constant through it all.

FORT LEE, New Jersey—Reading Crimson postcards (and trying to figure out what’s going on in the background of Snapchats from friends who’ve gone abroad), I can’t help but wonder—am I wasting time? Should I have done something more with my summer?
I like my metals trading internship, during which I’ve learned about things like anti-dumping regulations, Incoterms, and zirconium oxychloride.  I’m not sure that I want to manage shipments of potassium fluoroborate for the rest of my life. And I’m not sure that God didn’t forget “thou shalt not heat up fish in the office microwave” when He handed down the Ten Commandments. Yet I enjoy the work.
The commute between my Queens, New York, home and the Fort Lee, New Jersey, office is a little less than two hours each way. It’d be faster if I just drove (which I can do legally, just not safely) or if, instead of waiting for a NJ Transit bus across the George Washington Bridge, I were to hitchhike. But I can’t imagine getting into the backseat of one of the cars lined up near the bus stop without also imagining winding up in the trunk.
Long as it first seemed, I’ve grown to like the commute (except for the Times Square/Port Authority stop—this cesspool I will always hate), even if the exhausted high-school-er in me who rode the crowded subway every day would consider this a major betrayal. I keep my music—the opiate of those who take mass transit—on shuffle, partially because I don’t want to have to interrupt my internal monologue and partially because, in music and in life, I don’t really know what I want, I’m just sort of hoping that it’ll happen of its own accord and that I’ll recognize it when it does.
Shuffle is dangerous business when your iTunes library includes songs like the techno remix of the “Inspector Gadget” theme, so I keep the volume low. In any case, the iPhone merely makes the commute tolerable; music and Fruit Ninja only go so far in the way of escape and intrigue. Books are the company that makes the trip good. Some of my favorite people are books.
I’ve explored the part of Fort Lee that I can cover during my lunch hour. Weeks pass without my really noticing; I do the same thing every day. To be honest, I anticipated tedium—for this summer to feel bland, unexciting.
I just never expected not to mind. This is not the generalized longing and anxiety I’d assumed was in my contract.
I remind myself that I’m not dead yet—one day I’ll see the world, or maybe Hoboken. But as time dissolves behind me, it feels odd that I’m not sorry to see it go.

UPDATED: July 15, 2013, at 8:46 p.m.
Health-conscious fast-food chain Clover indefinitely closed its operations, including its restaurant in Harvard Square, this weekend after learning that some people with confirmed cases of salmonella had eaten at Clover in the days prior to their illness.
“We don’t want even the chance [of] creating illness, so we thought it best to close our operations until we know more,” Clover founder and CEO Ayr Muir wrote in a blog post on the company’s website.
Twelve recent cases of Salmonella have been confirmed in the state, according to Anne Roach, media relations manager for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Roach wrote in an emailed statement that the MDPH “is working cooperatively with the City of Cambridge and other municipalities to investigate and identify” the source of the outbreak. Muir wrote on the website that the last known case was from June 27.
After learning late Friday night of the outbreak’s possible connection to Clover, Muir wrote on Saturday that his management team is now “scouring every surface of every operation” and that the company is examining its suppliers and ingredients. He added that “all appropriate" employees are being tested for salmonella.
“Right now I really don’t know much,” Muir wrote. “I’ve asked the state to share any details with us as their investigation proceeds. We’ll keep you updated. We’re going to be extra careful and we’re not opening any location until we learn more.”
Muir could not be reached for comment.
