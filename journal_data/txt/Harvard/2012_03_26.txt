Oleanna
March 29-31, 8:00 p.m.,
March 31, April 1 2:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m.
Winthrop House Library
Directed by Rachel V. Byrd ’13
Produced by Aly G. Martinez ’13
If you visit the Winthrop House Library one evening this weekend, don’t expect to get much studying done. Instead, prepare for what promises to be a night of captivating drama as the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Society presents David Mamet’s “Oleanna.”
The 1992 play, originally staged here in Cambridge in conjunction with the American Repertory Theater, follows the interactions of John (Ronald N. Lacey), who teaches at a prestigious university, and Carol (Anna A. Hagen ’15), one of his students. Carol comes to her professor one day seeking to talk about the difficulties she has been experiencing in his class. However, tensions flare in their ensuing conversations, turning what may have been a constructive exchange of knowledge into a high-stakes intellectual war. In order to authentically portray the age differential between the teacher and the student in this production, director Rachel V. Byrd ’13 opted to cast Ronald Lacey—who  works at the Cabot Library and who himself has taught college classes in South Carolina—as John.
“We did the usual Common Casting, but I also put a posting on Stagesource.org for an older professor, and that’s how we got in touch with Ron,” says Byrd.
The entire play takes place inside of John’s office, and the only characters seen or heard throughout the play are John and Carol, which can make it a demanding play to perform as the entirety of show’s impact is down to the two acters and their on-stage chemistry. Also contributing to the challenge is Mamet’s characteristically idiosyncratic dialogue. Rather than perfectly articulating all of their thoughts, the characters repeat themselves, interrupt one another, and trail off in mid-sentence. The team of “Oleanna” appreciates the artistry of the characters’ unique manner of speech.
“Mamet tries to imprint the language of everyday conversation, which is not a finished language or a polished language, and find the poetry in it,” says Hagen. The nature of the unconventional performance space prevents the staff from relying heavily on technical elements or effects during the production, and the cast intends to use to its advantage. “What’s nice [about] staging a play this way is that it really lets the audience focus on the actors and the text and the communication,” Lacey commented.
According to Byrd, Mamet’s play deals with themes that merit some examination beyond the pages of the script. “That’s one of the reasons we’re having talkbacks after the show,” she says. Byrd hopes that audience members will join the cast and staff to discuss the issues raised by the struggle between John and Carol. “It’s meant to leave audiences in dialogue. It doesn’t tell you who is right or who is wrong.”

A female scientist, a poetic script, gizmos, and an intellectual romance—“Futurity” has everything a hipster intellectual could ask for. Directed by Sarah Benson and running until April 15 at OBERON, “Futurity” features music from the band The Lisps and a script written by its frontman César Alvarez. The show  revolves around the cast’s magnetic stage presence which, when combined with an innovative set design, makes this show a quirky musical triumph.
Set during the American Civil War, “Futurity” is a clever sci-fi musical that incorporates folksy songs by the aforementioned band into the plotline. The protagonist Julian Munro (César Alvarez) is an optimistic inventor and soldier who hopes to construct a machine that brings about peace. “There’s a war that I’ll solve with the twist of a knob,” he sings when he begins to dream up the idea for his machine.
Opposite him is Ada Lovelace (Sammy Tunis), the soulful and sexy scientist. Clad  in red lipstick, purple high-heeled shoes, and a dress made out of gauze, Tunis manages to make science alluring by crooning about mathematical equations while writing on her chalkboard. The romance that ensues between Munro and her is grounded in intellect—they first meet when she agrees to help him build his machine. As the work progresses their courtship blossoms despite their long distance relationship—facilitated by letters, carried diagonally by clothesline from the lower stage to the upper banisters—and the disapproval of Ada’s Mother, Lady Byron (Anne Gottlieb.)
The most innovative part of the production is the set. Designer David Israel Raynoso built the set primarily out of found objects piled atop industrial equipment. This contraption not only hides the musical instruments from the audience, but also acts as an instrument of percussion in itself, as musicians bang on its sides during the musical numbers. The audience sits at tables scattered in the middle of the venue, while the action takes place on all sides. This back-and-forth style of following the dialogue and musical discourse allows the audience to engage with the cast members, letting them see every wrinkle and bead of sweat in the actor’s facial expressions.
The chorus members, in their navy blue, suspendered attire, manage to capture a sense of individuality while still working as a cohesive whole, especially in accordance with the intimate setup. Alvarez’s direction of the chorus is spotless, with beautiful harmonies that transition from a whisper to a shout. They also play their outragious characterizations to hilarious effect. One scene in particular has the chorus acting as a community of scientists that that might provide Munro with crucial fundng for his project. With bedsheets wrapped ornately around their heads and pompous foreign accents, they saunter around the balcony, loudly clearing their throats in a parody of close-minded intellectuals.
The music is refreshingly diverse. Using anything from a tuba to a tin can to produce sound, the musicians’ clanging and shouting juxtaposes nicely with the complex lyrics of scientific inquiries. Instead of complicated choreography, the actors movements are beautifully simple and subtle, for in such a small space a conflicted glance from Tunis or the swig from a metal flask can speak volumes.
One of the notable performances is from the General (Edwin Lee Gibson.) With a voice not too dissimilar from Samuel Jackson’s, he provided a brilliant counterpoint to Alvarez. His practicality, contrasted with Munro’s idealism, causes Munro to question his farfetched ideas.  With lines like, “God made [the urge to fight] instinct, war makes it art,” his words embody the respect a fearless leader can command.“Impossible is just a medium through which an idea travels on its way to the possible,” says Munro, and the theme of the show is as idealistic as the convictions of its main character. “Futurity” is grounded in a sentiment of hope, and this factor makes it so engaging. Philosophical implications and academic references abound, from Socrates to Lord Byron, although knowing the meaning of these references is ultimately unimportant to an understanding of the show. The point—embodied in the machine that aims to solve the world’s problems through an industrial process—was that intellect, and physical and intellectual labor, must work together to bring about Munro’s much sought-after untopia. This sense of synthesis between mental and physical action communicates the idea that our imaginations, whether regarding war, peace, science or love, can, as the General says, “excitedly lead us over a cliff.”
Overall, “Futurity” is a poignant tale of what it means to believe in something, logical or not. It is not just a musical for philosophers in love; its combination of fantastic music and innovative set design make it a brilliantly executed piece that stands as one of the A.R.T.’s strongest recent showings.

“This world would be empty without the blues,” says legendary singer Ma Rainey (Yvette Freeman) as she discusses with her band the importance of the music they play, as well as life for African-Americans as they try to make their mark in a country dominated by whites. For her, the blues is the reality of blatant inequality in America as well as the incredible music that makes her life, no matter how hard, worth living.
It is this interplay that characterizes the Huntington Theatre’s production of August Wilson’s masterpiece “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” directed by Liesl Tommy and running at the Boston University Theatre through April 8. The play combines fantastic acting that probes the relationships between the deeply flawed main chracters with live music played onstage by the cast members. Through this synthesis “Ma Rainey” explores the tensions of age and race that defined America in the 1920s and the music that transcended it.
“Ma Rainey” forms one part of August Wilson’s “Pittsburgh Cycle,” a set of 10 plays—each one set in a different decade—that explores the African-American experience during the 20th century. The story revolves around the famous blues diva Ma Rainey­—who is respected and feared in equal measure because of her demanding temperment—and her back-up band: band leader and trombone player Cutler (G. Valmont Thomas) and bassist Slow Drag (Glenn Turner), the band’s veteran players, reminisce about old times on the road, while the old pianist Toledo (Charles Weldon) tries to impart some of his wisdom on the young, talented, and  hot-headed trumpeter Levee (Jason Bowen). While the band members wait for Ma Rainey to arrive at a recording studio. In one scene their conversations become tense as Cultler and Levee argue over the direction of the band. After Ma arrives with her entourage, the band’s squabbles become framed by the conversations between the black musicians and the white businessmen who run the recording studio, and these dialogues highlight the racial exploitation at the heart of race relations in America.
The cast is incredible all around, but Bowen stands out from the rest. He plays up Levee’s faux easygoing nature in a way that brilliantly hints at the character’s fundamental insecurity, and this nuance makes the revelations about his past all the more shocking. For example, after Levee is teased by the rest of the band because his tough talk does not match up to how he bows and scrapes around the white recording studio executive Sturdyvant (Thomas Derrah), Bowen explodes. With a mix of fury and grief describes how he was forced to watch the rape of his mother by a gang of white men when he was a young child, and how he almost died when he tried to stop it. His voice becomes choked with a mixture of hopeless grief and unbound rage as he   rips off his shirt to reveal the scar his attackers left on his chest.
Racism is not only characterized by acts of horrific violence, and “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” also explores with equal sensitivity the prejudice that enforced African-American’s status as second-class citizens. In one of the play’s more riviting scenes, Ma Rainey briefly drops her diva mask and explains that she has to be so demanding to the people she works with because it is the only way of getting the respect she deserves. She goes on to explain that although she has been working with her white manager Irvin (Will LeBow) for six years, the only time he ever invited her to his house was to sing for some of his white friends. Freeman relaxes her facial muscles and releases her tight sholders, physically showing the relief of a woman who after years of tension can finally for a moment let her guard down and show her true self.
Such scenes illuminate the motivations of all of the African-American characters. Everything from Levee’s hot-headedness to Cutler’s rigid obedience to Ma’s vision for the band can be read as a way of trying to recapture a sense of dignity that has been denied them because of the color of their skin. If Levee deals with the whites with a rambunctious individualism, Cutler attempts to convey a stern work ethic by double checking the setlist with Irvin and trying to force the band to play Ma’s arrangements of her songs. However, this does not stop him from smoking marijuana in the practice room with the rest of the musicians.
“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” is a seminal work by one of America’s most influential modern playwrights. It is a gripping narrative of the pain of racial inequality and the joys that music can bring, and the broken characters that society left by the wayside. By casting  a bleak shadow over the so-called Roaring Twenties, “Ma Rainey” explores the men and women whose suffering and talent helped to create modern American music.

In an excellent piece that recently appeared on the opinion page of the Harvard Crimson, Crimson editorial executive Michael F. Cotter ’14 discussed America’s invisible epidemic of sexual violence as “an issue of failed law enforcement.” In order to diminish the incidence of sexual assault, he writes, “we must root out those who commit sexual assaults and prosecute them.” But one glaring question remained unaddressed in Cotter’s otherwise spot-on piece: What is it that makes our culture so unwilling to prosecute sex crimes? The answer is not lack of will, as such: Rape has passionate opponents and few defenders. However, social narratives surrounding sex create spaces and situations where predators can operate without fear of punishment.
Writer and activist Jaclyn Friedman has developed a sociological theory that outlines the deeply entrenched social framework that silences victims of sexual violence and shields their assailants. Sexual violence and the culture that overlooks it fits squarely within what Friedman refers to as the woman-as-gatekeeper model of heterosexual sex. The male initiator/female gatekeeper model is the bread and butter of our culture’s discourse on sex and sexuality. We are exposed to it everywhere: in films and TV shows, in popular music, and in conversations with our peers and even well meaning sex educators. In the gatekeeper model, men assume the role of initiators of sexual activity and women of “gatekeepers” who reluctantly grant their partners access to their sexuality.
Consider, for example, how commonplace are depictions of sexual encounters in popular culture in which women—particularly young women—express reluctance to engage in sexual activity, either through their body language or verbalized “no”s, before finally “giving in.” In one of the most telling examples of our culture’s hostile attitude toward female sexuality, the Motion Picture Association of America refused to give the 2011 film “Sucker Punch” a rating lower than R until female sexual pleasure was removed from a sexually explicit scene. After editing the segment so drastically that it appeared that the woman was being taken advantage of, the filmmakers decided to delete the scene altogether. The gatekeeper model is such an ingrained component of our cultural vocabulary that female sexual agency, when it is not invisible, is deemed obscene.
The problems with the gatekeeper model are many, but its most harrowing consequence is that it makes our culture unwilling to try incidences of sexual assault that do not look like “dark alley” scenarios in which women are raped by strangers. It has been well documented that the overwhelming majority of sexual assaults are committed not by strangers in dark alleys, but in private spaces by assailants who know their victims. Yet in a culture where the dominant sexual narrative is one in which men are aggressors to whom women halfheartedly cede sex, sexual assaults committed by acquaintances or partners all too often go unprosecuted because they are evocative of the model that pervades our cultural vocabulary. Female victims are often told that they were “asking for it”—by wearing provocative clothing, flirting, or consenting to sexual activity with a partner and later electing to stop—because the gatekeeper model constructs men as sexual aggressors who are neither able nor expected to restrain their sexual urges and women as provocateurs who need to do little more than flirt to give their tacit consent.
This is certainly not to say that a plurality of men are “accidentally” committing sexual assault. Friedman’s work shows just the opposite—sexual assaults are committed by a small percentage of men, the vast majority of whom are repeat offenders. These sociopaths, said Friedman, “know exactly what they’re doing.” Indeed, rapists exploit the gatekeeper model. As predators, they look for the opportunity to strike without penalty, and when we create a sexual narrative that focuses on permission instead of affirmative consent, we create that space. Sexual assaults are too often considered a failure of the victim for having put herself in a situation in which sex was “expected” of her rather than a crime of the assailant.
The gatekeeper model is also harmful to male victims of sexual assault. Typically cast as aggressors of sexual activity, male victims, too, face hostility and skepticism. The myth that males can’t be victims of sexual violence, rooted in our cultural perception of men as sexually aggressive initiators rather than reluctant receivers, deters men from reporting sex crimes and prevents us from prosecuting the rape of men. Shockingly, until October 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s definition of rape—“the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will”—failed to acknowledge even the possibility of male rape. (In fact, an estimated 10 percent of rape victims are male.)
The gatekeeper model is ultimately not necessary. We can and should develop and live out more consent-positive models of sex (conveniently, this week’s inaugural Sex Week at Harvard is an excellent place to start). And every time we think about sex as something both partners want, enjoy, and actively seek out and share, we’re not just helping fight abusers and predators. We’re making our sex lives better, as well.

The Gender-Neutral Games
This Friday marked the theatrical release of “The Hunger Games,” the film adaptation of Suzanne Collins’ popular young adult novel.The franchise’s move to the silver screen places it among the legions of vampires, wizards, and singing and dancing teens that often leave middle school girls swooning and feminist critics groaning. The Hunger Games, however, is different: The female protagonist is a highly skilled hunter, while the primary male character’s greatest talent is frosting cakes. As a result, the series has earned acclaim for its tone of female empowerment. However, in praising the lead female’s characteristically masculine traits, critics undermine The Hunger Games’ decidedly gender-neutral political agenda.
Teenage readers and middle-aged reviewers alike agree that Katniss, the protagonist of the franchise, is “a strong feminist role model: independent, skilled, fierce.” Katniss may be a strong woman, but The Hunger Games ultimately cautions against the very strengths that its main character upholds and critics exhort. With independence comes the temptation of apathy: At a strategic high and moral low during the Games, Katniss recognizes the ease with which she could survive if she left weaker, injured allies behind. Her sharp intellect and hunting skills brand her as a poster-child of survival of the fittest, the harsh world order against which the books elaborately protest. Her fierceness faintly echoes the ruthlessness of her oppressors; indeed, the overwhelming nature of vengeance is explored in-depth in the final book of the trilogy. Independence, skill, and relentlessness are the “strong, feminist” qualities that readers celebrate, but they are also the qualities that Collins’ books implicitly censure.
For what ideal, then, does The Hunger Games advocate? Femininity, it would seem. After all, Katniss ultimately chooses companionship over independence, relinquishes the dangerous power that her skills facilitate in favor of temperance, and trades her wrath for an attempt at tranquility, even domesticity. Through the eyes of Katniss, the cruel and destructive world of Panem has only two true heroes: Peeta, a non-aggressive, sensitive and deeply caring boy; and Primrose, an even more gentle, caring, angelic little girl. These characters do not exhibit the physical strength, political aggression, or obstinacy that characterize most of the prominent figures in the series. Indeed, they serve as the moral center of Katniss’s universe precisely because of their impermeability to the aggression around them, what Collins symbolically alludes to as “fire.” In The Hunger Games, fire is attractive and powerful, but it destroys everything in its path. On the contrary, redemption is possible through love, nurturing, and non-violence—qualities that carry feminine connotations.
The Hunger Games could easily be interpreted as a feminist allegory. In a sadistic, masculine world, Katniss is “a fiery teenage huntress battling to overcome a corrupt, male-dominated system.” Yet the franchise’s political undertone is more complicated, still. It crusades against brutality, but simultaneously condones it. With adrenaline-pumping passages, now translated into Hollywood action sequences, Collins invites us to revel in the gory glory of the Games. Real-life readers and viewers mirror the audience within the story, rooting for the survival of their favorite characters—and thereby, the deaths of other characters. At the same time, the story inspires us with the lofty feminized ideal of prioritizing altruistic selflessness over self-preservation, as demonstrated by an official trailer for the movie that heavily emphasizes the heroic self-sacrifice Katniss commits by taking her younger sister’s place in the Hunger Games. Somehow, the series refuses to fully embrace aggression or non-violence, and even hints at the futility of searching for a happy medium. With no resolution in sight, The Hunger Games leaves its fans confronting what we knew all along: Neither gender is superior. There is no paradigm for a perfect human, because no such being exists.
It is worth noting that the attributes of passivity and agression are not gendered in Collins’ literary universe. Remarkably, The Hunger Games assumes that gender is not circumscribed by defining character traits. Just as Katniss’ femininity is not questioned because of her emotional toughness, Peeta’s manhood is not doubted because of his emotional vulnerability. The nation of Panem may be an archaic dictatorship, but its post-gender social organization far outpaces the social advancement of our modern society. It takes for granted a principle that would startle much of The Hunger Games’ readership: there is nothing inherently masculine about aggression or feminine about passivity.
The Hunger Games largely avoids the restrictive lens of gender. Within Collins’ literary world, Katniss is characterized neither as feminine nor as feminist; she is merely a complex, humanized character. Perhaps this is the real victory of the Games.

Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson recently announced that she will step down from her office and accept a position as vice president and dean of Colgate College. Nelson was the first to occupy the position of Dean of Student Life, a position that was created in 2009. While we are glad that the position exists insofar as it has the capacity to invigorate student life and demonstrates a commitment on the part of the College to improve its performance in this area, it has, unfortunately, pursued this goal in all the wrong ways. Regrettably, the Office of Student Life is often all too eager to penalize student groups that are within its reach rather than those unaffiliated with the University that present a real threat to student wellbeing. In doing so, the OSL harms those groups that are not a big part of the problem and make social life at Harvard even more dependent on those outside organizations. This runs counter to the office’s ideal role as a proponent of student life. In this spirit, we hope that Nelson’s successor will serve as more of an advocate for student life and make the OSL a more accessible and cooperative resource for students.
While it often seems that there are too many deans and officers overseeing their own little fiefdoms at Harvard, the Dean of Student Life is one whose existence is truly necessary and welcome recent creation. For the vast majority of students, extracurricular activities are an enormously significant component of life at Harvard, and for many, extracurricular commitments are even more rewarding than academics. The Dean of Student Life and the OSL are thus uniquely poised to enrich one of the most important aspects of a Harvard education.
Unfortunately, the OSL has in many ways squandered that opportunity. The office has taken to targeting student organizations in an attempt to make a clearly visible effort to stem dangerous drinking.  However, like so many other programs designed to look good but not confront the real problem, these initiatives do nothing to target final clubs or groups like them that really lie at the center of Harvard’s alcohol woes where and when they occur.  Indeed, by attacking these largely benign college-recognized organizations, and turning them into scapegoats for concerned parents and alumni, the OSL makes it only more likely that the social scene at Harvard will slip farther out of their purview into less regulated and less safe spaces.
The treatment of student organizations is in large part problematic because the OSL has placed a disproportionate emphasis on alcohol in regards to their duties. While alcohol use is understandably a concern for all, the OSL’s exceedingly narrow focus on this issue prevents them from addressing many other concerns that they really ought to be working on.
With this in mind, we hope that the new Dean of Student Life will be one that has had experience working as advocates for student groups
The new dean should also make the OSL more transparent and accessible to students. Currently, the OSL and its services are notoriously difficult to deal with. It is a common complaint of students that the OSL responds slowly or that administrators are difficult and unfriendly. Indeed, the OSL is notoriously bureaucratic, which has made it difficult for students to communicate with the office effectively. This must be improved.
Also difficult to interact with are many of the OSL’s most basic services for student organizations. Its room reservation portal, for example, is cumbersome and difficult to understand. The Student Organization Center at Hilles, already inconvenient for most students because of its location in the Quad, is made even more so by the restrictions imposed on students to using it. The SOCH Cinema, for example, cannot be reserved by organizations without obtaining licenses for films that they would like to screen, a process that is unreasonably expensive for students to take on.
The OSL’s focus on policing rather than supporting student organizations has been detrimental to student life at Harvard. While we understand that it is OSL’s responsibility to step in when student welfare is demonstrably at risk, we urge the office to understand itself, first and foremost, as the proponent of student life that it should be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I finished up a rowdy spring break (or, as some call it, SpRiNg BrEaK) with friends last weekend, I couldn’t help but think: This is the ultimate college life. Spending time with the people I enjoy; cheering on my peers in the NCAA basketball tournament; watching a recent alumnus, Jeremy Lin ’10, soar to celebrity heights, just as puns also make a comeback (the vio-Lin section of my orchestra had a field day); eating, drinking, and being merry. During this week off, I realized that I go to Harvard, the greatest party school in the history of the world.
Or so I thought. I checked outside sources to confirm that Harvard has the best social scene in higher education, confidently searching on Google for the Princeton Review’s rankings of the best party schools. To my dismay, the annual survey, which has ratings whose inconsistencies are exceeded by only Flyby Blog’s house rankings, placed Harvard…nowhere on the list. The top slot last year went to Ohio University, which is known for the Athens Halloween Street Party, an annual “event” (if you can call it that) that draws over 20,000 people every fall. How lame is that?
Apparently, outsiders think that Harvard is socially deficient. I eagerly clicked on one article with the headline “Princeton Review: Harvard Is #1 Party School.” Sadly, it turned out to be a joke, facetiously claiming that some of our top gatherings included a Ballroom Dance-o-rama (at least the after-party was fun!), a Shakespeare Sonnet Night with Elena Kagan ’86 (it was a going-away party), or a Timed Rubik’s Cube Competition (okay, that was one time).
On the other hand, the radio show This American Life mentioned Harvard in its episode about the #1 party school in the country, according to the Princeton Review. To clarify, the broadcast featured Penn State, which topped the list in 2009. But Harvard did get a shout-out; the show’s host, Ira Glass, mentioned the Harvard School of Public Health’s study about “what schools tend to have the heaviest drinking.” Go Crimson!
Despite our poor reputation, I don’t see any failings in the Harvard social scene. Sure, we don’t have a student center, but who needs one when you already have fantastic outlets for mingling, like Lamont Café on Burrito Night or ISawYouHarvard on any night? I had never heard the phrase “social space” prior to coming to Harvard, though I quickly learned how to incorporate it into my daily lexicon (hint: use it instead of “big room”). Harvard lacks social spaces, so goes the argument, but perhaps those who complain simply don’t see how great we have it. Rather than put typical spaces (like rooms) into cliché places (like buildings), the Harvard Common Spaces program instead inaugurated a temporary ice skating rink this winter and plunks a few colorful seats in Harvard Yard every spring. Now, I don’t know of any other school with social spaces more exciting than a cold, un-walkable ground or a bunch of metal chairs. And how could we forget Yardfest, the pinnacle of social activity that takes place every spring? Only Harvard provides enough funding for a band that was featured in last year’s one-hit-wonder’s one hit. Das awesome.
Perhaps it is in Harvard administrators’ best interest not to let our party-hardy reputation creep beyond the Yard. But as someone who has experienced almost zero shortcomings in Harvard social life over the course of my four years here, I feel obliged to improve outside perception of Harvard. To that end, I declare: Harvard has the best social scene in the whole universe. We are the #1 Party School.
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going for a quick skate around the Science Center—that is, as long as the ice hasn’t melted yet.

A team of three undergraduates clinched the first place title at the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the 28th time a Harvard team has won, the Mathematical Association of America announced last week.
The first place prize consisted of $25,000, and the team members­—Eric K. Larson ’13, Evan M. O’Dorney ’15, and Lin “Alex” Zhai ’12—also each received $1,000. O’Dorney individually placed in the top five, earning him the title of Putnam Fellow and an additional award of $2,500.
“Money doesn’t really make a difference, though,” O’Dorney said. “The things I like can’t be bought with money, like spending time with my family.”
Zhai finished amongst the top 25, and Larson received honorable mention. Allen Yuan ’15 also received an honorable mention.
Administered by the MAA, the Putnam Competition is held annually for the top undergraduate mathematics students in the United States and Canada.
Around 60 Harvard students took the test in December, and the Harvard team is comprised of the three students who scored highest in the previous year’s competition, according to mathematics professor Peter Kronheimer, who proctored the exam this year.
O’Dorney took last year’s Putnam test while still a senior in high school, placing in the top 24. He was invited to compete with the Putnam team from the University of California, Berkeley, after his score topped other students’.
“I don’t know where my math talent comes from—it’s just a gift from God,” said O’Dorney, who is also the 2011 Intel Science Talent Search Competition first place winner and the 2007 Scripps National Spelling Bee champion.
For this past year’s Putnam competition, O’Dorney said he “had very little time to prepare due to schoolwork.”
“I briefly solved three problems from an old Putnam, and the Putnam day itself was very hectic due to a Glee Club concert that I performed in that night,” O’Dorney said.
O’Dorney said he ran back and forth between the Science Center and Sanders Theater all day in order to attend both Putnam testing sessions and Glee Club rehearsals.
With the exception of 2004, at least one of the five Putnam Fellows has been a Harvard student in every year’s competition since 1990. Harvard has placed first more than any other school in the history of the competition, 18 wins ahead of next-place California Institute of Technology.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s first-ever Sex Week, which aims to promote thoughtful discourse on issues of sex and sexuality through education, conversation, and vagina-themed cupcakes, kicked off Sunday with a presentation by Megan Andelloux, a certified sexuality educator and sexologist.
The weeklong event, organized by the Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College, features speakers, seminars, and movies that explore topics such as love, sex, sexuality, gender, gender identity, and relationships.
Harvard’s inaugural Sex Week comes just months after Yale’s biennial Sex Week faced an uncertain future. Though the Yale administration did not ban the popular event as some students feared, the administration did ban corporate sponsorship.
SHEATH was co-founded earlier this year by Samantha A. Meier ’12 and Abby P. Sun ’13. Both Meier and Sun served as leaders in the Peer Contraceptive Counselors program, and Sun has organized the popular Female Orgasm Seminar for the last two years.
The duo said that though there are many events on campus dealing with sex and love, the programming was often targeted at one demographic.
“The QSA might host an event on sexuality, but it would only get publicized over the QSA list,” said Meier. “Sex Week provides a platform for groups already doing amazing work to consolidate resources and bring communities together.”
Meier said she sees the week as a unifying event for students.
“Sex Week connects people while demonstrating and continually reflecting that people are different,” she said. “Sex Week builds community in this very strong way in which you are engaging with something that is personal in an intellectual, deep, and rigorous way.”
Co-sponsors of the week’s events include the Harvard College Women’s Center, the Center for Wellness, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
“OSAPR is happy to be participating in Sex Week at Harvard College,” said Sarah Rankin, the Director of OSAPR, in a SHEATH press release. “We believe that talking about issues like honest communication, enthusiastic consent, and the opportunity for self-reflection fosters an environment that supports healthy sexual experiences.”
Given the many events to choose from during Sex Week, Meier and Sun said they hope students will take the opportunity to explore and keep an open mind.
“I think Sex Week is going to be an individual experience for students,” said Meier. “I think having an intellectual curiosity and not being afraid of going to something you might not think is relevant to your own life is what I would stress.”
Sex week events include a panel on discussing sex with your physician, held Monday at 6:30 p.m. in the Adams Lower Common Room. Tuesday will feature a lecture on criminal law and affirmative consent in Griswold 110 at 6 p.m. and a discussion on how to talk about sex in Science Center C at 8 p.m. on Tuesday.
Throughout the week, a SHEATH table on the Science Center lawn will feature free safer sex supplies, educational materials, and activities. Representatives from partner organizations including peer-counseling groups will be on site to answer questions.
Students who “like” Sex Week on Facebook or follow Sex Week on Twitter are automatically entered into a daily drawing for prizes which include sex toys, t-shirts, books, lotions, and sunglasses.
“We don’t see this as just a onetime thing,” said Meier. “We see this as a start of a greater discussion.”

Members of the Black Men’s Forum honored actress Jada Pinkett Smith as well as their Harvard peers at the group’s 18th annual Celebration of Black Women on Saturday.
The event honored black female students and celebrated the accomplishments of black women in the wider world.
Pinkett Smith—an actress, producer, director, author, singer-songwriter, and businesswoman—was recognized for her trailblazing professional success. She is known for her roles in films such as “Jason’s Lyric,” “The Matrix Reloaded,” and “The Nutty Professor.”
“She embodies all that Woman of the Year Award stands for,” wrote Black Men’s Forum President Damilare Sonoiki ’13, an inactive Crimson news editor, in the program for the event.
The event also honored members of Harvard’s black community. Seniors Alexandra L. L. Almore ’12, Ijeoma B. Ebo ’12, Naseemah Y. Mohamed ’12, Olamide E. Oladipo ’12 and Erica K. Senat ’12 received senior leadership awards.
Kimberly D. Ellis ’15, Yolanda K. Borquaye ’14 and Rachel V. Byrd ’13 were awarded freshman, sophomore and junior leadership prizes.
Guests in black-tie attire enjoyed a three-course meal in Leverett House to the tune of a jazz quartet before the awards presentation.
S. Allen Counter, director of the Harvard Foundation, commended Pinkett Smith and her husband, actor Will Smith, for their humanitarian work in his introductory speech.
Rather than presenting a rehearsed speech to accept the award, Pinkett Smith requested that students ask her questions. In her responses, she touched on her professional and personal role models, her values as a mother, her decision to become an actor, and her advice to young women seeking to balance a successful career with a fulfilling family life.
Pinkett Smith said that she aims to communicate to other black women that anything is possible. She said that it was unexpected for a black woman to sing in a metal band, but that did not stop her.
“I’ve strived to show that we can be and do anything that we want,” she said.
She also emphasized the importance of the black community celebrating women’s achievements not just once a year, but every day.
“She did a great job,” said event attendee Cheta G. Emba ’15. “She offered a lot of encouragement and tips for how black women and women can make the most of the opportunities they are presented with. It was awesome.”
The Black Men’s Forum has previously conferred its Woman of the Year Award on honorees ranging from a poet to a corporate executive to the mayor of Cambridge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the auctioneer announced lot 51, hands flew into the air. The piece—Reverend Peter J. Gomes’s own Harvard College chair, which he received in honor of 25 years of service to the University—sold for $2,600, thirteen times its appraised value.
Along with 549 other lots, the chair was auctioned off on Saturday at the estate sale of the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, Harvard’s longtime Pusey Minister and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals.
Gomes, oft-described as Harvard’s spiritual leader, died on Feb. 28, 2011 at age 68 from a brain aneurysm and heart attack.
During his three and a half decades as Pusey minister, Gomes reached beyond Harvard’s gates, rising to national prominence as a gay black Republican minister. Gomes wrote several bestselling books and delivered prayers at the inaugurations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.
The auction, which was held at Grogan and Company in Dedham, Mass., drew Gomes’ longtime acquaintances as well as antique collectors. For many, it was another opportunity to celebrate the life of the late minister and to walk away with a piece to remind them of Gomes.
Trevor A. Potter ’78, a former usher in Memorial Church and an old friend of Gomes, traveled from Virginia to attend the auction. Potter said that the auction was an opportunity to catch up with the Memorial Church community from his undergraduate days.
“Peter was an old friend. I’ve known so many of the objects in the sale,” said Potter, who garnered national attention as the attorney for Stephen Colbert’s Super PAC. “All of Peter’s friends would like to come home with something.”
Andrew F. Saxe ’84 walked away with one of the more sought-after items—a mahogany sideboard.
“This piece is more sentimental. It’s part of Peter’s persona,” Saxe said of his new acquisition. “It’s strange to see everything here. Every piece has a little bit of emotion behind it. That’s the value of [this] piece.”
According to Grogan and Company President and Chief Auctioneer Michael B. Grogan, Gomes had eclectic collecting tastes. His collection included everything from lamp stands to religious icons to 19th century portraits of English royalty.
“He really was not a collector in the sense of seeking out rare and important things,” said Grogan. “He found things that were interesting in design.”
The most expensive item, a gilt metal and crystal chandelier, went for $6,000  while the least expensive, a chromolithograph, sold for $30.
In his search for unique pieces, Gomes was not a stickler for quality or physical condition.
“Good, come with some Elmer’s Glue,” joked Grogan after pounding the gavel for a Victorian chair in less than mint condition.
The Gomes auction, Grogan said, was like no other held at his auction house. The crowd, packed into a large room overflowing with antiques, was the largest that Grogan had seen in 20 years.
Maryellen Washienko, a regular attendee of Grogan and Company’s auctions, noticed a difference in the tone of the audience.
“The auction was very quiet and respectful. Peter’s quiet persona was watching over the individuals purchasing,” she said. “I was so happy to be here and delighted to be in the company of the group.”
At the end of the estate sale nothing remained—an unusual occurrence at the Grogan and Company auction house.
“Most of our buyers are professionals, dealers, and collectors. This was different. Half of these people were brand new to the auction,” Grogan said. “From our perspective it brought a lot new people to the arena.”
The auction raised more than $350,000 dollars. The proceeds will go to Gomes’s alma mater, Bates College.

Although the shows of New York Fashion Week ended more than a month ago, Harvard students had the opportunity to try out runway-ready looks at Eleganza’s Rent the Runway Trunk Show on Saturday afternoon.
The event, held in the Adams Upper Common Room, was the final event in Harvard’s first ever Fashion Week. This was the second year that Eleganza hosted the trunk show in conjunction with Rent the Runway. Rent The Runway is an online service created by two Harvard Business School alumni that applies the Netflix model to the fashion industry, offering short-term rentals of designer dresses to customers at a fraction of the retail price.
“It’s a great way to look fabulous without cluttering your closet,” said Schuyler L. Polk ’14, a producer of Eleganza 2012.
Saturday’s trunk show featured a rack of Rent the Runway dresses in various styles, colors, and sizes, which attendees were encouraged to try on.
Eleganza members were on hand to offer advice, guide coordinating decisions, and explain how the online service works.
Eleganza provided laptops at the event, enabling students who had found the perfect dress to begin the rental process, sign up for the website, or simply browse other gown options.
The event capped off Harvard’s inaugural Fashion Week, which featured a slew of events put on by a variety of fashion-oriented student groups.
At the kick-off event held on Wednesday in Harvard Hall, Identities screened “The September Issue,” a documentary following Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour as the magazine produced its 2007 fall fashion issue. The Vestis Council held their blog relaunch party on Thursday night, and the South Asian Association hosted Andaaz: A South Asian Fashion Show on Friday.
Organizers of Saturday’s trunk show said they were hopeful that Fashion Week would return in future years.
“I hope that it sticks around and evolves into more of a tradition,” said Polk. “Next year, maybe we could have a career fashion panel or another fashion show.”

When residents move back into the renovated Old Quincy in the fall of 2013 after its refurbishment, they will find flat-screen televisions waiting for them—courtesy of Harvard.
These screens—whose width has yet to be determined—and other furnishings are on display in a full-scale model of several rooms in revamped Old Quincy constructed by Harvard Planning and Project Management.
Tucked away three stories underground in an apartment parking garage adjacent to Harvard Business School, the mock-up is a hallway connecting a community bathroom and common room, a single bedroom, and a double bedroom. The set-up represents what administrators have dubbed a “cluster community”—a space in which 10 to 16 students share a common room and live in single or double bedrooms close by. These clusters will make up 50 percent of Old Quincy; the rest will be suites similar to the ones in which Quincy students currently live.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said that the cluster arrangement will eliminate walk-through bedrooms and increase the number of singles.
According to Steve Needham, a senior director for Harvard Planning and Project Management, all seniors and half of the juniors in the renovated building will be guaranteed a single bedroom.
The common rooms will feature non-operative fireplaces with wall jacks for students to connect their gaming systems and computers to the television screen, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Assistant Dean for Physical Resources Merle Bicknell.
Harvard will also furnish common rooms with seating, lamps, and a table composed of four separate moveable parts.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith characterized the mock-up as “the test project for the test project,” using the administration’s pet term for Old Quincy, the first step in Harvard’s ambitious plan to revamp all twelve Houses.
Administrators commissioned the mock-up, which took two months to build, to test whether certain elements of the rooms, designed in response to student feedback, function properly.
Students, tutors, House Masters, and other administrators have taken tours of the mock-up so that they can provide feedback on features such as the height of the lighting fixtures, the width of the desks, and the depth of the cubbies in the community bathroom.
Quincy House Committee co-chair Scott J. Yim ’13, one of nine Quincy residents who toured the mock-up last week, said that he and the other students suggested that administrators increase seating space in the common rooms, install bright lights in the bathrooms, and consider flat chairs in place of the existing rocking chairs.
Catherine G. Katz ’13, Yim’s co-chair who also toured the mock-up, said that she was most excited about the new bathroom design, which includes floor-to-ceiling toilet stall dividers that increase privacy and a new ventilation system.
Katz added that she was also looking forward to the common room televisions because she believes they will improve the social space.
“You may not need a TV, but it’s allowing for people to come together in a social setting where they might not have been able to do so before,” Katz said.
In an effort to promote sustainability, administrators said they aim to recycle as many of Old Quincy’s building materials as possible.
For instance, they plan to widen Old Quincy’s current doors by adding strips of wood to them rather than scrapping the doors altogether. The wider entrances will make Quincy fully wheelchair accessible.
“The general approach is to keep as much of the old building material as possible, if it’s still serviceable and if it will last,” said Mark R. Johnson, Harvard’s vice president for capital planning and project management. “The most sustainable option is always to use existing materials. To the extent that we use new materials, they will be subject to rigorous sustainability review.”
Katz said she thinks that incorporating parts of Old Quincy into the design maintains the historic aspects of the building as well.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences reduced the amount it spends on hiring external consulting firms by 30 percent between 2009 and 2011, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
The cuts coincided with budgeting constraints imposed by the FAS administration to cope with a $220 million deficit wrought by the 2008 financial crisis.
But Smith said the decision to cut back on external spending is also part of a broader effort to make better use of Harvard’s resources.
“We've been trying as much as possible to use internal expertise," Smith said.
According to former Dean of FAS William C. Kirby, external firms have in the past advised the school on issues ranging from architectural design in Allston to the current system of divisional deans that Kirby instituted in 2003.
Smith said that FAS has currently enlisted consultants to help determine the best structure and capabilities of the planned online student registration portal.
In the past, consultants have been called in to help with hiring searches for high-level administrative positions. But FAS is currently conducting two high-profile searches—one for a new dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and one for a new faculty director for the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning—without the help of external firms.
“We did explore [the possibility of using consultants], but what we could get out of them was not that beneficial,” Smith said about the Bok Center search.
When faculty members are appointed, “search firms have no input,” Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said.
Across the University, consultants have been hired to assist in large-scale projects such as House renewal and library restructuring.
But administrators have decided not to use consultants on some recent major initiatives. The merger of Central Administration Information Technology and FAS Information Technology into a single IT system—Harvard University Information Technology—was completed last June with next to no use of consultants.
“Restructuring the IT organization was a large-scale change, and I think in most organizations the way you would approach that would be to hire one of the large consulting firms,” said Anne H. Margulies, the University’s chief information officer. “Instead of having the organization feel the change is being done to us from the outside, we decided to use a process using the organization that we have.”
Margulies added, “It’s hard to get consultants who can work really effectively in higher education...Consultants most often come with solutions that work extremely well in the private sector.”

The price of a Harvard education continues to rise, with total costs for undergraduates increasing 3.5 percent for the 2012-2013 academic year—to $54,496.
As in the previous two years—which each saw tuition costs jump by 3.8 percent—Harvard has also announced a hike in financial aid available to students, to a record $172 million. This represents a 7.5 percent increase from the 2011-2012 financial aid budget of $160 million.
“Need-blind admissions, supported by generous financial aid, is the bedrock of Harvard’s effort to attract the most talented undergraduates in America and across the globe, regardless of their ability to pay,” said Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “A student’s economic circumstances should never be a barrier to attending Harvard College.”
Harvard awards aid solely on the basis of need and expects to provide financial assistance to more than 60 percent of the student population.
Average grants will exceed $41,000, with students on financial aid expected to pay an average of $12,000 towards tuition, room, board, and general fees.
“We are grateful for the continued leadership of Deans Smith and Hammonds and for their continued commitment to keeping a Harvard College education affordable for all students, regardless of means,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67 wrote in an email statement. “This policy enables the Admissions Office to recruit the most talented students in the nation and world.”
Harvard’s financial aid policies have been revised since this year’s financial aid budget was announced last spring. Whereas families that made less than $60,000 a year were not expected to contribute anything to their child's college education, that threshold has increased to $65,000—increasing the number of students who will be able to attend Harvard for free.
However, Harvard has reduced the level of assistance for families making between $150,000 and $180,000.
While families who made up to $180,000 could previously rely on assistance for about 90 to 100 percent of total costs, Harvard will now only guarantee that assistance to families who make up to $150,000. Need-based financial aid remains an option for some families who earn more than $150,000 a year.
The cost to attend Harvard first broke $50,000 in the 2010-2011 academic year. Total costs have since continued to rise steadily, although this year’s percentage increase is the lowest amongst the Ivy League institutions who have already announced undergraduate costs for the upcoming academic year. Dartmouth—whose total costs will hit $57,998—had the largest jump, by 4.8 percent, while the University of Pennsylvania increased costs by 3.9 percent, to $56,106.
Princeton will charge its students more than $50,000 for the first time in the school’s history, but the school’s total cost of $51,280—a 4.5 percent increase from this year—is still more affordable than at least half of its Ivy League peers.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 27
Due to an editing error, the headline of an earlier version of this article read "Tuition Will Reach $54,496." In fact, the total cost of attending Harvard in the 2012-13 school year will be $54,496. That figure includes tuition as well as room and board and other fees.

America is heading towards a health care crisis, Timothy Johnson, author of “The Truth about Getting Sick in America,” said in a lecture at the Science Center on Saturday afternoon.
Johnson warned that reforms are badly needed to prevent national bankruptcy at the event sponsored by the Harvard Clubs of the North Shore, Concord, and Andover.
Johnson, a former medical editor for ABC News, discussed the “big question” of why the United States does not have universal coverage or significantly better health outcomes, despite spending twice as much on health care as other industrialized nations. He pointed to unrealistic expectations among Americans that their health care will be convenient, compassionate, communicative, cutting-edge, and cheap or even cost free as possible culprits.
“Sooner or later we’re going to go off a cliff” with health care costs, he added, unless these expectations change.
To avoid the looming health care crisis, Johnson said, the country will need to institute a number of reforms, including establishing national standards for electronic medical records and improving primary care’s role as the “medical home” through the training of more primary care physicians and nurse practitioners.
In his lecture, Johnson acknowledged that many Americans fear government intervention in the health care market.
This tension featured prominently in the debate over the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. This week, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments about certain provisions of the Act, including the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion.
In defending government intervention in the health care industry, Johnson compared these debates with airline regulation, explaining that government oversight has not stifled competition in that market.
Health care is a moral issue as well, said Johnson. Forty-five thousand people die every year in the United States because they lack health care, he said, though the volume of complaints is incongruously small. If this many people died in airplane crashes every year, there would be serious protests, he added.
Organizers emphasized the timeliness of the event.
Robert Sackstein ’77, regional coordinator for the Harvard Alumni Association, described the issue of health care as “very important for the health of our country and for our own health.”
Richard Soo Hoo ’72, president of the Harvard Club of Andover, explained that the Harvard Clubs decided to hold this event because health care is a “hot topic,” and members “share the agreement that it is a concern.”

After taking a commanding lead, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team weathered a furious second-half run by Yale, holding on for a 7-5 victory.
The Crimson (3-4, 1-2 Ivy) reversed its recent trend of getting off to slow starts by taking a 7-0 first-half lead. The Bulldogs (2-4, 0-2) responded with a 5-0 run in the second frame, but Harvard was able to keep Yale off the board for the final 10 minutes of play, preserving the win Saturday afternoon at Reese Field in New   Haven, Conn.
“Every single game we have played this year has been a battle, and Saturday was no different,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “We are still struggling to play consistently, and it was a testament to Yale’s side that they were able to come out in the second half and battle back. On our side, we weren’t thrilled with the way we played [in the second half].”
While in past games the Crimson has struggled out of the gates, this time around Harvard came out strong, scoring four goals within the first eight minutes.
The Crimson got on the board first when junior Michaela Cyr put an unassisted goal past Bulldog goalie Erin McMullan a little under three minutes into the contest. Harvard proceeded to light up the scoreboard.
Junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen found the back of the net for her seventh goal of the year 5:08 into the game. Baskind was able to follow up with a goal of her own 79 seconds later before freshman Jamie Potter capped the run with a score 42 seconds later to give the Crimson a 4-0 advantage.
“I think we came out with energy, and we were moving off the ball well,” junior Danielle Tetreault said. “We attacked [the net] and created opportunities for one another.”
Harvard continued to put the pressure on Yale with a goal from Tetreault. Cyr and Baskind followed with their second goals on the day and their 11th and 12th goals of the season, respectively. Baskind’s goal with a little over a minute left to play in the first gave the Crimson a 7-0 lead.
According to Baskind, the Crimson, despite taking a seven-goal lead into the break, did not lose its focus.
“Because of the way our games have gone in the past, I think we did a good job of not getting ahead of ourselves and realizing that a 5-0, 7-0 score may not be as significant as it might seem on paper,” said Baskind, who finished with two ground balls and a draw control. “I think we did a good job of realizing that, but our execution in the second half didn’t really show it.”
Yale’s Devon Rhodes finally beat Harvard freshman goalkeeper Kelly Weiss, scoring off an assist from sophomore Jen DeVito.
The Bulldogs were then able to put away back-to-back goals off of free-position shots, the second of which brought Yale within four with 14:44 to go.
Rhodes got on the board again, and senior Caroline Crew followed with an unassisted score with just over 10 minutes left in the contest to pull Yale within two.
“I don’t think there was time to be nervous,” Baskind said. “We were just trying to focus on finishing out the game and maintaining a positive attitude. You can’t get too hung up on emotions, as hard as that may be. I was confident. We are a good team.”
The Crimson was able to compose itself as its defense held off the Bulldog attack, forcing three turnovers in the closing minutes.
“I think our defense had a very good game; we caused some turnovers, and we took care of the ball on offense and waited for good opportunities,” Tetreault said. “We had some turnovers [at the end of the game] that put us in trouble, but we had pressure defense that caused Yale to drop the ball, and it allowed us to get the ball back and take care of it for the win.”
The five goals were the fewest Crimson has allowed this season.

Being forced to move indoors after the rain cancelled original plans to play outside, the Harvard women’s tennis team (7-4) showed no signs of struggle this weekend, defeating both William and Mary (4-14) and Old Dominion (9-7, 2-2 CAA) on its road trip to Virginia.
The Crimson began the weekend with a 5-2 victory over William and Mary on Saturday before topping Old Dominion, 4-1, the following day.
“Unfortunately, the weather wasn’t ideal for tennis since it rained on both days,” junior co-captain Kristin Norton said. “We had to adjust…to play indoors, and we did a good job making that transition.”
Six different Harvard players recorded wins over the two matchups, while the tandem of senior Samantha Gridley and junior Camille Jania went 2-0 in doubles play.
Against William and Mary, the Crimson went 4-2 in singles play after winning two out of three doubles matches to take the doubles point.
Old Dominion, on the other hand, notched the first team point of the match by winning on both the No. 1 and No. 2 courts in doubles. Harvard shot back and won four straight singles matches to clinch the victory before play concluded.
“I think we played very well,” junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana said. “We had two very good wins. All of this is to prepare for the Ivy League that’s coming up in two weeks. Hopefully, this momentum will help carry us forward heading into the Ivies.”
HARVARD 4, OLD DOMINION 1
Coming off of a win the day before, the Crimson’s doubles play was not as strong, but its singles play led the visiting Harvard squad it to victory.
The morning began with two losses in doubles. Old Dominion’s Diana Ivanova and Aleksandra Mitrovska knocked down No. 33 duo Tachibana and Norton at the No. 1 spot, 8-1, while Gridley and Jania defeated their foe, 8-3, at the No. 3 position.
The doubles point came down to play on the No. 2 court, where sophomore Hannah Morrill and freshman Kelly Whelan took on Lady Monarchs Melissa Esnal Olguin and Juliana Pires. The match went into a tiebreaker, but Esnal Olguin and Pires finished ahead, 9-8 (8-6).
Down 1-0 to start, it was Harvard’s singles play that was the key to its matchup against the Lady Monarchs.
Playing until decision, the Crimson swept through its singles competition, winning all of its singles matches until play was stopped.
Norton topped her foe first, sweeping Mitrovska, 6-0, 6-0, at the No. 2 spot. Jania also decidedly beat her opponent Esnal Olguin at the No. 3 position, 6-0, 6-1.
Tachibana’s first set on the No. 1 court went into extra games, but she came out on top, 7-5, before winning the second set, 6-2 to give Harvard the 3-1 team advantage.
The Crimson’s match point came from Whelan at the No. 6 spot. The freshman took down Old Dominion’s Faith Atiso, 6-4, 6-1, to clinch the win.
HARVARD 5, WILLIAM AND MARY 2
After losing to the Tribe, 4-3, on Feb. 26 last year, the Crimson came out strong, winning the doubles point before taking four of six singles matches.
“To play William and Mary, we were ready for a battle,” Norton said. “We knew they were feisty. We got off to a great start by winning the doubles point and that gave us great momentum going into singles. This match really showed our team’s will to win.”
Morril and Whelan defeated their opponents in a close 8-6 bout, while Gridley and Jania handled their foes, 8-1.
Norton and Tachibana dropped their match to the Tribe’s No. 39 Maria Belaya and Jeltje Loomans, 8-3. The two doubles losses by Tachibana and Norton over the weekend were uncharacteristic for the duo.
“I think we just never really got into the match as quickly as we do usually,” Tachibana said. “But the fact that we had this problem before the Ivies is really good because we have two weeks to work on it.”
In singles, Tachibana was the first to defeat her opposition, 6-3, 6-1, at the No. 1 court. Gridley defeated William and Mary’s Hope Johnson, 6-2, 6-1, at the No. 5 spot, while Loomans got the best of Norton at the No. 2 position, 6-3, 6-1.
Harvard’s final wins came from a 6-1, 6-3 contest by Jania and a 3-6, 6-3, 10-4 rally by sophomore Natalie Blosser at the No. 3 and No. 4 spots, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Road woes continue for the Harvard baseball team. Despite amassing early leads in two of four games and keeping three contests within a run, the Crimson (1-16) dropped four tight matchups at Army (15-6) on Friday and Saturday, increasing its current losing streak to 11.
“As a whole, we played pretty well,” sophomore infielder Carlton Bailey said. “We just didn’t really get key hits when they were needed. But our deficits were by only one or two runs, so it wasn’t like we got blown out. We just didn’t produce when we needed to.”
Sophomore infielder Jake McGuiggan continued, “Eleven of our 16 losses have been by one or two runs. You could say we’re the best one-win team in the country. I think that bodes well for when we start Ivy games this weekend.”
Harvard has played its first 17 games on the road and will add five more to that number before finally returning to O’Donnell Field on April 4.
ARMY 7, HARVARD 6 (10 inn.)
With the Crimson down 6-4 in the eighth inning in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader, McGuiggan hit a timely double to drive in freshman centerfielder Mike Martin and sophomore left fielder Jack Colton, tying the score at six apiece. But Army broke the stalemate in the bottom of the 10th, closing out the series with a fourth straight win over the Crimson, 7-6, on what McGuiggan believed was a questionable call.
“It was bases loaded with one out, and obviously, if they score they win,” McGuiggan said. “They hit a ground ball to second baseman [Jeff Reynolds] who tried to tag the runner…. From where I was standing at shortstop, it looked like [the runner] stepped on the grass, but the umpire called him safe, the run scored, and they won.”
After Reynolds scored a run in the first, Army took over, outscoring Harvard, 5-1, in the first five frames. The Crimson started to stage a comeback in the sixth inning, as junior third baseman Kyle Larrow keyed a three-run frame for the Crimson with an RBI single down the right, plating Colton and sophomore first baseman Steven Dill. Martin scored the inning’s final run on McGuiggan’s sacrifice fly to center field.
Harvard tied it up in the eighth inning, but after a scoreless ninth, Army designated hitter Mike McCants grounded out to drive in the winning run.
ARMY 1, HARVARD 0
Earlier on Saturday, Harvard held Army scoreless for all but one inning, falling once again as a third-inning RBI single lifted Army to a 1-0 victory.
Because the contest was the first in the day’s twinbill, the game was only seven innings as opposed to the customary nine.
“It’s tough to play two less innings, especially when you lose 1-0,” McGuiggan said. “If this game was the second game, we would have six more outs to deal with and potentially be able to get a run across. Coach always says, ‘It’s not really a baseball game unless it’s nine innings.’”
Both of the Crimson’s  two hits in the contest came off the bat of shortstop Carlton Bailey. Junior captain Andrew Ferreira took the loss for Harvard after 4.2 innings and four strikeouts.
“I’m sure the rest of the team feels this way too, but it’s pretty frustrating,” Bailey said of the squad’s close losses. “We’re always right there—a hit away—from taking games away from very good teams. We’re doing all we can in practice to make sure we can get that extra hit, so instead of losing by one, we can win by one or more.”
ARMY 5, HARVARD 4
In the second game of Friday’s doubleheader, the Crimson led, 4-0, heading into the bottom of the seventh. But five straight Army runs that inning sealed a comeback win for the Black Knights, 5-4.
Harvard scored three runs on two hits in the fourth inning, beginning with a sacrifice fly from McGuiggan to drive home Reynolds. Freshman designated hitter Ethan Ferreira homered into left center later in the frame, knocking home Colton. Ferreira’s two hits and two RBI led the team in both categories.
Harvard stretched its lead to four in the top of the seventh, as McGuiggan scored on a pitching error. On his six innings on the mound. junior Joey Novak helped the Crimson hold the lead, shutting out the Black Knights while allowing just three hits.
But the Harvard pitching staff struggled in the seventh, giving up five runs on three hits in the inning to seal the loss.
ARMY 4, HARVARD 2
The Crimson started off slowly in the first contest of the weekend, as the Black Knights scored three runs in the first inning and eventually came away with the win, 4-2, on Friday afternoon.
Harvard got the game to within one run in the fifth, as Ferreira batted in McGuiggan and Bailey with a double to left center. But Army scored again in the bottom of that same inning, pushing its lead to two runs, a deficit from which the Crimson would not recover.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanks to dominant play on the mound by both teams, the Harvard softball team returns to campus with two wins and two losses following its weekend series against Lehigh.
The Crimson (12-6) played in doubleheaders on Saturday and Sunday, splitting the four games with the Mountain Hawks (13-13), each of which proved to be a pitching duel.  Over the weekend, both teams limited each other to four total runs.
“Our pitching definitely kept us in the games,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said.  “[Sophomore] Laura Ricciardone threw especially well on Sunday and shut them out. We were really effective against them on Saturday also.... They had outstanding pitching as well.”
But Allard believes that the team will need to focus on hitting this week in order to address the offensive struggles.
“The games we won, we got people on base, and we got some timely hits,” Allard says. “In the two games that we got shut out, we just couldn’t generate any offense.  We definitely struggled at the plate this weekend, and that’s something to work on heading into next weekend.”
HARVARD 1, LEHIGH 0
After dropping the first game of the Sunday double header, Harvard concluded the weekend on a strong note, defeating Lehigh, 1-0.
The Sunday afternoon game proved to be the tightest pitching duel of the weekend, as no team scored a run during the regular seven innings of play.
The Crimson needed two extra innings to find its offense. In the top of the ninth, sophomore outfielder Shelbi Olson doubled down the left field line.  She advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt from senior Infielder Whitney Shaw before scoring on groundout to second by freshman Emily Gusse.
Sophomore Pitcher Laura Ricciardone sealed the game for the Crimson in the bottom of the ninth, holding her opponents to eight hits in the complete-game shutout.
“Grit and determination from the entire team [allowed us to win] that game,” senior infielder Jane Alexander said.  “Laura wasn’t feeling well and displayed a lot of heart on the mound.  I don’t think she missed a spot the entire game. And we as a team were inspired by her efforts.  We had to manufacture a run, and finally in the ninth we were able to do that.”
LEHIGH 2, HARVARD 0
Senior Rachel Brown picked up her second loss of the season on Sunday morning when the Crimson fell to Lehigh, 2-0.  She pitched six innings for Harvard, allowing two runs and six hits.
The Mountain Hawks took the lead during the bottom of the fifth inning. They capitalized off of a single, sacrifice bunt, and another single when senior Audra Wood scored the first run of the game for the home team.  A double to left brought in another runner, giving Lehigh the 2-0 lead and the eventual victory.
LEHIGH 1, HARVARD 0
Ricciardone took the mound for Harvard in the second game of the Saturday double header and, as she did the following day, picked apart Lehigh, throwing five scoreless innings.
But the Crimson batters had no answer for Lehigh’s pitcher, either.  The tight game came down to the bottom of the sixth, when a hit batter and a sacrifice bunt put a Mountain Hawk runner on second.  The home team took advantage of the game’s only offense when the next batter singled to right, bringing the runner in for the game-winning score.
“Laura threw an amazing game in the second game on Saturday and unfortunately we didn’t have the run support [to match her effort],” Alexander said.
HARVARD 3, LEHIGH 1
Harvard got off to a good start in its weekend series with a 3-1 win over Lehigh. Brown pitched a strong game for the Crimson, recording eight strikeouts through the first three innings.
In the top of the fourth, Harvard senior infielder Jane Alexander sparked the Crimson offense with a triple to right center.  Sophomore Kasey Lange brought her home on the next at bat when she hit a double down the left field line. Harvard tacked on another run in the inning when freshman infielder Katherine Lantz knocked Lange home.
The game reverted to a pitching duel until the top of the seventh, when Ricciardone led off with a single.  Shelbi Olson’s RBI single to the middle padded Harvard’s lead, 3-0.  Though the Mountain Hawks responded with a run in the bottom of the last inning, the Crimson held on for the 3-1 win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Braving blustery and choppy conditions on the Charles River on Saturday morning, the No. 12 Radcliffe heavyweight crew out-rowed Boston-area rivals to take first place at the sixth annual Beanpot in the first race of the spring season.
Facing Boston College, Boston University, MIT, and Northeastern, all five Crimson heavyweight crews fared well against their local rivals, with four notching victories to help Harvard begin the spring regular season on the right note.
“I thought we had a really strong performance,” Harvard coach Liz O’Leary said. “When you start off the season with four of your five boats [winning] in the regatta, it’s terrific.”
With the start of its race, the Radcliffe first varsity eight launched off the starting line and powered down the course despite brisk tailwinds that churned the water on the river and provided challenging conditions for all crews sprinting on the Charles.
But the Black and White handled both the elements and the local rivals as the Radcliffe 1V finished the course with a winning time of 6:25.9—the Black and White’s fastest Beanpot finish in three years.
BU completed the course 6.2 seconds behind with a time of 6:32.1. In the battle for third place, Northeastern was able to edge out MIT. The Huskies finished 0.6 seconds ahead of the Engineers with a time of 6:38.3.
BC finished last, 15.2 seconds behind MIT with a time of 6:54.1.
O’Leary cited this past winter’s warmer temperatures as an influence in the team’s high level of performance this early in the season.
“The mild winter that we had gave us the opportunity to get in a lot of practice on the river, and it showed in our races,” O’Leary said. “Everyone performed as well as I could have expected at this time of the year. Hopefully we can continue to make good progress, but I’m proud of the performance that we had overall, especially at this point of the season.”
With a first-place finish in the 1V, combined with victories in the 2V, varsity four A, and the varsity four B, Radcliffe laid claim to its fifth Beanpot title in six years and also retained ownership of its head-to-head trophies—the Allen-DeWolfe Trophy and Rowlands Cup—for its victories against BU and Northeastern, respectively.
During the second varsity eight race, the Radcliffe 2V established an imposing lead over the field early on and never looked back, cruising to a comfortable victory. The Black and White 2V went on to post a winning time of 6:34.2, nearly 20 seconds ahead of its competitors. Northeastern, BU, and BC finished in quick succession, placing second, third, and fourth with times of 6:54.0, 6:57.5, and 6:58.0, respectively. The MIT 2V finished last with a time of 7.08.2.
“Overall, we had a really exciting day. It was fun being back in race mode, and I’m proud of the whole team,” junior rower Marisa D’Orsogna said. “Doing well here on our home course in our first race has set us up to keep working hard for the rest of our season as well.”
The Radcliffe varsity four A and varsity four B crews also stormed away to wide-margin victories, with the varsity four A winning by more than 10 seconds in 7:28.8 while the varsity four B finished 12 seconds faster than its rivals with a time of 7:44.7.
In the final race of the day, the third varsity eight race, the Black and White 3V started off strong but was unable to keep up with the rapid strokes of BC and Northeastern, which finished in first and second, respectively. In the race, the Radcliffe 3V finished last, just under 14 seconds behind in the first-place Eagles.
After strong performances during the fall season and this year’s season-opening Beanpot Regatta, the Black and White just might have found the momentum builder it needs as it looks ahead to its highly touted head-to-head matchup against national defending champions Brown, set to take place next weekend in Providence, R.I.
“[Brown-Harvard] will be an exciting race to watch,” O’Leary said. “It will live right up to what it has always been. I have tremendous respect for Brown, and they are the national champions right now, so they will be a formidable opponent for us next weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A youthful Harvard men’s swimming team wrapped up a strong weekend at the NCAA Championships in Seattle, Wash., on Saturday, finishing the meet with a total of eight All-American honors between the swimming and diving teams.
“We came into the season and wanted to do something special,” freshman Zach Walters said.
The Crimson’s relay teams gave Harvard its best finishes of the meet. The team of freshmen Griffin Schumacher and Chuck Katis and sophomores Oliver Lee and Chris Satterthwaite placed 16th in the 400-yard free relay with a time of 2:55.18; Schumacher, Katis, Satterthwaite, and Walters placed 13th in the 800 free as well, clocking in at 6:27.94.
“It’s the first time we’ve taken a relay to the NCAAs in a number of years, so it’s pretty exciting,” Walters said. “And going into the season, we weren’t expected to do nearly that well in either of them, so we are very happy with the outcome of the season.”
All five Crimson representatives at the meet were either freshmen or sophomores.
“We’re excited to take our competition to a national level,” Schumacher said. “We’re making huge gains and hopefully all this young talent we have will grow in the next few years. We can do huge things.”
With back-to-back talented recruiting classes, the Crimson began taking steps towards attaining that sought-after national success with a challenging 2011-12 schedule. This season, Harvard broke away from its Ancient Eight competitors to face off in a head-to-head meet against national power Ohio State in January and travel down to the North Carolina Invitational in November, where it finished fifth.
The current crop of Crimson swimmers believes that the program’s ascension will only continue in the future.
“This is a stepping stone for years to come,” Schumacher said. “In a few years, we can be a top-15 team.”
The relay teams qualified for the NCAAs at the Ivy League Championships, hosted by Princeton on March 1, where they placed second after the host Tigers.
Satterthwaite shined at the event. He won the 50-, 100-, and 200-meter freestyle races to earn the Swimmer of the Meet accolade.
The pair of Harvard relay teams continued their success in national, where they were part of seven top-25 finishes for the Crimson. Satterthwaite finished 22nd in the 100 free and Katis came in 25th in the 200 breast.
Harvard’s 200 free team of Lee, Satterthwaite, Schumacher, and Walters—which finished second at the Ivies to Princeton despite posting a school record time of 1:19.17—hit the wall at 1:20.27 at NCAAs. This time, the squad placed two spots above the Tigers.
“I think we all saw [this success] coming early on,” Walters said. “I don’t think we expected to do this well, though. It’s always a goal of ours to get some individuals to NCAAs, and once we got to the end of the season and built confidence, we knew we had a shot at bringing a relay.”
The five Harvard swimmers competing at the NCAAs were the Crimson’s first since All-American and 2012 United States Olympian Alex Meyer ’10 represented Harvard two years ago.
“I don’t think anyone else in the nation was expecting us to bring five people, but we knew we had a shot, and we worked towards it,” Walters said.
Harvard, coached by longtime coach Tim Murphy, has had a total of 152 All-Americans in program history, 36 under Murphy. The team has had at least one in 12 of Murphy’s 14 seasons.
Three Crimson All-American divers who competed at the NCAA Diving Championships in early March round out the eight All-Americans on Harvard’s swimming and diving team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team may have been playing on a new coast, but the Crimson didn’t miss a beat. Returning to the East after a three-game West-Coast trip, the Crimson continued its winning ways, dropping conference rival Sacred Heart in a 3-1 victory at the Pitt Center in Fairfield,  Conn., on Saturday.
Harvard (14-3, 6-2 EIVA), which defeated the Pioneers (4-17, 1-9 EIVA) in straight sets on Feb. 25, found itself even with Sacred Heart after two games. But the Crimson closed out the final two sets to claim the win.
“It was our first game since playing in California, and we had been playing well since then, so we had high expectations,” sophomore outside hitter Nick Madden said. “We came out flat and dropped a game, but we turned it around and found a way to win.”
Harvard started hot, storming out to a 7-2 lead in the opening set and prompting the Pioneers to call a timeout.
And though a kill from co-captain Matt Jones gave the Crimson the first point out of the timeout, Sacred Heart clawed back into the game, bringing the score to 9-7.
The teams traded runs for the rest of the set, but Harvard maintained a small cushion throughout, taking the set, 25-22.
The second set began with the two teams tightly matched. But after several Crimson errors and strong offensive play from the Pioneers, Sacred Heart jumped out to a 16-12 lead, prompting Harvard coach Brian Baise to call a timeout.
Coming out of the break, the Crimson could not find a way back into the set, as the Pioneers marched on to a 25-16 win to tie the match.
“They were serving well and our passing was definitely struggling a little bit,” sophomore libero Chris Gibbons said. “We did make quite a few uncharacteristic hitting errors. But luckily we were able to turn it around, focus in on passing, and control that side of the ball better. Then our hitters got back into rhythm after having a few slip-ups.”
The third set was close throughout, with the conference foes battling for control of the game.
Jones, who notched five of his 12 kills in the third set, led Harvard on the offensive side. The co-captain was supported by freshman outside hitter DJ White, who added four kills of his own in the third frame.
Defensively, Gibbons marshaled the team, as the sophomore’s 17 digs on the day maintained possession for the Crimson at crucial moments.
“[Gibbons] played out of his mind,” Madden said. “But our blocking wasn’t very good, so defensively it kind of averaged out.”
“Defensively, Coach always does a good job of scouting out the other team and seeing where their tendencies are in terms of hitting,” Gibbons said. “Basically, it’s all about being able to execute that game plan.”
With Harvard holding a slight lead at 19-18, Sacred Heart called a timeout to regroup for the set’s final points. But out of the timeout, the Crimson was able to edge its way to a narrow 25-22 win.
The fourth set started much the same way, with the teams trading points until Harvard launched a 7-1 run to grab a commanding 21-15 lead. The Pioneers took two timeouts in hopes of detracting from the Crimson’s momentum, but Harvard was able to hold out for the 25-18 victory.
The win gives the Crimson momentum going into the final stretch of its season. Sitting in second place in the EIVA standings with a game advantage on St. Francis, Harvard will face only conference opponents for the rest of the regular season.
“The mindset right now is an aggressive one,” Gibbons said. “We can’t slip up, and we’re gunning for [first-place] Penn  State next time we come across them. They’re a good team, but we’ve been playing well, and I think we can surprise them.”
The Crimson returns to the Malkin Athletic Center next weekend for the team’s last home games of the season against New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers.
Saturday’s game against NJIT will serve as the team’s senior night, where co-captains Jones and Dan Schreff will be honored.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 1 Harvard men’s lightweight crew couldn’t have asked for a much better start to its spring season.
The Crimson swept all four races against Delaware on Saturday morning at Harvard’s home course on the Charles River. With the victory, the Crimson recorded its 20th straight win in the dual season. Both the 2010 and 2011 lightweight crews went undefeated in head-to-head racing.
The strong tailwinds that grew in intensity throughout the morning quickly became a factor in Saturday’s races.
“There was a wind that made the conditions tougher and tougher as the race went on,” said captain Tom Nesel, the six seat of the second varsity eight. I think all crews came out of the gates pretty fast and realized that it was going to be a fast race.”
The second varsity race was the closest of the morning, with the Crimson defeating the Blue Hens by a margin of 4.7 seconds. Harvard finished the course in 6:06.9.
The race seemed to be decided in favor of the Crimson until a mishap slowed down the boat’s pace.
“With about 250 meters to go, one of our oarsman caught a crab, which stopped the boat speed,” Nesel said. “We had to pick it back up.”
But the incident did not ultimately influence the outcome of the race.
“We had a pretty confident lead,” Nesel said. “We had that little setback with the crab, but after that we pulled back away again. We struggled quite a bit in the tougher conditions in the second half of the race, but we ended up pulling through.”
Nesel stressed the importance of maintaining mental toughness in the most difficult stretches of the race, especially in strong winds.  This allowed Harvard to hold on to its lead and come away from the race with a win.
“I was just trying to think clearly because there was a lot going on physically,” the captain said. “The more technical aspects of the stroke that you can think of during the hardest part of the race, the better you can perform.”
The first varsity eight’s race was much more one-sided. The Crimson finished in 5:49.9 en route to a 23.2-second victory over the Delaware crew.
“I thought it was a really good start to the season, especially because we were able to accomplish exactly what we set out to do with our race strategies,” senior coxswain Angela Chang said. “We just focused on our own race and doing the best that we could.”
The Harvard crew pulled away for an early open-water lead in the first 500-meter stretch of the race.
“One of our goals was to focus on our boat for the first 500, just moving well and being able to handle the cross-wind conditions,” Chang said. “We stayed calm and focused on the speed of our own boat early on.”
The Crimson freshmen also had a successful start to their first dual-racing season. The freshman eight finished its race in 6:03.6, defeating the Blue Hens by a margin of 12.6 seconds. The Harvard A entry of the freshman fours crossed the finish line in 6:55.2.
With Harvard’s first Ivy League matchups two weeks down the road, Delaware was an important preparatory race.
“It was definitely good to get a 2000-meter race in the legs,” Nesel said. “We hadn’t done it yet, and it is a very unique experience.  Getting warm in the legs for our Ivy opener in two weeks is important both mentally and physically.”
Chang also discussed the importance of Saturday’s win in boosting the team’s morale and motivation for improvement.
“I think it gave us confidence that what we are working really hard on every day is actually working,” Chang said. “We have two weeks until the Ivy opener, and we are just going to work on getting faster and faster every day.”
The Crimson lightweight crew will take on Cornell and Penn in Ithaca on April 7, when it will look to stretch its record of consecutive dual-season wins.
“We want to win every race we enter,” Nesel said. “We have had precedent in the past two years: Varsity has had undefeated regular seasons, and last year we had a Sprints Championship.  We want to keep that momentum going all the way to the National Championships in June this year.”

The Harvard fencing team capped off its season with a sixth-place finish at the NCAA Championships over the weekend in Columbus, Ohio. Co-captain Valentin Staller was among six All-Americans for the Crimson and led the team with a second-place finish in the sabre.
As a team, the Crimson finished with 136 points. Princeton, the highest placing Ivy team, finished in second (161 points) behind the host, Ohio  State (181 points).
“I think we performed pretty well considering the pressure,” freshman Peregrine Badger said. “Most people who had trouble on the first day were able to come back and perform well on the second.”
“I’m really proud of all the guys,” Staller said. “We all did very well. We had three guys on the podium in each of the weapons, and I think that’s the first time we’ve done that as a team in the time I’ve been here. Though it would have been nicer to finish higher than sixth, I think, considering the tough competition we came up against this year, we did pretty well.”
Staller’s three-day charge to the podium began with his 15 victories and plus-22 score differential in the round-robin stage—enough to earn the senior a four seed in the championship round.
In the knockout stage of the sabre championship, Staller earned a final-round berth following his 15-12 victory over No. 1 seed Max Stearns of Ohio State.
“[Stearns] is a great fencer, and I just had a good game plan, and I stuck to it through the tournament. I guess I had never been in that setting before, in the final round, with a lot of people watching, with cameras, but I was able to keep cool despite it and focus on my fencing.”
But in the final round, Staller came up short against No. 2 seed Aleksander Ochocki of Penn State, falling, 15-11. Despite coming up short in the final round, Staller’s second-place finish in his last NCAA tournament capped off an illustrious fencing career with the Crimson.
“[Ochocki] was fencing great,” Staller said. “It was a tough matchup for me.... He just had the extra edge necessary in the final round. I went for some big actions, some of them I got, but most of them I didn’t.”
Entering the NCAA tournament having qualified the maximum number of fencers—12—for the second straight year, Harvard looked primed to make a title run for any of the six individual titles up for grabs this weekend.
In the men’s sabre, Staller’s second-place finish was supplemented by sophomore Eric Arzoian’s nine wins, enough to earn him 18th place.
In the epee, Badger took sixth in his first NCAA tournament appearance, giving him second-team All-American honors. For the weekend, Badger tallied 16 victories with a plus-19 score differential.
The rookie finished just two wins shy of entering the championship round in the epee.
Badger’s fellow epeeist, senior James Hawrot, finished the NCAA tournament and his Crimson fencing career with eight wins. giving him the 20 spot in the individual standings at the end of the competition.
On the women’s side, senior Caroline Vloka finished in fifth place in the sabre, enough for second-team All-American honors.
Freshman Kara Lee’s nine victories over the three-day tournament earned her 17th.
In the foil, sophomore Alexandra Kiefer, who claimed the NCAA individual championship as a rookie in 2011, finished in 11th place, earning an All-American honorable mention in the process.
Junior Kathy Chou finished with six victories in 23rd place.
In the epee, freshman Emma Vaggo and junior Nadia Eldeib were the top finishers for the Crimson, ending the tournament in 14th and 18th place, respectively.
Last season, the Crimson also finished sixth in the team standings, posting 137 points at the event.

On Saturday night, freshman blocking groups gathered in the Cambridge Queen's Head Pub to compete in Harvard spin-offs of popular game shows.
The teams battled it out in rounds of Newlyblocked, Minute-to-Win-It, and Freshman Feud. The event was funded by the Freshmen Class Council (FCC), a newly formed subdivision of the Undergraduate Cou­­ncil that aims to finance social events for the freshman class.
While playing Newlyblocked, participants were tested on how well they knew their blockmates. Minute-to-Win-It required freshmen to complete trivial tasks (such as stacking chapstick tubes with chopsticks) in under 60 seconds. Freshman Feud tested students' knowledge of Harvard trivia.
"The event was an attempt to get [FCC's] name out there so that people are aware that sources do exist for social funding on campus," said Alejandro A. Jimenez Jaramillo '15, a member of the FCC who hosted the evening's activities.
In the future, the FCC plans to provide funding and support for student-proposed social events. "If anyone has an idea for an event...we will be distributing money to make it happen if it sounds reasonable," said Jimenez Jaramillo, who added that events need to attract at least 50 freshmen in order to receive funding. "You can have the event and then ask us to pay you back for it if it had over 50 freshmen, or you can ask for upfront funding."
Valentina I. Perez '15 participated in Newlyblocked with her blockmates and linkmates. "I'm happy with how we did because we knew some random things about each other," she said. "I would definitely look forward to other things like that."

The organizers of Harvard's first annual Sex Week hope to spark a campus-wide discussion on issues ranging from sexual health and communication to gender identification and sexuality. Sex Week, which runs through Saturday, has well over twenty different events planned. From abstinence to BDSM, there is something for everyone. And with event names like these, we are confident students will have plenty to talk about. Without further ado, five of the most colorful events, in chronological order:
Sex-Positivity and Slut-Pride: Sex Tips for a Modern World from Good Vibrations
Monday 12 p.m., Wasserstein Hall, West Milstein A
Good Vibrations (no, not the song) will be demoing lube and showing off sex toys after a short talk on sex-positivity. Come for the free food, if not for the vibrators.

8th Annual Female Orgasm Seminar
Saturday 8-10 p.m., Science Center B

Announcement of this year's Yardfest lineup (ever the Billboard Hit, never the Dev) was met with overwhelming indifference on campus. But to put Das Racist and the Cataracs in context, Flyby takes a look at how the other Ivies will be jamming.
University of Pennsylvania: This year's Spring Fling concert will start on Friday, Apr. 13, and escalate to carnival-style celebrations over the course of two days. The electropop band Passion Pit (which hails from our very own Cambridge, MA) will open for headliner Tiesto.
Brown: On Apr. 20, Brown will welcome actor-turned-rapper Childish Gambino to their Main Green alongside Sepalcure and What Cheer? Brigade. The big night is followed by Saturday's concert involving The Glitch Mob, Cam'ron, and Twin Shadow.
Cornell: Cornell's Slope Day (a homage to the giant grassy slope where the main concert takes place) has a lot to live up to. Last year's show saw Nelly whip crowds into a frenzy; the year prior, Grammy-nominated rapper Drake took to the stage. This year's concert is scheduled to take place May 4, and the lineup has yet to be announced.
Princeton: Princeton's end-of-year celebrations take the form of a three-day extravaganza culminating in lawn parties during which many eating clubs open up their lawns and hire entertainment. Last year the New Jersey campus welcomed Wiz Khalifa, and previous acts include The Roots and B.O.B. This year's event is set to take place in early May, but the performers have not yet been announced.
Yale: According to The Yale Daily Herald, students have mixed reactions to Yale's Spring Fling lineup, which was leaked last week and will include T-Pain, Passion Pit, and DJ 3LAU. Acts from previous years have included Mike Posner, MGMT and N.E.R.D.
Columbia: Columbia's week-long Bacchanal celebrations remain without a grand finale, though a headlining act is is due to be announced soon. In previous years, Vampire Weekend (whose band members met while at Columbia), Kanye West, and comedian Bob Saget have taken the stage.
Dartmouth: Scheduled for May 19, Dartmouth's Green Key Weekend still seems a long way away. Weekends from years gone by have featured piano smashing contests, chariot races and general debauchery, and we wait with bated breath to see how this year's installment plays out.

Upon the recent release of "The Hunger Games," Flyby asked seven Harvard students to describe the movie in seven words. Most students asked to remain anonymous, due to what they termed the pressure of reviewing the megahit.
'The Hunger Games,' in seven words from seven undergraduates:
An unnerving yet poignant revisitation of "1984."
Strength, love, sacrifice. You'll laugh and cry.
Hard to handle, hard to stomach. Hard.
Less great than the book, but great.
I needed a whole lot of tissues.
Better than I could have ever dreamed.
The odds were ever in its favor.

Just because the weather's no longer scorching doesn't mean the freshmen aren't.
