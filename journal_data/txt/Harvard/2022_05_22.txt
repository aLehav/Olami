“What’s wrong with milking cows and making cheese?” cries petulant preteen Pietro to his mother in the Italian drama “Le Otto Montagne,” or “The Eight Mountains.” In this scene, protagonist Pietro (Lupo Barbiero) defends the rural lifestyle of his best friend, insisting that moving from the mountains to the city “would ruin Bruno.” This argument from Pietro speaks to the questions at the heart of this deeply contemplative film — where is it that we belong in the world, and how are we defined by those places if we find them? In portraying the unique bond between Bruno and Pietro over the years, which always remains tied to the mountains of the Italian Alps where they first met, directors Charlotte Vandermeersch and Felix Van Groeningen’s latest film offers bittersweet reflections on the intimacy of friendship and what it means for humans to fit into nature.
Based on the novel of the same name by Paolo Cognetti, “Le Otto Montagne” premiered on May 18 at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival. At the start of the film, Pietro is eleven years old and has just moved to a rustic rural village with his mother for the summer. He is soon introduced to Bruno, the so-called “last child in the village.” They become fast friends, and this first act of the film is a thoughtful, if subdued, exploration of the playfully intimate friendships between young children.
Beautifully shot vignettes of Bruno and Pietro’s adventures in the sundrenched countryside pull viewers into their tender relationship. They swim together in roaring waterfalls and pristine lakes, splashing each other with carefree laughter; they play with cows and run through the lush summer grass. This exposition is portrayed with a stunning intimacy. The audience can immediately understand the pureness of their bond, which is grounded in their curious exploration of the natural world around them. For years, they spend their summers together in this way, always returning to their easy dynamic after seasons spent apart.
This first act also establishes the film’s meandering pace. “Le Otto Montagne” moves slowly, which aligns with the film’s thoughtful tone and storyline, but at times weakens its ability to captivate audiences. Still, it’s ultimately moving to see how the narrative traces Bruno and Pietro’s shifting relationship over several decades. Both boys have strained relationships with their fathers, and aim to be nothing like them. Because of their families and their own opposing desires, they end up losing touch for years. They finally reconnect in their early thirties, portrayed as adults by Luca Marinelli and Alessandro Borghi. Pietro and Bruno reunite at the mountains where they shared all those precious childhood memories, now grizzled men with full beards and flannel shirts.
Marinelli and Borghi bring a natural warmth to their complicated characters, and there is noticeable chemistry between them as they fall into the old rhythms of their friendship. Pietro and Bruno don’t have to say too many words to communicate with each other; while they differ in some ways, they are ultimately tethered by some unknowable force, and their dedication to each other is heartwarming. The poignant script from Vandermeesch and Groeningen also includes subtle but clever moments that mirror earlier scenes from their childhood.
Although “Le Otto Montagne” isn’t overwhelmingly exciting, it raises powerful existential questions in the portrayal of Bruno and Pietro as foils. While Pietro is restless to see the world, Bruno is confident that he belongs nowhere else but the mountains — he is a “montanaro” through and through, refusing to leave his home. Throughout the film, the mountains are characters themselves, often captured in striking wide shots that render the protagonists small, almost unnoticeable facets of these sweeping landscapes. The film also showcases songs composed by folk artist Daniel Norgren, whose crooning acoustic ballads provide the perfect soundtrack for these meditative scenes.
“Le Otto Montagne” packages profound messages into seemingly mundane interactions between family and friends. In one scene soon after their reunion, Pietro asks Bruno how long it would take to peak Mount Grenon; Bruno tells him to go climb it right then and there. Pietro ascends the rocky mountainside with an astounding lightness to his footsteps, like weight is lifted off his shoulders with every step he takes. When he reaches the top, he dances and yells to Bruno at the bottom; his friend responds by calling him “Berio,” his childhood nickname for him. Even with its slow pacing and simplistic plot, there are a myriad of powerful moments, both lighthearted and tragic, that are emotionally resonant throughout the film. Audiences are left with a myriad of questions that are unanswerable yet nevertheless worth pondering.

The year is 1980 — The Sugarhill Gang is on tour, the construction of Disney World’s Epcot Center is underway, and the Trump family owns a disproportionate amount of New York City real estate. This is the precise time period in which James Gray’s new drama “Armageddon Time,” which premiered on May 19 at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, takes place. Largely based on Gray’s own experiences growing up in Queens, the film follows sixth grader Paul Graff as he navigates coming of age in the political and social atmosphere of 1980s New York. The story addresses issues of oppression and privilege while also delving into the complicated dynamics of Paul’s flawed yet loving family. Balancing these two narrative threads is a difficult task, but the nuanced performances from the all-star cast provide an emotional core to Gray’s deeply honest script. In telling a fictionalized version of his own childhood, he intelligently illuminates how the personal and the socio-political intertwine to shape who a person becomes in their impressionable years.
Like many other sixth graders, Paul is bratty and naive, yet also loving and playful. All of these characteristics are vividly brought to life by the expressive Banks Repeta. The film follows Paul through several months of his sixth grade year, beginning at a local public school and switching in the middle of the term to a private school. This transition has a good deal to do with his friendship with a boy named Johnny (Jaylinn Webb) from his public school, who happens to be Black — a fact that various characters repeatedly point out. While Johnny likes The Sugarhill Gang and Paul likes The Beatles, they quickly become close friends. Through the portrayal of Paul and Johnny’s friendship, “Armageddon Time” provides revealing commentary on white privilege in the U.S., with a focus on race relations in the ’80s with the rise of Reagan-era conservatism.
Based on a real friendship from Gray’s childhood, Paul and Johnny share an endearing naïveté: Paul dreams of being an artist while Johnny hopes to join NASA. Webb imbues Johnny, who has a troubled home life, with both sensitivity and depth as his character faces increasingly stressful situations. The boys get into their fair share of trouble together, and Johnny consistently faces greater consequences for their actions than Paul. Their friendship is a candid reflection of how systems of oppression are strategically rigged against people of color, and the film shows the interpersonal costs of this devastating inequality.
After getting in trouble with Johnny, Paul’s family sends him to a private school where people like Maryanne Trump (Jessica Chastain) deliver speeches. Here, Gray clearly shows the class stratification of the era and reveals the exclusive pool of privileged children who are set up on the fast track to success — though Maryanne Trump insists that they have earned their success and they don’t ever take “handouts.” When elections are brought up at this assembly, the overwhelmingly white crowd of students chants “Reagan, Reagan, Reagan!” It is a starkly different world from Paul’s public school, and he feels unsettled there, especially when other students casually drop racial epithets.
At a press conference the day after the premiere of the film at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, Gray discussed at length his thoughts on capitalism and white privilege which color the film itself: “How did we get here? With everything owned by two people and a bunch of authoritarians who are trying to take over the planet?”
In a sea of imperfect people and moral ambiguity, Paul’s grandfather is the voice of reason in “Armageddon Time.” Played by Anthony Hopkins, he seems to be the only one who truly understands Paul, and their closely observed bond is a highlight of the film. As charming as ever, Hopkins crackles with warmth as the loving patriarch who grounds the family with his guiding wisdom. Though it’s unclear why his character seems to be a perfect saint while his family members are flawed, he nevertheless deepens the emotional arc of the film with his electric spark and bravado. In one powerful scene, he recounts the story of how his mother’s parents were killed in Ukraine in a brutal act of antisemitism. “Remember your past,” he tells Paul. In another scene, he encourages Paul to speak up when kids at his private school make racist comments about people of color.
Paul Graff’s caring but imperfect parents, brought to life by the immensely talented duo of Anne Hathaway and Jeremy Strong, also strengthen the film. They are very much written as reflections of their era: his father aggressively beats him with a belt in one difficult-to-watch scene; his mother insists she isn’t racist, but tells Paul to make sure he locks up the house because she heard “a Black boy” was seen in the alley nearby. Gray appears entirely honest in the writing of this screenplay, crafting characters that can be biased or cruel at times or lighthearted and affectionate at others. The extended family often gathers around the table for meals, getting in arguments, telling stories, and talking over one another. With his portrayal of the Graffs, Gray shows the many layers that make up a family — the tenderness and tension coexisting together.
“Armageddon Time” is often quite a bleak depiction of inequalities in America, and it doesn’t necessarily offer any answers to these persistent issues. The neutral and earth tones of the color palette reflect the muted melancholy that persists throughout the film. However, there are still moments of levity as the charming and dreamy-eyed Paul learns about the realities of the world. Ultimately, “Armageddon Time” shines a light on a specific time period with a startlingly candid eye, portraying the intimacies of family life with touching authenticity.

Midway through “God’s Creatures,” the powerful second feature from filmmaking duo Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer, workers at a seafood processing plant in coastal Ireland go through the gorey motions of gutting fish, eventually dumping a vat of bloody, flesh-filled water into a waste container. As a wave of red sludge fills the screen, the sight recalls a similarly queasy blood-drainage scene in “Leviathan,” the visceral 2012 documentary that showed viewers the grueling grind of work on a giant fishing ship. In “God’s Creatures,” Davis and Holmer take the opposite approach, keeping the scope of the story small, but they achieve an equally precise and engrossing portrait of place. The film shines and sears beyond its scale, offering an immersive portrait of a unique community and a sweeping parable of trust, complicity and confrontation.
“God’s Creatures” does not begin as the tense psychological drama it grows into: it opens on the seaside village where Aileen (Emily Watson, in a masterful performance) lives with her family and scrapes by working at the aforementioned plant. When her jovial son Brian (Paul Mescal) returns home unannounced after spending several years off the grid in Australia, she’s delighted — and she supports Brian’s efforts to make a living with illegal fishing and oyster farming. As the film progresses, the area’s weather and legal scrutiny intensify and Brian’s disregard for both grows; a creeping sense of dread radiates from the screen even as the stakes remain abstract. They soon come into focus, though, when Aileen’s coworker Emma (Isabelle Connelly) accuses Brian of sexually assaulting her and Brian calls on Aileen to give him an alibi. Caught between protecting the son she wants to believe and telling the truth about his whereabouts, she must make a choice that will have ripple effects throughout her home and her community.
Though many of “God’s Creature”’s promotional materials sparsely describe it as a film about a woman lying for her son, the specific nature of the lie — shielding her son from another woman’s allegations of sexual violence — give the film a biting urgency, harnessing its intimate character portrait to speak to broader questions of loyalty, privilege, and the impact of collective complicity. Brian’s golden-boy image haunts the film, from the public scenes of the community closing ranks to protect him to the quiet moments when his facade fades. The movie asks whether his mother, who initially declares that her son “never put a hand on a woman in his life,” can be certain of his innocence based on his rose-tinted image. How can family and friends make sense of someone’s alleged violence when it goes against the person they know?
As the film illustrates, avoidance and denial aren’t answers, and they don’t absolve anyone of guilt. By delving directly into this subject and showing what real solidarity demands, the film sends a incisive feminist message that feels particularly salient after #MeToo and other accountability movements have provoked public defenses of alleged perpetrators from those who don’t believe their loved ones are capable of misconduct — even here on Harvard’s campus. More broadly, the film details the cyclical nature of patriarchy in Aileen’s town, showing how each person’s resigned complicity keeps them all trapped with the same corrosive power dynamics.
As this central narrative unfolds, “God’s Creatures” is grounded in its striking visuals, which show Aileen’s work at the plant and Brian’s illegal fishing operation in unflinching detail. The film constructs a vision of the Irish coast that is at once beautiful and perilous. Davis and Holmer captivate with their portrayal of the often hostile natural world, which appears so forceful it becomes a character in itself. Sunlit shots of Brian tending his oyster farms and Aileen rushing past cliffs to see a corpse brought off the water are starkly gorgeous and atmospheric.
Producer Fodhla Cronin O’Reilly and writer Shane Crowley based the story off of the town in Ireland where O’Reilly was raised, and the skillful cinematography (all on 35mm film) its settings are conjured with such detail that they feel familiar. The actors’ technical preparations lend additional realism to their interactions with the harsh landscape; as they told audiences during a Q&A in Cannes, Watson practiced gutting fish to prepare for her role in the seafood plant and Mescal spent time in Ireland learning tricks of the trade from fishermen.
Beyond bringing layers of lush scenery and a visual texture to the film, the natural world also acts as a litmus test of its characters’ instincts, and their reactions to environmental threats speak to their core traits. From the village’s tradition of mothers refusing to teach their kids to swim (because they don’t want them jumping in to save someone, only to drown themselves) to Brian’s self-assured disregard for tidal hazards, the filmmakers deftly weave together storyline and setting, building up the opposing forces of communal passivity and male entitlement that shape the plot. A triumph of sharp visual style and resonant writing, “God’s Creatures” shows that Davis and Holmer are a co-directing pair to look out for.
