After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To our readers:
We write to address a letter by Government Professor Dustin Tingely regarding the factual accuracy of faculty survey results reported in a May 1 Crimson article.  We appreciate Prof. Tingely raising concerns that reporting the raw data without disclaiming a response bias leads to a perception that “all of the claims in the article could be flipped.”
The Crimson has updated the May 1 article to include a methodology section clarifying response validation and our understanding of the collected data.   Broadly, respondent demographics tracked well with publicly available information on the demographics of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Applying demographic re-weightings results in changes to the response category distributions by no greater than plus or minus 2.5 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the many experiences Harvard students have during their time here, living in the upperclassmen houses is a unifying one: It inspires camaraderie, community, and even some friendly competition. But amid the buzz of conversation around our dorms, not many pass thought to another house. It sits tucked into the quiet edges of the Yard and invariably offers a different kind of home—one open to anyone regardless of class year or House affiliation.
The Phillips Brooks House Association, a student-run nonprofit founded in 1904, manifests itself as an organization fueled by students’ creative energy and idealism. With a unique dual mission of student development and serving community needs, more than 70 PBHA programs collectively reach nearly 6,000 constituents in Cambridge and Greater Boston in the areas of youth development, housing and homelessness, adult services, immigrant services, advocacy, and out-of-school time programming.
Yet, in spite of this meaningful work, which occurs both through PBHA and many other outlets at Harvard, the value of public service often remains an afterthought here. Situated in a milieu where finance, consulting, and technology careers are the norm, public service’s dearth of monetary incentives on campus exacerbates its perception as a risky career path. Some have even questioned the purpose of service at an institution like Harvard, where it seems like capitalizing on the ostensibly stuffed wallets of students and graduates is the more effective option.
To the contrary, public service offers crucial experiences for students and an enduring impact on our constituents. In particular, PBHA is a rare opportunity for meaningful community engagement, student development, and social justice.
PBHA has been a space for generations of students to develop and go on to impact thousands of others. Its programs are mutually beneficial endeavors that monetary donations could never replace. Our alumni become lawyers, teachers, doctors, consultants—the point is, wherever its participants may end up, PBHA provides a foundation for mission-driven, community-centered work that has inspired leaders with grounded sensibilities and real, human values.
PBHA has still made a tremendous impact on public service: National organizations like Strong, Women Strong Girls and Alzheimer’s Buddies originate from PBHA roots, and others have leveraged their PBHA experiences to create their own nonprofits like the American Civil Liberties Union, which was founded by Roger N. Baldwin, Class of 1905. Providing a unique space for student development through reflection, trainings, and the support of an incredible full-time staff, PBHA’s nonprofit model offers an unprecedented amount of student leadership not found anywhere else in the nation. Rather than its full-time staff, student officers are intentionally placed as the chairs of the programming, communication, and resource committees, and the organization’s governing body, cabinet, is composed solely of students. This structure guarantees that students are the ones making decisions and leading conversation around PBHA’s vision.
As co-director of PBHA’s Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment Afterschool Program, which serves low-income and immigrant youth in Dorchester, I have had the privilege of building relationships with my students in an affirming and safe environment. I recall just last week when I asked one of our students if he would be returning to our summer program counterpart. He rolled his eyes. Of course he would (duh, Mr. Jang). Didn’t I know how much he loves the program? Truly, no amount of data can quantify the relationships formed through PBHA programs. No numbers can adequately reflect these relationships, vibrantly woven into over 114 years of service and advocacy, the kinds of emotions and the humanity that make what we do so important.
But, if you really want—we do have the numbers. Our rigorous assessment of all involved stakeholders  makes sure we can quantitatively support what we claim to say we’re doing and improve in areas we’re lacking in. PBHA employs nationally recognized surveys to assess constituents and an annual student experience survey to collect data on volunteers. In fact, our summer programming quality and outcomes are comparable to professionally-run summer programs in Boston, and an officer position dedicated solely to the evaluation and assessment of programs reflects the data-driven culture within PBHA.
PBHA’s intentional programming in addressing community needs serves as a paradigm for what meaningful partnership looks like, rather than the kind of bandage service which can harm communities. Most recently, we partnered with the Union of Minority Neighborhoods to bring community leaders onto campus to promote dialogue and action around poverty legislation. Last year during the Harvard University Dining Services strike, PBHA’s Student Labor Action Movement coordinated student support for dining hall workers with Boston’s Local 26. More than a decade before, SLAM’s predecessors led organizing efforts advocating for the livable wage of Harvard workers.
To that end, our student volunteers do public service, but we also take it a step further. We acknowledge the inextricable ties between service and tackling oppressive systems, critically examine issues affecting our constituents, and ultimately envision an equitable world where our services won’t be needed. Even more, the recent $12.1 million donation by Priscilla Chan ’07, a former PBHA director, promises to be an exciting harbinger of change to Harvard’s public service landscape by eliminating financial barriers and increasing funding sources. Initiatives have already begun to reimagine Harvard’s landscape of public service into a more transparent and accessible field.
I’m convinced monetary donations do not provide the opportunities of mutual growth and self-reflection that service is often contingent upon. And at its very essence, public service celebrates the very best of humanity: people selflessly committing to making the world a more equitable place. I sincerely wish everyone could sit in on the countless PBHA meetings I’ve attended, visit program to meet our kids, or talk with the volunteers, directors, and officers that make PBHA the organization that it is. And ultimately to experience what service, when done right, can be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This spring, I’ve been pleasantly surprised to see a lot of Asian-centered entertainment projects. By “a lot,” I mean two upcoming movies—the Pixar short “Bao” and the romantic comedy “Crazy Rich Asians.” These movies’ trailers have been exciting for me to watch and to discuss with friends.
As the saying goes, “Representation matters.” Representation in this context means seeing someone on the screen who looks like you. It can provide validation—seeing little recognizable details from your life tells you that other people have made the same observations, that those details are worthy of being told in a story. Representation can also expand the imagination—you may not know you can be something until you see someone just like you doing it, even if in a work of fiction.
Like its close cousin “diversity,” however, “representation” is no magic word—just a buzzword. More of it is better, but it should not be the main focus of a work of entertainment. Prematurely judging that work in terms of its representation only leads to dissatisfaction, and in the end, such a metric says little about the work’s long-term reception.
Nobody can be represented perfectly, as the criticism surrounding “Crazy Rich Asians” illustrates. Before filming even started, people criticized the casting of a half-Asian man as the film’s romantic lead; within hours of the trailer’s release, others criticized the lack of dark-skinned Asians. I think these people are working themselves up, months before the final product will be released for judgment, because they are too concerned about Asian representation.
Their concern indicates how incoherent the concept of “Asian representation” is. Asia is a continent with 48 countries and countless ethnic groups. So how could any actor, storyline, or movie represent Asia? Is casting token actors from multiple ethnicities really better than casting actors from mainly one? I don’t think there’s a right answer; I think the question is irrelevant and unfair.
Because regardless of what one claims is or is not representation for oneself, the mere presence of representation in a work of art should not be its selling point—and really cannot be, in the long run.
I see this in my own reaction to the Chinese-American family sitcom “Fresh off the Boat.” I dutifully started the show from its premiere, and I appreciated the observations—perhaps stereotypes—that rang true for me, like taking shoes off in the house or cutting coupons obsessively. But before long, I found other things to do on Tuesday nights, because I just didn’t find the show funny. Representation piqued my interest but did not keep me around.
Meanwhile, some of my favorite shows do not fare well in terms of representation. In “Doctor Who,” a drama about a time-traveling alien, I cannot remember a single East Asian character, despite the hundreds of planets that said alien visits. In the pirate drama “Black Sails,” I do remember the one Asian pirate, but despite appearing in most episodes, Joji never spoke a single line of dialogue and I didn’t realize he had a name until I halfheartedly Googled “Black Sails Asian pirate.”
In the end, representation says very little about whether I will end up recommending a work of entertainment to everyone in two years or whether I will watch it over and over on a night in. And that’s just fine with me. Good entertainment is good entertainment. Good entertainment does not allow me the brain space to worry about its level of representation.
In fact, I have never really devoted brain space to thinking about representation before the last few years. Maybe that is sad—it means that from a young age, I resigned myself to knowing that I would not see characters who looked like me on the big screen. But I don’t think that resignation messed me up too badly. I was looking for characters that I connected with and stories that stayed with me days after finishing. That search is how I’ve ended up identifying with and singing the praises of, for example, the time-traveling alien in “Doctor Who” and Captain Flint in “Black Sails.”
But in retrospect, I did not think about representation because I did not have trouble finding a version of it. I do see people who are like me onscreen, just not physically. Physical representation will always have its perks. I enjoyed the initial rush of excitement from “Bao” and “Crazy Rich Asians” because I consider them good physical representation. But I hope that my excitement remains long after for other reasons—for representation that is more than skin deep, for the kind of representation that has always been available.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a bizarre series of incidents, a group calling itself the “Iran Cyber Security Group” hacked the Undergraduate Council’s website on April 27 and displayed several aggressive messages, such as text reading “DOWN WITH THE USA,” as well as a cartoon of President Donald Trump being punched in the chin by a faceless individual wearing a wristband striped with the colors of the Iranian flag. A few days later, on May 1, it came to light that any student with a valid College email could log into the online spreadsheet that documents UC voting records and alter the results. Following these revelations, the UC’s cybersecurity protocols unsurprisingly have come under question.
The Council’s consistent technological problems are disappointing. The hacking by the so-called “Iran Cyber Security Group” serves as a reminder that the Council’s website may be a target of outside hackers, and their ability to easily infiltrate the UC’s cyber protections puts private information at risk. Regardless of the true identity of these hackers, this event underscores that the Harvard name and the leadership role the Council holds make the UC a particularly appealing target to those who would cause mischief or havoc. The Internet is open to all, and weak security puts the UC’s informational records at the mercy of infinite potential hackers, with serious implications for the jeopardization of student privacy.
This is especially true in light of the UC’s recent move to subsidize storage for low-income students. To accomplish this goal, the UC requested personal financial information from students which, as we have already opined, is fraught with risk. If the UC’s cyber security is not up to par, confidential student information could be endangered. In the future, the UC ought to reconsider whether it is capable of protecting personal data prior to asking students for it, and refrain from collecting confidential student information as much as possible to prevent these risks. If they see it necessary to pursue this information, they must ensure beyond doubt that it remains private and protected.
The issues with the Council’s web presence do not stop here. The editable nature of the voting records demonstrates not only the UC’s lack of online security, but also the confusing layout of its website. The voting records were editable by all College students for months, but no unauthorized edits seem to have been made and no UC members appear to have been aware of this malfunction. In short, while voting records may be open and accessible to all, no one seems to be much aware of them.
While it is good that the records appear to have not been tampered with, this indicates a larger issue in how the UC conveys information to the public. These records may have been so poorly publicized and accessible on the UC website that students did not know how to find them, let alone realize they were not secure. We believe the UC should not only be transparent with their actions, but also work to disseminate information regarding those actions. To do so, they need a website that is not only available to all students, but also easily navigated, cleanly presented, and well-organized.
We hope that the UC will address these worries when creating their new website. Any technological advancement made by the UC should prioritize the protection of student and financial information, and take user-friendliness seriously. We hope that the new format ensures that all information is coherently presented, as it presents an opportunity to learn from these mistakes and further the UC’s ability to serve the College student body.

              For much of the night April 13, the student was standing—naked and likely under the influence of narcotics—on the corner of Massachusetts Ave. and Waterhouse St., feet from the Law School’s Pound Hall, the location of Harvard University Health Services Urgent Care during non-business hours.
            

              Harvard College has an “Amnesty Policy” outlined in the student handbook that states that, if a student seeks medical help for an intoxicated friend, neither the student nor the friend will “face disciplinary action from the College.”
            

              “Any student may bring an intoxicated or drug-impaired friend to Harvard University Health Services or to a hospital, or seek assistance from College residential life staff or HUPD, and by doing this, neither they nor the friend will face disciplinary action from the College for having used or provided alcohol or drugs,” the handbook reads.
            

              HUHS’s standard protocol is to contact the Harvard University Police Department for “any emergency concern related to a Harvard student,” according to an emailed statement from HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry.
            

              Perry wrote that, after the arrest, HUHS conducted a review of its employees’ conduct April 13 and found they had followed its protocol.
            

              “We have confirmed that HUHS’s standard protocol was followed,” Perry wrote.
            

              The area where the student was standing—the corner of Massachusetts Ave. and Waterhouse St.—is not part of Harvard’s campus, so HUPD did not have jurisdiction over the case. Instead, the Cambridge Police Department had jurisdiction and consequently responded to the call.
            

              “The Cambridge Police Department has jurisdiction over the entire City of Cambridge, including schools, campuses, businesses and state roadways,” CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an emailed statement. “The University Police Departments generally patrol only the streets within their campuses.”
            

              In a later tweet, the Cambridge Police Department wrote “it was learned from [the student’s] acquaintances that he previously took narcotics, which could have a hallucinogenic effect when ingested.”
            

              The night coincided with Yardfest, the College’s annual outdoor concert.
            

              A video published online by the Cambridge Police Department shows the student standing on the median surrounded by four police officers, who talk to him for at least two minutes. The student then takes two steps towards one of the officers before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level.
            

              A later CPD police report states the student clenched his fists and “started to take steps towards officers in an aggressive manner.” One officer standing behind the undergraduate then tackled him to the ground.
            

              A statement from members of BLSA—some of witnessed the incident in person—disputes the police report and states the officer tackled the student “without provocation.”
            

              While the police officers spoke with the student, a crowd gathered to watch the confrontation, according to video footage and the police report.
            

              A witness of the arrest whom The Crimson granted anonymity due to legal concerns said he watched the incident for about five minutes while standing in a crowd of other people on the side of Mass Ave. He said there were at least 30 eyewitnesses on his side of the street. The witness also said many people in the crowd were videotaping the incident, and that one police officer worked to prevent individuals in the crowd from stepping into the street and approaching the student.
            

              HUHS does not operate an ambulance service. In the days following the student’s arrest, a new undergraduate advocacy group—Black Students Organizing for Change—has demanded that Harvard purchase its own ambulance.
            

              HUHS and the student-led EMT group, Crimson EMS, have had several conversations with the City of Cambridge regarding the feasibility of operating an ambulance, according to Perry. But city officials ultimately deemed Pro Ambulance, a local ambulance service, the “most appropriate service readily available to the Harvard community,” Perry added.
            

              A video later published by CPD shows four police officers struggling to pin the student to the ground after the first officer tackled him from behind.
            

              While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an “ineffective” attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report.
            

              While the student was on the ground, CPD officers cuffed both his wrists and his ankles before loading him into the ambulance, according to the police report.
            

              The witness who spoke to The Crimson said he saw lots of “struggling.”
            

              “I don’t know if they had handcuffs on him yet, but it just looked like there was a lot of motion,” the witness said.
            

              The arrested student was later charged with assault and resisting arrest.
            

              HUPD dispatched one officer to the scene, according to an emailed statement from HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
            

              Members of BSOC later stated HUPD was “stretched thin” during Yardfest, with only eight officers on duty and five available for patrol.
            

              Catalano confirmed that 5 officers were on patrol and that additional officers were monitoring Yardfest—the College’s annual outdoor concert—but wrote, “It is the policy of the HUPD not to get into specific staffing levels.”
            

              “The dramatic increase of alcohol-related incidents (medical transports and an assault and battery on EMTs) tied up multiple officers at various times,” he wrote.
            

              The HUPD officer who arrived never saw the arrested student because he was already in the ambulance, according to a statement from Catalano.
            

              The student spat a mixture of “saliva and blood” at an ambulance personnel, according to the CPD police report. The student was charged with assault and battery of an ambulance EMT.
            

              HUHS policy, as outlined in the student handbook, states that an undergraduate’s resident dean will be notified if a student is transferred to a local emergency department.
            

              “It is HUHS’ policy to notify the College of student transfers to local emergency departments. Such notification is provided to the appropriate Resident Dean, and is documented at HUHS in the Transfer Tracking Log,” the handbook reads.
            

              Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said later on Monday that the student underwent evaluation for issues including mental health concerns, which was “one of the reasons” the student has yet to be arraigned.
            

              Warnick wrote in a statement that the CPD officers who forcibly arrested the student that night “have yet to participate” in optional crisis intervention training meant to instruct officers how to manage situations involving mentally ill individuals.
            

              The Harvard Black Law Students Association tweeted the night of the student’s arrest that the arrest was an instance of police brutality. The next day, BLSA held a meeting to update students and to provide people a platform to process the arrest. Immediately before the meeting, BLSA posted a press release on its site reiterating its belief that the incident is a “symptom of a larger, systemic problem” of police violence against black and brown people.
            

              The statement also disputes CPD’s account of the arrest and lists several demands for CPD and Harvard institutions including HUHS and HUPD. The statement has since garnered support from a number of organizations, internal and external to Harvard.
            

              Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern posted a statement on Twitter calling a video of the arrest “disturbing” and stating he had been following the arrest and its aftermath closely. McGovern wrote that he and other city officials were in communication with CPD officials and local activists and were working assess the situation.
            

              McGovern added that Cambridge “affirms that Black Lives Matter” and that he would work with other officials to ensure that the incident is “properly investigated” and that the public would be informed of any new developments.
            

              “As Mayor, I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure that the horrific treatment of black Americans at the hands of law enforcement has no place in Cambridge," he wrote.
            

              CPD policy mandates that the department must conduct an internal review any time a police officer uses force. Bard said the results of the review will be made public.
            

              “Whenever a police officer exercises any degree of force in the execution of his or her duties, the burden is on the police department to prove that such force was used in the accordance with department policy and established state and federal law,” the policy reads. “Because the police department carries an affirmative burden to demonstrate that the exercise of force was necessary and appropriate, the department must conduct a complete and thorough review of all such incidents.”
            

              Bard said he “absolutely” supports the officers who arrested the student. He added, though, that he will not make final determinations before “completing a complete and thorough investigation.”
            

              In her email to University affiliates, University President Drew G. Faust wrote that Harvard had been in contact with Cambridge city officials regarding the incident and that the University would continue to work with officials to address concerns about CPD. Though Faust did not explicitly mention whether Harvard would conduct an internal review of HUHS, HUPD, or other campus institutions, she did write that the University's work "will and must include hearing directly from students, faculty, and staff about their experiences, concerns, and ideas."
            

              The incident “raises important issues about the relationship between police and the communities they serve, student health resources, and the manner in which University units operate with each other and with our partners in the community,” Faust wrote.
            

              Professors Sullivan and Umunna, director and deputy director of the HLS Criminal Justice Institute respectively, released a statement announcing they would be acting as the student's attorneys.
            

              The professors wrote that their focus is on the student's "health and well-being" and that they would not provide further comment until they deem it "necessary."
            

              Sullivan previously represented the family of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who was shot and killed by police officers in Ferguson, MO in 2014. Brown's death was one of several instances of police violence against black men that sparked the Black Lives Matter movement.
            

              Immediately after news of the arrest broke, students at the College started organizing. A group of undergraduates created a coalition—BSOC—whose mission is “hold Harvard University accountable for the safety of community members, particularly Black and Brown students.” The students released a statement outlining 10 demands for the University, HUHS, and HUPD and asked that the institutions respond by May 1.
            

              BSOC also held a silent protest on Saturday during Visitas weekend to demand reform to the University processes they say led to the arrest. Over 200 Harvard affiliates participated in the protest.
            

              City Manager Louis DePasquale submitted the budget proposal at a City Council meeting; included in the proposal is a new office that will “proactively” monitor incidents of racially biased policing and use of force within CPD. The office did not come specifically in response to the arrest of the student, but had been in the works since August 2017.
            

              “Believed to be the first of its kind in the nation, the Office of Procedural Justice will focus on proactively monitoring data related to police-citizen interactions for indications of possible racial profiling, racially-biased policing, or use of force incidents,” the proposal reads.
            

              The committee will also undertake a “systematic examination” of a wide variety of Harvard policies. Harvard Law School and History professor Annette Gordon-Reed will chair the committee.
            

              “This work must start with a focus on how the changing nature of our student body should influence the ways in which we address issues of College policy, mental health resources, and community policing," Faust wrote to students.
            

              Faust said she has asked the committee to complete its work over the summer and make findings and initial recommendations for action before the start of the fall 2018 semester.
            

              The announcement of the committee met BSOC’s May 1 deadline—but Faust later said the committee did not come as a direct response to student demands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School is hosting a series of diversity-focused dialogues this year to address racial inclusion at the school and the racial makeup of its students and faculty.
The recently released final report of the University-wide Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging revealed that the Medical School has the lowest percentage of underrepresented minority faculty across all of Harvard’s schools.
Multiple school administrators, including Dean of the Medical School George Q. Daley ’82 and Dean for Diversity and Community Partnership Joan Y. Reede, have attended the dialogues alongside faculty, students, and staff.
The first dialogue, held earlier this year in the Waterhouse Room in Gordon Hall, focused on public images and art at the school.
“You walk down the halls of Harvard Medical School, and all of the portraiture is 1700s and 1800s white guys,” Daley said. “There in the Waterhouse Room, we've got this series of portraits from our founders and from past deans, and then we have a few photographs of women faculty, prominent women faculty, photographs of prominent African-American faculty.”
Reede said students shared a range of experiences with public images at the event. Some students “very much feel left out,” while others do not notice the lack of women or people of color in public art, according to Reede.
“It runs the full gamut,” she said.
Public art and imagery have come up in other diversity-related discussions at the Medical School and the University.
A subcommittee of the Dean’s Diversity Task Force, established last year, will be looking into campus representations of prominent alumni and former faculty and giving recommendations to Daley about the matter.
Advocacy group White Coats for Black Lives,which gave Harvard Medical School a B- on racial justice last week, wrote in its report card that the school’s “physical space explicitly celebrates racist/white supremacist individuals.”
“The overwhelming majority of individuals whose likenesses are present in Harvard Medical School public spaces are white men,” the group’s report stated.
Inclusive symbols and spaces are also among the goals outlined in the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging final report. The task force comprised 55 members from across the University, including HMS Professor of Clinical Medicine Katrina A. Armstrong.
The second dialogue, held last week, discussed “being other,” which Reede said is an experience “the vast majority of people” have experienced.
“The messages that came out of that I think really illuminated the nature of the kinds of values we want to aspire to at Harvard Medical School,” Daley said. “And that is a community where every individual is valued, every individual is supported and can rise to the level of their bravest aspirations.”
The next dialogue will focus on microaggressions, according to Reede.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern questioned the Cambridge Police Department’s use of force—specifically punching—during the recent arrest of a black Harvard undergraduate at an event Wednesday night.
McGovern also said he has received criticism from police officers who felt his comments on the arrest did not show support for the officers.
The Harvard College Leadership Development Initiative invited McGovern to speak at Sever Hall Wednesday about Cambridge politics and McGovern’s experience as mayor. A handful of undergraduates attended the hour-long event.
The mayor began the conversation Wednesday night by discussing Cambridge voting policies, the ongoing effort to provide more affordable housing, and his background as a lifelong Cantabrigian and a former social worker. The black student’s arrest came up after a member of the audience asked about the incident and the mayor's “gut reaction."
CPD officers arrested the student, who was standing off-campus and thus outside of the territory over which the Harvard University Police Department has jurisdiction, on April 13. The student was standing naked and likely under the influence of narcotics on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Waterhouse Street—an area only feet from the Law School, though not part of campus.
After CPD officers arrived at the scene, they spoke briefly with the student before one officer tackled the student to the ground and delivered five punches to the student’s stomach in an effort to handcuff him, according to the CPD police report.
A video of the incident later published by the Cambridge Police Department shows the student standing still, surrounded by four officers, while the officers talk to him for several seconds. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
Hours after the arrest, the Harvard Black Law Students Association released a statement calling the incident an example of “police brutality.” In the following weeks, University affiliates met to process and protest the incident, and University President Drew G. Faust recently announced she has convened a committee to review the events leading up to the arrest.
Three days after the arrest,  McGovern released a statement calling the arrest "disturbing."
“We have high standards for our police officers in Cambridge,” the statement read.
On Wednesday, McGovern spoke for roughly 10 minutes about the arrest, beginning by defending his original statement.
“I put out a statement which had people on both sides hating me, so I think it was good,” McGovern said.
He then devoted time to defending and praising the Cambridge Police Department, adding that it has been some time since a similar incident has occured in the city.
“I think we have a great police force. People have gone back 10 years to the Louis Gates situation to find an incident that they can point to of the Cambridge Police treating a person of color—or, in a city of 115,000 people, with the diversity we have, and you have to go back 10 years, that’s pretty good,” McGovern said.
Gates, a professor of African and African American studies, was arrested at his home in 2009 in an incident that sparked national dialogue and was largely criticized as racist.
McGovern also said that, even though Cambridge “do[es] a lot more training of our police officers,” there are going to be some officers who “aren’t going to follow that training.”
The mayor pointed to his background in social work and said he has had to restrain individuals himself. He said that process is “always disturbing.”
“I’ve done hundreds of restraints of teenagers, mostly, who I’ve worked with, who have been having a mental health crisis and have either determined whether they’re going to hurt themselves or hurt someone else and you have to restrain them,” McGovern said. “It is always disturbing. It is disturbing for the person who has to be restrained. It is disturbing for the people who do the restraints. It is disturbing for the people who are watching. That looked horrible.”
McGovern said at the event that, up until officers began punching the student, the restraint “wasn’t any different than any other restraint” that he has seen.
“I’ve been a certified trainer in crisis prevention, the CPI, Crisis Prevention Institute which is all about the escalation and then the second component is about to restrain people. I’ve been a certified trainer in that for 25 years and never seen a training that punching is part of the curriculum,” McGovern said.
At the event, the mayor also said members of the police department are “pissed” at him for his response to the incident.
“I just spoke at a police thing today and I was going to get booed because they’re all pissed at me,” McGovern said.
“And so for the police who were angry at me because I said we have to actually investigate this and look at this and learn from this and see what could have been done differently, they took that as ‘You’re not supporting us,’” McGovern added.  “And I said ‘No, I think what the investigation is going to show is that they did what they had to do in that situation.’ But you always want to look and you want to learn.”
McGovern said self-criticism is crucial in order for the incident to become a learning opportunity for the city and the police department.
"One of the things that we have to do as a city, as the police department and as individuals, is be willing to self-reflect and be self-critical,” McGovern said. “That’s how you grow and that’s how you get better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust penned a letter to U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06—a key proponent of legislation that could imperil Harvard's social organization sanctions—arguing against that legislation.
In the letter, Faust wrote the legislation is worrying and emphasized she believes the College's social group penalties are important and necessary to ensure undergraduates have "the experience of full citizenship" at Harvard.
"I worry [the legislation] represents an effort by Congress to regulate student life and the shape and character of private institutions in a way that threatens to undermine that diversity of choice and experience," Faust wrote.
Faust also unsuccessfully sought to meet with Stefanik on her most recent trip to Washington, she said in an interview Tuesday. Stefanik declined the meeting because of scheduling conflicts, according to her spokesperson, Tom Flanagin.
“Unfortunately Congresswoman Stefanik’s schedule was full with previously arranged committee work and constituent meetings,” Flanagin wrote in an emailed statement.
The legislation Faust pointed to in her letter comes as an amendment to  the PROSPER Act, a law that would reauthorize the Higher Education Act of 1965. The law principally deals with programs related to financial aid and higher education affordability, but a group of Republican lawmakers have moved to tack on a provision that seeks to forbid universities that have “a policy allowing for the official recognition of single-sex student organizations” from penalizing members of groups.
Harvard’s sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender social groups from holding campus leadership positions, serving as captains of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious post-graduate fellowships.
As it stands now, the amendment would not affect Harvard, which does not officially recognize single-gender social organizations. But a group of lobbyists and club affiliates are seeking to change that.
Faust condemned the amendment to the PROSPER Act in a March interview, calling the legislation “not the business of the United States Congress.” She also said she was “surprised” to learn Stefanik is involved in pushing for it.
Despite Stefanik’s heavy involvement with the amendment to the PROSPER Act, Faust said the Harvard alumna has been an ally on the Hill regarding other issues pertinent to Harvard and higher education.
“She’s been very supportive and engaged with the IOP,” Faust said. “She was great on issues about the endowment tax and some of our other concerns in the tax bill.”
Faust wrote in the letter to Stefanik that she had hoped to meet with the congresswoman in March and was sorry they were “unable to connect.”
In the letter, Faust explained the social group policy does not ban membership to unrecognized social groups on campus—instead it forbids members from enjoying what Faust called the "privileges of deans' endorsements" and "institutionally supported leadership roles." She noted that, under the policy, students can join single-gender final clubs, fraternities, or sororities and "remain in good standing."
She added that unrecognized single-gender social organizations have, in recent years, played an “outsized role” in Harvard’s social life.
“The exclusive, gender-based membership and activities of these clubs are a direct challenge to the long and historic movement to ensure that opportunities central to Harvard undergraduate life are not limited by accident of birth, but open to every student,” Faust wrote.
Faust also wrote that one of the “unique strengths” of American higher education comprises students’ ability to choose among a “broad array” of institutions, academic pursuits, and extracurricular activities.
Faust said on Tuesday the goal of her letter to Stefanik was to “explain why we’ve come to the position that we have, why it’s important to Harvard, and why it’s important to higher education.”
On her most recent trip to Washington in April, Faust did not meet with any other legislators about the amendment to the PROSPER Act. That trip was Faust’s last official trip to Washington before she steps down from the presidency in June.
“I think I’ve done my Washington lobbying. We’re done,” Faust said. “No trips planned.”
In recent weeks, a group of Harvard affiliates with very different goals also boarded a plane to Washington to undertake lobbying activities. Ten College students traveled to the capital last week to advocate in part for the PROSPER Act amendment. Graduate President of the Fly Club Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 said the students from Harvard are members of final clubs and Greek organizations on campus.
The students joined a wider effort to lobby around the PROSPER Act—that effort includes the Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee, which recently added Lars E. Peterson ’68, a graduate member of the Porcellian Club, to its board of directors. The Cambridge Coalition, a band of Harvard final clubs and Greek organizations that includes the Porcellian, is also participating in the effort.
On Tuesday, Faust reiterated her concerns about the federal government and alumni groups attempts' to intervene in University decisions on student life. Faust said this activity forms a matter of concern for “those who are running the College, in the College, on the faculty of the College.”
“That lobbyists should be raising money to influence legislations to intrude in University affairs seems to me highly inappropriate and a level of government intervention that is surprising to find supported by Republicans,” Faust said. “It seems to me at odds with the whole philosophy of the Republican party.”
Despite her concern, Faust said the University has undertaken “no targeted action” toward social groups’ lobbying efforts as of May 1. The University has not reached out to members of the Cambridge Coalition or other lobbying groups, according to Faust.
“We try to make the case through reason and through making arguments that indicate why these measures are helpful to, that we’re advocating for helpful to higher education and thus to the nation as a whole,” Faust said. “So our lobbying is different from a kind of lobbying that invests money in people’s political campaigns, or PACs, or anything of that sort.”
The PROSPER Act, which was approved by a House committee in Dec. 2017, has yet to move to a full House vote. A committee in the Senate, chaired by Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, is working on its own version, but has yet to release anything apart from its preliminary deliberations.
Faust said it is difficult to know how the PROSPER Act will fare in the House and what might happen if it goes to the Senate. She said that it will be important for the University to “keep very close watch on it” in the coming months, adding that President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow will be “very much focused” on the PROSPER Act when he takes office in July.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A company that revolutionizes ear infection treatment, an app to guide small business in emerging markets, and a toolkit to empower girls in STEM all won big Wednesday night.
PionEar, OZÉ, and STEMgem—ventures pioneered by Harvard students—received $75,000 as the winners of the 2018 iteration of the President’s Innovation Challenge.
The annual challenge, which began in 2011, aims to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. It is administered by the Harvard Innovation Labs, or i-lab, a center for creative ventures that opened the same year next to the Business School. Applicants are encouraged to “engage with pressing issues facing the world and to explore turning their ideas into impactful, real-world ventures.”
This year 123 teams representing 12 different Harvard schools competed for a share of the $310,000 in prizes. The 15 finalist teams presented their projects to visitors at the i-lab Wednesday before University President Drew G. Faust announced the award recipients.
In her remarks, Faust described the work being done at the i-lab as “daring” and “bold.”
“It audaciously says that a handful of people can make a big difference, that you don’t have to wait on the sideline for something to happen for you—you seize that opportunity yourself and with one collaborator or with a handful of collaborators or a whole team of collaborators, you can make something happen,” Faust said.
Before the ceremony, STEMgem co-founder and Harvard Kennedy School student Eva-Maria F. Olbers said she was “overwhelmed in a good way” about being a finalist.
“Honestly as an entrepreneur, it’s not always the easiest path,” she said. “There are days when it gets more difficult, there can be days when you feel unmotivated or even lonely in your journey—and the i-lab has created an amazing community around that.”
STEMgem co-founder Larissa Nietner said the i-lab was good at “celebrating the little successes” during the “up and down” process of launching a start-up.
During the awards ceremony, i-lab Executive Director Jodi Goldstein said, “I always get a little emotional on nights like this, hearing from all the teams and talking to them around the space. It’s the culmination of so much hard work, and I’m so proud of each and every one of them.”
Goldstein said the Innovation Challenge celebrates taking risks, persevering, and collaborating, which she said is becoming “increasingly essential” in modern society.
“We hope to arm the innovative minds of tomorrow with the skills and resources they need to have an impact in whatever it is they decide to do,” Goldstein said.
Some members of teams who did not win that evening said they still found the opportunity to be a valuable experience.
“The process through which we put everything we worked on for our application and prepared a pitch has really helped us reflect on how far we’ve come in just under a year and a half,” Coding it Forward co-founder Chris D. Kuang ’20 said.
“To be able to get to this point has been really rewarding for us,” he said. “There are a lot of other teams with fantastic ideas that have applied, and being selected as one of the finalists in the social and cultural impact track is already I think for us a significant win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard prepares to collectively bargain with its graduate student union, 21 students have begun campaigning to represent their peers at the bargaining table.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers is holding elections for the bargaining committee, the union’s main negotiating body, May 9 and 10.
The 21 students are competing for 13 available seats, some of which are reserved for students from specifics schools and divisions.  After the 13-person group is selected, the body will likely spend several months distributing and collecting bargaining surveys to gauge what issues are most important to the roughly 5,000 members of the union. After at least half of eligible students have completed the survey, the committee can begin drawing up a bargaining agenda which they will present to University administrators.
Three of the divisional positions are already filled because their occupants are running uncontested.
Several of the committee candidates were involved in organizing for the union in the months and years leading up to the April 2018 union election.
Union organizer and Economics Ph.D. student Justin Bloesch—who is running for the Social Science Division position—said he is “excited” to have one-on-one conversations with students about the bargaining process—a strategy that figured prominently in pre-election organizing.
Ashley B. Gripper and Keletso Makofane, two candidates for the School of Public Health, also both organized for HGSU-UAW in the run-up to the April 2018 union election, within their respective departments. Gripper said she and Makofane hope to contribute to “more diverse representation” in union leadership roles.
Though HGSU-UAW has allotted positions for various degree-granting programs, members will represent the whole bargaining unit—including the 1,523 students who voted against unionization in April’s election. Several candidates emphasized the need to bring the interests of anti-union students into consideration at all steps of the bargaining process.
“We are all a union now, and I think it is imperative that we heal the wounds of the election and move forward in a way that satisfies the needs of everyone,” Maddy F. Jennewein, who is running uncontested for one of the DMS positions.
Physics Ph.D. student Cole M. Meisenhelder wrote in an email that his academic background would differentiate him from other potential committee members.
“One thing I would bring is my experience as an experimental physicist—while I would do my best to serve the entire unit, it's also important to have a bargaining committee that represents the broad range of work experiences that grad students live,” he wrote.
At least one candidate—SEAS Ph.D. student Yuntian Deng—voted against unionization. Deng said that, after the union won, he decided it was important that people with “concerns” about the union—like some of his colleagues in the field of engineering—also engage in the process and “speak up” for their interests.
“When the union proposes a contact, I don’t want the contract to promote the interests of a certain set of students while sacrificing the interests of some other set of students,” Deng said.
Both pro- and anti-union candidates cited several common issues they aim to raise in negotiations. These included fair rates of pay, a formalized grievance process for reporting cases resolving conflicts with advisers, and protections against sexual harassment and discrimination.
Eleven of the organizing committee positions will be reserved by academic unit, broken down proportionally to the number of eligible teaching and research assistants within the school or division. The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School of Public Health, Harvard Law School, and the College are each allotted one position on the committee.
Four positions are alloted to students from GSAS, the school which comprises the largest portion of the bargaining unit. These positions are broken down further by division—the humanities and social sciences divisions will contribute one member each, while the natural sciences division will get two members.
Two members will also be elected from the Division of Medical Sciences, a division of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences that offers six interdisciplinary graduate programs including a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences.
Finally, one committee member will come from one of Harvard’s “other professional schools,” according to the union’s notice of election. These schools include the Graduate School of Design, the Kennedy School, the Divinity School, the Graduate School of Education, the Business School, and the Division of Continuing Education.
Union organizer and English Ph.D. student Andrew B. Donnelly wrote in an email that the elected members will receive training from United Automobile Workers negotiators before they begin the bargaining process. Negotiations can take more than a year, especially for the first contract between a union and an employer.
The University has yet to announce who the elected students will face during negotiations and whether outside counsel will be present.
A complete list of candidates is below:

Several Kennedy School faculty members signed a pledge calling for and supporting efforts to diversify HKS students, faculty, and staff, according to a banner currently on display at the school.
The pledge, written by Kennedy School students, calls upon faculty members to endorse “all kinds” of diversity at “all levels” of the school by supporting research about historically marginalized groups. The pledge also asks professors to commit to frequent attendance at meetings about diversity, undergo professional development focused on diversity and inclusion, and carry out regular reviews of diversity initiatives.
Shaniqua L. McClendon, a second-year Kennedy School student and an organizer of the pledge, said it is the “beginning of a conversation” with faculty about greater minority presence at the school.
“We want to frankly get them on the record as supporting or not supporting this effort so we know who we are working with, where things stand, and where the pressure points are,” McClendon said in an interview.
McClendon said faculty play a “very, very large role” at the school, so their support is important when advocating for diversity issues.
“As far as we are concerned, the faculty... dictate what HKS as an institution is because they decide who new faculty are, what faculty members become more senior or tenured, and as you become senior or tenured, those folks get to set the tone of what things are happening at the Kennedy School,” she said.
Garrett M. Neiman, another student organizer, said he is “excited” about the pledge because it asks faculty to “put a stake into their ground” and commit to promoting diversity at HKS.
“I think for those willing to sign this, we hope that that's a beginning of a coalition of faculty members who are willing to drive progress forward and for those who are not willing to sign, we want to understand why,” Neiman said.
“This is not about blaming or shaming people necessarily but really starting a dialogue,” he added.
In response to the pledge, Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an email Sunday that HKS remains committed to diversity efforts.
“The Kennedy School continues to work toward the goals of enhancing diversity, inclusion, and belonging, and we support all members of our community working together to help achieve these goal,” Gavel wrote.
As of Wednesday evening, seven faculty members signed onto the pledge, and their names were displayed on the banner hanging in a hallway near the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. These faculty members said they endorsed the pledge for a variety of reasons, but all agreed that the school's lack of diversity is a significant problem school leaders need to address.
Khalil G. Muhammad, a professor of public policy and a vocal supporter of student activism around diversity at HKS, said it seems like the faculty have a “huge role” to play in changing culture at the school.
“I've been to a dozen diversity events of one kind throughout the year and I can count the number of faculty there on one hand.” Muhammad said.
“I find that a challenge for how this work is supposed to proceed given that the faculty, as the dean tells the students a lot, have essentially the bulk of the power to shape the direction of the school,” he continued.
Nicco Mele, director of the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy, said it was a “moral imperative” for him to sign this pledge.
“I think I am a walking caricature of privileged white male, and I feel like it's a moral imperative that I do what I can to fight racism and have a really inclusive approach to the greatest research institution on earth,” Mele said.
Jeffrey L. Seglin, director of the HKS communications program, said the pledge was a statement of support for “all the efforts that HKS is already undertaking.”
“Asking us to sign a statement that supports the efforts the administration has already committed to and has engaged us in did not seem like too much to ask of faculty,” Seglin said.
McClendon wrote in an email Wednesday that only one person solicited to support the pledge declined to sign, but organizers chose not to disclose the person's identity out of concern for “their standing” at the school.
“Although the respondent admitted that there was no proof that this would have a negative or positive impact on their standing at the Kennedy School, it does showcase the perceived culture of the institution,” McClendon wrote. “I am hopeful that those responsible for creating this environment, whether perceived or real, will sign on and prove to their colleagues that diversity and inclusion are important.”
Gavel wrote that HKS “supports” and “welcomes” the views of all affiliates of the Kennedy School.
“As we prepare the campus for reunion weekend and commencement, we will continue to support the visible expression of those views in ways consistent with our preparations,” Gavel wrote.

Seventy-three undergraduates learned Thursday they had won the 2018 Thomas T. Hoopes Prize, awarded annually for outstanding scholarly work or research.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences awards Hoopes Prizes for the purpose of “recognizing, promoting, honoring, and rewarding excellence in the work of undergraduates,” according to the award’s website. While many of the winning projects were senior theses or senior projects, the award is open to any undergraduate student at the College.
Funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes, Class of 1919, the designation comes with $5,000 per awardee, along with a $2,000 honorarium for faculty nominators who oversaw student projects.
“I screamed,” English concentrator Maeva M. O’Brien ’18 said of the moment when she found out she had won. “I was very excited. I definitely was not expecting to get a Hoopes. And then my roommate was right there, so I told her, and then I started telling close friends, and I called my mom, that kind of thing.”
Many winners said they considered the thesis a joint effort that included the ongoing support they received from advisors, faculty, friends, and family.
“I’m just so grateful to my advisor Lynn, who I worked very closely with; to a number of faculty members who offered guidance; to my friends; and my family most of all, who were so supportive; to the baristas at Petsi Pies, for always refilling my coffee mug,” History and Literature concentrator Josiah B. Corbus ’18 said.
Some winners said they felt a personal connection to their projects. S. Kate Yoon ’18, a Social Studies concentrator whose project applied Kant’s political writings to contribute to the literature on multiculturalism, said both her academic and personal experiences shaped her decision to pursue this work.
“It's obviously a very specific and very theoretical topic, but I think I was influenced by personal experiences of growing up as an immigrant and a minority, and seeing how that affects political participation,” Yoon said.
Defne Altan ’18, a Neurobiology concentrator, said her project focused on biomarkers for visceral and liver fat and whether such molecules could predict cognitive impairment and dementia. Altan said she has wanted to do this type of research since coming to college. 
“In freshman year, I approached the neurobiology advisor, Dr. Magnotti, and I said, ‘I have a research project that is all about obesity, but I want to do the neurobiology concentration. What am I going to do?’ And she said, ‘It has to be about neurons somehow.’ And this is the result,” Altan said.
Altan said she knew her project was ambitious—and even a bit risky—but she also said she believes the risks she took were ultimately important to her winning the prize.
“The nature of the thesis and the awards that come out of the thesis—I feel that it rewards intellectual risk-taking, particularly because you get the opportunity to mesh subjects that are completely opposite and different from each other,” she said.
Many winners said they reacted to the prize with disbelief and gratitude. But Corbus also said he believes the Hoopes Prize should not be taken as the only—or even the primary—measure of successful theses.
“There are so many people who work so hard and pour so much of themselves into their theses, and produce really tremendous work, and don't get recognized,” Corbus said. “Their work is beyond valuable even if it doesn’t get official recognition. I found myself thinking a lot about that and those people today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Labor experts and union organizers say Harvard’s recent move to bargain with its graduate student union may boost efforts by student assistant unions at peer universities to bring their administrators to the negotiating table.
Despite a 2016 National Labor Relations Board ruling establishing teaching and research assistants as unionizable employees, graduate student unionization efforts at several private universities around the country remain stalled. On these campuses, university administrators have either declined to bargain with elected unions or objected to both proposed and actual student union elections.
Harvard’s move on Tuesday to bargain with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers marks a departure from that trend. Only one other private university—New York University—has voluntarily recognized a union of student assistants.
Labor experts widely expect that the current Republican-led NLRB will reverse the 2016 precedent that allows student assistants to unionize if it hears a viable case on the matter. Several universities opposed to student unionization—including Columbia, Yale, and the University of Chicago—appear to be acting on this assumption, bringing challenges to the precedent before the Board and federal courts.
Students and union organizers have responded with protests. The graduate student union at Columbia—which students voted to approve in Dec. 2016—concluded a week-long strike on Monday in an unsuccessful attempt to push administrators to recognize the union. At the strike’s conclusion, Columbia organizers expressed their intention to strike again next year. Members of Boston College’s graduate student union have similarly organized public demonstrations in recent weeks protesting the university’s refusal to bargain with the union.
At the University of Chicago, where graduate students voted to unionize in Oct. 2017, university administrators objected to election results before the National Labor Relations Board, asking the agency to override its previous opinions on the right of graduate students to unionize.
In an effort to preclude the NLRB from hearing a case on graduate student unionization, the parent organizations of several graduate student unions—including the union at UChicago—withdrew their representation petitions in early 2018, putting a hold on further legal action.
Olga Brudastova, a Columbia organizer, wrote in an email that the Harvard decision adds “momentum” to the unionization movement.
“We are excited to see Harvard respecting the democratic decision of its graduate workers and their commitment to bargain with HGSU,” she wrote. “Columbia should follow them, as well as several other private universities, like NYU and the New School, and start bargaining with us.”
UChicago organizer Katie Nolan said she thinks Harvard’s decision to bargain undermines arguments made by universities who have declined to negotiate with graduate students.
“Oftentime they’ll say things like, ‘private institutions have never unionized—we’re very different from public institutions like University of Michigan and like Berkeley and therefore this is completely untested’,” Nolan said. “I’d say that Harvard agreeing to bargain is going to fly in the face of the rhetoric our university is using to explain why they’re not following the law.”
University of Oregon professor Gordon Lafer wrote in an email that Harvard’s move to bargain may encourage other universities to follow suit.
“If Harvard is truly committed to bargaining in good faith—which will become clear one way or another once negotiations start—that would put some pressure on the other universities to also follow the law,” Lafer wrote. “It will embolden those among alumni, faculty, donors, grad students and undergrads who are calling on those administrators to bargain in good faith. But legally it doesn't change the situation for any other employer.”
Former NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV said that, while other universities may not follow Harvard’s lead, the decision to bargain could serve as a model for future discussions on graduate student unionization.
“I think that the major impact of this is going to be to provide an example of how collective bargaining possibly can work effectively,” Gould said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Labor experts say the boundaries delineating issues allowed on the bargaining table for Harvard’s newly formed graduate student union could differ significantly from those that define a typical labor contract negotiation.
In Tuesday announcements that Harvard plans to bargain with its new union, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and University President Drew G. Faust both noted University administrators plan to enforce a distinction between academic and labor issues when negotiating with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.
“We will be very adamant about differentiating between matters that are appropriate for academic decision making from matters that are concerns of a labor or employment situation,” Faust said in an interview Tuesday morning.
In an email to Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates the same afternoon, Garber wrote he believes “the relationship between students and a university is, above all else, an academic one.”
According to University of Michigan law professor Kate E. Andrias, the National Labor Relations Act makes a distinction between issues employers must bargain over and issues that they can choose to include in a contract.
“Section 8(d) of the statute requires good faith bargaining with respect to ‘terms and conditions of employment,” she wrote. “Issues that are not ‘terms and conditions of employment’ are permissive bargaining subjects.  What that means is: Harvard would not commit an unfair labor practice if it refuses to discuss permissive subjects or if makes changes regarding those subjects without negotiating with the workers.”
Andrias wrote that topics usually considered mandatory include wages, overtime, grievance procedures, arbitration, safety and health, changes in work assignments, and non-discrimination policies.  But she said the University could propose to maintain control over some or all of these issues by including a "management rights" clause in their contract with Harvard Graduate Students-United Automobile Workers—a provision asserting the power of the employer to oversee all matters not included in the contract.
In an email, University of Oregon professor Gordon Lafer, who formerly served as a senior labor policy advisor for the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor, wrote he thinks the University’s commitment to draw a firm line between academic and labor issues may be unusual.
“There is not a single case of an academic union insisting on bargaining over grades, letters of recommendation, awarding of honors, tenure criteria, what fields of specialization a department should concentrate in, admission criteria, or any other academic judgment,” Lafer wrote.
This commitment could be considered “suspicious” if administrators were to expand the scope of what they consider to be academic judgments, according to Lafer.
“This starts, after all, with administrators' suggestion that all the work of grad students— teaching, grading, giving lectures, running discussion sections, advising, running labs, etc.—is really part of their own education,” Lafer wrote. “If they really believe that, then they'll say that all of that entails academic judgment that can't possibly be a subject for mutual negotiation.”
Former National Labor Relations Board Chairman William B. Gould IV said the commitment to keep academic issues off the table is impossible to interpret prematurely.
“The demarcation lines, if they choose to draw them, would probably focus on these kinds of considerations: the way in which examinations are graded; lecturing, the duties and obligations of lecturers; and the ability in the case of research assistants for faculty to unilaterally determine their mission and the instructions that are associated with it,” Gould said.
“But I don’t know what the issues are and which might arise,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Greeted by fanfare and unseasonably warm temperatures, more than a hundred naked undergraduates celebrated their last night of freedom before final exams by running a lap or two around the Yard at midnight Thursday as part of a semesterly tradition known as Primal Scream.
Crowds of students walking from both freshmen dorms and upperclassmen houses gathered at an unofficial starting line in front of Hollis Hall shortly before midnight. Dancing, shouting, and cheering on friends, students stripped off their robes and undergarments before sprinting the lap around Harvard Yard.
The Harvard University Band—many of whom were also scantily clothed—began performing in front of the John Harvard statue just before midnight. Tourists and other students also gathered near the edge of the Yard to take pictures of the band and of the growing crowd of nude students.
Maya H. Levine ’21 said in an interview before the scream that she believes the tradition is “hilarious,” but she did not want to participate if only a few people ran.
“I’m definitely not going to run alone,” Levine said. “So I’m planning on running if I’m not the only one.”
After the run, students said they enjoyed the chance to have fun before finals began.
Nikole L. Naloy ’21 said the run was “the most liberating experience.” She said she participated because she wanted to “build community” with her fellow classmates.
Andrew D.  Zuckerman ’21, said he had no qualms about streaking through the Yard.
“I was taking a shower last night and I was naked there and I was like, ‘If I’m naked in the shower I can be naked in the Yard,’” Zuckerman said. “It’s the same thing.”
Other students who had partaken in Primal Scream before said they were thrilled by the chance to relive their exciting experiences.
Isabel A. Wagner ’18, a former Crimson blog chair, said she ran with the same friend she ran with in her freshman fall for its “sentimental value.”
“We both ran it freshman fall, and we wanted to do it senior spring to kind of do full circle,” Wagner said.
Harry T. Newman-Plotnik ’18, who ran last year, said the experience was worth repeating.
“Why not? I suppose,” Newman-Plotnik said. “There’s not a lot of institutionally sanctioned time to just run naked.”
“It’s weird and it’s oddly exhilarating and longer than you think it is,” Newman-Plotnik added.
In the days leading up the event and in the hours following, several College students and alumni questioned the practice. Though Primal Scream is a long-running tradition which University administrators and police do not prohibit, some students said they are concerned the event is occurring so soon after the arrest of a naked, black College student last month.
Reina A. E. Gattuso ’15, a former Crimson editorial editor, wrote an article for Feministing.com last week arguing that the difference in perception between Primal Scream and last month’s incident is reflective of a racial “hierarchy of bodies," in which she says drug and nudity offenses receive starkly different responses on the part of the police depending on the race of the perpetrator.
She referenced her own undergraduate experience, writing, “When I stood in Harvard Square naked and intoxicated, a white woman participating in the esteemed College’s Primal Scream ritual, I was not beaten when down.”
She further contrasted this week’s relatively tame Primal Scream with the one that took place in Dec. 2014, when students attempted to hold a silent demonstration over the killings of two unarmed black men, Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner of New York, killed in the summer of 2014.
Though similar protests did not occur at this year’s Primal Scream, a couple dozen people shared Gattuso’s article on Twitter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard employee Eric Clopper planned and filmed promotional videos for a controversial one-man performance—in which he called Judaism an “unmasked genital mutilation cult” and stripped naked—in his workplace and during work hours.
Clopper, a systems administrator at the Language Resource Center located in Lamont Library, fervently criticized the traditional Jewish practice of circumcision and performed sexual acts while fully naked with an inflatable sex doll as part of a  performance he gave Tuesday in Sanders Theatre. Spokesperson Rachael Dane later announced Wednesday the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is “reviewing” the nudity and "anti-Semitic content" included in the show, titled "Sex & Circumcision: An American Love Story."
Dane wrote that Clopper's nudity seems to violate the terms of the entertainment license Harvard holds with the City of Cambridge for Sanders Theater; she noted "we are currently engaged in a review" to determine whether Clopper provided the University with an "accurate account" of his show's content prior to its production. She added Harvard "does not condone the behavior or any viewpoints expressed by" Clopper during the performance.
Internal emails show Clopper not only developed his show in Harvard spaces during work hours, but that Clopper's colleagues at one point raised concerns about the performance to administrative staff. In an April 17 email to the LRC staff email list, LRC director Thomas Hammond wrote he had been made aware that some employees were "uncomfortable" about Clopper’s planned performance.
“I was sorry to learn that some of you have been made to feel uncomfortable about Eric’s upcoming Sanders performance,” Hammond wrote in the email, obtained by The Crimson. “I wanted to reach out to the list to let you know I have heard you, and we are taking immediate steps to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable here at the LRC.”
In the email, Hammond wrote Clopper will be “partitioning his multitasking better, focusing on LRC matters when working at the LRC and working with his promotions team only outside the LRC and outside his LRC working hours.”
“It’s clear that we need to do a better job of separating this project from the LRC’s normal daily activities,” he added.
Hammond also wrote he had spoken with Clopper and that Clopper had agreed to avoid discussing his performance with LRC colleagues “unless they approach him with questions, and even then will do so discreetly so that others are not a ‘captive audience for the conversation.’”
Hammond declined to comment on the email and on Clopper’s use of LRC space for this story.
Clopper said in an interview Thursday that he is an “exempt-level employee” and is held to his own schedule. He said that, in the past, he has been allowed to shoot some promotional videos when the LRC is closed.
“I do have an hour of lunch, technically, and so during that hour I’m free to do whatever I would like,” Clopper said. “Well, we always—to my knowledge—have had the policy where if you’re not interrupting LRC activities or the space is closed, you can use it for projects. We’ve always set the precedent of that, and it’s never been an issue before.”
In multiple promotional videos for the show uploaded to YouTube, Clopper dons an inflatable penis suit. Per the videos, he offered to pay people $20 a hour to wear similar suits and promote his show in Harvard Yard.
Clopper originally booked the event at Sanders Theatre as a spokesperson for Foregen—a “non-profit organization founded to research and implement regenerative medical therapies for circumcised males,” according to its website.
Tyler Drozd, the social media team leader of Foregen, wrote in an emailed statement that Clopper handed Foregen a notice of resignation prior to the performance.
“Mr. Clopper had agreed on the content of the speech which he deviated from of his own accord during the presentation, and the views expressed are his and his alone,” Drozd wrote. “Mr. Clopper is no longer affiliated with Foregen, and does not represent the company or its views.”
Clopper’s decision to step away from his position at Foregen was born of conversations with his then-coworkers at the company, Clopper said in the interview.
“I had told my colleagues that this is more of a political and ideological speech, in like, where does religion have the right to carve their religion into your body, essentially,” Clopper said. “Although my colleagues at Foregen may be sympathetic to not allowing people to carve ideologies into people’s bodies, they said, ‘We’re a medical institution, and we’re not going to be engaged in this.’”
Foregen donated over $10,000 towards the performance before his resignation, Clopper added. A pinned tweet—pinned as of late Friday night—on Foregen's Twitter account notes the company "set aside" funds for "Eric's speech."
Clopper said the rest of the funding came from another donor, in addition to around $7,000 in out-of-pocket expenses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is considering requiring gender-neutral student social groups to disclose anonymized gender breakdowns to the College in order to avoid Harvard’s sanctions, per an email sent March 25 to the leaders of some social organizations by a College administrator.
The proposal, if implemented, may add a hurdle for social groups seeking to evade the penalties—some members of social organizations previously thought adopting gender-neutral membership practices would be sufficient to elude the sanctions.
The College is also considering tying funding and use of Harvard-owned spaces to how well social organizations foster “an inclusive social atmosphere,” according to the email, obtained by The Crimson. Under the proposed “framework” outlined in the email, only social groups that “substantially contribute” to creating an inclusive environment would be eligible for both these benefits.
Director of Special Projects Christopher M. Gilbert, who works with social groups interested in going gender-neutral, sent the email. Administrators previously announced the College would develop a “new framework for governing primarily social organizations” as part of its implementation of the sanctions; Gilbert’s email outlines what appears to be a draft of that framework, though it applies only to gender-neutral groups.
In the email, Gilbert specifically requested that recipients keep the message “confidential” and asked for feedback. He repeatedly emphasized the framework is not final and is still being workshopped.
“These are not finalized plans, these details are being shared as a brainstorming process to receive your feedback,” Gilbert wrote. “This process will be ongoing and the final plans may therefore change substantially as part of our work together.”
The College’s sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of unrecognized single-gender social groups from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
In the months following the policy’s announcement in May 2016, a wave of formerly single-gender social organizations have gone co-ed. At least seven have done so, including the Fleur-de-Lis, the KS, the Aleph, the Oak Club, the Sab, the Seneca, and the Spee Club.
Under the suggested framework, these groups would be forced to submit a gender breakdown of their membership to the College in order to become recognized, avoid the sanctions, and qualify for the lowest tier of a new three-level system, per the email.
The lowest tier is titled the “Minimum Standard”; the other two, higher tiers are titled the “Standard for Recognition” and the “Standard of Excellence.” Though each level of the system confers College recognition and exemption from the sanctions, each would carry different “sets of responsibilities and privileges,” Gilbert wrote.
“The Minimum Standard is a requirement for groups not to be subject to the social organization policy sanctions,” Gilbert wrote. “This is because if the College is to acknowledge that a group is non-discriminatory in its membership policies, we must attest to that fact.”
Gilbert noted the submitted breakdown “should not include member names.”
Other administrators previously shied away from the suggestion that social groups furnish demographic data. In a Feb. 2018 interview, Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller—asked whether the College would require social organizations to release membership lists or demographic breakdowns—said Harvard does not plan to do so. The question did not ask whether the release would be public or private.
“We don’t do that with recognized organizations, so we would not do that with these types of organizations,” Miller said in the interview.
Groups would face one additional requirement for earning “Minimum Standard” status—the organizations would also need to provide “governing documents or public statements” that “attest” to non-discrimination policies, according to the email. In exchange, the College would “verify the group’s members” are not subject to the sanctions, Gilbert wrote.
In a section of the email titled “RECAP,” Gilbert also outlined the requirements for the other two tiers.
To achieve the “Standard for Recognition”—the second-highest tier in the system—groups must fulfill the requirements for the Minimum Standard and must also “commit to [Faculty of Arts and Sciences] non-discrimination policy,” per Gilbert’s email. Groups in this tier would also have to “undertake some wellness programming with College offices,” he wrote.
In return, the College would “provide access” to “College controlled space, offices, advising, and resources” to these groups, Gilbert wrote.
The top tier—called the “Standard of Excellence”—is accessible only to “those groups which substantially contribute to creating an inclusive social atmosphere,” per the email. In addition to complying with FAS non-discrimination policy, these organizations would need to “substantially engage in open membership recruitment and membership development programs,” Gilbert wrote.
Groups in the “Standard of Excellence” tier would “be eligible for additional funding to support events and will be recognized” by the College with an “award of distinction,” per the email.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not answer a question asking what the proposed “wellness programming” and the “recruitment and membership development programs” would entail. She also did not answer a question asking how much money the College plans to award groups in the “Standard of Excellence” tier.
“As announced in March of this year, the Office of Student Life is currently engaged in a process of developing a new framework for governing primarily social organizations and is developing this new framework in active partnership with social groups already committed to becoming gender-inclusive or ones that have expressed interest in doing so,” Dane wrote in an emailed statement. “As we shared with the community in March, OSL hopes to present such a framework to the College community, with the goal of making it operational in the fall of 2018.”
The College held a retreat with the leaders of some social groups April 27 to “workshop details of what we hope will become the final framework for recognition,” Gilbert wrote in the email.
Dane did not answer a question asking what administrators and social group leaders discussed at this retreat.
Near the close of the email, Gilbert noted that—in previous meetings with student leaders of certain social groups—some attendees had raised concerns over “the powerful role that physical space, endowments, and access to resources play” in helping decide “relevance on-campus.” He solicited recipients’ thoughts on how the College could best provide “capital” to help students “advance an inclusive social scene” at Harvard.
“You are building something new and exciting that will shape our campus in ways that may seem difficult to imagine today, but will have lasting impact on students in the future,” Gilbert wrote. “Our role is to help unleash your creativity and support this work over the coming months and years.”

This is the third installment in a five-part series analyzing the results of The Crimson’s survey of the more than 1,000 members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard’s flagship faculty. Read the first installment here, the second installment here, and the fourth installment here, and the fifth installment here.
Roughly half of surveyed members of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences do not believe the University provides enough support for their department as a whole, according to a survey conducted by The Harvard Crimson.
The survey also revealed that a majority of respondents believe University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith are doing “good” or “very good” jobs. A plurality of respondents—42 percent—moreover believe the University’s current initiatives meant to improve diversity are sufficient, according to the survey.
The Crimson conducted a survey of Harvard’s flagship faculty over the course of two weeks in mid-April 2018. The results paint a picture of how the more than 1,000 members of FAS think about key University policies, life at Harvard, the national political climate, and pressing issues of sexual harassment both on campus and nationwide.
The 54-question survey garnered roughly 500 responses, representing more than 40 percent of the Faculty, though not all respondents answered each question. The survey, emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from April 17 to April 30 and was anonymous.
The third installment of The Crimson’s faculty survey series delves into the on-campus lives of Harvard professors, examining issues including departmental climate, faculty demographics, and perceptions of how well key administrators represent FAS members’ interests.
The Crimson reweighted data reported in this installment by ladder status and divisional affiliation (see below for methodology).
Nearly half of survey respondents reported they believe their respective departments lack sufficient support from the University.
Asked whether Harvard provides enough support for their department as a whole, 36 percent of respondents indicated they “disagree” while 14 percent indicated they “strongly disagree.” Twenty-seven percent of respondents indicated they “agree”—but just 4 percent indicated they “strongly agree.” Nineteen percent reported they feel “neutral” about the issue.
Respondents who indicated they are affiliated with the Arts and Humanities were more likely to indicate dissatisfaction than were respondents hailing from any other division. Forty-six percent of Arts and Humanities respondents indicated they “disagree” with the notion Harvard provides adequate departmental support while 14 percent selected “strongly disagree.”
Overall, respondents reported mixed feelings on whether their departments’ atmospheres are conducive to a healthy division between work and personal life.
Thirty percent of respondents indicated they “agreed” and 7 percent indicated they “strongly agreed” with the suggestion their department culture reflects a good work-life balance.
By contrast, 28 percent of respondents indicated they “disagreed” and 11 percent indicated they “strongly disagreed” with that assertion. Twenty-four percent reported feeling “neutral.”
A majority of respondents—59.6 percent—feel valued as scholars, according to the survey. When asked to evaluate the statement “I feel valued as a scholar,” 19 percent of respondents answered they “strongly agree” and 40 percent answered they “agree,” though another 17 percent responded they feel “neutral.” Seventeen percent, however, indicated they “disagree” and 8 percent indicated they “strongly disagree.”
These numbers were largely consistent across divisions with the exception of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in which 34 percent of which faculty answered “disagree.”
The University has taken several steps in recent years to improve diversity on campus. University President Drew G. Faust assembled a committee of professors, staff, and alumni in 2016 to study issues of diversity at Harvard. The group, dubbed the Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, released its final report in March.
“Achieving excellence across these pursuits requires bringing a broad diversity of perspectives, methods, and experiences to bear on any given area of study or discovery. In other words, academic excellence requires diversity and inclusion,” the report reads.
The survey—which comes on the heels of this report—indicated a plurality of FAS faculty believe the University’s efforts to make Harvard more diverse are sufficient. Forty-two percent of respondents indicated they “agree” or “strongly agree” with the statement “FAS/the University is doing enough to diversity Harvard,” while 26 percent chose “neutral,” and 32 percent answered “disagree” or “strongly disagree.”
Responses differed along gender lines. Among respondents who identified as male, around half—49 percent—said they “agree” or “strongly agree” that the University’s current diversity initiatives are adequate. Twenty-six percent of female respondents indicated the same.
Harvard has seen a number of challenges and controversies across the past decade—ranging from the 2008 financial crisis to the 2012 Government 1310 cheating scandal to the more recent, convoluted debut of the College’s social group sanctions. Forty-six percent of respondents to the survey indicated they believe Harvard handled the rollout of the penalties “poorly” or “very poorly.”
Nonetheless, a majority of respondents reported they think three of Harvard’s top administrators—Faust, Smith, and Khurana—are performing their jobs well.
In total, a majority of respondents—61 percent—indicated they believe Faust’s job performance in office has been “very good” or “good”; 23 percent selected the former while 38 percent selected the latter. Twenty-six percent labeled her job performance “okay.”
Just 8 percent reported they believe Faust has done a “poor” job, while 5 percent indicated they believe she has done a “very poor” job.
Asked whether Faust has represented their interests as FAS members well, a plurality of respondents—41 percent—indicated they “agreed” or “strongly agreed” with that statement. By comparison, 17 percent of respondents indicated they “disagreed” and just 8 percent indicated they “strongly disagreed.” Thirty-four percent reported feeling neutral.
Like Faust, Khurana garnered relatively high approval ratings. A majority of respondents—60 percent—reported they believe Khurana’s job performance has been “very good” or “good.” Twenty-two percent of respondents selected the first option and 38 percent selected the second. Of remaining respondents, 25 percent indicated they believe Khurana’s performance has been “okay,” 10 percent evaluated his performance as “poor,” and 5 percent selected “very poor.”
Approval ratings were slightly lower for Smith. A smaller number—13 percent—of respondents indicated they believe the dean’s  job performance has been “very good,” while 32 percent indicated they believe his performance has been “good”—meaning 45 percent of respondents in total reported holding a positive view of the FAS dean’s tenure.
Thirty-six percent of respondents indicated they believe Smith’s job performance has been “okay.” Eleven percent reported they believe Smith has done a “poor job” and 9 percent reported they believe he has done a “very poor” job.
Asked how well Smith has represented faculty members’ interests, a plurality of respondents—39 percent—reported feeling neutral. Roughly equal percentages reported agreement and disagreement; 32 percent indicated they “agreed” or “strongly agreed” while 29 percent indicated they “disagreed” or “strongly disagreed.”
Respondents who reported attending at least one FAS faculty meeting in the past six months were marginally more likely to believe Smith had represented professors’ interests well. Sixty percent of those who answered “strongly agree” and 51 percent of those who answered “agree” also indicated they had attended a faculty meeting.
By contrast, 81 percent of those who answered “strongly disagree” and 52 percent of those who answered “agree” indicated they had not attended a recent faculty meeting.
In general, less than half of survey respondents—41 percent—reported they had attended an FAS faculty meeting in the past six months. FAS holds these meetings monthly.
The Crimson’s survey asked respondents about their age, sexual orientation, and annual income. The survey also asked about gender and race—but, given the University already tracks and publicizes demographic information on the gender and race of FAS ladder faculty that is likely more accurate, The Crimson is not reporting that data in this article.
The majority of survey respondents—55 percent—reported their ages as falling between between 25 and 45 years of age. Of the people within this age range, 49 percent identified as female or genderqueer/nonbinary.
Among respondents who reported they fall in the 46 and over age bracket, 35 percent of respondents indicated they identify as non-male.
The overwhelming majority of survey respondents—81 percent—reported identifying as straight. Six percent indicated they identify as gay/lesbian and 5 percent indicated they identify as bisexual.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that the average salaries of tenured professors and associate professors at Harvard in 2016 were $221,382 and $124,965, respectively. FAS salaries increased by only 1.5 percent for fiscal year 2018.
A plurality of respondents who indicated they are tenured professors—41 percent—reported that their annual income falls between $121,000 and $250,000. The vast majority—69 percent—indicated their income amounts to at least $121,000.
The majority of respondents who indicated they are tenure-track—59 percent—reported an income falling between $66,000 and $120,000. By comparison, the majority of respondents who indicated they are non-ladder faculty—68 percent—reported their incomes fall between $41,000 and $90,000.
The Harvard Crimson collected electronic responses through the Qualtrics survey platform from April 17 to April 30, 2018.  A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,173 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced from Harvard directory information and departmental websites.
Of those faculty who received emails, 516 accessed the link to the survey.  A total of 498 participants answered at least one question, and 296 participants completed every question in the survey.  To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device.  This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University—information regarding gender, minority background, divisional affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents who identified themselves as ladder faculty, 34.5 percent were women and 16.2 percent were minorities. Based on data in the 2017 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 29.9 percent and 21.9 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
The Crimson previously reported that, in May 2015, 28.9 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty. By contrast, 42 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty with known divisional affiliations who were sent links to the survey, 317—or 28.5 percent—are affiliated with the Arts and Humanities, 341—or 30.6 percent—with the Social Sciences,  316—or 28.4 percent—with the Sciences, and 140—or 12.6 percent—with SEAS.  In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 39.9 percent reported an affiliation with the Arts and Humanities, 27.8 with the Social Sciences, 28.26 percent with the Sciences, and 7 percent with SEAS.
The Crimson reweighted all response percentages mentioned in this story by ladder status and divisional affiliation, the two demographic categories which saw the most significant areas of response discrepancy in the main story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 7, 2018 at 12:10 p.m.
Harvard-Yale is the second-oldest college football rivalry in the country, behind only Princeton-Yale. Since 1875, the Crimson and the Bulldogs have gone to battle 134 times in a contest that defined each team’s season, even during years in which either or both teams had no hopes of winning the Ivy League.
Since The Game has such a long and storied tradition, it is only fitting that it is played at two historic stadiums. Alternating every year, Harvard Stadium and the Yale Bowl play host to the annual mid-November showdown.
This year, though, a third famous stadium joins that group. Harvard and Yale will face off at Fenway Park in Boston on Saturday, Nov. 17.
“I think that’s pretty cool,” freshman quarterback Jake Smith said. “I’ve never even been to a Red Sox game so that might be my first time in Fenway, which will be a little bit of a different feel. I was kind of looking forward to playing in the Colosseum last year, but Fenway, all the rich history there is going to be so cool.”
Planning the venue change was in the works over two years ago, and all the pieces finally fell into place last fall. Brett Miller, Project Manager, Special Events with the Fenway Sports Group, pointed to relationships at the highest level at both Fenway and Harvard as the main driving force behind the idea.
“It was...Mark Lev, our managing director, and Sam Kennedy, the president of the Red Sox...talking with folks over here that they’ve known for years and years,” Miller said. “One, we were looking for a game, and two, Harvard was looking for a place to play it. And I think it couldn’t have made more sense with Harvard and Yale being the second-oldest college football rivalry and Fenway being the oldest [Major League Baseball] park in the whole country.”
Fenway, which made its debut in 1912 as the home of the Boston Red Sox, is nine years younger than its counterpart in Allston. Harvard Stadium opened its gates for the first time in 1903, and the Yale Bowl followed shortly thereafter in 1914.
A few decades ago, Fenway was a semi-permanent football venue. The Boston Patriots played some of their home games at the ballpark when they were part of the American Football League, before joining the National Football League in 1970 and rebranding as the New England Patriots in 1971.
Fenway has played host to college football games in the recent past. In 2015, Boston College and Notre Dame played a neutral-site game there. Last year Fenway introduced its first Gridiron Series, in which it hosted three college games—including Dartmouth against Brown—and a slate of high school games.
“I’m really excited...to play in Fenway, super classic place,” sophomore linebacker Joey Goodman said. “Just hope the fans actually come, they don’t just go to the tailgate.”
Tailgating opportunities seem to be one of the main reasons why Harvard students come out in droves to support the Crimson. Though football fans surely abound as well, many undergraduates view The Game as more of a festive end-of-semester activity.
“We’re working on a lot of neighborhood entertainment options, and we’re trying to duplicate the experience we have over here [at Harvard],” Miller said. “There’s obviously some things that just aren’t going to be the same, but we’re working pretty diligently because we know that that’s such a big part of the game and the atmosphere.”
There is precedent for pregame entertainment at Fenway, however.
“With Notre Dame, we turned that into a whole fan fest and that was an incredible atmosphere, and if we’re able to do the same thing for Harvard-Yale I think that would be awesome, but nothing is set in stone,” Miller said. “We look forward to finalizing that and releasing all those details in the next few months.”
At first glance, Fenway Park does not appear to be an ideal venue for a football game. Many seats are low to the ground, which can obscure fans’ views of the action, and the seats are angled in such a way to be optimal for baseball, not football.
“Obviously the lower seating is not as ideal,” Miller said. “It’s great for baseball. That’s why we play baseball there, but it’s pretty cool for football. And it’s loud.”
According to Miller, the student sections will be in the “outfield bleacher area,” which likely means these sections will be located behind and to the side of one of the end zones.
“I had concerns about it, but actually starting with Notre Dame and Boston College back in 2015 and going through last year, it’s incredible,” Miller said. “It’s such a small, intimate park, and unless you’re sitting directly behind a pole, which there’s about four seats in the whole park that do that, it’s a really great view.”
Fenway Park is not unique in hosting college football games in the fall. According to Miller, neutral-site games are becoming more popular in the collegiate ranks.
"I think if you’re going to move it, you’re going to be moving it to a place like Fenway,” Miller said. “Sort of offers that same historical perspective and relevancy. I think people are going to stay for every second of the game and enjoy it and know that it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity probably.”
Though playing a storied rivalry game at such an historic ballpark is surely different than any run-of-the-mill game, Harvard football will have to wait until time expires in the fourth quarter to take it all in.
“When the game rolls up, we’re just going to treat it like another game and another day,” junior running back Charlie Booker said. “It’s definitely not just another day, but that’s just the mindset I always have to go in with.”

CORRECTION: May 7, 2018
A previous version of this story stated that Harvard-Yale is the third-oldest college football rivalry. In fact, it is the second-oldest and the third-most played.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduates from the Ivy League institutions have won Nobel prizes, formed multinational corporations, served on the Supreme Court, and become president. But no Ancient Eight grad has ever been able to boast even one set victory in the NCAA Men’s Volleyball Championships.
Next year four of them will.
Prior to this season, Harvard had never made an appearance at the championships and the Ivy League hadn’t sent a representative in over 20 years. In its inaugural trip to the tournament, however, the Crimson squared off with 19-time champion UCLA on the Bruins home turf. Just under 2600 miles from Cambridge, Harvard fell to the historic juggernauts but before doing so, notched the division’s first ever set victory.
Under the lights of the Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, Calif., the Crimson (13-14, 10-4 EIVA) went up one game Tuesday before dropping three consecutive to the home team.
The match represents only the second time the two programs have met, the first coming last season when UCLA (25-7, 9-3 Mountain Pacific) swept Harvard in three sets by an average of 10 points in each stanza. This year told a different story.
Prior to beginning to the match, a head injury suffered in practice the day prior sidelined senior Brad Gretsch. In the EIVA tournament last week, Gretsch contributed 30 kills and a .378 attack percentage, enough to earn the middle blocker and outside hitter the Most Outstanding Player award at the tournament.
Despite the hit to the roster, the Crimson came out Tuesday night swinging and took the first set 25-23. Tied at nine apiece, junior Trevor Dow notched two consecutive kills followed by an ace from sophomore Matt Ctvrtlik established Harvard’s three-point lead. On the heels of an Bruins three-point run, the home team stole back its second lead of the night at 20-19. The Crimson returned the favor with a three-point run of its own, quickly erasing the one-point margin and establishing a lead from which UCLA never recovered.
“I couldn’t be more impressed of how they fought, especially [because] we lost a key player this morning in practice and we were down for a little bit,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “But to come out and fight like that, compete against a team like UCLA in this kind of environment showed a lot.”
Throughout the entirety of the match, Ctvrtlik headlined the offense for the the Crimson squad, leading the team with eight of the team’s 35 kills. Dow and sophomore Erik Johnsson added six apiece to that total. The Bruins’ Christian Hessenauer led the match with 22, teammates Daenan Gyimah and Jake Arnitz each landed 11 kills.
The first set featured Harvard’s best team hitting of the night at .348 percent—still lower than UCLA’s .367 hitting percentage in the set.
The Crimson’s backbreaker came in set number three as the Bruins claimed the bout, 25-11. Both teams tied with a set, the domination began from the first serve. UCLA busted out five straight points to open the stanza. At 4-8, the Bruins didn’t lift their foot off the pedal and buried Harvard in a 6-1 onslaught to claim a nine-point lead. The set featured the Crimson’s worst hitting percentage of the match, -.083.
“I think we broke down a little bit at the beginning, and then being down 5-0 especially against a team that good can be a little tough to fight back,” co-captain Riley Moore said. “We tried our best to try and get the momentum back. That whole set, we just kind of looked a little defeated, a little down. But I was proud of how we came back in the fourth set, especially after a really tough third where we couldn’t really figure out how to get our offense going.”
In the two other sets, the second and fourth, Harvard failed to break 21 points, giving the home team the 25-21 victories both times.
Across the four sets, Moore led the team in hitting percentage striking a .500 percentage. Ctvrtlik was the next most accurate at .300. In assists, senior Marko Kostich led the team, grabbing 17 while Ctvrtlik, again at number two on the roster, found 15. Comparatively, UCLA’s Micah Ma’a landed 46 assists by himself, more than all of the Crimson’s roster combined.
Defensively, sophomore Chase Howard led the team with 15 digs, while co-captains Jack Heavey and Moore each put up four blocks at the net. Prior to the game, Harvard was fifth in the nation in digs per set at 9.79 as Howard individually stood at seventh.
The Bruins harbored the advantage of numbers by granting 10 different players time on the court, while the Crimson managed a seven-man rotation.
With the victory, UCLA advances to the quarterfinal round of the national tournament to play No. 2 Brigham Young University. BYU already bested the Bruins once this season, downing the team in the Mountain Pacific championship match three sets to one.
“[Harvard] made us work for every single point,” UCLA coach John Speraw said. “I think that we’ll learn a lot from it. These NCAA Tournaments are important because they aren’t always comfortable. Sometimes, you don’t play great and you can learn a lot from that experience. I think that we’ll go back and learn a lot and be better on Thursday.”
