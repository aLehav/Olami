After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sasha and Marcus (Miya Cech and Emerson Min), childhood friends in 1996 San Francisco, share everything, from Marcus’ mother’s kimchi jjigae to appropriately dated Wayne’s World Halloween costumes. Fast forward seven years, and a family tragedy brings Sasha and Marcus (now played by Ali Wong and Randall Park, respectively) closer than ever before — which, after some clumsy fumbling, culminates in the pair losing their virginity to each other in the backseat of his battered Corolla.
The ensuing awkwardness separates the best friends for 16 long years: 2019 sees Sasha celebrating a successful career as a prolific chef and restaurateur, while Marcus sticks around the circles of their upbringing, still performing in local venues with his hip-hop band Hello Peril (colonialist pun intended) and assisting his aging father (James Saito) with the family business. Yet when Sasha returns to the Bay Area for her latest restaurant opening, an unexpected — and yes, duly uncomfortable — encounter brings Sasha and Marcus together again. And again, and again, until they’re forced to reckon with the fact that they just might be destined for each other. Keanu Reeves be damned.
Like most rom-coms, there’s nothing “maybe” about their pairing. From the film’s opening frames, “Always Be My Maybe” clearly wishes to situate itself among the ranks of “When Harry Met Sally,” “Just Friends,” “Some Kind of Wonderful,” and other best friends-turned-lovers fare. Its setup is both admirably realistic, yet tinged with that whimsical caricature quality of classic romantic comedies. Sasha’s other paramours aren’t right for her, including her corporate-minded, Adidas tracksuit-clad manager Brandon (Daniel Dae Kim) and celebrity boyfriend (Keanu Reeves, in a bravura comedic turn). In turn, Marcus dates an equally ill-suited partner: Jenny (Vivian Bang), an environmentalist hippie so granola, she sports a head of unruly dreadlocks. “How does an Asian person even cultivate dreadlocks on their head?” Sasha asks, to which Marcus replies, “A crocheting tool is involved.”
Even though Sasha shoots for the moon and Marcus plays it safe, the film insists that they’re perfect for each other, but just can’t see it for themselves. Yet it’s hard to imagine Sasha and Marcus ending up together, even in the fictive world of Ali Wong’s creation (she penned the screenplay, along with Park and Michael Golamco). Maybe it’s because Wong, whose professional background is stand-up comedy, feels more like she’s in a cameo appearance as Ali Wong than a character role. Or maybe it’s because Sasha and Marcus’ lives have diverged too far: One smokes weed in his childhood bedroom, while the other wears evening gowns on red carpets and frets about Gubi furnishings. Match made in heaven, this is not.
Reasonably, their lifestyle imbalance emerges as a point of contention in the burgeoning relationship that Sasha and Marcus try to pursue. “I just don’t want to be some dude on your arm, so you don’t have to show up to places alone,” Marcus says indignantly, to which Sasha counters, “What’s wrong with that? What’s wrong with you supporting me? No one would question it if it were the other way around.”
Sasha’s got a point there. Here, “Always Be My Maybe” smartly hints at the emasculation of Asian men, which last year’s “Crazy Rich Asians” handled by trotting out shirtless Asian bachelors with varying degrees of ab definition. Yes, that’s what Wong and Park get right in “Always Be My Maybe” — the appropriate counterpoint to emasculation is not objectification, but emotionality; not sex appeal, but depth. And like “Crazy Rich Asians,” “Always Be My Maybe” celebrates ambitious, driven Asian-American women: “I don’t need you to live my life, but I need you to understand that this is my life,” Sasha says.
Marcus eventually comes around, which isn’t much of a spoiler in a film that abides dutifully by genre formulas. There’s a last-minute rush to deliver a rousing monologue at a pivotal moment, a dénouement that reconciles Sasha’s careerism with Marcus’ ties to home. It’s a sweet conclusion, but it’s also unsurprising — it almost makes us wish for the signature raunchiness and originality of Wong’s stand-up shows. To that end, “Always Be My Maybe” bears the slight, bitter tinge of Netflix Original mediocrity, that banal air of capitalistically motivated art. It ends up feeling like the result of a series of algorithms on user-driven data, meant to galvanize the Subtle Asian Traits crowd. It’d be nice to believe that films embrace diversity not for the business case or the profits, but because it’s the right way to tell meaningful stories.
“Always Be My Maybe” works best not as a love story, but a love letter to the places that have shaped these comics, from city blocks to well-loved dim sum joints where the waitstaff know their clients by dumpling order. It’s an affectionate picture of middle class Asian America with all the signature touches: sneakers removed at the door, hand-folded mandu, scallions cut with a trusty pair of kitchen scissors. It’s also a clarion call to safeguard these traditions from encroaching gentrification, or as Marcus cynically terms one of its symptoms, “elevated Asian cuisine.” He continues to protest, “Asian food isn’t supposed to be ‘elevated.’ It’s supposed to be authentic.”
But in an era of marketing “diverse” stories to “diverse” audiences, which increasingly requires collapsing culture into consumable bite sizes, authenticity becomes a murky territory. What does it mean to make culturally “authentic” art? Who is it for? Marcus delivers the fatal blow: “You’re just catering to rich white people.” You can sense the production team straining to embrace authenticity like Marcus, while being slightly complicit in pandering to as broad an audience as possible, like Sasha. It’s the difference between high-concept Asian fusion and home-cooked dishes “in a big ass bowl”: slight, but discernible to the right palates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 15, Karen Russell visited the Harvard Book Store to discuss “Orange World,” her new short story collection. Russell, whose novel “Swamplandia” was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 2012, attracted such a large audience that some attendees sat on the floor, stood in the back of the room, and even watched Russell speak from closed-circuit televisions elsewhere in the bookstore for the duration of the one-hour event.
Russell began by reading the first half of her collection’s title story. Her signature wit — the New York Times Book Review has praised Russell’s work as “hilarious, exquisite, first-rate” — was on full display as she interrupted her own reading to provide running commentary. “I tried to do the Australian accent and was encouraged by many people, many people that I knew and some that I didn’t, not to do that again,” Russell said, explaining her decision not to attempt reading a character’s dialogue with an accent. “The joy of reading is that you’ll have to queue in up in your head. Everyone knows what an Australian accent is. Except for me.”
At times, Russell jokingly questioned some of the details in her story. “‘She fishes for the clasp of her bra. Her breasts are straining against the thin lace,’” Russell read. “I pause to tell you,” she added, “that I read this detail recently and was like, that is not autobiographical. Who is wearing a lace bra? You know… ‘Her breasts are straining against her stained Hanes clearance bra.’”
When Russell finished reading from “Orange World,” she transitioned directly to an open Q&A. “Since it’s just me up here, I think I will just take questions from you guys,” she said, addressing the audience.
Much of the Q&A centered on Russell’s experiences with pregnancy, motherhood, and writing. The story “Orange World,” which is about a new mother who breastfeeds the devil to ensure her newborn child’s safety, was inspired by the period during and after her first pregnancy. “[‘Orange World’] was the only story I was able to write, actually, in the wake of my son’s birth. He’s two now. And it took a long time — I was totally muted by that experience,” Russell said.
“This was the first time ever in my writing career that I’ve tried to write about something in the midst of an experience,” Russell continued. “Usually there’s a lag of years. I couldn’t write about childhood until I had exited that peninsula. You almost can’t see it from the inside… You don’t have the perspective. But I think because this new landscape I was living in, this psychological terrain of pregnancy, this new weather, was so extreme, I thought, we need to find a story shape. And I was strangely very happy when the devil showed up.”
One audience member asked about the effect of Russell’s current pregnancy on her writing. “You mentioned you were muted for a couple years. Are you unmuted? And will you be muted again?” he asked.
Russell responded with uncertainty. “I will give a too-candid response to that, which is that I’ve been working on a novel for years now. And it’s sort of like a friend said, sort of like riding a horse that keeps changing shape underneath you. That metaphor isn’t even the whole truth of it… You’re changing shape too, for me very literally right now,” she said, gesturing to her abdomen.
“The world has changed so much. That’s the thing about novels, they take so long and then whole revolutions happen… I am really committed to this book,” she said, referring to her novel-in-progress, “but I feel like I need to find a new way in because I tried to return to it right after our son was born… So much had changed for me that I felt like I locked myself out of the house a little bit… But I’ve been writing stories, and that feels good.”
Even those attendees who were unable to find seating were delighted by Russell’s visit. Lily C. Mysona, who works at the Malden Public Library, came to the event with her colleague, Caitlin R. Quinn.
“We got here a little late, so we couldn’t stand in the actual room. We watched on the TV, but it was amazing,” Mysona said. “I’m so glad that I did this. [Russell] is just so down-to-earth and funny and lovely.”
Melinda J. Li ’19 also reflected positively on the event. “I read [the story] ‘Orange World’ over the summer when it first came out in the New Yorker, and it was really beautiful to hear it in her voice. There were so many comedic moments that I feel like I picked up on at the live reading of it… And it’s also just an amazing story.”
Salem resident Jack Butterworth expressed similar sentiments. “I’ve been a fan of Karen Russell’s since Stephen King chose [Russell’s story] ‘St. Lucy’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves’ in 2007 for the best short stories of the year,” Butterworth said, referencing the anthology “The Best American Short Stories 2007,” which King guest-edited. “I just really enjoy reading her work.”
