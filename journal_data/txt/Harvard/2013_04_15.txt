After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It can happen here, and it does.
Sexual assault plagues college campuses nationwide. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control study pegs the number of women who fall victim to sexual violence before or during their college careers at 20 to 25 percent and the number of men at 3 percent.
Despite these facts, many Harvard students might want to believe that sexual assault could not possibly pose a serious problem on a campus known for hosting some of the best and brightest students in the world. They would be wrong. In 2011, 26 Harvard students filed reports of assault with on-campus officials, and 85 to 95 students informed the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response that they had experienced some form of sexual harassment or misconduct.
Since 2010, OSAPR has attempted to address these issues through Sexual Assault Awareness Month. We support OSAPR’s efforts through Sexual Assault Awareness Month to encourage students to confront a very real problem facing college students here and elsewhere. We also commend the organizers’ pragmatic approach of reaching out to many student groups, including social organizations off campus, which demonstrates their commitment to changing campus culture in a positive and lasting way.
Thankfully, this year has already seen a significant push to bring sexual assault to the forefront of student discourse. This fall, 85 percent of students voted in a referendum to urge Harvard to “reexamine its sexual assault policies and practices.” Soon after, a panel made up of representatives from the Administrative Board and Harvard University Health Services, among other groups, convened to carry out the job. And last month, The Crimson published an in-depth examination of sexual violence at Harvard that gained considerable notice on campus.
These initiatives, along with Sexual Assault Awareness Month, aid in the fight against a damaging culture of victim-blaming and victim-silencing. Spreading information about the realities of sexual assault encourages victims to seek help or justice by assuring them that they are not alone, and neither are they at fault.
Making sexual assault a commonly discussed topic also puts pressure on those in authority to take action. For example, this paper has recommended that the Ad Board reform its handling of sexual assault cases by adopting the preponderance of evidence standard along with the standard of affirmative consent. The administration would also do well to release public statistics that would shed more light on where sexual assaults occur among Harvard students.
Sexual Assault Awareness Month has the potential to accomplish this much and more, especially given OSAPR’s decision to spread its message actively to off-campus social organizations. Sexual assault, of course, can occur in any social setting, and many parties at Harvard take place not in dorms or dining halls but at fraternities and final clubs. By dedicating itself to drawing these and other off-campus locales into the conversation about sexual assault, OSAPR is recognizing the social reality at Harvard and taking steps to improve it.
Sexual assault plagues the nation, and it plagues Harvard as well. We praise Sexual Assault Awareness Month as an effective, practical attempt to change that status quo for the better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When my roommate designated our dorm room a BGLTQ safe space by affixing a tiny square of fluorescent pink to our door, it troubled me. The “safe space” signs are a staple on this campus. However, by designating certain areas as BGLTQ safe spaces, we inadvertently imply that all other spaces, by comparison, are not safe for BGLTQ  members of our community. In a campus environment that is exceptionally diverse, every space should be safe for all students. Indeed, “safe space” signs serve as a potent indicator that we need to rethink the boundaries of spatial inclusivity on our campus.
Last year, the University established the Office of BGLTQ Student Life in the basement of Boylston Hall, garnering praise but also criticism from some undergraduate members of the BGLTQ working group that prompted its creation. Chief among the criticisms was a spatial complaint: Like the existing Queer Resource Center in the basement of Thayer Hall, the new BGLTQ office is underground. Its subtle location raises concerns about visibility from both the student and administration perspectives, prompting anxiety that the office’s location, below an academic building, hinders its ability to function as a welcoming and well-utilized social space for students, while seeming to send the message that administrators wish to quietly appease student concerns rather than offer a comprehensive response. In essence, does out of sight equal out of mind?
Of course, BGLTQ spaces are hardly the first of Harvard’s demographic-specific spaces to be relegated to subterranean levels. The basement networks of freshman dormitories play home to several spaces that serve cultural, religious, or social needs: For example, the Hindu and Muslim prayer spaces in Canaday basement. Centrally located in the Yard, these spaces provide functionality and privacy for the student organizations that occupy them, but remain effectively invisible to the rest of the student body. The use of basements becomes problematic when poorly visible spaces are meant to serve a large demographic, as evidenced the Harvard College Women’s Center, which is utilized by very few of Harvard’s more than three thousand female students, no doubt at least partially due to its location in Canaday basement.
Peer counseling centers, too, reside squarely below ground. Low-key basement locations rightly emphasize the confidentiality of counseling services, but these centers ought to be located in somewhat visible locations so as to encourage visits from both students who are hesitant to seek counseling and those who have not considered counseling but may benefit from it. With Room 13 nestled discretely near the laundry room in Thayer basement, it’s no wonder our campus culture continues to languish in the lack of open discourse about mental health.
The spatial misallocation of Harvard’s safe spaces extends from underground to far above entryways, and it proves particularly troubling with respect to spaces that support victims of sexual assault. Although each House trains a number of resident tutors to provide Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment support, leaving it up to the students and tutors to decide where to meet privately, few students are aware that another resource, the university-wide Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, is open daily to students for in-person assistance, in addition to phone and online support. OSAPR is located on the seventh story of the Holyoke Center, whose offices are rarely frequented by most undergraduates. The relative obscurity of OSAPR’s location especially disadvantages freshmen, because there is only one SASH proctor available to the entire class of 2016. Moreover, the spatial incongruity of OSAPR’s modest residence tucked away in an administrative building seven stories above ground level, in contrast to the thousands of square feet of multimillion-dollar Harvard Square real estate dominated by social organizations alleged to perpetuate sexual violence, reflects a stunning social incongruity on this campus. If the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response were as visible and centrally located as the final clubs whose convenient addresses help them monopolize many students’ Friday nights, perhaps the status quo of sexual violence at Harvard would be different.
Over the course of the next decade, the House renewal project will provide necessary amelioration through recognition of spatial needs such as gender-neutral facilities, at least in the residential sphere. In the meantime, spatial incongruities call for a campus-wide intellectual renovation of sorts. In order to decide how best to restructure our spaces, we must first restructure how we think about inclusivity on campus, especially by resisting the tendency to defer safe spaces to poorly visible locations in lieu of openly institutionalizing demographic-specific spaces. Only then will we progress toward a campus culture in which we might eschew the impulse to compartmentalize supportive spaces in the first place—a Harvard where fluorescent pink signs no longer need to exist. We must strive to foster an environment in which safe spaces are the norm, not the exception.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The debate over abortion issues has always been conducted through the legal system, yet with the recent trend to legally impede its practice, women’s rights and judicial supremacy hang in the balance.
Alabama is about to join other conservative states that have passed laws which push the boundaries of abortion rights. Last week, Alabama moved to tighten the regulation of clinics and medical personnel by requiring that doctors performing abortions, who often travel through the state, obtain hospital privileges. By imposing new building and equipment requirements, the legislation also necessitates the remodeling of clinics and the purchasing of beds and equipment—a change that could result in millions of dollars’ worth of expenditure for what, according to the clinics, appears to bear no true medical significance. The infectious series of new laws, spreading through many conservative states, that limit the operations of abortion clinics seems more akin to a strategic move of anti-abortion proponents rather than the betterment of women’s health and maternal rights, which the new laws are presented as promoting. While these new initiatives add more fuel to the debate on abortion, what should be taken up as a concerning factor is the apparent manipulation of the law and the circumventing of court-established guarantees by representatives of the government in order to enforce their own ideals.
When read in broader national context, Alabama’s new legislation, termed the Women’s Health and Safety Act, appears more concerned with advocating and satisfying the opinions of anti-abortion activists than protecting women’s wellbeing. Governor Jack S. Dalrymple of North Dakota, which passed its own law restricting abortion rights, said in a statement, “This bill is ... a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade,” which suggests that concern over maternal health was not the primary factor behind that piece of legislation. Indeed, the restrictive nature of the act would most likely have the opposite effect. It rescinds 40 years of women’s rights and safety gained when Roe v. Wade legalized abortion if the fetus was not viable outside the female body. If its shortening of the period when abortions are legal forces women to seek illegal options to end their pregnancies, it will bring the 21st century back to the pre-1973 era of coat hangers and shanty rooms, whispers and maternal deaths. By making it more difficult for a woman to get an abortion, it merely forces the practice underground, a consequence that is truly detrimental to women’s health.
Not only is limiting the practice of clinics injurious to maternal health, but the legislation also appears to be inherently unconstitutional. Arkansas and North Dakota set the limit on when a woman may get an abortion at 12 weeks and 6 weeks respectively. Yet Roe v. Wade decreed that an abortion could take place up until the fetus is viable outside the womb, and this limit is considered 24 weeks into pregnancy by the medical community. Not only do Arkansas’ and North Dakota’s new acts thereby conflict with Roe v. Wade, but by requiring women to form a concrete judgment before 6 weeks into their pregnancy, they also impose a further psychological burden on pregnant women who already have to make a painful decision on whether to end their pregnancy.
Staci Fox, who heads Planned Parenthood’s Southeast division said, “Bills like these have been introduced in 42 states. This is a whole new level of attack on women's health.” Limiting access to abortion bears both physical and psychological consequences. She goes on to point out another issue which highlights the unhealthy violent extremism born out of the debate. Local doctors find it difficult to work at clinics because it could harm their reputations in conservative states; “there are safety concerns as well,” she said. Fox’s words aren’t vacuous. They are strong echoes of an incident that took place in 2009, when a Kansas abortion clinic closed after one of its doctors was murdered by an anti-abortion activist. The additional requirement of visiting doctors to obtain hospital privileges, as required by the Women’s Health and Safety Act, makes practicing even more difficult for doctors who may already fear the consequences of extremist opinions.
Finally, the new wave of legislation, with its restrictive regulation of abortion practices, will prevent a woman from making her own decisions and exerting her own agency when it comes to her body by robbing her of the opportunity for a safe abortion. What many tend to forget is that both sides of the debate want to minimize the occurrence of abortions. Yet forcing the practice underground by testing the boundaries of the law appears to be more harmful than beneficial to everyone concerned. The path to better maternal health, more informed decisions, and fewer abortions is through better sex education, accessibility to contraceptives, and counseling services. With the oppressive measures taken in many states, through manipulation of the law to satisfy one side’s ideals, female rights that were so spiritedly fought for—especially those concerning the use of a woman’s body—hang on a weakening thread.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are many adjectives that could be used to define Harvard, but if asked to pick just two that sum it up, history and excellence would likely be popular choices.  After all, Harvard is the oldest college in the United States and legacy admissions mean that from day one, students are surrounded by stories of parents meeting at Harvard, grandparents rowing crew or writing for the Crimson, and so many more bits and pieces of the fabric of individual lives that make up the greater Harvard quilt. The adjective “excellence” is also pretty self-explanatory. Arguably the best and always among the top schools in the world, Harvard’s reputation is one of academic excellence, career excellence post-Harvard, and excellence in extracurricular activities, whether pursued simply for leisure or to change the world.
However, there is a greater word that connects history and excellence, and likely encompasses most other adjectives that one could find to describe Harvard. That word is veritas. Engraved on our gates, our statues, and even our waffles, Harvard’s motto, fittingly, provides an overarching description for the college. Students and faculty are supposed to achieve excellence through the pursuit of greater truth.  Our research is done to reveal previously unknown truth. Our classes are taken to help increase our knowledge base and hone our personal perception of truth. Our extracurriculars enhance that perception of truth by expanding our minds. Finally, our careers hopefully help to further global truth or at least promote truth in the fields in which we work.
Nevertheless, it’s our history that has a more important tie to veritas. Because we hear the stories of so many Harvard alumni, whether they are family, friends, or colleagues, it becomes clear that our legacies at Harvard last well beyond four years. Our words and actions have permanence in that they are the building blocks of Harvard history for the generations to come. For this reason, the truth in our actions and in our words holds much more importance than it might otherwise.
In light of this, the lack of truth recently prevalent at Harvard is even more distressing. The Gov 1310 scandal seems to have caused a crisis of veritas at Harvard, which includes Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds’ failure to “recollect” a second search of resident deans’ emails. Where does this leave us? Though the Gov 1310 scandal is greater in magnitude than most academic dishonesty at Harvard, cheating is unfortunately a fact of life at any school. However, the Administrative Board exists to keep this at a minimum. There is no doubt that the magnitude of cheating in Gov 1310 posed a significant challenge to the system, which made it all the more important that the Ad Board and administrators acted in an efficient, truthful, and fair manner.
Instead, the opposite occurred. The Ad Board process for students involved in the scandal was lengthy, obscure and unduly stressful. Even after the Ad Board’s hearings came to a messy conclusion, the administration’s lack of respect for the truth grew clear. The first round of secret searches of resident dean’s emails ordered by Hammonds, though plausibly in line with policy  because she notified Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, still breached the trust of the faculty. When exposed, Hammonds neglected to disclose the additional searches, and then, when their occurrence became public, claimed she didn’t remember ordering them.  This again significantly violated the trust of the faculty and of the greater Harvard population.
Last year, had I received an email saying that Harvard may have searched emails to find out about river run activities, I would laughed and shaken my head at the conspiracy theories of my fellow students. This year, I wondered seriously if that rumor—thoroughly denied by the administration—could be true. I, a fairly average student by my own evaluation, seriously questioned whether the administration was checking my emails to find out about illegal parties. Where does this end? The events of the last year have proceeded to shatter the trust, which was once shared by the students, faculty, and administrators that make up the Harvard community, and it needs to stop.
Without truth Harvard fails to be Harvard. Harvard is built upon veritas. In abandoning this virtue, we not only have left our engravings meaningless, but have also caused the gates and buildings on which the engravings exist to crumble. We are part of a university that has existed for 376 years.  Through the pursuit of truth by thousands who have gone before us, it has risen to be the institution we currently enjoy. Now we are at a turning point. Will it be on our watch that the pursuit of truth that has driven Harvard for centuries slips away? Or will we be the Harvard generation that found our pursuit of truth significantly challenged, but rose as a community to proclaim that we do believe in veritas? Dean Hammonds, this is your choice. Harvard administrators, this is your choice. Faculty, this is your choice. And most importantly, students, this is our school and our choice. So what’s it going to be?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allston residents cycled through the rain to the Harvard Education Portal for a bicycle maintenance workshop hosted by the CommonWheels Bicycle Co-Op Friday afternoon.
CommonWheels—an Allston-based bicycle collective dedicated to fostering a community of cyclists—is one of ten Allston based nonprofits to receive a grant from the Harvard as a part of the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund. Last month Harvard pledged to extend the HAPF, which was founded in 2009 and has granted money to 20 nonprofits, by $500,000 dollars over five years.
CommonWheels, the only new nonprofit to receive funding in 2013, received $10,000 this year.
The Co-Op started in 2011 as what Mook called part “backyard bike shop” and “part bar”. Since then, CommonWheels has set up workshops at the Allston Village farmer’s market, run entirely by volunteers.
According to its president and founder Galen Mook, the HAPF grant has allowed CommonWheels to double in size.
“The partnership fund allows us to hit a whole new community,” said Mook. A North Allston resident, Mook said he appreciated the opportunity to expand CommonWheels into his own neighborhood.
Harvard senior associate director of community programming Mary-Helen Black said that this community improvement programming is at the heart of the HAPF.
“Harvard is a big supporter of nonprofits in Allston through a number of ways,” Black said. “There’s financial support through the Partnership Fund and programmatic support through various ventures.”
The extension of the HAPF arose out of negotiations between the University and the Allston community over the relocation of campus services to 28 Travis Street. The Travis Street project proposal was approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority last month.
In 2013, a committee of seven community members whittled twenty-two grant proposals down to ten recipients for the allocated $100,000.
HAPF advisory board member and Harvard-Allston Task Force member John Bruno told the Harvard Gazette he appreciated what the HAPF is doing for the Allston community.
“Half a million dollars in HAPF grants have already helped local organizations to survive and thrive so they could serve thousands of local residents,” he said. “The extension of this fund will continue to assist our neighbors who would otherwise go without educational and social support programs.”
Mook said that the HAPF allows CommonWheels to guarantee its ability to provide programming to the community. He plans to start a series of workshops at the Ed Portal.
“It’s not just offering services; it’s facilitating community,” Mook said. “We want to be a facilitator of community, and we’re really grateful to Harvard for allowing us to expand to North Allston.”

Harvard economics professor Raj Chetty ’00 won the John Bates Clark Medal Friday. Awarded by the American Economic Association, the award recognizes the contribution of an American economist under 40 to the field of economics. Chetty, who at 33 is one of the award’s youngest recipients, joins the ranks of famous economists like Lawrence H. Summers, Milton Friedman, Paul R. Krugman, and several Nobel Prize winners who have previously won the award.
“It’s an incredible honor to be recognized in that way for my work,” said Chetty, whose research has focused on tax policy and the impact of education on equality of opportunity.
According to Claudia Goldin, an economics professor and president of the AEA, a committee of seven people reviews the list of economists who are eligible for the prize and then presents a list of candidates to the board of the AEA. Board members then take a vote to determine the recipient.
“Raj won unanimously,” she said. “It was an extremely brilliant decision on the part of the committee.”
Faculty in the Harvard economics department said they were pleased about Chetty’s award.
Economics professor Martin S. Feldstein ’61, who also won the award in 1977 and was Chetty’s advisor when he was an undergraduate at Harvard, wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that he was delighted by the news.
“[Raj] is a great economist and a lovely human being,” he wrote.
According to assistant Harvard Kennedy School professor John N. Friedman ’02, who has co-authored several of Chetty’s papers, the award will bring attention to their field of research.
“The award will give prominence to these papers and issues we’ve been working on,” Friedman said.
Chetty and Friedman’s latest paper about the Earned Income Tax Credit will be published in the summer.
Chetty has pioneered the use of what he calls “administrative data”—data collected by governments, like tax returns—in economic research. This data, according to Chetty’s published work, allows researchers to precisely observe individual behavior. In one study, Chetty was able to link school records of fourth through eighth graders to their earnings as young adults, finding a significant effect of teacher quality on adult earnings. President Obama mentioned this finding in his 2012 State of the Union Address.
Chetty added that he hopes the award will reinforce the leading role of Harvard’s economics department.
“We are very happy for the department and for the type of work we’re all doing, which is policy-relevant database work,” he said. “We’re excited that it’s been recognized this way by the profession and by the broader public.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: April 17, 2013
An earlier version of this article misquoted economics professor Raj Chetty ’00 as as saying that he and his colleagues do “policy relevant to database work.” In fact, Cetty said that his department produces “policy-relevant database work.”
CORRECTION: April 22, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a study by economics professor Raj Chetty ’00 mentioned in a State of the Union address analyzed the school records of kindergarteners. In fact, the study examined the school records of fourth through eighth graders.

In an email to University President Drew G. Faust last Friday, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Docket Committee asked for clarification about the scope and timetable of an outside investigation of Harvard’s email search scandal commissioned by Faust.
The committee, which sets the agenda for monthly faculty meetings, also asked Faust to make clear whether or not the findings of the investigation will be shared with faculty and what form such a disclosure might take, according to history professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, the vice-chair of the Docket Committee.
The request comes almost two weeks after Faust told faculty at their monthly meeting on April 2 that she had commissioned Boston attorney Michael B. Keating to “verify” the findings of an initial internal investigation of the searches. Though she said in an interview last week that Keating would ultimately report to a special subcommittee of the Harvard Corporation, Faust had not yet clarified what that investigation might look like or when it would occur.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said on Sunday that the details of the outside investigation have not yet been determined.
“Conversations between Mr. Keating and the Corporation subcommittee to which he will report are ongoing and the timetable and scope of his review have yet to be finalized,” Galvin said in an emailed statement.
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, a member of the Faculty Council, said that those findings will not bear much significance unless shared with faculty.
“It can’t really be a fully persuasive document unless its findings are publicized in some way,” Thomas said.
The committee’s email to Faust was co-signed by biological oceanography professor James J. McCarthy and computer science professor Hanspeter Pfister, the committee’s two other faculty members.
Absent from the email was the name Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith, the chair ex officio of the Docket Committee. Smith authorized the secret search of the resident deans’ administrative email accounts last September in the hopes of identifying the source of the leak of what was deemed confidential Administrative Board communications about the Government 1310 cheating case. Smith wrote in a March 11 statement that those searches had been limited to resident deans’ administrative accounts and that no further action was taken after the searches identified the resident dean who had forwarded an internal advising email to two students.
But on April 2, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds revealed to faculty at their monthly meeting that without Smith’s permission, she had subsequently ordered an additional set of searches of the administrative and faculty email accounts of the resident dean in question. Without Smith’s signature, those searches explicitly violated the FAS faculty email privacy policy.
“I think we need to distinguish what happened in September from what happened in March,” Jasanoff said on Friday. “I think that I and a lot of other faculty were very upset to find out what we were told in the March 11 statement was not the whole truth.”
With several College administrators already challenging key aspects of the April 2 statement, senior faculty members said this weekend that top deans had degraded much of their credibility regarding the searches. Even if the searches were carried out with the best intent, only a truly third-party report can now bring transparency to the case, they said.
“I just feel that we really haven’t gotten to the bottom of the conflicting stories yet,” said classics department Chair Mark J. Schiefsky. “It was good to have the apologies at the meeting, but there remain questions of what was done, when, by whom, and possible conflicts with FAS policy.”
Government professor Theda R. Skocpol said that news of the searches has been “deflating” for faculty members, many of whom do not know how to react. Skocpol, like other professors, said that the Keating report will only carry weight if it is completely transparent.
“I think a lot of people feel that there are murky areas and that some of the murkiness is disquieting, so if President Faust can commission something that looks independent and honest and above all thorough, I think that would be helpful if it’s public, but I don’t know if it will be,” said Skocpol, the former dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Harvard’s proposal for the Barry’s Corner Residential and Retail Commons in Allston was unanimously approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority board Thursday evening. The project is slated to break ground in the fall of 2013.
The approval came after months of often-heated negotiations between the University and Allston residents, who have frequently voiced frustration at what they say they perceive as Harvard’s lack of dedication to community benefits.
The Barry’s Corner commons, located at the intersection of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street, will contain 325 rental residential units over 40,000 square feet of retail space.
Leslie G. Cohen, the senior vice president of development at Samuels & Associates—the firm charged with developing Barry’s Corner for Harvard—wrote in a statement that the complex is “a key component in the creation of a new, vibrant, pedestrian-friendly destination in the North Allston neighborhood.”
According to a statement from the BRA, Harvard’s proposal consists of several community-oriented components, including the creation of new open spaces at Barry’s Corner and transportation improvements to facilitate car and bike sharing.
However, Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said that community benefits and concerns were not adequately addressed by the proposal.
“Harvard committed to a balance between what was good for the University and what was good for the residential community,” Mattison said. “That balance was thrown out the window.”
Mattison said that the proposal failed to adequately address community anxieties about public spaces and transportation. He also expressed concern about the expected rents of the residential units, which he said were higher than initially proposed and therefore less accessible to lower income residents.
Harvard associate vice president of public affairs and communications Kevin Casey said that the development would stimulate the neighborhood economy.
“The ... Commons is the first project in a decade-long vision for Harvard development in Allston ... and will bring economic development to the area and strengthen community connections,” he wrote in an email statement.
The Barry’s Corner complex is part of a larger series of plans for the University’s development in Allston. Other proposed developments include a new science complex, a new basketball arena, and a hotel and conference center.

Representatives of the Undergraduate Council met on Sunday for their general meeting, voting in favor of legislation that would officially request Harvard University Dining Services and the Office of Student Life—which determines dining hall schedules—to provide spring break dining starting in the 2013-2014 school year.
The Act to Reinstate Spring Break Dining, which was unanimously approved by the Council, calls for one dining hall to be open for every meal and every day during spring break, citing the dining services provided by the College for Wintersession and Thanksgiving break.
“I think a lot of students are concerned about the fact that they have no option but to spend a lot of money going out two or three times a day,” said Currier representative Sietse K. Goffard ’15, sponsor and author of the legislation.
Goffard mentioned that HUDS offered an optional spring break meal plan around 15 years ago, but that it was discontinued due to lack of interest. Nevertheless, he argued that the preferences of the student body have changed and that HUDS and the OSL should consider re-instating spring break dining. New Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde attended the meeting, and Goffard directly indicated his willingness to work on this issue with him and the OSL.
Much of the Council’s discussion of the legislation focused on the needs of students on financial aid and international students, who might have no choice but to stay on campus during spring break.
“What’s especially concerning is that a lot of the students who are here [during spring break] because of financial constraints have a hard time affording [meals off-campus],” said Goffard. “It hits them even harder.”
Representatives also held a preliminary discussion on the possibility of creating a Latin American Studies degree at Sunday’s meeting.
UC Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14 solicited initial thoughts and feedback from representatives on the issue before her planned meetings with Latino groups on campus.
“I’ve heard from students who would want to major in [Latin American Studies], but I think first it’s really important that we talk to these student organizations to see what they think is appropriate,” Zhu said.
One representative suggested that it was crucial for there to be a clear distinction between whether or not students were looking for a degree focused solely on Latin America or more generally on Latinos, which would extend beyond Central and South America.
“If this does turn out to be something that students want to see at Harvard, then that’s something that the UC should definitely investigate,” said Zhu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rep. Edward J. Markey, the candidate emerging as frontrunner in the race to replace Secretary of State John F. Kerry in the Senate, visited Harvard on Friday afternoon to make his case to students.
The event took place in the Quincy House Junior Common Room and was attended by about fifty students, many of them members of the Harvard College Democrats, a group that endorsed Markey in early February. Delayed by travel, the longtime congressman from Malden arrived around 4:30pm, and received a loud standing ovation.
When the crowd quieted down, Markey began his pitch. Speaking softly but deliberately, he immediately aligned himself with Senator Elizabeth Warren, the former Harvard Law School Professor who defeated Scott P. Brown, the incumbent, by a wide margin last November. In her victory over Brown, Warren took advantage of tremendous support from younger voters, including the Harvard College Democrats.
“My name is Ed Markey, and I am running for the United States Senate in order to partner with Elizabeth Warren and to be the vote and the voice for Massachusetts and for this next generation,” he said in introduction.
As he outlined his platform in a speech that lasted about twenty-five minutes, Markey touched on his positions on issues ranging from health care to gun control, for the latter commenting that he would support a compromise currently on the Senate floor that would extend background checks to firearm sales conducted at gun shows. Speaking more forcefully for a brief moment, he said—as he has many times throughout his campaign—that his ‘yay’ vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) “is actually the best vote of my career.”
“We have to keep that [law] on the books,” he added, cautioning against an ongoing Republican effort to repeal the bill that recently gained steam on the House floor. “[Supporting the PPACA] is part of being a Democrat in 2013. It’s part of what we have to do if we’re going to fulfill our responsibility.”
As time wound down, the congressman changed gears, openly asking those in attendance for their support, and reminding them that, even in deep-blue Massachusetts, Democratic candidates cannot take their opponents lightly.
“Just like in January 2010,” the year of Brown’s unexpected victory, “the whole country will be looking to see what happens. But this time, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to win. This time Democrats are not going to agonize, Democrats are going to organize...And it’s going to be led by young people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: April 16, 2013, at 1:20 p.m.
The final mile of the Boston Marathon was transformed into a grisly and chaotic scene Monday when two bombs exploded near the finish line at around 2:50 p.m., leaving three dead and more than 130 injured. Witnesses described dozens of victims sprawled across the course and limbs left lying amid broken glass on a blood-stained Boylston Street in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston.
Multiple news outlets reported that among the dead was an eight-year-old boy. Late Monday night, CNN reported that at least 17 people were still in critical condition with injuries from the attack, and that doctors were “pulling ball bearings out of the people in the emergency room.”
Late Monday night, Peter J. Fagenholz, a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, told reporters that he and his colleagues had performed “several amputations” that evening.
Dean Smith, a Marathon attendee, was standing near the finish line waiting for his son to finish the race when the bombs went off. He said he sustained shrapnel injuries in his leg and back, and that six hours after the blasts, his ears were still ringing.
“I was feet away from the second explosion,” said Smith, who has no relation to the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard. “My wife said I flew five feet into the air. It was like something out of a movie, and I saw lots of blood.”
After the attack, Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis recommended that residents stay home and not travel outside in large groups. He also said that each package and bag left along the marathon route was being “treated as a suspicious device.”
The Federal Aviation Administration implemented a no-fly zone around some parts of Boston, and traffic at Logan International Airport was temporarily halted to adjust the airport’s runway configuration.
During a press conference Monday night, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 called for Boston residents to “be in a state of heightened vigilance” as the investigation of the attacks continues.
Patrick said that the area surrounding Boylston St. will continue to be “locked down” until the investigation is complete.
“It’s not going to be easy, simple, or regular,” he said of mobility around the cordoned-off section of Boylston St.
Establishments surrounding the site of the explosion—Boston Public Library in Copley Square, The Shops at Prudential Center, the Copley Place mall, and the Hynes Convention Center—remained closed late Monday night.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s green, red, and orange lines was expected to resume activity as usual on Tuesday, with the exception of the Copley Station stop on the Green Line, which was expected to remain out of service.
Richard A. Davey, the state’s secretary of transportation, told the Boston Globe that T patrons could be randomly searched, and that there may be state troopers and members of the National Guard at subway stations. Exit 22 off of the Massachusetts Turnpike, which flows directly into Copley Square, was expected to be closed to traffic.
Throughout the city, large numbers of heavily armed police forces and SWAT team members are expected to be out in force.
Amidst the chaos Monday, it was hard for many runners and spectators to discern the origin of the two loud noises, spaced about 12 seconds apart.
Marathon attendee Wendy Lehman, who was awaiting her sister’s arrival at the finish line, said that she first thought the sounds might have been a speaker exploding or a signal that the race was ending.
“Not even a minute later, the second one went off, and we saw people falling into the street,” Lehman said. “The bomb threw them—blasted them back. And we started running in the other direction.”
In the aftermath of the explosions, marathon participants said they had trouble communicating with loved ones and finding transportation away from the scene.
“The biggest problem for a lot of runners right now is getting through the downtown area,” said marathon runner Malcolm Pain. “Subways are closing down, so you know it’s just havoc.”
Following the consecutive explosions, heavy use of mobile devices in the downtown Boston area overwhelmed cell phone service, preventing many users from making calls.
People at the scene of the explosions lauded the service provided by the hundreds of first responders, saying that their work was orderly and effective.
Gary Varano, who ran in the race with his wife, described the response as “instantaneous.”
“It was organized as it can be,” he said.
The nearly 13,000 medical personnel, many of whom were volunteers, came to the race expecting to treat fatigue and dehydration, but instead found themselves attending to runners and spectators with serious, even life-threatening, injuries.
Pierre A. d’Hemecourt, a doctor at Boston Children’s Hospital, was staffing the medical tent near the race’s finish line at the time of the blasts. Around two hours later, he walked away from the scene with blood on his clothes and tears on his face.
“I knew that, immediately, I had to reorganize the tent,” he said. “The medical tent was used as a mass unit to triage and get people initially stabilized and off to the hospital.”
After the smoke cleared on Boylston St., an outpouring of support rippled across the country. In Washington D.C., Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner held a moment of silence, and a somber President Barack Obama addressed the nation from the White House. His short speech, which he delivered from the press room just after 6 p.m., expressed sympathy for the city of Boston and vowed to identify and hold accountable those who were responsible for the attack.
“The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight,” Obama said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: April 16, 2013, at 4:11 a.m.
In the hours after bombings at the Boston Marathon, Harvard Square was thrust into a state of unrest following unconfirmed bomb threats, an evacuation of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and the cancellation of some evening classes. The Cambridge Police Department confirmed that the area was clear of all potential threats Monday evening.
In response to a fire and possible explosion at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, University officials closed the eponymous Kennedy School Monday afternoon, according to a University official. Law enforcement has not yet determined whether the incident at the library is related to the Boston Marathon blasts, which killed three people and injured more than 130.
The Kennedy School sent emergency text messages to students late Monday afternoon, alerting them that the school would be closing for the day and instructing them to evacuate the buildings.
University officials did not immediately employ MessageMe—the alert system used to contact students through text, phone, and email during emergencies—following the explosions at the Marathon and bomb threats in Cambridge, but administrators sent out a number of emails beginning about an hour after the threats.
In an email to Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 circulated over the Adams House email list, Associate Dean of the College John “Jay” L. Ellison reported that Harvard Yard was not under lock down, although vehicle gates were locked.
In an email to the entire Harvard community, Harvard Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp wrote that the University was monitoring the situation and that there were no reports of Harvard affiliates injured in the incidents.
Students were also asked by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds to notify their resident deans of any students running or watching the marathon.
The Extension School was also closed Monday night to accommodate students and staff limited by public transportation closures. In addition, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith confirmed the cancellation of all FAS classes and sections in an email to students, staff, and faculty Monday evening.
“We do so out of respect for the tragic events at the Boston Marathon earlier today, and in the understanding that many in our community are legitimately concerned this evening,” Smith wrote.
The decision to reschedule exams set for Monday night was left to professors, Smith wrote, and classes were set to proceed as normal on Tuesday.
Throughout Monday evening, CPD tweeted a total of dozen potential “INCIDENTS/BOMBS/THREATS,” including a number located around Harvard Square.
In response to a potential threat at Brattle Street and Farwell Place at 4 p.m., police cleared an approximately one block radius around a trash bin containing a suspicious package until the package was removed.
In another incident, officers responded to the delivery of a small Amazon.com package to Fairfax Hall at 1306 Mass. Ave. The building, which is currently being used as a swing space for Quincy House residents, was quickly confirmed as clear.
A threat was also reported at Dunster Street and Mt. Auburn Street.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 15, 2013
An earlier version of the teaser accompanying this article incorrectly stated that Harvard officials closed the Kennedy School and canceled all Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Extension School classes in response to unconfirmed bomb threats throughout Cambridge. In fact, the Kennedy School was closed due to an explosion at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, and the Extension School was closed because of transportation issues, according to a University official.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing a close, 4-3, decision to Princeton (11-6, 2-2 Ivy) on Saturday, the Harvard women’s tennis team (10-6, 2-2) rebounded with a dramatic 4-3 win over Penn (10-6, 2-2) on Sunday that went down to a final third-set tiebreaker.
Freshman Hai-Li Kong said that, although the team brought intensity to every non-conference match, in Ivy League play, the magnitude of each point and game is ratcheted up another level.
“In Ivy League play, we definitely all want it more,” Kong said. “I definitely feel like there is more meaning to our matches. Before, of course, we wanted to win, but now we want to win for our seniors and also for the Ivy League title. It’s an extra goal to aspire to.”
HARVARD 4, PENN 3
After losing the doubles point for the second time in as many matches, Harvard won three of the first five singles matches to knot up the contest. The last match came down to the wire. Trailing 3-5 in the third set, sophomore Sylvia Li rallied to break her opponent and forced a tiebreaker that she won, 7-5, to give the Crimson the victory.
“The team did a really good job of fighting this weekend,” freshman Amanda Lin said. “We were really optimistic, especially since we are just coming back from a disappointing loss last weekend against Columbia. Everybody played their hardest these past two days and left everything out on the court.”
In doubles action, co-captains Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton were defeated at line one, 8-3, and despite the efforts of Kong and junior Hannah Morrill—who won an 8-2 decision at line three—the team lost the doubles point when freshman Amy He and Lin fell, 8-4, to their Quaker opponents.
The Crimson got momentum back with quick victories in singles, as Lin rallied from a set down against Penn’s Srindhi Raghavan to take a three-set victory at line six. It was Lin’s 12th victory in a row for Harvard. She leads the team both in wins and winning percentage. He righted the ship after dropping the deciding match on Saturday, winning in straight sets. Kong completed the freshman sweep with a victory at line four, handing her opponent a 6-0 bagel to begin the match and finishing her off in a closer, 7-6(7-2), second set.
Up 3-1, Harvard could not close out the match as Tachibana and Norton lost third sets, each 6-1, to even up the match at three. Tachibana fought back from a set down to grab the second, 6-4, but fell to 8-7 on the season with the loss. Then, for the second day in a row, the match was left in the hands of Li—who converted a third set after squandering the same opportunity the day before and giving the Crimson a win.
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard’s close loss to begin the weekend dropped it to 1-2 in the Ancient Eight. After losing the doubles point, the Crimson took the first three singles matches to put it on the brink of victory but lost two three-set matches—including the clincher—to drop the contest by the narrowest of margins.
Kong, who won her eighth-straight singles match for the Crimson on Saturday, said that even in losses, the team can take solace in the way that it competes day-in and day-out.
“I think we definitely fought hard,” Kong said. “I don’t think that our team does really bad on any day. Even when we lose, we are fighting and giving it our all.”
The team’s focus on doubles during practice had yielded good results in previous matches, with Harvard winning the doubles point in eight of the previous nine matches coming in, but the team struggled and dropped the doubles point on Saturday. After Kong and Morrill got an early victory at the number three line, the Crimson lost the other two matches in quick succession.
In singles, quick wins by Norton, Kong, and Lin pushed Harvard to a 3-1 advantage. However, He dropped a one-set advantage at line two, falling to 9-3 on the season. Tachibana fell at line one, 6-2, 6-4, and the match was left to sophomore Li.
After losing the first set, 6-2, Li battled back to take a close second set, 6-4. However, in the third set, Li fell behind a break and lost it, 6-3, to drop the Crimson below .500 in the Ivy League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard faces off against rival Yale, you can expect a battle down to the wire. And that’s just what happened on Saturday at O’Donnell Field.
In an afternoon doubleheader, the Crimson baseball team (8-24, 5-7 Ivy)  split with the Bulldogs (8-21, 5-7), taking the first game by a score of 2-1 but dropping the final contest, 7-3, in a game that came down to the final inning.
“We played well enough to win, and it came down to the very last inning,” freshman pitcher Sean Poppen said. “Some things didn’t go our way, and the baseball gods kind of frowned upon us in the last inning. Although over the course of the game, we had a lot of opportunities to score. We could’ve pulled away, and we didn’t.”
YALE 7, HARVARD 3
The Crimson found itself up, 3-1, entering the top of the ninth. But the wheels fell off for Harvard just three outs away from its second win of the day.
Yale scored six runs in its last time at the plate to take a 7-3 decision and snatch a win from the Crimson.
Poppen nearly pitched his second complete game and was one out away from securing a victory. The rookie allowed only three earned runs in 8 2/3 innings while striking out seven batters.
Yale loaded the bases with no outs in the top of the ninth. When Poppen induced a double play up the middle that scored one run to make it a 3-2 game, it looked as if the Crimson would escape with the win.
But sophomore David Toups came through for the Bulldogs with a two-out single to left field that brought in the tying run.
Yale went on to score four more runs in the inning, and the Crimson went down in order to seal the loss.
Harvard began the scoring in the bottom of the second when a single from co-captain first baseman Rob Wineski plated junior outfielder Carlton Bailey. But Yale answered in the next half-inning to tie the score at one.
In the bottom of the fifth, the Crimson posted its only multi-run inning of the game when sophomore second baseman Tanner Anderson and classmate Nick Saathoff hit back-to-back RBI doubles to give Harvard a 3-1 lead.
Anderson and Wineski led the team with two hits apiece in the game. Anderson totaled four knocks in the two contests.
HARVARD 2, YALE 1
In its first game of Red Rolfe division play, the Crimson wound up in front after a hard-fought contest.
Junior pitcher Sam Dodge threw a complete seven-inning game to lead the way for Harvard.
Yale could not figure out Dodge, who allowed one unearned run and only surrendered three hits. The junior pounded the strike zone all game long, surrendering only one walk while striking out seven batters in a 104-pitch effort.
“I just came out, wanted to throw strikes early, and make them put the ball in play,” Dodge said. “I threw my fastball early, got them to take cuts, and ended up getting a lot of them out.”
The game featured effective pitching from both teams, as the Crimson registered only five hits to the Bulldogs’ three. Junior Rob Cerfolio threw six strong innings for Yale, but the two runs Harvard brought across were enough to tag him with the loss.
The Crimson seized the momentum from the outset when Dodge struck out the first three batters of the game.
Harvard went on to deal the first blow in the home half of the opening inning. After sophomore shortstop Mike Martin crushed a triple to right-center-field, freshman third baseman Mitch Klug grounded out to the shortstop to bring home the run.
Dodge continued to pitch effectively, and his team provided him with additional support in the bottom of the fourth. Anderson led off the inning with a double to right field. One batter later, Bailey smacked another double down the left field line to bring in Anderson for the Crimson’s second run of the game.
Yale scored its only run of the contest in the top of the sixth. After an error in the Harvard outfield, Bulldogs senior Cam Squires took advantage of the mistake by hitting a sacrifice fly that put his team on the board.
But Dodge buckled down and struck out the next batter to end the threat, limiting Yale to a single run. He retired the Bulldogs in order, securing the victory for the Crimson and notching his first win of the season.
“The win was huge because it really got the momentum going into game two, where we played well until the last inning,” Dodge said. It gave us a lot of momentum [Saturday], and we came into [Sunday] with a chance to win the series.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Yale rivalry is still alive through baseball season as the two teams split their four-game series to remain tied for second in the Red Rolfe Division of the Ivy League.
The Crimson (8-24, 5-7 Ivy) took the 6-2 victory in the first game Sunday afternoon largely thanks to a three-run homer by sophomore Nick Saathoff in the bottom of the fourth.
But in the following contest, the Bulldogs (8-21, 5-7) took an early lead thanks to a shaky Harvard defensive start and beat the home team for the second time this weekend, 5-2.
It was an evenly-matched set of games between the two teams, who battled for a total of almost five hours in the early spring chill.
YALE 5, HARVARD 2
The tables turned quickly in the first inning of the second game as Yale came out with a homerun into the bushes behind right field by sophomore David Toups on the first pitch of the game.
The Bulldogs scored again on a sacrifice RBI to left field by freshman Nate Adams, giving them a 2-0 lead to start the final game of the series.
Harvard coach Bill Decker knew something was different in his team’s play in the second match.
“We have some guys trying to play through with injuries, so I think fatigue got to them,” Decker said. “We’re down to one catcher, so [freshman DJ Link] had to play all four games this weekend.”
The action slowed down a bit in the rest of the game, which lasted almost twice as long as the first game, at three hours and 11 minutes.
Yale collected four of its nine hits for the game in the first frame. The Crimson also had nine hits, but no runs were scored until the bottom of the fourth, when a fielding error and a base hit gave Harvard two unearned runs to tie up the game. Despite evening the scoreboard, the Crimson did not score again, and by the end of nine innings, it left a total of 13 men on base.
“We could probably improve on doing our job at the plate—getting guys over when we need to and scoring when players are in scoring position,” sophomore infielder Tanner Anderson said.
The Bulldogs also left men on after their half-innings, including leaving the bases loaded at the end of both the fifth and sixth innings.
Both teams struggled on the mound, relying on their bullpens for more than one reliever.
“[Junior Baron] Davis gave us five pretty good innings,” Decker said. “But you can’t walk as many runners as we did, or hit batters. Those are free bases.”
Davis hit two batters in the top of the fifth, with the second knocking the helmet off of Yale senior Chris Piwinski. Davis gave up six hits and only recorded one strikeout.
Davis and junior reliever Peter Kaplan each amassed four walks, while co-captain closer Jordan Haviland recorded one more in the sixth.
“These four-game series, they’re a grind,” Decker said. “I felt like we got a little tired at the end. But Haviland has been pretty steady for us all year. He did a pretty good job trying to close for us. “
“We wanted to get four against Yale,” Anderson added. “That obviously didn’t happen, but I don’t think we’re in a bad mood about it. We played good games, they played good games, and they were all very close.”
HARVARD 6, YALE 2
The Crimson’s stronger game was the first of the day, when a combination of big scoring and solid pitching carried the team.
A few innings after a base hit and an RBI in the opening inning by Yale senior Josh Scharff, Saathoff got Harvard on the board. He sent a ball deep over the fence behind right field for his first homer and Harvard’s fourth of the season.
After a sacrifice RBI for the Bulldogs by junior Jacob Hunter in the fifth, the Crimson kept its lead by scoring three more runs in the bottom half of the inning. Anderson hit a two-RBI single up the middle.
Anderson also pitched all seven innings for Harvard, with 60 of his 94 pitches being strikes.
“Tanner pitched it pretty well,” Decker said. “He also hit the ball, and hit it well.”
“I think we came out playing pretty well,” Anderson added. “Our defense was supporting [me] behind the mound.”

The Harvard men’s tennis team put its nine-match winning streak on the line this weekend when it went on the road to face Ivy League foes No. 50 Princeton and Penn. By Sunday evening, the No. 19 Crimson (16-4, 4-0 Ivy) had extended its streak to 11 matches and improved its record in conference play to 4-0.
Harvard now sits atop the conference as it continues its bid to repeat as Ivy League champions.
Senior co-captain Andy Nguyen explained the different challenge playing on the road presents.
“It’s always a little different traveling on the road,” Nguyen said. “All of the matches are really hard fought. Princeton brought out a really large crowd and it was very rowdy. With crowds like that, it feels even better to fight and end up with a win.”
HARVARD 4, PENN 3
On Sunday, the Crimson completed its weekend road sweep by taking down the Quakers (9-9, 1-4 Ivy), 4-3, at the Hamlin Tennis Center in a match that was as tightly contested as the final score indicated.
Harvard’s No. 2 doubles team of freshman Nicky Hu and senior Andy Nguyen lost, 8-5, but sophomore Alex Steinroeder and freshman Kelvin Lam made up for the loss with an 8-5 win on the third court. The doubles point was decided on the first court, where junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen won in a tiebreaker after being down, 6-2.
The Crimson extended its lead to 2-0 after Andy Nguyen ran his record at fourth singles to 12-2 with a 6-2, 6-1 win.  Denis Nguyen took a 6-3, 6-4 victory at No. 1 singles to give Harvard a comfortable, 3-0, margin.
Andy Nguyen chalked up his success this season to increased motivation.
“It’s my senior year, and I really want to win an Ivy Championship,” he said. “So I am trying my hardest.”
Freshman Nicholas Mahlangu, playing because Hu suffered a sprained ankle, lost, 7-5,7-5, in the fifth slot, but sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri won in three sets at No. 2 to give the Crimson the clinching fourth point.
After Harvard earned victory, Lam and Steinroeder both lost in three sets for the final 4-3 margin.
“It was a dogfight today,” Crimson coach Dave Fish said. “We were fortunate to come away with the doubles point, which was huge. Sunday’s matches were just very nervy and heavily contested.”
HARVARD 5, PRINCETON 2
Saturday’s matchup pitted the Ivy League’s last two unbeaten teams against each other, with the Crimson at 2-0 after last weekend’s home sweep of Columbia and Cornell and the Tigers at 3-0. By the end of the day, Harvard stood alone after taking down Princeton (15-5, 4-1 Ivy), 5-2, on its home courts at the Lenz Tennis Center.
The Crimson showed that its recent dominance over the Ancient Eight extended to road matches. Harvard replicated its 5-2 victory over Princeton from last season in extending its win streak to ten matches.
The 55th-ranked doubles team of MacMaster and Denis Nguyen took down the Tigers’ 46th-ranked pair, 9-7, and Lam and Steinroeder scored an 8-5 victory to give the Crimson the doubles point for the tenth straight match.
In singles, MacMaster lost, 6-2, 6-1, on the sixth court as the Tigers tied the match at 1-1, but the rest of the team quickly made up for his loss. Steinroeder won, 6-4, 6-1, at No. 3, Chaudhuri defeated Princeton’s Zack McCourt, 6-3,6-4, at No. 2, and Hu won, 7-5, 7-5, on the fifth court to give Harvard its fourth point and lock up the victory.
In the rest of the action, Andy Nguyen earned a 6-4, 6-4 win, and Denis Nguyen lost to the Tigers’ Matija Pecotic, the nation’s No. 8 ranked singles player by a score of 4-6, 6-1, 6-1. Pecotic extended his singles winning streak to 19 matches, but Nguyen became the first player since April 2011 to take a set from Pecotic in an Ivy match.
While the team is happy with its performance in Ancient Eight play so far, it cannot afford to look far ahead.
“We’re confident in our ability, but also wary,” Fish said. “We won 4-3 against Penn, and it does not take much to make us vulnerable, especially if we don’t win in the last two singles spots. Every team wants to be a spoiler and go after us. It’ll be a fight until the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first weekend of postseason play, the Harvard women’s water polo team entered as the third seed and finished in that same spot.
Competing at the CWPA Southern Division Championships in Providence, the Crimson (16-14, 3-3 CWPA) defeated Mercyhurst but then fell by four goals to Brown in the nightcap.
Harvard secured third place by beating George Washington Sunday morning, 15-11.
“We got our [fifteenth and sixteenth] wins of the year, so I’m happy with that,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “I would’ve liked to be playing in the championship game instead of playing and winning third. But we played a tough Brown team last night and came up short.”
HARVARD 15, GEORGE WASHINGTON 11
The Crimson offense jumped out to an early lead and never looked back against the Colonials (14-14), riding consistent scoring to a four-goal victory in the tournament’s third place game.
Five Harvard players scored multiple goals. Junior attacker Shayna Price found the back of the net four times to lead the attack, and sophomore attacker Victoria Frager contributed a team-high three assists.
“We were pressing super hard,” freshman attacker Yoshi Andersen said. “It really started on the defensive end, and I think everybody stepped it up. We were talking a lot more, and I feel like that’s what helped us.”
The Crimson took control of the game early. Fueled by two goals from Price, Harvard scored five times in the first period of play to GW’s one.
While the two teams played an even second period, the Crimson outscored the Colonials by two goals in the third to make the score 12-6. Although GW attempted to mount an attack in the closing minutes, the deficit ultimately proved too large to overcome.
The win marked the second time this season Harvard defeated the Colonials, with the first coming as a six-goal decision just eight days earlier.
BROWN 16, HARVARD 12
In the final game of pool play, the Crimson needed a win to advance to the championship game the next day. But the Bears (15-19) were up for the challenge, and Harvard could not pull out the win, falling by four goals.
Both teams battled to a stalemate in the first three periods of play. Although Brown posted six goals in the first frame, the Crimson stayed in the game with four goals of its own.
After Harvard outscored the Bears by one in the second period and each squad totaled five goals in the third, the game was shaping up to go down to the wire.
Although the Crimson found itself within one goal at the start of the fourth quarter, Brown’s defense took control of the game and shut Harvard out in the period. The Bears would go on to score three goals to secure the 16-12 win.
“I think two or three times we came back from three goals down,” Minnis said. “You exert a lot of energy when you’re trying to come back, and we just couldn’t get over the hump and we ran out of gas. Brown did a good job, they played real well, and they had a little bit more gas in the tank in the end.”
Co-captain Aisha Price was the high-scorer for the Crimson with four goals on the game. Sophomore Ariel Dukes posted a team-high five steals and led the way for Harvard with four saves in goal.
With the win, the Bears advanced to the championship, where they lost to No. 12 Princeton, 12-4.
HARVARD 17, MERCYHURST 8
In its first game of the tournament, the Crimson dismantled the Lakers (13-13) from start to finish, cruising to a nine-goal victory.
Although Harvard had already defeated Mercyhurst, 11-3, earlier this season, the team did not take its opponent lightly in the second showdown.
Andersen led the way for the Crimson with five goals, three assists, and four steals. Shayna Price scored four times, and Aisha Price and freshman Charlotte Hendrix both found the back of the net more than once.
Although Harvard held the lead the entire game, the team was up just 6-3 after two periods. But the Crimson offense came to life in the second half, scoring six goals in the third and five more in the fourth to pull away from the Lakers.
The game was a complete team effort for Harvard, as seven different players found the back of the cage and ten people registered at least one assist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team downed Yale on Saturday at the Culver Field-Dwyer Track in New Haven, Conn., as both the men’s and women’s sides bested the Bulldogs by over 20 points each.
The win continued a streak of dominance, both throughout the Ivy League this year and in the Annual Harvard-Yale meet. The women, who beat Yale 89-69, won their sixth straight meet title while the men, who won 97-64, did so for the third consecutive time. The meet came after several Crimson runners and throwers competed across the nation for several weekends.
“This was the first opportunity for us to all come together as a team,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We’ve been going a lot of different directions, trying to take advantage of the warm weather in the South and West. It’s really exciting to see both the men and women come away with team victories.”
A flurry of sprinters topped the podiums to give the Crimson a significant points advantage.
“Our sprinters and jumpers did an outstanding job and really dominated on Saturday,” Saretsky said.
Harvard women finished 1-2-3 in the 200-meter dash, 800-meter run and 100-meter hurdles. In the 800, sophomore Erika Veidis won the event by nearly five seconds with a time of 2:05.92, setting a new personal best and notching the second-fastest time in school history.
“She’s had a phenomenal indoor season, not just winning the Ivy League Championship but making it to Nationals as a sophomore with an outstanding performance,” Saretksy said. “It’s only going to get better for her.”
Freshmen Christi Scott and Autumne Franklin took first and second place in the 200-meter, followed by sophomore Gabrielle Scott, who also won the 400-meter.
Franklin continued her rookie success as she won the 100-meter hurdles in 14.48 seconds, trailed closely by junior Olivia Abbate’s 14.57 second-place finish. Freshman Madison Hansen registered the only other sub 15-second run.
Harvard athletes swept the medals off the track as well. Sophomore Mary Hirst, who also won the javelin, cleared 1.65 meters for the win in the high jump. Sophomore Ann Giebelhaus and freshman Allison Morrison both cleared 1.60 meters for second and third.
Senior Shannon Watt captured the discus competition with a 43.79-meter throw. Junior Adabelle Ekechuwu, who is also a Crimson multimedia and arts editor, won the hammer throw with a toss of 52.65 meters, over three meters further than the second place finisher, Harvard sophomore Taylor DuPont.
Sprinters were dominant on the men’s side as well. Junior Connor McCarthy won both the 100 and 200-meter dashes with respective times of 10.58 and 21.61 seconds. Senior Jeff Homer recorded a win in the 400-meter with 49.19 seconds, just beating teammate Jared Kadich, who finished .37 seconds later.
Sophomore Jarvis Harris set a new school record in the 110-meter hurdles with a time of 14.13 seconds. His time was over a second faster than second place Daniel Kemp of Yale.
“I’ve been definitely working toward beating the school record,” Harris said. “I knew I would get it but I just had to keep training and going after it. Trusting in my coaches helped me do it…. I was definitely looking forward to aiding my team and getting to the higher level because over the past year we’ve become a lot more competitive and a lot hungrier.”
The men also captured four wins in field events. Senior Fedor Garin and Mark Hill went 1-2 in the high jump, as did sophomore Malcolm Mason Rodriguez and Harris in the triple jump.
In the shot put, Crimson throwers Ben Glauser, Dustin Broke and Edward Brucker swept the podium. Both Glauser and Brode broke the 17-meter mark. Garin and fellow seniors Jacques Barjon and Nico Weiler grabbed first, second and third places in the javelin throw.
“Traditionally our throwers are our rock that we lean upon,” Saretsky said. “They put up a decent amount of points right there and have really been gearing things towards some outstanding marks.”
After defeating the Bulldogs, Harvard athletes will now team up with Yale to take on a combined Oxford/Cambridge team on Tuesday at home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard (2-9, 1-4 Ivy) traveled to take on the No. 13/16 Tigers (8-4, 5-0) at Princeton this Saturday. The match was a tight one, with the two teams heading into halftime with a tied score, 4-4. After alternating goals, the Tigers ultimately pulled away with a two-point victory, winning 11-9.
“I think we really played one of the best games we’ve played,” freshman midfielder Izzy Wager said. “I think we just got tagged for a couple goals that we could’ve stopped. There were a couple chances where a girl was wide open in the middle…and if a couple more of our shots had gone in, just two more and then we would’ve been tied and gone into overtime, but it was a really back-and-forth game.”
Princeton opened the scoring with a free-position shot in the fifth minute. The Crimson answered two minutes later when captain midfielder Micaela Cyr registered a free-position goal of her own, her first of three on the day.
The tie did not last long as the Tigers pulled ahead with two goals in the 13th and 14th minutes to take a 3-1 lead. The Harvard offense rebounded, netting three consecutive goals. The goals came from senior midfielders Nina Kucharczyk and Danielle Tetreault from free-position shots and from freshman attack Alexis Nicolia, fed from Cyr.
A free-position shot from Princeton’s Sam Ellis in the final two minutes of the first frame leveled the score heading into halftime, 4-4.
“We talked [at halftime] about how on offense just keep with the game plan that we’ve been executing well in the first half, which was be patient and wait for good opportunities on offense,” Wager said. “Defensively we got called for little things like three-seconds in the eight-meter, which is easily avoidable, so [we wanted to] just fix a couple little things on defense.”
The Tigers came strong out of the gates at the start of the second half, with two goals in the first seven minutes. Both points came from free-position shots taken by Princeton’s Mary-Kate Sivill, bringing the score to 6-4.
The Crimson offense rallied with two unassisted goals by junior midfielder Kyleigh Keating and freshman attack Audrey Todd.
Princeton was down a player when the Tigers’ Ellis capitalized off of another free-position shot. Princeton registered seven goals off of free-position opportunities by the end of the contest.
Sivill finished her hat trick to bring the Tigers two goals ahead of Harvard halfway through the final frame. After Princeton scored its fourth consecutive goal, Cyr drilled one in the back of the net unassisted to bring the score, 10-7.
Erin McMunn tallied the Tigers’ final goal of the match with five minutes remaining. Cyr netted her third goal off of an assist from Tetreault, who buried a goal a minute later to end the scoring for the day, bringing the final score to 11-9.
“One of the major strengths is just sticking together,” Wager said. “Even if we have injuries or things aren’t going well, I think we always operate for each other and that really motivates us.”
Tetreault’s final goal put her in 10th position for all-time career goals at Harvard with 107 under her belt. Cyr led the shooting with the game-high three goals and also tallied an assist. Senior goalie Mel Cook registered four saves.
“I definitely think it’s a big momentum gain for us because we had a tough game against Holy Cross where we just didn’t play our game and didn’t play well, and then we play against a good team like Princeton and are tied at the half and lose by two goals,” Wager said. “Just being able to see our team play like that…. It was just like oh, we can do this. This is our team, this is our game, so it was definitely a momentum gain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team (16-17, 8-4) has struggled to find consistency throughout the season, splitting many doubleheaders. This Saturday, however, it all came together in dominating Yale (8-26, 3-9) in consecutive games, defeating it, 7-4, in the first game and 4-2 in the second.
“We’re a team that’s capable of big plays, [and we] definitely made some,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said.  “On the whole we played a better game.”
The wins kept Harvard in a tie with Dartmouth for the lead in the North Division of the Ivy League.
HARVARD 4, YALE 2
The Crimson clicked on all cylinders during the second game of the doubleheader, en route to a comfortable 4-2 win.
The bats got the Crimson started quickly. Harvard strung together two singles and a walk in the bottom of the first to gain a one-run lead. After a 1-2-3 inning in the second, the Crimson broke the game open in the fourth, scoring three runs on three hits and a walk.  Sophomore Emily Gusse capped the inning off with a two-run single up the middle.
The Crimson offense only put one more runner on base the rest of the game, but it did not matter as it had already done enough.
Freshman Morgan Groom took the mound in the first and never looked back, finishing the game giving up just two runs. She shut out the Bulldogs until the sixth inning when Yale sophomore Sarah Onorato pulled a ball down the left field line.
However, the Bulldogs could not muster any more runs against Groom, who dropped her ERA to 2.53 on the season—good for fifth in the Ivies—and earned her fifth win.
After struggling in an outing against Cornell last Saturday, Groom bounced back, regaining her rhythm. Groom has been a workhorse for the Crimson this season, leading the team with 81.2 innings pitched. This was her sixth complete game of the season.
Sophomore Katherine Lantz had two hits and an RBI in her fifth multi-hit game of the season. Junior Kasey Lange, who leads the team in RBI, was able to contribute in a different way, reaching base twice on two walks and scoring each time.
“We’ve just come together as a team,” Gusse said. “We’ve picked up from our mistakes and learned from them.”
HARVARD 7, YALE 4
In the first game of the doubleheader, the Crimson bats were out early, jumping out to a four-run lead by the third inning. Freshman Haley Davis had a two-run double in the top of the third inning to put the Crimson up three runs, scoring on an error later that inning.
However, the Bulldogs were able to come back and score four runs in the top of the fifth on a series of errors to tie the game up, as the screws appeared to be coming loose for Harvard. After hitting a single, and drawing a walk to load the bases, the Bulldogs capitalized, scoring four runs, two of which came on errors by Crimson catcher Katherine Appelbe.
Harvard steadied however, scoring three runs on three hits in the sixth to put the game out of reach.
On the day, Lange led the charge with two doubles, driving in one run and scoring two others. She leads the team with 31 runs batted in this season. In total, six Crimson bats drove runners home.
Throughout the game, Harvard relied on small ball to get its runners in scoring position. Junior captain Shelbi Olson stole two bases to get into scoring position after leading off innings by getting on base. In the bottom of the sixth, the Crimson also successfully sacrifice-bunted, allowing Lange to advance to third base and later score.
The pitching combination of Halula and sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz held strong. Halula started well, shutting out Yale through four. After she struggled in the fifth inning, Ruiz came in to earn the win, allowing only one Bulldog on base for the final two innings.
“It was great for Gabi and Jamie to combine, that was gutsy for them,” Allard said. “They’re a true pitching staff.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after CBS Sports named the Harvard Crimson the 21st best men's basketball team in the nation in a preseason poll for the 2013-2014 season, ESPN’s Jay Bilas placed the Crimson as the 22nd-ranked team in his early top 25 poll.
Bilas has Kentucky at the top of his poll after the signings of Class of 2017 freshmen Julius Randle, Dakari Johnson, and James Young. Reigning national champion Louisville, Michigan State, Duke, and Arizona—who defeated Harvard in the NCAA Tournament in March—round out the top five.
On Harvard, Bilas commented that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker “retains most of [his] rotation from a team that won its third Ivy League title in a row, earned its second straight NCAA tournament bid and its first-ever NCAA win.” The Crimson are the last in a series of three mid-majors that begin the 20s, ranked behind Final Four team Wichita State and second-round victim New Mexico.
Bilas cited the potential return of departed seniors Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey, as well as incoming recruit Zena Edosomwan, as reasons for the Crimson's improvement. Curry, Casey, and Edosomwan should lengthen an Amaker rotation that was as small as six players at points last season and will give the coach a variety of options at the guard and forward spots. After a year in which the Crimson had four of the top 10 Ivy League players in terms of minutes played, a lengthened bench will be a new luxury for Amaker.

Pitcher Sam Dodge took home the Athlete of the Week Award, but The Back Page recognizes other athletes in Harvard sports who excelled over the course of the weekend's games. 
Erica Veidis and Jarvis Harris, Track and Field
The two athletes were the stars of the weekend’s annual Harvard-Yale track and field meet. Veidis, a sophomore indoor All-American, won the 800 meters with a 2:05.92 mark that was the second-fastest time ever run at the event. She led a one-two-three Harvard finish in the event. On the men’s side, Harris broke the school record with his 110 hurdles victory, beating the previous one by .11 seconds with a time of 14.13 seconds.
First Varsity, Women’s Heavyweight and Men’s Heavyweight
The first varsity teams for both the men’s and women’s heavyweight crew teams put forth winning efforts over the weekend. The 11th-ranked women picked up their first win of the spring with a victory over the fifth-ranked Princeton Tigers and 17th-ranked Cornell Big Red on Saturday morning. The team won by nearly five seconds over Princeton and almost eight over the Big Red. The fourth-ranked men’s team won three of the five races against the Brown Bears on Saturday morning and took home the Stein Cup for the third straight year.
Murphy Vandervelde, Men’s Lacrosse
 
With his overtime goal against the 14th-ranked Penn Quakers, the sophomore from Wellesley, Massachusetts, sent the Harvard men’s lacrosse team to its first victory over a ranked opponent. Since scoring his first career goal on March 23rd, Vandervelde has eleven goals in five games, including consecutive hat tricks against Albany and Duke. With the win, the team attained a slim hold on the final playoff berth in the Ivy League.

After a 3-18 start to the season, the Harvard baseball team (8-24, 5-7 Ivy League) has won five of its last ten games against Ivy League competition. The Back Page looks inside the numbers to see what have been the main reasons for the team’s success in the past couple of weeks.
.444 … The team’s winning percentage at home, versus a .143 winning percentage on the road. The team has won half of its Ivy League games (four of eight) in Cambridge.
56 … Runs the team has scored in its eight wins versus only 50 runs in its 24 losses. The difference has been stark; the team has scored nearly five more runs per game in victories than defeats.
.356/.354/.710 … The team’s OBP/SLG/OPS splits in conference play (compared to .333/.305/.638 splits overall).
59 … Hits by the team in the last six games after posting only 31 in a six-game stretch earlier in the season (March 8-17).
.394 … The on-base percentage for utility infielder and outfielder Mike Martin, who has drawn 14 walks in 79 at-bats.
7 … Runs batted in by sophomore outfielder Tanner Anderson in the past eight days, who has recorded a hit in seven of the nine games the team has played in April.
1 … Senior who has thrown more than 10 innings for the Crimson so far this year (Jordan Haviland).

Harvard has not had a player selected in the NFL Draft since Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 was taken in the seventh round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Now, though, with the 2013 NFL Draft less than two weeks away, senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk has a chance to buck that trend.
Juszczyk, listed at 6’1” and 248 pounds, is considered too small to play tight end at the game’s highest level but is drawing significant interest as a fullback. The two-time All-American’s stock is rising after he showcased impressive blocking skills at the Senior Bowl in January and posted strong numbers at his pro day, including a 4.71-second 40-yard dash and 24 reps of the 225-pound bench press. Representatives from 15 different NFL teams attended his pro day.
The Crimson’s all-time leader in receptions (122), receiving yards (1,576), and touchdowns (22) for a tight end has 12 official visits planned, according to Tony Pauline on Twitter.
Juszczyk, projected as high as a fourth-round pick by some experts, has reportedly drawn special interest from two teams as the draft approaches. He will visit with the Buffalo Bills, who this winter cut ties with Fitzpatrick after Doug Marrone took the helm at head coach, and the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs, who tied for the worst record in the NFL last season at 2-14, are looking for a fullback to fit new head coach Andy Reid’s West Coast offense.
The 2013 NFL Draft runs from April 25th-27th. Until then, Juszczyk will continue to visit teams in hopes of bolstering his stock.

Harvard Law School's new coalition to combat gender disparities, called "Shatter the Ceiling," has certainly received national attention since the organization launched last month—just maybe not the response its leaders were looking for.
In a fiery piece for the Wall Street Journal, James Taranto slammed a video published by "Shatter" that tried to encapsulate the current situation for women at the Law School. Instead of agreeing with the coalition, which operates under the auspices of the Women's Law Association, Taranto concluded that the playing field was in fact tilted in favor of women as he reacted to complaints about the Socratic method and the gender breakdown at the Harvard Law Review.
According to Taranto, Harvard Law's attempt to maintain a nearly 1:1 gender ratio among its student body means that the Admissions office holds female applicants to a lower standard than it does male applicants.
Expanding on his views still further in a Wall Street Journal video, Taranto said that he would still hire a Harvard-trained lawyer, male or female—excluding those who appear in the "Shatter the Ceiling" video.
"If you're on trial for your life, you want a Harvard man representing you. Or, you want a Harvard woman—who is actually not in this video and is not whining but is actually doing the work," Taranto said.
Outgoing president of the Women's Law Association Stephanie Davidson coauthored a response to Taranto's piece with Nitzan Weizmann and Julie Brinn Siegel, the incoming president and vice president, respectively, of the WLA.
"Mr. Taranto assumes, without any evidence, that it is something innate in Harvard Law's women—their lack of equal talent and intelligence—which causes these disparities at Harvard," the HLS students wrote in the response. "That this was Mr. Taranto's instinctive explanation, and that he embraces it uncritically and without any empirical support, is alarming. In the process, he suggests Harvard Law School women are whiny and undeserving."
Davidson, Weizmann, and Siegel continue to outline the coalition's goals of acquiring data on the gender disparity at HLS and prompting real change throughout the community.
"The Socratic method was developed at Harvard Law School in the Julia Grant era," they wrote. "We want to develop law school education for the Michelle Obama age."
