After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
French political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville traveled around the United States in the mid-19th century, meeting with prisoners and politicians alike, and writing observations about American culture and governance that would become his two-volume work “Democracy in America.”
Tocqueville prized the conversations he had as a stranger in a strange land: “The stranger often learns by the hearth of his host important truths, that the latter would perhaps conceal from a friend; with the stranger you ease the burden of a forced silence; you are not afraid of his indiscretion because he is passing through.”
Like many of my peers, I spent most of last week compulsively reloading various news sites and anxiously monitoring every development in American democracy. Reading Tocqueville’s leisurely, distanced perspectives on the same subject roughly two hundred years earlier was both disorienting and calming.
I have written about the importance of engaging with strangers from different generations. Cross-century interactions seem equally valuable — and Tocqueville, I think, would agree. But though Tocqueville was at times prescient, the ways in which he missed the mark can be just as interesting.
Reading Tocqueville on elections and American democracy was a reminder that little of our current moment is new. Tocqueville thought a lot about the presidency of Andrew Jackson, whom he viewed as a vacuous populist. “Strong due to a support that his predecessors did not have, he tramples underfoot his personal enemies wherever he finds them, with an ease that no President has found,” he wrote, “on his own responsibility he takes measures that none before him would ever have dared to take; it even happens that he treats the national representation with a sort of almost insulting disdain.”
I would not be the first to compare our current — and soon to be unemployed — president to the infamous 19th-century populist. In many ways, Andrew Jackson’s election prefigured Trump’s: Both men were elected by personality more than policy, and campaigned against elitism despite their personal wealth.
More to the point now, both called foul on elections they lost (Jackson with a perhaps more legitimate grievance in 1824), had love-hate relationships with the courts, and embodied invigorated party polarization.
Modern critics of Jackson highlight the Indigenous genocide he committed, his support for slavery, and his economic policies, which were largely responsible for the Panic of 1837. But Tocqueville was more concerned with what many consider Jackson’s greatest and lasting achievements: broadened enfranchisement and public participation in democracy. Tocqueville feared the United States would become subject to a “tyranny of the majority,” and praised backstops like the Electoral College and indirect election of senators for preventing complete majority rule.
Tocqueville’s criticisms fit with his overarching fear in “Democracy in America” — which he described viscerally as a “religious terror” — of an uncontrolled social leveling, something he believed was inevitable. “So the gradual development of equality of conditions [{democracy}] is a providential fact; it has the principal characteristics of one: it is universal, it is lasting, it escapes every day from human power; all events, like all men, serve its development,” he worried.
Tocqueville’s vision of democracy, while profoundly disturbing to him, is strangely comforting to us now. He believed in democracy as a telos, as something embedded in our nation’s genetic material; he saw a march toward equality that ebbed and flowed but always moved in the same direction.
In some ways, last week’s election seems evidence of this postulate: Americans repudiated Trumpist authoritarianism with the largest popular vote total in history. Election day itself went surprisingly smoothly; record-breaking turnout in the face of a pandemic ostensibly aligns with Tocqueville’s commentary on the unmatchable democratic impulses of Americans.
But this result was anything but providence: It was the product of a lot of time and labor, particularly from local organizers and activists. And as Republican victories in both houses of Congress made clear, it was a result that could have gone the other way. Continued Senate and Electoral College disconnect from the popular vote also suggests that Tocqueville’s saving graces will be the primary drivers of tyranny in years to come.
Tocqueville was fascinated by presidential elections, which he saw as routinely destabilizing: “The President is absorbed by the care to defend himself. He no longer governs in the interest of the State, but in that of his re-election; he grovels before the majority; and often, instead of resisting its passions, as his duty requires, he runs ahead of its caprices,” he wrote. “The entire nation falls into a feverish state; the election is then the daily story of the public papers, the subject of individual conversations, the goal of all moves, the object of all thoughts, the sole interest of the moment.” This certainly feels like an apt description of the last few weeks.
But I disagree with Tocqueville’s view on the final stage of presidential elections: “It is true that as soon as fortune has decided, this ardor dissipates; everything becomes calm, and the river, once overflowing, retreats peacefully to its bed,” he wrote.
I hope, and believe, that the river will not retreat peacefully. The demands for more complete equality and representation are continuing past election day, and unlike Tocqueville, I say: Rage on.

Ah. Well. That was disgusting, right?
Over the last four years, no one escaped having to get their hands dirty, regardless of political affiliation. We’ve defended, opposed, protested, and then protested the protesting, at steadily increasing decibel levels. This election was the climax of something that long predates Trump’s presidency: Years and years of a dirty, unashamed, nasty political culture. Maybe now at the end of a truly fatiguing 2020, we can reflect back on it with some fresh eyes, see what has not been useful, and change our ways accordingly.
Democrats are chuffed at Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory, as they should be; beating an incumbent president by garnering the most votes for any candidate in U.S. history is no easy feat. Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris’ presence in her new role will be even more historic. But Democrats should be keenly aware of the fact that Donald J. Trump got the second most votes of any candidate in U.S. history. It was far from a Kumbaya around an anti-Trump fire. Nearly half the electorate loves him and or supports his policies, and that is not changing overnight.
The strategies we have been using to politically engage dissenting fellow citizens are flawed, and they’re the first thing that needs to go. America treats politics like a sports match, which is both foolish and reprehensible given the real-life impact of politics. Watch the first 30 seconds of these CNN commercials for the presidential debate — no really, go watch — and compare it to a promo for the Superbowl. See the similarities? It’s far too fitting to represent anything like a healthy political discourse. If we are going to treat politics as a contact sport, we are going to get a contact sport. We are going to get incoherent shouting matches instead of policy debates. We are going to get rivalries and diehard fans who would rather go to war than have an opposing set of ideas win an election.
If treating politics as a game allows you to use your superior debating skills to crush the entire “right” or “left” (if those terms even have a meaning anymore) under your intellectual and moral might, you may feel great. You may go watch some Tucker Carlson or Don Lemon, have a good back-patting session at the expense of the fools who believe the “un-American” things that you do not, and wonder why anyone would bother to disagree with you. I get it, it feels good. But you would have gained nothing but an inflated ego and an inaccurate understanding of the people whose votes you still need to actually get anything done.
Categorizing every Trump supporter as a threatening white supremacist will never get the support you need for Black Lives to Matter. Categorizing every Biden supporter as a socialist will never get you the support you need to Make America Great Again. It’s in your own best interest to engage productively with those who hold different political opinions. If you really want your vision for America to become a reality, and not just to be something that you shout about in an endless loop, then you are going to have to find and truly consider all the nuances of your opponent’s stance.
I am not advocating for some grand migration to the political center — far from it — good ideas start from the fringes. I do not suggest that every idea must be viewed as equal or good — damaging ideas definitely exist. I am advocating for everyone to actually communicate and discuss ideas instead of trying to demonstrate their fellow citizens’ stupidity or flawed moral character, which achieves nothing.
I will be the first person to admit that I have participated in these kinds of pointless demonstrations in the past, presenting wholesale rejections of Trump and others. I stand on no high ground. But I am 20 years old, and people my age have only known a toxic American political culture. Indeed, it’s the only politics I can remember.
I have only seen an America in chaos. I have only known an America burdened by fear of mass shootings. I have only known an America — like every other Black person — that is plagued by fear of racial injustice. I have only known a world under the imminent and existential threat of climate change. I have only known an America where all of the things I just mentioned are divisive political statements. I have only known a media ecosystem that algorithmically feeds everyone what they want to hear and what they already believe.
I am 20 years too young to be tired of literally anything yet, here I am. Exhausted.
I am no political expert — heck, I’m not even a Government concentrator. But it doesn’t take a genius to know that our current political discourse is untenable. For the sake of moving America forward and leaving toxic politics in the past, I am giving up on accepting the degradation of politics to a lowly sport. I implore you to do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Friday, Feb. 28, and you have tickets to the Harvard Wind Ensemble concert in Lowell Lecture Hall. You arrive at 7:55 p.m. and go to take your seat — there are plenty to choose from, as you’re one of only about 25 there. The band members, dressed in black dress clothes, take their seats on the center of the floor — there is no stage — and music director Mark E. Olson of the Office for the Arts comes out from the left wing and addresses the audience directly, providing some anecdotal information about the music in between pieces. The atmosphere is casual, and you notice many musicians are listed on the program as “guests”: students from other Boston schools to fill in the gaps in instrumentation from which HWE suffers. You enjoy about an hour’s worth of wind ensemble music by William Schuman, Julius Fučík, and Alan Hovhaness, among others.
An avid patron of the arts, you also attend the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra’s all-Beethoven program just forty hours later on Sunday, March 1 in Sanders Theatre. There, you immediately sense the much more formal ambience. The orchestra, now dressed in tuxedos or other evening attire, takes up the entire stage, even though some musicians don’t play until after intermission. After the student-conducted overture, music director Federico Cortese of the Music Department takes the podium, silently acknowledges the audience of 482’s applause, and turns around to give the first downbeat of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. The affair takes about two hours.
The orchestra attracted an audience nearly 20 times the size of the band. Yet the band concert was thoroughly more audience-friendly, presented some novel and underperformed works, and took place on a weekend evening. It had everything going for it, yet the performance fell on deaf ears. Why?
The Harvard Wind Ensemble and the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra are vastly different organizations that shared only one College musician between their 2019-20 rosters. The two organizations both put on at least two concerts per semester, but HRO is an 80-piece full orchestra while HWE is made up of only about 30 woodwind, brass, and percussion students. Their histories, organizational structures, and cultures couldn’t be further apart. And where HRO enjoys preeminence as Harvard’s premier music organization, HWE is relegated to small club status, which is reflected in their ticket sales and low influence on campus.
This phenomenon isn’t unique to Harvard — the subordination of the wind ensemble is universal. At high schools, colleges, competitions, summer festivals, and just about any organization that offers an orchestra and wind ensemble program, professors assign the best wind and brass players to the orchestra and the lower chairs to band; at Harvard, HRO and HWE musicians largely self-segregate. And while there are hundreds of professional orchestras in the United States that routinely produce excellent performances of Beethoven’s Fifth, the few professional wind ensembles are mostly organized by the Armed Forces; there are extremely few established civilian professional bands. College and conservatory bands, on the level of HWE, and amateur and semi-professional bands then fill the void of live wind performances and are responsible for propagating the repertoire. For example, it’s very likely that HWE’s recent performance of Lo Presti’s “Elegy for a Young American” about J.F.K., was the only one in New England this year.
All this continuously perpetuates the concept that wind ensembles offer worse quality music than orchestras and don’t deserve serious attention. A century ago, this argument might have rung true. It doesn’t anymore. Wind ensembles have changed drastically for the better, yet our overt disrespect towards their music and musicians hasn’t.
In the 21st century, there is no musical basis for the inferiority of the wind ensemble. No longer do bands just play opera selections and marches, as they mostly did before 1910. Pioneering composers slowly worked up from smaller pieces of art-music, like Gustav Holst’s First Suite in E-flat, to full symphonies for band, taking advantage of the ensemble’s unique timbres and expressive capabilities (its 20-piece reed section, compared to the orchestra’s nine, is a distinct and valuable sound, for example).
No longer is the band a discount orchestra. We now have a long lineage of great composers who focused on writing specifically for wind ensemble. Though these thinkers are frequently denigrated as “band composers,” they are in the good company of Aaron Copland, Darius Milhaud, and Arnold Schoenberg, among others, in writing serious music for band. Bands have a long history of amateur performance, of questionable musicality, and of an ineptitude for art-music, but modern wind ensembles have now fully caught up to orchestras, to the point where composers today feel comfortable writing music of equal complexity for either ensemble.
And yet the wind ensemble canon is virtually unknown to those outside the field. Wind ensemble repertoire is seldom given airtime on classical radio, few tenured musicologists study the medium, and wind ensembles face continuous difficulty in attracting audiences.
The infrastructure is already in place for the establishment of more professional wind ensembles. Most professional wind players have years of wind ensemble experience, since the band is the preferred teaching medium for middle and high schools. It would take only one professional orchestra to replace a single concert with a wind ensemble program, or a radio station to program the occasional piece, to further legitimize this music.
But in the current absence of a wide professional class of bands, college wind ensembles are the most viable lifeline in keeping the repertoire alive. Well-marketed concerts, commercial recordings, and of course, high-caliber playing are paramount for pushing the wind ensemble into the fore. If bands want to command more respect in the music world , they first have to treat themselves like professionals — at Harvard, and across the country. Then finally, the treasures of the wind ensemble repertoire will reach the wide audiences they merit, this time, no strings attached.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Academics discussed the COVID-19 pandemic’s disparate impact on Black and indigenous populations in Brazil and Mexico during a webinar hosted by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies Tuesday.
Panelists included Marcia C. de Castro, a demography professor at the School of Public Health; Alberto Diaz-Cayeros, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Center on Democracy, Development and Rule of Law; and Edward E. Telles, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine. Alisha C. Holland, a Harvard associate professor of government, moderated the event.
The pandemic disproportionately affects Black and indigenous populations in Brazil because they are more likely to work jobs that cannot happen remotely — similar to the United States — and may also have no option but to take public transportation, leading to greater COVID-19 exposure, Castro said. She added that the coronavirus mortality rate among Black, mixed-race, and indigenous people in Brazil is two times higher than that among white people, she said.
Brazil ranks third and second in the world in terms of documented COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively.
The coronavirus pandemic has magnified preexisting racial inequalities in Brazil. For example, Castro said, mother mortality rates are twice as high for Black mothers.
Castro said she believes the Brazilian health care system was positioned for an effective pandemic response; “community health agents” live in the regions they serve and know which populations are most vulnerable. However, she said, the Brazilian government did not use these resources, forcing community organizations to step up in their local areas — whether developing apps that tracked coronavirus systems for the elderly or just providing food.
“Brazil failed to use its universal health system, and failed to use what is the largest community-based primary care program in the world,” Castro said.
In his presentation on Mexico, Diaz-Cayeros noted that the COVID-19 case fatality rate for indigenous people is almost twice as high as that for other Mexican citizens — 9.8 percent compared to 5.8 percent.
Diaz-Cayeros argued that the Mexican government’s attitude toward indigenous people must change in order to support them through the pandemic. The government often argues that indigenous people have suffered more from the coronavirus because they practice traditional medicine, Diaz-Cayeros said, but there is more to the story.
“What is distinct about indigenous communities in Mexico, at least, is that they have different forms of governance, different ways in which they construct trust, that they respond publicly,” he said. “That's what we should be stressing and learning from.”
Holland said raising awareness of such health inequalities is the first step to solving the problem.
“Without attention to underlying racial and ethnic inequalities, public health authorities often reproduce or exacerbate long-standing inequalities,” Holland wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Representative Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.) encouraged students to fight for transformative, radical policies at an Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum event Tuesday.
“This is the moment to demonstrate the strength of conviction, to dig deep,” Pressley said.
Pressley, who represents the Seventh Congressional District, made history in 2018 when she was the first woman of color elected to Congress from Massachusetts. On Capitol Hill, she became a member of “the Squad”: four first-term, progessive Democratic congresswomen who have gained attention on the national stage.
Pressley spoke with Institute of Politics Fellow Brittany Packnett Cunningham — a fellow activist who moderated the talk — about the presidential victory of Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and the future of a movement that won back the White House.
The IOP event, entitled “A Conversation with Ayanna Pressley,” consisted of a discussion about the election, Pressley’s “mandate,” policy proposals, and a question-and-answer session.
Pressley credited high voter turnouts for Democratic victories, congratulating organizers and Americans for rising to the challenge of an election conducted in a polarized political climate and a pandemic.
“We met the moment with unprecedented organizing, unprecedented mobilizing,” she said. And because of that we’ve given people unprecedented hope.”
Pressley said she feels grateful, encouraged, and empowered after her re-election.
“I’m going to keep speaking truth to power because I have a mandate from my district to do exactly that,” she added.
But she also reminded the audience that the country has much more work to do.
“We have to continue to center the people. We have to continue to organize,” Pressley said. “Organizing and mobilizing and legislating our values is how we have achieved every gain throughout our society.”
While legislators should be responsive to the needs of all people, Pressley added, there need to be targeted efforts to uplift minority communities that have been disproportionately harmed by the status quo and the pandemic yet played a pivotal role in the election.
Packnett Cunningham then asked Pressley to expound briefly on her policy priorities. The representative advocated for universal healthcare, the Green New Deal, defunding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, protecting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneficiaries from deportation, re-committing to the Paris Climate Accords, and lowering the voting age to 16.
Pressley said she is driven to improve public trust in the government. She told the story of an 11-year-old girl — whose family is undocumented — forced to care for her nine-month-old brother after her mother became sick with COVID-19. After two weeks, the siblings ran out of groceries and diapers; when authorities came to check on them, the girl pretended that everything was fine, fearing their punishment rather than seeking their help.
In the concluding question-and-answer session, several students asked Pressley about the future of the Democratic Party and the progressive movement.
Pressley said legislators have a mandate to legislate according to the needs and demands of the people. She added that empathy and intersectionality are necessary for radical change, calling upon representatives to consider the stakes all of their constituents have in policy.
The representative called upon students to hold firm in their “radical imagination.”
“The power in the people has always been greater than the people in power,” she said.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, who attended the event, said the panel left her feeling “extremely energized.”
“I’m just very ready to continue seeing a change being made and continue working towards that fulfillment of working for people,” Ahuja said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren lectured on the ongoing recession at a Tuesday Zoom event co-hosted by the Institute of Politics and the Kennedy School’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government.
Rosengren said the coronavirus-driven economic crisis has wreaked extensive damage on industries disrupted by social-distancing recommendations and travel bans.
“Many service sectors including hospitality, hotels, airlines, and restaurants, and retail have all been severely impacted by the pandemic,” he said. “That shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. Services require more personal interaction.”
“As a result, those economies that are most dependent on service production, which includes most of developed Europe and the United States...have been hit by this pandemic in a more severe way,” he explained.
The pandemic is disproportionately hurting the nation’s most vulnerable populations, according to Rosengren, including young workers, women, and minorities — all of whom are overrepresented in the hard-hit service sector.
“This has implications for the long-run productivity of the U.S. economy,” he said. “Because if the women leave the workforce and don't come back, it will affect our ability to grow more rapidly as the economy does recover.”
Rosengren compared America’s response to the economic crisis with approaches pursued by peer countries.
“In the United States, much of the regulatory focus coming out of the financial crisis was stopping very large organizations from failing,” he said. “Unfortunately, I'd say, unlike much of the rest of the world, there was not nearly as much focus on how to avoid the imbalances in the economy.”
Rosengren, a Federal Open Market Committee participant, said he does commend the Federal Reserve System’s move to lower interest rates with an eye on stimulating growth.
“I'm very supportive of the low rates that we have right now,” he said. “It's completely appropriate to have very accommodative monetary policy when the unemployment rate is high.”
Rosengren said that to brace itself against unanticipated and devastating events — like a pandemic — a country can maintain adaptive fiscal policies and keep “guardrails” in place.
“No one could have anticipated a pandemic,” he said. “But we need to be prepared for whenever those shocks do occur.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As undergraduate classes pass the midpoint of a second virtual semester, department leaders within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences say they are unsure how the coronavirus will affect students’ concentration choices.
The deadline for sophomores to declare a concentration on the my.harvard online portal is November 19, though students can still switch after that date.
Within the Department of Computer Science, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies Adam C. Hesterberg said the pandemic has increased the number of students taking leaves of absence; many concentrators chose to pursue remote internships or research instead of virtual coursework.
In 2019, Economics held the lead in total undergraduate concentrators with 612, followed by Computer Science and Government at 503 and 328, respectively.
History Director of Undergraduate Studies Lisa M. McGirr noted a similar trend in her department. She said several concentrators chose to work on political campaigns during the 2020 United States election cycle.
“We have definitely had a number of leaves of absences among our juniors and seniors, and I think that it will be interesting to see in turn with the sophomores what that might mean in terms of concentration numbers,” she said.
Ruth S. Lingford, Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies, wrote in an emailed statement that the pandemic has thrown a wrench into post-graduation job market prospects, though she does not believe this will necessarily affect concentration interest.
“It is undoubtedly a difficult time in the arts at present, though there are unexpected areas of growth, such as Animation, which is having something of a boom in lockdown,” Lingford wrote. “But I think there has never been a time when students have felt a greater need to make their voices heard, to express themselves and to experience the catharsis and satisfaction of creative work.”
McGirr said that while students taking class this fall have missed the usual in-person experiences of mingling with peers and receiving word-of-mouth encouragement to take classes, she believes the department’s decision to offer timely course material has attracted a large number of students and given them a taste of the department.
“I’m thrilled that so many students are enrolled in history courses,” McGirr said. “We have a lot of courses that are thinking about topics that are really relevant to the current moment, such as looking at the pandemic or looking at institutional racism, and it seems many students have been excited by them.”
“History has never mattered more than now, and students are interested in looking to history to help find answers to things that are happening in the world today,” McGirr added.
Sophia L. Campbell ’23, who declared a concentration this fall in Human Evolutionary Biology, said the remote semester has provided some logistical benefits when it comes to deciding a course of study, such as “not having to walk really far” for advising meetings.
However, Campbell said pandemic-related pressures may have increased stress around choosing a concentration, especially for those students making a last-minute decision.
“The pandemic, the election, Zoom fatigue, where you’re living, all those are broad issues, but also the lack of social interaction because of the pandemic is a really big factor,” Campbell said. “I know a lot of people de-stress by speaking to friends or being with other people, but most of us, especially sophomores, are at home, which can make it more difficult.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 12, 2020, 4:52 p.m.
Five faculty and administrators from three Harvard schools converged to discuss the 2020 United States election’s impact on young people in a virtual panel hosted by the Graduate School of Education Tuesday.
Moderated by HGSE Professor Martin R. West, the panelists — including Harvard’s chief diversity and inclusion officer and professors from the School of Education, School of Public Health, and Kennedy School — focused on how the election results will influence national and local responses to pressing policy questions such as the coronavirus, climate change, and systemic racism.
In light of social division, HGSE Professor Meira Levinson said, expanding civic education and ensuring it is racially sensitive is critical for children nationwide.
“There just hasn’t been much of it, which is kind of bizarre given that every single child who attends American schools has civic rights and responsibilities,” she said. “That form of civic education is going to need to be one that is much more racially inclusive and transparent.”
Sherri A. Charleston, Harvard’s newly appointed chief diversity and inclusion officer, said an administration headed by President-elect Joseph R. Biden, Jr., will likely have a significant impact on higher education, particularly in the areas of Title IX, implicit bias, and the rights of veterans and those with disabilities.
She added, however, that the Trump administration has been a disruptive force on some of these issues.
“That jack is out of the box,” she said. “And there’s some question about whether we’ll ever be able to get some of the trends that we've seen unleashed, reversed.”
Kennedy School Assistant Professor of Public Policy Desmond W. Ang said incidents of police brutality and ensuing protests – significant events during this year’s presidential campaign – were not just an isolated crisis, but a moment for national reckoning.
“This is objectively something that’s just long overdue,” Ang said. “One silver lining from the past few months and the tragic death of George Floyd is that we are now having these discussions around policing and racial discrimination that has been plaguing the United States for decades, if not centuries.”
Ang added in an emailed statement following the event that police violence can have a particularly negative impact on students.
“Aggressive policing can be bad for minorities; it has detrimental educational impact, it has detrimental mental health impacts,” he said.
School of Public Health associate professor Joseph G. Allen said structural investments like improved ventilation are needed to reopen schools successfully
“Ninety percent of schools don’t meet the minimum ventilation standard,” he explained. “These investments are things we’ve been neglecting for decades.”
A Biden presidency would foster a much-needed shift toward leadership grounded in scientific evidence, Allen said in an interview following the event.
“One of the first things [Biden] announced on Saturday was the formation of his coronavirus advisory group,” Allen said. “This is a diverse group of top experts that are well respected across the entire scientific community, so it’s an immediate shift and signal that we will go back to a science-based approach.”
Allen added that an increase in cross-disciplinary problem-solving like the Tuesday discussion was one positive outcome of the COVID crisis.
“I think this is the future,” he said. “This is the power of partnerships to solve these really complex challenges. Issues like this are going to really take all of us working together.”

Students discussed prison education and its potential for combating social ills at a panel hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Tuesday afternoon.
The event, titled “Education Justice: Centering Student Voices,” is the second discussion in a two-part virtual series that explores the impact of education in carceral spaces.
Panelists at the event included Katie Medrano-Escobar, a graduate of The Loop Lab — a nonprofit dedicated to increasing job opportunities for disadvantaged communities — and Zoe L. Hopkins ’22, an organizer with the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign. Sebastian Yoon, a graduate of the Bard Prison Initiative and a program specialist at Open Society Foundations, moderated the discussion.
When asked about their educational experiences, the panelists noted lacking support systems and the “eurocentricity” of curricula, which they believe led them to develop misconceptions about United States history.
Hopkins noted the tension between Harvard’s status as a place of higher education and its role in producing “carceral logic” and upholding “legacies of white supremacy.”
“There’s this kind of double bind in the sense that I know my education is financially tied to the very thing that I am fighting to dismantle,” she said. “I came to organizing through an understanding that I couldn’t be fully proud of my degree until I knew that it was divested from systems of harm like the prison-industrial complex.”
The panelists also considered education’s potential for fostering a civically engaged and compassionate citizenry.
For Yoon, access to education while incarcerated allowed him to develop empathy and a passion for social justice.
“If you provide access to higher education to prisoners, the recidivism rate will go down,” Yoon said. He cited the substantially lower recidivism rate for graduates of the Bard Prison Initiative — only three percent — compared to the much higher national recidivism rate of 60 percent.
Medrano-Escobar discussed her own experiences participating in workforce development programs like Year Up and The Loop Lab, noting the value of non-traditional educational trajectories.
“It doesn’t just have to be that narrow path to college,” she said.
Yoon said he believes education can take many forms, not just obtaining a piece of paper that signifies one’s degree. Historically, he added, totalitarian governments have sought to restrict access to education.
“Education is frightening to those who want to suppress others,” Yoon said.
He concluded by encouraging young students to harness the power of education to fight against institutionalized oppression.
“You have that power in your hands; you’re on the right path — just continue to harness that energy,” Yoon said.

Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 and Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 said they decided to run for Undergraduate Council top brass after witnessing firsthand the ineffectiveness of Harvard student government.
“I joined the UC as a write-in candidate my sophomore year, when people were doing the ‘Abolish the UC’ movement,” Ganesh said. “And I really, really understand it.”
“Having been on the Council, I’ve seen how sometimes the way people choose to approach problems doesn’t always effectively solve them,” she added.
Ganesh and Brennan believe their extensive experience on the Undergraduate Council — warts and all — makes them ideal candidates for UC President and Vice President.
Their campaign is centered on the premise that Harvard students “deserve more than just promises,” according to the duo’s website. The platform focuses on three pillars: social justice, academics, and pandemic plans.
Ganesh, a junior in Eliot House from Bowling Green, Ky., is concentrating in Statistics. She currently serves as the chair of the UC Finance Committee. Brennan, a sophomore in Winthrop House from South Glens Falls, N.Y., is concentrating in Physics. He is secretary of the UC. Both Ganesh and Brennan serve on the UC Executive Board.
Brennan said the UC can improve its efficiency by pursuing institutional overhaul instead of temporary fixes.
“I think it’s clear from the calls that we hear from students at Harvard that the big changes that we need are structural ones,” he said.
Ganesh and Brennan said that as a ticket spanning the sophomore and junior classes, they can better serve the needs of all undergraduates.
As a sophomore who missed out on some traditional first-year experiences due to COVID-19, Brennan said he is prepared to effectively represent current freshmen.
“As a sophomore and a proud member of the Class of 2023, I know what it’s like to be shuttered from Annenberg, to be kicked out of my dorm in Matthews, and to have learned my housing assignment through a screen,” Brennan said.
“I am running on this ticket with Mini to represent the students who have had unconventional experiences at Harvard, to represent the first-years who are in unconventional circumstances, and to represent the sophomores who have been denied their first year,” he added.
Ganesh said that by virtue of class standing, Brennan can relate to freshmen and sophomores in a way that she cannot, as she had the opportunity to experience hallowed Harvard traditions and build on-campus connections throughout her first two years.
“If it’s not your lived experience, then it won’t be easy to immediately tell what’s going on and what needs to be done,” Ganesh said.
Ganesh and Brennan are centering their campaign around social justice, including advocacy for a new Ethnic Studies concentration.
“I want to make that a priority because it is very important to have, especially in this age of reckoning,” she said. “In this national moment, it does not make sense for Harvard not to have Ethnic Studies as a concentration.”
Ganesh said she supported the creation of a physical space dedicated to cultural and religious groups. Students at the College have advocated for such a multicultural center for decades. She said her experience in Dharma — the Hindu students’ association at Harvard — illustrates its importance.
“Our religious space is quite literally a basement in Canaday B and it leaks in the winter,” she said. “To put minority student groups in leaking basements is just completely untenable. Physical space is kind of a metaphor for what’s important.”
Ganesh and Brennan also propose restructuring the Harvard University Police Department. They believe that it is important to establish HUPD as “one department amongst others.”
“I think that creating a Department of Campus Safety, in which HUPD is a subdepartment, would free up money and funding to go toward things like mental health and sexual assault protection,” she said.
The candidates said they were disappointed by the UC’s recent initiatives to support mental health; in the spring, the body allocated $7,200 for subscriptions to the meditation app Headspace.
“The solution is not Headspace,” Ganesh said. “Students have been telling us for several months that they aren’t using it, and even if they are using it, it’s not helping.”
Ganesh said she and Brennan would strive to allocate money to improving counseling resources on campus, both through Harvard University Health Services and peer-run support groups.
“Actual solutions to mental health include using money from the restructuring of HUPD to hire a diverse cast of counselors, so students can approach someone who understands their lived situation,” she said. “We also want to supplement peer counseling groups to address this issue.”
Brennan and Ganesh said they built their platform through conversations with members of the student body.
“Most of our platform and ideas are built up with conversations with the students that they would affect,” Brennan said. “The purpose of that is to ensure that we’re not conceiving of a problem that we think is there and are trying to solve that.”
The candidates noted that in their experience, the UC often establishes and passes new bills and ideas with immense support from the executive board; however, they say, these well-intentioned initiatives are not representative of student voices and do not address actual student concerns.
They hope to rectify this by improving transparency and prioritizing direct communication with constituents — efforts Brennan says he has spearheaded while establishing the UC Communications Committee and compiling weekly updates for the student body as UC Secretary.
Ganesh and Brennan also plan to create a UC Advocacy Caucus focused on social justice projects and driven by the priorities of their peers.
“We’ve already started doing this actually,” Ganesh said. “The Advocacy Caucus would be a group of UC members who are dedicated to reaching out to the student body and figuring out what their social justice needs are and to advocate for them.”
Ganesh said that the UC currently relies heavily on dedicated students to come forward and push the council toward fighting for their cause.
“We shouldn’t be forcing students to advocate on their own and eventually come to us,” Ganesh said. “We should be with them, on the ground, from day one, working in tandem with them to get something done.”
Ever since they joined the Undergraduate Council as freshmen, Noah A. Harris ’22 and Jenny Y. Gan ’22 have worked as a pair.
A transport program for students’ non-emergency trips to local hospitals marked the first of many UC collaborations for Harris and Gan. Gan would check a student’s reimbursement form every two weeks; Harris would then reimburse them via Venmo.
Now, Harris and Gan are running to serve as the Council’s president and vice president on a platform of “Building Tomorrow’s Harvard” through initiatives addressing diversity and inclusion, student life, and health and wellness.
Harris, a Government concentrator and a junior in Dunster House, currently co-chairs the Council’s Black Caucus and serves as UC Treasurer. A junior studying Neuroscience in Leverett House, Gan has served as First Year Class Committee Chair and Student-Faculty Committee Director.
The pair argues that experience on the Council and actionable proposals make them uniquely qualified for the job.
“We've been able to execute for students and so students know what they're able to get,” Harris said. “We not only have the most experience, but it's good experience, because we've been doing the work.”
If elected, Harris and Gan said, they would seek to hold Harvard accountable for its commitment to anti-racism, diversity, and inclusion, which Harris said the University had “not been living up to.” On their campaign website, the pair detailed a number of virtual and in-person initiatives aimed at that goal.
Harris and Gan proposed an Advocacy Fund, which would help fund student activists who may incur a financial burden from protesting and organizing as they pay for food, travel, megaphones, paint, and the like.
“We want to make sure student activists are supported,” Gan said.
The pair also hopes to establish the One Harvard Fund, which they envision as a yearlong fundraising initiative for the student body. Under the system, undergraduates would vote on a charitable organization to receive their collective donations.
Gan said the One Harvard Fund would build off a Council fundraiser Harris spearheaded last spring, which raised over $46,000 for organizations furthering the Black Lives Matter movement.
The pair also aims to foster dialogue about intersectionality by granting affinity groups up to $500 to plan joint virtual events.
Apart from these new initiatives, Harris and Gan plan to expand the Peer to Peer Mentorship Program — originally launched by Gan. The program funds and promotes mentorship programs within student organizations and affinity groups, which the candidates said are crucial to building connections between upperclassmen and freshmen studying from home.
Harris and Han also advocated for some in-person initiatives, including the creation of a multicultural center and a first-year social space. They said both goals may not be realistic goals during a mostly virtual school year, but still hoped to push for these spaces — the former of which students have argued for since the 1960s.
Gan said she and Harris hope to “continue laying the groundwork” for both.
Harris said he envisions creating an engaging virtual campus community that “more resembles the in-person one.”
The pair plans to expand a recently enacted pilot partnership between Lyft and the UC that provides transportation to essential services, including hospital appointments and COVID-19 testing. The initiative would also supplement shuttle services to improve night safety for students on campus.
“It makes essential services way more accessible and affordable for students,” said Gan. “And we’re hoping to expand it in the spring to include more students, more funding.”
Harris and Gan hope also to partner with a telecommunications company to subsidize Internet services for students taking virtual classes with spotty Wi-Fi.
For undergraduates living on campus, Harris and Gan said they will work to expand cheap and flexible spring and summer storage as an alternative to existing options like Olympia Moving and Storing, the center of recent frustration. The Council recently rolled out its storage program, Gan said, a program the pair would continue into their term.
As a third plank, Harris and Gan said that they want to support an undergraduate community struggling with mental health and sexual assault.
The pair has proposed adding mental health questions to the daily check-ins students living on campus must complete. Gan said that while Harvard has successfully promoted physical wellness during the pandemic, she and Harris want to provide students with easy access to mental health resources.
“Our goal is to create a space where students can check in with their mental health, as much as they feel comfortable, and providing resources,” Gan said. “So the same resources that are provided for physical health reasons — for COVID — for mental health.”
They also plan to advocate a sexual assault prevention policy that elevates the work of student activists, push for an increases in staff and funding at the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and call on Harvard to adopt an affirmative consent standard.
The pair said the sexual assault prevention policy they propose would extend to male-dominated social groups.
“Making sure that they are held accountable for the actions of their members, for creating a safe environment for everybody, and also for advocating for survivors — that’s the job of leaders of the UC, student activists, and social groups, on creating that environment,” Gan said.
Harris and Gan also have plans for in-person students: providing free drug-testing chips for drinks, dispensing safe-sex supplies through a health and wellness vending machine, and expanding a pilot program that offers free and accessible disposable hygiene products.
Harris and Gan said the role of Council’s president and vice president in a virtual environment is to “fill gaps” in the student experience — especially for those students studying from home.
“We really just want to make sure that students are able to have what they need, because they're not as engaged in their clubs or in the social experience at Harvard,” Harris said.
They also said the Council should serve as a liaison between students and administrators during a virtual school year. Harris said that he hopes to establish connections with the administration via twice-semesterly meetings with University President Lawrence S. Bacow and monthly meetings with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
Harris said he and Gan hope to invite students to these meetings so they can air their concerns when Harvard is “out of step.”
The pair also wants to connect with students themselves, Gan added. They plan to hold open office hours and send biweekly communications detailing virtual events, the UC’s work, and programs and subsidies for which students may be eligible.
“Now it's not as much word of mouth, it's email,” Gan said. “They’re all virtual; that's so different than what it used to be.”
Harris and Gan said Harvard undergraduates need strong and experienced leadership for a school year like no other.
“We have the experience to get things done and we have the ability to do those things,” Harris said. “But we also are willing to meet this moment and to be the leaders that you need during this unprecedented time.”

Dear Lowell House Dish Return,
The other day, someone in our apartment building broke a glass dish, and a strong feeling rose up inside of me. It was for you, and I felt so full of love and affection that I just had to express my emotions. You have been one of the most infuriating aspects of my college life, but also one that has brought me immense joy. Even on days when I ate my meals alone, it didn’t feel that way, because you were there with me. Amidst all the chaos of Harvard, you were a constant in my life.
I have to admit, I didn’t like you much at first. The sound of glassware smashing reminds me of my childhood, when I was the clumsy one who got in trouble for breaking things. Of course this wasn’t your fault — students didn’t understand how you functioned or were too distracted to place their dishes on a tray. The dhall employees got anxious, and one employee always stood, watching over you to make sure students handled you properly. Students feared you too — why else would they stack plates underneath their beds?
However, as the fall semester progressed, as I got more exhausted, it was no longer an option to breakfast early and avoid hearing you. Slowly, I got used to you, and as more Lowellians learned about your needs, there were fewer shattering sounds. It was always pretty obvious when someone from outside of Lowell came to dine here — they were unfamiliar with your ways. While I don’t condone violence, the less frequent sounds of breaking glass started making me laugh. When I shared meals with friends in other houses, I would always rearrange my silverware appropriately even when there was no need. What can I say? You grew on me.
You were all the most beautiful aspect of Lowell dhall (those fancy chandeliers have got nothing on you). You were so sensitive (to silverware not removed from plates and bowls) and were perhaps too good for the world of coronavirus, which has silenced you. Sometimes when I wash dishes in my sister’s apartment, I still hear your gentle whir and the chinks of the glass dishes being carried underground to the dish room, and I know that you live on, inside of me. I wonder if I shall ever see you again, but I dream of the day, because it will be the same day it will be safe for students to be back on campus, eating off of dhall glassware, when they will break dishes and blame it on you.
With (probably unreciprocated) love,
A fellow Lowellian
