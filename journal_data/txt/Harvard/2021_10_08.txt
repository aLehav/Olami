After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A concentration is to a major as a final club is to a fraternity. A controversial take, maybe, but give me the chance to explain.
We are deep into punch season at Harvard, a season known for its divisiveness and exclusivity, but also its mystery and excitement, engaging sophomores (and this year, juniors) in a under-the-radar, “who do you know” competition straight out of the Social Network. Questions like “What are you doing tonight?” or “Where are you going this weekend?'' take on even more intense “connectivity” connotations than the already networking-heavy party scene at Harvard. Punch events happen at random and are unbeknownst to those not invited, so those who are “in the know” use these questions to probe the general population to see who runs in the same circles.
Before I came to campus, final clubs were an enigma. To outsiders, these clubs are painted with the ambiguity, intrigue, and antiquity of a National Treasure plot. All I knew is that they had to be different from the fraternities that dot the landscape of universities and colleges in the South. They had to be, right? It was Harvard, after all. Certainly the “frat guy” stereotype was a strictly Southern thing, inapplicable in the Northeast.
Fraternities and sororities, especially those in the South, also have a very distinct reputation. From images of huge houses boasting large white columns and Greek letters, to viral #BamaRush Tik Toks, to an intense “rush” process, Greek life in the South is a fundamental aspect of college life. Many find their closest friends within sororities and fraternities, and upon graduating, turn to their Greek-letter organizations for connections.
To many, final clubs at Harvard and Greek life in the South appear very different, but replace the cryptic “punch” process with the opt-in process of “rushing” and you arrive at very similar entities: Social organizations that throw a lot of parties have a huge hold on college social life and operate in varying degrees of exclusivity. Both systems are known for being the center of social life for college students, and both have a history of restricting who is allowed to attend parties and events. And, while the rush process of Greek life is not as exclusive as the punch process of final clubs (where you must be sought out or invited by a friend), Greek life chapters are actively ranked on their appeal, much like final clubs, and admittance into “top tier” houses is also characterized largely by who you know and to whom you are connected.
Oh, and also, the only male final club that did not originally begin as a local chapter of a national college fraternity is the Porcellian.
The purposes of these organizations are largely the same. The Venn-Diagram of stereotypical “frat guy” behavior and “final club guy” behavior could very well be a circle, and this should not necessarily come as a surprise. We all are college students, so our behavior, regardless of institution, is not going to have too great a standard deviation. College students want to have a social life, and a social life in college largely revolves around parties, which Greek life and final clubs provide.
So why the insane exclusivity of final clubs if fundamentally, they really are not much different than fraternities?
The reason is that exclusivity is Harvard's favorite pastime.
Harvard students started their college experience with the narcotic taste of “making the cut” — of being part of the roughly 5 percent of applicants accepted into one of the most prestigious universities in the nation. And after being included in the exclusive, all we want is more.
It’s why extracurriculars have such insane comp and application processes, even though nearly every single applicant is qualified. It’s why final clubs have to seek you out, not the other way around. It’s why certain upperclassmen houses are desired more than others, why final clubs do not let everyone into parties. It’s why Patagonias from finance clubs on campus are seen as the identifier of future occupational success, and the process of admittance into said clubs is akin to a job application. We are obsessed with exclusivity, with status, and with being part of something that others are rejected from, because the one big factor that distinguishes us from others at home (the fact that we go to Harvard) does not work when everyone else also goes to Harvard. We have manufactured our own “Ivy League” within these hallowed halls.
Final clubs just scratch the surface of exclusivity at Harvard. The problem with making final clubs the sacrificial lamb in our conversations on Harvard exclusivity is that this lets all other manifestations of our hypercompetitiveness slither under the radar.
Humans are hardwired to enjoy the feeling of being wanted, and that is what exclusivity within Harvard’s web of clubs and organizations and arbitrary status symbols offers — the feeling of being wanted when not everyone else is allowed to be.
Frats in the South are more similar to Harvard final clubs than many would like to admit. The only significant difference is Harvard's toxic addiction to exclusivity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I briefly found myself alone in my common room, admiring the bright moon from the window. With my half-eaten mooncake and cool glass of grapefruit soda, I didn’t feel lonely at all. It was oddly poetic, almost like a verse from Li Bai’s poems — “facing my shadow, together we make three.”
In my brief 19 years of living, I’ve noticed that there is such a deep-seated fear of appearing alone in public. This is perhaps even more present on college campuses such as ours: eating in dining halls, walking to classes, attending any sort of social events. No one wants to be seen by themselves. Being alone during your first few days on campus is sometimes unavoidable, but after that, you can’t help feeling a bit like a loser if you still don’t have company.
It’s completely understandable. After my freshman year on Zoom, being on a campus full of life and people has been amazing so far. There are no two ways about it — the opportunities to finally socialize with people and forge genuine connections have kept my spirits high.
Perhaps I am finally getting the genuine college student experience that makes American higher education so alluring: to be afforded the privilege of making as many communities as I want, as big or small as I want them, and to never feel truly alone as I enter a new stage of my life. Yet, I find myself wanting to spend more time with myself — alone — amidst all that is happening.
This desire is more than me being an introvert, my social battery running low, or just needing time away from people to recharge. My selective solitude feels a bit more positive: a desire to define my own company not in the absence of others but in the fullness of just myself.
I hope this does not come off as narcissistic or me thinking I’m too good to be around others: I love being on campus surrounded by people. The light breeze of joy I feel when walking through the Yard filled with people is simply unmatched. The opportunities to interact with and learn from my peers and professors have, by far, been one of the most valuable things Harvard has given me thus far. Well, apart from the prime real estate location my dorm is in. Or my financial aid. Or the dining hall ice-cream machines — anyhow, you get the point.
Nonetheless, there is something so deeply satisfying about exploring campus and the surrounding areas, or even this new stage of life, all by myself. Just like how much I’ve loved getting to know my peers, I also want to know myself a little more and a little better as I navigate this new environment and stage in life. Like tracking the phases of the moon, I want to see my own changes.
I take myself out for a coffee chat, for a nice meal, for a solo movie viewing experience. I give myself the same time of day and quality time I am willing to give others. The walk by the Charles doesn’t become any less refreshing just because I am walking by myself. The dining hall doesn’t become more foreign or intimidating when I am alone.
We are not somehow weaker when we are only in our own presence.
“Community” has become a buzzword on Harvard’s campus — we’ve seen it in countless emails, we’ve heard it in speeches and brief pitches for extracurricular activities. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with valuing communities and actively building them. But the community starts from the individual. Without ourselves, we are nothing. The world is confusing and constantly changing, so maybe I can’t ever understand the world if I don’t begin by understanding myself.
But I am constantly changing, too. And you probably are, too.
The sheer number of students at Harvard and the College’s formal emphasis on community on campus constantly remind us that we are never alone.
But sometimes, we just are alone — and there’s nothing wrong with being alone. This autumn, while the weather is still nice and the moon is still bright, go be your own best companion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As of this month, college football players are university workers — at least if you ask the federal government. Last week, the General Counsel for the National Labor Relations Board issued a memorandum stating that college athletes should be considered employees and afforded the same protections as any other worker. According to the memo, the very term “student-athletes” is a mischaracterization of the nature of their employment.
This federal memo gets a lot right. The dynamics between college athletes and the schools they play for, which often profit immensely off them, are rife with examples of exploitation. This relationship just doesn't exist at Harvard, where aid is completely untethered to athletics and the term “student-athletes” fits.
The memo represents a seismic shift in how the federal government views student-athletes. After a years-long battle, a landmark 2021 Supreme Court decision opened the floodgates for increased athlete protections when it ruled that the NCAA can’t preclude athletes from accessing college staples, like study-abroad programs and paid internships. The ruling provoked the question — what else might we be depriving college athletes of? — and provided the legal standing to challenge long-standing power dynamics.
As a board, we have generally been supportive of expanding the rights of college athletes. When the NCAA allowed athletes to, in essence, sign brand deals, we saw the move as a belated recognition of athletes’ “basic economic right” to profit off their image; something they certainly shouldn’t miss out on because they play sports.
This federal memo wrestles with a far more significant question: Are college athletes employees?
Depends where you look. On campuses where college sports are major cash cows (think the University of Alabama) and those where an athlete must play to keep their financial aid, the answer is clearly yes. At most colleges, a set number of full scholarships are earmarked for athletes playing Division 1 “headcount sports” — those that generally rake in revenue, like football, basketball, and volleyball. The promise of social mobility is a major factor that pushes students to pursue athletics and undergo recruitment with schools that offer athletes full rides. Harvard, where aid has nothing to do with a student’s athleticism, is a notable exception.
On such campuses, athlete recruitment is akin to a formal hiring process. College athletes perform a fundamentally economic service for their institution as the foot soldiers in the $1 billion industry that is college sports. College coaches and NCAA statues exert incredible control over an athlete's quality of life. We struggle to see much of a difference between the strict practice schedules college athletes must comply with and the hours say, a waitress, is subject to, besides the fact that athletes have no say in what “shifts” they work and labor protections more strictly regulate the service industry. And, rather than the prospect of getting fired looming over their heads, college athletes with full academic scholarships contingent on their athletic output risk ending their education should they get injured or simply decide to quit.
In classifying collegiate athletes as employees, the NLRB memo opens the door to unionization and other forms of labor action. In 2016, Northwestern’s football team, led by its star quarterback, attempted to unionize, arguing that when athletes put in 40 hours a week and only graduate half the time, painting them as just students is disingenuous. Though the NLRB shot them down then, this new memo makes that outcome unlikely going forward. Now, unionization presents a promising path to improving the labor conditions college athletes play, train, and learn in.
However, unionization doesn’t quite fit at Harvard. To call the athletic landscape here unique would be an understatement. For one, we have 42 varsity teams (some more niche and high-brow, like water polo and fencing), making us the school with the most Division I programs in the country. The Harvard athletic department also breaks exactly even, meaning our teams aren’t exactly an exploited source of wealth for the school.
Most significantly, our generous financial aid program is not at all tied to athletics, meaning students here don’t have to choose between staying in a sport they don’t enjoy and keeping their scholarships and quitting (perhaps to invest more heavily in other aspects of college life) at the cost of being priced out of their education. That might explain why over one in every four students who played on our varsity teams during college quit by their senior year; an option many athletes at other universities can’t even fathom.
At Harvard, the college goes out of its way to clarify that its athletes are students first, and athletes if they want to be. Former Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise compared an athlete quitting their sport to a student changing their concentration. In its mission statement, the Athletics Department clarifies that athletes “are held to the same standards as every other Harvard student.” This is a far cry from other universities, where some athletes, shockingly, graduate illiterate — passed through class after class for winning games, tragically deprived of an education.
On our campus, where the term student-athlete truly fits, athlete organizing makes more sense in the form of student groups, such as the Women of Harvard Athletics and the Harvard Athletics Black Varsity Association, that work to build community and enhance the student-athlete experience at Harvard.
The fact that unionization doesn’t make sense at Harvard does not blunt this NLRB memo's positive impact. For too long, college athletics has taken advantage of its players — proudly selling star players’ jerseys while they themselves go hungry; stripping them of scholarships if they become too injured to play. We’re hopeful that the federal government’s recognition of the labor inherent in collegiate athletics paves the way for a long-overdue improvement in how colleges treat athletes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Palestinian politician ​​Hanan Ashrawi spoke about the ongoing effort to broker an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at a virtual event hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center Thursday.
Ashrawi — an eminent Palestinian politician, lawmaker, and activist — made history as the first woman elected to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in 2009. She was re-elected in 2018 and served as the PLO’s official spokesperson until 2020.
Moderated by Middle East Initiative Faculty Director and International Relations professor Tarek Masoud, Thursday's conversation took place roughly five months after the latest flashpoint of violence in the Israel-Palestine region that lasted 11 days. In May, Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, fired rockets into Israel after Israeli police raided a mosque in Jerusalem. Israel responded by bombing targets in Gaza.
Masoud began the conversation by asking Ashrawi to respond to claims about Palestine “inhibiting the prospects of self-determination,” citing denied peace agreements at Camp David in 2000 and Ehud Olmert’s rejected peace deal in 2008.
“If you look at the fact there was never a single peace proposal that could meet the minimum requirements of the sovereignty and territorial integrity and territorial contiguity,” Ashrawi argued. “These were all ways of trying to find ways around the conflict, even when they talk about Camp David.”
“If [Palestinians] were free, if we were in control, if we were equal, if we have equal rights, and so on, then we would take over the peace process, and we would see it to its end,” she added.
Masoud asked Ashrawi to comment on the shortcomings of the Oslo Accords, a pair of diplomatic agreements reached by the Israeli government and the PLO in the 1990s.
Ashrawi said she believes those who negotiated the deal were not “fully aware of all the issues.”
“By pushing aside all the real issues, particularly the occupation and lack of freedom and lack of rights, and by refusing to deal with the core issues and the root causes, including the issue of the refugees, all these things were postponed without any guarantees,” Ashrawi said.
“Without any kind of protection for the Palestinians who were under occupation, we continue to negotiate under occupation while Israel was not held to account in any way,” she added.
Ashrawi said in an interview that she hopes attendees gained a greater understanding of “the Palestinian narrative and the Palestinian reality” from the event.
“I want you to know — and I know many people already know — to think collectively of ways in which we can cooperate to find solutions, and not just to continue to lay blame or continue to expect the Palestinians to bear the burden or the brunt of the situation,” Ashrawi said.
Ashrawi added that she expected the event to receive some pushback since controversy is “always part of any academic institution.”
“The moment you start thinking critically and the moment you’re there to speak out, particularly on the Palestinian question that has been excluded from the public discourse in the States for a long time, I think you will get some pushback,” Ashrawi said. “But this is changing.”
She said she believes institutions like Harvard are important in shaping perceptions, attitudes, and leadership.
“Once [people] are exposed to different narratives, once they’re exposed to the truth and the reality of the Palestinian identity, I think it will make a difference,” she said. “You cannot learn everything but at least you can learn new things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Representative Hakeem S. Jeffries (D-N.Y.) discussed how Democrats are handling pressing political issues with their majorities in both houses of Congress at the Institute of Politics Thursday.
Moderated by Arjun A. Akwei ’24 and Nia S. Warren ’24, the discussion explored Jeffries’ position on the proposed $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, police reform legislation, and voter suppression.
The forum followed a series of public disputes between progressive and moderate Democrats regarding the party’s proposed reconciliation package, which aims to expand the social safety net and tackle climate change.
When asked about how different sects of the Democratic party are handling their disparate viewpoints, Jeffries explained that there has been some “turbulence.”
“As we're working through these big issues, we have a narrow majority. So of course, there's going to be turbulence,” said Jeffries, who serves as chair of the House Democratic Caucus. “There was turbulence when FDR tried to get social security passed with those extraordinary numbers, so certainly there will be turbulence now.”
Despite the in-fighting occurring within the Democratic Party, Jeffries maintained that the party remains a “coalition.”
“We embrace the fact that there's a broad ideological diversity, as well as racial diversity, gender, sexual orientation, religious, life experiences, and region. I think that's what makes House Democrats the most authentic representative of the American people in the institution,” Jeffries said.
Jeffries, who formerly served as Whip of the Congressional Black Caucus, also discussed police reform, sharing that his experiences raising his Black sons gave him a “sense of urgency” on the issue.
“Make sure you take identification with you because if you get stuck and you don't have identification, it could be problematic,” Jeffries said, referring to the warnings he gave to his children. “If the police get aggressive with you, don’t disrespect them. You can't fight that battle on the street.”
Despite deep divisions in the current political climate, Jeffries said he hopes recent progress on criminal justice reform, which he called “bipartisan in nature,” can lead to “common ground” on police reform in the near future.
Pointing to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, Jeffries also emphasized the “fragility” of U.S. democracy.
“Far too many people in its aftermath ran further away from democracy, and in part, doubled and tripled down on voter suppression in state after state across the country,” Jeffries said.
“The urgency of dealing with protecting our democracy and the right to vote, which is so central to the integrity of our government — one person one vote, regardless of race, regardless of zip code,” he added.
Democrats have proposed two voting rights bills, both of which have passed in the House. Jeffries said he hopes the Senate will “turn aggressively” toward passing the proposals.
“We're going to have to get these bills over the finish line one way or the other,” Jeffries said.
In spite of the challenges that congressional Democrats face, Jeffries said he remains confident in their ability to pass the party's agenda.
“We remain resolute that failure is not an option in any of these areas and certainly is not an option as it relates to our democracy,” Jeffries said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin discussed the role of women in modern electoral politics at a virtual event hosted by the Radcliffe Institute on Thursday.
The event — entitled “American Women and the Ongoing Battle to Save Democracy” — included prepared remarks from Rubin and a discussion moderated by Michel M. Martin ’80, the weekend host of NPR’s All Things Considered.
Rubin discussed the double standards she said female candidates faced in the 2020 presidential election by drawing a comparison between U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and billionaire Tom Steyer.
“You had someone like Elizabeth Warren who had a stack of white papers,” Rubin said in reference to Warren’s experience. “Then you had people like Tom Steyer, who was a billionaire, who had never run for anything.”
“You had this huge disparity, and yet the refrain of who was risky and who was not risky remained in gender terms,” Rubin added.
Despite this difference, she noted the large role women played on Biden's campaign and continue to play in his administration.
“I also look at how Joe Biden ran his race — how he won and what he’s doing now,” Rubin said. “He had a large number of women who worked on his campaign, including his campaign chief, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, now a deputy chief of staff in the White House.”
Rubin said the history of women's role in politics inspired her book "Resistance: How Women Saved Democracy from Donald Trump."
“I wanted to show not only how women were participating and making change, but how women were reinventing their own lives in meaningful ways — not because they were interested in self-promotion, not because they wanted the fame of politics, but because they felt like they had reached a crisis point in American democracy,” Rubin said.
Rubin also discussed her decision to leave the Republican party following Trump's election in 2016.
“Right around the time that it became clear that the nomination would not be taken from him,” Rubin said about Trump’s 2016 campaign. “I said, OK, I gotta be out of here. I cannot be a part of a movement that would embrace someone who is so openly misogynistic. So openly racist. So openly xenophobic.”
“It was a tremendous change of perspective,” Rubin added. “In many ways it was somewhat head spinning that suddenly the people who used to be on the other side are now on your side.”
Rubin closed the event by appealing to audience members to engage in politics to strengthen American democracy.
“It requires still that we have all hands on deck,” she said. “You have to engage yourself, your neighbors. You have to vote in those local elections, and the off-year elections, and the midterm elections.”

Harvard affiliates and Cambridge art lovers are eagerly visiting the Harvard Art Museums, which reopened in early September, nearly 18 months after shutting their doors due to the coronavirus pandemic.
After opening to Harvard affiliates on Sept. 1, Harvard’s three art museums — The Fogg Museum, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum — invited the general public back to their galleries on Sept. 4.
“It’s been very sad not to have the students in the space, because they animate the space,” HAM director Martha Tedeschi said. “They’re a big part of why we’re here and of our legacy as a teaching museum, so it was super exciting to have the first students come in.
The museums have made several changes as the gallery reopens. Admission is now free for the general public on Sundays, part of an attempt to increase museum accessibility to non-Harvard affiliates.
Tedeschi said the program was immediately popular, and sold out during its first week.
Although the museum’s doors are open for visitors, the gift shop, like several other Square businesses, is struggling with a national labor shortage and remains closed. The museum’s cafe has likewise not reopened due to health concerns.
Tedeschi said the museums have decided to prioritize their educational services over staffing common spaces like the cafés.
“If coffee and the shop have to come a little bit later, that's the way it's gonna have to be,” Tedeschi said.
Students and professors said they were thrilled to be able to return and examine the artwork up close.
Joseph Koerner, a professor of History of Art and Architecture, said observing the artwork he studies in person is “always a revelation.” He noted that viewers often miss important artistic details if they only view art online.
“If you go to the museum, and see it again, you might say, 'oh, my God, I never knew! I thought it was much bigger than that or much smaller, or less glossy or dark',” Koerner said.
David J. Roxburgh, the chair of the department of History of Art and Architecture, also noted the value of viewing art up close in person.
“There's nothing that can substitute for direct access to the collection,” Roxburgh said.
Adam T. Sella ‘22, a tour guide for the art museums, said the experience of being back in person far exceeds the socially-distant Zoom events.
“It is great to be in the museum to actually get to see the work, to talk to people, and to have other people see the art itself, rather than an image of the art on Zoom,” Sella said.
The museums currently have several new exhibitions that launched with the reopening. “Devour The Land” is a collection of nearly 160 photographs highlighting the environmental damage caused by the U.S. military, a topic that Tedeschi argued has not received sufficient attention in the art world.
“An issue that's been written about, but has not been dealt with by the arts, is that the American military is the biggest polluter in the United States,” she said. “And that sometimes that pollution is really under the surface but manifests in the illnesses of communities.”
Linda Greer, an environmental activist, visited Harvard from Washington, D.C. with the sole purpose of viewing “Devour The Land.” She said she hopes all Harvard students will stop by before it closes on Jan. 16, 2022.
“I really think that they might have to spend two visits, because it is a lot to take in,” she said. “It is really well worth some time.”
Tedeschi recommended students visit the art galleries to unwind.
“Using the experience to hone your powers of observation a little bit while relaxing your body can be really helpful,” she said. “Some people might go to a yoga class, other people might go to the museum.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in a Thursday interview that the FAS is continuing its cluster hire of ethnic studies scholars and will “probably” update affiliates on its progress by the semester’s end.
After decades of pressure from students and alumni advocating for an ethnic studies concentration, Gay announced in June 2019 that the FAS would hire three to four senior faculty in Asian American, Latinx, and Muslim studies by the end of the 2019-2020 academic year, a first step in establishing a formal program in ethnic studies at Harvard.
At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, Gay informed the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition — a student and alumni advocacy group pushing for an ethnic studies program — that the FAS had indefinitely suspended the faculty search due to logistical issues posed by the public health crisis. The search resumed in August 2020.
In the Thursday interview, Gay confirmed that “the cluster hire continues to move forward.”
“I hope to actually have an update by the end of the calendar year and probably by the end of the semester,” she said.
Despite the delay from her original timeline, Gay said she is “very excited about how that search is proceeding.”
“We are fully committed in the FAS — and I’m personally committed to — expanding the representation of this important field of study that is ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration on our campus, and to providing a robust curriculum and an exciting environment for scholars and students who are passionate about this topic,” Gay said.
Gay declined to comment, however, on the future of Latinx studies within the FAS. Earlier this year, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences suspended admission to the secondary program in Latinx Studies for the 2021-2022 academic year.
During the interview, Gay also shared her excitement and gratitude for the “incredible and unprecedented" $45 million gift from alumni to expand Asian American studies at Harvard. The donation, announced last month, will endow new professorships and graduate fellowships and fund academic research in the field.
“Importantly, it was also something that will enable us to recruit preeminent scholars and convene a thriving intellectual community of faculty and graduate students and undergraduates to collaborate and innovate,” Gay said.
Gay declined to comment on how the Asian American studies donation relates to a potential formal concentration in ethnic studies.
Alongside ethnic studies advocacy, the FAS has come under scrutiny for how its tenure processes treat scholars of color. Following the high-profile tenure denial of Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña, more than 100 faculty demanded the school review its tenure procedures.
Per Gay, a committee formed following those demands has begun “finalizing its report, with a view to sharing it with the Faculty in the coming weeks.”
Gay said Thursday the FAS continues “to make good progress in advancing the racial justice agenda” set in place during the summer of 2020. She specifically commended the contributions of the inaugural Associate Dean of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, Sheree Ohen, including the DIB Graduate Student Fellows Program Ohen piloted last spring.
Gay also lauded the $100 million gift to the Economics Department from former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny S. Pritzker ’81.
The new Economics building funded by Pritzker’s gift will be located in the main Cambridge campus near the Littauer Center for Public Administration, the department’s current home, Gay said.
“It really is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and it comes actually at a moment of significant possibility and promise for Economics at Harvard,” Gay said. “With the support of this gift, the Econ department is poised to enter a whole new era of groundbreaking impact.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council candidates discussed strategies for federal funding allocation, employment opportunities, and city-wide safety in a virtual forum Thursday evening.
Several candidates shared strategies to democratize access to housing and employment to bridge the gap between poorer and wealthier subsets of the city’s population. Cambridge’s top quintile earns an average annual salary of $343,000, while its bottom quintile earns an average of $13,000, per a report released by the Cambridge Community Foundation in April.
Second time candidate Burhan Azeem said he believes it is important that the City allocate Covid-19 federal funding to residents undergoing difficult transitions, such as those facing evictions. He added that those residents have less representation in local government, while arguing that wealthier residents receive a disproportionate degree of visibility.
Challenger Joe McGuirk noted the rapid loss of low and middle-income residents from Cambridge, citing mobile housing vouchers as a means of preserving socioeconomic diversity in the city.
“Part of my whole campaign is that we’re trying to retain lower- middle-income residents,” he said. “One idea is municipal mobile housing vouchers that will apply to people who make 60 percent or less of the median income who don’t receive support from other means.”
Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 said the council should pressure businesses to provide employment opportunities for city residents, as opposed to outsourcing talent from other towns.
“What we should do is have accountable measures for every single employer who comes into town for having a ladder of opportunity for people who work there — a very set and specific percentage and expectation for them to hire people from Cambridge,” she said.
The last candidate forum on Sept. 27 tackled affordable housing — an issue that dominated the 2019 council election.
Noting the “tense” climate surrounding law enforcement in the United States, Gebru also asked candidates about their approaches to public safety in Cambridge.
Frantz Pierre, another City Council candidate, said the City should better integrate police officers into local neighborhoods to improve trust.
“It brings a bad taste in certain communities when police only show up when things are going wrong,” Pierre said. “If the person that’s getting called on is uncomfortable, and the police showing up is uncomfortable, then it’s going to be a disaster.”
Incumbent Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said his vision for the future of city-wide public safety aligns with the Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team — a proposal for non-police, resident-driven emergency response model developed by Cambridge residents and civic leaders.
“What they’re proposing is to have community members who are trained to respond to non-violent situations,” he said. “But they’re not police officers, they’re not social workers — they are trained community members who can respond to those situations, and provide trusted help without people being afraid to call 911 because they might get pulled into the carceral system.”
City Council elections for the nine seats up for grabs will take place on Nov. 2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 candidates running for federal office in 2020 benefited from the financial support of members of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body, which includes some of the country’s top finance executives, academics, and corporate lawyers.
Almost none of those candidates were Republicans.
Members of the 13-person body donated at least $1,160,263 to federal candidates and political action committees in the two years leading up to the 2020 election, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission data conducted by The Crimson.
The Harvard Corporation, formally known as the President and Fellows of Harvard College, is the most powerful entity at Harvard, exercising sway over the University’s direction and resources, and weighing in on nearly all top decisions. Chartered in 1650, it is one of two governing boards at the school, along with the alumni-elected Harvard Board of Overseers.
Corporation members donated more than $899,000 to Democratic candidates running for federal office between the 2018 and 2020 elections, FEC data show — compared to roughly $6,600 to Republicans.
The Crimson reviewed FEC records for each member of the Corporation, cross-referencing their names with their primary employers. The FEC database does not use a universal coding system to track donor data, meaning some Corporation members could have donated further under other names or employers. FEC data did not show any contributions made under billionaire David M. Rubenstein’s name and employer, the Carlyle Group.
According to The Crimson’s analysis, former United States Secretary of Commerce Penny S. Pritzker ’81 emerged as the most generous benefactor, contributing more than $861,000 mostly to Democratic U.S. Senate and House candidates.
Pritzker, a member of one of America’s wealthiest families, has a net worth of about $3.1 billion, according to Forbes, making her the 368th wealthiest person in the country. She donated $100 million to Harvard last month to support the construction of a new Economics Department building. Her brother, J.B. Pritzker, is the governor of Illinois.
She has long been a prolific political donor, having contributed at least $1.5 million to Democrats between 1990 and 2019, according to a 2019 Crimson analysis.
Lawyer Theodore V. “Ted” Wells Jr. and Harvard treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 both contributed to Republican candidates, supporting U.S. Senate campaigns in Alaska and Maine, respectively. Each also supported Democrats.
Members of the Corporation collectively donated to at least 18 PACs ahead of the 2020 elections, totalling more than $243,000.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has not made any political donations to federal candidates since taking office in 2018, according to FEC data. Before arriving at Massachusetts Hall, Bacow donated to a handful of Democratic candidates, including former presidential nominees Hillary Clinton, John F. Kerry, and Michael S. Dukakis.
William F. Lee ’72, who has served as the Harvard Corporation’s senior fellow since 2013, donated more than $47,000 to Democratic candidates ahead of the 2020 elections. Lee, who is a partner at the law firm WilmerHale, was first elected to the Corporation in 2010.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the score deadlocked at 7-7 in the final quarter of No. 15 Harvard men’s water polo’s battle against No. 9 Princeton, first-year Andrej Basica found the back of the net to help Harvard secure the lead, which it did not give up again. Ahead 8-7, the Crimson never looked back, scoring twice more to help it secure the first win of its 2021-22 Northeast Water Polo Conference (NWPC) campaign.
“The feeling was amazing to help my team win the game, but it’s just part of the job, you know,” Basica said. “My teammates are just great. All the goals I scored are because of them, they made some great passes and throws. We all worked together for it, and achieved it as a team.”
Harvard was busy on the road this weekend, with a trio of games against Princeton, St. Francis College Brooklyn, and Iona College. The Crimson brought back two wins, over the Tigers and Gaels of Iona to start the conference season with a 2-1 league record.
Harvard’s fourth consecutive triumph against Princeton, ranked No. 9 in the nation, marked its second victory against a ranked opponent this season, and its first of the NWPC campaign.
Despite initially trailing, sophomore Owen Hale netted three goals and, with additions from his teammates, closed the deficit to give Harvard the lead after the first two quarters. Basica, who had a strong debut for his squad, thwarted Princeton’s efforts to bring the score back to a tie at 7-7.
The Crimson offense was backed up masterfully by junior goalie Noah Hodge, who racked up 14 saves over the course of the match, complementing the team’s consistent goal-scoring and ensuring Harvard maintained a lead.
“I felt really good about my NWPC debut,” Basica said. “Scoring goals felt great, but individual goals don’t matter. We’re fighting for the national title, and that’s what our focus is right now. That’s what we’re working for.”
Basica’s strong debut continued with a hat-trick in the second contest against the St. Francis College Brooklyn Terriers. But it was not enough to get the Crimson across the finish line, as the squad fell two goals short in the 12-10 loss. This marked Harvard’s first regular-season NWPC loss since Oct. 6, 2018 — and its first loss against St. Francis since 2017.
Harvard coach Ted Minnis, though, said he felt confident about the team’s weekend performance.
“Obviously I would've liked to come out 3-0 and not 2-1, but I’m very happy with the progress we have been able to make, how we’ve stacked practice upon practice and get some games in there, and I think we’re finally seeing some great strides from these young men,” Minnis said.
The matchup with the Terriers was not the end of the Crimson’s weekend, however, as the squad had to regroup to face Iona College the next morning. Not letting the defeat faze it, Harvard beat the Gaels handily, 18-14. The Crimson, which did not trail at any point in the game, brought its all-time head-to-head record against Iona to 26-11. Junior Alex Tsotadze led the team with six goals and two assists, with sophomore Alexandru Bucur contributing a season-high four goals as well.
“Our goal this year is, well, we obviously want to win the NWPC, that’s the big goal. [The] smaller goal is just to keep getting better every day, growing as a team, and growing individually. I think those are the strides we need to make to achieve our bigger goal,” Minnis said.
The Crimson will host a pair of NWCP games at Blodgett Pool this weekend, against Brown on Saturday and MIT on Sunday.

The Harvard women’s tennis team had a successful weekend at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Northeast Regionals, with three players qualifying for the Northeast Super Regional tournament. The Crimson competed against players from regional schools and members of the Ivy League at the United States Military Academy at West Point.
To kick off the season, before ITA Northeast Regionals, Harvard won its first three matches versus Providence College (4-2 singles, 2-1 doubles), Boston College (8-6 singles, 4-3 doubles), and Boston University (6-1 singles, 2-2 doubles) and carried this momentum into the regional tournament.
“I’m super proud of the attitudes and effort, and we’re definitely moving in the right direction,” said veteran head coach Traci Green, who was named the Ragatz Family Harvard Women’s Coach of Excellence in 2021. “I’m excited by where this team is headed.”
The Northeast Regional was the Crimson’s first away tournament since the Covid-19 pandemic cut the 2020-21 season short.
“It was exciting and a wonderful experience to have a road trip with our team again,” Green said. “It’s been so long since we’ve had the chance to be on the road […] so we’re super grateful to have the opportunity to compete.”
Sophomore Iveta Daujoutaite capped off this weekend’s tournament with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over Dartmouth’s Chidimma Okpara. In previous rounds of the event, she bested Fairfield’s Scarlett Hutchinson in a tiebreaker after battling back from a first-set loss. Daujoutaite will also compete alongside first-year Maxi Duncan in doubles at super regionals.
First-year Rachel Arbitman qualified for the next round of the singles competition after three decisive straight-set wins. In the final round of the tournament, she defeated Boston University’s Michelle Kleynerman 6-4, 6-4.
“I had a great time just competing on the court. It was my first individual college tournament, so it was really great to get out there and compete for Harvard,” Arbitman said.
Daujoutaite and Duncan automatically qualified for the super regional tournament and did not compete together at West Point. Arbitman and fellow first-year Holly Fischer fell to Dartmouth’s Chloe Yoo and Nicole Conard in a close tiebreak, 8-7(5). The Crimson’s doubles teams competing were unable to qualify for the super regionals. First-year Angel You and senior Rachel Lim reached the round of 16 but lost a close match, 8-6, against a doubles pairing from the University of Massachusetts.
In the coming practices before the next round of the competition, the team aims to focus on improving specific components of its game.
“Everyone who qualified will be honing in on various aspects of their game where they need to improve, and they will specifically be working on raising their levels at the right times,” Green shared. “From last weekend, one of the things we definitely have to work on is raising our level at the right moments to help us push forward and come through.”
The Crimson looks to continue its winning streak as it faces off with top players from schools around the region. The three players who qualified for the ITA Northeast Super Regional will travel to Princeton, N.J., on Oct. 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, Harvard (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) chugged into Worcester on the commuter rail and, after defeating No. 24/RV Holy Cross 38-13, left on the Acela, racing towards the heart of the Ivy League regular season behind the momentum of a statement victory against a nationally ranked opponent. Cornell (0-3, 0-1 Ivy) will try to stop the newly-minted No. 22 Crimson in its tracks as the Big Red travel to Harvard Stadium in both teams’ second conference matchup of the 2021 season. The game, which will be televised on ESPN+, will take place on Oct. 9 at 1:30 p.m. ET.
Other Football Championship Series (FCS) coaches took note of the Crimson’s victory, given the strength of their opponent. The Crusaders were coming off a statement victory of their own, on the road against No. 20 Monmouth on Sept. 25, and entered the game against Harvard with a No. 24 ranking. However, Harvard dispatched them quickly, jumping out to an early 24-0 lead, as senior quarterback Jake Smith tossed three touchdown passes and the defense intercepted three Holy Cross passes.
After the game, Harvard, which had received votes in the FCS coaches’ poll entering the matchup, jumped to No. 22, its first time being nationally ranked since Nov. 11, 2016, when the Crimson, then 7-1, dropped a conference matchup to Penn, 27-14. After the team was projected to finish fourth in an Ivy League preseason media poll, it is one of only two top-25 teams in the Ancient Eight, ahead of No. 24 Princeton.
Despite the team’s accomplishment, junior linebacker Chris Smith insisted that he placed no special emphasis on the number. Chris Smith, who ranks fourth in the FCS with 0.67 forced fumbles per game, maintained his focus on the course of the entire season.
“We’ve still got a lot to prove,” he said. “We still have got a lot of good teams that we’ve got to face in our schedule, so we’re not trying to get complacent, not just happy with being ranked but obviously our goal at the end is to win the Ivy League championship.”
Coach Tim Murphy’s road to a tenth Ivy League championship will have to go through Cornell, which is coming off a 21-10 loss to Bucknell in its last game. In that game, quarterbacks Ben Mays and Richie Kenney racked up 306 yards through the air and the front seven, led by junior linebacker Jake Stebbins, held the Bison to only 97 yards on 39 carries (2.5 yards per attempt). However, the Big Red picked up only 35 rushing yards on its 23 attempts for a meager average of 1.5 yards per attempt, a number it surely hopes to improve on against the Crimson defense, which is the country’s fourth-stingiest, conceding 49.7 rushing yards per game so far.
Cornell is the best rushing defense that Harvard will have faced so far, ranking 19th in the FCS after allowing an average of 99.7 rushing yards over its first three conferences. However, it counters with a formidable challenge, its eighth-ranked rushing offense (239 yards per game). In its victories over Georgetown and Brown, the Crimson inflicted most of its damage on the ground behind its trio of talented running backs, led by junior Aaron Shampklin, who leads the FCS with 125.3 rushing yards per game. Sophomore Aidan Borguet was the 2019 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and sophomore Sone Ntoh has found paydirt twice this season.
“I think [Cornell] put together a pretty good game plan for Bucknell, but I’ll say this: I like [Borguet] and [Shampklin] a lot better than any running back we’re going to see on film or that we’re playing against,” Jake Smith said. “We’re going to be ready to go and I think 2.5 yards per rush is something that we’re going to definitely try to beat, and beat it well.”
After being pressed into action in the fourth quarter of Harvard’s win against Brown on Sept. 24, when sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean suffered an injury, Jake Smith started against Holy Cross. In his first action since 2019, he completed 20 of his 31 passes for 229 yards and three touchdowns. His performance garnered two awards: the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week and the New England Football Association’s Golden Helmet award for Division I.
If Jake Smith starts again against Cornell, he expects to be more prepared than he had been against Holy Cross, when he had to adjust from receiving minimal snaps in the early season to having control of the first-team offense in the span of a week. He already has extensive starting experience; he was the signal-caller of choice between 2017 and 2019 and holds top-ten program ranks in career completion percentage, passing yards, and passing touchdowns.
“This week, [I’ve been] basically just focusing on seeing the defense, watching those safeties and other defenders, and move around and [watching] out for that,” he said. “[I worked on] zeroing in on a couple of the reads I missed the past week.”
Against the Crusaders, Jake Smith’s top targets were first-year wide receiver Kaedyn Odermann, who turned his four catches into 70 yards and a touchdown, junior wide receiver Kym Wimberley, who hauled in three passes for 56 yards and a touchdown, and junior tight end Adam Shepherd, who caught a 29-yard touchdown pass to effectively seal the victory. Odermann’s performance earned him Ivy League Rookie of the Week, the first Crimson to do so since Borguet in the final week of 2019. In addition to Smith and Odermann, junior punter Jon Sot, a two-time All-Ivy League selection, was named Ivy League Special Teams Player of the Week after seeing five punts downed inside the 20-yard line against Holy Cross.
In the win against Holy Cross, offensive coordinator Mickey Fein turned to the air more often than he had against Georgetown and Brown. Harvard’s 229 passing yards marked its most prolific passing performance of the season, in part because the Crusaders did a good job holding Shampklin, Borguet and Ntoh in check. The three running backs managed to gain 139 yards in total, but required 39 carries to do so (3.6 yards per attempt). Overall, Murphy is likely hoping to present a balanced offense against the Big Red.
“[Fein] does a really good job with the play calls. Some of that depends on what the defense is showing us, but for the most part, I think we have a pretty balanced attack,” Jake Smith said.
Harvard’s offense will have to be both multi-dimensional and prolific to find success against the big and physical Cornell defense. Two of its safeties, Logan Thut and Chase Scarboro, weigh more than 205 pounds. In addition to its stout performance against Bucknell’s rushing attack, its oversized secondary caused consistent problems for the Bison offense, for quarterbacks Nick Semptimphelter and Tyler Beverett combined for just 146 passing yards.
Fortunately for the Crimson, it has seen a similarly physical defense in Holy Cross and found success against it. Jake Smith noted that while offensive plans can vary a lot from week to week depending on the opponent, there were a lot of similarities between the Crusaders’ defense and the Big Red’s.
Stebbins led the Big Red in sacks in 2019 with 4.5 and ranked second with 58 total tackles, earning Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors twice and being named to the All-Ivy Second Team, the only first-year defensive player to earn an All-Ivy selection. So far in 2021, he has already racked up 27 tackles, tying for 26th nationally with 9.0 tackles per game. In addition to Stebbins, cornerback Kenan Clarke and defensive lineman Onome Kessington share the team lead with one sack.
On the other side of the ball, the Big Red relies primarily on Mays, who assumed the starting job prior to the Bucknell game. In addition to his 256 passing yards, he contributed 15 yards on the ground in five carries. He took over from Kenney, who was the team’s starting quarterback in 2019 and also saw action in the fourth quarter against the Bison, completing 5 of his 11 passes for 50 yards and adding two yards on the ground. Its rushing attack is spearheaded by SK Howard, who leads the team with 67 rushing yards this season. Mays’ and Kenney’s favorite targets thus far have been Thomas Glover and Curtis Raymond.
The Crimson has also faced a similar offense to Cornell’s: Brown’s, which it limited to just fourteen rushing yards on Sept. 24. Although the Big Red defense is physical, Chris Smith expressed confidence in both Harvard’s defensive line and defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ‘99’s game plan.
“They have a solid offensive line, but we have a deep defensive line that we should be able to rotate and should be able to wear them down. I think our defensive line is definitely faster in the scheme we’re running this week, so I think we should be able to exploit their offensive line in terms of our speed and our physicality,” he said. “[Larkee] and the rest of the defensive staff just have an overall game plan and scheme of what we’re going to do.”
If Harvard is able to execute its gameplan on Saturday afternoon and earn a victory, it will be just its third in the team’s last five meetings, after Cornell eked out narrow wins in 2017 and 2018. Overall, the Crimson hold a 48-34-2 advantage in the series, which began with a 77-0 Harvard win in 1890. It will also improve Harvard’s record in Ivy League matchups to 279-162-9 (.630), the winningest mark in the Ancient Eight.
With two of its three non-conference games behind it, Harvard enters a crucial stretch as it hopes to match Penn in second place with 18 Ivy League titles all-time. Six of its remaining seven games are against conference opponents, with the lone exception being the home tilt against Lafayette on Oct. 16. Jake Smith said that while the team takes every opponent seriously, it emphasizes its conference schedule.
“It’s definitely more of an emphasis on the Ivy League opponents because we don’t have playoffs,” he said. “We’re playing for that Ivy League championship. So every time we have an Ivy League opponent, it’s definitely taken up a level.”

When we talk about being watched at Harvard, we always pin the blame on the tourists. Yes, it’s awkward when you accidentally walk into a stranger’s vlog and they keep the camera directly on your face, but we’re forgetting our most dedicated audience: Harvard’s beloved urban wildlife. They saw your shame when you trudged through the Yard, drenched in rain because you forgot your umbrella. They were there when you were stood up in front of Lamont. And they were there when you took one step outside your dorm building and realized you’d left your keys in your room. So here’s Flyby’s ranking of the urban wildlife on campus. Because let’s be real: they’re ranking us, too.
7. Roaches
People act like these guys are a staple of the Harvard experience, but they’re just unnecessary. Nothing like walking around to the back basement entrance because the roach in front of the main entrance contributes to my growth or development.
6. Centipedes
I despise these creatures, but they are good for one thing: a lesson in perspective. Are you nervous for a test? For an upcoming interview? For your professor to roast the living daylights out of your essay? Go into your dorm, turn off the lights, and google ‘house centipede’. Suddenly, your professor taking a wrecking ball to your self-esteem is exactly what you need today.
5. Rats
Rats are nightmarish little things — especially when their stomping through the classroom ceilings is louder than your TF’s voice — but Open Letter to the Rats of Harvard really made me feel for these forsaken creatures. Maybe they’re just misunderstood.
4. Birds
The birds here aren’t the most entertaining in the world, but they’re surprisingly unafraid of humans. Besides their incessant 7 a.m. squawking, they’re alright.
3. Dogs
Don’t get me wrong, I love puppers, but they’re going to have to take the number 3 spot. They’re adorable and surprisingly obedient, but there is so much FOMO that comes with watching proctors walk their dogs. When you first see them, you go “Aww! A doggo!” but five seconds later, you go “I want one too :(”
2. Turkeys. 
Those turkeys prowling the Yard make me so self-conscious. Sometimes they’re ambling down the street like they’re looking for someone to rob. Sometimes they’re sitting on the grass, watching people zone out through their million-page readings, watching athletes zoom by on their light-up scooters (seriously, where did you guys get those?), watching STEM students scramble through their psets as if they’re not about to be assigned five more as a reward for their hard work. And through it all, they’re staring us down, more judgmental than Harvard students watching tourists try to touch John Harvard’s foot.
1. Squirrels.
There’s nothing more hardcore than a Harvard squirrel. One used to eat in the tree outside my window every morning so loudly that I couldn’t even snooze my alarm. I caught another literally trying to bite into a pole. And last, but certainly not least, I watched an adult squirrel scurry up a high tree and roundhouse kick its two babies off a branch. One stuck the landing and scurried away. The other face planted on the ground and lay there shaking for a bit (he was okay, I think).
At the end of the day, though, we love all our wildlife here at Harvard despite its quirks and faults. After all, it was a human that took the last plum in the dhall — not a rat.
Disclaimer: Remy the Cat was not ranked in this, because he is not part of the “wildlife.” He is our supreme leader.
