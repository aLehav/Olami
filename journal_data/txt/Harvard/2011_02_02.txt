After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s recent declaration that the Harvard University Library (HUL) and MIT Libraries would enter into the interlibrary sharing system known as Borrow Direct has unearthed a latent debate on the risk of sharing literary resources and Harvard’s role in promoting scholarship. Although many view the decision as a long overdue entrance into a system that will benefit all parties, some have expressed reservations about the effects that exposing Harvard’s texts to the rest of the Ivy League could have. While this announcement should be hailed as a positive, progressive step for scholarship everywhere, Harvard must not allow increased library access to temper its desire for new additions to its independent collection.
Harvard is, first and foremost, an academic community. Lending and borrowing texts from other institutions only serves to strengthen the scholastic atmosphere at Harvard and beyond. Further, evidence exists suggesting that fears about HUL’s collections being depleted are largely unfounded; at present, schools with larger collections tend to use the interlibrary loan system more heavily. As Marilyn Wood, HUL’s associate librarian of collection management wrote in a recent statement, “In 2009, Dartmouth Library, one of the two smallest libraries participating in BD, was the biggest lender.”  There is thus no reason to suspect that this initiative can be anything but good for Harvard.
Further, a significant number of Harvard’s near 17 million volumes even remain untouched. The Harvard Depository, initially a warehouse for a minimal number of rarely used texts, serves as a reminder of the relative obscurity many books have languished in for years. By entering the Borrow Direct program, Harvard not only gains access to millions of monographs of material; it inserts works into intellectual discourse that may otherwise go unread or unused, a service to academia at large and a commitment to the future of scholarship and innovation.
This decision also speaks to Harvard’s broader commitment to extending education beyond its gates. Participation in Borrow Direct furthers the goal the Division of Continuing Education and televised Justice seminars already serve: to push the frontiers of scholarship and blur the distinctions between the institution and the public in ways unfathomable only decades ago. Harvard’s latest support for these ideals is encouraging, and we appreciate that University takes the initiative to educate the larger community in which it exists and on whose support its successes depend.
Nevertheless, the administration should remember that Harvard University’s expansive library system is one of the critical elements that keep Harvard at the forefront of the academic world. Beyond the scholastic import of the collections lies an intrinsic historical value that Harvard would do well to maintain. Involvement in Borrow Direct should serve as no substitute for increasing the size or scope of current collections; at the core of Harvard’s eminent library system is an aggressive acquisition program. This decision will only prove beneficial if HUL couples book sharing with a firm commitment to maintaining and strengthening current acquisition policies.
With some of the most comprehensive collections in the world, a divergence from the relatively closed library system of the past presents Harvard with a singular challenge; without the insular nature of the past, the impetus for growing an independent collection becomes less urgent. Through complacency, Harvard puts itself at risk of losing what keeps the academic community vibrant and inquisitive. If Harvard truly means to step into the future of Borrow Direct, it must also affirm the principles of the past that have made its collection the trove of knowledge it is today.

It’s all in how you say it: “Oh wow.”
From genuine elation to caustic sarcasm to absolute apathy, this year’s Optional Winter Activities Week—commonly referred to by its succinct and telling acronym name OWAW—evoked a wide spectrum of student responses. Some students marveled at the opportunities made possible by OWAW’s inaugural year such as spoken word performances, campaign planning workshops, and chocolate truffle classes; others criticized the administration for the inadequate length and funding of the week; yet a third faction of individuals advocated the novel idea of rest and relaxation during breaks. Regardless of the range of reactions and the fact that this year marked the week’s inaugural appearance, the burden of OWAW’s success or failure in the future ultimately rests on the student body.
Time and time again, we are told that Harvard is defined by its students. The administration can remove barriers to encourage frivolity, ingenuity, and intellectual curiosity during this non-compulsory opportunity on campus, but the actual push must come from the students. However valuable the offered activities may be, students need to realize their benefits in order to properly take advantage of them.
The beauty of OWAW lies in the latter part of the name. By nature of being an “activities week,” the innocuous interval helps students limited by the lack of opportunities to try new things. Students denied entrance to competitive creative writing seminars can now attend a workshop over OWAW, hone their skills, and perhaps reapply later with a higher success rate. Even those who are merely looking to dabble can scan the list of Undergraduate Council-sponsored events—Filipino Martial Arts, Punk Music, and Spoken Word, for example—to explore realms beyond their concentration without dedicating an entire semester to the effort. Of course, this is all contingent on student attendance, which can make or break the value of such programs.
The decentralized nature of OWAW breeds innovative spirit for those interested. Want to read the entire healthcare bill for fun? Go for it. Need money for your project? Apply for a UC Grant. Dissatisfied with all the options available? Start your own with all of Harvard’s resources at your disposal. Without the structure imposed by classes and time-filling extracurriculars, suddenly the Google Calendar is filled with quirky workshops or lectures that usually take a back seat to school work, prior commitments, and sleeping. But first, the interest must be there, and this is what the college should focus on going forward.
Certainly, the administration has room to improve on OWAW’s maiden voyage. Relatively late scheduling in the semester meant that booked planes flights and finalized travel plans prohibited some from returning earlier while increased funding for OWAW would exponentially increase available options. With a little practice, such wrinkles will be ironed out soon, allowing the week to become a week of great potential.
This is not an ode to OWAW, but rather a challenge to my fellow students. J-term extending into OWAW could very well be a time of repose to collect the frayed nerves scattered to the four winds by the previous semester culminating in exam week. Possibly by playing video games and eating junk food, before embarking on a new semester. There is nothing wrong with that.
Still, when next year’s OWAW rolls around, those who look across Cambridge at MIT’s month-long Independent Activities Period with envy should take an additional cursory glance around Harvard. This campus professes to have the most intellectually curious students in the world. If OWAW is something that the student body wishes to continue, we must commit to explore options and get involved. Be angry, be critical, be honest, but show up.

Harvard undergraduates, by and large, are interested in the study of politics. This is, in part, because many want to pursue careers in some aspect of politics; indeed many have already worked on political campaigns or on behave of political causes. But for many others it is simply a subject that stirs deep passion and engages their interests. They get the sense that politics matters. But whatever the reason may be, students flock to the subject. The Institute  of Politics is one of the largest student organizations on campus, and Government, Harvard’s version of the political science major, always attracts the largest, or nearly the largest, number of undergraduate concentrators.
There is nothing amiss about this fact, for politics is certainly a subject worthy of study. But students passionate about the study of politics would be well served by reflecting on the nature of their inquiry into the subject of politics, and what it should entail. For many students, the study of politics has truly become the pursuit of the science of politics, complete with regression modeling and vast amounts of data analysis. The study of politics has become something that one can do simply in excel or Stata, and without having ever opened more then a handful of classic texts. But I would argue that if we think of political inquiry in this way, we lose sight of the fact that political philosophy lies at the heart of the enterprise. The turn towards a largely scientific study of politics runs the risk of obscuring the fundamental questions of politics, and the reasons that politics deeply matters to so many people. The study of politics must always come back to fundamental normative questions, the questions pursued by political philosophy.
But the centrality of philosophy to the study of politics remains largely brushed over. There seem to be two main reasons for this, which are connected. The first is the tendency to deny that the study of politics is first and foremost concerned with actual governance. Political science did not originate as a pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, but as a way of debating and arriving at actual political decisions. And this requires a stance on normative questions. The kinds of questions that must be answered to make political decisions expose the second mistake that political science often makes, the idea that the study of politics progresses as it becomes more like physics or biology—scientific. But thinking about the study of politics in this manner misses the core of political inquiry, normative philosophy. If we think of the relationship between Democritus and modern physics to be analogous to that of Plato and modern political science, and likewise see political philosophy as no more then a vestigial subject left over in political science departments from the days of the broad moral science tracks in universities, then we will have made a grave mistake. Democritus has been banished to history of science or humanities departments because he asks questions that no longer seem relevant to the study of modern physics. But the same cannot be said of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Hobbes, or Machiavelli. The questions they ask are still fundamental to the study of politics.
Which is not to say that mathematical modeling or data analysis cannot aide us in answering these questions, or even help us clarify what the appropriate questions and inquiry of political science should entail. But a scientific study of politics cannot answer the fundamental questions of political inquiry, and that is why Plato remains relevant to political science today in a way that Democritus does not to the study of physics. A scientific study of politics cannot answer the questions posed by Cicero regarding the duties citizens have to each other, which may differ from the duties citizens have to inhabitants of far off lands. Nor can statistical analysis answer Plato’s eternal questions about who is fit to rule.
Students, therefore, who have a passion for studying politics, would do well to consider furthering their study of political philosophy in this coming semester. Far from being a neglected stepchild of the Government department, the study of political philosophy should hold a central and formative position in the education of any student of politics. Not only does it provide us with the basis for deciding which kinds of questions must be answered by political inquiry, but it also tells us why answering these questions matters at all. It is only by examining the fundamental normative questions of politics that all other avenues of political inquiry gain relevance and deserve our attention

Imagine a job where, four years after you began your career, you are essentially guaranteed a 50 percent raise, generous healthcare benefits, and, best of all, your pay raises are not connected at all to your performance. It sounds cushy and far-fetched, but according to a report recently published by The Boston Foundation this is the situation for Boston’s 5,905 public school teachers.
According to the report’s findings, Boston teachers are able to reach the top of the pay scale in just nine years, the shortest amount of time for the country’s 75 largest school districts. The 183-day work year and 1,220 contractually required hours are shorter than teachers in most other cities. Moreover, the average teacher salary in Boston is $72,000, which is about $13,000 higher than the state average (though not Cambridge, where the average teacher salary is $85,000).
Public school teachers deserve high salaries. The work they do is just as important as that of brain surgeons and corporate lawyers; yet their salaries don’t come close to comparing. Unfortunately, however, it is far too easy to interpret The Boston Foundation study as justification for cutting the salaries of BPS teachers (this is the interpretation that the Boston Teacher’s Union is eager to take), especially with the district’s current $63 million budget shortfall.
The strategic release of the report, titled “The Real Cost of the Contract,” coincides with current contract negotiations between Boston Public Schools and the Boston Teacher’s Union. Richard Stutman, president of the BTU, summarized the report’s argument in his own words in an e-bulletin as: “we [teachers] earn too much money for the little work that we do.” In his weekly BTU e-Bulletin to members, Stutman took issue with the Foundation’s claim that “BPS teachers contractually have a shorter school day than their counterparts around the country.” The teacher workday goes beyond the school bell, Stutman argues, and includes grading work, parent-teacher conferences, planning and preparation, etc. Fair enough. But having a contract that details down to the minute how long a teacher can teach (282 minutes for elementary, 307 minutes for secondary) is not what’s best for Boston students and not what’s best for American students to remain globally competitive.
The second premise that Stutman contends in the statement is the report’s claim that teachers are “overpaid” (the report does not explicitly argue this and never makes use of the word). With the high cost of living in Boston, the need to take graduate courses every several years, and the out-of-pocket expense teachers spend on school supplies, teacher salaries are not out of line with similarly educated local jobs, he argues. (He also succeeds, in what feels like a low blow, in mentioning that The Boston Foundation president earned $570,000 last year.)
To be sure, being a great teacher requires a lot of work and a lot of hours. And great teachers deserve six-figure salaries. The recent arguments coming from BTU, however, would have you believe both of these ideals are in jeopardy. It makes sense that Stutman would want to have his members believe that The Boston Foundation’s report seeks to cut salaries and accuse teachers of being lazy. It’s a distraction from the report’s implicit purpose: that great teachers need to be rewarded as such and bad teacher need to be fired. Simply put, teaching needs accountability. It can feel odd to talk about such a revered profession in such blunt terms, but as Michelle A. Rhee said when she recently spoke at the IOP, teaching is a privilege, not a right. And Boston public school students deserve a teaching force that reflects that idea.
In the broader education reform movement, the seemingly ordinary phrase “accountability” has been an incredibly politically charged word. When unionists and traditional liberals hear the word, they imagine “teaching to the test,” No Child Left Behind, test scores, tests, tests, Scantrons, and more tests. Understandably, teachers are reluctant and often outright unwilling to have their salaries linked to a composite standardized test score. (The conveniently forgotten truth, however, is that no one is advocating such a one-dimensional scheme.) For the new crop of private sector and corporate types interested in education reform, the need for “accountability” in public education is a no-brainer. To them, it’s frustrating that goal-oriented and bottom-line driven philosophies are so lacking in public education.
The report avoids making such arguments (the word “accountability” is mentioned only once) and instead wades through the 300-page contract and lays out the cold, hard facts of the BTU contract. The most troubling aspect of the contract is not that a teacher can earn a 50 percent raise in four years; rather, that such an increase can occur regardless of whether or not that teacher’s students are learning.

Amid protests that have drawn thousands of Egyptians to the streets in defiance of the government, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak announced yesterday he would not seek re-election when his term expires this fall, but Harvard professors and students agree it will do little to quell the ongoing Egyptian uprising.
Mubarak’s announcement came after hundreds of thousands of Egyptians gathered yesterday in Midan Tahrir—”Liberation Square” in Arabic—for the largest demonstration yet in what has been a week of sustained protests against a government that has stifled dissent and trampled on civil liberties.
“At this time it’s hard to imagine the population dispersing from Midan Tahrir and being satisfied with Mubarak’s current promise,” Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and Anthropology Professor Peter Der Manuelian wrote in an e-mailed statement. “My hope is that this doesn’t increase the tension and violence.”
The clashes between police and protesters have often grown violent, with riot police using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse anti-government protesters. Media reports have also been peppered with accounts of looting in the country’s capital, Cairo, where the unrest has been centered.
History of Science Lecturer Ahmed Ragab, who grew up in Egypt and whose family is participating in the protests, watched Mubarak’s speech last night on a live feed from the Al Jazeera website and said that the long-time dictator’s concessions may be insufficient to mollify protesters’ concerns.
“[The protesters’] reaction was unmistakable and the same as mine,” Ragab wrote in an e-mailed statement. “The crowds roared and chanted ‘Leave ... leave, we do not want you.’”
NELC professor Ali Asani called Mubarak’s latest moves “attempts to save face” and said that nothing short of his resignation would end the protests.
“The momentum for change has really built up and I think there’s a coalition of forces that has decided that the old regime just needs to go,” he said.
Mubarak became President of Egypt in 1981 and has clung to power ever since through a combination of repression and sham elections. But theannouncement that he would not seek a new term in September elections is too little too late, according to Ragab.
“I think Mubarak’s speech is a desperate attempt at saving his reign and autocratic rule through implementing reforms, which were called for many times through the past decade and which he refused to implement through the years,” he said.
“The people will not relent until Mubarak’s rule is ended,” he added.
Tarek Anous, a research assistant in physics who attended high school in Egypt, said he agrees that the protests are likely to continue until Mubarak resigns.
“I don’t think his comments have any bearing on what the protesters will do,” Anous said. “There are some people who are probably getting tired of protesting, but I think the general consensus is that he needs to go.”
The announcement that Mubarak will not seek re-election sets the stage for the first free elections in Egypt in recent memory but raises the question whether, in the interim, Mubarak will crack down on opposition and backpedal on his promise to step down.
“Eight or nine months in office is plenty of time to crack down on the protests and to arrest and suppress the opposition, as [Mubarak] has done for the last 30 years,” said Abdelnasser A. Rashid ’11-’12, a former president of the Harvard Islamic Society.
Ahmed S. Belal ’12, who grew up in Egypt and whose family is participating in the protests, agreed Mubarak must resign immediately.
“There cannot be a new legitimate democracy with Mubarak involved in it,” he said. “He’s a figurehead of the oppressive regime. He’s directly responsible for a lot of the deaths that have taken place over the last week and over the last 30 years. His policies have held back Egypt for thirty years.”

Professors for some of the largest spring course offerings said that the utility of the College’s experiment with pre-term planning remains unclear given the disparity between pre-registration numbers and the final enrollment for their classes.
The tool, released in November, required students to mark down those classes they expected to take in the spring. But enrollment numbers in some cases remained unpredictable, forcing professors to readjust the number of teaching fellows for their courses.
“We have wonderful TFs, but we had to go scramble to find them,” said English Professor Louis Menand, who teaches U.S. in the World 23: “Art and Thought in the Cold War.”
He said that the inaccurate pre-term planning numbers compounded the usual troubles that surround the TF hiring process.
Menand had originally hired TFs based on previous years’ enrollments of approximately 260 students. But upon seeing the pre-term planning numbers—which indicated that only 146 students were planning to enroll—Menand had to reassign TFs to other classes.
When, in fact, 339 students signed up for his class, Menand had to race over the weekend to restaff the class.
“We had to go through the process twice,” Menand said. “I lost some TFs I had wanted.”
For new classes, pre-term planning numbers were the only predictors available to make staffing decisions. But Senior Lecturer in History Ivan Gaskell, who is co-teaching U.S. in the World 30: “Tangible Things: Harvard Collections in World History,” said that the predicted enrollment of 66 did not reflect the eventual 250 students who registered
or the class. The class has since hired five additional TFs to join the original four and moved from Sever 113 to the larger Yenching Auditorium.
Yet some professors said that when they originally received unexpected pre-term planning numbers, the data allowed them to begin planning for larger class sizes in January. When the numbers indicated that nearly 100 more students planned to take Psychology 15: “Social Psychology” than had in previous years, Professor Joshua D. Greene ’97 began looking for more TFs.
While fewer students eventually enrolled in the class than the pre-term planning data had indicated, Greene said that having rough knowledge about a larger class size smoothed the transition into the new semester.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, minimizing last-minute TF shuffling is one of the top goals of pre-term planning.
“My main concern is really to make sure that we’re putting the best prepared people in the classroom,” he said.
Harris said that it is still too early to determine the accuracy of the pre-term planning predictions. He said the Office of Undergraduate Education will not finish its analysis until the end of this week at the earliest.

Former students, colleagues, and family members of Gerald S. “Gerry” Lesser, one of the biggest forces behind the formation of “Sesame Street,” gathered yesterday evening at a Harvard Graduate School of Education panel to honor the legacy of the longtime Ed School professor.
Lesser passed away last September at age 84, following a distinguished career which also included a 27-year stint as the chairperson of the Children’s Television Workshop—a nonprofit organization, now known as the Sesame Workshop, which helps to create educational children’s programs. Lesser was honored yesterday in order to allow his family proper time to grieve and to invite speakers who knew him best, according to Ed School spokesperson Michael G. Rodman.
Although Lesser spent 35 years on the Ed School faculty, many of those who spoke at the event emphasized his most well-known legacy: the creation of “Sesame Street” and the partnership he fostered between what speaker Sam Gibbon called “egocentric television producers and egocentric professors.”
“Nobody thought it would work,” said Gibbon, a former producer of several educational children’s shows. Many speakers mentioned that, prior to “Sesame Street,” television was generally viewed as detrimental to a child’s learning, and it was Lesser’s work that helped to alter that mindset.
“He trailblazed a path—from entertainment to education—for an entire industry,” said Gary Knell, the current President and CEO of Sesame Workshop. “It was about the power of razzle dazzle to pull children in.”
Many of the speakers expressed admiration for Lesser, who was known for his leadership and approachability while he was working simultaneously at Harvard and “Sesame Street.”
Dina L. G. Borzekowski, Associate Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, spoke of “Gerry Lesser the Professor,” who always took attendance in his classes and showed clips of “Sesame Street” before lectures.
“When he was on that fourth floor [in his office],” Borzekowski said, “his door was always open.”
Lesser was never featured as a character on “Sesame Street,” but he appeared in a film clip conversing with Kermit the Frog about how “Sesame Street” would teach children about the alphabet. The video also exhibited how the show would teach the letter “J” using an animation of “Joe and his Junebug.”
Lesser asked children to watch these scenes and tested them afterwards. It was this research that created the curriculum for “Sesame Street” and demonstrated how television could serve an educational purpose.
“It’s not as if we’ve solved these problems, [but] we can now move the needle with media,” said Robert Lippincott, Senior Vice President of Education at PBS.
A “Sesame Street” initiative to connect with ethnic minorities led Saman Rouhani ’14 to appear on two televised episodes of Sesame Street. Rouhani, who is of Persian descent, said scouts found his sister and him as young children in elementary school.
“In the ’90s, they were trying to recruit kids to reflect diversity in New York City,” Rouhani said. As a “Grouchketeer,” Rouhani donned an Oscar the Grouch costume and a tin garbage lid as a hat.
“I was totally psyched,” he said. “It was ‘Sesame Street!’”

Due to their increased capacity for innovative rationalization, creative people are more likely to engage in unethical behavior, according to a Harvard Business School study.
Francesca Gino, an associate professor at HBS and a co-author of the working paper, said the findings may have important implications for business administration and organization.
“What we’re really interested in is how organizations can promote good behavior with creativity, but not cause [their workers] to behave in a way that promotes unethical behavior,” said Gino, who collaborated on the study with Duke University Behavioral Economics Professor Dan Ariely.
The study—which is currently being peer reviewed—concluded that people who work in creative professions have a greater tendency to compromise their morality.
“There is a lot of a research suggesting good consequences in terms of productivity and beneficial outcomes when people are creative,” said Gino. “We want organizations and managers to be aware not only of good consequences, but that there might also be some dark consequences as well.”
Although Gino said that a creative person will not necessarily engage in unethical activity, she said she believes that there is a link between the two factors.
“It’s possible that always being confronted by demands to try to be creative and innovative can make people think about ethical loopholes,” Gino said.
To counter this tendency for immorality among creative people, Gino said she advocates a work environment that promotes ethical behavior.
Businesses and organizations can create these reminders by “looking at the type of language used in ethics codes” and “creating environmental cues that remind us of our childhood and children,” Gino said.
Gino added that she hopes her findings inspire businesses and organizations to think more critically about issues of creativity.
“It’s important to understand the limits and boundaries of fostering creativity at work,” she said.
Shelley H. Carson, who is an associate of the psychology department, said that the study’s findings are consistent with previous research.
“We’ve known much longer than this that there is a correlation between at least minor dishonesty and creativity,” she said. “The idea has been around for quite a while.”

The Progressive Caucus at Harvard Kennedy School gave away home-made pastries yesterday in the John F. Kennedy Forum as a tongue-in-cheek attempt to raise awareness of the low percentage of women faculty members at the school.
Timed to coincide with the return of former University President Lawrence H. Summers to teach at HKS, the event was titled “Welcome Back Larry—Availability of Aptitude Bakeoff for Girls and Math.” In 2005, Summers made controversial statements about women and science, suggesting that innate differences, rather than gender discrimination, may explain why women are less likely than men to succeed in the hard sciences.
The organization decided to give away pastries to make fun of the archaic belief that women might only be good at baking, according to Emily R. Polak, co-chair of the Progressive Caucus.
According to the 2010 annual report of the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, women accounted for approximately 27 percent of the junior faculty and 22 percent of the senior faculty at HKS in 2009-10.
By comparison, three out of the four peer institutions used as benchmarks in the report boasted a higher percentage of female junior faculty members in 2010, while the fourth had an equal number. Senior faculty percentages were higher at two of the peer schools.
“Increasing the number of women faculty at HKS—particularly tenured women faculty—has been an important priority of Dean [David T.] Ellwood’s,” HKS spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an e-mailed statement. Jackson noted that the number of tenured women faculty has more than doubled since Ellwood took office in 2004.
Yesterday’s event is the first step the Progressive Caucus, an HKS student organization that aims to bring greater social justice to both the school and to society at large, has taken towards raising awareness of the gender imbalance.
Alexander W.C. Way, a member of the Progressive Caucus, added that, because of the low number of women in politics in general, it is essential that HKS take steps to increase their roles.
But despite the event’s title, Polak remained positive about Summers’ return to Harvard.
“I think the fact that he’s apologized suggests that he’s eager to make changes,” Polak said.
A wide range of HKS students, both conservative and liberal, supported the pastry giveaway.
“It’s a bipartisan cause,” said Casey E. Osterkamp, co-chair of the HKS Republican Caucus.
“I just think that we need to generate supported dialogue about women’s issues here,” said Beth S. Pollack, co-chair of the HKS Democratic Caucus.

“Bite it,” Trisha R. Paul ’13 said, “and let it swirl around your tongue for a few minutes.”
As Calvin K. W. Chin ’14 popped a crimson-colored, almond-shaped berry into his mouth, his friend James D. Carey ’14 cautiously nibbled on a wedge of lime.
“Whoa, I could eat a whole lime, dude,” Carey said, grabbing another wedge from the platter.
Under the dim chandelier lights in Winthrop dining hall, students gathered last night to try synsepalum dulcificum—more commonly known as the ‘miracle berry’—a small fruit that makes sour foods taste sweet. Native to West Africa, the berries contain a protein called miraculin that binds with the taste receptors on the tongue and acts as a sweetness inducer when it comes in contact with acids.
Sponsored by the Food Literacy Project, the event allowed students to play with their taste buds by causing apple cider vinegar to taste like “the nectar of God,” as Rupak K. Bhuyan ’13 put it.
“Miracle berries react chemically with saliva and make sour things taste sweet,” said Paul, who serves as Winthrop House FLP Rep.
Paul and Elan Q. Nguyen ’13, the Lowell House FLP Rep, cut lemons, limes, and kiwis into bite-sized slices and arranged them on an oval platter next to a bowl of apple cider vinegar and plain yogurt.
After coating their tongues with the berries for about two minutes, students tried wedges of limes and lemons, scoops of plain yogurt, and even spoonfuls of vinegar.
“The lime has a Sweet’N Low aftertaste,” Julian Moll-Rocek ’12 said.
“And the yogurt tastes like sweetened yogurt,” Christa M. Simone ’12 added.
But the miracle berry did not show its miraculous effect on Shyam S. Vichare ’12.
“My tongue is about to get destroyed because of all the acid,” he said, squinting his eyes as he took a lemon out of his mouth.
“One of the goals of FLP is to teach something new to people and cultivate awareness and appreciation for food,” Nguyen said.
In the past, FLP has hosted a spring roll workshop, a top chef competition among the Houses, a chocolate tasting, and a dining hall kitchen tour.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Graduate School of Education report released today calls for an increase in vocational training in high schools, suggesting that attending college may not be the best choice for all secondary school students.
“Pathways to Prosperity” states that the current system of education is not adequately preparing students for the real world, according to project director William C. Symonds.
“The ‘one-size-fits-all’ model just doesn’t work for everybody,” he said. “There’s a variety of pathways to success.”
In his 2009 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama encouraged Americans to return to school and said that every American would need more than a high school diploma. But the report states that much of the time, students attending post-secondary schools fail to graduate on time with a diploma. In four-year schools, only 56 percent of students graduate with a diploma in six years, and in two-year schools, less than 30 percent graduate in three years. Indeed, the U.S. has the highest college drop-out rate in the industrialized world, according to the report.
“What does that say about the future of our economy and the future of our society?” Symonds said.
The report, which was headed by Ed School Professor Robert B. Schwartz, found that “many young adults lack the skills and work ethic needed for many jobs that pay a middle-class wage” and noted that the teen employment rate is 28.6 percent, the lowest it has been since the Great Depression.
The report states that students are often pushed to succeed academically and to attend post-secondary schools, but according to project co-chair Ronald F. Ferguson, college may not be the best option for all students.
“Pretending that everyone is headed for a college degree is just not fair to those for whom college is not a good fit. They need other options,” Ferguson wrote in an e-mailed statement.
According to the report, only one-third of jobs in America require a bachelor’s degree, as opposed to 36 percent that do not necessitate a college diploma at all. The report calls for schools to partner with businesses in order to incorporate more job training into their curricula, with the intention of preparing students for their future vocations. The report also cites European nations as a model, highlighting the Czech Republic, which educates almost 80 percent of its students in either vocational training or a combined program with academics. Czech students have a higher rate of graduating from high school than students in the United States.
While the report looks to European nations for guidance in implementing vocational programs, it does not address the social and economic differences that exist between the United States and Europe, which Ferguson said could be a point of debate. “I expect that the main criticism is that the report does not answer all of the questions it raises,” he said.
Symonds said he hopes the report will alter the way education policy is formulated in the United States.
“We need to engage in a national dialogue—a dramatic shift in the way Americans look at education,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Talented writers in the Class of 2016 may have the opportunity to hone their literary skills in an advanced expository writing class that will serve as an alternative to the current mandatory freshman Expos offerings.
In the first Faculty meeting of the new semester, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris introduced a proposal for a new advanced course, Expository Writing 30.
At a meeting focused on student academics, Harris also presented a proposal to modify the system of Latin honors that will slightly ease the requirements for the summa cum laude degree, the highest academic honor.
HONORS WRITING
Harris said the Standing Committee on Writing and Speaking has spent the past year reviewing the expository writing curriculum and its effectiveness in preparing students for future writing courses.
The addition of Expos 30 to the course offerings is part of a larger initiative to prepare freshmen for academic writing.
Currently, the Harvard College Writing Program—the oldest such program in the nation, established in 1872—offers Expos 10, an introductory course for students who need additional writing support, and Expos 20, a mandatory class for all students.
The committee is also evaluating the effectiveness of Expos 10.
“We felt it was important to build bridges from Expos to sophomore tutorials,” Harris said yesterday in the Faculty meeting. “This is a major effort.”
Sosland Director in the Harvard College Writing Program Thomas R. Jehn and Harris are currently leading the review process of the Expos curriculum. Among the first proposed changes is a revised writing placement exam that incoming freshmen will take before being recommended for an expository writing class.
“We feel [the current placement exam] does a good job finding the weakest writers, [but] not finding the strongest writers,” Harris said.
Jehn and Harris said they hope to use the new test to identify students for the Expos 30 class that will start in the fall of 2012.
“The prospect of this class is very exciting for me,” Jehn said, adding that the precise number of sections for the new course has not been determined.
RE-WRITING THE HONORS
Harris held the stage to present a motion to revise the Latin honors system for graduating seniors, including reducing certain requirements.
The proposal increases the pool of summa cum laude recipients from a subjective number between the top four and five percent to a flat five percent every year.
Further, Harris moved to modify a policy that requires students to receive an A-level grade in at least two classes in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Sciences in order to receive the highest Latin honor.
“The handbook language that we use to communicate with faculty and students [about honors] is generally opaque,” Harris said. “So the committee has suggested some clarifications to the handbook language.”
If the proposal is approved at the next Faculty meeting, it will apply to the Class of 2012.
HONORS TEACHING
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith underscored at the beginning of the meeting his continued initiative on teaching and learning—an administrative campaign to boost the level of instruction across FAS.
To this end, Smith invited faculty members to a presentation headlined by three instructors: Computer Science Lecturer David J. Malan ’99, Professor of the Practice of Theatre Diane M. Paulus ’87, and Sociology Professor Christopher Winship.
Smith’s emphasis on teaching and learning has been credited by faculty members and administrators for helping to boost concentration satisfaction numbers in every concentration across FAS in the recently published 2010 senior survey results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After University President Drew G. Faust made a series of announcements at yesterday’s Faculty meeting—including notifying those present of today’s closure of Widener Library due to snow—she asked for questions, and silence followed.
“When is it going to stop snowing?” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith asked, referring to the ongoing snowfall that was slated to cancel some classes and hinder commuters across the University.
“I don’t know. Good question,” Faust responded, thanking the “intrepid” faculty members who made it out to the meeting in University Hall.
CUM WHAT?
Reviewing an age-old practice of conferring honor degrees to exemplary students, the Faculty questioned the long-term value of these academic achievements.
“I have been teaching at Harvard for 37 years now, and the two students I’ve taught who have had the biggest impact on the world didn’t even earn their degrees, much less with honors,” Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote in an e-mail to the Crimson after the meeting.
While Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented a proposal for changing the criteria for receiving the award, Lewis and other professors entered a larger discussion on the significance of grades outside the Harvard gates.
Some faculty members said the need to retain a high GPA for an Honors degree may serve to disincentivize students who want to take courses outside of their comfort zones.
Lewis wrote that except for certain academic careers, “in my experience high grades at Harvard don’t predict future success very well.”
“Of course when discussing Harvard students you are talking about a very talented pool to begin with,” Lewis wrote, “but that is why I wish the emphasis on grades and honors could be ratcheted down.”
Even Harris questioned the utility of the Latin honors, despite the lengthy process of reforming the program.
“Most people seem to think that magna is higher than summa in the outside world,” Harris said.
THROWING OUT THE PAPER
At a meeting steeped in tradition, Harris demonstrated that the Faculty was prepared for the new decade.
In his presentation, he showed his savvy tech skills by reading notes from an iPad as he addressed the Faculty.
In an e-mail to The Crimson after the meeting, Harris praised his modern gadget.
“[I] don’t have anything to say other than that I love it,” Harris wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning five of the 15 individual races at the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton invitational, the freshman class of the men’s swimming team has spectators wondering what exactly the FDO has been putting in the Yard’s water supply this year.
Indeed, the Harvard men’s swim team’s class of 2014 has been a beast in the pool.
“[Our performance at the HYP meet] proved how well we dominated in the [regular] season and shows how well we can do in the future and over the next four years,” said freshman distance freestyle swimmer Wes Stearns.
This July, collegeswimming.com ranked the Crimson’s 2010 recruiting class as the No. 20 fastest in the nation, and the men have not failed to live up to their reputations. Dominating in short and long distances, freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly, the freshmen have stepped up this season above and beyond most of their predecessors.
“I have to give the freshman class credit for their work ethic and consistency,” coach Tim Murphy said. “They have the excitement and energy for what they’re doing...and [the team has] benefitted from the environment we’ve gotten from it. I think they have all stepped up in their own way.”
Although the 10 swimmers who make up the freshman class only comprise a fraction of the undefeated team, they more than pulled their weight. This past weekend in New Haven, Conn., five different Harvard rookies won their respective events. First Spenser Goodman and Chris Satterthwaite both touched in at 1:38.99 to tie for first place in the 200 free. Then classmate Jack Pretto edged out junior teammate Robert Newell to win the 100 back and fellow freshman Oliver Lee won the 50 free for the second consecutive meet.
Finally, Stearns, who has won an event in each of the last six meets, hit NCAA ‘B’ cut with a time of 15:23.85 to solidify the freshman class’ commanding accomplishments at the HYP meet and throughout the season.
In addition to the freshman winners at the HYP meet, backstroker Jason Ting and diver Joe Zarrella have both contributed victories to the Crimson’s perfect record, while the remainder of the rookies have each placed in their respective events.
Collegeswimming.com may have predicted an impressive performance from Harvard’s incoming class of recruits before the season even began, but the freshman cannot help but credit the upperclassmen with much of their success.
“The upperclassmen have been really inspirational,” Satterthwaite said. “They’re guys we can look up to—whether as role models for swimming or to talk about academic issues. [Following their advice] allows us to focus on swimming and the important issues.”
Additionally, Satterthwaite points to the freshmen’s unique class dynamic as another reason for their success.
“We haven’t had many [freshmen] competing head-to-head unless it’s mutually beneficial,” Satterthwaite said. “We haven’t had a lot of one [freshman’s] success meaning another one’s failure. One guy’s success just gets the other guys pumped.”
While the men’s season is heading into Ivy League Championships next month, the freshmen are already hoping their impressive times will help attract another set of fast recruits, ideally a set of even faster ones.
“When we get a good class like we did this year, we make news in the swimming world,” Goodman said. “When we get the word out, we get faster recruits...and it’s just a cycle like that. Every year is getting faster, and next year’s recruiting class will likely be in the top ten.”
Coming into the end of the season, the Crimson will certainly appreciate having these secret weapons around. The freshmen are a threat in the water right now, but their older teammates are even more excited to see how they fare for the rest of their careers.
“The upperclassmen are really excited for the next few years, because they are excited for our success and they are excited about the years to come,” Satterthwaite said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since my first day as a sports editor of The Crimson, I have had but one goal: to convince the newspaper to pay for me to jet off to some faraway destination to cover a Big-Deal Game.
Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating. But by picking up women’s hockey as my first-ever beat, I knew I was drafting a winner. After all, in my first season as a writer, the team made it all the way to the NCAA Frozen Four. My older and wiser co-writer got to make that free trip to Duluth (though as he will readily remind me, Duluth in March is far from a glamorous destination) and ever since, I’ve been patiently waiting for my turn.
As it turns out, not every season can be a fairy tale like 2007-08 was for Harvard women’s hockey. The Crimson has continued to be a powerhouse in the ECAC, winning the regular-season title in 2009 before placing third last year, extending its streak of finishing third or better in the conference to eight straight seasons.
But each successful season ended with Harvard being upset in the playoffs, falling short of its goal of capturing its first-ever NCAA title.
When things didn’t go so hot at the beginning of this season, I started to doubt that the Crimson would even earn an invitation to the so-called dance.
But as the calendar turns to February, it turns out that I’ve underestimated the team I’ve been covering for so long.
While most of us may be demoralized after trudging through the slushy streets every day, the Crimson seems to be drawing strength from the dropping temperatures and ever-growing snow drifts.
The women have shaken off their slow start to rattle off a six-game winning streak, rising back up to second in the conference and 10th in the national polls.
And really, I shouldn’t have been surprised.
After all, this is exactly what the team has done for the last three years.
Flashback to Jan. 6, 2009: Harvard sat at 6-7-3 after dropping a 3-0 decision at home to Dartmouth. It went on to win 13 out of 15 games before being shocked in the conference semifinals by Rensselaer, leaving the Crimson as the first team out of the eight-team NCAA field.
Jan. 16, 2010: Though Harvard was in good shape at 9-4-4, a 5-1 win over Colgate was the last game goalie Christina Kessler would ever play in a Crimson uniform.
Despite losing the NCAA record-setting netminder, Harvard rode then-freshman Laura Bellamy to 11 wins in 15 games before falling at home to Cornell in the NCAA quarterfinals.
Jan. 8, 2011: Rensselaer once again gets the best of the Crimson, beating Harvard 2-1 in Troy and dropping the Crimson to 6-7-2. Harvard hasn’t lost since.
The Crimson has found success by doing exactly what it’s always done: sharing the scoring load, playing lockdown defense, and using its experience and conditioning to grind out wins. And with Princeton and Quinnipiac—two youthful upstarts who faltered against previously-struggling Clarkson last weekend—coming to town, there’s no reason to think Harvard can’t run that streak to eight or more.
But even if the Crimson goes undefeated through the rest of the conference season, a spot in the NCAA tournament is far from a guarantee.
Harvard sits 10th both in the national polls and in most of the computer models, with only two of the top 10 teams left on its schedule—No. 2 Cornell on Feb. 19 and either No. 3 BU or No. 7 BC in the second round of the Beanpot.
The only surefire way to guarantee a spot in the tournament is to earn the ECAC’s automatic bid.
That means finding a way to solve Cornell, a squad that hasn’t lost since Nov. 2.
It’s an uphill battle, to be sure. But if the Crimson keeps playing the way it’s been playing, it’s got a good chance to halt the Big Red’s perfect conference season.
During its six-game win streak, 15 players have collected points on Harvard’s 20 goals, with 11 of them finding the back of the net. Tri-captain Liza Ryabkina (three goals, five assists) and sophomore Jillian Dempsey (two goals, five assists) are averaging more than a point per game, while tri-captain Kate Buesser has scored in four of the last five contests.
On the defensive end of the ice, Bellamy has hit her stride in net.
The sophomore has allowed just one goal per game and is regaining the confidence she had down the stretch last season.
When Cornell rolls into town in two and a half weeks, it will likely have the regular-season title already secured. The Crimson will still have a lot to play for, and besting the Big Red could give the team a spark heading into the postseason—and perhaps also some leverage in the polls.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Harvard’s not a perfect team—in fact, its penalty kill is ranked 33rd out of 35 Division I programs—but it’s one that has been consistently improving.
Will the season end with me on a free flight to Erie, Penn., for the Frozen Four?
It may be a long shot, but it’s far from impossible.
There’s still time for the Crimson’s six seniors—Ryabkina, Buesser, tri-captain Leanna Coskren, Katharine Chute, Ashley Wheeler, and Deborah Conway—to get their one last shot at women’s hockey’s top prize.

In the latest installment of Saturday Night Lives' seemingly never-ending parody of "The Social Network," this past weekend's episode of SNL began with not one, but all three "Zuckerbergs."
Jessie Eisenberg, whose portrayal of Facebook's infamous founder has earned him an Oscar nomination, was joined on stage mid-monologue by Andy Samberg, SNL's resident Mark Zuckerberg impersonator. While the two swapped impersonation tips such as "wearing the sweatshirt" and "speaking in short, quick sentences, keeping the head still," Mark Zuckerberg himself stood behind the stage ready to make a surprise on-screen appearance. Interrupting the discussion, Zuckerberg emerges to reveal details concerning the identity of the real "Zuck."
The three proceed to deliver the opening monologue, and Zuckerberg finally answers the question of what he thought of "The Social Network" by simply saying, "it was interesting."

Imagine a campus where students are never stressed, where students make time for fun in their schedules, a campus known for being happy…
Harvard? Definitely not.
To some this may seem like a world far away from the reality of Harvard, but this is exactly the type of campus that "The Happiness Project" aims to create.
"The goal for this project centers around making students happier and less stressed. Rather than having a culture where stress is the norm, we should try to have one where we focus on building a schedule to leave room for self-care. With such a focus, everyone's happiness level will ultimately go up," said Leslie R. Rith-Najarian '12, the organizer of the project.
The project will organize events that encourage people to live happier lives by promoting activities that people love to do rather than activities people feel they should be doing.
"Basically, it's a student model of a happy lifestyle, in whatever way that can mean to people," Rith-Najarian said.
The room will be student-staffed Monday through Friday evenings. It will be packed with whatever students want, including board games, a ping-pong table, a Wii game set, and other items donated by local alumni.
The project's first meeting is today at 8 p.m. at the SOCH.
"I just want to give people the permission to be more happy and less stressed," Rith-Najarian said.
Permission granted, Harvard! Now go play!

Do you have a great idea? There is still time to enter it in this year's I3 competition. The directors of the Harvard Innovation Challenge have announced a brand new TECH Prize, sponsored by North Bridge Venture Partners. In light of this change, the deadline for project submissions has been extended to Feb. 5.
The TECH Prize is named after the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard, and has been awarded yearly to Harvard College seniors. North Bridge Venture Partner's donation will increase the total prize to $15,000. Additionally, I3 has decided to open up the contest to graduate students from all Harvard schools, said Alex R. Gerson '12, who is organizing the competiton. Because the competition is open to a new group of students, the deadline has been pushed back.
The Innovation Challenge is presented annually by Harvard Student Agencies (HSA) and TECH and awards grants to innovative projects. This year, they said they received a record number of applications.
