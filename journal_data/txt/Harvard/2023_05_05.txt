This article contains spoilers for Season 5, Episode 1 of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”
After four seasons of performing stand-up, donning glamorous outfits, and bickering good-naturedly with her agent and partner-in-crime Susie Myerson (Alex Borstein), Miriam “Midge” Maisel will finally be saying goodbye to audiences forever as the “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” comes up on its fifth and final season. The Emmy-winning show stars Rachel Brosnahan as the charming Mrs. Maisel — a Jewish housewife with a perfect life on Manhattan’s Upper West Side who impulsively decided to become a stand-up comedian after her husband Joel Maisel (Michael Zegen) left her.
The first three seasons were spectacular, with sets and costumes beautifully reminiscent of the 1950s, hilarious characters played by an amazingly talented cast, and humor that had viewers clutching their sides. Unfortunately, the fourth season lost a lot of momentum. Midge flailed after losing the gig of her dreams, while various side plots featuring less likable characters spun around in circles. By the end of the season not much had really happened other than Midge’s long-awaited lover’s tryst with real-life comedian Lenny Bruce, brought to life on the fictional show by Luke Kirby.
Given that this is the final season and the end of Mrs. Maisel’s story, writers interestingly chose to set the opening scene around 20 years into the future, giving viewers a glimpse into Midge’s later years. The episode opens with Midge’s daughter Esther (Alexandra Socha) — all grown up and working as a doctoral researcher at our very own Harvard — ranting to her therapist about her mother.
Following this glimpse of Esther, who has the same frenetic energy and whip-fast intelligence as her mother, viewers witness the direct fallout of Midge’s encounter with Lenny as the episode picks up right where Season 4 left off. Viewers can only hope that Midge’s career will see more success than the last season, and luckily that seems to be the case. After undergoing another transformative experience, Midge finally seems to be back on the right path.
While the titular character recovers from her hypothermia scare, Susie makes some calls, seeing that her client is in a vulnerable state and needs a gig before she loses faith in herself. Borstein is a show-stealer as ever as Midge’s jaded New Yorker agent, and viewers will especially enjoy her interactions with Rose Weissman (Marin Hinkle), Midge’s elegant, neurotic mother.
The actors’ stellar performances were supplemented by the beautifully vibrant sets. A busy deli with bright red booths and colorful blue finishings frames the banter between restaurant patrons. Snow flurries amid a Christmas tree farm create a pristine winter wonderland at odds with a fiery argument between Susie and a prospective employer. An airport with white walls and red carpeting provides the backdrop for Midge’s stilted last encounter with Lenny, a poignant moment that also featured subtle yet moving performances from Brosnahan and Kirby. This episode utterly excelled at producing sets and cinematography that juxtaposed and complemented the respective dialogue.
Stand out moments include a dinner scene between Joel and Midge’s family with great comedic timing — Joel’s parents are hilarious as always, although their characters often toe the line of Jewish caricature. Tony Shalhoub also remains wonderfully endearing as Midge’s cerebral, bumbling father. The Maisel kids received more screen time throughout the episode, which feels fitting as Midge’s children start to age and become characters of their own.
Despite this, several writing decisions felt slightly bizarre, like when Moishe and Shirley suddenly announce their divorce at the aforementioned dinner. While most of the comedy throughout serves the story — quite literally, as Midge is a stand-up comic — the plot suffers when the story is twisted for the sake of a cheap laugh, which is exactly what the divorce gag felt like.
Other strange plot choices emerge with Joel’s storyline. First, his girlfriend Mei (Stephanie Hsu) abruptly leaves him, despite their romance being carefully built up since Season 3. It all feels too convenient, and frankly another example of the writers leaning into stereotypes as the only Asian character chooses a career as a doctor over a future with the man she loves, a choice that surprised Hsu herself.
After Mei leaves him, Joel does an uncomfortable, drunken stand-up bit in a warped parallel to Midge’s spectacularly spontaneous bit in the very first episode of the show that propelled her into her new career. Despite Mei’s rejection perhaps garnering him some sympathy, this painful scene may cause viewers to wonder if the writers are trying to make Joel Maisel as unlikable as possible.
The rest of the episode is saved by a great final scene, featuring a classic Midge stand-up bit and an exciting new job prospect. Although viewers may be tired of the show’s cyclical pattern where Midge gets a big break, screws up, and bounces back, hopefully she maintains an upward trajectory this season. While whether that means finding love or achieving fame remains to be seen, the show would benefit from any major plot development in place of the obstacles of the last few seasons that leave Midge right where she started. The last season may have left audiences with a few qualms, but the premiere proved that “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” should not be written off yet, promising much in store for an exciting season.

Two rising hip-hop stars, Micah Write from Jersey City and Smokeintheye from Rockland County, N.Y., are together as a duo paving their way to the forefront with their unique sound and unwavering dedication to the craft. As part of the underground scene, they're resurrecting the essence of real hip-hop, offering a breath of fresh air to listeners yearning for authenticity.
The duo first crossed paths online, bonding over their shared passion for hip-hop and complementary styles. This connection allowed them to forge a strong bond despite the geographical distance between them, eventually leading to the creation of their joint album “Live Many Times, Die Many Times.”
Micah Write and Smokeintheye draw their influences from various sources, including Westside Gunn and Griselda Records, which brought the classic hip-hop sound back into the mainstream.
“Westside Gunn and Griselda, Rome Streetz, they took this sound to a whole other level,” Smokeintheye said.
This revival of the old-school New York rap sound has inspired them to create music that resonates with the underground scene while simultaneously breaking through to a broader audience.
Both artists believe they are part of a larger movement, one that's making waves in the industry and challenging the mainstream. According to the duo, the underground scene they identify with include the likes of ANKHLEJOHN, al.divino, Estee Nack, Rome Streetz, and Pro Dillinger, who also hails from Rockland County.
“It’s like we're coming up from the underground now,” Smokeintheye said.
The duo’s journey gained momentum when they met the photographer 1000WORD$ at a performance in Brooklyn.
“He came up to me after the performance and showed love,” Write said. “Which was cool in itself.” However, the interaction didn’t stop there. “He tapped in and he offered us a couple of shows. You know he did a lot for us” This connection provided the duo with opportunities to perform and grow their fan base, solidifying their place in the underground scene.
Write emphasized a sense of unity and professionalism within the scene as something both artists appreciate.
“I have yet to see any real drama that's toxic and harmful to the culture and the scene as a whole,” Write said. “Everybody's making a conscious effort to keep it that way.”
In a time where the mainstream can often feel disconnected from the roots of hip-hop, Micah Write and Smokeintheye serve as a powerful reminder of the genre's rich history and potential for growth. As they forge ahead, their passion and creativity will undoubtedly continue to inspire the next generation of hip-hop artists.
As for their future endeavors, Micah Write and Smokeintheye are currently working on individual projects with producer skunkp32, while continuing to develop their sound as a duo.
“We want to build our own thing that's unique to us,” Write said. “And take our time with it, to give people something with substance.”
With their unwavering dedication to the craft and passion for real hip-hop, Micah Write and Smokeintheye are undoubtedly set to make a lasting impact on the industry. As they continue to rise from the underground, they carry with them the spirit of the hip-hop renaissance, a testament to their commitment and talent.

1. “Ivy” by Frank Ocean
It’s Frank Ocean. And more than that, it’s guaranteed to make you remember all of the beautiful things you experienced with your ex while simultaneously making you question why you ever let yourself waste your time with them in the first place. Im “Ivy,” “I love you” and “I hate you” find a perfect equilibrium. This is a great song for when you’ve accepted that these feelings will have to coexist.
2. “Don’t You Remember” by Adele
Any list of breakup ballads would be incomplete without a contribution from the ballad queen, Adele. It’s difficult to choose just one, but “Don’t You Remember” certainly deserves a spot amongst the best of them. This track showcases Adele’s soaring, gritty vocals as she reflects on a heartbreak marred by a lack of closure and painful memories. Also, bonus points for a tense bridge that releases into an explosive final chorus. And if your breakup doesn’t have you feeling down enough yet, you can also take the time to think about the fact that Adele produced this absolutely amazing song (and album) at age 21 — just to add some insult to your injury.
3. “Pretty Little Birds” by SZA feat. Isaiah Rashad
This song is rich with themes of love, uncertainty, fatigue, and a little hatred — just like you were when you first started the relationship, and probably also when it ended. “Pretty Little Birds” suggests the importance of trying to fly in love despite the fear of falling. The soft vocals and the smooth instrumental make this song so comforting it’s like SZA and Rashad are right there with you.
4. “Silver Springs” by Fleetwood Mac, Live in Burbank 1997
This one is for acknowledging and releasing some latent grievances. The original 1976 recording of this song absolutely pales in comparison to Fleetwood Mac’s live reunion album recording in 1997. The song utilizes mystical imagery and sound for a great deal of the track, but the real highlight is the build that begins at 3:34: The music swells as Nicks cries “Was I just a fool?” and “Give me just a chance.” The tension between her and her ex, Lindsey Buckingham, is palpable — even twenty years after their breakup — as she sings about their past possibilities. Unfortunately, this record reminds you that you just might not ever get over your ex.
5. “Will He” by Joji
The prettiest combination of jealousy, possessiveness, and altruism. “Will He” has some of the best lyrics of any Joji song, and they’re all about comparing himself with his lover’s future man. Do you remember a time when Joji was happy? How about when his music made you feel happy? Exactly. This is the perfect song to cry to until you feel just the right amount of empty.
6. “Linger” by The Cranberries 
“Linger” is a wistful, flowing track that engages with some feelings of hurt but is primarily dominated by pleasurable themes of lingering (see what we did there), infatuation, and attachment. Against her better judgment, Dolores O’Riordan sings about the dreamy, irrational experience of falling in love with a person who — as it turned out — didn’t love her back. This one is for your “main character moment” as you romanticize your own misfortune.
7. “I. Flight of the Navigator” by Childish Gambino
You know you miss them, and despite your better judgment, a part of you wishes you could go back. This song is about longing for peace and connectedness in a relationship, and about comforting someone when you realize how difficult this is to obtain. Whether it’s because of the beauty that is the pairing of Gambino and an elysian chord progression, or because of the way the lyrics pluck your heartstrings, tears are a guarantee.
8. “Motion Sickness” by Phoebe Bridgers
Aside from the relevant lyrics, this one just has a satisfying mix of numbness and anger. On one hand, Bridgers’s airy voice over the groovy beat creates the impression of an understated, calm track. On the other hand, she manages to convey surprising grit and frustration through her breathy vocals; the bridge in particular features a signature Bridgers scream-adjacent moment that is cathartic in its emotional release.
9. “Roses” by Outkast
This is definitely a song for when you’re all the way over it… Well, maybe not all the way. It still stings a little, but you can make jokes about it and convince yourself you never liked them that much anyway. Like the majority of Outkast songs and, again, probably like you at this stage, this one is super upbeat and catchy, but the lyrics remain sad if you pay enough attention.
10. “Drunk Walk Home” by Mitski
“Drunk Walk Home” contains only two verses, and as such is subject to various interpretations. The good thing, however, is that one of these readings alludes to a breakup. This is perhaps the most unhinged song in Mitski’s entire discography, and as such is a fantastic partner in reckoning with one’s confusing and unpleasant feelings. “Drunk Walk Home” is for channeling all of your woes into heavy electric guitars, drumming, and scream-yelling vocals for approximately two minutes straight.
11. “All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)” by Taylor Swift
“All Too Well” is an undeniable fan-favorite of Swift’s breakup ballads. Upon the re-release of her “Red” album, Swift extended the song to 10 minutes with the uncut original lyrics. She wrote the song during a break from a rehearsal on her Speak Now WorldTour amid processing her own breakup. From the exciting beginning of a relationship to the heart-wrenching confusion surrounding a separation, this song captures rich storytelling that ultimately feels relatable to some element of anyone’s relationship. It also includes countless striking lyrics to keep you crying for all 10 minutes, including quotes like, “so casually cruel in the name of being honest,” or, “you kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath.”
12. That Don’t Impress Me Much by Shania Twain
This one’s for when you want to tell them off, but in a low-key way. Twain describes someone who feels superior, maybe has a fancy job or good looks, or maybe is Brad Pitt. Still, she so satisfyingly dismisses them because those superficial qualities don’t translate to a relationship. The song is a reminder to not allow someone’s looks, achievements, or accolades to overshadow what you deserve.

Money talks, wealth whispers.
No show embodies this adage better than HBO’s “Succession,” with expansive Manhattan penthouses and dazzling superyachts serving as the backdrop for the lives of the wealthy Roy family. The most notable display of the family’s wealth, though, is their fashion, with the clothing of each character telling a nuanced story of what they wish to present to the world, and what they’d rather try to hide.
As Kendall (Jeremy Strong) states bluntly in the show’s most recent episode, he’s “already rich.” With nothing to prove in regard to wealth, he often dresses in simple well-fitting suits, complete with a $600 cashmere Loro Piana baseball cap or chunky pair of Valentino Garavani sneakers to show off his pseudo-edgy hip-hop-loving side (cue his infamous L to the OG rap).
His outfits demonstrate the trademark quiet luxury style of “Succession”: timeless, high-quality, well-tailored pieces with a sophisticated yet understated essence. Neutral tones and expensive materials reign supreme in this subtle display of wealth, rather than the recognizable logos and eye-catching jewelry that are typically donned by the rich.
The fashion of the other Roy children similarly conveys aspects of their characters. Shiv (Sarah Snook)’s transition from soft silhouettes and jewel-toned knits at the beginning of the series to cooler colors and sharper pantsuits by Season Two parallels her descent into the trappings of the Waystar Royco family drama. Roman (Kieran Culkin) dresses in suits without ties, demonstrating the illusion of carelessness he tries so hard to cultivate.
Common signifiers of wealth like fancy cars, expensive coats, and luxury handbags are also notably absent from the show. The Roys don’t drive, they are driven, so they have no need for a personal car, and with mere seconds spent walking between their office, car, and private jet, the characters don’t experience enough of the elements to merit a winter coat. Likewise, assistants hold onto any important items for them, so bags and purses are unnecessary, if not actively discouraged, for the characters. These counterintuitive details are so accurately portrayed due to advice from the show’s very own team of wealth consultants, a role revealed by Culkin in an interview with fellow actor Dan Levy.
When Greg (Nicholas Braun)’s date violates these unspoken rules in the recent Season Four premiere episode, she is mercilessly ridiculed by Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) for her “ludicrously capacious bag” that Tom posits is large enough to hold both a lunch pail and shoes to wear on the subway — two experiences laughably beneath the echelon of the Roys.
Notably, Tom is the individual to raise this faux pas not only because he has learned the rules of wealthy society in his quest to join the ranks of the Roy family, but also because he is one of the few characters insecure enough to comment on others’ fashion shortcomings. The journey of the interloper Tom is best tracked through his fashion evolution throughout the series.
“Here’s the thing about being rich,” the nouveau riche Tom tells Roy-adjacent cousin Greg back in Season One. “It’s fucking great. It’s like being a superhero, only better.… You get to wear a costume, but it’s designed by Armani, and it doesn’t make you look like a prick.” If any of the real Roys heard this statement, they’d ridicule Tom immediately. Teeming with effort, his fragile ego betrays him. He wears flashy Italian suits and overstated designer brands, puffy vests and unblemished shoes, all of which demonstrate Tom’s tremendous desire to appear rich.
Unfortunately, this desire is precisely what exposes Tom as an outsider. Roman approaches him in Season Two, casually dropping the devastating line: “Nice vest, Wambsgans. It's so puffy. What's it stuffed with, your hopes and dreams?”
What Roman is getting at, and what the entire quiet luxury trend truly implies, is that effort isn’t cool. The truly wealthy don’t care about the conspicuous consumption of interlopers and social climbers. Having the security and the confidence to put in no effort at all — or at least exercise one’s wealth with a bit more subtlety — is what sets the insiders apart from the rest. This balance is what the Roy children were born knowing, and what the phonies fail to pick up on.
Ultimately the fashion of “Succession” tells a story: who fits in, who doesn’t, and who’s trying their hardest to claw their way to the top of the heap.

After Criticism Over Roth Veto, HKS Dean Elmendorf Stresses Importance of Discussing Difficult Issues
As a documentarian, writer, and the host of the web series “Instant Vintage,” Tyron de Harlem is a journalist driven by his mission to preserve the history and culture of hip-hop, while showcasing the talents of its most innovative artists.
Born and raised in Harlem, New York, de Harlem grew up surrounded by music in the St. Nicholas Projects. “There was a park at the back of my building and there would be a lot of times when I heard loud music,” de Harlem said. “Oftentimes, it would end prematurely because gunshots would break out and shit like that, but I just looked forward to those times when a DJ pulled up with a sound system and played records.”
Although he had friends that rapped and made music, de Harlem gravitated towards journalism as his way to participate in hip-hop, inspired by his childhood collection of classic hip-hop magazines like “XXL” and “The Source.” de Harlem said that he found his calling as a journalist after finishing his formal schooling.
“My teachers used to always encourage me to write, but I ain’t really want to write about schoolwork,” de Harlem said. “Years later, when I figured out more about who I was and what I wanted to do, I just started seeking out artists that I respected or whose work made me feel something.”
De Harlem has since turned his love for hip-hop into a career in documenting the genre. He began writing about the culture and interviewing artists, eventually transitioning into video production. His web series “Instant Vintage” is a testament to his dedication to preserving the history and legacy of hip-hop. The series is the companion interview segment to the online “Off Top” freestyle series hosted by Hoboken streetwear store Top Shelf Premium.
The show is an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at the lives of some of hip-hop’s most innovative artists. Each season features interviews with a diverse mix of artists, producers, and industry insiders, showcasing the vast spectrum of talent within the genre. Season One included appearances by Willie the Kid, V Don, Buck Dudley and Billie Essco, while the upcoming season two promises interviews with Fatboi Sharif, Roper Williams, BoriRock, and MichaelAngelo.
De Harlem’s goal with “Instant Vintage” is to highlight the genre in a tasteful, respectful manner — focusing on the intricate storytelling and technical skills of the artists. He aims to counteract the clickbait nature of modern media and celebrate the brilliance of those who contribute to hip-hop, as he has strived to do his whole career.
De Harlem was one of the first journalists to cover the early music of Westside Gunn and Griselda Records. The journalist shared that what initially drew him to Griselda was their ability to transport listeners to Buffalo. “My favorite thing about rap is when you hear a project from a place that you’re not from, and you feel like it’s taking you there, like traveling via the music,” de Harlem said.
De Harlem interviewed the then relatively unknown Buffalo rap group at a studio on the Upper East Side in June 2015. “I thought I was just gonna interview [Westside Gunn], but he pulled up with Camouflage Monk, he pulled up with Daringer, he pulled up with Conway, and Mach-Hommy was there,” the journalist said.
His 2015 Griselda interview laid the groundwork for an eventual collaborative relationship with Mach-Hommy. The pair reconnected after the New Jersey rapper released his 2016 album “HBO.”
“It’s always on his terms, when he’s ready he’ll throw up the Bat signal,” he said. “That day I first met him, I thought he was standoffish, but he was just being himself.”
After his first interview with Mach Hommy, de Harlem eventually became the go-to journalist for the enigmatic artist and his rapping partner Tha God Fahim. The journalist recently appeared in a picture that documented a meeting between Fahim, producer Nicholas Craven, and Jay-Z.
As a documentarian, Tyron continues to educate himself on new artists and stay informed on the ever-evolving hip-hop landscape. De Harlem shared that he has recently been listening to a mix of both rap and pop music, enjoying the works of Detroit rapper Bruiser Wolf and LA artist G Perico. “It’s really about just tapping in with the people who are as enthusiastic about the music as I am,” de Harlem said.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of hip-hop, a landmark achievement for Black artists and creatives that have helped develop the most popular genre in the contemporary U.S. While the artists that dominate Spotify charts and headline shows often act as the current faces of the genre, it feels necessary to highlight some of hip hop’s greatest producers throughout each era in order to celebrate it to the fullest.
Hip-hop music began as an innovative mix of soul, funk, and disco music when South Bronx DJs like DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash would use turntables to mix songs into a new party sound. Kool Herc would use a technique he called “The Merry Go Round,” which could strip down tracks to their breakbeat and string the beats together to create non-stop dancing at his local parties. As breakdancing on cardboard boxes turned into playing sets at the Latin Quarter, the genre rose across boroughs, the East Coast, and later, the world.
Here is a list of some of hip-hop’s greatest minds and how their producing techniques have pushed hip-hop forward in the years since Kool Herc’s Bronx Debut.
Old School (1979 - 1984)
Old school hip hop was made for dancing. With a simple beat, a funky bass line, and a sample, the sounds of old school made way for b-boying culture, where b-boys and b-girls would develop new dance moves to extended breaks in the music. The era paved the way for many of the techniques and technologies that would establish the genre in the future.
Marley Marl
Marlon Williams, also known as Marley Marl, is an American DJ considered to be one of hip-hop’s first superproducers. He is best known for mastering the art of sampling, or transferring snippets of songs from vinyl records into drum machines. As the man who created the magic behind favorite hits from Eric B. & Rakim, the late Biz Markie, Big Daddy Kane, and LL Cool J, Marl helped truly shape the genre as it’s known today.
Rick Rubin
Although he’s the only white producer on the list, Rick Rubin undeniably helped make hip-hop what it is today. He’s soft-spoken, meditative, and often barefoot, but grew up listening to punk and rock music and became a hip-hop fan in his college years at NYU. Alongside now media mogul Russell Simmons, he co-founded Def Jam Records in 1984, the label which went on to sign LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, and Run-D.M.C.
Golden Age (1984 - 1997)
The Golden Age elevated the unique sound of rap music and scratching techniques. Hip-hop became a canvas for young producers and helped develop legendary creative relationships within the rap industry. The genre began to expand outside of its East Coast roots and brought young nationwide talent to the forefront of the scene.
Dr. Dre
Everyone knows his name. Dr. Dre founded N.W.A. along with Eazy-E and Ice Cube in 1986, laying a foundation for the gangsta rap movement. Not only does Dre have an unbeatable ear for talent — producing music for a star-studded list including Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Kendrick Lamar, and 2Pac — he also had an incredible influence on hip-hop culture. Beats by Dre headphones impacted both the audio and fashion industries, creating a legacy that will stand the test of time.
DJ Premier
The Houston-born DJ Premier did not grow up hearing hip hop music, but rather soul music later informed his dynamic sampling techniques. Premier has been a part of some of the most impactful albums in rap’s history including Nas’s “Illmatic” (1994), The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Ready to Die” (1994), and was half of the rap group Gang Starr alongside the late Guru. The two were a key part of the influx of street and socially conscious rappers of the ’90s.
Bling Era (1997 - 2006)
The bling era introduced hip hop to the mainstream, with popular new sounds like neo-soul and R&B. Rap lyrics were braggadocious and money-oriented, as rappers found themselves in an era of extreme chart-topping success. The era might be defined as one of constant flexing and one-upping, where the ultimate goal was to have the nicest car or the biggest chain.
Mannie Fresh
At 15, taking inspiration from his father, DJ Sabu, Mannie Fresh became the DJ for New Orleans hip hop crew New York Incorporated. Fresh began producing his own tracks with the inclusion of live drum machines into his sets. He is credited as the master behind the sound of Cash Money Records, which he left in 2005 due to financial and legal issues. Still, hits like Juvenile’s “Back That Azz Up” (1999) and Lil Wayne’s “Go DJ” (2004) showcase his legendary skill.
Timbaland
While his career began in the late ’80s as “DJ Timmy Tim,” producing is where Timbaland found his footing. Bringing Southern sounds into hip hop, he was a frequent collaborator of Missy Elliot, helping to write and produce five of her albums. Outside of their partnership, Timbaland produced hits like “Big Pimpin” (feat. UGK) by Jay Z, “Pony” by Ginuwine, and “Cry Me a River” by Justin Timberlake. Without him, the pop and hip-hop worlds could never have fused together so seamlessly.
Streaming Era (2006 - Present)
In a post-Y2K world, music-sharing websites like Napster (featured in David Fincher’s “The Social Network”) introduced more techniques for streaming new music. As streaming rose in popularity, young artists across the world were able to share their music with free and user-friendly apps like SoundCloud. The digital world has allowed young, passionate producers to make their mark in a more accessible way than rap’s former giants.
Metro Boomin
You can’t listen to trap music without being in constant awe of the artistry of Atlanta-based Leland Tyler Wayne, professionally known as Metro Boomin. As a seven-year-old in love with rap music, he decided to become a producer with the hopes of having his mother take him seriously. Today, both he, and his well-known producer tag — “If Young Metro don’t trust you, I’m gon’ shoot you” — are well known and collaborations with big names like Post Malone, Future, 21 Savage, and Travis Scott prove that he’s the guy everybody wants on their team.
Boi 1da
Jamaican-Canadian producer Boi 1da, names Dr Dre, Pharrell, and Timbaland as his top three inspirations. Although he left Jamaica for Toronto at the age of three, the influence of the island lives on through his work. His synth pad-based beats have brought millions of feet to the dancefloor with hits like Rihanna’s “Work” (2016) and “God’s Plan” (2018) by Drake. With four nominations at this year’s Grammy Awards, 1da uses the creative and unorthodox to keep hip-hop fresh.
Underrepresented Producers
Although varying in region and sound, each of these producers has demonstrated a craftsmanship for creating music and a passion to push the boundaries. They reference anything from James Brown to Japanese Instrumentals and use their creative rolodex to engage listeners in story.
The Neptunes
While many know Pharrell for his pop hits like “Happy” or “Frontin’,” his roots in hip-hop run deep. When the two were in high school, Pharrel befriended fellow musician Chad Hugo and they were later scouted at their high school talent show. The two were a writing and production duo, producing hits like “Hot In Herre” by Nelly and Snoop Dogg’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot,” which Pharell himself is featured on. Many classic 2000s hits were either created by the Neptunes or a direct result of their influence.
J Dilla
The late Detroit native is responsible for some of the most creative sampling used in hip-hop. Instead of just using beats and melodies from the disco and funk tracks he was obsessed with as a child, Dilla would keep the vocals from the tracks he sampled and create an entirely new sound. His techniques revolutionized the MPC3000, a beat sampler, and sequencer, and his limited edition version is currently held in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture’s collection.
Hip-hop would not be where it is today without the creative genius and wise ears of the producers behind the music. As the industry reflects on 50 years of the genre, it is important to thank those who poured their talent into the breaks, beats, and scratches that define the music industry.

At the heart of the underground Los Angeles music scene lies Green Tea Studios, a premier recording studio based out of Santa Monica known for attracting rising artists. The CEO behind the studio’s success, Barry Rosenblum, has cultivated an environment that not only caters to established artists but also fosters the growth and development of up-and-coming talent.
From a young age, Rosenblum had a passion for music that would eventually lay the foundation for his career. He was a drummer in his teens and had a brief career as a rapper under the name Ursa The Chef. This early immersion in music drove him to open Green Tea Studios with his business partner Yoni Greentea, where he could combine his love for the craft with his entrepreneurial spirit.
Green Tea Studios prides itself on providing state-of-the-art facilities and equipment for its clients. However, it is Rosenblum's leadership and commitment to nurturing new talent that sets the studio apart from others. One of the ways that he fosters this environment is by hosting an open mic event called “Tea Time.” The event is an offshoot of “Sunday Sounds,” Green Tea Studios’s monthly concert series that features rising talent. “It’s an open mic,” he said. “For the first one we basically did first come first serve which was a mistake, and the line was absolutely nuts.” Rosenblum explained that the open-mic event aims to create a platform for fresh talent.
Rosenblum explains that his studio's success is also due to the variety of talent that comes through its doors, including both well-known and rising stars. “There were some really talented ones and then there are ones that are still sort of forming their sound, but they deserved their shine, too,” he said. Green Tea Studio’s inclusive atmosphere creates a diverse and vibrant music community that thrives under Rosenblum's leadership.
Apart from hosting open mic events and working directly with new artists, Rosenblum also seeks to grow the local music community by offering lessons in audio engineering. Green Tea Studios provides lessons at $70 an hour, giving aspiring sound engineers the opportunity to learn from professionals in the field. This educational component further demonstrates Rosenblum's commitment to fostering growth and development in the industry.
Under Rosenblum’s leadership, Green Tea Studios has become more than just a place for musicians to record their music. It has evolved into a hub for creativity and growth, where artists can receive the support and guidance they need to succeed in the competitive world of music. As the owner of the studio, Rosenblum is responsible for fostering this environment, and his passion for music is evident in every aspect of the studio's operations.
Rosenblum’s leadership at Green Tea Studios has been instrumental in its success as a premier recording facility in Los Angeles. More important than founding a successful music studio, Rosenblum has created a welcoming environment for artists to record and collaborate, saying, “I truly believe in the power of music to change lives.”

From his Harlem roots to collaborations with some of the most respected rappers in the game, V Don has cemented his status as a key architect of the modern East Coast underground hip-hop scene. By staying true to his style and prioritizing organic connections with artists, V Don has become one of the most sought-after producers in the Northeast.
V Don started his journey into music production at the age of 19. He first began making beats on PlayStation and FL Studio. The producer shared that his family had encouraged him to make music as a child. However, V Don did not seriously pursue producing until he moved to Richmond, Va. during his last year of high school.
“My father had all the hardware quickly and he would try to show me and my cousin early on how to do it, but we wasn't interested back then,” V Don said. “When I got older and I moved down South, I had a lot of time on my hands, so I had to get into something and music was it.”
Influenced by the music of legendary producers like The Alchemist, Just Blaze, and Swizz Beatz, V Don was drawn to their timeless sound early in his career. “They make classic records that I could play forever. They made records that I was playing when I was a young kid,” V Don said. “I can still play it to this day. It’s great.”
V Don’s work with the likes of Eto, Ransom, Estee Nack has established him as one of the most talented underground hip-hop producers on the East Coast. His beats recall the classic hip-hop essence of the producers he grew up idolizing, while simultaneously updating the sound for a new generation of listeners.
Embracing his authentic hip-hop style, V Don never stopped working on his underground sound, even when others questioned it. “Back then people used to be like, ‘Why are you still making this sound?,’” V Don said. “I wanted to have my own identity.”
The producer’s insistence on staying true to his vision paid off, yielding collaborations with charting artists like A$AP Rocky. Speaking about his work with A$AP Rocky, V Don recalls the moment he met the rapper before his career took off: “I believed in him because he was different.” This collaboration led to a platinum plaque for his work on “Ghetto Symphony” off of A$AP Rocky's album, “Long Live A$AP.”
V Don’s contribution to the album not only earned him recognition but also fueled his desire to create even more outstanding music. His work has taken him all over the U.S. and more recently, to Paris for a show with Lord Apex.
While V Don’s relationships with artists have evolved over the years, his focus remains the same: making music that he enjoys first and foremost. “I have to enjoy it first before I let anybody else hear it,” he explained. “So I’m doing what I like to do. I love that sound.”
V Don’s approach to collaborating with new artists is straightforward, often driven by a single record. “Usually it’s like once we do one or two records, the mood is like, if we do one song and it’s crazy, we can't just keep it right here,” the producer said. “We got to put a whole plate together.” This method led to his multiple collaborations with Willie the Kid and their “Deutsche Marks” album trilogy.
His recent project with Estee Nack, titled “Born Rewards & Penalties” or “BRAP!,” is a shining example of V Don’s commitment to nurturing authentic connections. After being introduced to the rapper's music by a friend, V Don reached out and the two began working together without ever meeting in person. The duo found instant chemistry, leading to the creation of “BRAP!,” a full-length project that showcases their combined talents. “We’ve been done with this album since the middle of last year, but we were just saving it for the right time,” V Don said.
With a busy schedule and more projects in the pipeline, including collaborations with Eto, Ransom, and Bronx rap crew Heist Life, V Don is showing no signs of slowing down. “I’m tryna drop a project every month of this year,” the producer said.

After Criticism Over Roth Veto, HKS Dean Elmendorf Stresses Importance of Discussing Difficult Issues
The following review will be about “La La Land.”
Wait — I actually meant “Moonlight.” Sorry, I had to do it to you!
In any case, it is not easy to forget the “Best Picture” blunder of the 2016 Oscars, and it was here that I first heard about “Moonlight.” Written and directed by Barry Jenkins, this A24 film remained on my watchlist for the longest time before I finally sat down recently to watch it.
The first thing that struck me is that this is certainly an A24 film, and by that, I mean it shares the same artistic style and contemporary themes that many movies from this production company boast. “Moonlight” shone in its artfulness. The camera does a commendable job of capturing the Miami landscape that Chiron (Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, Trevante Rhodes), the protagonist, inhabits: The Cinematography makes sure to highlight the tough — like the abandoned housing projects — but also the soft — like the oceanfront. The story is rooted heavily in a sense of place, so this effective portrayal is particularly important. The shots themselves are rather slow and contemplative, allowing the viewer to sit in and immerse themself in the setting. And of course, the division of the film into three acts — each of which follows Chiron at a different stage in his life — is clever and enormously compelling.
My problem with “Moonlight,” however, is that I felt unsatiated at its close: Although the final shot of a young Chiron basked in moonlight upon the water is stunning, I realized that I still felt figuratively hungry. But why? The film depicts an important subject matter and seemed to be in competent hands, yet I couldn't shake the feeling that “Moonlight” ultimately was just good when it had the potential to be great.
The core issue seems to be that the film relies too heavily on its visuals, which leaves the writing and story underdeveloped. Nearly all of the characters and their dynamics with Chiron are very compelling and call for further exploration, but the film quells their potential before they have any substantive time to bud. Juan (Mahershala Ali), for instance, enters Chiron’s life in Act I and begins to step into a father-figure role for him. Furthermore, the film dips a toe into the water of exploring what it means for Juan to be Chiron’s mentor but also involved in the supply chain that feeds Chiron’s mother’s narcotics addiction. By Act II, however, it is matter-of-factly mentioned that Juan has passed away. Juan’s partner, Teresa (Janelle Monáe), is another figure whose role in Chiron’s life is only briefly discussed, and following Juan’s death, she virtually disappears as well.
Even for the characters that do last until Act III, their relationships with Chiron are not developed to their fullest potential. Chiron’s mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), is a tremendously interesting character. She begins the film being portrayed as a quite neglectful parent struggling very severely with addiction. There was ample room to elaborate on her story — perhaps more about her positionality as a single mother, her experiences with poverty, or her attempts to provide for a child while struggling with her own multiplicity of problems. Instead, she is mainly portrayed manipulating or abusing Chiron in Acts I and II; Act III then jumps to showing her many years later, clean and rather remorseful about the past. What happened in between?
Chiron’s relationship with Kevin (Jaden Piner, Jharrel Jerome, André Holland) is similar in that Kevin occupies the simultaneous position of Chiron’s romantic interest but also humiliator — a role that is complex, but whose complexity is not heeded properly. The boys have a confusing and undefined relationship, but by the end viewers are supposed to root for them to be together. I’m not entirely opposed to this concept, but I needed to be convinced along the way that I should believe and invest in their attraction/romance/love — which I was did not. The film virtually doesn’t discuss Chiron’s relationship with his own sexuality at all, and thus leaves no room for viewers to witness any personal and emotional growth or maturation he may experience as he moves through life.
Part of this is likely due to Chiron’s nature as a quiet and passive character. He is virtually silent for the better parts of Acts I and II, which is not inherently a negative trait, but does make it difficult for a viewer to understand his thoughts and feelings. Alternatively, these could have been expressed through Chiron’s behavior, but — as he is a passive character to whom things happen, rather than who is active in his surroundings — this also does not happen. Then, as his adult self, Chiron presents very differently — he is living in Atlanta, appears well-positioned in the local drug supply network, and seems well-off financially — as evidenced by his vintage Chevrolet Impala. He also visits his mother at her rehab facility, where they reflect on his youth and upbringing. There were some interesting conversations to be had here about Chiron’s personal and emotional development in relation to his mother and his native community, but once again, the path to this point is hazy.
Overall, I can see the vision for this film. It does what Hollywood needs: It elevates stories of intersectionality and marginalization, and does so in a way that feels authentic and raw. This is also attributable to its nature as a semi-biographical work, based on the experiences of both the original playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (author of unpublished play “In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue”) and screenwriter Barry Jenkins during their own youths growing up in Chiron’s Miami neighborhood. The issue arises, however, when the story itself begins to feel half-baked. At times, the film is absolutely captivating — like the “Middle of the World” scene where Juan is teaching a young Chiron to swim. Here, everything from the score to the symbolism to the camerawork is flawless. At other times, though, the film feels more like a rough draft than a polished product worthy of the Oscar for “Best Picture” (although, maybe my knowledge of its accolades caused me to have unreasonably high expectations). Keeping all else constant, narrowing the scope of the plot could have allowed “Moonlight” to exercise its fullest potential: depicting richer, more nuanced dynamics and taking an already enjoyable movie to unbelievable heights.

Verona
Been thinking a lot about orange and blue.
Sun on brick and cerulean skies. How you’d see it
and from what vantage point. It’s feeling like
Romeo and Juliet, these days, all wilting iris petals,
damp scent of moss in the air, twilight, & I can feel
love waning, just like those two heady imbeciles,
clutching poison and knives and each other’s hands.
Your hand was always cold in mine. It was like
you were sick, already dead, as sun sinks below brick
and I can barely conjure an image of its face.
Sometimes when I’ve grown too tired I make wishes
I know I cannot back. On the cobblestone street
I’d be a girl, if I could do it again, flowing midi dress
in dark hues with the flowers on it. I’d do my hair up
with the strands that frame my face and I’d look
the boy in the gym-shorts in the eye and
he’d look back. We’d love each other.
Then I’d grow and I’d never veer onto this track
I’m on. Parallel lives, and separate.
Unscented, like cotton or old detergent. The world
caught in this twilight, the dying sun’s fingers clenched
in a death grip, in the living room the television blaring
in SD, pixels and warped saturation. I bake
a lemon cake. I put it on the nice cake stand,
the one my mother gifted me for a birthday.
Then here it is again—sharp air, pines in the dark green night
hitting the back of my throat, my fingers sticky with it.
What I didn’t know back then. I didn’t know.
Manhunt
The plaster walls grow clammy, sweat
or spit. From my corner window I look out
on the street. Cropped hedges and a blond boy, crashing
a cafeteria tray over a gray ceramic bunny. Shards
scatter and pierce into the tires of a passing
car. The window ledge tips even though I have not
drank anything since last month, when I told you
I don’t know, I don’t know, and you facilitated
the conversation. I thought I might see you
tonight, but I can feel my hands—I know
you are not here. From room to room I walk, the fallen lover
of a Greek somebody, and you will not see it, no,
you are not here. At the back door I feed
sugar cereal to a mouth within a mouth. It uses
its fingers to pick morsels out of a rubber jaw,
places them between flesh and bone. A man who knows
how to cover his tracks spits out of a passenger seat window
and other men laugh. I say 20% of the words I can think of
and settle for the settlement. It is Sunday, now.
In a different window I could be ordering
a crepe with candied orange rinds or spinach or swiss.
In a different window I could be not fallen but
reborn, with an audience, a knack for speech.

As the annual sea of lanyard-adorned pre-frosh descended upon campus during Visitas this year, our Board was reminded of a perennial truth about the admitted students weekend and the university writ large: Harvard needs us.
More specifically, Harvard needs our clubs.
Come Visitas time, the Dean of Students Office inundates our inboxes with pleas to sign up to host admitted students in exchange for the right to recruit incoming first-years to our organizations. Without a wriggling mass of young clubs ready to be fed to the Big Bird that is the DSO, our University would be unable to put on its annual marketing extravaganza and Harvard’s yield rate might — God forbid — drop a few points.
Now, Big Bird has decided that it bit off more than it could chew: The DSO is considering a proposal to temporarily freeze the creation of new clubs, citing a shortage of resources to support student organizations at the richest university in the country.
As we’ve opined in the past, clubs powered by hardworking students are foundational to a Harvard education. Through our organizations, many of us find tight communities and develop lifelong skills that benefit us long after we graduate.
Which is why the plan being considered reeks of malpractice: If the club freeze goes into effect, our campus ecosystem is in trouble.
We can only hope that those admitted students hosted by members of this Editorial Board over Visitas did not overhear our loud grumblings about the harms of the proposed freeze — it would be such a shame if those smiling, enthusiastic pre-frosh were told that the club they once hoped to start would not be recognized by Harvard anytime soon.
In response to the DSO’s proposal to halt club creation, we have a counteroffer:
How about no?
Realistically, the DSO cannot stop students from gathering in association — it’s our First Amendment right, after all. And we’re not about to discard our ambitions just because the DSO is finding its job a little too challenging.
On a more serious note, while the club freeze can’t stop groups of students from meeting, it might discourage our peers from forming new clubs in a seriously harmful way, given the DSO’s ability to restrict room rental to officially recognized clubs. Many meaningful clubs on campus, including affinity spaces, were only created in the past few years — an influx that makes sense given that many clubs likely died during the Covid-19 pandemic. A freeze on club creation will potentially damage campus culture for everyone, especially underrepresented students.
We see this plan for what it is: a lazy attempt by the DSO to buy time to remedy their internal dysfunction.
A cursory glance at the DSO’s disorganized club database quickly reveals its incompetence. Despite a recent revamp, the website is unfriendly to users and is connected to infrequently updated email lists. Additionally, the website lists 587 student clubs, even though only 181 clubs submitted applications for HUA funding in Spring 2023, suggesting that the database itself is severely outdated.
In a year in which a club leader transferred $30,000 from her club’s bank account into her own seemingly without DSO repercussions, the proposed freeze strikes us as emblematic of misplaced priorities and institutional ineptitude: Big Bird needs to get its nest in order.
Instead of offering students financial training to prevent future five-figure mishaps, the DSO has dedicated its purportedly limited resources this year to ensuring that clubs include the phrases “Harvard College” and “Student(s)” or “Harvard Undergraduate” in their official names. We find it hard to believe that comically paternalistic decisions such as this were made with student wellbeing in mind, rather than to protect Harvard’s copyrighted image.
The DSO claims that the freeze is necessary because of a dearth of available resources. Even if the University can’t spare a few pennies from its overflowing coffers, we see an obvious untapped funding source: Make the Student Activities Fee mandatory while covering it with financial aid. With one small policy change, the DSO could enshrine the centrality of clubs to the Harvard experience and affirm their funding as an institutional priority.
Right now, we’re confident that the DSO will approve the DSO’s plan (funny how that works), and we’re broadly unimpressed with Big Bird’s performance this year. So in the meantime, here’s hoping Big Bird starts taking better care of its flock.

In 1951, while studying for a Greek exam at Fuller Seminary, William R. Bright had a revelation. He felt called to create a new ministry outside the traditional institution of the church, concerned with spreading the gospel to college students, and then the world.
With the help of his wife Vonette Z. Bright, William Bright conceived of Campus Crusade for Christ — now known as Cru in the United States — at the University of California, Los Angeles. Cru’s primarily evangelical purpose would be “winning people to faith in Jesus Christ, building them in their faith and sending them to win and build others.”
The ministry grew rapidly. Today, it is one of the most widely known “parachurches” — a typically evangelical ministry that operates outside the institutional bounds of a single church — in the United States.
Cru is one of many parachurches that flourished during the 1970s and 1980s. Others include Focus on the Family and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Together, these parachurches formed a powerful network over Southern California, spreading into the nation and beyond.
There are two — equally valid and equally important — lenses by which to read this growth: as a result of thousands authentically accepting the gospel into their lives, and as an undercover arm of the Republican Party. Both understandings carry important implications.
***
The contemporary coalition between evangelicalism and conservative Republicanism, in the mind of modern-day media and our collective imagination, is often associated with the South or rural pockets. Yet it is the stereotypically liberal enclave of Southern California that holds the hidden history of these powerful religious and political networks.
In 1972, Cru brought tens of thousands together in Dallas for Explo ’72, a “landmark conference” that featured “evangelism and discipleship training, contemporary music concerts, and lots of rain.”
For many students and young evangelicals in attendance, this was a huge celebration of faith. But there was another narrative present. As explained by Darren Dochuk in his book “From Bible Belt to Sunbelt:” “Explo ’72 was orchestrated by and for conservative Republicans as they prepared for the elections that fall.”
While not all parachurches started out in the Sunbelt, the 1970s saw the ‘southernization’ of “Southern California evangelicalism,” led by people like Bright and Reverend E.V. Hill, and sponsored by the well-known Billy Graham. The result: a robust, powerful political force that changed the face of American evangelicalism and the political landscape forever. According to Dochuk, entrepreneurial values honed within these ministries forged a “creative, centrist, youthful, colorblind conservatism.”
The Republican Party quickly grafted Cru onto its arm of conservative politics. Two years post-Explo ’72, Graham convinced then-President Richard Nixon’s advisers to seek a relationship with Bright “in hopes of using Campus Crusade to mobilize Christian collegians for the GOP.”
This was the political mobilization of what we now know as the Christian right. “We believe the life of our nation is at stake,” voiced local chapters of Cru and hundreds of other ministries. A moral universe for the evangelicals had been created in 1970s Southern California, and along with it, the urge to legislate such dogma.
This initial association of parachurches and the Republican Party continued into the 1980s with President Ronald Reagan. It’s hard to say which came first — the bottom-up acceptance of conservative tenets by the Southern California evangelicals or the top-down assertion of Republican values from political advisers and candidates — but the result brings us to today, with headlines like “Why ‘Evangelical’ Is Becoming Another Word for ‘Republican.’"
***
The term “parachurch” is not a familiar one to those outside of the evangelical world. For those within it, though, parachurches are everywhere. Cru, Christian Union, Reformed University Fellowship, Asian American Christian Fellowship, Young Life, the Navigators, Fellowship of Christian Athletes: These are all organizations that strive to spread the gospel and cultivate Christian community.
On face, the mission of a parachurch must not be inherently political. Under the same tax exempt 501(c)(3) status as churches and other religious organizations, they cannot lobby.
Yet some parachurches are especially skilled at placing themselves in positions of political influence. While they do not advocate directly for the United States to be a Christian nation, parachurches often imply that the nation will be made better under Christian values and politicians.
Take Capitol Ministries, which aims “to create disciples of Jesus Christ in the political arena throughout the world.” Founded in part by Ralph K. Drollinger, an avid Donald Trump supporter, and funded in part by “agribusiness kings,” according to Katherine Stewart in “The Power Worshippers,” Capitol Ministries held weekly Bible studies for lawmakers in 2018 that at times “included as many as eleven of fifteen cabinet secretaries.”
Similar ministries that attempt to reach the upper echelons of the U.S. government and beyond include the Fellowship Foundation and Well Versed — central to both are regular prayer gatherings and Bible studies among the most influential leaders in the world.
Christian Union, an evangelical ministry located specifically at Ivy League universities and Stanford University, takes a different approach. By “developing bold Christian leaders at the most strategic and profoundly influential universities in America,” Christian Union works to “help bring sweeping spiritual change to America” — and hopefully a “national revival.”
The ministry’s website is clear: With 68 percent of the most prominent American leaders in history produced by only 20 undergraduate institutions, ensuring Christian influence within these places is of paramount importance.
Here’s the kicker: Christian Union is the original parent organization of Harvard College Faith in Action.
***
HCFA is not the only parachurch on Harvard’s campus. Cru (known on campus as Harvard Christian Impact), Reformed University Fellowship (known here as Harvard Undergraduate Fellowship), and Asian American Christian Fellowship (stylized with the Harvard-Radcliffe name in front) are all also on campus.
Christian Union attributes Cru as one of its founding ministries: A Cru member founded Christian Union, which in turn is the original parent organization of HCFA. The historical lineage stretches from 1970s Southern California to us today.
This is not to say that all of the parachurches at Harvard go hand-in-hand with the Republican Party and Christian nationalist ideals. But we cannot be so quick to forget the history of how these organizations came to prominence.
On its website, HCFA states that they are “an independent student organization resourced by Christian Union Gloria.” However, in an interview, the current HCFA co-presidents Katherine Wang ’23 and Felix D. Perez Diener ’23 rejected the idea that Christian Union has any influence over the decisions made and values disseminated within the organization.
HCFA is “student-led and completely autonomous from Christian Union,” Perez Diener says.
“Christian Union resources and supports HCFA primarily through the staff by providing paid positions for those people to help us,” he continued. “But it doesn’t dictate decisions about events, retreats, speakers, or policy.”
***
HCFA seems to have disengaged from Christian Union in values, but it does not in funding.
I, for one, am encouraged by this. I applaud HCFA’s decision to prioritize the sentiments cultivated on campus by students, rather than adhere to some larger, bureaucratic structure disseminating values in a top-down manner.
Yet, HCFA does not appear to be wrestling with the history of how their own organization came to be. The case of parachurches brings us to a much larger question: How should Christian groups act within a pluralistic society?
I fear my answer will not make anyone happy.
Some will demand a complete condemnation of parachurches; others will argue that I do not understand the mission of Christianity. I hope to challenge each of these sides to recognize the truth in the narrative of the other.
Hold both at the same time: the mysticism of religion and the political consequences to those who do not believe the same.
For Christians, parachurches like Cru and Capitol Ministries are fantastic enactments of the Great Commission — the demand by Jesus to go out into the world and create disciples of Christ. They provide wonderful communities on college campuses and beyond for Christians to gather.
But for individuals who do not identify as Christian, parachurches — especially those that engage in the political sphere — feel incredibly dangerous. The existence of groups with fingers in the Capitol holding conservative, traditional, exclusionary-skewing values seems to directly attack the religious freedoms of others and the pluralistic society at large.
My intention is not to dismiss the evangelical, Biblical mission of Christian parachurches, nor the sense of belonging they provide; rather, I implore a recognition of their political consequences.
If you have an issue with my painting of religious groups in a political, sociological light, I ask you: What are you shying away from?
Recognition of political consequences does not mean that such groups are reduced to their sociological repercussions. You can hold historicization alongside a recognition of parachurches as extensions of deeply held, sincere beliefs.
I want to push back against the characterization that the sole motivation of parachurches is political. Religion is hard to study — although politics and sociology are facets of it worth considering, religion should not be reduced to them alone.
I challenge HCFA and other parachurches on Harvard’s campus and beyond, as well as individuals who do not identify as Christian, to hold these seemingly diametric narratives at the same time: Personal fulfillment and vital religious community can come from within parachurch organizations, and we can recognize and rectify the political and sociological consequences of their development.
Only with the whole truth of the matter on the table can we, together, hone the meaning and enact a functional pluralism democracy.

When footage of the murder of George Floyd began to circulate on social media in 2020, I remember feeling distraught. A part of me knew what I was going to witness by watching the video — the trauma of seeing someone that looked like my loved ones killed in broad daylight.
But what I didn’t realize was that I would be faced with rage not just against systemic racism, but also against a part of my own identity. As the left knee of Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, remained wedged against Floyd’s neck, Tou Thao, a Hmong officer, stood idle. According to footage of the incident, Thao motioned to bystanders to stay away from him and his colleagues while two other police officers restrained Floyd.
I am of both Black and Asian descent. At that moment, I felt betrayed by Thao. It felt confusing that someone of color could be blind to their standing in society — blind to the fact that they will never be proximate to whiteness. I felt uneasy in grappling with this tension not just within my own identity, but between two communities that I was a part of.
In the past few years, I have noticed a shift in the air regarding the standing of those of Asian descent in conversations of race. The murder of George Floyd, the growing number of violent crimes against Asian Americans in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Supreme Court hearing in October about the use of affirmative action by higher education institutions have all brought to the forefront the complicated nature of what it means to be Asian American.
Within this realization, the historical tension between Asian and Black communities in the United States has been revisited. But in moments of division, we must remind ourselves of our history of shared solidarity, because that solidarity is an essential foundation for recognizing our common enemy: white supremacy.
The tension between Black and Asian Americans did not start with George Floyd and Tou Thao. The murder of Floyd echoes a pivotal event in this history: the Los Angeles Riots of 1992.
On March 3, 1991, Rodney King, a Black man, was brutalized by a group of police officers in Los Angeles. Like Floyd’s, his interaction with police was documented on video, and similarly brought to the surface generations worth of frustration towards our nation’s law enforcement and justice system.
That same month, Latasha Harlins, a 15-year-old Black girl, was shot in a small corner store. The owner — a Korean woman — said Harlins was attempting to shoplift, and that she felt endangered enough to shoot her for self-defense.
Instantly, the streets of Los Angeles were flooded with protests for the deaths of both Harlins and King. In response, other Korean store owners armed themselves against Black rioters, initiating an unspoken racial standoff. As time went on, this animosity was passed on from generation to generation in both communities, and racist notions of the other began to solidify.
During the pandemic, this history has been leveraged against the Black and Asian communities. Because some of the recent crimes against Asian Americans were committed by Black people, some observers intentionally tried to reduce the situation to an exaggerated Black and Asian divide, intentionally ignoring the epidemics of xenophobia and white supremacy that had brought our nation to that point.
But the fragmented relationship between my two communities has seen occasional glimpses of healing. During the Black Power movement, Yuri Kochiyama and Malcolm X stood allied, supporting each other’s struggles for civil rights. Seconds after Malcolm X’s assassination, Kochiyama held his head in her lap.
And at a 2021 Black & Asian Solidarity rally in New York City, protesters called out acts of Asian hate in response to Covid-19 while holding up picket signs saying “Black Lives Matter.”
Together and unified, individuals chanted: “Show me what community looks like. This is what community looks like!”
At this rally, members of my two communities were able to acknowledge their differing experiences with race in America. This approach not only respects the privileges that one has over the other, but prevents us from equating the difficulties of the Asian American experience to the Black experience. From America’s sin of slavery to its xenophobic immigration policies, both the Asian and Black communities have faced and continue to face our nation’s white supremacist roots.
Instead of continuing a pattern of complacency, it is time that we acknowledge the true fight at hand — together. The struggles of Asian American and Black communities in America are certainly not interchangeable. But both struggles derive from the same system — a system that continues to thrive off our division.
In the words of activist Frannie Lou Hamer: “Nobody’s free until everybody’s free.”

Roughly 30 Harvard affiliates rallied on the steps of Memorial Church Wednesday afternoon to denounce the banning of books and the elimination of educational curricula on queer theory, gender theory, and critical race theory in parts of the United States.
The protest, held as part of a national day of action to support the “Freedom to Learn” campaign, was organized by Harvard Kennedy School professor Khalil G. Muhammad and Anoushka Chander ’25. Muhammad served as one of the national organizers for Freedom to Learn, which held at least 150 events in 30 states around the country on Wednesday.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, a speaker at the rally who organized against efforts to ban critical race theory in her home state of Virginia, said restricting discussions of race and gender in the classroom will impact more than just the quality of the education that students receive.
“The attacks that we’re seeing across the country, they’re not just attacks on our education, but they’re attacks on our stories, on our history, on our livelihoods, on our people,” she said.
“These are attacks that we cannot allow to keep happening,” Ahuja added.
Legislation or executive directives that limit the teaching of race and gender in schools exist in 18 states, including in Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. More could soon join that tally, as at least nine state legislatures around the country have introduced bills that, if passed, could limit the teaching of critical race theory.
“Legislatures have been seeking to censor our classrooms, ban books, and make sure that students of color do not feel safe in these classrooms,” Ahuja said. “But we, again, will not and cannot let them.”
Muhammad criticized Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ decision earlier this year to ban the College Board’s Advanced Placement African American Studies course in the state. He was one of 200 African American Studies faculty in higher education to sign an open letter criticizing the ban in February.
The rally also featured readings of passages from books banned in parts of the country. Mariah M. Norman ’25, a co-founder of the Black Arts Collective, read a passage from “The 1619 Project,” a book banned for centering the legacy of slavery in its account of U.S. history.
“I wanted to read a passage from this today because — with this specific project being as banned as it is — I feel like it’s very reflective of a hesitance from legislators to allow our children to know the truth and to defend our history in a way that is reflective of how we, as a country, were born,” said Norman, a Crimson Magazine editor.
Muhammad, who teaches a mandatory course on race and racism for master’s of public policy students at HKS, said in his speech that historically, Harvard has taught propaganda and misinformation in response to societal pressures.
“We know that the oldest, most prestigious university in this country has also told its fair share of lies,” he said. “It has told the stories of the inferiority of people of Indigenous ancestry, of African ancestry, of women, and countless others who have come to these shores in search of opportunity and yet have been the subjects of analysis about who they are and who they aren’t, and whether they belong or don’t.”
“So this problem is an old problem,” Muhammad added. “And this problem isn’t just in the backwaters of rural counties.”
Last year, Harvard released a report detailing its extensive ties to the history of slavery, including the ways in which Harvard scholars and leaders in the 19th and 20th century “promoted ‘race science’ and eugenics and conducted abusive ‘research,’" the report said.
Muhammad told the crowd that to combat bans on critical race and gender studies, they will need to inspire others to join them in defending the truth.
“The problem of misinformation, the problem of anti-truth — or what I call organized and legislated lies — is a problem fundamentally of power, the power to control the lives of others,” he said.
“At the end of the day, truth has always been the antidote to oppression. Literacy has always been the most powerful weapon to define your own reality and to take back your own agency,” Muhammad added.

Harvard Affiliates Protest Book Bans, Laws Against Critical Race Theory
Former Harvard president Lawrence H. Summers met repeatedly with and solicited donations from sex trafficker and financier Jeffrey E. Epstein, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
Epstein also donated millions of dollars to Harvard during Summers’ tenure as University president from 2001 to 2006 — an extension of Epstein’s close ties to the University and several of its affiliates. Even after Harvard stopped accepting donations from Epstein following his guilty plea in 2008, he and Summers continued to meet.
The Journal’s article came days after it reported on meetings between Epstein, Harvard professor Martin A. Nowak, and linguist Noam Chomsky.
According to documents reviewed by the Journal, Summers wrote an email to Epstein in April 2014 asking for “small scale philanthropy advice” for his wife, Harvard professor Elisa New, who was in the process of establishing Verse Video Education, an online poetry project.
“My life will be better if i raise $1m for Lisa,” wrote Summers, who is currently a professor at Harvard. “Mostly it will go to make it a pbs series and for teacher training. Ideas?”
Epstein replied confirming a meeting in Cambridge, and the pair met two days later at The Fireplace, a restaurant in Brookline, for dinner, the Journal reported. The meeting was one of several the pair scheduled that year.
In the years between 2013 and 2016, Summers scheduled more than a dozen meetings with Epstein, several of which were dinners.
In a statement to the Journal, a spokesperson for Summers said he “deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction.”
The spokesperson said Summers did not solicit donations for the University from Epstein following his conviction and also did not personally receive money from him.
“Their interactions primarily focused on global economic issues,” she said.
The spokesperson also said New’s nonprofit “regrets accepting funding from Epstein” and later made a contribution “exceeding the amount received, to a group working against sex trafficking.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the relationship between Epstein and Summers, referring instead to a report released in May 2020 following Harvard’s investigation of Epstein’s ties to the University.
The report found that Epstein donated $9.1 million to Harvard from 1997 to 2007 — until the University halted donations from Epstein following his 2008 conviction — and visited campus several times even after his conviction.
But the report makes minimal mentions of Summers’ relationship with Epstein. In fact, Summers only appears in the report one time in a description of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, which was “established in 2003 by Harvard University President Lawrence H. Summers following an imaginative proposal by Jeffrey Epstein and Benedict Gross.”
The report likewise only mentions New once, in a footnote acknowledging that one of Epstein’s foundations, Gratitude America, donated $110,000 to New’s nonprofit, Verse Video Education.
“Neither of these gifts was a gift to Harvard,” the report reads. “For that reason, our review did not examine the circumstances surrounding these gifts.”

Woman Injured by Falling Equipment at Harvard Square T Station
Amid ongoing renovations, Adam House’s Randolph Hall, one of Harvard’s undergraduate residences, saw an unexpected addition last Friday morning when a construction lift tipped over and collided with its wall.
At around 11:30 a.m., Cambridge Fire and Inspectional Services, the Harvard University Police Department, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration responded to the incident, stabilizing the machine and safely removing the operator who was inside the lift when it tipped.
Workers were installing a street pole on the site of the ongoing Adams House Renewal Project when the lift, a construction Lull machine, tipped onto its left side and collided with the third story of the building.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick described the step-by-step process of safely removing the operator and securing the lift in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
First, “step chocks were used to stabilize the machine,” Warnick wrote, after which “a windshield was removed to allow the operator to exit.”
After the operator was removed, “another crane was utilized to rig the street pole to the ground safely and bring the Lull machine to a complete upright position,” he added.
To secure the area while the operator was rescued and the lift was righted, the main entrance to Russell Hall was temporarily closed and Plympton Street was blocked off. Pedestrian and vehicle traffic were rerouted for a short period.
The accident took place during the final weeks of construction at Randolph Hall, the second of three phases of the Adams House renovations. The incident will not delay the project, nor was damage significant to the newly renovated building.
A visual assessment of Randolph Hall following the collision indicated only minimal damage to a windowsill and cracking of a single brick.
The collision and response lasted three hours, with HUPD leaving the scene after Cambridge Fire at 2:50 p.m.
Though no one was harmed, the lift accident drew attention to occupational safety on construction sites at Harvard. According to OSHA, falls are the most common cause of death on construction sites, and construction work is among the most dangerous professions.
In 2018, for example, two construction workers sustained injuries when they fell from a structure being built for Harvard in Allston. Ten years earlier, a worker was rushed to the hospital after falling nearly 30 feet from a Harvard construction site in Cambridge.
In the recent incident, Harvard communicated with OSHA and Cambridge Fire as required by safety regulations throughout the incident.
“We are thankful that no one was injured and that there was only minimal disruption to the area,” wrote College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo.

Harvard Postdocs Call for Increased Pay in Open Letter to University
News
After Criticism Over Roth Veto, HKS Dean Elmendorf Stresses Importance of Discussing Difficult Issues
Harvard postdoctoral researchers published an open letter April 27 calling on the University to improve and standardize compensation across departments.
The letter, published in the Chronicle of Higher Education, asked Harvard to raise the postdoc pay scale, guarantee employer-sponsored health insurance, increase childcare benefits, and provide employer-matched retirement contributions.
More than 30 representatives of Harvard’s postdoctoral associations signed the letter, including those from Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
While Harvard has not publicly responded to the letter, Harvard FAS Postdoctoral Association Advocacy Committee Chair and Treasurer Rachel L. Harris said postdocs are “in communication” and intend to meet with both divisional deans and Harvard President-elect Claudine Gay in the coming weeks.
“We want to work together on this. We’re not wanting to be antagonizing because that’s not productive,” Harris said.
“But the data don’t lie, and they haven’t lied for years, and we want to make it known that it’s not just the time for listening,” she added. “It’s time for action.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that Harvard had received the letter but declined to comment on its contents.
There are more than 7,000 postdocs at Harvard and its affiliated institutions who typically perform research either funded through specific departments or with grants, scholarships, or fellowships they apply for independently.
“We’re generally hired by faculty to work on research projects as the first step of the academic career path — so many postdocs aim to apply to tenure-track faculty jobs, though others also go into industry or government jobs,” Kelsey M. Tyssowski, former president of the Harvard FAS Postdoctoral Association and current board member, wrote in an email.
The letter acknowledged many postdocs are paid directly by faculty members and asked Harvard to allocate “central funds” or use some of the University’s endowment or budget surplus — which was $406 million in 2022 — to support salary increases.
“Inadequate compensation provided to postdocs has made pursuing a postdoc position at Harvard and its affiliates a privilege not everyone can afford,” the letter reads.
Current postdoc salaries are set using the National Institutes of Health National Research Service Award salary scale, which is not adjusted for cost of living. The cost of living in Boston is 30 percent higher than the national average, according to a recent Purdue study cited in the letter.
The letter endorsed a starting salary of $77,738, which is the minimum salary in the Federal Government General Schedule pay scale level 11, and is $21,254 more than the current minimum starting salary for all postdoc positions according to the NIH-NRSA scale.
“If you think about the sense of the work that everybody’s doing under the same affiliations of a postdoc, it’s unequally compensated,” said Mayank Chugh, Harvard Medical Postdoctoral Association president.
In the letter, the postdocs alleged that Harvard pays less than half of what peer institutions pay when adjusted for cost of living.
“In order for a postdoc in Boston to be compensated competitively with a peer institution such as St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. (where the minimum salary policy is $70,013/year), the minimum salary at Harvard would need to be $124,531, more than twice the NIH-NRSA postdoc starting salary minimum,” the letter added.
“It’s hard for a lot of people who have any sort of financial stress, any sort of care responsibilities, to choose to make half as much money,” Tyssowski said. “For some people, that’s not a choice they can afford to make.”
The signatories also argued comparatively low compensation has contributed to a postdoc population that is “particularly lacking in diversity compared to peer institutions,” citing internal Postdoc Association surveys from 2021 and 2022.
The same surveys found that postdocs of color were paid less than white postdocs across departments surveyed — “a result mainly driven by low salaries of international scholars of color,” the 2022 report added.
The letter comes three months after Harvard’s non-tenure-track faculty — including postdocs — began collecting union cards for official recognition, which they are continuing to do, according to Harvard Academic Workers organizer and postdoc Morgan S.A. Gilman.
“The goals of the PDA and HAW overlap but a union seeks to bargain with the administration and is separate from Harvard in a way that the postdoc association doesn’t need to be. But individuals can certainly be a part of both organizations,” Gilman wrote.
Harris said while the letter is “meant to be considered separately from the ongoing union campaign,” it is “part of the same conversation” around compensation at Harvard.

Former Harvard President Lawrence Summers Met Repeatedly with Jeffrey Epstein
Washing away their finals-induced stress, Harvard undergraduates stripped, screamed, and sprinted through a rainy Harvard Yard for this semester’s installment of Primal Scream.
Known as Primal Scream, the biannual tradition of running a naked lap around the Yard on the eve of final exam period continued in this week’s chilling rain. At midnight on Wednesday, students gathered in front of Hollis Hall, removed any remaining garments, and bared it all as they ran a tour of the Yard.
Primal Scream, a rite that dates back to at least 1995, is a chance for students to release any stress from the semester and decompress before their looming final exams. Typically, a few participants remain in their undergarments, while many wear nothing but shoes.
The semi-clothed Harvard University Band assembled in front of the John Harvard statue to play music for the streakers, accompanying runners’ screams with lively tunes.
Kasia A. Zarzycka ’23 first participated in the tradition in the fall of her freshman year, an experience that she described as “so much fun.” She returned to the tradition for the spring of her senior year.
“This is my last time, so I gotta do it,” she said. “I’m actually so excited.”
After completing the naked lap, Zarzycka said she felt “so much more energized.”
“I think it’s great to be able to release these emotions, and I think it’s really bonding,” she said. “People are actually, you know, letting their true selves out. I think this is fantastic. I absolutely love it.”
Jorden S. Wallican-Okyere ’26, who did not participate in the streaking but attended to support her friend, said the tradition was a “cathartic experience” and “a good way to bond with your other classmates.”
“You know, the adrenaline. You’re excited for finals,” she said.
Other students cared more about the excitement of the streaking itself than stress relief.
“I just like screaming and running,” said Meredith E. Blanchard ’26, who participated in Primal Scream with her suitemates.
Justin Ji ’26, who ran his first Primal Scream last semester, said the main appeal was “trying something new” and going out of his “comfort zone.”
“I’d never done something like this in high school,” he said.
Ji described his “first time going naked in front of the public” as “very freeing.”
Accompanying this semester’s scream was the typical crowd of tourists around the John Harvard statue, including some who observed from folding chairs. Some of the onlookers recorded Primal Scream with videos and flash photography.
But Ryan P. Adams ’26 said neither the poor weather nor the sightseers bothered him.
“When you’re in the moment, you’re not thinking about all that. Some people do it just to do it, but I do it to run — run and win,” Adams said.
“I love being athletic, and flexing on all these people with my athleticism was pretty cool,” he added.
Despite the cold and rainy weather, which may have interfered with some screamers’ experiences, Warren Zhu ’26 said he had no reservations toward the tradition.
“It was easy. I love being naked,” he said. “I think it should be a daily tradition. Every day, 10 o’clock, every single day.”
“I love the weather. The colder it is, the better it is,” he added. “This kind of tradition, you need a fucking challenge.”

Harvard is considering moving its Fine Arts Library into Lamont Library from Littauer Center, a change that would dedicate significant space in the historically undergraduate library to materials on arts and architecture.
The potential changes to Lamont were raised during a Harvard Library Spaces Community Update last month, discussing possible transformations of public access, usage, and design of Harvard Yard’s four libraries in the coming years.
Harvard is working to “develop a new vision for Harvard Yard’s iconic physical libraries” through its Yard Libraries Feasibility Study — a project launched this fall in collaboration with Ennead Architects and their research partner brightspot — according to the Harvard Library reference wiki.
“We heard from students that Lamont has a ‘homey’ feeling, and its own sort of charm, but it also feels a bit rundown,” Martha Whitehead, vice president for the Harvard Library, wrote in an emailed statement.
“As part of the Feasibility Study, we are exploring a variety of ways to relocate the Fine Arts Library to the Yard so its collections are closer for students to access,” Whitehead wrote. “And we certainly plan to maintain Lamont as a student study space, but those two ideas are not mutually exclusive.”
Beyond Lamont, specific aspects of the new vision may include significant changes to the Yard’s three other library spaces for students — Houghton, Pusey, and Widener.
“We’ve heard ideas for ‘touch-down’ space, more open space, and more tech-enabled space,” Whitehead wrote.
The study is also considering expanding public access to the Yard libraries.
“There are limited opportunities for the non-Harvard community to engage with our physical collections and spaces,” Whitehead wrote. “We’re looking at ways to engage the broader community, say creating an exhibition space that highlights what everyone can get from our digital collections online.”
The Feasibility Study sought student input from August 2022 through January 2023, surveying around 150 affiliates on their views on the libraries through focus groups, tours, and other outreach initiatives.
“We ensured a representative group of students were taking part, including holding sessions to learn from students with disabilities and those from historically marginalized groups,” Whitehead wrote.
This plan is part of a series of changes to the Yard’s libraries in past years. Houghton Library’s renovation focused on improving accessibility and making the space more welcoming. Countway Library, the Harvard Divinity School Library, and the Harvard Radcliffe Institute Schlesinger Library were also renovated recently.
“Widener, meanwhile, was last updated nearly 20 years ago,” Whitehead wrote.
Whitehead stressed, however, that no action has been solidified or even planned yet, explaining that the project is currently in its information-gathering phase, which will likely be followed by a planning phase next year.
“This is not yet a plan,” she wrote. “We are still in an exploratory phase. We’re still looking at all the options, surfacing all the ideas, and examining all the possibilities.”
“It will be a few years before we’re seeing any of these changes,” she added.

Jeffrey Epstein Met With Harvard Professor Martin Nowak and Noam Chomsky in 2015 in Harvard Office
The Harvard Alumni Association announced Monday that it will continue to offer email forwarding services for alumni in partnership with an external company, reversing course following alumni outcry.
The HAA wrote in an emailed announcement that it would partner with an external email forwarding service to “effectively manage privacy regulations and compliance requirements” to address problems including frequently bounced emails, spam, and phishing emails that affect the current service.
Email forwarding addresses provide an alias where emails can be received, but they do not function as a full inbox. Alumni who support retaining the accounts have pointed to their use for networking and job searches.
Graduates prior to the Class of 2021 had the ability to create an @post.harvard.edu or @alumni.harvard.edu email forwarding address, but the HAA announced in 2021 that it would discontinue the ability to create new addresses.
Last September, the HAA announced that it would deactivate all existing alumni email forwarding addresses, prompting thousands of Harvard alumni to sign Change.org petitions to criticize the decision. Following the outcry, the HAA announced in October that it would not continue with the deactivations.
According to the email, graduates in the classes of 2021 and 2022 will be the first to receive the new service, followed by the graduating Class of 2023. This fall, existing accounts will be migrated to the new service. In 2024, the service will be opened up to alumni who have not yet activated forwarding accounts and future graduating classes.
“Our primary goal throughout this process is to minimize the impact on current users and provide an easy setup of email forwarding for new users,” the HAA wrote in the email.
Victoria W. K. “Vicky” Leung ’91, president of the Harvard Club of the United Kingdom, said she uses her Harvard alumni email address frequently, including for registering for websites and accessing tax returns and official documents.
“When I heard about the discontinuation in September, I was very dismayed because people like me adopt it on the promise that it’s going to be permanent,” Leung said. “And it’s going to be the one email you need all your life.”
From Leung’s conversation with other alumni, however, she has gotten “polarized” reactions regarding the email forwarding service.
“If you have the @post.harvard.edu email address, it is a matter of great concern,” she said. “But if you don’t have it, you can’t care less.”
Rodney S. Lafuente Mercado ’22, who graduated last December, said he foresees himself using the alumni email address frequently. During his job search, he said he saw a “huge” increase in replies when he emailed using his @college.harvard.edu address compared to emails sent from his personal address.
Unlike Harvard, many of Harvard’s peer universities opt to provide their alumni with full-service inboxes.
“Twenty-plus out of 25 offer actual inboxes to their alumni. Harvard has always only had the forwarding address,” said David L. Huang ’97, the lead organizer of a petition against the deactivations that received more than 3,000 signatures.
Despite efforts to create full-functionality email inboxes, the idea was ruled out early, according to Huang and Helen A. Fairman ’91, a co-organizer of the petition.
Fairman said the HAA is concerned with the potential liability of having to hand over the content of emails during legal proceedings.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on requests for a full inbox and referred reporters to an updated email forwarding page on the HAA’s website.
Still, Leung said Harvard is “definitely moving in the right direction.”
“I am very happy that they listened to us because their alumni body is probably the single biggest resource,” Leung said. “And it’s so reassuring that they see that we’re important.”

Outgoing Harvard Divinity School Dean Hempton to Remain Until August as Search for Successor Continues
James C. Kitch ’22-’23 wasn’t expecting a birthday gift from the Harvard Prize Office. But on Thursday, he received a call from a friend who told him that she had a surprise.
The friend sent him the list of the 2022-23 Hoopes Prize recipients. Both their names were on it.
“It was a nice birthday present,” he said.
The prize, awarded to 74 Harvard seniors this year, is funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes, Class of 1919, and aims to recognize “excellent undergraduate work,” usually in the form of a senior thesis. Each student winner receives a $5,000 award. Faculty nominators of winning projects are awarded $2,000 for “excellence in the art of teaching.”
Susan L. Lively, secretary of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote on behalf of the Prize Office that “these students should be proud of this accomplishment.”
“The work of these undergraduates represents academic excellence across a broad range of topics and fields,” she wrote.
This year’s Hoopes Prize-winning topics include a classicist’s examination of transgender lives in ancient Rome, an astrophysicist’s research on superluminous supernovae, and a mechanical engineer’s creation of a compressed air assisted bicycle.
Some of the awardees said they were shocked by the news.
“I was in Quincy dining hall and one of my best friends Juliet also found out, and we kind of just looked at each other, hugged, and then screamed together in the middle of Quincy dining hall,” Annie Miall ’22-’23 said.
Reese M. Caldwell ’22-’23 said he received a congratulatory text from a friend before he even found out he had received the award.
“He said, ‘Oh, you haven’t heard. You won the Hoopes,’” he said. “So that was a nice little celebration moment I got to have.”
The Harvard Prize Office emailed him a couple of hours later, he added.
The projects recognized by the prize represent a wide range of research and writing processes.
Elizabeth S. Propst ’22-’23, who wrote her thesis on the Cormac McCarthy novel “Blood Meridian,” took a road trip from her home in North Carolina to Texas to do research for her thesis.
“I lived in a cabin kind of in the middle of nowhere in the desert for about a week and then just spent all day, nine to five, at these archives going through the office papers,” she said. “So it was a real sort of hermit moment, but was just really grateful to be able to spend some time just with the project and just with myself.”
English concentrator Darius Atefat-Peckham ’23 wrote a thesis that wasn’t a traditional academic paper, but a poetry collection about “ancestral memory and intergenerational trauma” with a focus on the Iranian Diaspora. Throughout his life, he has used poetry as a method of connection to his mother, also a poet, who died when Atefat-Peckham was three years old.
“I found throughout that the process of working with teachers, like Jorie Graham and Tracy K. Smith, who’s my adviser, was a way of revealing more about myself, as well as my relationship to my mother,” Atefat-Peckham said.
Miall changed her thesis project in mid-December despite having written a chapter for her original topic. She switched late in the process because she decided she “couldn’t give up this newfound curiosity of mine” and ultimately wrote about the history of prisoners with HIV/AIDS.
She said that she hopes more people will read her thesis as a result of receiving the prize and “understand a very dark part of history that’s so often hidden away and not talked about.”
Some of the recipients will be pursuing opportunities after graduation that tie to their thesis research.
Caldwell, who will be starting a Ph.D. in Biological and Biomedical Sciences at Harvard this fall, said that pursuing a Ph.D. would be a “continuation of this trajectory” of research.
Cade M. Williams ’23, a joint concentrator in Anthropology and Folklore and Mythology who wrote his thesis on confederate monument removal in New Orleans, doesn’t have post-graduate plans that tie directly to his thesis. But he said he still hopes to participate in furthering ideas of social justice through a career in publishing.
“I really have a passion for knowledge and sharing ideas that I think can make positive change in the world,” Williams said. “I think that publishing is a great way to get into that and really try to share novel concepts, but also rethink old ideas that people might have.”
Kitch, who conducted biostatistical research for his thesis, said he plans to continue pursuing this field of research after college.
“It’s definitely the most fulfilling, the most interesting piece of research that I’ve ever done,” he said. “But I also hope that it’s not the best piece of research that I ever do.”

Harvard Postdocs Call for Increased Pay in Open Letter to University
The Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to approve an amended Harvard College Student Handbook with an updated leave of absence policy at a Tuesday afternoon meeting in Sanders Theatre — the final meeting of the semester.
By a unanimous voice vote, faculty approved an amended handbook which included expanded criteria for requiring students to take involuntary leaves of absence from the College. The new policy says leaves may be required following a hospitalization or other situations that pose “serious concerns about the student’s health or well-being and reasonably call into question their ability to function as a student in the Harvard College environment.”
A new clause in the handbook allows students to opt to take a voluntary leave of absence for medical reasons rather than be placed on involuntary leave.
The new policy also allows the College to make a student’s enrollment or return to campus conditional on a written agreement, which can include stipulations such as compliance with a treatment plan from a health care professional. It says that failure to comply with the terms of a written agreement is grounds for an involuntary leave of absence.
The new handbook language also amends and clarifies the process for students seeking to appeal an involuntary leave of absence or a denied petition to return to campus after a medical leave of absence.
Students in either position can appeal the decision to a committee chaired by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and “composed of representatives from College and University offices” within five days.
Previously, students could appeal an involuntary leave decision first to the dean or the “Dean’s delegate” directly and then to the Administrative Board, but there was no clear route to appeal denied petitions to return to campus after a medical leave.
Other amendments to the handbook included the reiteration of Harvard’s inaugural University-wide anti-bullying policies announced in March, as well as changes to the undergraduate language requirement and simultaneous enrollment policy approved by faculty at the March FAS meeting.
Faculty also voted unanimously to approve initial course catalogs for the College, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and Harvard Extension School.
During the meeting, both outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow and FAS Dean Claudine Gay, who will take over as president in July, spoke warmly about working with Harvard faculty.
“We are not a community of half-measures, and I’m inspired every day by your willingness to hold ourselves to the highest possible standards,” Gay said in remarks to faculty.
She issued a “challenge” for the faculty to critically evaluate long-standing traditions of faculty governance, including assessing if “practices that made sense a generation ago meet our needs today.”
Referencing her March decision to break tradition as University president by not chairing future FAS meetings, Gay said she hoped to see “the faculty in its full breadth and diversity” coming “together to make decisions about its future,” eliciting a “hear, hear” from a member of the audience.
In remarks concluding the meeting, Bacow thanked the faculty for lively and vigorous discussions, even in times of disagreement.
“As we have argued before the Supreme Court, we embrace diversity, because we learn from our differences,” Bacow said, referring to the Students For Fair Admissions lawsuit against Harvard in which the court is widely expected to rule against race-based admissions practices. “These differences must always include diversity of viewpoint.”
The meeting was followed by a reception in the transept of Memorial Hall celebrating the tenures of Gay and Bacow.
During the meeting, Gay also announced that five faculty were named Harvard College Professors — a five-year appointment recognizing excellence in undergraduate teaching with an increase in funding — and that six were elected to the Faculty Council, a steering committee for faculty governance.
The new Harvard College Professors are Psychology professor Fiery A. Cushman ’03, History professor Philip J. Deloria, Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Sean R. Eddy, Earth and Planetary Sciences professor Zhiming Kuang, and Physics professor Mara Prentiss.
The six newly elected Faculty Council members are Statistics professor Joseph K. Blitzstein, East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor Shigehisa Kuriyama ’77, History professor Erez Manela, History of Science professor Hannah Marcus, Romance Languages and Literatures professor Usha Reena Rungoo, and Chemistry and Chemical Biology lecturer Gregory C. “Gregg” Tucci.

Leaders of the Harvard Kennedy School told students they plan to implement emotional well-being training for teaching fellows and course assistants in the next academic year.
HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, Dean of Academic Affairs Debra E. Isaacson, and Academic Dean for Teaching and Curriculum Suzanne J. Cooper addressed these changes during a meeting Thursday morning with the Soul Keepers, a student mental health advocacy group.
The group wrote an open letter in late April calling on HKS to publicly commit to increased support for student and faculty emotional well-being. The letter was written amid heightened student focus on mental health issues at the school following the suicide of HKS student Mateo Gomez in December.
The changes also include providing orientations on mental health over the summer for students, as well as providing mental health resources on all syllabi and course pages. These changes would follow the January hiring of Jimmy Kane as senior associate director of student support services at the Kennedy School as part of a series of reforms aimed at mental and emotional health and well-being among the school’s students.
“I think it’s safe to say that all three will happen in the next school cycle,” Isaacson said of the changes.
Isaacson told the students that she is working with Canvas experts and Harvard’s Graduate School of Education to make important mental health information easily accessible to students. Kane is looking at ways that those materials can be tweaked to be most effective for Kennedy School students.
Isaacson also said she has a meeting in place with leaders of student orientations in HKS’ two-year programs “to think about the coverage of students’ mental health and well-being in orientation, both in the materials that we share, before, during and after, and also in terms of a session that we could run.”
To address the third point on the list, Isaacson said Cooper is working with her team to think about how to incorporate training about how to identify struggling students and refer them to appropriate resources.
“We want to make sure that students we’ve hired to be course assistants and teaching fellows aren’t taking on the responsibility of serving in a clinical capacity for our students around their mental health,” Isaacson said. “So instead, we want to make sure that they’re trained to understand how to watch for changes in behavior or other indicators that someone might be struggling, and then how to get the students to the right resources.”
In an interview prior to the meeting, Elmendorf told The Crimson that emotional well-being is not a new priority for the Kennedy School.
“I’ve been concerned about student well-being from the day I became dean,” Elmendorf said. “My responsibility is to help our students learn and grow and thrive at the school. A lot of aspects of that, part of that is their personal well-being.”
In the fall, the school launched a search for a senior associate director of student support services after noticing a deficit in administrative mental health support.
“There were lots of people in our Student Affairs Office in particular who are spending time with students who are facing challenges to their well-being, and we didn’t have enough capacity to meet all of the questions and concerns that we wanted to be able to address,” Elmendorf said. “Spreading this just across everybody has its virtue, but then we also would benefit from having somebody who was just single-mindedly devoted to this topic.”
Nonetheless, Elmendorf said he does not see this as the only solution.
“The challenges to mental health, particularly young people, but others also in our society, have increased over time, and I think for students at the Kennedy School who are so deeply committed to making a better world, a lot of things that happen in the world that hit people here particularly hard,” Elmendorf said. “So this is an important ongoing challenge for us.”
Following the meeting, the next goal of the Soul Keepers is to keep the momentum going after many members of the group graduate from HKS this year.
“We’re really happy to know that this is something that you will be able to demand for the next school cycle,” HKS student and member of the Soul Keepers Sebastian B. Fernandez said during the meeting. “We are all gearing into graduating in the next few days and so now we’re working on how to keep the work going.”

After Criticism Over Roth Veto, HKS Dean Elmendorf Stresses Importance of Discussing Difficult Issues

Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, who earlier this year faced scrutiny for allegedly vetoing a fellow who was critical of Israel, stressed the importance of discussing difficult issues at Harvard and around the country in a Tuesday interview.
In January, Elmendorf faced widespread backlash from faculty and students following reporting by the Nation that he vetoed the fellowship of Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth at the Carr Center for Human Rights, allegedly over Roth’s criticism of Israel. Elmendorf later reversed his decision, following petitions calling for his resignation and nationwide scrutiny.
“I think there is a broad concern in higher education in this country about whether students feel they can engage in candid conversations about difficult issues,” Elmendorf said in an interview with The Crimson.
“Empowering candid conversations is not something that deans can wave a magic wand to accomplish,” he added.
During a February Institute of Politics forum, Roth accused Harvard of demonstrating “plenty of pro-Israel tilting” and called for change to the balance of pro-Palestinine and pro-Israel perspectives among speakers and faculty.
But on Tuesday, Elmendorf said affiliates offer a “range of views about Israel and the Palestinians” and denied that the Kennedy School is biased on any political issues.
“The school is not pro or anti any particular position on public policy issues,” he said. “The school is a place for people to learn and form their own views about public policy issues.”
Elmendorf said HKS has a committee that aims to foster constructive dialogue among affiliates on different issues.
“I think we have more work to do on candid conversations generally, and I think that work can and will apply across a whole range of different difficult issues,” he said.
Elmendorf said he believes constructive conversations on divisive topics can benefit both the education and the future professional success of HKS students.
“Being able to disagree with somebody in a way that is hard on the topic, but not personally offensive, can take some practice. It’s something people need to learn how to do,” Elmendorf said.
“Not all of our current public leaders model that very well, but it’s crucial for effective public leadership,” he added.
During the interview, Elmendorf also discussed the potential merger of HKS’ Master of Public Policy and Master of Public Administration programs into one expanded degree. Elmendorf wrote in a March email that the school was in “early stages of exploring” a plan to combine the two programs.
Elmendorf said there are three primary considerations in potentially combining the programs, pointing to an imbalance between the number of applicants to the MPP versus the MPA program, calls to increase flexibility, and the need to accommodate joint degree programs.
“The idea that these programs might come together is an old idea predating my time in school,” he said. “It was considered before, recommended by some people before, not quite pursued.”
In January, the Kennedy School Student Government sent an email to MPA students, writing that Elmendorf made the “broad decision” to merge the programs. According to the email, Elmendorf told representatives in the meeting that “high level decisions concerning program changes do not require student input.”
On Tuesday, Elmendorf said administrators are speaking with alumni of the program, current students, faculty, and staff to make an informed decision on the merger.
​​”It’s important in making big changes to hear a lot of different voices,” Elmendorf said. “I decided it was worth doing a deep dive. Nobody has decided what we will ultimately do because that depends on the consultations we’re having.”

The year is finally coming to an end, which means it’s time to get rid of all your BoardPlus as quickly as possible! It unfortunately does not roll over onto next semester’s, so this is URGENT. But don’t go around throwing your money at *any* place. Take a look at our top five places to give away your BoardPlus so that you not only spend Harvard’s money swiftly … but also smartly.
Lehman Hall 
Are you interested in a good lunch and a variety of delicious options? Well, make your way to Lehman Hall (the gorgeous gray building beside Straus and Matthews), where Santos (the guy behind the food bar) uses his culinary magic to create some of the most delicious bowls and burritos. There’s also ramen, rice bowls, and cake that will keep you full for hours. Lehman Hall turns you into the academic weapon that you were always meant to be!
Caspersen Center (The Law School)
Are you interested in law? Are you interested in anything other than law? Look no further than the Caspersen Center at HLS! Practically one of the best choices, this center has not only two options for food: A coffee shop and a full cafeteria. They also have beautiful study spaces! And they’re open after 2 p.m.!! Caspersen will make you forget you ever knew HUDS — the flavors? They are more than immaculate.
Quincy Grill/Cabot Cafe
Undergrads can do it too. Do you need a late night snack? Are you out partying and the dhall isn’t open late enough? Well make your way to Quincy Grill or Cabot Cafe and throw all of your boardplus at them. Managed by students, these quaint places feel like a homely diner from a movie. The vibes are 10/10: the prices are low, you can get some delicious late night food (at Quincy) and the best coffee around (at Cabot).
Buckminster’s
Are you a fan of coffee? We know you are. Head straight to Buckminster’s (watch out though! it’s in a niche location — in the weird extension of the Science Center). This cafe does not have a massive variety of food but has you covered in the pastry and wonderful drinks category. Make sure to stay caffeinated during finals season.
Science Engineering Cafe
Do you want to sit in a beautiful building and imagine that you are the main character in a young adult dystopian movie? Well, walk down to the SEC across the river near Trader Joe’s (aka the best place EVER). A beautiful building (on the outside), this is the perfect place to go when you need to get away from Harvard’s humanities girlies. The cafe is huge — like a miniature grocery store drenched in yellow. There’s hot chocolate, breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and so much more. If you like flyby (which we all know you do *wink*), then this is the place for you! Run (or shuttle) over there NOW!!
We hope this list was wonderful, beautiful, and everything you could have ever asked for. BoardPlus can be scary. But don’t stress, the top five places will make sure all your worries go away. Now go! Spend that BoardPlus! Make haste!
