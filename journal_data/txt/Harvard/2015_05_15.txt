After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of a Crimson news story, controversy has surfaced regarding the environment in Dunster House for students who identify as BGLTQ. At a late January meeting with college administrators, one resident tutor raised concerns about this issue, and students, faculty members, and others have since confirmed the widespread perception that the House is less welcoming to BGLTQ students than it is to others. The reasons for this perception are still largely unclear and will likely prove difficult to define; the suggestion of a hostile environment, however, is cause for further investigation on the part of the College.
As the College considers its response to the issues in Dunster, members of the community must be careful not to make unfounded accusations about the root causes of the House’s problems. The main points of contention have been over Dunster’s lack of resident tutors who identify as BGLTQ for the past two years and the House Masters’ contested decision not to renew the contract of one tutor who often handled BGLTQ issues.
Both are serious issues. Either the House or the College should have addressed the first much sooner, and the second deserves a fuller explanation. But the idea of “a hostile environment” is hard to pin down, appears to extend beyond these specific concerns, and may have less obvious causes. Until we know more, speculation about those causes is unhelpful.
Furthermore, recently announced efforts in Dunster appear promising. Next year, the House will receive two resident tutors who identify as BGLTQ. Also, House Master Roger Porter said that Dunster will give a “generous budget” to its “specialty tutor activities” next year. (In previous years, the House’s BGLTQ programming has lacked its own budget.) These steps, though overdue, are an indication that the House has realized that it must address its reputation.
That being said, the College should continue to look into the exact causes of Dunster’s perceived unfriendliness to BGLTQ students. After one prominent event in 2004, emails over Dunster’s open list alleged that the House was “exceptionally homophobic.” One student recounted, “There was a sense that you were closeted, but only in the House.” If students feel that way in what is supposed to be their home away from home at Harvard, then both the House and the College must take action. Environments that foster negative feelings are destructive of the openness and inclusivity essential to Harvard’s mission.
The College should continue to probe the matter and address what factors might be causing this problem. A 2011 report on Harvard BGLTQ student life noted students’ suggestions “that there be at least one BGLTQ person on staff in each house.” With that in mind, College administrators should ensure that no house goes without a resident tutor who identifies as BGLTQ for as long as Dunster has. More broadly, the College should take a greater interest when less tangible but still serious problems like the environment for BGLTQ students in Dunster continue for a significant stretch of time.
Each House should be a community whose members feel comfortable being who they are. When even one member is not, that is a problem the College and the wider community need to address.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a feeling that used to surge through my body each time I entered Harvard Yard. I felt it when I left Weld. I felt it when I saw the Memorial Church spire. It was the swooping feeling of cresting high altitudes.
It was a feeling of gratitude. How grateful I was to find my nerdy self in a community of thinkers, each person I met—each student and each dining hall worker, each librarian and each professor—a new, miraculous world.
And it was a feeling of possibility. A feeling that here, at this place, with these people, we could create things we had never even dreamed: new technologies, new songs, new ways to live.
I grew up in a nice place full of nice people. But it was a small town, and often, people’s minds were small, too. I was too smart, too loud, too queer. My hips were too wide; I had too many questions. I did not agree that I was lesser because I liked girls, or was one. I did not laugh at the jokes my teachers made in class.
There was an invisible band tight around my ribs: my entire self bursting at the seams.
At Harvard, I burst out.
The sense of freedom, those first few weeks, was incredible. I met people who understood my literary references, who wanted to talk for hours about politics and poems. I met feminists, I met people who wanted to kiss me, I met people from all over the world, I wore heels, I read "Ulysses," I danced and danced.
For the first time in my life, I could be as big as myself.
I wanted to eat everything, say yes to everything, know everyone, fuck everyone, take it all in.
I sucked the air of Harvard Yard and held it until my lungs ached.
And then, Harvard knocked the wind out of me.
I don’t know how or when it started. Weekend nights when all I could do was weep. Shooting through the glamor, the high rafters and thick rugs, was hostility. I was from the wrong place, did the wrong things, did not understand how I should be acting.
It is easy to slip into a crack here—a dark mahogany crack—and stay there, and not come out.
I’ve been asked a lot, as I’ve run all over the place this year talking about equity in undergraduate extracurricular life, why I care so much.
It’s just performance, people tell me. It’s just a social scene. It’s just pretend.
That, I think, is one of the biggest things that prevents social change: an honest misunderstanding of the stakes.
Because this place is not pretend. It is our lives. And it is where we learn the social and professional habits that will one day affect a lot of other people’s lives.
I need to tell you—and I am sure you, many of you, already know; in your guts and on your skin, in your tired bones—that classism, and sexism, and racism and ableism and homophobia don’t offend us. They build up in our bones. They are released every time we crack a joint like poison. They wear us down and down until we think it is better if we do not live.
Harvard, like the rest of the world, has a history and present of all of these things. But here, they wear a fancier disguise. Tradition. History. Prestige.
It is not harmless. It is the dazed mornings; it is the evenings I sobbed into the bath; it is the panic, and then relief, as you wait for a struggling friend to pick up the phone.  
Because it is the performance that get us. The we’re-just-kidding. The you-know-we’re-not-really-sexistracistableisthomophobic. The you-know-we’re-just-having-fun.
If hierarchy and exclusion, if performances of privilege that disallow deep diversity, if putting prestige over people is how we have fun at Harvard, then fuck our fun.
If prestige requires bulldozing people, I don’t want prestige.
But I don’t think it does.
I used to feel all shivery-shuddery, all filled with wild, ragged hope when I walked through Harvard Yard. After a Lamont all-nighter, the pink mist just starting to clear. In the years since, that feeling was replaced by frustration, criticism, rage.
This year, collaborating with you through this column, the old feeling has returned. But it’s different now. Because I realized something.
I realized that the thrill of possibility that used to shake my chest each time I stepped into Harvard Yard was nothing but the beating of my own heart.
And your heart. And all of our hearts. I used to want to take Harvard inside of me, breathing it in so I would be different, changed.
But I don’t think there really is anything magical in the air. I think the really magical thing is our own lungs.
Everything is not okay. Harvard has not divested from fossil fuels, we as a university are still not doing enough to acknowledge and combat racism, our sexual assault policy and practices are messed up, our campus is outrageously class-skewed, and I still feel like crap every time I walk down Mt. Auburn Street on a Saturday night.
But there’s a lot of energy right now on this campus. A willingness to have these discussions. The courage to make change.
Collaborating with you through this column has made me brave.
I hope it has made you brave, as well.
I hope we are brave enough to listen to the thing inside us that tells us the world can be different, and better, that we can make it better together. The thing that mourns and craves. That wants to take in everything and be everything and love everyone, and for all of it to be just.
I hope that feeling grows.
I hope that feeling pushes at our skin until it flowers from our mouths, until we sing it, until we are so filled with it that we burst forth into our own better world, right here, irresistibly, at this moment.
This feeling is anger and sadness, but it is also friendship.
It is the feeling of being in love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the news and the history behind it can make for depressing reading. In a year dominated by repeated instances of racial unrest in the United States and religious conflict in the Middle East, the influence of history feels particularly burdensome both at home and abroad.
A recent editorial in the New York Times entitled “How Racism Doomed Baltimore” perfectly encapsulates this sense. When the Times’ editorial board writes “racism,” it is referring not only to an attitude, but also to a decades-long historical process by which cities like Baltimore became as segregated as they are today, with all the implications for educational and economic opportunity that segregation entails. The current conflicts tearing apart the Islamic world have far older antecedents, in bitter divisions from periods of religious ferment over a millennium ago.
This idea that events from long before the people in today’s headlines were born set the stage for current controversies clearly contains a significant element of truth. But it is also often incomplete, and runs the risk of making current problems appear hopelessly intractable. True, economic inequality in urban communities of color is a direct result of racist housing policies from the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and '60s; but it also has to do with the ongoing implementation of incarceration policies that have had their worst effects in the past three decades. Former President Bill Clinton, to his credit, has admitted that the sentencing law he signed in 1994 contributed to the phenomenon of “missing men” in some communities. An in-depth analysis of the Founding Fathers is not necessary to uncover these more proximate reasons for the persistence of urban poverty.
Similarly, in the Middle East, though the seventh century roots of the Sunni-Shia split are essential to understanding entrenched conflict, one also cannot ignore the intervening 1400 years, during which nomadic groups swept through the region, empires like the Ottoman and Safavid rose and fell, and European powers ruled and then withdrew. To reduce all of the Islamic world’s problems to its beginnings ignores the influence of more recent developments like the rise of the Saudi state after World War I and the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979.
The relevance of more recent history in no way means that a search for fundamental trends from the more distant past is not worthwhile. After all, those housing policies from the 1930s and those divisions from the seventh century are still critical to understanding the current state of America’s urban core and the violence occurring in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.
But at every juncture from those events to the present, people had to make decisions about how to address the ideas and institutions they inherited. And while it may sometimes appear that our ancestors presided over an uninterrupted streak of poor choices, they occasionally got it right. A Congress in 1868 approved the 14th Amendment that then became the basis for future civil rights rulings in the 20th century; and, though the world has so far stood aside while ethnic slaughter takes place in Syria, it did intervene–albeit belatedly–in Bosnia.
Even the more depressing history of continued racism in urban housing policy offers clear lessons. After all, it shows how neighborhood organizations and municipalities have evaded federal laws, and suggests that seemingly innocuous policies like minimum sentencing can have enormous unintended consequences.
In short, while looking for root causes, we cannot ignore the role of contingency and choice. Consider the history of school segregation. In 1954, the Supreme Court made a great step towards ending the practice; twenty years later, in a five to four decision, it essentially undid any successful desegregation programs by quashing attempts to deal with the de facto segregation caused by white flight. One changed vote, and we might be having a different conversation about race and education in the United States.
The lessons of the Arab Spring are similar. In Tunisia, the movement’s originator, the success of a functioning, pluralist democracy is still a very real, if fragile, possibility, thanks largely to the good sense of the country’s major political movements. In Egypt, the incompetence of an Islamist President and the heavy-handedness of the military led to very different results. As always, the decisions of key players were crucial, seventh century legacies notwithstanding.
History gives us reason for cautious optimism. Long-standing prejudice and ancient dogma remain central to understanding current problems; but the role of individual and collective decision-making cannot be ignored. Baltimore may be reeling from nearly a century of bad housing and criminal justice policies, and the Middle East may appear to be in an endless cycle of violence, but neither place was, or is, “doomed” by its past.
This semester, the goal of this column has been to look at different ways that history can inform our perspective on the present. Sometimes, those lessons were clear: Rudy Giuliani clearly knows not whereof he speaks when he calls the President “anti-colonial.”  More often, looking back at the accumulation of prejudice and violence that makes up a good portion of human history can seem like an exercise in hopelessness. But it needn’t be. Today, choices are being made that have the potential to build on past successes and correct past mistakes. With an eye towards history, we can make sure those choices are for the better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 14, 2015, at 9:54 p.m.
Francis J. Doyle III, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of California at Santa Barbara, will lead the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences as its next dean starting August 1, taking the helm in the midst of the school’s scheduled move to Allston.
Doyle takes the place of interim SEAS Dean and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, who has been in the position since January, after former SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray officially stepped down.
Doyle will oversee the school’s $450 million capital campaign and its scheduled move across the Charles River to Allston, to which two thirds of SEAS faculty are slated to relocate in 2019.
Doyle is also associate dean for research at UCSB’s College of Engineering and the chair of chemical engineering at the school. His systems biology lab, currently based in Santa Barbara, Calif., will move to Cambridge in August, according to the lab’s website.
“[Frank] brings to the deanship a keen understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing schools of engineering and applied sciences today,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, who selected Doyle for the post, said in a press release Thursday.
Donald E. Ingber, a bioengineering professor who sat on the SEAS dean search committee, noted Doyle’s experience directing an institute that spans across multiple campuses and many faculty, the Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies.
Doyle is “an experienced administrator who seems to be very good at dealing with diverse communities and institutions,” Ingber said. “A a time when Harvard is expanding into Allston, I think that will be a great advantage.”
Engineering professor Robert D. Howe, who was a member of the search’s advisory committee, said that Doyle will be the first SEAS dean who is an engineer by training, which he said he thinks denotes a growing emphasis on the engineering aspect of SEAS. He also added that the last two deans of SEAS have been appointed from outside of the Harvard faculty.
According to Professor of Atmospheric and Environmental Science Steven C. Wofsy, Doyle has experience in fundraising, but he would not specify what type of experience. Members of the search committee said that they looked specifically for experience in fundraising when assessing different candidates, and that all of the finalists had some degree of fundraising experience.
“He has the kind of vision and winning personality which I think make him an exceptional fundraiser,” Howe said.
The SEAS dean search advisory committee, which was comprised of about 15 faculty members from across SEAS, spent the past semester surveying a wide pool of candidates and eventually made recommendations to Smith.
Alejandro J. Laguna Sanz, a postdoctoral fellow at Doyle’s research lab, said he thinks Doyle will be successful managing SEAS given his prior work at UCSB.
“He is an exceptional leader and manager,” Sanz said.
He added that members of the lab are still deciding whether they will relocate to Cambridge along with Doyle.
Doyle and Lewis were both unavailable for comment by press time due to travel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three College alumni spoke about the road to creating and producing the award-winning film “Whiplash” at panel introduced by University President Drew G. Faust on Wednesday.
The movie, which Faust called “astonishing,” touches upon the relationship between teaching and learning, the pursuit of perfection, and the role that mentor figures play in shaping the lives of young people.
Damien S. Chazelle ’07, a former Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, wrote and directed the film about a prodigy-drummer (Miles Teller) and his violently overbearing teacher (J.K. Simmons). Helen C. Estabrook ’03 and Nicholas J. Britell ’03 served as producers.
Faust referenced the overwhelmingly positive reviews that “Whiplash” received when it premiered in October 2014 and said that the movie raises questions about academic relationships between teachers and their students who strive for excellence.
“How far is too far?” Faust asked, indicating potential questions that arise around the teacher-student relationship and how best to motivate students. “When do we come into our own...and at what costs?”
A couple clips from “Whiplash” punctuated the conversation among Chazelle, Estabrook, Britell, and moderator and VES Department Chair Robb Moss, who taught Chazelle as an undergraduate.
In response to Moss’s questions, Chazelle spoke about the road to creating “Whiplash,” which started as a shorter-length project that he took to a film festival. The short film, Chazelle said, became “this piece of currency” which he could use to show people in the industry his idea for a longer piece.
Estabrook said the team thus took a “look, here, let me show you 15 minutes” approach toward pitching the film that ultimately became “Whiplash.”
Working from a fully-formed work, however, posed several challenges for Chazelle and his team.
In one scene, in which Simmons’s character abusively criticizes an out-of-tune musician, Chazelle found himself trying to recreate the shorter version’s take when filming what became “Whiplash.”
“In my mind what existed was this polished [shorter version],” Chazelle said. “Suddenly you’re faced with raw materials.”
“You’re trying to forget the earlier scene, but you can’t,” he added.
“Whiplash” in its final form explored the “sweaty, sexy” musical genre that is jazz, a genre that over the years has become reduced to a genteel background soundtrack at cocktail parties and museum galleries, according to Chazelle. The skills of filmmaking that Chazelle learned in VES, which he described as a department where “you put a camera on your shoulder, and you see what you capture,” influenced the feel of the movie, he said.
“I wanted to feel that it had been shot and edited by the conductor [of a jazz band],” Chazelle said.

Amid more public concerns over BGLTQ support in Dunster House, at least 160 students have signed a petition calling for the reinstatement of current resident tutor Avik Chatterjee, whom many students have praised for his role as BGLTQ advocate and ally.
A group of Dunster students circulated the petition on Sunday and on Monday met with Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde.
Chatterjee, who has served as a resident tutor in Dunster for the past two years, applied to stay on as a tutor but was not asked back by House administrators. Dunster House Masters Roger B. and Ann Porter previously told The Crimson that they did not hire back any tutors who are graduating this year. Chatterjee is completing his program at the School of Public Health this spring.
Concerns over BGLTQ support in Dunster House have come to a head this past semester more publicly than in the past, with students and tutors raising concerns about the resources devoted to BGLTQ programming there, as reported by The Crimson last week.
After they responded to The Crimson’s inquiries about BGLTQ advising in Dunster, the Porters invited Dunster students to a confidential meeting about BGLTQ life in the House last week, and several students prepared a written petition in advance of the meeting with more than 100 signatures calling for Chatterjee to remain as a resident tutor.
Roger Porter declined to comment on the issue on Thursday, citing College policy against discussing personnel matters. However, he wrote in an email that House administrators benefitted from their discussion with Dunster students last week.
Since the meeting last week, several students have circulated an electronic petition in preparation of meetings with College administrators. As of Tuesday, the petition had collected 160 signatures along with 128 comments in support of Chatterjee’s return to the House.
Chatterjee said he was surprised by the petition and was not involved with it in any way.
Students presented the petition to Lassonde in a meeting on Monday. Spencer D. Dunleavy ’17, one of the students organizing it, said Lassonde seemed sympathetic at the meeting, but that he indicated that the students needed to follow up with the Porters.
Chatterjee said he also met with Lassonde.
Lassonde wrote in an email that he met with students from Dunster House on Monday and that they had a “very thoughtful discussion about House life and their aspirations for the Dunster community," but declined to comment further.
According to Dunleavy, students have scheduled a meeting with the Porters for next week.
Alejandro R. Ashworth ’17, another student involved in the petition, said he is optimistic that the Porters might consider Chatterjee for a non-residential tutor position, perhaps with increased access to the House, such as additional meal swipes.
“He does have such a large role in the lives of students,” Ashworth said. “I think it’s in all of our best interests to have Avik back in some capacity.”
Chatterjee, for his part, said "in an ideal world if nearly half of the students in a House are giving clear reasons for a move that would improve student life...they would be listened to."
In an emailed statement, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote that his administration takes very seriously any concerns raised by students about BGLTQ support in the Houses. While he declined to comment on "specific personnel situations," he acknowledged that Lassonde had met with students and said the College “will continue to work with Houses to ensure they have the resources needed to support" undergraduates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a year in which 45 percent of incoming freshmen were female, the gender ratio of incoming students will return to near even figures for the Class of 2019. About 81 percent of students admitted to the College's Class of 2019 plan to matriculate to Harvard, roughly even with the yield rates of the past two years.
The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid also expects to admit about 60 to 70 applicants from the waitlist in the coming weeks, marking a slight uptick from the 20 students they intended to accept from the waitlist at this time last year.
“It’s actually almost ideal,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview. “It would be really nice to admit somewhere between 50 and 100 people off the waitlist because there are so many people at the edge who are terrific."
According to Fitzsimmons, the yield rate for female students also rose this year, from about 81 percent last year to 82 percent. The relative increase in women enrolling at the College follows efforts by the Office of Admissions to revamp the publications sent out to prospective students, making them more gender-inclusive.
Although he said his office found the return to near gender parity for the incoming freshman class was “very encouraging,” Fitzsimmons cautioned against making any judgments based on only a couple years.
“It’s not anything that we’re sitting back and congratulating ourselves on. In our business, you need three to five years of solid results before you can say anything with even a bit of certainty,” he said.
The Class of 2019 will reflect similar ethnic and racial breakdowns as the class of 2018, with a slight increase in the proportion of Asian-American, Latino, African-American, and Native American students, who comprise more than 21 percent, about 12, 11, and 1.6 percent of the class, respectively. Last May, about 21 percent of the incoming class was Asian-American and 10.5 percent were African-American.
The number of incoming students who applied for financial aid increased about 2 percent this year, from 62 percent to more than 64 percent, reflecting what Fitzsimmons predicted will be a larger trend in the coming years, given national economic trends.
“You’re going to see more and more emphasis and need for financial aid,” he said.
The number of matriculating students who indicated interest in humanities concentrations also rose this year from about 14.1 to 15.4 percent of the incoming class. At 83 percent, the yield rate for prospective humanities concentrators was higher than the average yield rate, as has been the trend in previous years, according to Fitzsimmons.
He specifically lauded the work of Diana Sorensen, the divisional dean for the arts and humanities, during the College’s visiting program last month, adding that the opening of the University's renovated art museums and introduction of a new concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media will likely continue to spark interest in the humanities.
“We’re certainly doubling down on the humanities here in many, many ways,” Fitzsimmons said.
More than 40 students so far have indicated plans to defer their admission, a figure Fitzsimmons said he felt was a “high number” for this time of year.
Harvard accepted a record-low 5.3 percent of applicants to the Class of 2019, including 997 students admitted under its early action program. The regular acceptance rate was 2.8 percent.
Two other Ivy League institutions have also recently reported yield rates.
Sixty-six percent of those admitted to the University of Pennsylvania are expected to matriculate. Princeton saw a 69 percent yield rate, the highest in the university’s history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the 754 students at the College that hail from countries outside the U.S., more than 30 attended United World Colleges—a conglomerate of now 14 boarding schools founded in 1962 that purposefully aims to bring together students from different cultural backgrounds—according to the Harvard International Office.
Located around the world in places like the U.S., Germany, Hong Kong, India, Norway, Swaziland, and the United Kingdom, UWC hosts students from about 80 different countries at a school and operates national committees in more than 147 countries through which prospective students can apply.
Jessika S. Nebrat ’18, a former UWC-USA student, said the diverse student body contributed to a vibrant and nuanced education inside the classroom.
“You can be in history class talking about a specific topic and someone from that country will say, ‘Oh actually, this is how we learned that,'” Nebrat said. “It gives added perspective to the conversation.”
UWC students at Harvard also said experiences outside the classroom led to cross-cultural exchanges through the friendships they formed.
“I come from a small city in Chile but was always interested in traveling. Going to UWC and meeting people from cultures so different from my own really inspired me to understand others,” said Constanza M. Vidal Bustamante ’16, a graduate of UWC South East Asia in Singapore and former president of the Harvard UWC Club.
With about 4 percent of international students at the College having previously attended UWC, the unique, cross-cultural environment of the schools both appeals to Harvard admissions officers and leads to a community of former UWC students upon entering the College.
VENTURING OUT
Eight members of the Class of 2018 graduated from UWC schools, according to the Davis UWC Scholars Program website. UWC graduates who matriculate at certain U.S. colleges or universities, including Harvard, are selected as Davis UWC Scholars. Senior Admissions Officer Janet Irons, who oversees UWC student applications at Harvard, said that because UWC students often venture from their own communities to a boarding school abroad, UWC students display a predisposition to think globally, which aligns closely with Harvard’s own educational goals.
“Harvard seeks to educate students who are broadminded about the world, are open to different points of view and work in a productive way to solve world problems, and I think UWC helps foster those worthy goals,” Irons said.
Irons added that International Baccalaureate program taught at UWC schools is also “a strong and appropriate preparation” for Harvard.
“If they do well in that academic environment, then there is a very good chance they’ll do well at Harvard,” Irons said.
The Davis UWC Scholars Program—the world’s largest global scholarship fund for undergraduates founded in 2000 by philanthropist Shelby M.C. Davis and Philip O. Geier, president of UWC-USA at the time—awards scholarships to over 2500 Davis UWC Scholars, working with 91 undergraduate institutions.
The Davis scholarships make the U.S. an attractive destination after graduation for UWC students, although many also go to the United Kingdom and other countries, according to Paul G. Stainier ’18, a former UWC India student.
“Each partner school in the program, like Harvard, combines Davis grant funding with its own financial aid to ensure that each Davis UWC Scholar is awarded as large a scholarship as necessary to meet their need, as determined by the partner school’s financial aid analysis,” Geier wrote in an email.
Irons added that while Harvard is need-blind to international admits, the Davis UWC Scholarships are important at colleges where there is a limited pool of scholarships to international students, making UWC students more attractive to colleges and can have a “huge impact” on the success of getting into an American university.
However, Nebrat said the emphasis of UWC is not college prep-oriented, instead focused on preparing future globally engaged leaders across disciplines. She added that the application process to UWC was far more geared toward choosing individuals interested in contributing to the diverse environment at UWC than those who sought places in Ivy Leagues.
“Boarding schools in the United States are often perceived as prep schools, and UWC tries very hard not to be,” Nebrat said. “It ends up being so much more than that. You don’t get the full experience otherwise.”
UWC AT HARVARD
At Harvard, former UWC students continue to form strong friendships over their shared experience of attending one of the 14 international boarding schools across five continents. Stainier noted a general trend of former UWC students blocking together; his own blocking group of eight has three former UWC students.
Colin J.F. Diersing ’16, a graduate from Li Po Chun UWC, credits the formative experience of UWC as a launch pad for friendships between former UWC students at Harvard.
“There’s definitely something to be said about the friendships that are formed around UWC at Harvard,” Diersing said. “A lot of my first friends at Harvard and still some of my closest are from UWC.”
The Harvard UWC Club organizes regular brunches to continue fostering friendships among UWC graduates. Diersing also said a new “buddy program," in which Harvard freshmen from UWC are paired with upperclassmen in the club to help their transition, has been established this year.
In an effort to maintain the strong sense of UWC community after graduation, Vidal Bustamante co-chaired a conference, entitled “Intercultural and Interconnected: The Power of Social Capital in Culturally Diverse Communities," organized by the Harvard UWC Club in March 2014.
Even after UWC, the schools make education a “force to unite," Vidal Bustamante said. “That’s the magic of UWC. Even though we didn’t go to the same school, there was some immediate connection."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 15, 2015, at 4:42 p.m.
During his time as head of public markets in 2013, since-promoted Harvard Management Company president and CEO Stephen Blyth received $11.5 million in compensation, roughly double his compensation in the previous year, when he earned $5.3 million.
According to 2013 Internal Revenue Service tax filings, top HMC executives saw significant rises in compensation, which is determined on a performance-based system linked to overall investment performance.
In the 2013 calendar year, former Harvard Management Company president Jane L. Mendillo earned $9.6 million, significantly less than Blyth, who served under her leadership at the time, but a nearly $5 million dollar raise from her 2012 earnings of $4.8 million. Mendillo stepped down from Harvard’s investment arm in 2014 after serving a six-year tenure in the top position.
Other HMC executives also brought in millions more than in previous years. Natural resources portfolio managers Alvaro Aguirre-Simunovic earned $9.6 million, up from his 2012 earnings of about $6.6 million. Head of alternative assets Andrew G. Wiltshire made $8.5 million in 2013, compared to $7.9 million in 2012.
The IRS Form 990 filing, which is required by all tax-exempt organizations, records the salaries of University officers and other top earners.
University President Drew G. Faust was paid $1,112,149 in 2013, more than a $100,000 increase from her 2012 total earnings. Faust was compensated a $784,533 salary as well as benefits—including the presidential residence at 33 Elmwood Ave. in Cambridge. She also earned a $75,000 salary and $175,000 in stock options for serving on the board of Staples, Inc.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 made a salary of $622,341, receiving a total package of $808,343.
Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier earned the highest salary compensation of the University deans listed, making $603,542. Julio Frenk, the outgoing dean of the School of Public Health, earned a $574,301 salary, while Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith received a salary of $494,801.
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria earned a salary of $552,501 and a total package of $696,803.
Former vice president for public affairs and communications Christine M. Heenan, who departed from her position in February 2015, received $441,384 in total earnings, a slight decrease from her 2012 $447,910 total package. Harvard’s executive vice president Katherine N. Lapp earned a total package of $657,955, and general counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 received a total of $557,165 in 2013, among the highest earners of University administrators. Vice President for Alumni Affairs Tamara E. Rogers earned a total package of $432,927 during Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign.

This story has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 15, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly implied that University President Drew G. Faust's compensation from Staples, Inc. is included in her Harvard compensation. In fact, it does not count toward her $1.1 million total package from Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has filed a copyright lawsuit against a number of commercial websites that are allegedly selling materials intended to prepare students to pass online course exams on HBX—Harvard Business School’s digital learning platform.
Harvard alleges that the test sale sites accessed and copied exams on HBX’s CORe, or Credential of Readiness, program that provides introductory business courses for students and professionals not enrolled in the Business School, according to the complaint the University filed on April 29. It goes on to say that the preparatory materials offered by the websites “are either identical or substantially similar to Harvard’s copyrighted exam question and answers.”
Harvard alleges that it has suffered more than $75,000 in losses as a result of the infringements on its CORe program, which is designed and taught by Business School faculty and staff.
The defendants, which are a group of currently unnamed individuals referred to as John Does 1-20 in the complaint, operate over 50 Internet domains, including “Certkiller.com,” “Testking.com,” “Certgenie.com,” and “Pass4sure.com.”
Harvard is requesting that the defendants pay damages and illegal profits back to Harvard and that the domain names listed be transferred to Harvard, according to the lawsuit. Harvard also plans to name the people selling the test prep material when it identifies them.
“We are making a clear statement that we will not tolerate test piracy or use of pirated materials by filing the lawsuit,” Business School spokesperson Jim Aisner ’68 wrote in a statement. He added that HBX plans to take measures to prevent copyright infringement in the future.
Viewed as a success by students and staff in part because of an initial 85 percent completion rate and student evaluations comparable to those of in-class evaluations given to Harvard Business School MBA students, the year-old CORe program has grown significantly since its inauguration. In February, HBX expanded its CORe to students worldwide, and it has since looked to partner with other universities to reserve a certain number of spots in the online class, including Amherst College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­There was once a time when thousands packed London’s White City Stadium—one of the iconic sporting venues of the early 20th century—to watch the athletes of the Harvard track and field team compete alongside their compatriots from Yale against the combined forces of Oxford and Cambridge.
Today, the biannual meet, described by its hosts as “the oldest continuous amateur athletic competition in the world,” no longer contains that same luster. The crowds have dwindled, and the meet itself is no longer hosted in historic arenas like White City Stadium and New York’s Berkeley Oval; instead, it alternates between the four institutions.
The decrease in popularity has coincided with changing attitudes toward the role of athletics at universities on both sides of the Atlantic. Although times and distances have improved dramatically over the years, the athletes in the meet no longer have so solid a claim to athletic royalty in England and America.
Despite all the changes, the meet still holds a special place on the calendar and in the hearts of student-athletes: It is the only opportunity for them to compete alongside their rivals while engaging in new, broadened social and cultural interactions.
A CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
After the Elis—a national track and field powerhouse in the late 19th century—lost to the Oxonians in London in 1894 and defeated the Cantabrigians in New York the following year, Harvard teamed up with its Ancient Eight rival to challenge a joint British conglomerate. According to John L. Thorndike ’49, a former hammer thrower for Harvard who later served as chair of the graduate committee that oversees the American side of the event, it was then that the meet became a formal event.
“Some enthusiastic alumni from both colleges got excited about [the meet] after the Yale team had had a very successful trip,” Thorndike said. “[They] decided to have a joint team in the future, and that’s the way it’s been for…[more than] 40 [meets].”
The catalyst for the competition originated in England: The chancellors of Oxford and Cambridge issued a challenge to the American representatives at Harvard and Yale, who promptly accepted.
The biannual nature of the meet has been interrupted at various points, most notably during the decade-long gap between 1911 and 1921 due to tensions surrounding World War I. But since then, the event has occurred with greater regularity, giving the pool of Harvard and Yale athletes the unique experience to travel across the pond and partake in the culture of their competitors before meeting head-to-head for bragging rights every two years.
When the competition first began, each meet was a highly anticipated and closely watched event. The very first running in 1899 drew 8,000 spectators, including the Prince of Wales, the American ambassador, and the leader of the House of Commons.
The Boston Herald reported every detail of the meet, beginning at the moment the Harvard and Yale athletes set sail for England. According to The Crimson, the Herald's first headline, “College Team Sails. Harvard and Yale Off for England as One. Wildly Cheered as the Steamer Moves Out,” depicted a scene of fan supporting the rival athletes at they were sent off towards the British Isles.
AMERICAN DOMINATION
The early editions of the competition were largely close battles: The Oxonians and Cantabrigians came away with a 5-4 victory over the Americans in the very first competition. Over the next 60 years, the British side would win eight more times, while the Crimson and Bulldogs took seven meets of their own.
The 1959 edition of the meet highlighted that parity: The Crimson’s report of the 1959 meet records that “the British performers were surprisingly inept in the field events” but that “the wispy English distance runners ran circles around their larger American opponents.”
But that meet—which ended in an 8-7 victory for the Americans—would mark the beginning of a shift in the balance in power, which has tilted in favor of the Ivies in nearly every facet of the competition. This dominance has been reflected even in the distance events, in which the British had long been considered superior.
Since 1959, the Oxford/Cambridge team has emerged victorious only twice, in 1993 and in 2009, against 22 victories for the Crimson and Bulldogs. This can be traced, in part, to the divergent paths that athletic endeavors have taken within American and British university culture.
While American universities like Harvard and Yale recruit athletes from around the nation, their British counterparts are typically constrained to the depth of their respective club teams, having chosen to focus their university resources on academic endeavors as opposed to funding full-fledged athletic programs.
Whereas American universities are able to recruit the best athletes dedicated to their respective sports from around the nation, and these competitors go into their collegiate careers knowing they will dedicate time and effort to their crafts, the system is different in Britain, where the role of athletic clubs is more informal.
Instead of recruited undergraduates from around the British Isles, the teams are composed of students who wish to be a part of the club. This often means that squads will be composed of people from a variety of ages, experience levels, and backgrounds. Fifth-year senior Hannah Mayer—who traveled to England in 2011—recalls one British athlete in particular who embodied this.
“There’s a mix of people considering on the team at Oxford and Cambridge, they can have graduate students, Ph.D. students, really old people,” Mayer said. “There [was] a guy...he was an almost 40-year-old guy who threw hammer…. He was so strong, and he had rowed for Cambridge…. He was such a character.”
Additionally, unlike their American counterparts—who spend millions of dollars funding recruiting trips, professional coaches’ salaries, and travel—the British teams are coached by volunteers, and they do not receive money from the English schools despite competing under their names. Thus, track and field is seen as more of an extracurricular on the side of academics, unlike in the United States, where recruited athletes balance academics and athletics side by side.
“We have just a lot more infrastructure,” Saretsky said. “Something I believe very strongly is that academics and athletics go hand in hand, and they really complement each other.”
MORE THAN JUST A TRACK MEET
While Oxford and Cambridge have struggled to obtain success in recent years, both teams still put aside any rivalries in order to fiercely compete against the Harvard-Yale contingent of athletes.
The Achilles Club—founded in 1920 and made up of past and present members of the Oxford and Cambridge University Athletics Clubs—sponsors the meet for the English sides; the arrangement is one made less out of love and more out of pragmatism, but it is also a sign of the cooperation that can emerge even between bitter adversaries.
According to those involved, the social component of the meet—the ability to bond and become friends with not only conference foes but international rivals as well—has become one of the most important aspects of the experience.
“What’s important is the transformative experience of interacting with our peers, our brethren across the pond that are in similar academic institutions and also share a passion for a sport we care so much about,” Saretsky said.
When the British competitors stay in the United States, they are afforded the opportunity to stay in the Ivy host school’s dorms; this allows them to briefly immerse themselves in the daily lives of their American counterparts and gain a small taste of what their collegiate experience is like. The experience is very similar when the Americans set course for England as well.
In 1959, the British hosts were particularly welcoming in their invitations to the Harvard and Yale students to explore London’s myriad watering holes, though some Americans perceived the gesture as an attempt at mental warfare.
While intimidation might have been the goal of some earlier interactions, however, the cultural exchange between the two sides has always served as a highlight of the meet. Thorndike agreed, arguing that the biggest takeaway from the event throughout its history has not been the nationalistic bragging rights, the trophy, or even the competition itself.
This attitude and appreciation for the social aspect of the meet has remained constant throughout its history.
In a recap of the very first meet, the July 24, 1899, issue of The Times made note of the attendance made by then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Joseph H. Choate at a banquet following the meet.
“[Choate] had learnt that afternoon that representatives of the two nations could engage in a heated and ardent controversy and fight it out and yet be good friends,” the Times said.
FRATERNIZING WITH THE ENEMY
One of the most noteworthy aspects of the competition is the opportunity for Harvard athletes not only to compete against British athletes, but to train, eat, and live with their Yale counterparts when they visit the British Isles.
While the new interactions—in light of the bitter rivalry the schools are part of—have often led to awkward or competitive situations between the two Ivy squads, they also serve to develop new friendships.
Based on her own experience, Mayer agreed, saying that the dynamic between the Yale and Harvard athletes was not one of animosity, but rather one of support and friendship.
“We had them train with us everyday, throwing, lifting, and everything,” Mayer said. “It was a really fun experience. We got to know each other really well, and even during the competition...we’re all cheering for the Yale team as well as the Harvard team because we had a united uniform.”
Following the competition, the athletes from all four teams come together to enjoy a banquet provided by the host schools. The event gives athletes one last chance to interact with one another as the competitors from the four teams are arranged such that they only sit next to athletes from other schools.
Though the banquets end after the American teams return back home, the new friendships made overseas tend to carry over. Since Harvard and Yale compete against each other annually, the Crimson athletes get more opportunities to see their Yale compatriots. While the Elis are still considered bitter rivals on the track, there is a new element of friendship involved in seeing them again.
“Just because we’re from rival schools, it doesn’t really mean anything,” Mayer said. “You can relate to one another really easily, so once you just get over that hump that ‘this person is from Yale’...they’re just one of the team[mates] and one of your friends.”
DWINDLING IMPORTANCE
Though the athletes are able to gain a valuable experience, the media attention surrounding the meet has disappeared, and the nationalistic fervor is gone too. Whereas the pride of American athletics was once at stake, there is now much less on the line.
Thorndike himself has witnessed the dwindling importance of the competition over the last few decades.
“It’s not vital anymore, [but] it once was quite important when the pride of the different teams was important,” Thorndike said. “The main point of it [now] is [that] participants... get a chance to travel and see the other part of the world.”
In addition, the athletic quality—in relation to the rest of the nation—on display at the event has dwindled since its heyday in the early 1900s.
Though the schools hosted a number of collegiate athletes who competed at an elite level as late as the mid-20th century—such as Harvard’s Ned Gourdin ’21, who set a world record in the long jump at the 1921 meet, and Crimson hammer thrower and two-time Olympian Sam Felton ’48—there has been a shift in athletic power over the years. While Harvard has made splashes in recruiting recently, most elite athletes who go on to be Olympians take their talents to Power Five conferences such as the SEC or Pac-12.
Today’s landscape contrasts to that which the athletes competing in the first edition of the meet found themselves in; Harvard and Yale produced four medal-winning athletes at the 1896 Athens Olympics just three years prior to the meet.
“Back in the 1890s and 1900s, two or three competitors from each team, Harvard and Yale, were on the Olympic teams,” Thorndike said. “Now they no longer are because people that can do those times and distances don’t come to Harvard and Yale…. The same in England, there’s very few Oxford and Cambridge people on the British [Olympic] team.”
Saretsky said he believes that the decreased attention towards the event is correlated with the diminished spotlight on track and field as a whole. With track and field becoming a sport spotlighted only during the Olympics, it lacks the national audience required to garner fanfare.
“Many years ago, the stadium would be filled for a track meet, and that’s obviously no longer the case,” Saretsky said. “Across the U.S.—and globally—our sport has really become an Olympic sport where it’s once every four years that we’re put under the spotlight.”
While the competition might not carry the same weight it once did in terms of athletic prowess, the spirit and social interactions associated with the meet have not diminished.
Ambassador Choate’s observation of friendship has been preserved in the face of the dwindling attention which both the event and the sport have received recently. This has allowed generations of Crimson athletes to obtain a unique and exciting experience which very few collegiate athletes have a chance to receive.
“I think it’s awesome to be a part of all the history and the tradition,” Saretsky said. “We’re very fortunate in our sport that we have the opportunity to have this sort of experience.”
