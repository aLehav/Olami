After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playa Bowls, an açaí bowl shop, opened its first Cambridge location on Mt. Auburn Street Saturday.
Located at 71 Mt. Auburn Street, Playa Bowls serves customizable açaí and pitaya bowls, as well as juices and smoothies.
Playa Bowls Partner Dana Nentin said in a press release that the company was excited to bring “a healthy, fresh and delicious food option to this young, vibrant city.”
Some of the most popular items on their menu include the Pura Vida açaí bowl and the Nutella açaí bowl, Nentin said in an interview. The store also allows customers to create their own bowls.
“We do always recommend checking out some of our other bases — we offer pitaya, coconut, banana, chia, green bases,” she said. “You even have the opportunity to mix things up, so you could do half açaí half pitaya. Every bowl in our store is customizable.”
Due to the pandemic, Playa Bowls is currently not offering any indoor or outdoor seating but is open for take-out.
Denise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said Playa Bowls brings a unique concept to the Square.
“I don't think we have anything quite like this,” Jillson said. “They're just delicious bowls, healthy bowls…with all kinds of toppings. They have gluten free, vegan, seeds and flakes and extracts and fruit. It just goes on and on.”
Playa Bowls is a national franchise with three locations in Massachusetts including the store in Harvard Square. Several former Boston College alumni own the Boston-area stores. Nentin said the time the proprietors spent in Cambridge as undergraduates led them to pursue a location in Harvard Square.
“We decided we really wanted to bring this to Harvard Square [after] just going there a lot back in college and now, it's a great area, great town. You have the support of the students and local businesses, and it was a place that was really high on our list to bring Playa Bowls as well,” Nentin said.
Nentin said Playa Bowls is focused on attracting more than just college students.
“I think the brand caters to everyone,” she said. “We found in other stores, by being outside of large colleges and universities, a lot of our clientele is college students, but we do cater to everyone. We do get people in from local suburbs — even a bit further away. Some people will travel to our stores to try us out.”
Playa Bowls was originally founded by two New Jersey surfers — Abby Taylor and Rob Giuliani — in an effort to recreate açaí and pitaya bowls they had tried on surf trips throughout the United States and Latin America. The pair opened Playa Bowls in New Jersey in 2014. The Boston-area Playa Bowls locations have been open since 2019.
The Harvard Square location is the 96th Playa Bowls store in the country. The other Massachusetts stores are near Boston College and Northeastern University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The city of Cambridge plans to expedite a number of planned pedestrian safety measures — including a separated bike line — following a fatal crash in Harvard Square last week.
On Aug. 18, a male bicyclist in his 50s or 60s was struck and killed by a tractor-trailer near the Out of Town News kiosk. His death sparked criticism online, and Cambridge residents called for the city to take measures to protect cyclists.
The new bike lane is set to run on Massachusetts Avenue from Dunster Street towards Church Street. In addition, the city will reduce the number of travel lanes on Massachusetts Avenue between the kiosk and Harvard Yard. The updates will be made using “quick-build” materials, according to a city press release.
The city plans to implement the new measures in the next two weeks, according to a tweet from Cambridge Vice-Mayor Alanna M. Mallon.
Cambridge has long planned a number of safety measures to update Harvard Square for bicyclists. In October 2015, the city released Cambridge’s Bicycle Plan, aiming to make “all streets bicycle friendly.” Since then, at least three bicyclists have been killed in collisions with larger vehicles.
The bike lane and the reduced traffic lanes were originally planned as components of the city’s Harvard Square kiosk renovations, but the project was postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Mallon praised the city’s new plan on Twitter but urged the city to take further action on safety measures.
“I'm hopeful that these projects will better protect Cambridge's cyclists & restore a feeling of safety, but City action can't stop at these quick-build improvements, or at the borders of Harvard Square. I look forward to implementing the cycling safety ordinance in Sept,” Mallon wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last days of August normally see Harvard Yard filled with late summer tourists, chaotic crowds of freshmen, and exuberant upperclassmen excited to reunite with friends. This year, campus has become quiet as a handful of masked students enter the dorms to begin a near-unrecognizable semester in residence.
In July, the College announced all undergraduate classes would be taught virtually and invited freshmen — in addition to upperclassmen with extenuating circumstances — to spend the fall semester on campus. Though Harvard initially estimated that up to 40 percent of all undergraduates would be welcomed back, as of early August, administrators projected that only 25 percent of students would return to Harvard’s dorms.
Students invited to live in residence began trickling into campus this Sunday, arriving at pre-assigned times staggered throughout the week. Before settling into their assigned dorm rooms and beginning their mandated period of quarantine, undergraduates had to complete a highly regimented series of tasks within two hours: undergoing testing, picking up their keys and a day’s worth of pre-packaged meals, and moving into their dorms.
Undergraduates had to begin their time on campus with a visit to a large tent in the Science Center Plaza during their assigned move-in window. There, they began what will soon become a thrice-weekly ritual for students in residence: testing for COVID-19.
Prior to their arrival, students must create an account with Color, a University-sanctioned testing company. After students activate their testing kit at the tent, medical professionals on site walk students through the testing process: using a swab to twist inside both their nostrils several times and placing the swab in a capsule.
Elias E. Q. DeLeon ’23 said the employees at the testing area took “stringent” measures to curb cross-contamination during the testing process.
“We had to use hand sanitizer before and after we opened the bag to get the vial. They were six feet apart behind the table,” he said. “There was a bin where you would peel something off or take something out of the bag and then leave it in that bin and then they would clean it in between each person.”
After completing their tests, several recently moved-in students said they received a wristband indicating they had been tested. They could then pick up bagged meals for their first 24 hours on campus, including lunch, dinner, breakfast, and snacks.
“It was super organized and quick,” Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 said. “There was music playing, and [Dean of Students] Katie O’Dair and [Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean] Claudine Gay were there. I felt it was a very nice way to welcome the people who are coming back to campus.”
Albert W. Zhang ’24, an incoming freshman, said Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and University President Lawrence S. Bacow were also present at the testing station when he went through on Monday.
Until students receive a negative result on their initial test, they may only leave their suite to use the restroom or in the event of an emergency.
After receiving a negative result, usually within 24 hours of their test, students enter phase two of their mandated quarantine. They can then begin picking up to-go meals from their dining halls and visit outside areas adjacent to their dorm for up to 30 minutes at a time. To complete this phase, students must undergo testing using kits placed in their rooms two additional times, on their fourth and seventh days on campus.
If those two tests come back negative, students are then free to move about campus while adhering to College health and safety guidance. A student who receives a positive test result, by contrast, will receive instructions from Harvard University Health Services about how to self-isolate.
“We have to wear masks. We can't congregate obviously. We can't invite people into our dorms, or else we'll get a red card, which basically means you'll get in trouble,” C. Angela Dela Cruz ’24 said. “The consequences haven't been determined yet and, honestly, nobody wants to find out.”
Raphaëlle Soffe ’21, who spent the last few months on campus, said the process of moving out of her summer housing, which will now serve as an isolation unit, was arduous.
With only a short hour window to make six or seven trips between the buildings, she said the process was “very stressful.”
“The elevators were cramped,” she said. “If their point was to avoid having people clustered together, the opposite happened because everyone was in the elevator at that particular point.”
Despite these challenges, Soffe said she noticed logistical improvements in the College’s testing machinery since the summer. While waiting for testing could previously take as long as 90 minutes, Soffe said it took her just 10 minutes to get re-tested and join her new housing “bubble.”
“I think they figured out that there’s just too high a demand,” she said.
Zhang also said he thought the testing process went “really smoothly.”
Still, he added that moving in did bring some logistical challenges. A bevy of upperclassmen normally guide freshmen to their rooms, but a lost Zhang said he eventually resorted to Googling the building’s online work plan to navigate.
His older brother Bill W. Zhang ’21, who is also spending the semester on campus, said when there were unforeseen hitches in administrators’ careful plans, students stepped up to maintain a safe dynamic.
The first night after move-in, for example, the elder Zhang said the fire alarm in his building went off at 5 a.m. Half asleep, he donned a mask and joined the building’s 12 other residents to wait outside.
“Every single person was wearing a mask. And that really solidified for me that Harvard kids are taking this seriously,” he said. “[The administration] trusted us, the kids who came back, and I don't think we're gonna let them down.”
