After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite Massachusetts reporting the highest unemployment rate in the country last month, Cambridge has seen a relatively low rate compared to the rest of the Commonwealth.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last month that Massachusetts had an unemployment rate of 17.4 percent. In Cambridge, however, the unemployment rate sat at 10 percent.
Lisa Hemmerle, the economic development director for the City of Cambridge, said this discrepancy is largely due to the types of industries that employ the city’s labor force.
“Unemployment in Cambridge is low compared to other Mass. cities and towns,” she said. “We feel that that's because Cambridge has a relatively low number of workers in the idled occupations.”
The “idled occupations” — those most heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic — include jobs in the construction, entertainment, retail, and services industries. In Cambridge, around 11 percent of workers make up the idled occupations, compared to around 22 percent of workers in the Commonwealth.
“Relatively few folks around here work in jobs that are laid off or furloughed due to the COVID-19 shutdown compared to the state as a whole, so that kind of insulates us a little bit,” Hemmerle said. “There are many more employees in occupations such as education that are idled but more likely to continue to receive their salaries.”
Economics professor Richard B. Freeman said another statistic to examine when assessing the pandemic’s impact on the Commonwealth’s labor market is the employment-population rate: the ratio of the civilian labor force employed against the total working-age population.
“Mass. has middling low but far from [the] worst employment-population rate, at least as of May,” Freeman wrote in an email. “It is around 15th in that measure, higher than in the lowest unemp[loyment rate] state of Kentucky.
Freeman also noted that Massachusetts’ relatively high rate of unemployment is largely due to the prevalence of the state’s tourism industry.
“Mass. is one of [the] top ten states in foreign tourism, which has disappeared completely,” he wrote. “And, of course, our state and Cambridge depend critically on students and their spending, which has collapsed, at least off-line.”
“The leading parts of [the] economy were largely people-driven services and the virus destroyed much of that business,” he added.
Freeman also said the Commonwealth’s slower reopening has allowed it to better control the virus than other states that opened much earlier.
“The shutdown and slow reopening meant slow recovery in May, June and probably July but got us ahead of most other states in controlling the virus — which are suffering a lot for their short term gains in May and June,” he wrote.
Freeman said he anticipates that if a vaccine becomes available, Massachusetts will return to full employment faster than most other states. He noted, however, that the entire country must recover in order for the state to reach full employment.
Hemmerle said the city is supporting small businesses through grants and paycheck protection loans to help mitigate the impact of the economic shutdown in response to the pandemic.
“$67 million in PPP loans were made to Cambridge businesses, allowing them to retain a reported 21,964 jobs (those are all jobs retained by these Cambridge businesses, though the jobs are not all in Cambridge),” Hemmerle wrote in an email.
Additionally, the city announced a Small Business Grant Program, which provides grants of up to $10,000 to assist with rent, utilities, salaries, and cost of goods, and a Cambridge Redevelopment Authority zero interest loan program, which provides loans of up to $15,000.
“The City of Cambridge and Cambridge Redevelopment Authority awarded $3.6 million dollars in grants and loans to support small businesses,” she said. “We've really focused on helping our women- and minority-owned businesses, and more than 65 percent of those recipients are women-, minority-, or women-and-minority-owned businesses.”
“We're pretty excited about that — to be able to help those small businesses make it through this really unprecedented episode in history,” Hemmerle added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Federal authorities charged former Harvard Chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber in a superseding indictment with tax offenses for failing to report income he received from Wuhan University of Technology, the Department of Justice announced Tuesday. He was previously indicted last month on charges of making false statements.
Lieber, who Harvard placed on paid administrative leave following his January arrest, now faces six felony charges. He is currently on pretrial release after paying $1 million in bail.
A federal grand jury indicted Lieber on two counts of making and subscribing a false income tax return and two counts of failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts with the IRS. In June 2020, Lieber was indicted on two counts of making false statements to federal authorities about his participation in China’s Thousand Talents Program.
The Chinese government established the Thousand Talents Program in 2008, seeking to attract scholars from across the world to contribute to Chinese development. The U.S. government has since said the program poses a danger to national security.
Representatives of Wuhan University of Technology in China allegedly asked Lieber to participate in the Thousand Talents Program. He signed a three-year contract as a One Thousand Talent “high level foreign expert” in 2012, according to charging documents.
Lieber allegedly received income from the Wuhan University of Technology in 2013 and 2014 that he failed to report on his federal tax returns, according to the indictment.
He also allegedly failed to report in 2014 and 2015 that he held a foreign bank account with a value of over $10,000, as required by federal law. Wuhan university officials helped him open a Chinese bank account in 2012, where they deposited portions of his salary, according to the indictment.
Lieber’s lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey, wrote in a statement Tuesday that the indictment is “flat-out wrong.”
“The notion that Professor Lieber was engaged in improper work with China is laughable,” Mukasey wrote. “He didn’t hide anything, and he didn’t get paid as the government alleges.”
“He is innocent and his name will be cleared,” Mukasey added.
Lieber is scheduled to appear before a judge for a virtual status conference Thursday.
University officials declined to comment Tuesday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Moderna, Inc., a Cambridge-based biotechnology company, has begun the Phase 3 clinical trial of its coronavirus vaccine candidate, the company announced Monday.
The trial will test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 disease after two doses and is expected to enroll 30,000 participants at nearly 100 research sites.
Moderna is conducting the study in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — part of the National Institutes of Health — and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
In late March, the National Institutes of Health announced it would begin Phase 1 study, and Moderna received FDA approval to proceed with Phase 2 in early May.
In a press release Monday, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel praised the work of those involved in the vaccine’s development.
“We are grateful to the efforts of so many inside and outside the company to get us to this important milestone,” Bancel said. “We look forward to this trial demonstrating the potential of our vaccine to prevent COVID-19, so that we can defeat this pandemic.”
The vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, was created using the genetic sequence of the coronavirus, which is available in a public database. Scientists at Moderna and the NIH identified the sequence for a protein on the surface of the virus, known as the spike protein, as a candidate for a vaccine, according to Moderna’s website.
The instructions for making the spike protein were then encoded into mRNA, which could be administered to patients as a vaccine. The vaccine then instructs the body’s cells to express the spike protein and elicit an immune response.
“What makes this approach different is that you don’t need to make the virus itself to make a vaccine — a time consuming and intensive process,” a video on Moderna’s website states. “Instead you use the information from the virus and administer the information directly to the patient.”
“Essentially, the patient makes their own vaccine,” the video adds.
The video credits this unique process for Moderna and NIH’s ability “to go from sequence to a vaccine ready for human testing in record time — just 42 days.”
Volunteer trial participants for the Phase 3 study will receive two injections approximately 28 days apart. Half of the participants will receive injections of the vaccine, while the other half will be given shots of a saline placebo. Investigators and participants will not know who is receiving the vaccine and who is not.
Scientists will then examine blood samples from the participants and monitor immune responses to the coronavirus. Participants will also be tested for Covid-19 periodically, and study investigators will review trial safety data regularly.
In addition to preventing symptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection, other objectives for study in the trial include testing whether the vaccine can prevent the disease without symptoms and whether just one dose is enough to prevent symptomatic Covid-19.
A press release on Moderna’s website also states the company is “on track” to be able to deliver approximately 500 million doses per year — possibly 1 billion doses per year — beginning in 2021, due to their manufacturing capabilities and collaborations with biotechnology company Lonza, Ltd. and pharmaceutical provider Catalent, Inc.
NIH Director Francis S. Collins said in a press release having a vaccine available by the end of 2020 remains their objective.
“Having a safe and effective vaccine distributed by the end of 2020 is a stretch goal, but it’s the right goal for the American people,” he said.
