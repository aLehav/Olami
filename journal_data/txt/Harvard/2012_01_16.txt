After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former governor, former U.S. representatives, and a journalist will be among the fellows at the Institute of Politics this spring.
The IOP will host seven resident fellows for the semester, it announced Thursday. The fellows will each lead a weekly study group for undergraduates and community members as well as participate in other IOP events.
Former U.S. Representatives Artur G. Davis ’90, George R. Nethercutt Jr., and Ted Strickland will share insights they gained in Congress in their study groups.
Other fellows with experience in the political fray are Steven P. Schrage, the former chief of staff for Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown, and Kathryn L. Taylor, who served as mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Two fellows have been involved in politics without running for office or working for politicians. Margaret A. McKenna, the president of the Walmart Foundation, and Farai Chideya ’90, a journalist who covers culture and politics, will add their perspectives to the mix of fellows.
“This semester, we had one of the best applicant pools in history,” IOP Director Trey Grayson said. “It was a tough decision, but basically the staff chose with student input.”
Students interviewed candidates to help choose the seven applicants who received semester-long fellowships.
As a journalist who has covered five presidential elections and has worked for print, television, and web outlets, Chideya will focus on the intersection of social media and politics in her seminar. Participants will study traditional and new methods that candidates and political institutions use to reach their audiences.
Strickland, who served as governor of Ohio in addition to his time in Congress, will lead a study group on "class warfare” which will explore topics such as childhood poverty, educational inequity, and income disparity in America.
Other fellows will lead discussions on topics ranging from American education policy to the 2012 presidential race.
Besides study groups, IOP fellows interact with students each semester by hosting office hours and attending events at Harvard.
“Fellows love being here on campus and participating in activities,” Grayson said. “I’m sure this semester they’ll go to basketball games, attend a cappella concerts, audit classes—we want them to immerse themselves on campus as best as they can.”
While they enjoy college life, the fellows also advise undergraduates. “There is a career counseling aspect to it,” Grayson said. “The mission [of the fellowship] is to bridge the political and academic world, letting students know the war story, or behind-the-scene story, of how politics works. We hope that all of them can inspire students to pursue careers in politics, government, and public policy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two key endorsements from former Democratic rivals and the announcement of impressive fourth quarter fundraising totals helped to buoy Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren’s campaign for the U.S. Senate this week.
In separate announcements, former Democratic hopefuls Robert K. Massie and Alan A. Khazei ’83 both said they would endorse Warren in her run against Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown this fall. Both candidates withdrew from the Democratic nominating race shortly after Warren announced her candidacy last October.
The endorsement of Warren by her two chief Democratic rivals signals growing unity from Massachusetts Democrats, which analysts said will be key if their party wishes to unseat Brown.
“The endorsements are more about the Democratic Party getting behind Warren than delivering votes,” said Mass. Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh in an email, adding that Democrats now recognize Warren as the only candidate among their ranks able to take on Brown.
The endorsements came as Warren’s campaign announced new fourth quarter fundraising numbers, which exceeded those of Brown for a second consecutive quarter.
Warren raised $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 alone compared with Brown’s $3.2 million for the same time period, according to disclosures from both campaigns. Yet despite raising $8.8 million since she declared her candidacy last September, Warren still trails the well-backed Republican by almost half.
Brown raised a relatively small $8.5 million for the whole of 2011, but the large cash reserve left over from his 2010 Senate run continues to give him an advantage over Warren. At the end of the fiscal year, Brown had $12.8 million cash on hand and Warren roughly $6 million.
The financial disclosures and early endorsements show that Warren’s campaign has gained momentum both in Massachusetts and nationally, according to former Boston City Councilor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71.
“There’s been great interest with people who traditionally do not participate,” DiCara said. “I think her candidacy is exciting a lot of people.”
Enthusiasm for the Harvard professor and consumer advocate has rallied support within the state, but national Democratic leaders and forces have been drawn to the race by its broader implications.
“This may be one of the very few opportunities for Democrats to flip a seat this election,” DiCara said. He explained that the same anti-establishment movement that swept Brown into office two years ago in a special election could potentially hurt him as an incumbent this time around.
“The law of politics is the law of the pendulum, and perhaps the pendulum is swinging back,” DiCara said.
Warren’s reputation as a consumer advocate and her work with the Consumer Protection Bureau may allow Warren to take back some of the decisive middle class vote Brown received in last election, DiCara and Marsh said.
“The 2012 election will be based on one thing: whom do you trust to fight for you in Washington? Scott Brown … or Elizabeth Warren who has a record of fighting for middle class families in Washington,” Marsh wrote.
The $5.7 million raised by Warren in the fourth quarter came from 23,000 residents of Massachusetts and a host of other national donors, according to her website, which identifies her fundraising efforts as a “grass-roots” campaign to take down Brown’s “war chest.”
“For a first time candidate to raise more than an incumbent United States Senator is impressive,” Marsh wrote. “What is more impressive is the number of donors and the fact that the average contribution is $64.”
“Regretfully, money is a barometer and the fact that she’s raised so much money is indicative that she is being taken seriously,” DiCara said, comparing Democratic fundraising effort today to the one made to launch Sen. John Kerry to the White House eight years ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s squash team was down to its final point—twice. But with its undefeated record and No. 1 national ranking on the line, the Crimson came back in dramatic fashion, capturing a 5-4 win over No. 4 Princeton (5-2, 1-2 Ivy) Sunday afternoon at the Barnaby Courts.
The hero of the match was not 2010 CSA Individual Champion Laura Gemmell, nor 2010 World Junior Champion Amanda Sobhy; it was freshman Haley Mendez. With the match knotted at four individual victories apiece, Mendez squared off against Princeton’s Lexi Saunders in the final and deciding matchup.
And early on, it looked like the Crimson (9-0, 3-0) was headed toward its first loss since last winter when Harvard fell to Yale at the CSA Team Championships. The rookie dropped the first two games and then fell behind, 10-9 and 11-10, in the third. But Mendez battled back to capture the 14-12 win in the third and then won decisively in the fourth and fifth games (11-3 and 11-2, respectively) to give the Crimson its ninth straight team victory.
Despite playing in just the ninth match of her collegiate career, Mendez was happy to be the one on the court with the match on the line.
“I definitely get 10 times more nervous watching everyone else play,” the rookie said. “Going into it, I just told myself that I’m playing and it matters and this is the fun part; this is why I play squash. So that kept me calm.”
Also helping to ease Mendez’s nerves was the fact that she had been in a similar position just this past summer. As a member of the U.S. squad that competed at the 2011 World Junior Championships held at Harvard this past July, Mendez won the deciding match for the Americans in their semifinal matchup with India.
“I was grateful that I had been through [a similar situation] once actually,” Mendez said.
Even so, Mendez fell behind early. She dropped a tight first game, 11-9, and then blew a 4-1 lead in the second, falling 11-13. Mendez and Saunders went back and forth in the third with the Princeton sophomore eventually grabbing match point, 10-9. Mendez answered with a drop shot to even the score, but she fell behind when Saunders was awarded a stroke.
Once again, Mendez evened the score, landing a drop shot in the left corner. After both players hit tin on the next two points, Mendez closed out the game, hitting back-to-back winners to take the game, 14-12.
With momentum on her side, Mendez jumped out to a 3-1 lead in the fourth and never looked back, taking the game, 11-3.
The deciding game was all Mendez. After dropping the first point, she took the next eight, eventually winning, 11-2.
During the ensuing celebration, Mendez was told by one of her teammates that she had nearly “given her a heart attack.”
“[Watching Mendez’s match] was really nerve-racking; I was pretty much biting my nails the whole time,” said Sobhy, one of Mendez’s teammates at the 2011 World Junior Championships. “I believed in her. She was on my team over the summer and she was the clinching match for us in the team event, so I knew that she could come back and do it.”
Sobhy turned in a remarkable performance of her own on Sunday, but in a very different sense. Rather than coming back in dramatic fashion, Sobhy, playing at the No. 1 spot, made quick work of Princeton’s two-time All American Julie Cerullo, winning, 3-0 (11-6, 11-3, 11-4). In fact, the highly touted rookie won the first games so convincingly that much of the crowd that had gathered around the glass court to watch the matchup had left to watch other games.
“She’s a good player, so it was a good match and I worked hard,” said Sobhy, who was playing in just her second match with the Crimson after missing the first seven due to eligibility concerns. “I’m just happy I played well and pretty much dominated. I was in control, so I was happy about it.”
In addition to the wins from Sobhy at the No.1 spot and Mendez at the No. 4 spot, the Crimson also received victories from No. 2 Gemmell, No. 5 Natasha Kingshott, and No. 7 Sarah Mumanachit.
Gemmell, playing at the No. 2 spot for just the second time in her career, picked up Harvard’s first win, besting Katherine Giovinazzo, 3-0 (11-4, 11-5, 11-3). Kingshott and Mumanachit followed with 3-1 wins to even the match at 4-4, setting up the dramatic finale between Mendez and Saunders.
“That was an unbelievable match,” Crimson coach Mike Way said. “For those individuals that really got the job done, it just feels so good mentally. The struggle is always between the ears.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The saying is that everything is bigger and better in Texas, but that did not prove to be the case for the Harvard wrestling team on Saturday.
Despite opening its dual season with a 3-1 record, Harvard (4-3, 1-1 EIWA) went 1-2 at Saturday’s Lone Star Duals, sandwiching its 27-12 win against Air Force between its two losses to Appalachian State and No. 12 Oklahoma, 22-21 and 28-9, respectively.
No. 5 junior co-captain Walter Peppelman and freshman Josh Popple were the only two Crimson wrestlers to post perfect 3-0 records at the event, held at South Grand Prairie High School in Grand Prairie, Texas. Peppelman’s three victories included two falls, bringing his season total to eight and his career total to 24.
No. 12 co-captain Corey Jantzen, who returned to action last weekend after sitting out the past year due to injury, secured a 2-1 record for the day, including an upset over No. 7 Nick Lester with a 7-6 decision.
OKLAHOMA 28, HARVARD 9
Harvard fell behind in the dual early on and Oklahoma’s (8-2, 2-1 Big 12) seven victories never gave the Crimson a chance to get back into it. The Sooners lineup included six wrestlers in the top 20 of their respective weight classes compared to just three for Harvard. Peppelman, Popple, and Janzten were the only winners for the squad, each winning their matchups by decision.
“Oklahoma’s a very tough team,” junior Steven Keith said. “It’s just a different beast, as an Ivy League team competing against a Big 12 team, and I think we did well, so I was pretty pleased with the way we finished off.”
Jantzen pulled off the biggest upset of the dual with his 7-6 win over No. 7 Nick Lester. The lead seesawed back and forth, but Jantzen ultimately prevailed. The win brought Jantzen’s career record to 46-18.
Jantzen started off the bout with an early takedown just 50 seconds into the match, but Lester quickly evened the match by earning two points of his own. Lester gained his first lead, 5-4, in the second period, but Jantzen pulled out ahead once again with a takedown to go ahead, 6-5. Despite Lester tying the bout with his third escape, Jantzen won when he received an extra point for riding time to earn Harvard its first three points of the dual.
Peppelman brought the Crimson another three points with his 2-0 victory over No. 14 Matt Lester. Peppelman got out to an early lead with two points for a takedown in the first period, and the match remained scoreless in the following two periods.
Popple gave Harvard its final three points of the dual with a win over Marcus Armato. Armato started with an early 2-0 lead, but Popple turned things around and dominated the rest of the match, going on a 10-1 run to win by decision.
HARVARD 27, AIR FORCE 12
The Crimson’s only victory of the day came against Air Force (3-3, 0-1 WWC), with seven Harvard wrestlers winning their bouts. Last season, the Crimson also defeated the Falcons for one of its only two dual wins all season.
Jantzen lost for the first time this season against Cole VonOhlen, who defeated Janzten at 149 pounds in an 11-5 decision. The victory earned Air Force three points and gave the squad the lead for the first time since the opening bout at 125 lbs.
Peppelman picked up his second fall of the season, with a pin just 29 seconds into the match against Joshua Kreimier. Peppelman earned six points for the fall and sparked a five-match Crimson winning streak.
Sophomores Cameron Croy and Ian Roy and freshman Patrick Hogan also topped their Falcon counterparts. Croy and Roy each won their matches by decision, 11-8 and 5-4, respectively. Hogan won in a 6-4 decision, picking up an extra point for riding time.
APPALACHIAN STATE 22, HARVARD 21
Harvard held the lead three times during the matchup and grabbed a two-point advantage going into the heavyweight bout, but Applachian State (8-3, 2-0 Southern) won the final bout when it mattered most, with Joe Cummings earning a 7-3 decision over freshman David Ng for three points.
“I think we started off a little slow against Applachian State,” Keith said. “I think that’s a team we can beat. Everyone could have done a little bit more. Obviously, you can’t point to one person because it’s a team effort.”
Popple won his matchup at 174 lbs. by technical fall against Carter Downs. The freshman dominated the match and shut out his opponent 15-0 to gain five points for the Crimson.
Keith defeated Brett Boston at 133 lbs. in a 9-5 decision, and freshman James Fox produced Harvard’s last victory of the dual with a 9-1 major decision against Paul Weiss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, after losing to Fordham, the then-No. 21/22 Harvard men’s basketball team plummeted out of the AP Top 25 and fell four spots to No. 25 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.
This week went a bit better for the Crimson, which gained ground in both of the two major polls, released Monday afternoon. Fueled by wins over Monmouth and George Washington, Harvard moved to No. 24 in the coaches poll and picked up six more points in the AP.
With the Crimson’s at-large hopes largely shot thanks to the Jan. 3 loss to the Rams, Harvard will likely have to take the Ivy League title to make the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 66 years. 1-0 in league play so far thanks to a 63-47 win against Dartmouth at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard has only conference games left on its slate.
After traveling to Dartmouth on Jan. 21, the Crimson will have what most consider its toughest remaining test of the year six days later, visiting a strong Yale team at the John J. Lee Amphitheatre.
The Crimson’s last two trips to New Haven have been painful. On Feb. 26, Harvard missed a potential game-winning shot at the buzzer, falling to Yale, 70-69. The loss helped set up a one-game playoff for a trip to the Big Dance between the Crimson and Princeton on Mar. 12, again at the John J. Lee Amphitheatre.
In case you forgot, the Tigers won that won on a buzzer-beater, 63-62.
