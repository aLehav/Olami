After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suffering a surprising defeat to Brown on Friday night, Harvard men's basketball(13-9, 6-3 Ivy) will challenge Yale in a critical conference game in Payne-Whitney Gym in New Haven. Junior wing Justin Bassey, who played just 15 minutes against the Bears fighting a low right leg injury, will be out tonight.
The Bulldogs are coming in with just one defeat in conference play, which it suffered at the hands of the Crimson on Feb 1. Harvard cruised to a 65-49 victory in the friendly confines of Lavietes Pavilion, but tonight's sold-out crowd at Yale will be quite a different environment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bryce Aiken did it again.
In front of 45 friends and family inside a thunderous, sold-out John J. Lee Amphitheater, Aiken went coast-to-coast and flushed a step-back jumper over Yale’s Trey Phills as the horn sounded.
The junior point guard was swarmed instantaneously by the Crimson bench, stunning the crowd at New Haven that had seen its team’s six-point lead in the final two minutes vanish. A critical open-lane dunk and corner triple in the final minute by freshman Kale Catchings — who earned a career-high 16 points in his first ever start — upended a Bulldogs lead the hosts had held since the 10-minute mark. 
“We needed everyone to have a victory like this tonight because of how good Yale is and how athletic they are,” Amaker said. “I can't say enough about our team and what we were able to accomplish — making decisions in critical moments and certainly making plays and shots to get the win. So proud of our kids for the effort that they brought after last night[’s loss to Brown].”
Yale guard Alex Copeland capped off an efficient 21-point outing with a deep triple in the waning 10 seconds of the contest to even the contest at 86-86, but 7.8 seconds still remained on the clock. Bryce Aiken used every single remaining second to pull off another magical clincher.
“I saw there was 7.8 seconds on the clock, so that was more than enough time for us to get a shot up,” Aiken said. “My teammates trust me, my coach trusts me, the whole program does…What my team trusts me to do is make that last play and luckily it went in.”
This was the third of the past six games in which Aiken’s final-second heroics salvaged a Crimson victory. The Randolph, NJ., native drilled a double-clutch heave against Columbia to force double-overtime, followed by a desperation three that found the bottom of the net in Harvard’s 75-68 overtime victory at the Palestra.
With the victory, the Crimson tallied its seventh Ancient Eight win and swept the league-leading Bulldogs, whose only two conference losses have come at the hands of Coach Tommy Amaker’s side. Similar to past contests, this game was a back-and-forth outing: the contest had a total of 17 lead changes.
“They got some great energy from the kid [Kale] Catchings coming off the bench, playing really hard.” Yale coach James Jones said. “He made a couple of great plays in the game and and he certainly was a difference. Sometimes that works where you light a fire under guy and he just comes out and just plays as hard as he can.”
Amaker, with program cornerstone Justin Bassey in sweatpants after suffering a lower leg injury Friday night against Brown, made a bold shift to his opening lineup. Juniors Chris Lewis and Robert Baker remained on the pine at tip-off. In their stead, two freshmen —Catchings and Mason Forbes — were called pregame by the PA announcer for the first time in their careers. While Catchings had seen limited action in Ivy play, Forbes had tallied just three minutes of game action since Jan 21.
While Forbes and classmate Noah Kirkwood had quiet nights on the offensive end, the two contributed in crucial fashion on the opposite end. Forbes altered several shots from a rim-hungry Yale squad, while Kirkwood was tasked with covering the Bulldogs’ best player, junior wing Miye Oni. Importantly, Kirkwood drew a charge on the Bulldogs’ 21-point man at the 11-minute mark that sent Oni to the bench with four fouls. The Yale sharpshooter’s troubles avoiding the referee’s whistle in the second half was a game-shifter for the Bulldogs as Oni saw the floor for only eight minutes in that frame.
“Kale and Mason were the two that we inserted in the lineup, for energy, for defense, for their toughness, their grit,” Amaker said. “I thought they both played exceptionally well tonight. I had no hesitation about making that kind of decision in this kind of game, in this kind of environment and they certainly proved me to be correct.”
Without its best player on the court at the halfway point of the half, Yale was not deterred and instead sprinted out to its own 9-4 run to pull away to a 77-70 lead at the 6:16 mark. In response, Amaker re-inserted Lewis — who had sat out the majority of the second frame. The Alpharetta, Ga., native provided two aggressive rim finishes, which compounded by a Danilo Djuricic fast-break dunk and a Christian Juzang triple in the 6 minute-to-4 minute span suddenly brought the contest back to a one-possession margin at 79-77.
Almost re-handing the game back to the home side, the Crimson followed that series with two giveaways — the first which ended in a Miye Oni fast-break jam — but the aforementioned Catchings and Aiken once again willed Harvard back from that six-point deficit. Catchings had himself a breakout game, fighting for three steals and bulldozing his way into the paint for a pair of two-handed slams as well as two up-and-under lay-ins.
“I stay ready whenever I can,” Catchings said. “ And I have great mentors and upperclassmen. I get to room with Justin Bassey every weekend whenever we go on these road trips. Just being able to see him and how he goes about every day in practice, what his routine looks like, and seeing how he works, I realized I can go out there and try to replicate the best I can give.”
The Bulldogs, who entered Saturday’s outing seventh in the NCAA in field goal percentage(49.8), jumped out to a lightning-hot start in front of a boisterous crowd at the John J. Lee Amphitheater. Off four triples from sharpshooter Miye Oni, Yale exploded to a perfect 10-for-10 start. On the opposite end, the visitors languished out of the locker room for the second straight night, converting on two buckets in the opening four minutes.
By the 14:30 mark, the Bulldogs had widened its margin to 24-10 and the game appeared to be at risk of getting away from Harvard. But a fast-break layup from Bryce Aiken followed by an invigorating open-lane dunk from Catchings tempered the Yale run. Sophomore Danilo Djuricic, who did not enter the contest until the 10:45 point, provided a much-needed lift off the bench — immediately finding net on two triples. The Canadian also added a mid-range jumper at the five-minute mark to will the team back to a one-point deficit, before a Kirkwood three helped the Crimson eclipse the Bulldogs for the first time in the contest two minutes later. A Forbes tip-in concluded Harvard’s offense output in the first half, as it trailed by just one entering the locker-room.
The second half started off with both sides exchanging points and this would prove to be a sign of things to come in the final minutes. Yale quickly tallied a flurry of fouls in a scrappy second half. Outside of a Catchings layup four minutes into the half, Harvard scored only off free throws — 8 to be specific — in the first five minutes. Aiken’s 13-of-15 night from the charity stripe combined with a 22-of-27 outing from the line was a critical factor in keeping the Crimson within striking distance.
On the night as a whole, Aiken was just two points shy of another 30-point outing, while the Crimson shot 28-of-55 from the field. Harvard out-rebounded Yale by six boards, despite playing small ball for most of the contest. Six players on the visiting side converted a triple in a 45 percent night from the arc.
“I think we were really fortunate tonight to beat the best team in our league on their home floor,” Amaker said. “ …So we just think they have a lot of right pieces of the puzzle they play well with. James [Jones] has done a tremendous job and terrific effort that they put forth tonight, and we were fortunate to get the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two seconds left in the first half, Madeline Raster drove to the basket, drew a foul, and hit a tough layup to the delight of an exuberant Lavietes Pavilion crowd. She added the free throw to put Harvard up 52-27 at the half. It was a fitting end to a dominant first half for the Crimson, which went on to beat Yale 83-69, avenging the heartbreaking loss Harvard suffered in New Haven three weeks ago.
For Raster, the game was notable beyond just being the perfect end to a terrific weekend for the Crimson (14-9, 7-3 Ivy). She led Harvard with 24 points, the ninth of which was her 1,000th in a Crimson uniform. About a month after junior guard Katie Benzan became the 21st Harvard player to reach the 1,000 point milestone, Raster became No. 22.
“I’m really honored [to reach 1,000 points],” Raster said. “I’ve played with a lot of great teammates here and obviously I have a coach like Kathy [Delaney-Smith] who has believed in me from freshman year and has let me play and grow as a player, so I’m just really honored.”
For the second straight night, Harvard blitzed its opponent from the opening tip, ensuring that there would be no repeat of the buzzer-beater that made the Bulldogs (15-10, 5-5) victorious the first time around. The Crimson ended the first quarter up 24-14 and then scored the first 12 points of the second quarter — including three straight threes to start the quarter — to take a 24 point lead before Yale could gain a foothold in the game.
“I think we came out really strong in this game,” Raster said. “We moved the ball really well like we did against Brown last night and got everyone touches and baskets. That really helped us get a lot of momentum in the first half.”
The three triples in the span of about one second quarter minute were part of an efficient first half performance from long range. Harvard’s six first half threes were a welcome change from the first game against the Bulldogs, when the Crimson hit just five shots from beyond the arc on 23 attempts.
As has become the norm of late, Harvard emphasized getting the ball down low early on, with junior forward Jeannie Boehm and sophomore forward Jadyn Bush leading the team with six first quarter points apiece. Boehm and Bush both eventually fouled out, but not before they poured in a combined 24 points, 15 rebounds, two steals, and three blocks.
While the Crimson’s four top scorers — Raster, Benzan (who poured in 18 points), Boehm, and Bush — ended up leading the team in scoring once again, Harvard’s best stretch of the game was actually spurred by big shots from junior guard Mackenzie Barta and sophomore forward Rachel Levy. Levy ended the game with nine points on 3-of-4 shooting, as she played 22 minutes largely in relief of the foul-ridden Bush.
“They’re both really really good shooters,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “For them to step up offensively was great. We were really happy with that contribution for sure.”
The Crimson came out in the second half noticeably less sharp, as they had multiple long stretches in which they struggled to manufacture good looks on the offensive end and forced some contested shots. The Bulldogs outscored Harvard 42-31 overall in the second half, although the inroads Yale made largely came well after the game had been decided.
Even in the second half, the Crimson played solid defense, limiting Yale to 36% shooting. The emphasis for Harvard was shutting down impressive freshman forward Camilla Emsbo, who led the Bulldogs with 15 points and seven rebounds in the first meeting between the teams.
The Crimson chose to double-team Emsbo when she received the ball in the post, a strategy that clearly paid off. She ended up shooting just 1-of-8 for two points, the worst performance of her young Yale career. The Bulldogs were outscored by 23 points in her 19 minutes on the court, giving her the worst plus-minus of any Yale player.
“I think [Emsbo] is 6’5” and she had been scoring a lot,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think teams have decided to do things differently to take her out of her game. We had decided to double-down on her. She’s not a great passer yet so I thought that disrupted her a little bit. Now that the heat is on her, I think it’s sort of a welcome to Division I basketball. I think all big players go through that. It’s a hard transition for inside players.”
Junior Roxy Barahman led the way for the Bulldogs, notwithstanding a scary fall midway through the third quarter that turned out to be less serious than was initially feared. Barahman scored 21 points, two above her season average, but she had to work for those points, hoisting up 21 shots as she was guarded closely by Benzan throughout.
“Katie Benzan did a great job on [Barahman],” Delaney-Smith said. “The unfortunate thing is I did not rest Katie very well tonight. For most of the game Katie did a great job, but I think Katie got dog-tired at the end is what I think happened to her.”
It was the second straight blowout win for Harvard, which secured its first weekend sweep of the season and kept pace with Penn (8-1) and Princeton (7-2) in the battle for seeding in the Ivy League tournament, which will take place in three weeks in New Haven. The Crimson will travel to Philadelphia and then Princeton next weekend and will be looking to prove that this year there are three teams seriously contending for the Ivy League championship.

The last time the Harvard men’s hockey team met Yale, in New Haven, Conn., the game ended in a stalemate. Before that, the Crimson hadn’t beaten the Bulldogs in the regular season since Feb. 17, 2017. Add to that the fact that Saturday’s matchup — the game that would decide the season series — was also Harvard’s Senior Night, and you have a contest that’s bound to be a back-and-forth treat.
But the No. 17/15 Crimson (16-8-3, 12-6-2 ECAC) wound up getting the better of the Bulldogs (13-11-3, 11-8-1) early in the first and never looked back. The star of the show was junior net-minder Cameron Gornet, who backstopped the team this weekend in place of injured senior Michael Lackey. Not only did Gornet lead his squad to a 3-0 shutout, he also was awarded the Tim Taylor Cup, given to the most valuable player in a Harvard-Yale contest at Bright-Landry.
"When you come to Harvard, the big rivalry you always talk about is Harvard-Yale," Gornet said. "It's really exciting coming in and sort of sticking it to 'em."
The Bulldogs came out for the first with energy, drawing a penalty less than six minutes into the frame. But the Crimson withstood the early pressure; at the 8:50 mark, the hosts were the ones to break the ice. An offensive-zone faceoff win — courtesy of sophomore Jack Badini, third-best on the draw in the country (65.3%) — saw Badini carry the puck behind the net and pass to rookie defenseman Jack Rathbone. Rathbone made no mistake, picking a corner to beat senior goaltender Sam Tucker and give his team a 1-0 lead.
Rathbone’s snipe is his second in 2019 (5–11—16), wrapping up a two-point weekend. The freshman finished the night with 6 shots to his stat line, pacing Harvard on a night with considerable shot volume (46 SOG).
"We have two [defensemen] that are horses out there in Fox and Marino," said head coach Ted Donato '91. "We have their two understudies in Rathbone and Walsh."
A flurry of penalties closed out the first period, with Yale freshman Justin Pearson taking a seat to cancel out a power play chance for his team. Having the better part of the man advantage to start the second, the Crimson sent out its top unit.
Sophomore blue-liner Reilly Walsh, the team’s leading power play goal-scorer, carried into the high slot only to hit the post with his shot. Junior defenseman Adam Fox was there to scoop up the rebound and dish it to co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage, who walked in on Tucker and fired it top-side.
The power play tally was Harvard’s second of the weekend after a recent dry spell, giving Zerter-Gossage his team-leading 16th goal of the season. The senior has netted six goals in his last eight games; though the season is far from finished, Zerter-Gossage has already set a career best for goal-scoring.
"I don't think we were great in the first period on the power play," coach Donato said. "When you have a successful power play...you've got to keep evolving as teams throw different coverages at you.... Tonight we scored a couple of goals, but we generated a lot of chances."
The middle frame featured no more scoring, with the Crimson holding a small edge in shots through the game thus far (24-21). Harvard very nearly found itself ahead by three goals — by a fraction of a second, in fact. Junior defender John Marino put the puck in the net just as the buzzer sounded, and after review the play was ruled no goal.
With just 20 minutes on the clock, Gornet saw another barrage of Bulldog attempts thrown his way, but the junior weathered the storm. The Crimson’s penalty kill is ranked a modest 47th of 60 NCAA teams (77.5%); however, the team did away with another Yale power play chance in the middle of the final frame, en route to a perfect 6-for-6 performance.
Once again, the PK received a helping hand as Bulldogs sophomore forward Dante Palecco was sent to the box for hooking. Harvard was on the man advantage not long after Palecco’s offense. The point-men combined in a play that has become a routine sight for Crimson fans, as Fox, avoiding a Yale player, backhanded the puck to a waiting Walsh. The sophomore’s one-timer zipped past Tucker, extending the hosts’ lead to 3-0.
A no-goal call once a game calls for a shrug and a quick recovery, but two is a surprise. Less than a minute later, Harvard fell prey to another video review, as an apparent tally for sophomore Jack Donato was waved off as a kick.
"You try to not let that affect how you play," Zerter-Gossage said. "Coaches always say, no matter what the result is, get back to the game plan. It's definitely tough, because you've got those thoughts, 'We could be up by one more goal,' but I think we handled it well and kept playing our game."
The final whistle gave Gornet (5 GP, 2.64 GAA, .920 SV%) his first career shutout, sealing a solid weekend for the junior (.969 SV%). Should Lackey remain sidelined for the close of the regular season next week, Gornet has proven that he is an able replacement.
Several of Harvard’s key offensive contributors are also riding hot streaks. Walsh is running a seven-game point streak (3–7—10). Meanwhile, Fox earned his third three-point effort of the season, giving him 11 points (1–10—11) in his last six contests. The junior paces all players in assists per game (1.11), and also leads all defensemen in assists (30) and points per game (1.41). He and Walsh are first and second in team scoring respectively; the program hasn’t had two defensemen pace the team at the end of the season in the past 11 years.
"It's definitely a luxury to have the talent that we have as our final line of defense," said Zerter-Gossage on the defense corps as a whole. "When you can throw it back and trust that a play is going to be made...it's something that you kind of take for granted as the season goes along. All the points that they're racking up [are] definitely well-deserved, and I don't think it's going to go unnoticed how much they mean to our team offensively and defensively."
The Crimson’s 2019 class also closed the book on the season at home on Saturday; aside from Lackey, the entire senior class dressed for the game. The emotion of Senior Night seems to fire up the team especially, as Harvard has triumphed on the last five occasions. Its seniors have been part of two NCAA Tournament runs, including a 2017 Frozen Four appearance, and won the ECAC Tournament and regular season in 2017 too. Zerter-Gossage leads his class in both career games played (121) and points (39–42—81) as of now.
"Every year when it's Senior Night you don't really think of how soon yours is coming," Zerter-Gossage said. "It's gone by really fast. The way that we handled the game, especially, played a full 60 and played the style that we really want to play going forward...was a really good way to send us off."
The Crimson’s second-place ECAC tie puts the team in a good position heading into its final weekend of play. Its last two contests are against RPI and No. 20 Union; wins against either team would complete a season sweep. More importantly Harvard is still in the running to win the conference outright, as leader Cornell sits only a point ahead and will face second-place Clarkson next week. With the top four ECAC teams neck and neck, anything can happen as the regular season comes to its end.

To my dearest PSET Buddy,
This morning as I was doing cartwheels over my last PSET grade, something occurred to me. Getting up from my tumble, I thought back to that Tuesday night when I actually did the work and one face swam up from the midst of all the numbers imprinted on my eyelids.
I never could have done it without you (or I could have, after much mental anguish and 10 days after the deadline)! You’re always the one who bails me out the night before the PSET is due, when a week of bad decisions has culminated in what’s sure to be a terrible evening for me. It’s just a little further, you tell me with a smile, and I can’t help but shake my head into focus and talk through the problem with you. And suddenly, it’s not just the homework questions — it’s all the questions which have bothered me all week. Am I screwing up my life? Does the TF dislike me? Am I doomed to this vicious circle of procrastination and self-hate?
You are everything that is whole and good about the world. You violate every rule I lived by in high school — trust no one, watch your own back, feign affection for and interest in others. I’m sure other people must have exploited your brains, but I’m happy that you kept alive your optimism and concern for all those around you. The best thing about the nights (and mornings) we spend together is the faith you have in me. You look into my eyes and you believe that somewhere deep down, I know the answer or am capable of finding it. You give me confidence in myself.
Do not be surprised if you find care packages and hear an excited voice calling your name, because besides showering you with hugs you didn’t ask for and gifts you do not need for the rest of the semester, how else can I ever repay you? In the meanwhile, I guess I will try to emulate your philosophy any time I see a desperate soul in need at 2 a.m. on a Sunday night, and dream of the night when we get to hang out not hunched over a set of stapled pages in Cabot Library.
Yours truly,
A Rescued Soul
