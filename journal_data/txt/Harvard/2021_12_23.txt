10. ‘Feel Good’ (Season Two)
“Feel Good” is a show with a singular energy — equal parts hilarious and gut-wrenching, just like its writer, lead actor, and real-life inspiration Mae Martin. Season Two takes the original’s explorations of trauma, addiction, and codependency to new heights, producing one of television’s most riveting, authentic stories about healing from childhood sexual abuse and attempting to save a once-codependent relationship. “Feel Good” shines brightest when it explores the grey space between our assumed binaries, providing groundbreaking representation through its nonbinary lead and unraveling, too, our binaries of innocence and guilt, good victims and bad victims, salvageable relationships and unsalvegable ones. —Joy C. Ashford
9. ‘Insecure’ (Season Five)
For the fifth and final season of creator and star Issa Rae’s widely beloved HBO half-hour, the “Insecure” writers’ room could have packed up and taken a victory lap. Instead, the groundbreaking show, originally adapted from Rae’s web series “Awkward Black Girl,” continues to put out some of the funniest and most insightful meditations on race, careers, and relationships to ever grace our televisions. The beating heart of “Insecure” has always been the joys and complexities of the friend/soul-mate-ship between protagonist Issa Dee (Rae) and her ride-or-die Molly Carter (Yvonne Orji), and this season is no exception. With only one episode remaining, the show still has a number of loose ends (read: exes) to tie up after a heavy dose of time jumps and shenanigans. But whether or not “Insecure” sticks the landing, its legacy is secure. —Amelia Roth-Dishy
8. ‘Arcane’ (Season One)
In what can only be described as one of this year’s best combo moves, the world’s largest esport gave rise to Netflix’s best-rated original series when the streaming service teamed up with developer Riot Games to release “Arcane,” a beautifully animated expansion of the “League of Legends” universe. The excellent first season transports viewers to two fantasy sister cities as the growing divide between them threatens disaster. With Netflix and Riot’s recent announcement of the show’s renewal, time will soon tell what Season Two brings into play. —Clara V. Nguyen
We reviewed the first three-episode act of “Arcane” and loved its unique visual and narrative styles. Read more here.
7. ‘Succession’ (Season Three)
For the past three years, “Succession” has been the show on television that’s just that good. Beyond its sleek corporatism and brutal family parleys, Jesse Armstrong’s masterwork captivates with its bleak, artful examination of a billionaire clan fundamentally incapable of happiness. The show’s first two seasons were defined by infighting and shifting allegiances that built strategically to middle son Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong)’s public denouncement of his father Logan (Brian Cox) in the Season Two finale. Leading up to the show’s third installment, fans were apprehensive about what could top that dramatic climax — and their anxieties weren’t entirely unwarranted. Though the third season of “Succession” relies on a more covert species of anxiety, Armstrong sustains a strong run through moments of disquieting vulnerability and a surprise subversion in the final episode. Despite the marked change of pace, some things don’t change: Logan Roy is king, and he doesn’t plan on abdicating the throne anytime soon. —Isabella B. Cho
6. ‘The White Lotus’ (Season One) 
Shot on-location in a strict Covid-19 bubble, “The White Lotus” rode into contention for the buzziest show of the summer on its HBO-dramedy pedigree and an addictively good set of performances from a stellar ensemble cast. Created, written, and directed by Mike White, the six-episode season tracks an ultimately fatal week in the intertwined lives of guests and staff at the fictional White Lotus Resort in Hawaii. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel; the fireworks come from sharp writing, finely drawn characters, and the foreboding juxtaposition of a lush setting with the inescapable thrum of human ugliness. As the pandemic heightened a collective pillorying of the few who could afford luxury vacations in sequestered locales while the world burned, the show skewered its wealthy travelers with subtlety and verve, tapping into questions about class, white ignorance, and physical and emotional labor that could not have been more timely. —Amelia Roth-Dishy
We examined the all-too-familiar delusions of the white, wealthy Mossbacher family in a thinkpiece on “The White Lotus.” Read it here.
5. ‘The Underground Railroad’ (Season One)
Based on Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, Amazon Prime’s “The Underground Railroad” follows the journey of two enslaved people, Cora (Thuso Mbedu) and Caesar (Aaron Pierre), as they plot their escapes. Another masterpiece from the vision of “Moonlight” director Barry Jenkins, “The Underground Railroad” uses chilling sound elements and poignant filmography to capture both the horrors of enslavement and the sticking power of unspeakable trauma. With the assistance of an on-set therapist to provide a safe space for the primarily Black cast, “The Underground Railroad” successfully portrays the brutalism of this abuse without becoming simply another source of generational Black trauma. —Anya L. Henry
4. ‘Bo Burnham: Inside’ 
Filmed without a crew and entirely within director, writer, cinematographer, editor, and actor Bo Burnham’s home, “Inside” is a rare example of media produced during the pandemic that’s explicitly about the pandemic itself. Released in May on Netflix, “Inside” is Burnham’s first special since his 2016 “Make Happy” and a testament to the comedian’s resilience and creativity. Through an innovative blend of stand-up, sketch comedy, and original music, Burnham explores the isolation now familiar to us all and its pervasive effects, touching upon such topics as the challenges of digital communication, performative activism on social media, and mental health in the age of Covid-19. Unparalleled in both its message and delivery, “Inside” offers a uniquely comedic yet genuine perspective on life in the past two years with a timeliness we’re unlikely to see again. —Charles W. McCormick
3. ‘Sex Education’ (Season Three)
Netflix’s “Sex Education” is the only show that can get away with a combination of deeply emotional content and absurd comedy in the form of students dressed up as reproductive organs or a naked man using a goat to cover his genitalia. The show’s third season brilliantly dismantles the rhetoric of shame that surrounds sexuality and highlights the beauty that lies in effortless diversity. Every cast member delivers a touching and authentic performance that shatters stereotypes, yielding some of the most realistic portrayals of the high school experience to date. In this season, the show’s beloved characters and a few new faces confront an unbelievably strict administration at Moordale. Audiences are in for a rollercoaster of emotions that culminates with a reminder of the power of self-expression and self-love. With just eight one-hour episodes, Season Three of “Sex Education” is perfectly bingeable, worth watching and rewatching many times over. —Nina M. Foster
We reviewed Season Three of “Sex Education” and deemed it a beautiful exploration of character. Read more here.
2. ‘WandaVision’ 
The first television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe produced by Marvel Studios, “WandaVision” marks a turning point in the MCU’s Phase Four; the series was also the studio’s first overall release since 2019 and the Covid-19 pandemic. Created by Jac Schaeffer for Disney+, “WandaVision” sees Avengers Wanda Maximoff and Vision living a blissfully quiet life in suburbia after the events of “Avengers: Endgame” (2019) — but we soon learn that everything is not as it seems in idyllic Westview, New Jersey. Equal parts a love letter to television and a pivotal chapter in the MCU’s grand, overarching narrative, “WandaVision” blends comedy, drama, and action into a clever and deeply poignant narrative that unfolds over nine episodes. “WandaVision” emulates the tropes and aesthetics of sitcoms past to a stunningly creative end — and explores themes like grief and nostalgia with care and affecting insight. The product is a truly unique miniseries that expands the physical and narrative bounds of the MCU and offers its richest character study to date. Indeed, Marvel Studios’ first foray into television remains among its very best. —Jamila R. O’Hara
We reviewed the premiere and finale of 'WandaVision.' Read more here and here.
1. ‘Squid Game’ 
Like most sensational shows, South Korean director Hwang Dong-hyuk’s “Squid Game” brandishes the classic triumvirate of wealth, death, and sex. Marked by an aesthetic of excess, the show is strongest when it manages to walk the line between solemnity and nearly comedic extremism. Are certain allegorical moments heavy-handed? Absolutely. Were the porcine patrons a necessary add? Probably not. Despite its occasional fumbles, Hwang’s winning vision results in an elaborate and macabre joke — his punchline is that the show’s perverse world is an uncanny analog of our own. “Squid Game” extends a politics of despair that looks a good deal like Covid-19’s morbid tango with global capitalism. With an international impact amplified by memefication and social media, the hit series became that rare television show that manages to transcend the realm of entertainment to become a global event. “Squid Game”’s commitment to exploring how ordinary people rationalize acts of violence is both timely and timeless. —Isabella B. Cho
We reviewed “Squid Game” and commended its use of the grotesque to question the economic and political status quo. Read more here.

10. ‘Vince Staples’ (Vince Staples)
Vince Staples delivered a refreshing dose of brevity and precision in a year in rap music otherwise defined by excess. While Kanye West’s “Donda” and Drake’s “Certified Lover Boy” leaned on a wide variety of genres and features with mixed results, sacrificing cohesion for all-encompassing, chart-dominating magnitude, Staples’ self-titled album puts the artist’s vision and lyrical abilities front and center. Clocking in at just over 20 minutes in runtime, the Long Beach native’s latest project manages to showcase his greatest strengths — and even reveal some new ones — in a concise and focused package. Staples’ chemistry with producer Kenny Beats shines throughout the album, as the pair bounces seamlessly from a rare foray into the melodic on “ARE YOU WITH THAT?” to bleak bars about summertime violence on “TAKING TRIPS.” “Vince Staples” exudes confidence and command at every turn, constituting another success in its young creator’s already impressive discography. —Connor S. Dowd
9. ‘Happier Than Ever’ (Billie Eilish) 
Eilish’s sophomore effort takes fans of the L.A. Native and 10-time Grammy Award winner through an impressive tour of her and her brother Finneas’s musical prowess. With heartrending ballads like “Halley’s Comet” and “my future” on one end and upbeat electropop bangers like “NDA” and “OverHeated” on the other, the album has something for everyone, and yet remains unapologetically Billie. Her lush, ethereal vocals, layered over Finneas’s intoxicatingly complex production, bring the album’s percing lyrics to rich life. It is the album’s titular track, though, that really pushes “Happier Than Ever” above the fold. Over the course of a mere four minutes and 58 seconds, Eilish takes listeners through a haunting rollercoaster of genres and emotions, from a soft-spoken and melodic introduction to the rock-inspired second half of the song through which guitar solos blaze. From beginning to end, the album is a stunning feat. —Sofia Andrade
8. ‘Juno’ (Remi Wolf)
Bedroom pop favorite Remi Wolf — frequently featured on Spotify playlists like “Lorem” or “Ultimate Indie” — released her debut album “Juno” in October of this year, an album that delivered on the bright, electric energy fans have come to expect from her. Produced in close collaboration with bandmate Jared “Solomonophonic” Solomon, the album is full of high energy guitar and surreal lyric narratives — some of which simply make no sense at all, like the line “I got violets on my violence.” Despite its upbeat quality, the album is handling heavy emotions and processing a difficult time in Wolf’s life. As expressed by the very first song on the album — “Liquor Store” — much of the work is about becoming sober, a process Wolf started in 2020, during the pandemic. Her work is mature and stylistically incredibly unique, but also just plain fun, and this first album is nothing if not the indication of a talented career ahead. —Sara Komatsu
7. ‘Heaux Tales’ (Jazmine Sullivan) 
In January, R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan released new music for the first time in nearly six years when she dropped “Heaux Tales,” the fourth album of her career. Though it may be only 32 minutes long, “Heaux Tales” punches well above its weight. As its title might suggest, the album explores and gives voice to women’s perspectives on love and sex, emphasizing their nuance and complexity. It features six interludes on the topic, all inspired by real conversations, which divide time between eight acoustically simple yet powerful songs that speak to Sullivan’s prowess as both a singer and producer. The result is a meaning-rich sonic treat, begging to be listened to again and again. — Daniel S. de Castro
 6. ‘30’ (Adele)
On Nov. 19, Adele released her fourth studio album “30” after a six-year hiatus. As can be expected from the British singer, songwriter, and certified tearjerker, “30” encapsulates the tough feelings of heartbreak, messing up, and maturing into a beautifully wrapped up, ballad-filled, piano-heavy package. Adele shows a new level of self-reflexivity and growth throughout the album, best epitomized by the six-minute standout “I Drink Wine.” Through 12 songs that pull influences from gospel, jazz, pop, and even a little bit of country, Adele takes listeners on a journey of finding self-awareness on “30” — one that allows her to be vulnerable, own up to her mistakes, and ask for forgiveness from both herself and her loved ones. Above all, “30” centers on hope, something that we can all use a little bit of nowadays. —Annie Harrigan
We reviewed "Easy On Me," the lead single for "30." Read more here.
5. ‘Donda’ (Kanye West)
It’s been a wild year for Kanye West. But amidst a divorce, a concert, and substantial beef in the industry, he still took the time to produce the experimental and thought-provoking album “Donda.” Whether West is voicing his grief on the mellow acoustics of “Moon,” preaching his faith on choral works like “Praise God,” or exalting the power of family throughout the nostalgic samples on “Life of the Party,” the theme of love resonates in every aspect of production on this record. It doesn’t matter what the critics had to say about it — not to Kanye nor to his fans — what matters is that Kanye did what he does best in this album and unleashed his musical genius to celebrate his late mother Donda West. Despite the messy release schedule and the public controversies, Kanye has once again proved himself to be a trendsetter who releases albums worth talking about. —Alisa S. Regassa
We wrote a think piece on “Donda.” Read more here.
4. ‘Collapsed in Sunbeams’ (Arlo Parks)
After releasing only a handful of EPs and singles in her young career, British singer-songwriter Arlo Parks delivered her first studio album in January to much acclaim. Rich with catchy beats and smooth vocals, “Collapsed in Sunbeams” has boosted Parks’s ascent to the forefront of the indie pop scene, earning her a nomination for Best New Artist at the upcoming Grammy Awards. Bouncing around Airbnb apartments to find inspiration amidst the pandemic disquiet and record songs with innovative co-writer and producer Gianluca Buccellati, Parks sought to make a statement with her debut album, exploring the tribulations of adolescence through music. The final product is tranquil and radiant, luring listeners into a world of charming rhythm and melody and leaving a rapidly growing fanbase in eager anticipation of what the young artist produces next. —Charles W. McCormick
We reviewed “Collapsed in Sunbeams” and gave it 4 stars. Read more here.
3. ‘Call Me If You Get Lost’ (Tyler, the Creator)
Tyler, the Creator embraces rap again in his sixth studio album, featuring DJ Drama who acts as the album’s narrator. “Call Me If You Get Lost” is an outstanding exploration of Black nostalgia. At times, it invites an almost-psychedelic rumination on one’s journey through life. An effervescent flute perfuses the tracks with melodic directions to the next stop on the sonic trip. Tyler’s production efforts were reinforced by Jamie xx and Jay Versace, and the longest track on the album, “SWEET / I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE,” at nine minutes and 48 seconds, exemplifies the creative genius of this production team in crafting a compelling narrative via sound engineering. “Call Me If You Get Lost” validates Tyler, the Creator as a master chameleon who consistently puts out high-quality work. —Chibuike K. Uwakwe
2. ‘Planet Her (Deluxe)’ (Doja Cat)
Doja Cat is quite a character — falling in and out of favor with the internet — yet her sorcery in the studio never fails to amaze. Her ability to traverse through genres while staying true to her distinctive style feels effortless, as she hops from an afrobeat in “Woman” to bass-boosted trap mixes of her own creation in “Up and Down.” At her core, Doja Cat is a rapper, and she’s not afraid to bring mesmeric verse and flow to her tracks much in the same vein as rapper Nicki Minaj, whose flow she references and directly expresses gratitude to in “Get Into It (Yuh).” The success of “Planet Her,” despite many of the tracks on the album already being unofficially released online, is a testament to Doja Cat’s musical prowess. —Chibuike K. Uwakwe
We reviewed the music video for “Kiss Me More” off of “Planet Her.” Read more here.
1. ‘An Evening with Silk Sonic’ (Silk Sonic) 
After a nine-month-long album roll-out, the crisp winds of November steamed with the much-anticipated release of Silk Sonic’s debut collaborative album, “An Evening with Silk Sonic.” While both members levy impressive discographies individually — Anderson .Paak’s 2020 R&B album “Ventura'' and Bruno Mars’s most recent project “24K Magic'' each left the Grammys with accolades — “An Evening with Silk Sonic'' is a sum greater than the whole of its parts. Balancing Mars’s sultry vocals and Paak’s flow with commentary from Bootsy Collins, the father of funk himself, Silk Sonic’s project is a passionate love letter to the ‘70s, paying homage to the bass lines and percussion which shaped both musicians’ distinct styles. Feeling like shea butter, flared corduroys and burnt orange velvet all rolled into one, “An Evening with Silk Sonic'' reminds listeners of a time when — as Paak told Rolling Stone — artists made music to “make women feel good, make people dance, and that’s it.”And isn’t that exactly what great music should do? — Anya L. Henry
We reviewed Silk Sonic’s debut single “Leave the Door Open” from “An Evening with Silk Sonic” and gave it 5 stars. Read more here.

10. Suez Canal Boat and Memes
The pandemic has brought no shortage of shortages. But a particularly memorable shortage back in early spring was caused by something slightly larger than a microscopic virus: a 220,000-ton container ship. On March 23, the vessel Ever Given became stuck and blocked the Suez Canal, paralyzing a route passed each day by roughly 12% of the global trade for almost a week. The bizarre news took the internet by storm, with millions observing the Egyptian authorities’ attempts to unblock the canal. Photos of the ship blocking the canal and pictures of a tiny excavator trying to dig it out turned into an immediate internet sensation and arguably became the meme of the year, dominating social media in the coming weeks. The whole World Wide Web came together thanks to a mildly amusing story of a boat that got stuck. —Zachary J. Lech
9. Bennifer 2.0
After more than a decade spent achingly apart, Cambridge’s own Ben Affleck and Jennifer “Jenny from the Block” Lopez finally — and largely unexpectedly — rekindled their inspiring romance earlier this year. The two initially met on the set of “Gigli” back in 2002, began dating, co-starred in an iconic music video, and got engaged later that same year — only to call off the wedding last minute and split up months later, citing excessive media attention as a huge impediment to their happiness as a couple. Now, in early 2021, the stars began to align for a long-anticipated reunion to take place. Affleck and Ana de Armas’ split became public in January, while Lopez and Alex Rodriguez broke up for good in April. Soon enough, Bennifer was off to Montana for a little getaway, quotes from sources around the happy couple flooded the tabloids, and things took off from there. Aside from marking yet another triumph of Red Sox over Yankees, this nostalgia-inducing relationship brought us all back to simpler times. In a generally bleak and isolating time for the world, Bennifer made us believe in true love once again — a stimulant more powerful than even the most potent Dunkin’ iced coffee. —Connor S. Dowd
8. NFTs/Christie’s Beeple Sale of $69 million
As 2021 began, it seemed like every celebrity and their mother began minting and selling NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) for an absurd amount of money. From Paris Hilton to Nyan Cat, popular culture fanatics collided with blockchain bros for the first time, catapulting the whispers of Web3 to the forefront of discussion. The art world hardly escaped the hype, and auction house Christie’s made global headlines when it sold Beeple’s “Everydays - The First 5000 Days” as a purely digital artwork and NFT for over $69 million. No shortage of art institutions and galleries lamented the sale as the inevitable death of true art, while more optimistic art entities hailed the move as the next innovative stage of commercial art practice. Regardless, Beeple’s groundbreaking sale proved NFTs and blockchain technology are bound to shake up the art world, whether you like it or not. –Hannah T. Chew
7. Carl Nassib, Jojo Siwa, and More Joining the LGBTQ+ Community
No active NFL player has ever identified as gay until Nassib, a defensive end for the Las Vegas Raiders, came out in a video posted to his Instagram in June of this year. Despite the league’s noted heteronormativity, Nassib’s announcement immediately made waves in the professional sports world and still strikes as important months later in the wake of his coach’s resignation over past use of homophobic language. Nassib’s video was joined by several other courageous messages during Pride Month, including those from actress and singer Alexandra Shipp, “American Idol” contestant David Archuleta, and actor Larry Saperstein. An icon to millions of younger fans, social media personality Jojo Siwa also came out — in true 2021 style — over TikTok in January. Like celebrities in a number of different domains, Siwa’s announcement has reached youth audiences in unprecedented fashion, helping pave the way for greater LGBTQ+ representation. —Charles W. McCormick
6. Red (Taylor’s Version)
Taylor Swift has been on quite a roll recently (although it could be argued she’s been on a roll since 2006), releasing, for all intents and purposes, two albums each year in both 2020 and 2021. This year she released the “Taylor’s Version” of her sophomore album “Fearless,” and followed it up a remake with her fourth album, “Red.” The pair of releases marked the beginning of her endeavor to reclaim ownership of her work after an embittered fight against former manager Scooter Braun, who sold the master recordings of her first six albums last year. The album features a multitude of songs that had been withheld from the original release. It also included a ten minute version (Ten! Minutes!) of the fan favorite song “All Too Well,” which replaced Don McLean’s “American Pie” as the longest song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, and came with a short film starring Dylan O’Brien to match. Though the original songs are pretty much identical to the 2012 release, the revisit, along with the array of new material, is a testament to Swift’s growth as an artist — and to the loyalty of her fans. —Sara Komatsu
We wrote about what ‘Red’ (Taylor’s Version) revealed about her ex, Jake Gyllenhaal. Read more here.
5. Megan Markle and Prince Harry interview with Oprah
Back in March, when the world could not possibly endure another convention-defying event, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, sat down with icon Oprah for a bombshell interview. The couple spoke candidly about their mistreatment by members of the royal family as well as their own struggles with mental health. Allegations of racism, deliberate neglect of security, and ill will gave a rare behind-the-scenes look into the life of British royals and their exclusivity. Since their departure from the royal family, the couple and their children have moved to California and started Archewell, a non-profit organization, and Prince Harry joined BetterUp as Chief Impact Officer. Their honest and far-reaching interview with Oprah shocked the world and Britain alike and brought critical eyes toward the outdated practices and institutions of the royal family. —Hannah T. Chew
4. Chloe Zhao Wins Best Director at the Oscars
On April 25, at the 93rd Academy Awards ceremony, Chloe Zhao won the Oscar for Best Director for her film “Nomadland.” In doing so, she set a milestone in becoming the first woman of color to win the award; she is also only the second woman ever to win as well as the first to win in over ten years. “Nomadland,” a film that depicts the nomadic lives of older Americans that live in their vehicles, also proceeded to win the awards for Best Picture and Best Actress (Frances McDormand). In her acceptance speech, Zhao paid homage to her Chinese heritage and recited in Mandarin a line from a poem called the Three Character Classic, a move that she was later praised for on Twitter and in popular media. Zhao’s Oscar’s win also made news for the censorship it received in China, where it failed to receive attention in state media outlets, and for the efforts on the part of her fans in China to celebrate her regardless. As such, Zhao’s win proved to be a bit bigger than just herself. —Daniel S. de Castro
3. Simone Biles Withdraws from Olympic Team Finals
On Jul. 27, Simone Biles shocked the world when she withdrew from the women’s gymnastics team finals at the Tokyo Olympics. “The twisties” — a mental block in which a gymnast loses spatial awareness during a routine — became a household term as she shared her reasons for staying on the sidelines. What makes this moment truly incredible is the response it garnered from the public. With the exception of some inevitable criticism, Biles received an outpouring of support from figures across sports, entertainment, politics, and more, sparking necessary conversations about mental health. These messages of encouragement brought some much-needed positivity during the pandemic and exemplified progress toward a society that values rest and the prioritization of mental wellbeing. She did so much more than stand on the Olympic podium; she took a stand against an institution that places overwhelming pressure on its athletes. This moment humanized the idol, and more importantly, did not detract from her status as the GOAT. If anything, she can wear that title with more pride than she ever has before. —Nina M. Foster
2. Lil Nas X
If 2021 were a movie, Lil Nas X just might be its star. Who else can say they gave Satan a lap dance, performed at the VMAs, became a New York Times bestselling author, had a wardrobe malfunction on SNL, got sentenced to “prison,” had a “pregnancy announcement” in People magazine, made an appearance on “Maury,” and dropped a Grammy nominated album, all in one year? Ever since the TikTok virality that first skyrocketed him to fame, Nas has proven again and again that he is just as talented a marketer as he is a musician. Throughout the year, the singer has told a story that threads between reality and fiction, each stunt slyly foreshadowing his next venture — just look at the way he used the legal controversy surrounding his unofficial Nike “Satan Shoes” to market the prison-themed music video for “INDUSTRY BABY.” Most importantly, amidst it all, Nas has always refused to compromise who he is. From his songs that speak to his experiences as a queer Black man to his passion for Twitter memes, Nas has proven that there’s not just one path to making it big in the music industry. And, if this year was any indication, it’s probably best to get a head start on your “What will Lil Nas X do in 2022?” bingo cards now. —Hunter T. Baldwin
1. Free(d) Britney
In 2008, pop legend Britney Spears was placed under a conservatorship — also known as legal guardianship — as the result of her infamous 2007/2008 public breakdowns. For thirteen years, Spears was under the control of her father Jamie Spears who oversaw her finances as well as her professional and personal lives. Although Spears’ conservatorship made news in the late 2000s, there was not much talk about it until 2019 when an episode of “Britney’s Gram,” a podcast dedicated to analyzing the singer’s Instagram posts hosted by comedians Tess Barker and Barbara Gray, went viral, sparking the #FreeBritney movement. The movement took over social media, and by July 2020, #FreeBritney saw news coverage worldwide. On Feb. 5, The New York Times premiered their documentary “Framing Britney Spears,” a one-hour fifteen-minute exposition on the popstar’s rise, fall, the conservatorship, and the “#FreeBritney” movement. In the aftermath of the documentary, the media, other celebrities, and the general public reckoned with just how poorly Britney Spears was treated in the 2000s. Celebrity journalism outlets recalled how they treated Spears twenty years prior. Male celebrities, most notably Justin Timberlake (Spears’ ex), apologized for their participation in systems of misogyny. As a result of the documentary, the #FreeBritney movement grew tenfold, sparking outrage over the conservatorship that Spears’ had been under for 13 years and in June 2021, Spears made her first public statement asking for the termination of her conservatorship, citing abuse from her father, family, and management. After a months-long legal battle, on Nov. 12, Britney Spears’ conservatorship was terminated and #FreeBritney became #FreedBritney. —Annie Harrigan

10. ‘Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings’ (Destin Daniel Cretton)
Marvel’s first Asian-led superhero action flick won’t earn many points for novel filmmaking techniques, but it earns its place on this list as an important film for representation — not just through casting, but through stories. On the surface, Shang-Chi’s (Simu Liu) arc looks similar to many MCU origin stories: He’s a character who tries to forge a new path for himself, which is complicated by a strained relationship with his father (Tony Leung). But writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton takes that conflict much deeper — exploring the importance of balancing legacy and identity in Asian American culture. Hopefully, “Shang-Chi” can also be a gateway for a wider audience to enjoy the martial arts films that inspired the MCU hit. Some places to start include Wong Kar-wai “The Grandmaster” or Zhang Yimou’s “Hero” (both of which also star Tony Leung) or Stephen Chow’s “Kung Fu Hustle” (which makes a cameo appearance as a movie poster in Shang-Chi’s room in San Francisco). —Lanz Aaron G. Tan
9. ‘Annette’ (Leos Carax)
Love it, hate it, meme it: No film released this year was more divisive than Leos Carax’s surreal musical fantasia “Annette.” Originating as a pop-rock-opera concept album written by the archly arty duo Sparks, the resulting film polarized audiences at Cannes in June and landed on unsuspecting Prime Video viewers like a bomb of weirdness in August. The titular character — the gifted child of tortured stand-up comic Henry McHenry (Adam Driver) and winsome opera star Ann Desfranoux (Marion Cotillard) — becomes an international singing sensation after Henry discovers his infant daughter’s angelic voice. Yes, baby Annette is “played” by a wooden marionette puppet. No, Driver does not sing while performing cunnilingus— not quite. (He’s taking breaks!) But through all its layers of oddity, provocation, and repetitive lyrics, “Annette” works best as a modern fable about the explosive intensity of love and the illusory tragedy of fame. Carax’s big-budget experimental melodrama of a film — his first in English — is both winkingly and devastatingly sincere at every turn. —Amelia Roth-Dishy
8. ‘Encanto’ (Jared Bush and Byron Howard)
“Encanto,” Walt Disney Animation Studios’ 60th animated movie, is truly enchanting, offering much more than captivating visuals grounded in Hispanic culture. The film follows the Madrigals, a Colombian family, whose members have supernatural powers that they use to help their neighbors in the town of Encanto. Unbeknownst to them, the magic is waning, threatening their home and their whole community. Young Maribel, neglected by her family as the only one without a gift, resolves to save the family. The stunning cinematography paired with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s catchy songs already makes for an audiovisual feast. But more importantly, “Encanto” proves to be an enthralling, inspirational story of ordinary family struggles set in an extraordinary setting that emphasizes the importance of caring for each other. While the film’s ending slightly undermines the beautiful message, “Encanto” might well be Disney’s best animated feature since “Frozen.” —Zachary J. Lech
7. ‘Candyman’ (Nia DaCosta)
Like any worthwhile horror film, DaCosta’s “Candyman” is more than just a campfire story with fake jump scares — on the contrary, it is grounded in believable and psychologically harrowing narratives. Jordan Peele’s script follows visual artist Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) trying to find his childhood home in the projects of Chicago. The film chronicles how he loses himself to an obsession with a terrifying local myth about Candyman, a man who was murdered and can be summoned in the mirror, only to find himself transforming into Candyman himself. The screenwriting breaks the mirage of generic villain mysticism by applying a historical explanation to the previously unexplainable origins of Candyman, revealing racial injustice as the real antagonist. “Candyman” stays relevant and important to the modern black experience by enrapturing the audience in a more lifelike tale that transcends the mirror into the present. —Alisa S. Regassa
We reviewed “Candyman” and gave it 4 Stars. Read more here.
6. ‘In the Heights’ (Jon M. Chu)
“In the Heights,” the film adaptation of the 2008 Broadway hit from Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegría Hudes, is exceptional in its multidimensional representations of the Latinx diaspora. Set in New York’s primarily Dominican Washington Heights neighborhood, the film follows Usnavi (Anthony Ramos), a bodega owner whose dreams to move back home to the Dominican Republic are accelerated by the gentrification rapidly overtaking the barrio. Through him, the film weaves an intimate story of Latinidad, the American Dream, and the immigrant experience. The result is stunning: a refreshing and colorful mosaic of community life. “In the Heights” remains largely singular in its depictions of Latinidad in a media landscape dominated by white men. Still, it’s impossible to praise the film without engaging with its problems, too. Since its debut, it has cultivated significant criticism for the lack of dark-skinned Afro-Latinx actors in its lead roles — a clear product of colorism and anti-Blackness. If nothing else, the film brings with it a call to shine a spotlight on more stories from and about Latinx communities, as no singular film can possibly undo the long, harmful history of Hollywood representations. —Sofia Andrade
5. ‘King Richard’ (Reinaldo Marcus Green)
Will Smith stars in the uplifting sports drama “King Richard” as Richard Williams, the loving and stubborn father of tennis stars Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena Williams (Demi Singleton). Richard has his mind set on his two youngest daughters becoming world-class players; the film documents Richard and his wife Oracene’s (Aunjanue Ellis) relentless efforts to get them the training and support they need to go pro. As the film follows Venus and Serena’s rise to fame in the predominantly white sport of tennis, it never fails to acknowledge the significance of their presence in spaces that have historically excluded girls that look like them. In one scene, Richard says to Venus, “You not gonna just be representing you. You gonna be representing every little Black girl on Earth.” Smith chokes up as he delivers this line, and it’s in emotionally-charged moments like these that we see the care and effort he put into his performance. “King Richard” is worth watching for Smith’s powerful performance as well as its heartwarming portrayals of familial bonds and personal triumphs. —Jaden S. Thompson
4. ‘Licorice Pizza’ (Paul Thomas Anderson)
Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson’s coming-of-age comedy “Licorice Pizza” takes viewers on a dream-like romp around the San Fernando Valley in 1970s Los Angeles. Equal parts funny and endearing, Anderson’s latest is about finding love in the unlikeliest of places, and wanting to grow up, only to find yourself lost once you get there. Most of all, it’s a love letter to Hollywood — an ode to the insecurities of growing up in a town where everybody knows exactly what they want to do next. Anderson wrote “Licorice Pizza” for Alana Haim, and her scintillating debut performance is the brightest spot in the film. Ultimately, “Licorice Pizza” is a beautifully-shot exploration of adolescence, shifting gears from delicate happiness to sobering insecurity, all tied together with an indulgent flicker of 35mm nostalgia. —Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed “Licorice Pizza” and gave it 5 Stars. Read more here.
3. 'Drive My Car' (Ryusuke Hamaguchi)
There are few movies that stay with you for months afterward the way that “Drive My Car” does. Over the film’s almost 3-hour run time, Japanese Director Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s perfectly-calibrated leads bicker and dance around each other in a quiet yet also thunderous story about facing the deepest recesses of our own ugliness and living on anyway. “Drive My Car” is a story that threatens to swallow the viewer with the magnitude of its emotion — but then, right at the edge, extends instead an aching, deeply-felt hope. —Joy C. Ashford
We reviewed “Drive My Car” at the Cannes Film Festival and gave it 5 Stars. Read more here.
2. ‘Titane’ (Julia Ducournau)
In “Titane,” French director Julia Ducournau has somehow topped both the gore and the biting satire of her beloved debut, “Raw.” So many layers of meaning hum underneath this strange, exquisite film — from a visceral tearing-apart of the gender binary to a refreshing reversal of the disempowering kinds of stories about sexual assault the film industry — and many of “Titane”’s competitors — are currently saturated with. But the crowning jewel of the first-ever woman-directed film to win Cannes’ top award solo is its lead Agathe Rousselle, who rages and sobs and gyrates with a fury few others have come close to. —Joy C. Ashford
We reviewed “Drive My Car” at the Cannes Film Festival and gave it 4.5 Stars. Read more here.
1. ‘Judas and the Black Messiah’ (Shaka King)
Writer and director Shaka King’s “Judas and the Black Messiah” successfully earned its reputation as a gripping and powerful portrait of Chairman Fred Hampton and the Illinois Black Panther Party. King’s film follows the charismatic young Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya) as he passionately leads the 1960’s Black Panthers in actions towards radical justice while also centering William O’Neal (LaKeith Stanfield), the party member whose betrayal led to Hampton’s assassination. Exploring themes of Black power, structural racism, community solidarity, and state violence, “Judas and the Black Messiah” grounds itself in the present — forcing viewers to reckon with the glaring continuities of racial injustice experienced in the modern era. When combined with powerful leading performances, compelling screenwriting, and nostalgic cinematography, “Judas and the Black Messiah'' successfully humanizes the fight for radical racial equality and, in doing so, makes important strides towards restoring the legacy of the Black Panther Party. —Anya L. Henry
We reviewed “Judas and the Black Messiah” while at Sundance and gave it 4.5 Stars. Read more here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Readers,
It is with profound joy — and a tinge of sadness — that we present the ninth edition of The Crimson Arts’ Year-in-Review.
As the first (and, hopefully, last) set of Arts chairs to begin their jobs virtually, we knew we had a difficult task ahead of us. The Arts Board of The Crimson prides itself on fostering a distinct sense of community, and it’s hard to maintain that same degree of endearing, unhinged banter over Zoom.
Hard, but not impossible.
Zoom production nights were just as efficient as in-person ones (that is, not very). We hosted Arts Dinner Dates and virtual Oscars watch parties. We never stopped sharing our favorite artistic depictions. Despite being thousands of miles apart, our community grew even stronger, and — amidst some of the darkest moments of this often-awful year — felt more like home than ever before.
And of course, in between the late night unhinged messages and Zooms that probably should have ended a few hours earlier, we did some work, too. This year, we published over 500 pieces, from personal essays about anime to reviews of Harry Styles. We covered the Cannes Film Festival, the Governors Ball, and the return of in-person theater to Harvard. We asked “What The Hell Happened?” — over and over and over again. We ranked every episode of “Avatar: The Last Airbender.” We opined about the flaws of color-blind casting. We wrote about the Super Bowl (and the Sports board didn’t). Our content received over 2.3 million pageviews: a resounding testament to the importance of arts journalism.
And of course, none of this would be possible without Jamie and Amanda, our fearless leaders; Ashley, our supremely talented (and unwaveringly patient) designer; Zing, Thomas, Andrew, and Cory, our multimedia team; and of course, Amelia, Connor, and Hunter — our rocks, our swiss army knives, our EALs. Thank you, for everything.
We are also forever indebted to the Chairs who came before us, who helped us fall in love with Arts and taught us everything we know about doing this crazy, exhausting, wonderful, magical job. To Caroline and Kaylee, thank you for welcoming us to Arts — first as compers and then as execs — for initiating us into the cult of Shrek, and for letting us sit at the cool kids’ table. To Ally and Iris, thank you for teaching us to take responsibility for the community and culture we create, and for sacrificing so much to leave this organization better than you found it.
Thanks, also, to our execs. We are in the privileged position of only having to proof articles once they are in their final stages of editing, after they’ve been cleaned and gutted and reassembled and polished by a world-class team of editors.
And last but not least, thank you to the staff writers. Every week, we find ourselves laughing or crying or lost in thought after reading your articles, astonished by your talent and wit and insight. Thank you for making Crimson Arts a part of your time at Harvard, and thank you for your dedication, your spirit, and your words.
Coming back to campus this semester felt, in many ways, like a new beginning, and as such, we find ourselves in the strange position of concluding our time as Arts Chairs just as we feel like we’re getting started. As we sit here, around the table on the south side of the Newsroom, surrounded by some of the kindest, wittiest, most talented people we know, approaching our fourth hour of fixing comma splices and adding square brackets, a feeling comes to mind — to quote Olaf in “Frozen II,” the cinematic masterpiece of our time: “Oh, how I wish this could last forever.”
But time stops for no man (except for us — because we both took gap years and will still be haunting The Crimson as jaded dino ghosts for a year and a half to come). As hard as it is to say goodbye, we could not be more confident in the people who will lead this community into its next chapter. Your brilliant instincts, creative ideas, and commitment to making this place more kind, equitable, and loving than you found it have kept us going through countless late-night meetings on Zoom and in the Newsroom. We are inexpressibly excited to see the new heights to which Jaden, Sofi, and the rest of the exec team will take the Arts board in the year to come, and are so grateful to have worked with you over the past year.
With every remaining ounce of our Arts-love,
Kalos K. Chu and Joy C. Ashford
Arts Chairs of the 148th Guard of The Harvard Crimson

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I haven’t always liked Christopher Nolan’s “Inception.” In fact, when I first watched the movie, I didn’t even make it past the opening scene before I turned it off, demonstrating how stupid I thought it was. Since then, however, I’ve watched the movie (to completion) a handful of times; and although I returned to it at first to ward off complaints from friends that were frustrated with how few movies I’d seen, I eventually fell in love with the movie myself.
Of course, a part of me still thinks it’s stupid. The premise of the movie — the idea that one can enter and explore the carefully controlled dream of someone else — requires a level of suspension of disbelief that I am often (nearly always) unwilling to give. The stakes of the movie also just seem way higher than they need to be: I still have yet to understand why the movie was made to feel like an off-brand secret-agent thriller.
The depth of the characters — or lack thereof — has also always stood out (and annoyed me) as one of the movie’s points of weakness. Indeed, nearly all the characters seem exceedingly archetypal. Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt), Cobb’s (Leonardo DiCaprio) right-hand man, for example, always disappointed me as a carbon copy of the archetype of the buttoned-up, risk-averse, a-little-too rational friend. Most frustrating of all is Cobb himself, who is just sickeningly perfect, being not only a grieving husband unwavering in his love for his late wife, but also a man driven by the single overwhelming desire to see his children. In this way, even Cobb’s flaws are tied to his morally irreproachable character. Just a little more thought put into these characters would have made the movie so much better.
Yet, time and time again I find myself turning on “Inception,” and the more I think about it, the more I struggle to explain why. I hate to say it, but I’ve never been more engulfed in a movie than the first time I watched “Inception” all the way through. Somehow, even though it seems so dumb when I think about it later, the idea of getting lost in a dream inside a dream never fails to fascinate me. And though I have a hard time remembering what exactly I find so groundbreaking about Nolan’s film, I do know that my mind is absolutely blown each time I reach its end.
At the end of the day, my opinion of “Inception” at any given moment has much more to do with my current state of mind than anything else. If I am my usual, critically-thinking self, then I won’t hesitate to call “Inception” a bad movie, full stop. However, “Inception” will never fail to command my attention and curiosity if I am feeling a bit more relaxed, a bit sleepier, and, perhaps, a bit hungrier than normal. It is in these moments that I would go so far as to admit, with more than a modicum of truth, that “Inception” is indeed one of my favorite movies of all time.

Every Monday night starting at around 8 p.m., after the Arts meeting concludes but before News begins their nightly toil, all of the Arts execs file out of the Sanctum, down the stairs, and into the Newsroom — staking our claim to the big table by the Sports office, where we will camp out for three to five hours until the week’s pieces are published.
Crimson Arts production night is, most weeks, a chaotic affair — a fever dream fueled by stolen cans of Celcius and Joy’s third iced coffee of the day. Monday night isn’t exactly known for being the time of the week when everyone is at peak energy, a fact made abundantly clear when there are a billion pieces to edit, proof, and publish.
And yet, production night is quite a beautiful thing, too. Amidst the chaos, patterns emerge. Lanz complains about a comper while Jaden reins him in. Harper, Joe, and Sofi plan out the rest of their night (which usually involves a 1–3 a.m. shift at WHRB). Clara nudges Joy and me to actually do our jobs so she can get home before her unfathomably healthy bedtime. Hunter, Connor, and Amelia finish their EAL duties and yeet out as soon as possible — leaving the fate of who gets to go home in the hands of the easily distracted Arts Chairs.
In our defense, it is quite easy to get distracted. From debates about the merits (or lack thereof) of “The Prom” to group screenings of
Architectural Digest “Open Door” videos to live reenactments of Ted Cruz’s famous rendition of “Why am I persecuted?” — production night is perhaps the greatest pop culture melting pot since the invention of Twitter. Nowhere have I heard more compelling defenses of Martin Scorcese or Tom Brady or Timothée Chalamet — and nowhere have I learned more about “Glee” or Harry Styles or what an album is — than at production night.
Indeed, looking back on my time at Harvard, there’s no other way I would have rather spent my Monday nights — surrounded by laughter and love and good spirits and friends who care about art as much as I do.
At the end of every production night, the Chairs send out a closeouts email — a recap of the week’s articles and the night’s antics that always begins with a selection of quotes from the night. And so, as a final love letter to production night, I present: a poem composed entirely of quotes from these closeouts emails — a record, a relic, a portrait of this odd, exhausting, crazy, wonderful thing that is Crimson Arts.

"No. I’m writing it.” —SA

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I hate being bipolar, it’s awesome” — Kanye West.
Like most things Kanye says and does, this quote somehow sounds both ludicrous and pretentious yet somehow profoundly and bizarrely deep at the same time. From models with bleached assholes (1:10 “Father Stretch My Hands, Pt 1.”) to conversations with Jesus about who’s most high (2:22 “I Am A God''), Yeezus has often increased awareness about bipolar disorder through the comical shock value of his music.
Now I’m well aware, having bipolar disorder isn’t a joking matter. The depression lows and the manic highs suck, and being in between is somehow even worse. But it need not be swept under the rug or talked about behind closed doors: both of those things only make it even harder to live with. Instead, this arts vanity calls on the spirit of Yeezus to guide the reader on a heartwarming — and at times comical — journey of bipolar disorder through the mood swings of my expertly-curated playlists. (These playlists, of course, are also made superior by virtue of being on Apple Music and not Spotify.)
As a fuck you to the stereotypes and an ode to my ~eclectic~ music taste, I present: bipolar disorder, the playlist edition.
“Ctrl. Alt. Delete This Playlist”
The first signs are ambiguous. One may feel more quirky on certain occasions — have a little more pep in their step, per se. It’s nothing too noticeable: you have to squint to see the red flags. Likewise, this alternative playlist looks harmless on the surface: The Black Keys, Cage The Elephant, The Kooks. Upon a closer look, it becomes clear that trouble is near as the choices devolve into downright weird 20th century songs like Jacques Dutronc’s “Les Cactus” and Lio’s “Le Banana Split.”
“All You Ladies K-Pop Your P*ssy Like This”
Chart manipulation, koreaboos, saesangs — K-pop is a maniacal industry. Whether Red Velvet’s “Psycho” hits a little close to home is irrelevant, because you can’t stop someone who’s manic from spending their “Money” on Lalisa from Blackpink. Red lights should flash and alarms should blare when you walk in on them back-up dancing butt-naked to J.Y. Park’s 2019 MAMA performance.
“Rock n’ Roll n’ Get Away From Me”
Nothing says self-absorbed like emo-rock. Shouting angsty Metallica lyrics like “nothing else matters” is a desperate cry for help, but don’t try to call out someone who is on the verge of a depression swing, for this My Chemical Romance phase will surely “scare the shit out of you.”
“Classy-Cal for This Depressy-Gal”
Not much to say about this one. If all you can stand to listen to is “Symphony in G Minor,” you’re more into the thick of depression than Bach was when he wrote it.
“Nostalgia and Le Cordon Blues”
A musical rendition of Jeopardy’s potpourri answer category, these questionably hodgepodge choices — The Weeknd, Muse, and The Neighbourhood — have nothing to do with each other. But they have everything to do with evoking emotional memories from the melodies, which is essential in this period of post-depression nothingness. When you are heavily medicated and can’t feel anything, the bittersweet modulations on Rex Orange County’s “Pluto Projector” can be the only thing to remind them to keep going.
— Incoming Music Exec Alisa S. Regassa swears she writes music reviews to absolve herself of the sin of joint concentrating in STEM. She quotes the “It’s Like A Reward” TikTok on a daily basis as she sits down to write her nth music review of a Weeknd single that no one, including herself, will ever read, as a break from working on her psets. She also frequently pinches her thumb and forefinger to illustrate that she is “this close” to “risking it all” and pursuing a career in music journalism (more commonly known as unemployment). Email alisa.regassa@thecrimson.com to cast your vote of confidence (she needs it).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the common room of our Lowell suite, one of my eight blockmates posed the question which would come to redefine our relationship forever: What would you give up to meet your favorite celebrity?
Sounding off round-robin, others mentioned spending exorbitant amounts of money, flashing a cheeky side boob, or jumping off of random surfaces. When the spotlight shone on me, I shared my truth: “I would gladly and consensually auction my kidney off for the chance to meet Bruno Mars.” There were gasps, cackles, and further interrogation, yet my stance has remained steady ever since.
At the ripe age of 10, a doe-eyed young Anya clutched a stack of Silly Bandz in one hand and a light blue iPod Touch in the other. With the $10 iTunes gift card she received for some forgotten holiday, she purchased her own music for the very first time. Her music of choice just so happened to be the entirety of Mars’s 2010 album “Doowops and Hooligans.”
For weeks, I listened to only this album, laughing at the word “sex” in “The Lazy Song” and wondering if I would really ever love someone enough to catch a grenade for them. While I was blissfully unable to understand heartbreak and still believed Disney’s myths that high school would be the pinnacle of my life experience, Mars’s music provided an escape that did not require higher thinking. His debut album mirrored the ways younger me felt emotions: Tracks oscillated from the highest highs to the lowest lows, interspersing normal events with hyperbole and transforming minor setbacks into dystopia. It was dramatic and immature — and so was I.
Following the release of his two most recent projects, “24K Magic” and “An Evening with Silk Sonic,” it’s clear how much he has grown as an artist and concurrently, how much I’ve grown with him. These albums are funkier, sexier, angrier, and more intentional. They stray away from pure pop to incorporate experimental bass lines, hip hop, and rap features. Listening to his newer music showcases a deeper Bruno Mars — one who has seen enough of the world to know what he likes, who he wants, what he hates, and how he wants to change.
Like Mars, I’ve also grown to understand the complexities behind emotions: I’ve felt love, lust, longing, and grief. I’ve wanted someone to love me back in the way that I desired, and been angry when they couldn’t. I’ve shook a lil’ somethin’ on the dance floor, and left a few — non-Versace — pieces of clothing on the floor.
I guess what I’m saying is that as much as Bruno Mars represents my past, he also represents my present and, given our track record, will likely be a constant in my future. Therefore, in my humble opinion, this connection deserves to be rewarded through a minor organ redistribution.
As my TikTok feed never fails to remind me, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Life is dictated by currencies — time, money, bodily organs — and who is to determine what truly distinguishes the ethical from the morbid? I am the proud owner of two kidneys, and it is my prerogative, out of the kindness of my heart and an undying love for Bruno, to sell it for the high price of a lengthy and personalized Bruno Mars meet-and-greet experience.

You’re leaving your River house hallway single for the day. It’s boring. Drab. You convince yourself that you’re satisfied with your living situation as images of your uninspired room and its neutral, decoration-less walls flash across your mind.
You’re on your way to the Quad to see some friends. “Why do all the cool people live so far away?” you ask yourself. You’re standing outside Cabot House, when suddenly you look up and spot a dazzling light show through a window on the fourth floor of E-entry, accompanied by the distant pulse of Doja Cat’s new album “Planet Her.” Enchanted, you make your way up the stairs and spot a door with the same aura as red wine, puppies, and the shampoo aisle at CVS.
You knock. I open. You enter, immediately teleporting far away from the suffocating beige of unadorned dorm rooms to a new realm with twinkling Christmas lights, a movie poster for “The Truman Show,” two thriving succulents, and a gel air freshener — domestic bliss.
I wish I could say you’re the first person to realize how much more homey your home could be, but unfortunately, this is a daily — nay, hourly — experience for me. Many underestimate the power of a few household garnishes here and there, but interior dorm design isn’t something one can pick up willy-nilly. Indeed, decorating without forethought or planning can yield catastrophic results. Everyone knows someone who taped up a single Frank Ocean “Blonde” poster without doing anything else. If you don’t, it’s probably you.
Interior dorm design is a game of complements — what do you pair with those “Kill Bill'' prints to let people know you’re not a male manipulator? What color LED lights match the vibe of the Adele album masking your midterm crying sessions? It’s an interdisciplinary study and thus requires expertise in, among other things, geometry, sociology, archeology, paleoanthropology, astrology, biology, psychobiology, catachronobiology, selenomorphology, otorhinolaryngology, and physics. Dean Gay hasn’t yet responded to my 18 emails about making interior dorm design a concentration available to undergraduates, but its academic rigor certainly merits attention from the College.
All jokes aside, I think surrounding yourself with art is one of the most important measures you can take to separate yourself from the monotony of everyday collegiate life. A “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” poster next to my bed reminds me not to take school too seriously. Framed prints from an artist who sits outside the T station every Sunday tell me how unique the city I’m living in is. Posters of Georgia O'Keeffe’s swirling, radiant flowers offer a vibrant reminder of childhood in Albuquerque. The right pieces of the visual art puzzle coming together can make the difference between chaos without respite and peace in a bastion of comfort, even if purchased cheaply off eBay and pretty low-res.
Each dorm is a blank canvas upon which we project our interests to be recognized by others. As such, there are only a handful of acceptable ornaments in addition to the ones mentioned above that you can choose to fill the negative space. Here’s a pretty exhaustive list:
A life-size Harry Styles cutout
Stoner door beads
A “Live, Laugh, Love” poster
Anything and everything tiger print
A second, more imposing Harry Styles cutout
A tower of empty beer cans (You must have shotgunned them all yourself, at least 15)

A “Live, Laugh, Love” poster

Let your imagination run wild. This Arts vanity is only tangentially related to any art reviewed by the Board this year, but establishing a home base for yourself on campus in a deliberate and thoughtful manner is supremely important. I wish you the best as you embark on your interior dorm design journey, and don’t forget the golden rule: If nothing else works out, just buy a “Saturdays Are For The Boys” flag.

Falling asleep used to be easy before the constant laughter of four middle-aged men from Staten Island began to seep into my thoughts, forcing a constant reckoning with the reality of my own human existence.
To the uninitiated, the so-called Jokers came together to film their long-running hidden camera comedy series, “Impractical Jokers,” all the way back in 2011. The four stars — Joe Gatto, James “Murr” Murray, Brian “Q” Quinn, and Sal Vulcano — are members of a comedy group called the “Tenderloins,” which they formed some time after they graduated from high school together.
The series premiered — and continues to run — on truTV. Haven’t heard of truTV? Wondering what kind of programming they offer? Well, let me tell you. They offer an unhealthy serving of all “Impractical Jokers” almost all the time. Take, for instance, their schedule for Tuesday, Dec. 21: For eight consecutive hours, from 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., the channel will air nothing but “Impractical Jokers” and associated spin-offs. This lineup is not unusual, either, lest the reader think that there must be some kind of special marathon event happening. It’s just another Tuesday. The series has been running for more than 10 years now, and in that time, it has produced more than 200 episodes, more than 35 specials, and even a feature film. In a media age defined by a constant churn of new content, few creators can match the raw unyielding output of this prolific bunch.
The show’s premise is simple — each member of the foursome undertakes different challenges every episode in which they prank innocent bystanders under the instruction of the other three comedians. Failure to execute the prank as instructed results in a “strike,” and the Joker with the most strikes at the end of the episode is declared the “big loser.” A desire to thrust this shameful label onto a competitor drives the comedians to push the limits of practicality — their jokes become increasingly impractical as their desperation grows, and the result is unadulterated chaos.
The ignominy associated with this “big loser” title is nothing compared to the terrible punishment that accompanies it. In one episode, Murr, who has a crippling fear of heights, was forced to skydive. In another, Sal was forced to watch his sister legally marry one of the other Jokers. Their creativity seemingly knows no bounds, and as a result nobody and nothing is sacred in the world of “Impractical Jokers.”
The influence of the Jokers’ brazen willingness to push their comedy past practical limits has slowly embedded itself into my consciousness since the fateful day years ago when, home sick from school, I left truTV on for too long after watching a college basketball game and felt myself drift into a trance-like state as the crazed laughter of these four New Yorkers traveled up the Northeast Corridor to my home in Suburban Massachusetts and infiltrated my feverish brain.
Since then, I have never been able to look at strangers the same way. Any person who approaches me in public could be an impractical joker in disguise, for all I know. Who knows what could happen to me if I catch the Jokers on a day when they’ve run out of reasonable ideas, and they decide to push their comedy to an unprecedented level of impracticality? I can almost hear it now: “Push him into moving traffic, Sal, unless you want to be tonight’s big loser! Hahahahahaha!”
Worse still, what if my entire existence has been one big impractical joke? Could the C+ I received on a seventh grade art project have been the result of truTV paying off my teacher? When I lost my headphones last year, were they actually stolen by a cackling Staten Island native? Is my entire extended family and friend group composed of trained actors, operating constantly under the guidance of “The Tenderloins?”
Once you start asking yourself these questions, you can never stop. You see the faces of the Jokers in every room. In public places, you feel a sense of impractical-joke-induced dread wash over you until you have no choice but to return to the safety of your own room. I have never been to Staten Island, and now I am not sure if I could ever bring myself to visit. Despite his impressive dating history, Pete Davidson is far from the most powerful man to emerge from that godforsaken borough. Not even he has achieved a level of impracticality beyond the scope of the “Impractical Jokers.”
Camus once wrote that “A man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it.” Whether or not he was a regular viewer of truTV, we may never know, but he clearly had a sense for the existential reckoning that an afternoon watching four grown men play pranks on strangers can induce.
To my fellow Crimson Arts writers and executives, thank you for grounding my existence in a place where the discovery of shrimp in a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch can dominate the attention of our readers, nobody is willing to rank every musical performance from the hit TV show “Glee,” and our entire board of this publication lives and dies according to the whims of a self-proclaimed “gassy boy.” It’s been a pleasure.
—Outgoing Social EAL / Unofficial Film EAL / EAL’s Corner Executive Connor S. Dowd has been a social experiment conducted by truTV in association with the “Impractical Jokers.” Don’t tell him that we told you or else you’ll ruin the prank.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As one of the incoming Culture Executive Editors, I feel it is necessary to foreground the many failures that inspired my rise. I am not, of course, talking about any failure of my own doing. Rather, I’d like to discuss the cultural flops that live most potently in my heart, mind, and cultural sensibility.
1. WeWork
If you have not watched or read one of the many, many pieces covering the chaotic saga and downfall of cult leader Adam Neumann and the We Company (parent to WeWork), I cannot recommend them enough. As a Silicon Valley native and avid critic of the industry I grew up next door to, the entire ordeal (which, by the way, is still unfolding) is a wonderful condemnation of startup culture and the “unicorn” mentality. The absurd amount of money thrown around by tech investors paired with hideously minimalist start-up aesthetics could be the butt of a never-ending joke, and WeWork is just one example of many. Nothing quite dismantles the myth of meritocracy and bullsh*t diversity statements of the Valley like the massive, public failure of one of its star prodigies.
2. The Cronut
I am absolutely guilty of waiting in line for an hour in the New York humidity to experience the Dominique Ansel Bakery’s viral Cronut creation. A cross between a croissant and donut, the Cronut is just another decadent, Instagram-tailored foodie trend, but it managed to have a chokehold on us for the better part of 2013. They’re honestly just okay, a little too sugary and rich to eat more than once in a blue moon, and create a whole mess of crumbs and sugar. However, I admit I still see them every time I walk into a Paris Baguette or side street bakery, so who am I to try and disparage their culinary legacy?
3. #Girlboss
When I say “the girlboss font,” most people can now picture the overused millennial pink and obnoxious catchphrases on office mugs. Birthed by the valiant effort to increase women in leadership and business, the Girlboss quickly became the next White Tumblr Feminist in the matter of a few years. Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos comes to mind as the perfect absurd manifestation of the Girlboss mentality, while the infamous “Call Her Daddy ” podcast exemplifies some of the title’s most paradoxical and ineffective teachings. The “Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss'' maxim floating around Tiktok and Twitter sums up the cultural fate of the Girlboss quite well.
4. Culottes
My crusade against culottes in fashion is a purely personal preference. However, I would like to stop seeing modern fashion attempts to resurrect these stupid, baggy, capri pants every few years. It truly never works, because whether they are linen, denim, patterned, or worn by a celebrity, culottes have absolutely no utility or aesthetic appeal. The combination of the awkward mid-calf length and excessive amount of fabric for a pair of pants is absolutely unacceptable — there are just so many better options in both the skirt and pant categories. Do not let me catch you wearing culottes.
5. The Bowl Trend
In Washington D.C. this summer, every time I went out for lunch, I inevitably ended up at a bowl place. This is not a typical rant against the proliferation of sweetgreen, but rather a condemnation of the restaurant industry’s move toward putting everything in a goddamn customizable bowl. Looking for a falafel? CAVA or SAJJ Bowl! Craving Korean food? Moonbowls or Bibim box! Craving raw fish? Go get a poke bowl! I enjoy the occasional açaí bowl as much as the next Californian, but the desire to turn everything into a Chipotle-esque fast casual experience needs to stop. While these bowls supposedly give customers the freedom of customization, it’s unnecessary and exhausting and somehow you always end up with a weird combination of ingredients you like independently but definitely not together. Plus, chefs are quite literally trained to learn what pairs best together, so why have we decided to stop listening to them in favor of our own delusional preferences?
There are many, many more culture flops I have rants about, but they all deserve their own essays. As your new incoming Co-Culture Executive Editor, I pledge to make sure they each get their own chance in the spotlight and are properly condemned.
— To hear more controversial and slightly less coherent culture rants or egregiously well-thought-out anti-Silicon Valley propaganda, reach out to incoming Co-Culture Executive Editor Hannah T. Chew at hannah.chew@thecrimson.com, and she would be happy to discuss them over a Cronut.

Has anyone ever told you that you’re terrible at communicating your feelings? Or that you don’t know how to resolve an argument? Or maybe someone called you emotionally unavailable? Well, listen up, because I have the perfect solution: “Avatar: The Last Airbender.”
I always looked forward to watching reruns of “Avatar” with my sibling in the wee hours of the morning before going to elementary school. We would laugh together at the cabbage merchant’s cart getting repeatedly destroyed, cower from Koh the Face Stealer, and cheer for Aang’s victories. The show holds a special place in my heart, but it wasn’t until I rewatched it as a twenty-year-old that I realized almost all of my emotional intelligence can be attributed to the series.
On our first night back on campus, my roommate revealed that she had never watched the series all the way through. Naturally, we took on the mission of watching all three seasons over the course of the fall semester. From the very beginning, I was taken aback by how emotionally mature 12-year-old Aang, 14-year-old Katara, and 15-year-old Sokka could be. Take, for example, what Katara said while helping Aang out of the Avatar State when he finds out the Air Temple was invaded by the Fire Nation:
“Aang, I know you’re upset, and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family… We’re your family now,” she said.
In just a few sentences, Katara handles the situation with more grace than any teenager I’ve ever encountered. She diffuses Aang’s anger and brings him back to reality. She recognizes and validates his emotions, then establishes a connection by sharing her own experience with grief. Lastly, she ends on a message of support, ensuring that he does not feel alone in his pain.
As the show progresses and the subject matter intensifies, so does the characters’ management of emotions. Each episode contains valuable lessons about dealing with love, loss, fear, and every feeling in between.
I believe “Avatar” should be required viewing for everyone, everywhere. The show is so much more than quality entertainment and art. It’s an incredibly effective tool for social-emotional learning, guaranteed to instill empathy and an aptitude for emotional communication in its viewers. I’m proud to say that most of my emotional intelligence stems from my absorption of “Avatar” as a child, and you can bet that I will be showing the series to my future children. Just imagine how many of today’s issues could be solved if we all lived by these characters’ examples.
Where does the other one percent of my emotional intelligence come from? Family, friends, education, social upbringing — the usual suspects. But nothing compares to the lessons I’ve learned from Aang and the rest of the gang.
— Incoming Books Exec Nina M. Foster ‘23 can be reached at nina.foster@thecrimson.com and will happily befriend anyone who agrees that Katara and Zuko should have ended up together, or fight anyone who thinks that Aang and Katara are the perfect match.

“If you want to know someone, just look at the Disney Channel Original Movie they watched on repeat in their childhood.” —Proverb
In my opinion, nothing else captures the ethos of the aughts and early 2010s quite as well as the cultural movement that was Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOM). As I look back at this treasure trove of television films, I can’t help but marvel at how lucky we were to grow up during the Disney Renaissance. (I know the term “Disney Renaissance” technically refers to the slate of films released by The Walt Disney Studios between 1989 and 1999; however, we shouldn’t overlook the fact that Disney Channel clearly had a Renaissance of its own.)
I find it hard to believe that more recent DCOMs could possibly have the same charm as those released between the years of 2010 and 2015 — a period that I am roughly defining as Disney Channel’s heyday. Year after year, Disney Channel cranked out films that were both instant hits and reflective works of art, many of which went on to claim their rightful place in the film canon (In the modern age, many have also recaptured the attention of social media; see the 2020 resurgence of “Radio Rebel” and its memes.)
The Disney Channel Renaissance was an unparalleled epoch for arts and culture. The DCOM undoubtedly pushed the boundaries of what the made-for-television movie could — and should — be. Of course, not every DCOM was masterful in concept or execution, but even the duds among the bunch found ways to be genuinely endearing (I’m still not sure I get “Hatching Pete,” but I can appreciate its vision nonetheless.) These films allowed established and beloved Disney stars to bring their acting chops to new characters and stories, which was always like an exciting thought experiment. (What if Lizzy McGuire went to military camp? What if Chad Danforth got really into double dutch?)
For a young Disney Channel devotee like myself, there was something inexplicably special about knowing that millions of others were tuning in for each new 8/7 Central DCOM premiere — and that we were all, at the same time, under the same sky, wondering what exactly “8/7 Central” meant. Looking back, I understand that the true magic of the era was found not in the films themselves, but in the communal spirit of excitement and joy they managed to cultivate. “The Suite Life Movie” was nothing short of a national event. Forget “Avengers: Infinity War” – Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato’s collaboration in “Princess Protection Program” was the actual most ambitious crossover event in history. “16 Candles” was not just a fantasy-comedy, but an inspired foray into psychological horror. And the release of dance-along editions for each “High School Musical” film cannot be described as anything other than fundamentally game-changing (the first few counts of the “We’re All in This Together” choreography have never left my muscle memory.) Even the DCOMs that came before my time made their impressions on me in one way or another: reruns of “The Luck of the Irish” and “The Thirteenth Year” fueled my hopes — and fears — that I too could be part leprechaun or mermaid and just didn’t know it yet.
But, in my opinion, there is one DCOM that stands far apart from the rest. The 2011 film “Lemonade Mouth” is truly the crown jewel of the Disney Channel Renaissance, and a veritable cinematic achievement in its own right. “Lemonade Mouth” epitomizes, at least for me, everything that good children’s media should have: complex characters, important messaging, and a soundtrack of 10 verifiable pop-rock bops.
“Lemonade Mouth” tells the story of five high school students who meet a-la-“Breakfast Club” and decide to form a band after they spontaneously perform an impromptu musical number in perfect synchronization during detention. In many ways, “Lemonade Mouth” is a monumental work because it remedies the shortcomings and missteps of its predecessors. It hits the emotional beats that other musical DCOMs sometimes missed, and captures the spirit of revolution in a way no subsequent film could. In all seriousness, “Lemonade Mouth’s” exploration of friendship, advocacy, and self-acceptance is strangely insightful for a children’s musical drama. The film provides a strikingly real look at the insecurities, imperfections, and inner worlds of each of its characters; it does ensemble cast right, allowing each of its main characters to be a multi-dimensional individual (can “High School Musical” say the same?) Before “Radio Rebel,” “Lemonade Mouth” — the original ode to misfits and outsiders — artfully showed how music can be a tool of resistance (see “Breakthrough” and “Here We Go”). And hearing “She’s So Gone” for the first time at age 10 surely did something irreversible to my brain. More than any other DCOM, I returned to “Lemonade Mouth” again and again over the years, memorizing the entirety of the “Determinate” rap (which I still know to this day) in the process.
Needless to say, I was thrilled when the launch of Disney+ allowed me to access all of the DCOMs once again, 10+ years after their original releases. Revisiting childhood favorites is always risky business, but I am pleased to report that “Lemonade Mouth” is still a masterpiece. It always has been, and it always will be. Maybe a return to the artistic genius of the Disney Channel Renaissance is exactly what we need in these trying times. Everybody could use a reminder to turn the world into their dance floor. Determinate, determinate.
—Incoming TV Executive Jamila O’Hara staunchly believes that “High School Musical 2” is way better than “High School Musical.” She is honestly not sure how controversial of an opinion this is, but she is open to hearing other perspectives — she can be reached at @jamila.o'hara@thecrimson.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Drakeo the Ruler, whose signature laid-back flow and unapologetic charisma helped to define modern West Coast rap, was killed last weekend in Los Angeles. The rapper, 28, passed on Sunday morning, Dec. 19, after suffering stabbing injuries during an appearance at the Once Upon A Time in LA Festival hosted at Exposition Park.
This news was tragic. Drakeo is my favorite rapper from LA. I listen to him everyday. Growing up in LA, I became a huge fan of his while in high school. As an independent artist, Drakeo could do and say what he wanted. My friends and I found his effortless ability to flow over beats and his almost-flippant level of self-confidence absolutely magnetic.
A couple weeks ago, I was talking with one of those friends from high school about explaining LA rap to people from other cities. He said that he always plays anything by Drakeo.
A big part of my respect and fandom for Drakeo revolved around his legal battle with former Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey. In 2019, the rapper was acquitted of a murder that he did not commit in a case that originated from a 2016 shooting.
Although Drakeo was exonerated of all wrongdoing, former DA Lacey refiled the case to keep the rapper locked up for another full year on the same charges on which he had just been found not guilty.
Seemingly out of a desire to make an example of Drakeo, Lacey tried to officially categorize Drakeo’s rap group, the Stinc Team, as a criminal gang. She also attempted to cite the rapper’s lyrics as evidence against him in court.
To supporters of Drakeo, the behavior of Lacey and the LAPD demonstrated clear racial prejudice against the rapper. Despite the appalling mistreatment he was facing, Drakeo’s resolve remained unphased. The rapper dropped a critically-acclaimed mixtape in 2020, “Thank You for Using GTL,” recorded and released from behind bars.
#FREEDRAKEO became a popular mantra and statement of support among fans of the rapper and fellow LA artists. Drakeo released the “Free Drakeo” loosie mixtape in 2020.
When Lacey lost reelection in November 2020, Drakeo was finally freed after spending three years in custody. One day after Lacey’s removal from office, following a single day of trial, a plea deal was brokered and the rapper was free. LA music journalist Jeff Weiss, whose coverage of Drakeo’s case brought injustices suffered by the rapper to light, tweeted that Lacey’s replacement was essential to reaching a deal.
2021 was the hottest year of Drakeo’s career to date and a triumphant return from his legal battle. He released four full length projects, garnered an illusive Drake feature, and reached fans in new cities.
Last November, I wrote about my Top 5 Drakeo songs in celebration of his release from prison. Here is an updated, unranked list of my favorite Drakeo songs in honor of the late West Coast legend. Rest in Peace. Long Live The Greatest.
“Touchable (Freestyle)” (2021)
This is the 25th of 29 tracks on Drakeo’s most recent tape “So Cold I Do Em 2.” The song is one of the many examples of the rapper’s ability to maintain a high level of quality among the mass quantity of his discography. The “Touchable” beat originally appeared on the single of the same name by LA artist Remble, who Drakeo signed to the Stinc Team this year. Remble’s viral success on TikTok speaks to Drakeo’s keen eye for talent and his position as an architect of the LA rap genre.
“Talk to Me [feat. Drake]” (2021)
An independent rapper landing a Drake feature is almost unheard of, unless you are Drakeo the Ruler. This anti-love love song gave Drakeo his first major radio play and showcases his massive pop crossover appeal. A few months ago, Drake announced Drakeo as the LA representative of his OVO clothing collaboration with the NBA. The track is one of the many stops on Drakeo the Ruler’s 2021 victory lap.
“Fights Don’t Matter” (2020)
“Fights Don’t Matter” was the first single that Drakeo dropped after being released from prison and appears on his 2020 comeback album “We Know the Truth.” It speaks to the unapologetic self-confidence that got him noticed and his unique ear for locating the pocket on beats. The single dropped with a music video that was one of Drakeo’s first public appearances after his release. After being gone for almost three years, it was incredibly powerful to see him return to rap.
“Pow Right in the Kisser [feat. Ketchy the Great, Remble, MoneyMonk & Ralfy the Plug]” (2021)
On this posse track, Drakeo repeats the song’s namesake chorus “Pow Right in the Kisser” every other bar, for over five minutes, but it somehow works. The song is a testament to Drakeo’s expert ear for lyrical delivery. Even when he is rapping the same line over and over, it still sounds amazing. Features include Remble, MoneyMonk, Drakeo’s brother Ralfy the Plug, and the late Stinc Team member Ketchy the Great who passed on in February due to a traffic accident. The track is a time capsule of LA rap and a snapshot of Drakeo at his peak.
—RIP Drakeo. Staff writer Ryan S. Kim can be reached at ryan.kim@thecrimson.com.

Let’s be honest: Harvard can be brutal. Even when it gets less so, people can’t sit with the reality of doing less, so they scramble back to the arena, guns blazing (or more like laptops and email accounts and LinkedIns out.)
Sometimes the adrenaline and achievement are worth it. You turn in the paper, crush the presentation, get the internship. You excel at said internship, get into law school, attend said law school, make the law review, land a job at a New York firm, sign a long-term lease in TriBeCa, make partner before 40 … but I digress. Because yes, the fervor of collegiate aspiration can be thrilling. But at other times, it can feel like everything is turning against you. And it’s never just one thing — it’s everything at once, in an uncanny convergence of bad.
What do you do when that happens? Succumb to misery and throw in the towel? Uh, yeah, no. You do what Harvardians do best. You pretend.
It’s improbable anyone needs help completing the A.B. (with honors, mind you) that Harvard undergraduates receive before departing Cambridge, regardless of their actual concentration: the Bachelor of Arts in Pretending to Be Okay. But just in case you need the extra boost as your world unravels, here’s a list of shows that’ll put you on a power trip. Not that you need another one.
“Game of Thrones”
You won’t see dragons gliding over Lamont or Dothraki charging across the Yard. Yet the strategic machinations and existential hunger for power that define Westeros’ top contenders for the Iron Throne hit a little too close to home. Above all else, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss’ tour de force is a harrowing study in the distortive nature of ambition. Oh, and by the way — if you think you’re a Lannister, you’re not a Lannister.
“Succession”
The classy, haunting theme song. Brian Cox’s cathartic delivery of expletives. Romulus (insert aforementioned expletive) Roy. Corporate meetings that smell like war campaigns. “Well, Kim Jong Pop, because that’s not how things work in this country.” I rest my case.
“Industry”
If someone told me the protagonists of “Industry” were recruited from the Cabot Science Library, I’d believe them. This HBO drama series deftly encapsulates the acumen, materialistic ambition, and insecurity that define the quintessential Harvard finance hopeful. In the show’s high-strung corporate office, it’s not a question of whether you can get the job done — you’ll get it done because you have to. The most striking feature of “Industry” is the way it brutally exposes the vapid materialism and crippling anxiety that define the finance lifestyle, only to play the reverse card. Because even after going through absolute hell, you get the bonus, or sign the lease, or make the cut. And just like that, everything’s worth it again.
“Elite”
Welcome to another unrealistic show about teenagers where the houses are too big, the parties too lavish, and the high schoolers look like they’re in their mid-twenties. In this hit Spanish drama, everything is excessive — the wealth, the plot, the sex. Despite its exaggerated depictions of glamorous living, “Elite” succeeds in weaving a dense tale of desire and intrigue that features what just might be the most unbecoming clique of all: ultra-privileged kids who think they’re going through it.
“Attack on Titan”
There’s one character in this anime who is a power trip, and his name is Levi Ackerman. Watching him in combat is the paragon of catharsis. Also, he’s attractive. Like, really attractive. So give it a watch, if just for the dark prince of the Survey Corps.
“Alice in Borderland” 
From a cursory 4 a.m. Netflix scroll, yes, the thumbnail for this show makes it look like a grossly underfinanced live-action adaptation. Based on the manga of the same name, “Alice in Borderland” follows a group of civilians who find themselves transported to a parallel Tokyo where they have to enter deadly games to add extra days to their “visas.” Why can’t they just refuse to play? If your visa expires, a laser shoots down from the sky and impales your head. Through his dazzling depictions of an apocalyptic Tokyo, Japanese director Shinsuke Sato injects vitality into the classic trope of crisis illuminating the best and worst in ordinary people.
“Narcos”
It seems apt to end with the best. In this surreal world of big money and even bigger dreams, one man acts on his vision to build an empire. Despite its questionable penchant for glamorizing violence, “Narcos” endures as one of the most chilling and artful depictions of a historical villain in recent television. Pablo Escobar’s nail-biting showdowns with the Colombian government are hard to forget. The show’s cohesive aesthetic of excess — think imported cars, hippopotami smuggled into Escobar’s blue-green fields, and giant boxes of cash buried under mansions — also merits praise. However, the singular achievement of “Narcos” is its at turns harrowing, at other turns tender depiction of a murderer who plays God.
So there you have it — a list of shows to remind you what you’ve known in your heart of hearts all along: The show doesn’t run you. You run it.
Have fun, Harvardians. Because in retrospect, even the bad days were good.

To write this piece, I know I must tread lightly. I have once tried my chances, taken a major risk, and unfortunately fallen victim to the wrath of angry stans on Twitter, and I have since learned my lesson. Almost a year ago today, I attempted to defend a friend who (intentionally and admittedly very stupidly) poked fun at an artist who has, what we quickly learned, a very devoted fanbase. For no less than 24 hours after my friend’s initial tweet, I found my own Twitter mentions full of unnamed people hiding behind avatars of their favorite artist calling me the most creative insults I have ever seen, let alone been called. Who knew that 280 characters could be harnessed so maliciously?
A year later, I have finally recovered. I now know better than to critique an artist on Twitter for fear of their stans coming back to mentions. And if any of my friends decide to play with fire again? Well, it’s every man for himself.
Who better to rank the top five scariest Twitter stans than me, someone who has once been targeted by Twitter stans and who may be considered by others to be a member of one of the following stanbases. With that, I present to you: Twitter’s Top Five Scariest Stanbases.
[Disclaimer: If you see a fanbase listed here of which you are a member, know that I mean no harm. I do not wish to disparage you or the artist you stan. On the contrary, this is a tribute, the highest compliment, that I can offer up. Because of your work on Twitter, I will never insult your favs, no matter how problematic they may be.]
Little Monsters
Little Monsters, the fans of pop legend Lady Gaga, are exactly that: little monsters. Unafraid to be freaky, just like their savior, often referred to as “Lady Godga,” the Little Monsters will go to the ends of the earth (Italy) to defend their beloved Mother Monster. There could be 100 tweets on your timeline, and 99 of them don’t scare you, but one does — and it’s probably a Little Monster.
Beyhive
The phrase “hive mind” truly takes on new meaning when it comes to the devout followers of Queen Bey. I fear for the safety of anyone who takes to Twitter to spew the lie that Beyoncé cannot sing. Before they could even blink, Beyoncé naysayers will feel the sting of a thousand Ivy Park-clad bees (beys?) going apeshit. Even the smallest speculation about the queen will get the Beyhive buzzing and Beyoncé trending number one on Twitter. It makes sense though, you don’t get to be the number one most awarded vocalist in Grammy history without building a strong hive.
Swifties
The Swifties are indeed swift. If the FBI were to staff only Swifties, all of America’s most wanted would quickly turn into America’s immediately found. Within minutes of Taylor Swift posting to social media, Swifties are quick to turn in Sherlock Holmes and look for any hidden clues pointing to when their fav is going to drop her next rerelease. If I were Jake Gyllenhaal, I’d go into hiding, but even witness protection wouldn’t be able to stave off the Swifties.
ARMY
ARMY is an apt name for K-pop supergroup BTS’s combative fan base. Although every viral tweet may be different, one is guaranteed to find two things in the replies of each one: a sponsored ad for a TikTok galaxy light, and a BTS fancam with more views than seems possible. Not only will ARMY members fight each other over who’s the best member of BTS as well as other stanbases over why BTS is the best musical act to ever exist, but ARMY will also fight the system. When ARMY members booked all the tickets to a rally held by Donald Trump during the 2020 elections, leading to an empty arena, they proved that they were more powerful than dynamite.
Honorable Mentions
And before I go to our number one most scary stanbase, here are some honorable mentions:
The Bardigang, Cardi B’s following, is one of the few fanbases brave enough to go bat to bat with the number one most scary fanbase, and for that I commend them. I also fear them.
Arianators, much like Army, have a fancam for everything, with footage even going back to Ariana Grande’s “Victorious” days. With the support of the Arianators, it is miraculous that Team Ariana didn’t win on this season of “The Voice.”
The Lana Cult, the self-assigned name of Lana Del Rey’s stans, is our last honorable mention. I would’ve made the Lana Cult the number one scariest Twitter stanbase, but I admit I’m biased — after all, a year ago they did attack me for hours.
So — without further ado, I present to you, Twitter’s scariest stanbase.
Barbz
As the ancient proverb goes, hell hath no fury like a Barb scorned. Over the last decade, no group of stans has proven to be more terrifyingly loyal as the Barbz, the self-described queen of rap Nicki Minaj’s stans. There are no words to describe the way the Barbz are able to mobilize and attack other than outright terrifying — and also impressive. No fans will go to the lengths to defend their favorite artists the same way Barbz defended an allegedly unvaccinated Nicki and her cousin’s friend with the swollen testicles. Unbothered, unashamed, and unvaccinated, Barbz are the spiders of Twitter — are never more than three feet (or tweets) away from one. And much like you don’t want to mess with a venomous spider, you don’t want to cross a Barb, lest you want to feel the wrath of Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinski, Nicki the Ninja, Nicki the Boss, Nicki the Harajuku Barbie.
To all the stanbases who have been mentioned here today, wear your designation as one of Twitter’s scariest as a badge of honor. Go forth and know that you, your Twitter fingers, and your undying loyalty to a celebrity who will probably never know you exist, have defended your fav from the indignity of constructive criticism.
— Despite spending every waking moment on the bird app, outgoing co-music executive and self-described Little Monster Annie Harrigan has never had a viral tweet. You can reach Annie on Twitter @AnnieAHarrigan where she will continue to share her music reviews since she can’t do it for The Crimson anymore.

“We're all unlucky sometimes. When I am, I go jogging. The body loses water when you jog, so you have none left for tears.” —Wong Kar-wai
As I gaze across the grey Massachusetts horizon from a cavernous dungeon-dorm-hybrid that can only be described as “New Quincy,” the reality of this pandemic now rings truer than ever. I can’t even jog outside to push away the tears, because I’m convinced that the New England weather will turn my tear ducts into giant frost-bitten icicles. I’m afraid that in this dire era, even my favorite pastime — roasting chestnuts (i.e. compers) over an open fire — can’t bring me happiness.
It was in this dark, dark hour that I remembered one of my AFVS classes left me with a Criterion Channel subscription through the end of the month. All of a sudden, the clouds parted, the Sun peaked out, and heaven itself started singing. This is all metaphorical of course — you can’t get good Massachusetts weather in December!
So without further ado, here are some great movies (in no particular order) about loneliness and isolation to brighten up your holiday spirit. How fun!
“In the Mood for Love” (2000), dir. Wong Kar-wai
The namesake of this vanity piece, and a film directed by my idol himself (check the suit-and-shades look), “In the Mood for Love” is a gorgeous story with powerful emotions that just creep up on you. At its core, the film follows two people who struggle to find happiness: always looking for it in the wrong place or at the wrong time. Wong plays with time to hallucinatory effect, dialing down the frame rate to make his protagonists feel stuck — crawling against time to fight for what was always going to be an impossible outcome anyway.
“First Man” (2018), dir. Damien S. Chazelle ‘07
Harvard alumnus Damien Chazelle’s Neil Armstrong biopic is about someone who doesn’t know how or where to find catharsis. It’s about going through the most painful experience possible, and only knowing how to plug that gaping emotional hole with more work. Yup, sounds like Harvard to me. In all seriousness, “First Man” features one of the most realistic depictions of what it feels like to be isolated after losing a loved one. It also features a thoroughly moving original score by Justin Hurwitz ‘08, with standout excerpts like “Quarantine” being played on a theremin — with haunting results.
“The Irishman” (2019), dir. Martin Scorsese
And of course, I had to end this vanity on a Scorsese film. “The Irishman” is an exploration of guilt — on what it means to sin and repent, but somehow still feel empty. Many of the character conflicts here are built on a breakdown of open communication — a gangster-film-trope that’s heightened to comic proportions in “The Irishman.” Being mistrustful of your friends, and isolating your family, only leaves you alone at the end of your life, reminiscing on experiences that no one else can remember, and revisiting memories that no one else can share with you.
In my two years as film executive, a few compers have asked me why I love films so much, given that “you get more character development” in TV shows anyway. Obviously, I’m by no means qualified to speak on behalf of all films, but as the designated film-nerd at the Crimson, I always felt compelled to say that there’s something special and unique about films.
I recently stumbled on an interview between Scorsese and Wong, and at one point Scorsese said, “Let me say [this] about Wong Kar-wai films — it’s something that can only be a film.” All films tell stories. But the best films are always more of an experience. Someone can turn the MCU into a TV show and no one would bat an eye. But you can’t serialize “In the Mood for Love” — even if you tried. You can’t serialize “First Man.” These aren’t films that are concerned with feeding audiences “what comes next.” They’re concerned about building atmosphere and mood, about leaving their audiences feeling something subtle, searing, and profound.
My biggest goal as film executive has always been to nudge writers into loving film, and helping them find new films to love. Nothing has touched me more than having a writer or exec say that I’ve changed how they view films. Or compers who tell me that they’ve found their favorite films through my pitches. These are moments I will cherish indelibly. As I age into dino-territory, my only hope moving forward is that all film executives down the line keep Crimson Arts in the mood for films.
—Lanz Aaron G. Tan is a very tired, but very fulfilled outgoing film executive. He will miss getting quoted in closeouts, making attempts to annex TV and music into film, and most of all, being a part of the arts community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For months, I have tried to fight the rumors. “Joy hasn’t listened to a single straight male artist in the last year.” “Joy only watched ‘Breaking Bad’ because she heard there was a gay character.” I have tried to defend myself, to remind skeptics that I think there was a Philip Glass song in my Spotify Wrapped somewhere, and I’m pretty sure he’s not gay — all to no avail. Hell, I even sat down the other day and watched an entire movie without a single gay character, and I actually enjoyed it!
But life is too short to live a lie, so I have decided to come clean: There have been points in my life where I have indulged in some bad queer art. Sometimes, at the end of a long day, I just want to cradle the $3 lesbian flag that I got from some horrifying Target pride sale and watch a movie with a couple of fellow queers, no matter how cringe-worthy the dialogue or painfully-autoned the vocals. Of course, don’t get me wrong: I love good gay art too (check out our Best Of lists for some prime examples). But there are still few queer creators who break into the industry, and sometimes the ones who do are… simply not that good. But you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.
So, for any of my fellow alphabet mafia members out there, here’s a guide to the best bad queer art to turn to when you’ve finished every indie lesbian movie and Mae Martin standup clip and are ready to lower your standards.
5. “Coconuts”, the Kim Petras single
Does this seminal single by groundbreaking trans artist Kim Petras have “artistic merit” or “good lyrics?” Very much no. Does the song at any point go beyond the repetition of “my coconuts,” “coconuts” here being a reference to Petras’s boobs? Also no. But give it a listen or two, and Petras’s defiant celebration of a surgery some politicians are still demonizing will probably end up stuck in your head whether you want it to or not. And hey, if you’ve had a couple drinks, you might even be able to convince yourself it’s a banger.
4. “Single All the Way”, the Netflix Christmas Special
Now, I’m not going to lie to you about this one: this is a legitimately terrible movie. If you liked Jennifer Coolidge in “The White Lotus” or “Legally Blonde,” prepare to be profoundly disappointed. If you came here for an ounce of good acting, brace yourself for a lead who looks like he can’t remember his line (or what a genuine emotion looks like) and is suffering from mild constipation for the entire movie. But no one does campy Christmas quite like the gays — in the eloquent words of Coolidge’s character, ”the gays just know how to do stuff” — and if you’re not rooting for the show’s leads to get together at the end, you’re probably either our hard-to-please graduating film exec or a soulless husk.
3. “Love, Victor”, the Hulu TV show
Three years ago, Greg Berlanti directed the thoroughly-mediocre film adaptation of “Simon and the Homo Sapiens Agenda,” in which straight lead actor Nick Robinson played a rich, white, “totally normal” protagonist who reassured viewers he was “not that gay.” Shortly thereafter, Hulu graced us with a slightly-less-mediocre follow-up TV series, an often-sappy, High School Musical-esque high school drama with an occasional moment of real heart. Parts of the show are certainly cringeworthy, and a handful of characters are generously allowed only one (1) single personality trait. But, particularly in its second season, “Love, Victor” dares to push the envelope a bit (at least enough to get the show taken off of Disney+), and if you’re in need of a little feel-good teen romance, it’s honestly not a bad option.
2. “Glee”, the… do I really need to explain this one?
Let’s be real — there’s a lot to hate about Glee. You’ve seen the “Will Schuester” trigger warnings. You’ve seen the rendition of “Gold Digger” that ought to be doomed to the ether forever, and the excellent thinkpieces about the ways the show’s attempts at representation often failed or were laced with problems. This is not to say that “Glee” deserves to be forgiven for its sins, or that a show gets a free pass for being problematic because it was “the first” to do something. But I do think that there is value in looking back at our history and understanding what kind of path “Glee” paved for queer representation, good and bad. And looking back, there are moments on this bonkers, sappy show that I will never forget — moments when I saw young gay kids get to belong and be in love and joyful and successful that I really needed. At the end of the day, part of “Glee”’s appeal is an indictment of the landscape of modern television: for all its flaws, hardly any shows since have been willing to explore and bring hope to the darker parts of being gay in high school like “Glee” did.
1. “Are You The One?”, Season 8
When it comes to reality TV, the queer content is either “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” “Coming Out Colton,” or nonexistent. (Oh, and there was also that show with the straight woman who had to guess which of her pretending-to-be-straight suitors was gay, I guess?) In a field of mostly-unappealing candidates, the eighth season of the matchmaking reality show “Are You The One,” in which all of the contestants are pansexual, is… honestly pretty solid. Have you ever wondered what would happen if everyone on a reality show could, theoretically, fuck each other? (And let’s be clear, on “Are You The One,” it’s not theoretical.) If you guessed the result would be utter chaos, you were correct. But for all of the contestants’ bikini-clad catfights and total inability to communicate, there’s something meaningful about how “Are You the One?” gives us transmasculine fuckboys and ridiculous love triangles in which queerness is such a total non-issue. For so long, queer relationships have had to project this perfect, healthy image just to exist. Disastrous as “Are You The One” may get, It’s kind of a relief that we’re at a point in our society where we can finally admit that queer relationships are oftentimes just as messy and chaotic as straight ones.
—Outgoing Arts Chair Joy C. Ashford first trumpeted her gayness to the Internet in a Crimson article about Hayley Kiyoko, and allegedly has not shut up about her alphabet mafia membership ever since. She will forever be grateful to the gay icons on Crimson Arts who first introduced her to the wonders of lesbianism, the token straight men who put up with her constant commentary on “Happiest Season,” and, of course, her beloved work husband. To send her a piece of media that is even vaguely queer (artistic merit not required), please email joy.ashford@thecrimson.com.

No indie 2000s playlist would be complete without a sampling from the extensive canon of Sufjan Stevens’ work — from the 22-track eccentric folk of “Illinois” to the matured and delicately emotional “Carrie & Lowell,” culminating in his 2017 appearances on the “Call Me By Your Name” soundtrack.
To top such an iconic breadth of work is no easy expectation. Following “Mystery of Love” and “Visions of Gideon,” Stevens released a flood of music, both collaborative and solo, that delved into electronic instrumentations more than before but lacked the profound impact of his past works. His most recent release, “A Beginner’s Mind,” is a collaborative album with Angelo de Augustine, the rising California-based indie artist who has released three albums since 2014. De Augustine’s and Stevens’ styles feel akin to each other — mostly dominated by carefully plucked guitar strings and whispering vocals — yet De Augustine distinguishes himself by cherishing the playfulness of pop melodies with a fresh yet mature tone of lightness.
The result is an album that beautifully complements each artist’s past monumental works while pushing both to a previously unexplored sound featuring electric guitar, fuller production, and dynamic song structures.
The album opens with the careful acoustic build up of “Reach Out,” which previews much of the album’s characteristics: Musically, it swings from the artists’ iconic minimal production to a sparkling crescendo that mirrors the album’s sonic contrast both across and within tracks. Conceptually, it lays the lyrical foundation for the album as it turns to past generations for help with life’s slow, unjust torment. As he sings, “I would rather be devoured than be broken,” Stevens succinctly echoes the album’s overwhelming fear of having to be patient through pain.
Lyrically, the album draws upon the premises of the artists’ favorite movies. The songs are not merely replicas of the films’ plots, though: “We wanted to make them our own, appropriate them, and then come up with new narratives and new characters and new perspectives,” Stevens said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.
The movie references provide a familiar touchstone for the album, which aren’t disjointed due to the common themes tied throughout — “Pillar of Souls” builds off of the morbidity of “Reach Out,” which continues in “Murder and Crime.”
The majority of tracks are effective in that way — utilizing the movie-framework to craftily tell new narratives with the enigmatic, poetic lyrics of which Stevens and De Augustine are both experienced. Not all tracks achieve this, though, awkwardly sticking out from the rest of the album. “Fictional California” is a clear model of this, with a chorus reliant on painfully cliché symbolism (“Open the light to the darkness”) that makes it difficult to listen earnestly.
Lyrics aside, “A Beginner’s Mind” is in many ways a sonic feat. “Pillar of Souls” is an unmistakable highlight of the album, where eerie repetitive pianos are supplemented with shimmering production that smash into the chorus’s dark, production-heavy chant; the subtle yet pivotal guitar outro that unravels is an unpredictable and satisfying conclusion. Both artists’ hushed vocal deliveries seamlessly thrive in the unusual context of increased production — the perfect balance of experimentation and familiarity. “You Give Death a Bad Name” succeeds in the same light — the Stevens-De Augustine acoustic guitar staple is built upon with sharp electric guitars and forefronted percussion that drop out three-fourths of the way through for salient distorted vocals and synths. This is an example of experimentation done thoughtfully and genuinely.
Stevens and De Augustine deliver on their quintessential gentle acoustic tracks as well. “Murder and Crime” rings of the triumphs in “Mystery of Love” and “Visions of Gideon” — while unlikely to have the same worldwide reception, the song’s melody is no less magnificent: The swinging chorus slowly descends into a piano instrumental accompanied by melodic sighs that roll in like fog. Compared to other tracks, the minimal production is essential, as it allows the brilliance of the chorus to breathe on its own. The title track accomplishes the same effort, offering a necessary break from the first few production-heavy tracks that introduce the album.
Some tracks are deficient in the wonder of both the experimental and the simple tracks, though — falling somewhere in between. “It’s Your Own Body and Mind” and “Olympus” lack the venturesome production of other tracks on the album that both surprise and deliver, yet also lack the depth of melody to carry such simplicity and repetition in execution. The resulting tracks pass by slowly; the recipe of experimentation and familiarity in composition does not always satisfy the thirst for compelling music.
“A Beginner’s Mind” showcases that the experimental risk is worth the shocking reward, even if the cost is an inconsistency in the cohesive quality of the record. Although created by a pairing of a veteran musician and a budding artist, both Stevens and De Augustine assume a beginner’s mind — approaching the record with wide eyes for new possibilities, propagating promising new horizons for the futures of both artists’ work.

As I walk the brick sidewalks of Cambridge on a particularly windy 5:00 p.m. evening, I’m reminded of the mildly infuriating inconvenience that is Daylight Savings Time and the fact that the weather in New Zealand, on the opposite side of the world, is much more temperate right now. Thus, while I take the timeliness of Lorde’s “Solar Power (Deluxe Edition)” release to be rather boastful towards listeners in the Western Hemisphere like myself, the album brought me back to a time when all we had to worry about was wearing SPF and what it meant to have a hot girl summer.
The deluxe edition of “Solar Power,” Lorde’s third studio album, includes two bonus tracks, “Helen of Troy” and “Hold No Grudge.” Although both songs only tangentially flow with Lorde’s newfound Woodstock-y, psychedelic indie vibe — Lorde herself said in her newsletter that the “songs were fun explorations on the album journey” that “didn’t quite fit into the tracklist” — what remains is the album’s overall message of growing up and becoming your own person.
“Helen of Troy” reinterprets the ancient myth of the Trojan War and the implications of Helen’s actions. Lorde doesn’t vilify her as much of history did; rather, she reinterprets her as the kind of woman who makes heads turn in the music industry and in popular culture: “They could be drinking with you, but they'll be looking at me / This whole time, I've been playing it coy / The city’s falling for me just like I’m Helen of Troy.”
Lorde sings the chorus with high, breathy vocals, as if she’s a choir of angels giving us reassurement that things will get better: “So when you're broke, can't get ahead / Or when you take it out on your boyfriend / I know it's hard, but do your best / Give yourself a break, have a little faith.” The instrumentals in “Helen of Troy” revolve around a repeating guitar sequence, making for a catchy beat and memorable tune.
As someone who’s been under the spotlight since the age of 16, Lorde is no stranger to critical public opinions on her music and persona. As she sings of her experiences working in the music industry — one minute she’s “killing ‘em all” and the next she’s not being allowed to perform — she nonetheless speaks to something we can all relate to in our own lives. We all have our highs and lows; we’re being appreciated at one moment and not the next. It’s easy to rewrite the choruses to fit your own situation, and Lorde reminds us that it’s hard being a girl living in a modern world and we deserve some respect, damn it.
In the second new track “Hold No Grudge,” Lorde’s lyrics reflect moments in Lorde’s past relationships, reminiscent of the personal, detail-filled verses in Pure Heroine’s “No Better” and Melodrama’s “The Louvre.” In a newsletter to fans, Lorde wrote, “Every couple lines, the person I’m singing about changes; one minute it’s a childhood friend, next a crush or a colleague.”
In an album that diverges sharply from Lorde’s previous discography, “Hold No Grudge” is almost a reflection on Lorde’s past self. Once scared of getting old, the 25-year old now embraces growing up and the lessons learned along the way: “Acting my age, not my horoscope / guess that’s growing up.”
Similar to “Helen of Troy,” “Hold No Grudge” features pre-chorus instrumentals consisting of a repeating guitar sequence. There’s also interesting percussion, with what sounds like a guiro adding an electronic (and perhaps reptilian) sound. This transitions to a more “Solar Power”-esque, chill sound in the chorus, where Lorde sings at a lower pitch and slower beat. As she closes this song and the album itself, Lorde sings of “sending you love / And wishing you well / Wherever you are” with high, calming vocals, concluding “Solar Power (Deluxe Edition)” on an optimistic note.
“Solar Power” has not been widely received as sonically or emotionally superior to her previous two albums, but that might just be because so many of us are stuck in the past and can’t get over the 2013 Tumblr-aesthetic era. Nevertheless, the two bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of “Solar Power” are just the vibes we need as we wrap up 2021. As Lorde sings in “Hold No Grudge,” “Yeah, I know that some shit was said and done / But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone” — an acknowledgment that all of us have changed, and that change is good.

On Nov. 18, NIKI released the new single “Split,” a musical memoir in collaboration with Jacob Ray and Bekon & The Donuts that reflects on her dual cultural identity and the feeling of being torn between two worlds. The 22-year-old singer-songwriter, producer, and 88rising artist who calls Indonesia and America home captures widely-shared emotions that arise from identifying with two different cultures in intimate and heartfelt lyrics. “Split” is the latest addition to 88rising’s highly anticipated Head In The Clouds 3 collaborative album, joining the list of Warren Hue, Rich Brian, Ylona Garcia, and BIBI.
The song is prefaced by bass pizzicato and slow drum beat, a soft mix of jazzy waltz and R&B. NIKI's ethereal half-voice enters, resonant and quiet-spoken with a strong scent of nostalgia. At the same time, little moments of breath or vocal fry make her lyrics feel all the more genuine and intimate. NIKI’s voice often melts into a falsetto, almost like a sigh. The corresponding music video scene of a car running into the fading sunset perfectly captures that singular sound.
In the chorus, NIKI enunciates each syllable of the lyrics in a dreamy arpeggio. However, the ascension of the melody never reaches a full climax — she leaves her high note mid-sentence and drops back to her original register, a highly controlled and realistic turn of musical events. The detached articulation almost sounds as if NIKI is giving herself instructions to keep herself grounded amidst the disorienting reality, moving through life as though through a series of stepping stones: “Right foot rock, left foot hard place, head and heart at war," she sings.
All in all, “Split” is a work of collective memory. Earlier, NIKI reached out to her fans to share photos and videos that represent the two worlds they feel split between. She compiled and overlaid the media she received into a montage, featuring clips of hummingbirds, tropical scenes, and loved ones. Her own representations of her split world include an empty house, a performer’s spotlight, and two social tables.
The loneliness and ambivalence that she feels from engaging with two different cultures are also reflected in the dichotomy between her personal and professional life, between living alone and family-filled childhood photos, and even the perceived weather. For example, NIKI juxtaposes the implied coldness of winter against the perceived heat of the West Coast, where she currently bases her artistic work. There is a disjoint between where she is physically and where she is at heart — the house she lives in isn’t necessarily her home, which exists elsewhere and is somewhere that she misses. The extravagance of living as a performing artist in Los Angeles simply does not replace the warmth of family and home.
The song ends after a second round of chorus, when NIKI comes to an abrupt staccato, conveying an ambivalent mix of resoluteness and resignation. “Always part of me missing / But no one sees the difference / 'Cause I split them all,” she sings, her bare voice hanging in the air organically and poignantly without any accompaniment or fade-outs. There is no reaffirmation or complete closure to her narrative — it’s still a work in progress, no promises attached.
Originally, “Split” was written for her last studio album, Moonchild. “But I took it off because it felt way too personal and special and needed its own life,” NIKI shared on social media. “I wrote it about forever having to split myself between Indo, LA, and feeling like i have to constantly ‘split the difference’ or adapt/assimilate all the time. It’s a song about home, identity or maybe the struggle to find either.” With the upcoming holiday season, “Split” is not only NIKI’s memoir but also a warm reminder for the listeners to reflect on and renew their appreciation for “home.”

Teenage heartbreak fuels the emotional tour de force that is Olivia Rodrigo’s debut LP “SOUR,” which dissects a relationship’s aftermath with incisive pop-punk precision. The singer-songwriter and Disney star told Variety that the record delves into her “deepest, darkest secrets and insecurities,” and her refusal to sugarcoat her feelings takes the resulting music from palatable to near-perfect.
Almost a year since the hit single “drivers license” revved up her solo career, Rodrigo couldn’t have chosen a better venue for her Dec. 7 NPR Tiny Desk (home) concert than a vacant DMV office, whose “interesting vibes” she noted during her set of four songs from “SOUR.” The best vibes around, though, came from her heartfelt performance.
The band’s opening arrangement of “good 4 u” traded the sinister growl of the original’s staccato bass line for five acoustic guitars, with occasional knocks on the soundboard as the only percussion. The instrumentals framed Rodrigo’s voice in a plaintive resonance that sharpened the lyrics’ caustic sting. “Good for you / You look happy and healthy, not me / If you ever cared to ask,” she began the first chorus over subtly syncopated strums. Halfway through the bridge, the upper-register chords took on greater rhythmic definition, intensifying toward the finale’s visceral near-scream of “Like a damn sociopath.”
Rodrigo then introduced her current “favorite song on the album:” the ballad “traitor,” a bitter lament for disloyalty. “It took you two weeks to go off and date her / Guess you didn’t cheat, but you’re still a traitor,” she sang. The number of guitars in use dropped from five to two — one for each week before the titular ex moved on to someone new, maybe?
Once the last chord had faded, Rodrigo set aside her Gibson for a shoutout to her backing band and a keyboard-only rendition of “drivers license.” The lack of other accompaniment made the song’s defining pedal point sound more insistent than ever, as if reflecting Rodrigo’s refusal to accept “how you could be so okay now that I’m gone.” When she conveyed the shock of realizing that “you didn’t mean what you wrote in that song about me,” there was no denying how deeply she meant every word.
As Rodrigo shared song after song about love gone, well, sour, her many perspectives on the subject ensured that “deja vu” never set in — not even on the track of the same name that concluded her set. She took relentlessly ironic aim at her uncanny similarities to an ex’s new partner, sometimes looking straight into the camera as if issuing a challenge: “Do you get déjà vu?” she asked over and over. While answering her own question in the outro — “I know you get déjà vu” — she danced around her makeshift stage with a triumphant smile that every band member returned. After reliving the pain of a tearful breakup for all to see, Rodrigo made sure to revel in the last laugh.

For many people, TikTok has become a digital destination to which one can escape for a few minutes (or hours) of mindless entertainment. The social media platform may seem to provide nothing more than funny animal videos, cooking inspiration, or a new dance to learn. And yet, some industrious individuals have found a way to capitalize on the platform’s vast user base to advance their lifelong dreams. Among them is 17-year-old singer-songwriter Jenna Raine, who has amassed a TikTok following of over 1.4 million followers at the time of publication. Her latest single, “see you later (ten years)” has millions of streams, landing it atop Spotify’s Global and United States Viral Charts.
The story behind this hit song is evidence enough of the power social media can have in shaping the future of the music industry. At the age of 14, Raine’s songwriting instructor challenged her to write 100 songs in order to hone her craft. While it took a few years for Raine to accept the challenge, she decided at the beginning of 2021 that this was exactly the type of content she needed to set her apart in the vast TikTok landscape.
She said to herself, “You are going to write those 100 songs. Finally, you’re gonna do that. And you’re gonna make it a series, you’re gonna make it a kind of a fan experience for everybody.” While it took some time for this songwriting experiment to pay dividends, a follower’s suggestion for song 45 to be about “the right person, wrong time” provided the inspiration for “see you later (ten years).” Ultimately, it was Raine’s ability to connect with her fans on TikTok that allowed her to write what she called “the first song to really show who I am and who I want to be as a singer-songwriter.”
Raine’s engaged and eager fanbase is not merely the product of algorithmic luck. Instead, it is the result of hours of hard work on Raine’s part, who has been creating content on the platform since the summer of 2019. When asked about how seriously she takes TikTok, Raine said, “TikTok is like an everyday thing where I’m trying to think of what’s the next step, what’s the next video, what do people want to hear, what do people want to see? It’s kind of something that has somewhat turned into a job.”
Such a process requires hours of dedicated and purposeful effort each day. While others may simply scroll through their “For You” pages and passively enjoy different kinds of content, Raine says she is constantly wondering, “how can I make this trend me and different from what everyone else is doing?” While this interactive approach to content curation and songwriting has proved to be very beneficial to Raine, she said, “It really is so much harder than people think it is.”
Beyond providing ideas for new songs, Raine’s clever use of social media has also furthered her personal artistic goal of connecting with her supporters in a way that was not possible a mere ten years ago. When she released “see you later (ten years),” Raine said, “There was a huge increase in people following me on Instagram. And I think that was because the song made people realize, ‘Oh, this is a singer-songwriter and I want to be one of the first people to discover her.’”
Armed with this acute knowledge of her fans’ motivations, Raine made every effort to entertain her fans, posting comedic videos as well as new songs, always with an affinity for creating relatable content. It was this relatability that not only allowed Raine to create a rapidly-growing, very positive TikTok page but also helped every fan to feel as though they were a part of Raine’s journey. “My goal is to make my supporters feel like family,” Raine said.
As for what lies ahead for Raine, she plans on releasing music early next year, which she is creating with her “dream collaborator” Ryan Tedder, a record producer who has worked with the likes of Taylor Swift and Adele. Raine also hopes to get back to performing live as soon as possible, so she can finally connect with her fans without the barrier of a screen. She said, “I think once I perform ‘see you later’ live for an audience that knows it, it will be like, ‘wow, maybe I’ve made it.”

“La Fama,” released on Nov. 11, is the first single from Spanish singer Rosalía's third studio album, “Motomami.” It features Canadian pop singer The Weeknd, who previously recruited Rosalía to feature on the remix of his chart-smashing track, “Blinding Lights.” In an interview with NMD, Rosalía revealed that the track was recorded long before “Blinding Lights,” dating back almost three years.
“La Fama” is nothing like the other collaboration between the two, the attention to detail on its production being its main novel attribute.
Translated as “The Fame,” “La Fama” entails a tragic love story that sees the singers lose their lovers to the time-consuming music industry. The song is narrated as a story within a story, where Rosalía hands it off to The Weeknd to voice what her lover once said to her. For example, when Rosalía characterizes her fixation on fame as “something that was bad for him” in the opening verse, The Weeknd answers that sentiment from the perspective of the lover in the chorus, “Fame is a bad lover and she won't truly love you.” Here, fame and true love are juxtaposed and counterproductive to one another with the use of the feminine pronouns to personify fame and the imperative tense in “nunca la vayas a casar,” or “don't you dare marry her,” marking the lover’s response. That push-and-pull feeling echoes throughout the song, climaxing at the bridge when both vocalists sing that there’s no escaping fame’s hold on them, even if it comes at the price of letting “the one” get away. The lyrical cohesiveness here makes the story come full circle, the narrators’ fame ending what once was a promising love with heartbreak.
Latin American bachata is the perfect vehicle to narrate such a tragically sexy love story. The four instrumental core rhythms are the driving force on the track. There’s the deep thrum of the bongó on the first, third, and fourth beats keeping the tempo slow and steady. The rattling of the güira dressing up the percussion that syncopates the requinto (lead guitar). These elements are all very textbook traditional bachata, keeping the spirit of the song sensual and rhythmic. With Spanish producers like Tainy working on the bass production and the insertion of synthesizer elements in The Weeknd’s chorus, however, the song feels authentic yet modern. Each of these instrumental introductions continue throughout, only diminishing into the background in pivotal thematic moments, like the pause between the bridge and the chorus that lets the ad libs come to the foreground. This natural progression of the beat is dynamic enough that it doesn’t leave the listener wanting for something drastic like a beat drop, which would have interrupted the continuity of the lyrics.
Rosalía has stepped outside of her comfort zone on this track, seeing as she is more familiar with heavy reworked beats and neo-pop styles in her discography thus far. The artist mentioned to NMD that the inspiration to do bachata on this single came from the Spanish legend Romeo Santos, a pioneer of the genre. It is highly commendable that in her first attempt at the style, Rosalía produced something that sounds as classic yet innovative as “La Fama.”
The Weeknd evidently also put in the time-consuming work to learn the Spanish lyrics, singing fluidly and fluently in a language foreign to him. This feat is almost as impressive as the challenge of getting a foreign singer who is wildly famous for his own distinctive synth-pop style to sing bachata in a way that sounds natural and not forced. Not only did he have to acclimate to a rhythm stripped bare, but he also had to let go of all of his signature reworked voice effects that can be heard in the breathy vocals on his latest project “After Hours.” Safe to say, The Weeknd is a musical chameleon, working hard to add his unique flair to this track without imposing too much of his own production style upon it.
“La Fama” exceeds expectations as the first single from “Motomami,” advertising it as a very promising album if this same meticulous approach was applied in its making.

Jennifer Lopez’s latest single, a romantic and dramatic love song entitled “On My Way” released off of the soundtrack to her upcoming 2022 movie “Marry Me,” serves its purpose as a promotional tool; however, when compared to the rest of Lopez’s impressive discography, the song’s cliché lyrics and uninspiring composition make it a musical letdown.
Lopez’s new film is slated to be released on Feb. 11, just in time for Valentine’s Day. The movie’s rom-com plot, which involves Lopez’s pop star character deciding to marry a stranger from the audience after her musician partner cheats on her, is certainly on theme with its release date. Much like the premise of the movie, the song “On My Way” is equally cliché.
Musically, the song relies on a slow, dramatic, artificial “build” to create drama and emotion. It starts off with a slow piano riff. Then, as the song approaches the second chorus, rising string instruments and shimmering percussion build behind Lopez’s vocals. The song finally builds to its full sound halfway through the second chorus, as a lively, pulsing beat anchors Lopez’s repeated calls of “On my way, On my way to you.” The structure is overused, tired, and frankly, quite boring. Lopez, while admittedly not known for complex and sophisticated musical techniques, does usually offer catchy, fun, and innovative sounds; this feels like a half-attempt at a swelling and passionate love song, just without any of the passion.
In the same vein, lyrically, “On My Way” leans on a collection of repeated and lazy clichés. Lyrics like “Every teardrop felt so heavy” and “Every heartbreak was a yellow brick road” are uninspired. The listener finds themselves missing Lopez’s past lyrics: "I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side,” or even "Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block." (Okay, maybe that one wouldn’t fit in this song, but at least it’s memorable and original.)
By the time the song hits the halfway mark, the listener has already heard the entire song. After the two verses, there is not a single change, in either sound or lyrics. Rather, Lopez repeats the same lines as refrains swell in the background. The intention here is clear: The listener will undoubtedly have those lines in their head, and as an advertisement for an impending cinematic release, it is very effective. The song is a perfect anthem for a cheesy, romantic, Valentine’s Day movie. It’s just no “Jenny From the Block,” and it’s not trying to be. While this song certainly won’t find itself on any “Best of Jennifer Lopez” playlists, it serves its purpose as a promotion, and hopefully, “Marry Me” outdoes its soundtrack.

To celebrate their 10-year anniversary, Little Mix released “Between Us” to affirm the strength of their bond. Founded in 2011 on “The X Factor UK,” Little Mix was originally a four-person girl group that downsized to a trio after Jesy Nelson left in 2020. Known for producing hit after hit, the group lives up to their classic pop ballads of the past with this new release.
“Between Us” revolves around the power of sisterhood and friendship that has been a theme for the band through all of their years in the spotlight. The lyrics “Nothing comes between us” appear 10 times in the song, emphasizing how much the songwriters want listeners to realize the importance of the group’s 10-year partnership. Furthermore, the song begins and ends with the same lyrics: “When the curtains close and all of the lights go down / Safe to say I’ll stay, I will always stick around.” Evidently, all the members of Little Mix are inextricably connected and owe their careers to one another.
The song begins with a lyrical backtrack without a distinctive beat. However, after establishing the initial lyrics that return at the closing, drums join the vocals to add strength and confidence to the concept of collective bonds. As the song progresses, it gets louder as it becomes more musically complex with additional layers of harmonies that culminate in a very robust ending.
For fans of Little Mix, this song is especially significant because it mentions some of the group’s older songs, such as “Wings,” “Power,” and “Sweet Melody” through phrases such as “Remember the day when we finally found our wings? / It changed our lives, gave us the power to do anything.”
Paying homage to the past is not only a walk down memory lane for listeners, but also an intangible piece of memorabilia for the band members. In a BuzzFeed interview, Jade Thirlwall called this song a “celebration.”
Overall, the song effectively portrays the themes of harmony, love, and an affinity for one another, in accordance with Little Mix’s goals for this new release.

Harvard reversed its decision to close campus day care centers during the first three weeks of January on Wednesday after more than 120 families signed onto an open letter calling on the University to continue providing child care services while it moves most operations online.
Campus Child Care, the non-profit that manages Harvard’s six day care centers, will reopen on Jan. 12 following a 12-day closure. The school had originally planned to close its child care centers during the first three weeks of the new year as campus operations move online due to the pandemic.
The University announced Wednesday that the centers, which provide services to more than 400 children, will reopen with reduced hours and prorated tuition.
The change comes after 121 parents signed onto an open letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and other top administrators calling on the school to implement “a revised plan” as soon as possible.
The letter called child care an “essential service” enabling affiliates to continue fulfilling all work-related responsibilities without compromising on their children’s wellbeing.
“We are exhausted,” the open letter said. “We cannot put in the work for Harvard if Harvard does not support us in the care of our children.”
The letter noted that the child care centers remained open through the pandemic with daily symptom checks, indoor masking, and testing. With the new requirement that Harvard affiliates get Covid-19 booster shots, the letter added “the risk to [Campus Child Care] community members is as well-mitigated as possible.”
In an email to Campus Child Care staff and families on Wednesday, University Human Resources Vice President Manuel Cuevas-Trisan and Faculty Development and Diversity Senior Vice Provost Judith D. Singer apologized for the added anxiety created by the initial announcement.
“We sincerely appreciate the concerns both teachers and parents have raised following our initial announcement that the centers would be closed during this period,” the administrators wrote. “We are mindful that this announcement added to the anxiety already experienced by both center families and center teaching staff due to the continued unpredictability of the pandemic, and for that we apologize.”
The centers will remain completely closed for the first nine days of January, during which teachers will be tested for Covid-19 three times and receive booster shots if they have not already. All families will be refunded for this period. Any family that opts to keep their children home during the first three weeks of January will also receive a refund.
The centers will reopen for staff on Jan. 10 before welcoming families back on Jan. 12. Children will be required to present a negative Covid test taken within one day of returning to day care and undergo daily symptom checks.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Maya Sen ’00, whose 2-year-old child attends day care at Harvard, wrote that she “would suspend or cut back on research and writing” without Campus Child Care. The revised plan, she wrote, addresses some of her concerns.
“It’s a huge relief to know faculty parents with kids enrolled in on-campus day care won’t be out of work for most of January, but the possibility of sudden, prolonged closures is still really worrisome,” Sen wrote.
Conor J. Walsh, a professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences whose two children attend Harvard day care, also said the revised plan is an improvement. But he added that he is still unsure what his family will do during the 12-day closure.
“With the revised plan, while it does provide the possibility for more child care in January that was originally planned, it’s still a massive blow to not have child care [for part of January],” Walsh said.
Laura H. Owen ’06, the editor of the Nieman Journalism Lab whose 22-month-old child attends Campus Child Care, wrote in an email that she was “overall satisfied” with the change.
“I think the revised plan is reasonable,” Owen wrote. “A week and a half of working without childcare is still really hard, but at least for my family, it is inconvenient, not catastrophic.”
Owen added that she hopes Harvard administrators will include parents and teachers in decision-making processes around child care earlier on.
The school also announced Wednesday that it will establish a child care working group “to focus on ways we can continue to build trust and strengthen relationships with all members of our community.”
“Going forward, I hope that Harvard’s administration will include parents — and teachers — in decisions about the youngest members of its community early on in the decision-making process,” Owen wrote. “We will come up with better ideas when we work together.”
