After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard students in most Houses received flyers that parodied final club punch invitations. They invited students to punch “The Pigeon, Harvard’s newest final club,” wearing “semi-bro attire.” The fake punch invitations quickly generated news coverage due to their inflammatory mockery of the exclusive nature of final clubs: They read, “Jews need not apply. Seriously, no fucking Jews. Coloreds OK.” They also cited one of the three values of The Pigeon, “Love,” as synonymous with “rophynol,” a misspelling of rohypnol, known to most students as roofies.
Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds posted a response to the flyers in the comments section of The Crimson’s article about the flyers. She wrote, “I find these flyers offensive. They are not a reflection of the values of our community. Even if intended as satirical in nature, they are hurtful and offensive to many students, faculty and staff, and do not demonstrate the level of thoughtfulness and respect we expect at Harvard.”
While we too find the flyers tasteless and their use of inflammatory language inappropriate and unconstructive, a response to the prank cannot be properly made without a meaningful appraisal of the role of final clubs at Harvard. In this vein, we instead choose to highlight the very real threats wrought on our campus by final clubs. The satirical letters may have failed to demonstrate “thoughtfulness and respect,” but their implication that final clubs are unsafe for women is much more noteworthy.
What is perhaps most troubling about the flyers is that they brought to light the destructive influence of final clubs on social life on campus. They have forced into the spotlight something that many on campus feel privately: that final clubs systematically discriminate against women. Not only have the clubs failed to extend membership to women many years after Harvard became a coeducational institution, but they also routinely invite hoards of women and few men to their parties. It is not difficult to imagine that the male-controlled party venues, where club members decide what is served and who is invited and where women can only ever come as guests, may be unsafe for female students. While the University does not release statistics about incidences of sexual assault at on-campus and off-campus properties, it is not unreasonable to suspect, as many students do, that final clubs engender environments that are conducive to sexual violence. It is clear that final clubs have a negative influence on Harvard’s social scene, and the controversy that has erupted over last week’s prank flyers is a particularly unfortunate display of their destructive divisiveness.
It might not have been the best way to do it, but the authors of the Pigeon punch letter have effectively pointed to the well-earned reputation of final clubs for misogyny and exclusivity. The clubs continue to be the most visible discriminatory organizations on campus, and, to use Dean Hammonds’s words, “They are not a reflection of the values of our community.” Any Harvard students and administrators interested in ending discrimination on campus should turn their attention to final clubs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reading period starts today. This means that if you are a Harvard student, you are almost certainly generally juggling 150 percent of your personal capacity and doing each task somehow at 30 percent motivation. Maybe you aren’t sleeping. At times, you and your friends will trade frustrations: “I don’t even believe what I’m arguing,” they’ll say. Or, “This has zero application to real life.”
In my sophomore year, I offered to read and present Hegel for my tutorial. (I was just a little more young and stupid then than I am now, clearly.) I almost immediately realized that this was a serious mistake because Hegel writes things like: "But in developing itself independently to totality, the principle of particularity passes over into universality, and only there does it attain its truth and the right to which its positive actuality is entitled." For two hundred pages, I was curled up on the couch with the book on my head, hoping to absorb it directly by osmosis. Next to me, my roommate was trying to memorize a zillion Arabic verb tenses. To cheer us up, an older friend told us about how during a particularly bad study time in college, she had started jumping off desks with her roommates yelling: "We are birds! We are birds!"
So we did the same—only we made pterodactyl noises, which are superior. And Hegel (and my roommate's Arabic) still didn't make any more sense, but life was okay.
I’m a big fan of choosing classes that are meaningful, despite a few of my own frustrating experiences along the way. But still, at some point in the next two weeks you will likely end up doing something that is, by all estimates, utterly absurd. If it’s the not assignment itself, it’ll be the crunch time in which you accomplish it, or the amount of time you spend on Reddit before you begin. And ultimately, it’s all pretty much inherently absurd when you realize you’re worrying about letters on a piece of paper that already makes you elite. Meanwhile, other people are stressing over whether they will be fired, or if their child will be cured of an illness, or if their marriage will survive. Absurdity is looking over flashcards at four in the morning and calculating whether our GPAs will stay high enough to meet some imaginary standard.
Most of us know this. I write the column to remind, not instruct, as the saying goes. But here’s the reminder all the same: Among the majority of us worrying about the difference between a B+ and an A-, there are fellow students with far bigger problems. And one of the many reasons to keep some perspective for the next few weeks is that there are friends among us who are silently struggling with whether they’ll be forced to take a semester off, or how to grieve, or how to face an addiction, or something of a similarly dark and serious nature. When we open our mouths in the dining hall, we don’t want them to feel that everyone around them is a self-absorbed chattering box and that they are all alone.
The first secret that I’ve discovered between the time I was naïve enough to try to interpret Hegel and now is this: The best way to not quietly lose your mind under large amounts of stress (over something that is ultimately absurd) is to embrace the absurdity and run with it. The principle is already apparent in primal scream. (And in the various Secret Santa activities that my house is famous for. Or secret penguin/ninja/panda/politically-correct non-religious entity endeavors, if we must.)
And the second thing I’ve learned is to think about how much more seriously some people are struggling. It’s not necessary to imagine starving people across the globe—your roommates may be the most relevant example. So, before you head over to Harvard FML this week, try to enjoy the absurd. Enjoy it. I’m going to try; join me. Let us take this brief stretch of time that is ultimately meant just for us to learn and make it playful where it is exhausting and ridiculous. Life itself is full of darker and more difficult absurdities, and we will need our playfulness there. Then, with the same bright energy, let’s apply a little empathy and perspective to each other.
Happy studying.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 2010, along with students who have since graduated, we began a campaign to alter the conversation about final clubs and to demand administrative acknowledgement of Harvard’s social space problem. Not the first campaign around these issues and hopefully not the last, we called ourselves the Final Club Campaign. We wanted this campaign to be what we hoped Harvard’s social scene could someday be—inclusive, full of diverse perspectives, and fun. Trying to meet these standards in the kick-off event of our campaign, we came up with the idea to door-drop “fake punch” letters to every Harvard student. The letters were invitations to a dialogue on final clubs and social space and described some of the attributes of clubs we found troubling: exclusivity, gender-segregation, and lack of transparency. Two years later, our campaign having died out, we find ourselves still troubled over final clubs and social space—and now frustrated by both the misguided “fake punch” letters of late and by Harvard’s inadequate response to them.
The flyers slipped under the doors of many students last week, inviting them to a punch event of the fictitious “Pigeon Club,” were not the start of a meaningful conversation about final clubs. Their creators’ poor grasp of the issues surrounding the clubs was evident in the flyers’ irreverent invocation of discrimination and date rape. The references in the flyers to anti-semitic policies, racial insensitivity, and date rape drugs may have been intended as attacks against final clubs, but in applying such generalized defamation, they merely caricatured the clubs and seriously undermined legitimate critiques of them.
Final clubs do have histories of exclusion of Jewish students and students of color, and many of us still find that final clubs fail at creating meaningful diversity on par with the makeup of the student body. Additionally, some final clubs do have histories related to sexual assault, and the issue of party safety has been repeatedly raised as a concern in campaigns like our own. However, the tone and offensive language of the Pigeon flyer made it easy to reject these truths as absurd or out of touch. What’s worse, we fear that this was the point. Whatever their creators’ intentions, they succeeded in making a spectacle but managed to bury the real issues at hand.
The impulse of students and administrators to disparage the offensive humor of the flyers—but to remain silent regarding the problems underlying that “crass” humor—was a familiar and disappointing avoidance. Appearing to raise the profile of final club issues, the flyers instead offered another distraction from substantive engagement with those issues.
The spirit of our 2010 Final Club Campaign was perhaps too idealistic and ambitious: to create dialogue across many perspectives, to challenge student apathy and defensiveness, and to push the administration towards greater responsibility for creating social space solutions. Our campaign ultimately failed, in part because it was going to require a lot more than dialogue and “fake punch” letters to shift such an entrenched status quo. But we maintain that “fake punching” has productive potential, whether done in service of an organized campaign or merely as a small counter-pressure to the dominant acceptance that if given the option, one should join a club. Our initial letters in 2010, along with similar letters with sincere “don’t punch” messages before and after, were distributed with the thought that, wherever you fall on the issue, it’s one worth discussing.
The Pigeon letter caused such vocal responses from students and administrators because it was easy to respond to. We all (hopefully) know to condemn overt anti-semitism, racism, and rape. But what we know less is how to respond to the complex problems that final clubs and other social spaces actually present us with at Harvard. We hope that we as students and administrators won’t be diverted by what was obvious here and will instead take this as a moment to examine the less glaring but persistent problems that continue to trouble us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As senior fall comes to a close, I find myself increasingly reflective on my four years at Harvard. Am I the person I want to be to others? How will I be remembered when I graduate? Are the people I am making time for the people who will still be in my life 10 years down the road? All of these questions are impossible to answer and somewhat cliché, but I nonetheless find myself trapped in endless nostalgia, already missing my college years as if they are already gone. As Eric T. Justin ’13 described in his column “Harvard’s Whiny One-Upmanship,’” sometimes we all become too “busy” or too self-absorbed to appreciate and enjoy arguably one of the most carefree times of our lives, where we are free to pursue any academic interest and where all our best friends live within walking distance. Our time here is finite, and each day is a new opportunity to start over and be the person we want our classmates to remember us as.
During my time here, I have learned not to get caught up in people and things that don’t make me happy. It has taken my three years plus a semester away from Harvard to realize what I really enjoy doing here and who I really enjoy seeing. During the first few years of college, after getting caught up with friends of convenience and resume-padding activities, we can find ourselves with a social group that doesn’t see all sides of us and a list of activities we are invested in yet not passionate about. I finally realized that if I don’t like how I feel around someone or I no longer have anything substantial to talk about with them, then I should focus my energy on other friends or getting to know classmates I haven’t met yet. If I don’t enjoy an activity that is supposedly going to help my future career, I quit. In viewing activities as stepping stones, we can sometimes lose sight of a completely different path that would make us more happy.
 
Another major flaw at Harvard is gossip: A frequent amount of dining hall conversations I sit down to consists of talking about hookups, potential hookups, past hookups, and things that happen at final clubs. Though this is college and mindless gossip comes with the territory, I’ve learned that everything comes out in the wash.  I have felt weird and awful when things have gotten back about me that other people have said about me (whether true or not), and I have felt even more weird and awful when things have gotten back to other people that I said about them. The people I respect and admire most in my class are the people I have never heard say anything negative about anyone else.
One of the biggest mistakes that students make at Harvard is feeling like we are alone in our problems or sadness here. On the other hand, it is easy for all of us to forget that we aren’t the only ones with hectic lives. We make catch-ups with friends in color-coated blocks on our Google Calendars, or we tell people we are “just too busy—can we try for coffee in three weeks?” But we are all busy, and I firmly believe in making time for the people you care about. We are remembered by how we make other people feel, and if we make our friends and classmates feel unimportant or not worth enough to take up some of our time, they will remember that about us ten years down the road.
At the end of each semester, my roommate and I go to the top of the Science Center for a nighttime overview of the past few months and our goals for the next semester. The view from the top, where we have an aerial view of Annenberg, the bell towers, the Charles River, and the Boston skyline, provides the perspective to help us realize that all the things that stress us out on a daily basis here are insignificant in the grandeur of us getting to be here in the first place. Of course, every semester I have profound revelations on the rooftop (usually while under the influence of John Mayer), and every semester after, I usually repeat the same mistakes or fall into the same traps I did from the semester before. Though this moment of clarity is short lived, I finally feel like as long as I focus on the people and things that I have discovered make me happy, and as long as I take my responsibilities and not myself seriously, the rest is irrelevant.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today almost anyone can snap a photograph at a moment’s notice with a cell phone, but photography has acted as a medium of democratic expression since its conception, History of Art and Architecture Professor Robin E. Kelsey suggested at the Harvard Allston Education Portal Tuesday night.
The talk, entitled “Performing for the Camera: Some Thoughts on Photography,” gave audience members what Kelsey called a “distilled version” of his popular Culture and Belief course, “Seeing is Believing: A History of Photography.”
“My interest is really in what photography has done in terms of how we present ourselves as individuals,” said Kelsey, noting that he is most fascinated by the self-representation photography enables.
According to Kelsey, the emergence of photography as a less expensive and less specialized form of visualization ushered in an era in which more people could capture images than ever before.
“The camera didn’t care who you were like an artist would. The germ of photography is the marvelous democratic potential,” he said.
Kelsey remarked that the nature of photography is continually changing and cited the popularization of cell phones as one transformational agent.
“There’s now a kind of cell phone aesthetic that has a sense of immediacy and authenticity that people really like,” he said.
Kelsey also acknowledged ethical implications of advancements in photographic technologies. The widespread use of cameras, particularly in public spaces, has complicated the rights of the subject being photographed.
“It’s a huge ethical issue,” said Kelsey. “Because I’m an art lover I’d be sad if photographers couldn’t do what they do, but I understand that people don’t think it’s fair that other people are making money off of them.”
Kelsey, who won the Roslyn Abramson Award in 2006 for excellence and sensitivity in teaching undergraduates, is a model of Harvard pedagogy at its best, said professor Robert A. Lue, faculty director of the Ed Portal.
“One thing that struck me immediately was the clarity of Robin’s thinking coupled with his unquestionable commitment to teaching and learning,” said Lue of his first meeting with Kelsey.
The lecture was part of the Ed Portal’s Faculty Speaker Series, which engages the public with a variety of topics from Harvard’s classrooms.

For the first time in recent memory, Harvard Campus Services and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter have teamed to bring holiday cheer to Harvard Square’s homeless population.
Last week, Campus Services placed collection boxes in upperclassmen dining halls and in Annenberg. Using donations from undergraduates and faculty, the organizations plan to assemble holiday care packages to be distributed at the shelter.
Charles A. Hobbs ’13, an administrative director at the homeless shelter, said his organization is accepting donations ranging from hats and scarves to wrapped treats and gifts.
“We’ve never done this before, but it seems like a great idea,” Hobbs said. “I’m sure it’s going to have a really positive impact on the holiday season for these individuals. We really want to make as large an impact as we can.”
The boxes will be removed on Dec. 14, according to University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall.
Harvard has collaborated with the homeless shelter in a number of other ways. The University donates leftover food from the dining halls to the shelter to feed the homeless, sending several hundred meals a month, according to Marshall. Harvard also donates approximately 14,000 meals a year go to the Greater Boston Food Bank.
According to Hobbs, Campus Services has also formed a partnership with Phillips Brooks House Association, an umbrella organization for social service groups. Through Dec. 14, PBHA will seek donations of new or gently used hats, gloves, coats, and sweaters for the shelter’s care packages.
Harvard took the initiative to form this partnership, Hobbs said.
“It was actually the school that reached out to us about making a donation,” Hobbs said. “We have an ongoing relationship with them, but this is the first time that they’ve reached out about doing a possible fundraiser,” Hobbs said.
According to its website, the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter has provided services for homeless individuals since 1983. It is the only student-run homeless shelter in the nation, and the first in Harvard Square.
The shelter, which heavily draws its volunteers from the Harvard student body, provides housing for up to 24 homeless guests each night,

Jane Pickering, deputy director and director of public programs at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, will be the first executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced Tuesday.
“Under the leadership of Jane Pickering, Harvard is launching a new model for university museums, one that has the potential to be so much more than the sum of its parts,” Smith told the Harvard Gazette.
Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, a consortium of six Faculty of Arts and Sciences museum, was formed last spring, and Pickering said she looks forward to shaping this fledgling institution.
“My responsibilities are really to lead the effort of this new entity and to do some interesting programming,” said Pickering, adding that she would act as a liaison between the University and Cambridge community.
As the consortium’s first executive director, Pickering will work closely with the museums’ faculty leaders and stakeholders. She will be responsible for the major functions of the museums, such as exhibits, public programs, and administration.
Pickering will assume this position with many years of experience under her belt. She has worked at university museums at Oxford, MIT, and, most recently, Yale.
“My entire career, basically since I got my master’s degree, has been in university museums,” she said. “I’ve been privileged to work at great universities.”
The decision to appoint Pickering was fueled by her commitment to engaging the public with museum collections.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor James J. McCarthy—who chaired the faculty executive board that developed the consortium last spring—also noted Pickering’s past appointments.
“[Pickering’s] broad experience in university-based museums, from curator to director, and her accomplishments in each of these roles bodes well for a swift and steady launch of the HMSC under her leadership,” he told the Gazette.
Pickering will assume her new stead at the helm of HMSC on January 14, 2013.
“One of the most exciting things for me is the chance to do something new,” Pickering said. “The opportunity to work with these six museums is just really the opportunity of the lifetime.”

The Harvard Corporation approved a 2 percent increase in Harvard’s endowment distribution, the revenues which the University receives annually from the endowment, from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2014, according to an excerpt from Harvard’s budget guidance documents obtained by The Crimson.
The 2 percent figure represents the percent change in the amount of money withdrawn from the University’s endowment for its operations in the next fiscal year, which will begin on July 1, 2013 and last until June 30, 2014. The distribution increased by 5 percent from FY 2012 to FY 2013, which began this July. The endowment distribution varies from year to year, with the Corporation either increasing or decreasing the rate by small percentages  depending on the success of Harvard’s investments and financial needs for the coming year.
The University’s budgeting process is overseen by the Corporation, Harvard’s highest governing body. Each fall, the members of the Corporation meet to approve the change in the endowment distribution for the next fiscal year, based on projected returns on the endowment, which is overseen by the Harvard Management Company. The annual University expenses coasts at roughly $4 billion. In FY 2012, $1.4 billion of those costs were covered by the endowment distribution.
In this year’s budgeting, Corporation members used conservative estimates of the University’s endowment returns, costs, and revenues,  projecting figures at the “bottom end of the University’s payout policy range,” according to the budget document, meaning the payout rate, which is the percentage of the endowment used for revenues and generally falls between 5 and 5.5 percent, will probably fall closer to the latter. The document also projected an 8 percent return for the endowment by the end of FY 2013, marginally higher than the 7.25 percent that HMC targets for its average returns. The lower predicted payout rate is based on “continued volatility in the financial markets,” according to the document, which explains that Harvard’s distribution formula is designed to stabilize budgets by smoothing out endowment gains and losses over time.
The University’s Annual Financial Report for fiscal year 2012, which was released at the beginning of November, noted a small deficit of $4.5 million. In a conversation with the Harvard Gazette, Vice President for Finance Dan S. Shore attributed this to pressures on a number of revenue sources, including declining federal research funding and tuition. Shore said that this deficit should be considered “in the context of an economy that isn’t coming back as quickly as anyone would like.”
While the endowment has recovered just over half of the nearly $11 billion it lost in value following the 2008 financial crisis, Harvard administrators announced in September that the endowment investments had dropped by half a percent to $30.7 billion in fiscal year 2012—the first time the fund has dipped in value since 2009, when the endowment saw a precipitous decline triggered by the financial crisis. Prior to 2008, the endowment stood at $36.9 billion in value.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 5, 2012, at 3:41 p.m.
This semester, conversations about rape and sexual assault have come to the forefront of campus discussion, as several controversies both here and elsewhere have garnered the student body’s attention, and last night, two events on consent and sexual assault continued the conversation.
The first, a showcase entitled “Speak About It,” was a performance-based presentation about consent and sexual assault that featured cast members who told stories and acted out skits based on true events and testimonials. The performance, which was sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, is designed for college audiences and has educated young adults across the nation.
“If people leave the show and talk about these issues with their friends, family members, and partners, that’s all we can ask,” said cast member Shana Natelson.
The event is part of OSAPR’s effort to improve their programs and services, said OSAPR prevention specialist Christopher M. Gilbert.
Just an hour later, students gathered at Holden Chapel to share their reflections on rape culture in a event called “Rape Culture Speak-Out,” which discussed rape culture in a forum setting.
Organizers said they sought to create a space where students could feel comfortable speaking about rape. “When it comes to rape culture, it’s very much associated with silence,” said Amanda J. Gokee ’14, a co-organizer of the event.
Those in attendance were asked to adhere to a code of confidentiality about the contents of the speakers’ presentations.
Although seven speakers were arranged ahead of time, sign-up sheets were passed around and members of the audience were invited to participated.
“The sheer act of talking about [rape] can be really empowering,” Kate Sim ’14 said, the founder of Our Harvard Can Better, which organized the event.
In her opening remarks, Sim said her group hoped to encourage scrutiny of the rape culture prevalent at Harvard and greater society.
“Rape culture really comes down to a set of social norms that constrain meaningful interaction and vilify sexuality that affects all of us as survivors and allies,” Sim said.
Our Harvard Can Do Better was also responsible for organizing the petition to put the affirmative consent referendum on the Undergraduate Council ballot. In addition to the ballot, which passed by a landslide majority, recent months at Harvard have seen the news of two alleged rapes in and near Harvard Yard in August and hearty discussion of a former Amherst student’s account of her experience dealing with administrators after she was raped.
Cyatharine M. Alias ’15, who attended “Speak Out,” said the event covered more than “Sex Signals,” the program during freshman orientation week.
“I think it touched on a variety of things that other performances like Sex Signals don’t really talk about, like the healing process and the gay community,” Alias said.
Representatives from a number of campus peer counseling groups were present, both to speak out themselves and be on hand for those who might wish to seek out help after the event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 5, 2012, at 5:46 a.m.
After a scheduling conflict generated controversy, a discussion forum on affirmative action Tuesday evening drew nearly 50 students—most of whom voiced support of the college admissions policy.
The event, which was hosted by the Harvard Foundation, came under fire from several members of Harvard’s Latino community because it had been slated to take place at the same time as Concilio Latino’s previously scheduled holiday dinner.
In an email circulated over several campus lists, several students urged their peers to sign an online petition to reschedule the discussion event, expressing concern that the scheduling overlap would exclude Latino students from a conversation in which they hold an important stake. The petition garnered 129 signatures before it was closed, and on Monday afternoon, petition organizers sent an email to supporters indicating that the Harvard Foundation had agreed to change the time of the event.
When asked at the event about the scheduling conflict, Loc V. Truong, assistant director of the Harvard Foundation, and Tiffany M. Ramos ’16, an intern at the Harvard Foundation, declined to comment.
Although most students at the event rallied in support of affirmative action, discussion members maintained a respectful tone.
In a discussion of whether affirmative action programs should be based primarily on socioeconomic status, Ramos offered a psychological argument to oppose eliminating race-based affirmative action.
“Children in kindergarten, in third grade perform poorer because of the psychological impact of having to recognize themselves as a certain color in a not-so post-racist society,” Ramos said.
In the final discussion question of the night, attendees debated whether they thought affirmative action reinforces negative stereotypes about minority groups.
One respondent, Merilin Castillo ’16, described affirmative action as “not the ideal solution” because of negative perceptions of the policy. Nevertheless, she said, “it’s better to have a Band-Aid than an open wound.”
Sarah R. Siskind ’14, whose Crimson editorial column arguing against affirmative action earlier this month provoked backlash from some, took part in the discussion.
“Though the perspectives opposing affirmative action were somewhat underrepresented [at the event], I suppose it would be very disproportionate of the Harvard community if more than two had shown up,” Siskin wrote in a statement after the event. “On the whole, I truly enjoyed hearing people’s opinions face-to-face.”

University leaders will sit down with student advocates of fossil fuel divestment and explore the possibility of creating a social choice fund, senior University officials told The Crimson this week.
“The Corporation has an obligation to listen—to students, to faculty, to other members of the community—because it educates our decisions, but in a community like Harvard you’re never going to have unanimity on anything,” said William F. Lee ’72, a member of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body.
Members of the Corporation’s Committee on Shareholder Responsibility will meet with students next semester who over the course of the fall have advocated for the University to divest its more than $30 billion endowment from fossil fuels.
When the issue was offered as a referendum during Undergraduate Council elections last month, 72 percent of undergraduates who voted supported divestment.
Although the University will meet with student representatives, University President Drew G. Faust said it was “unlikely” that Harvard would change its investment strategy as a result of the conversation.
“My argument would be that our most effective impact on climate change is not going to come through any kind of divestment activity,” Faust said. “It’s going to come through what we do with our teaching, our research, the people...we support, the students who may be the heads of the EPA or all kinds of organizations.”
In addition, Corporation members said the University is entertaining the creation of a social choice fund—a fund to which alumni could donate that would be invested with an eye towards Socially Responsible Investment. SRI encourages the incorporation of environmental, social, and governance concerns into the evaluation of investments.
“The desire to see a social choice fund at Harvard is a topic that began coming up with increasing frequency in my conversations with students and alumni last spring, and it led me to suggest to the Corporation that we explore the possibility of creating such a fund,” said Faust in a statement. “We are in the process of examining how such funds are managed at other institutions to learn more about best practices and to determine whether a similar approach makes sense for Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Arsenal on the Charles in Watertown has enjoyed a storied existence since its founding in 1816. First a producer of weaponry for the Civil War and World Wars I and II, the property then saw a quieter life as a Harvard-owned office park.
Next year, it will move on to the next chapter of its existence as the headquarters of electronic health records company athenahealth, Inc., which will buy the 29-acre property from Harvard for $168.5 million.
Fewer than 10 miles outside of downtown Boston, the property contains 11 buildings, some of which are about 200 years old. Athenahealth headquarters have been located at the Arsenal on the Charles since 2005 and currently take up a large portion of the 760,000 square-foot property.
“The Arsenal on the Charles’ open and expansive architecture, outdoor campus feel, and proximity to Boston really fit with our culture and made it the logical place for us to expand. We are excited to deepen our roots in Massachusetts, and continue our growth as an engaged corporate citizen of Watertown,” athenahealth Chairman and CEO Jonathan Bush said in a Wednesday press release announcing the deal. “I’m particularly excited about the rich history of the arsenal.... The fact that we are able to own and in fact headquarter ourselves in the very same buildings from which that first industrial revolution rose, is truly inspiring to all of us.”
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard had been reviewing its off-campus property to see how it fit with the University’s goals of supporting education and research. That review, along with conversations with athenahealth, led administrators to decide to sell the property.
“We were pleased to be able to accommodate the company’s expansion through this transaction, which is consistent with our review,” Galvin wrote.
The purchase is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot is different about the Harvard men’s basketball team this season, but one thing remains the same—the Crimson continues to have Boston College’s number.
Led by a career-high 21 points and six assists from rookie point guard Siyani Chambers, Harvard won its fifth straight over its intracity rival, 79-63, on Tuesday night.
Harvard (4-3) went into the break leading just 31-29 but dominated the second half, outscoring the Eagles (3-5) by 14.
Sophomore Wesley Saunders contributed 18 points and classmate Jonah Travis had 12 on the night to give the Crimson a dozen straight wins over Boston-area opponents.
“We mentioned to our kids that we just thought this was a moment—that if we could somehow play well here this evening, it would give us a little momentum as we move forward with our non-conference schedule,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “So I’m very pleased with our ballclub, with our effort in the second half. I thought the defense was outstanding.”
The Crimson scored the first eight points out of the break to begin a 26-7 run that expanded its lead to 20.
Saunders found junior co-captain Laurent Rivard for a right corner three to start the scoring. At the other end, Travis had a steal and ran the length of the court for a two-handed slam. Chambers then had a steal and finished an and-one layup to stretch the Crimson lead to 10 before Boston College’s Ryan Anderson—who led all scorers with 23 points—stopped the run with a dunk.
“I was just taking what the defense gave me,” Chambers said. “I was just trying to make plays for my teammates, and then [things] opened up for me.”
The Crimson offense continued to do what it wanted with ease as the half went on. After Anderson’s dunk, Harvard went on a 18-4 run that began when Rivard was fouled on a three-point attempt and hit all the ensuing free throws.
Chambers and sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi then executed a give-and-go off an inbounds play under the basket that led to a swooping lefty layup by the rookie. Following that, the point guard had a no-look transition pass to Saunders for a layup, Saunders found Moundou-Missi for a basket underneath, and Webster and Saunders hit back-to-back threes.
“Wesley [is] a do-it-all player for us,” Amaker said. “If he’s not the best all-around player in our league, he’s one of the very few in the conversation.”
Chambers capped the run by taking the Eagles’ Olivier Hanlan one-on-one, hitting a short floater over him, drawing the foul, and hitting the free-throw to extend Harvard’s lead to 57-37.
“I thought Siyani Chambers was magnificent,” Amaker said. “With his ball-handling, scoring, quarterbacking our team, he certainly didn’t play like a freshman. I’m very pleased with his progress [and] his performance. I thought he was the difference for us, without a doubt.”
Late in the game, Harvard extended its lead to 22 at 79-57 on an emphatic Chambers alley-oop to Travis and a Moundou-Missi tip-in. The Eagles ended the contest on a 6-0 run, but by then, Harvard was well on its way to its second-straight win.
“Even though they’re a BCS team [and] an ACC team...we’re trying to get better,” Amaker said. “Regardless of who we play, it’s going to be a meaningful game for us, as we’re trying to find a rhythm, find different options for our team, and grow as a team right now.”
Amaker tried to do just that on Tuesday night by implementing his second-straight new starting lineup, with this one featuring four perimeter players and Travis at center. Travis began the game with a short jumper and a layup, which was followed by a three from the right wing from co-captain Christian Webster and a short Saunders floater to give Harvard an early 9-6 lead.
The teams went back-and-forth for the majority of the half. The Crimson had a 9-0 run midway through that Saunders started with a jumper. Back-to-back blocks by rookie Agunwa Okolie at the other end led to a Rivard three and a Chambers transition jumper before a Webster layup put the Crimson up, 23-17.
The Eagles answered with a 7-1 run to tie the game with 5:05 to go, and the Crimson went into the break with a two-point lead. But Harvard controlled the game in the second half, helping it earn a double-digit win despite being outshot, 58.1 percent to 54.9 percent, from the floor.
“There’s a mental toughness on both sides of the ball that they had and we didn’t,” BC coach Steve Donahue said. “When you look at the box score, it’s kind of mind-boggling that you can put up those types of [shooting] numbers and lose so handily.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard women’s basketball team (7-2) and Providence fought a close battle for the lead for most of the Tuesday’s contest, the Crimson secured a comfortable lead in the final minutes, defeating the Friars, 73-59, at Lavietes Pavilion.
In the opening minutes of the game, the home team fell behind, scoring only four points by the 15th minute.
“[Providence] decided to use their athleticism,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “They were all over the passing lanes, all over the ball handlers, they were taking [junior Christine Clark] out of the game. They were very active, very athletic, very physical, and I felt that set us back on our heels in the first half.”
After a timeout, Harvard rallied and scored 12 points in a row to gain a four-point lead over the Friars. The scoring streak began with a shot just inside the arc from senior forward Victoria Lippert.
“I think we sort of just realized we didn’t have to be back on our heels,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we were trying to combat [Providence] with our quickness when we should have taken our time and had a little more control.”
Clark and sophomore guard Ali Curtis added other critical buckets during the Crimson run. Clark scored off a rebound, and Curtis drained a free throw and a three-pointer to bring the score difference to one point, forcing Providence to use its first timeout.
“The biggest challenge was really working our way back into the game and not giving up,” Clark said. “It’s really easy to get discouraged at that point because it’s so early and they’re up so much, and to fight back was tremendous.”
The Crimson defense helped to close the scoring gap with a series of blocks, most notably a double-team effort from Lippert and co-captain forward Miriam Rutzen with 10 minutes remaining. Harvard also racked up seven steals and forced 15 turnovers in the first period.
“We just have to keep playing us, and we did,” sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle said. “We just slowed it down, played our game, and tried to run offense as well as we could. Defense was the main thing for us, making those stops.”
With less than six minutes remaining in the first half the Friars ended the Crimson scoring streak and brought the score to a tie, 22-22.
With 40 seconds on the clock, the Friars took a one-point lead. After stealing the ball from Providence, junior center Elise Gordon scored a basket, but it came a fraction of a second after the buzzer, sending the Crimson into halftime down 28-27.
Heading into the second frame, Lippert led Harvard with 11 points, while the Friars’ Brianna Edwards registered 12 points. The Crimson shot 44 percent from the field and 60 percent from beyond the three-point arc, while Providence failed to shoot a single three-pointer during the first half of the game.
“It’s just a matter of getting our hearts and heads behind it and making it happen,” Delaney-Smith said.
The Friars scored the first field goal of the second half, which Clark immediately responded to with two points of her own.
Lippert then found Fagbenle who scored a right-handed layup, and when Providence returned to offense, Curtis stole the ball, which ended up in Lippert’s hands. After a give-and-go with Rutzen, the senior forward scored another two points, giving Harvard a one-point lead.
After several minutes of battling for the lead, the Crimson began to widen the scoring gap. Junior forward Missy Mullins made a steal and passed to Clark who found Fagbenle underneath the net. The play secured an eight-point lead for Harvard.
Rutzen made a block inside the paint to procure the Crimson’s 16th steal of the match. The turnover was followed by an on-target shot from Mullins, assisted by Lippert.
“I had a lot of faith that our defense was going to get stops, and it did,” Clark said. “It got us the win.”
In the final minute of the game, Clark drained a three-pointer to bring the final score to 73-57. The point guard finished the contest with a total of 17 points.
Other double-digit scorers included Fagbenle and Lippert who registered 15 points each. Lippert’s performance came after being selected by the Ancient Eight as this week’s Ivy League Player of the Week.
“I think our defense fostered our offense,” Delaney-Smith said. “That half court press we have really is a spark for us, and I think our offense got stronger and stronger [throughout the game]. We were trying to attack them back with some control, and that worked for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Tuesday night’s 79-63 victory over Boston College (3-5), the Harvard men’s basketball team (4-3) made it five straight against its crosstown rival from the Atlantic Coast Conference.
After the Eagles had come out on top of 32 of the teams’ first 41 matchups, Jeremy Lin ’10 changed the dynamic of the rivalry when he led the Crimson past the Eagles back in 2009. Since then, Harvard has made defeating Boston College an annual tradition.
“Certainly it’s very meaningful for us to have the opportunity to play our area teams, and we’ve been able to get excited about that,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It’s been very meaningful for us, and we’re thankful for the opportunity to play Boston College.”
Despite his team’s recent struggles against the Crimson, Eagles coach Steve Donahue has no plans of ending the annual matchup.
“I think it’s a game we should play,” Donahue said. “I think it’s the right thing for college basketball in the city of Boston…. I think people in this area are confused. They think it’s their father’s Harvard. It’s not. They’re an established program. They could beat a lot of basketball teams in this country, so for us to not play them because they might beat us, I would never do that.”
While much has been made of the Crimson’s winning streak against the Eagles, one Harvard newcomer was unaware of the Crimson’s recent successes against the Eagles.
“I didn’t know,” said rookie point guard Siyani Chambers, who posted a career-high 21 points. “It was just another game on the schedule.”
A FRESH FIVE
For the second straight game, Amaker decided to shake up the starting lineup.
After giving the starting nod to rookies Agunwa Okolie, Michael Hall, and Evan Cummins for the first time on Saturday, Amaker replaced the trio with co-captains Christian Webster and junior Laurent Rivard and sophomore Jonah Travis. The trio joined Chambers and sophomore Wesley Saunders, who have started every game for the Crimson this season.
“We’re thinking of different lineups based on our opponents and also feel by me, to be very honest,” said Amaker, who opened the season with a lineup of Chambers, Rivard, Saunders, and sophomores Steve Moundou-Missi and Kenyatta Smith. “We wanted to go with a veteran team [against Boston College].”
In addition to being its most experienced lineup, Tuesday’s five was also the Crimson’s smallest to open a game. Joined by four perimeter players, Travis was the Harvard’s tallest starter at 6’6”.
While the Crimson struggled defending the post in the early going—the Eagles scored 10 of their first 13 points in the paint—the decision to go small seemed to pay off.
After struggling to hold onto the ball in its past five contests, Harvard matched a season low with nine turnovers. The Crimson also had success in transition, scoring 15 fast-break points to Boston College’s four.
“They did a terrific job of attacking us when they had advantage and then making us guard them for 35 seconds,” Donahue said. “That’s the two hardest things to do in basketball is to push it early on and stop them and to have the poise and toughness and confidence at the end of the shot clock. They exploited both ends of that.”
Donahue was not surprised by Amaker’s decision to go small.
“That’s who I would have started against us,” Donahue said. “They’re the five best players in my opinion.”
THE RETURN OF THE NESTY
When the Crimson took the court at Conte Forum on Tuesday the squad met a familiar face.
After suiting up with the Crimson for three seasons, former Harvard forward Andrew van Nest ’12 is now playing out his final year of NCAA eligibility with the Eagles.
Van Nest, who is currently pursuing a graduate degree, has seen action in each of Boston College’s eight contests, averaging 5.7 points per game off the bench.
On Tuesday, van Nest posted four points on one-of-two shooting in nine minutes off the bench. After his first shot attempt was blocked, van Nest found the bottom of the net with 6:51 to play in the second half, finishing an and-one layup off a pick-and-roll. After knocking down the free throw, van Nest subbed out and did not return.
After the final buzzer, van Nest exchanged hugs with the Crimson players and coaching staff.
“I just spoke to him really quickly as the game concluded, but I’m very, very proud of what he’s been able to accomplish,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Happy Reading Period! Now that you don’t need to scurry around to lectures, sections and labs all day, what are you going to do with all your free time this week? Read? Yeah, right. Here are three Harvard athletic diversions to fill a lazy Reading Period day.
December 5: Men’s and women’s squash vs. Williams
Williams has nationally-ranked sports programs? What the Eph? The Williams men and women sit No. 12 and No. 10, respectively, in the College Squash Association’s national rankings. Amanda Sobhy, Ali Farag and the gang are nevertheless expected to make short work of their bovine opponents. The No. 3 Harvard men’s team shut out the Ephs 9-0 last year. The No. 1 Crimson women, meanwhile, have not yielded a match point to Williams since 2007.
December 7: Men’s basketball at UConn
Make a day trip out of your time off and hitch-hike your way to Storrs-Mansfield, Conn. While Tommy Amaker’s boys have their work cut out for them against the three-time NCAA Tournament champion program, the two teams share some interesting recent history. In the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament last season, Harvard indirectly defeated the Huskies, who lost to Central Florida in the semifinal game the day before the Crimson clinched the conch shell trophy. Two weeks later, UConn handed Harvard its first loss of the season after an 8-0 start.
In 2009, Jeremy Lin dropped a career-high 30 points on the Huskies in a 79-73 loss. The performance prompted a surprisingly foreboding comment on The Crimson’s game summary.
December 10: Men’s hockey vs. UMass-Lowell
The No. 20 Harvard men’s hockey team will meet a dangerous UMass-Lowell team Monday night at the Bright Hockey Center. The unranked River Hawks came within one win of a 2012 Frozen Four appearance and opened this year as the preseason No. 6. The nonconference opponents have not met since December 2001, back when “Family Affair” by Mary J. Blige topped the charts and Mario Lemieux graced the cover of NHL 2002.

Big banks and their army of lobbyists better watch out. News outlets reported Tuesday morning that U.S. Senator-elect Elizabeth Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor and champion of the liberal left, will likely be appointed to the Senate Banking Committee when she takes office in January.
Citing anonymous aides, the Huffington Post and the Boston Globe wrote that Warren's appointment to the prominent committee only awaits Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's formal announcement. Any appointment must also be voted on and approved by the incoming members of the Senate, but such approval is generally a mere formality. 
The chief overseer of the TARP bailout program and the intellectual force behind the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Warren has dedicated her career in academia and government to protecting consumers from fraud.
 Given her resume and national stature, Warren's potential appointment to the Banking Committee has not been without opposition. Republicans have spoken out against such an appointment, and reports have surfaced of financial industry lobbyists working actively against her appointment. 
Warren had taught at Harvard for more than 15 years until she defeated Republican U.S. Senator Scott Brown in November. During that race, backed by almost $40 million in campaign cash, Warren pledged to end Bush-era tax cuts on the rich, end tax loopholes for big business like the oil industry, and stiffen regulations on banks and businesses whose risky practices helped fuel the economic recession. 
Far from the fray of Washington, where Congress and White House are wrangling for a deal that would help avoid looming sequestration, Warren has spent much of the last week tour Massachusetts to thank voters and listen to their concerns.

This ginormous cockroach currently checking out the yummy offerings in the Adams dining hall dish return offers a lesson for us all.

It's not all that unusual to hear the Harvard name dropped on TV, but ABC's hit TV show "Revenge" just took it a little further with their mention of one of our more controversial institutions—the final club.
In a recent episode (appropriately titled "Lineage"), one of the show's many villains, Conrad Grayson, had some interesting advice for his son Daniel. "When Harvard finals clubs express an interest, you don't keep them waiting," he said. "Especially Phoenix, where you're a legacy."
Considering Daniel is only a freshman, Conrad's final club wisdom comes a bit premature!

Mariana Gudino Castañon '14 and Tyler Cusick '14 are both members of Adams House and co-organizers of the new initiative "Adams House Community Dinner Speeches." Through this initiative, the pair hope to strengthen House community by encouraging students to write short speeches about their personal experiences or convictions, then share their speeches with peers over dinner. Something similar has been done in Lowell House as well.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient  Eight (and other schools too).
Harvard may be (partially) responsible for Facebook, but that doesn't mean that other Ivies can't make their voices heard via various social media, both on- and off-line. This week, several of our peer institutions did just that.
Harvard students were baffled this week when Instagram pictures surfaced of YouTube sensations Glozell and Jenna Marbles palling around in Harvard apparel. What? While we at Flyby aren't quite sure, it seems it had something to do with YouTube's upcoming "Rewind". We'll keep you updated as this story develops.
Meanwhile, Yale students riffed on the rapidly growing "Compliments" trend with a new Facebook page entitled "Yale Condiments." Instead of tagging students with whom to exchange kind words, the administrators of the page tag popular dining hall condiments. One post reads: "Dear Cholula Hot Sauce, I love the way you turn the heat up, your warm flavors meld so nicely  onto my tongue. You know how to spice up any situation. Call me?" It seems Yale really has beat us to the punch this time.
But there are other kinds of "social." As for intimate interpersonal interaction, it seems to be getting rarer and rarer on college campuses these days. The 'Cac blog reports that Bowdoin, Connecticut College, and Tufts have all recently had Primal Scream-like events canceled. Luckily Colgate has decided to inaugruate its own Primal Scream this year, though the Facebook event description does not indicate that nudity is in the cards. What's so primal about screaming with your clothes on?
Finally, Brown's Blog Daily Herald reported that Penn alums are looking to assert their school's position as the "Social Ivy" by starting a new social organization called, well, "The Social Ivy" that will partially sponsor meals for the coolest of the cool Penn students. The website's FAQ section reads: "We want to unite the Penn community, and give friends an excuse to  get together." But there's a catch! Just as in the college admissions process, you can't get in without taking a test. According to the site, "Alumni want to unite the best and only the best. The Social Ivy  ensures that the students who get together to share ideas and have a  good time are not only cool and interesting, but also smart and  informed." We at Flyby think everyone at our school is smart and informed. It looks like the same can't be said for Penn.
