After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Soyoung Lee became the new Chief Curator of the Harvard Art Museums this September. Lee was born in Jakarta, Indonesia, and has lived all over the world in cities like Stockholm, London, Los Angeles, Seoul, Tokyo, and most recently, New York. She earned her B.A., M.A., and Ph.D in Art History from Columbia University, and Lee worked previously at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for 15 years, where she served as curator, associate curator, and assistant curator in their Asian Art Department. At the HAM, Lee will oversee three curatorial divisions: Asian and Mediterranean Art, European and American Art, and Modern and Contemporary Art. Additionally, Lee will have responsibilities in the exhibition program and in developing Harvard’s world-class collections. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Lee about how she has transitioned into working at the Harvard Art Museums.
The Harvard Crimson: After working at a museum such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, what led you to be interested in working at the Harvard Art Museums?
Soyoung Lee: I had been the curator primarily of Korean art and the Asian art collections for quite some time, 15 years at the Met. That means, as a curator, you have your independent purview. You get to do a lot of research, exhibitions, etc. But this new role offers an exciting new opportunity and challenge for me because it means that I make decisions that are of importance to the institution as a whole. You’re no longer thinking just about yourself and your own projects but about the entire institution. I am questioning, “What is the role of a museum like the Harvard Art Museums,” “What are the kinds of exhibitions that we might want to display,” and “How do we want to continue to build our collection?” It is my role to think deeply about these big picture questions, strategies, programming, and directions for the institution. This kind of thinking made this a truly irresistible opportunity.
THC: What changes do you envision yourself making at the Harvard Art Museums?
SL: I’m now only about two months into the job so it’s still early, but right now what I’m interested in is really listening and finding out the full history of the museums and where the current staff feels we are and where we ought to go. I think HAM is really good in its role within the University — what it does for its students and how it works with the faculty. But I also think there’s a bigger role to be played locally, regionally, perhaps even nationally and internationally. I think Harvard as a university is a global brand — it has incredible global reach and impact, and I believe the Harvard Art Museums should aspire to be on that level as well. I would just like to push us to think a bit more globally and internationally in terms of our presence and our impact.
THC: Having lived in so many different countries, how do you feel that background has influenced the way you view and interact with art?
SL: My background stems from the fact that my father was a diplomat for South Korea. His job took our family all over, so from a very young age I lived in many different countries and, though I wasn’t necessarily aware of art at such an early age, I was exposed to it. My father’s work was about cultural promotion and he dealt very much with promoting Korean art and culture, particularly through the press. So from an early age I was conscious of what it meant to present a story or a culture through the arts. Living in different parts of the world has not only opened my eyes to those cultures, it has made me view my role as a curator similar to that of an ambassador: It is translation work.
THC: Given your extensive background in Asian art, Korean ceramics in particular, are you hoping to push the collection of Asian art at HAM in any particular direction?
SL: I would love to see the Asian art collection continue to grow, and that is not at odds with how the museum is thinking in general. I want to encourage us to think more holistically about the significant moments of a particular period or culture, and how to best represent the strengths of a culture. For example, our Japanese collection is quite strong in its painting tradition, but Japan is a culture well known for its decorative arts or traditions such as the tea ceremony, and we are somewhat weaker in representing that area. There are of course practicalities and realities of the market and what is possible and acquirable, but within those boundaries, I hope to really look at a collection and balance the current interests of today’s generation with the future.
Also, because I was a Korean art curator, there may be an expectation that I’m coming in to expand its Korean collection, but I would like to do that judiciously. Given my expertise, where there is opportunity, I would certainly like to make sure that that’s part of the growing narrative of this place. And given that we don’t have a curator for Korean art, and we’re also looking for a curator for Chinese art, that’s an area that I will take an interest in. I would be really happy to provide expertise where I am able to do so. In a way, that is what makes this job so irresistible: I get to retain my expertise and bring that to where it’s needed, but then there’s also the bigger purview that makes it so exciting.
THC: What do you consider the most important component of curating an exhibition?
SL: There is no one part in curating an exhibition. Though I will say, without great art the whole thing does not hold. So artwork is the core, but then you need the right concept to pull a storyline together. The selection of the works needs to be balanced with the presentation. Just because you might have 50 masterpieces does not mean you have a great exhibition. To make a truly compelling, thought-provoking, perhaps even thought-changing exhibition, you need a mode of presentation that people will understand. It is very conceptual and also very creative — it requires a kind of visualization that is very different from just putting things into words. That is one of the most appealing and challenging things about curating an exhibition because it requires many different parts of your brain.
THC: How do you grapple with trying to appeal to such a wide audience as a museum curator?
SL: Here, the Harvard community is the core, but there’s a wide range of people coming, and that is one of the biggest challenges in thinking about how to put together an exhibition. We must ask not only “What is the undergraduate going to get out of it,” but also, “What is the visitor from China going to get out of it? What about the art lover in Boston, or the artist coming up from New York?” Sometimes you cannot capture everyone. And the danger is that in trying to make it something for everyone, the exhibition will get diluted. But the trick is to layer it so that there’s a message or a takeaway for different parts of the audience.
THC: If you had to choose one piece of art from the HAM to have in your home, which one would it be?
SL: It would be this Korean vase that is not on view right now. I have known about it because the collector who gave it to Harvard was also a donor at the Met. It is an 18th century porcelain jar with a dragon, a cobalt blue and white painted dragon jar. It’s not unique, many collections have them, but there’s something about this jar… the dragon is more comical than imperial, and there’s a great energy about it that’s very approachable. The other reason is that if I took it home I could actually touch it. The one regret I have about things like ceramics being in a museum is that they can only be experienced visually. With paintings or many two-dimensional objects, that’s the intent. But objects like ceramics are meant to be handled. So you really experience a ceramic object both through looking, and if you can’t handle it and touch it, you can’t get the full experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

American poet Allen Ginsberg’s “Kaddish for Naomi Ginsberg” refers to the traditional Jewish prayer recited in memory of the dead. In the next week, a new, original adaptation of Ginsberg’s poem, directed by inactive arts editor Eli Zuzovsky ’21, will premiere at the Loeb Ex thanks to the cast of HRDC.
Zuzovsky did not embark upon the task of adapting Ginsberg’s masterpiece lightly. “The challenge is that the text is not chronological. There are multiple leaps in time because it’s all about memory and the way we remember the people we love,” Zuzovsky says. To adapt this multi-layered, textured poem, Zuzovsky employs a variety of artistic and theatrical elements meant to convey chronology and meaning.
The show follows Allen Ginsberg (John R. Creed ’19) as he interacts with four different Naomi Ginsbergs, each embodying a different element of her memory through Allen’s consciousness. “As the show progresses, we flow in and out of various memories and plot points,” Katie R. McClanan ’22 says, who plays one iteration of Naomi. Through these interactions, the audience sees Ginsberg grappling with issues he faced in his relationship with his mother and how mental health issues affected their interactions.
The show attempts to examine mental illness through Naomi, who was never properly diagnosed and spent much of Ginsberg’s youth in mental hospitals. “He had to take care of her since the age of 12 and step up to be her parent, in a way,” Zuzovsky says. Other themes find themselves intertwined within the show, including Ginsberg’s stance on homosexuality in a time when it was illegal in every U.S. state.
“The show is shining a light on how art can help people to process their grief.” Creed says. It does so not by creating a new pice, but by drawing upon a potent example of bereavement and breathing new life into the story on the stage.
“Kaddish” will run on Nov. 30, Dec. 1, Dec. 2, Dec. 6, Dec. 7, Dec. 8 at 8 p.m., and on Dec. 8 at 2 p.m.

Welsh multi-instrumentalist and singer-songwriter Ali Lacey, better known as “Novo Amor,” took to the stage at The Sinclair in Harvard Square on Nov. 17. Cambridge was the fourth stop in Novo Amor’s sold-out North American tour for his debut solo record “Birthplace.”


This tour is Novo Amor’s first ever in North America. His music bridges the genres of indie rock and folk music, making recognizable use of vocal falsetto and chordal simplicity.


Rachel Baldwin, an indie folk singer-songwriter and Boston local, opened the show for Novo Amor (above).


Throughout the evening, Novo Amor performed songs from “Birthplace” and his previous albums, including “Heiress” — his collaborative album with English producer and songwriter Ed Tullet, who he brought on his tour (above).


The concert included a performance of Terraform, one of Novo Amor and Tullet’s most popular songs from “Heiress.” The song’s title means to transform a planet so as to resemble the earth, especially so that it can support human life. Terraform’s music video features the unaltered story of an actual Indonesian sulfur miner of the active volcano Kawah Ijen, who braves dangerous heat and toxic gases to provide for his family. The video, directed by Sil Van Der Woerd, won over a dozen short film awards.
This use of atmospheric soundscapes and storytelling imagery is pervasive in Novo Amor’s work. His record “Birthplace” sheds light on the issue of plastic pollution in the world’s oceans. The music video of his titular single “Birthplace,” a cinematic rendering of a man walking underwater among ocean life and ultimately being engulfed by plastic waste, won Best Video at the 2018 Association of Independent Music Awards. His vinyl records for Birthplace are also made from recycled material, making each individual record unique in color and hue. 

 
Novo Amor ended the concert with the song “From Gold,” originally written as the score for one of his friend’s feature films. The writing of “From Gold,” he said, ultimately inspired his debut EP, Woodgate, NY, which was released in 2014 and became in some ways the start of his musical endeavors as Novo Amor.

It’s hard to know what to make of Julius Avery’s “Overlord.” On the one hand, it is an entertaining film that effectively blends action and horror elements to create a memorable film experience. On the other hand, the blend of hyper-realistic war scenes and supernatural elements can lead to confusion as one wonders what kind of movie “Overlord” is trying to be. Still, despite that confusion, watching “Overlord” makes for a (very) bloody good time.
On the eve of D-Day, a group of soldiers, including reluctant Boyce (Jovan Adepo) and battle-hardened Ford (Wyatt Russell), are tasked with bringing down a German-controlled radio tower behind enemy lines. Outnumbered and pinned down, the company soon discovers a secret Nazi experiment, supernatural forces, and find themselves in a situation far more dangerous than they could have ever imagined.
In a society saturated with zombies and war films like “The Walking Dead,” “Dunkirk,” and “Saving Private Ryan,” it is impressive that “Overlord” manages to distinguish itself with some truly unique and outstanding scenes scattered throughout the film. The first scene, spanning the first 10 minutes of the film, is one of the most intense in recent years. As the soldiers’ transport plane flies into enemy territory, it is met with a barrage of heavy German artillery. The ensuing chaos, as the soldiers attempt to survive the barrage and parachute to the ground, is unrelenting, heart-pounding, and horrifying in a way similar to the Normandy invasion depicted in “Saving Private Ryan.” The film is instantly engaging and the suddenness of the onslaught helps pack the following scenes with tension by setting the precedent that chaos can ensue at any time.
Additionally, while the war elements are plenty horrifying, elements of classic horror present themselves to great effect when the soldiers come face to face with the results of the Nazi experiment. The film relies on unsettling imagery and tense moments to create fear, which are highly effective and truly scary. An expertly written scene, in which a character is exposed to an experimental treatment which causes him to mutate, is highly disturbing as the tension builds to a shocking climax. Ultimately, “Overlord” cleverly blends action and horror to create an entertaining movie from start to finish.
The film is also bolstered by strong writing and well-rounded characters. The dialogue flows and nothing feels clunky. There is little to no exposition, and the audience learns about the situation along with the characters as new developments present themselves. By the end of the film, there is still relatively little information presented on the nature of the Nazi experiments. This may seem like a negative, but the lack of information bolsters the mystery of the circumstances and keeps the narrative compelling throughout. The characters themselves all have interesting personalities, and no character remains static. Even the less relevant characters experience some development throughout the narrative, which keeps them interesting and worth watching.
However, despite the film’s strengths, there is still something that feels off about it. While it is hard to pin down exactly what that thing is, the most likely culprit is a lack of understanding about the nature of the film prior to its viewing. The trailer for the film, featuring undead soldiers (reminiscent of the “Call of Duty” zombies), gunfire, and flamethrowers set to AC/DC’s “Hell’s Bells,” strongly suggest that the film would be a relatively simple, action-packed zombie movie. However, after witnessing the horrifyingly brutal first 10 minutes, it is very clear that this is not the case. This can leave viewers initially disoriented and confused as to what “Overlord” is striving to be. It takes a long time for any zombies to show up, and it’s almost disappointing once they do, as the film has already strongly established itself as a capable war drama.
This confusion could largely be avoided if it were clearer from the beginning what type of film “Overlord” really is. It is not a zombie movie. It is a war movie that has zombies. This distinction is represented in the film’s title, which, at first glance, could easily be interpreted as referring to a ruler, perhaps in reference to whatever entity has spurred the creation of the zombies. However, when the credits roll and there hasn’t been any trace of an overlord, it’s easy to feel underwhelmed and confused.
The title, however, most likely refers to Operation Overlord, the codename for the Allied operation that launched the invasion of German-occupied Europe during World War II. The events of the film comprise the fictionalized first mission of Operation Overlord. Following this distinction, it is much more accurate to view the film as a war movie containing supernatural elements and creatures. Anyone expecting this film to involve American soldiers gunning down hordes of zombies with machine guns will be largely disappointed.
Overall, “Overlord” is a well-written, entertaining film with some truly unique and memorable scenes. Though it suffers from a misleading advertising campaign, those who approach it with the right mindset should find it a highly enjoyable experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The undergraduate members of the Institute of Politics recently elected its first all-female executive board in more than a decade. Anna L. Duffy ’21 and Maya Jenkins ’21 won their uncontested race for president and vice president, respectively, while Olivia M. Ferdinand ’21 was elected treasurer and Grace K. Bannister ’21 won the election for communications director.
We are glad to see the diversity that this new executive board represents, as the current IOP executive board is poised to represent female voices on our campus. Still, for true diversity to reach the IOP, institutional channels must change so the presence of members of historically underrepresented groups in leadership is not an anomaly, but a norm.
Institutions — particularly academic ones — tend to uphold short-lived examples of diversity while not altering the processes that have historically blocked women and minorities from holding leadership positions. We hope that students, particularly those on this campus and in the IOP, change their organizations such that increased diversity in leadership no longer makes headlines.
The problem of diversity within the IOP specifically has been longstanding; the one once-in-a-decade election of an all-female board does not change this fact. That being said, Duffy has stated that the new executives will conduct outreach to on-campus groups to promote diversity within the IOP. We hope the new executive board follows through on this promise, in addition to taking other concrete steps to promote greater representation within the IOP.
Still, change can only occur if those in power are determined to make it. While the symbolism of an all-female executive board is significant, we are concerned the day-to-day operations of the IOP may not significantly alter to welcome members of more diverse backgrounds and identities — and concrete change surely requires more than symbolism. Student leaders at the IOP should take initiative to make their organization a more supportive place for students from historically underrepresented groups in particular.
One of the more promising features of this new executive board is its commitment to, as Ferdinand said, “strengthen pathways to careers in public service.” As we have previously opined, public service has been largely overlooked at the College over the years. Even University President Lawrence S. Bacow has recognized the need for more resources for students seeking public service careers by promising to fund public service internships for every undergraduate interested in such a position. We commend the IOP’s new executive board for taking steps to improve the accessibility and feasibility of public service to students.
We congratulate the IOP on its all-female leadership and await the plans that the new executives have in store for the organization. And we hope that one day, we will no longer need to call such an election newsworthy. We hope that one day, greater representation will simply be the status quo.

Two weeks ago, the Harvard College undergraduate body voted overwhelmingly in favor of two referenda urging the University to divest its endowment from holdings in the fossil fuel industry and the “prison-industrial complex.” These two industries are among the most heinous imaginable, benefiting from the burning of fuels that severely exacerbate the warming of our climate and excessive incarceration, respectively. Harvard should sever all ties from these industries and should follow the voices of its students.
Fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas are by far the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and in the world. Aside from possibly deforestation, there is nothing humans have ever done that comes close to fossil fuels in the massive harm wreaked on our planet. Though recycling and buying local produce are important, climate change cannot be stopped by consumers. It can only be stopped by targeting and punishing those directly responsible for it. The burden ought to fall on the unethical corporations that have benefited from destroying our climate.
Similarly, the prison-industrial complex profits from and contributes to one of the most odious problems in our country, and it ought to be vigorously opposed. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the number of incarcerated people has increased by around 600 percent to 2.3 million since 1970 and, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice, there is no evidence of a correlation between crime rates and incarceration rates. The criminal justice system at almost every level — policing, pretrial detaining, plea bargaining, convicting, sentencing, and releasing — disproportionately impacts blacks and Latinos. Incarcerated people often work in conditions reminiscent of slavery, such as when inmates recently worked as firefighters in the recent California wildfires. For these reasons and many more, activists have begun to call the American criminal justice system “modern-day slavery,” a form of racial and socioeconomic caste system, and “the new Jim Crow.” 
History will not look favorably upon those who benefited from mass incarceration and climate change. By maintaining its investments in these industries, Harvard is undoubtedly placing itself on the wrong side of history. Unfortunately, there is little that any of us as individuals can do to stop these two colossal injustices. That is why radical, systemic change is necessary. And that is why Harvard should take the lead — economically as well as academically and politically — in fighting for a more just world.
Critics, such as The Harvard Crimson Editorial Board, upon which I sit, argue that if the Harvard Management Corporation were to adopt divestment policies, it would effect little financial change and have “no ability to effect social change.” This line of thinking is severely misguided for several reasons.
Even if it were true that the divestment of select investments from a $39.2 billion endowment does not exert serious financial pressure on the affected industries, which is indiscernible until implemented, the symbolic value of Harvard taking a stand against the private prison and fossil fuel industries cannot be understated. If Harvard were to publicly condemn, and divest from, these industries, many institutions would surely follow. It would also send an unequivocal message that Harvard “walks the walk” when it comes to protecting our planet and justice for all.
Yet, even if it were true that Harvard’s potential divestment would not affect any change, either symbolic or financial, which I do not believe is the case, Harvard nonetheless ought to divest from these industries. Entanglement with fossil fuel and the prison-industrial complex taints Harvard’s moral character and such entanglement is wrong in itself.
It is flawed to judge the morality of an action simply by its consequences. For example, it would be wrong for Harvard to donate money to the National Rifle Association, even if such a donation did not lead to any legislation or an increase in gun deaths. Likewise, it is fallacious to analyze Harvard’s holdings in fossil fuel or private prison corporations strictly in terms of their impact.
There has been great opposition to Harvard accepting donations from unethical people, institutions, and countries. I greatly sympathize with these concerns. These donations are worrisome not just because they tarnish Harvard’s research and reputation but because accepting this money is intrinsically dubious.
Yet the issue of investing in immoral industries certainly ought to be just as problematic as accepting money. If Harvard would not accept money from the fossil fuel and prison industries, then why should it essentially be giving them money? Surely, supporting immoral industries is worse than being supported by them.
The endowment is not a wholly separate entity, but rather an integral component to Harvard’s mission. Harvard should strive to be a moral institution that cares for our planet and our fellow human beings. Doing so requires the complete and immediate divestment of its endowment from the fossil fuel industry and the prison-industrial complex. Harvard’s integrity is at stake.

Last semester, one of my professors mentioned Google’s Deep Dream within a list of computer programs that use artificial intelligence to do normal human activities — like playing chess, Go, or Atari Breakout — better than any human can. It’s been decades since a world-class chess player first lost to a computer, so I’m not surprised by computers that can predict winning moves based on the rules of a game. But Deep Dream stood out from the list. Instead of winning games, or doing anything else that I’d expect from a computer, it creates art.
I’ve always thought of art as inherently human, tapping into undefinable emotions and experiences, something that can’t be replicated by an unfeeling machine. Computers may have the same or greater capacity than people for applying game theory to develop strategies, solving math problems, recognizing faces, and even driving cars — but creativity seems untouchable. At best, I believed, a computer might become a feeble impersonation of a human artist.
Deep Dream is far from a feeble impersonation, though. It doesn’t copy human art, or try to imitate a particular artistic style. Instead, it’s trained to identify specific patterns (the way facial recognition software can identify faces), and it alters images by repeatedly enhancing any qualities remotely similar to those patterns. For example, a version of Deep Dream trained to identify dogs saturates the starting images with thousands of dog-like features — tails, ears, snouts, fur, legs — until they’re almost unrecognizable, transformed into endless canine fractals, sprouting from the skeletons of the original images.
This program doesn’t seem like a flimsy ruse of creativity. Deep Dream’s outputs are psychedelic, innovative, and entirely unlike art produced by humans. It’s a form of genuine creativity that exploits the pattern recognition processes computers are good at, uncovering wildly inventive interpretations of an input, with very little human control over how the output will look. And the world is beginning to recognize such computer programs as art. Paintings generated by artificial intelligence have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and studies have shown that these paintings are indistinguishable from (and even preferred over) some of the most renowned modern masterpieces.
Machine creativity is an exciting development, but it’s also incredibly unsettling. The recent explosion of artificial intelligence has provoked intense debate over the possibility that robots could take over our jobs. Whether or not these fears are founded, they reveal a deeper insecurity about whether human skills and intelligence are unique. Even creativity, which seems like our most human characteristic, faces a stunning challenge from artificial intelligence. It’s plausible that the greatest masterpieces of the coming centuries will be made by artificial intelligence, that these works of art will fill museum walls and auction houses, that profits reaped by computer programs will outstrip human artists’ earnings.
But this challenge doesn’t have to be unsettling, and it shouldn’t compel us to delegitimize machine creativity. Instead, it’s an invitation to reexamine why we value art and creativity in the first place. Machine creativity is only a threat to human art if we view art strictly as a commodity, judged by its economic value. Computers can’t compete with humans if, instead, we place value on the experience and process of making art, regardless of whether it becomes a lucrative masterpiece.
In general, art is treated much more as a commodity than an experience. We only learn to appreciate art that’s expensive and famous, created by an elite group of experts. And we don’t push kids to pursue art unless we believe their innate talents compare to those of experts. Unlike math or writing, art is rarely offered (let alone required) in schools, rarely considered a fruitful way to learn and grow regardless of skill level. It’s only valuable for people with professional aspirations, since the experience of making art doesn’t constitute a payoff in and of itself.
Even at Harvard, a place that ostensibly celebrates art, it’s blatantly inaccessible to make art for its own sake. Studio art classes are notoriously scarce and competitive, with dozens of students vying for at most 15 slots, and priority given to those who already study art. There aren’t many non-academic opportunities to create art, either. Few clubs or organizations revolve around the visual arts. And only a small fraction of Harvard’s students can get involved in events like Arts First, which seeks to promote art in the greater Harvard community. The average student is encouraged to view and listen to the art, music, and plays, but can’t participate in creating them.
Excluding non-artists from making art denies us of experiences that could shape our studies and ourselves, even if our art wouldn’t be seen as conventionally valuable. For example, an engineering student could take an art class to refine their design sense. An English student could experiment with a new medium for storytelling. Biology students could develop creative visual representations of natural processes. Anyone and everyone could become better visual thinkers and more effective communicators by studying art.
We fail to do justice to human creativity when we neglect art’s ability to enrich our daily lives. By only valuing art as a commodity, by only validating the most popular artists, we inadvertently exclude the vast majority of people from participating in art, sending the message that nothing we create could be worthwhile. But human creativity stands apart from machine creativity, not because humans can generate more soulful masterpieces and steady profits, but because it’s available to everyone. We can all make art that enhances our study of other fields, spreads compassion for other people, and helps us engage with our surroundings and ourselves. Ultimately, it’s everything that we learn from the experience, rather than the outcome, that makes humans unique. And art is one of the most overlooked and powerful ways for anyone and everyone to exercise this creativity.

Harvard Management Company announced Sanjeev Daga will take the management of the University’s $39.2 billion endowment as the firm’s chief operating officer starting in February.
Daga comes from Columbia University Investment Management Company, the group that oversees Columbia University's endowment, where he holds the same position. The chief operating officer is one of HMC’s three most senior leadership positions. N.P. "Narv" Narvekar, CEO of the Harvard Management Company, also previously managed Columbia’s endowment, working directly with Daga for more than a decade.
Robert A. Ettl, the current COO of HMC, is retiring after 10 years at the firm. He served as interim CEO of HMC prior to Narvekar’s arrival in December 2016.
“I am excited for the opportunity to join HMC and build on the work that Narv and the team have undertaken over the last two years,” Daga said in a Harvard Gazette article. “I look forward to meeting with members of the team in the coming months and learning about the challenges and opportunities ahead, so that I can hit the ground running in February.”
The move comes as HMC announced in September that it returned 10 percent on its investments in fiscal year 2018, a gain Narvekar announced he was "not pleased" with. Harvard’s returns lagged behind its Ivy League peers, finishing only ahead of Columbia.
Daga graduated from Rutgers University and received his MBA from New York University. He previously worked in risk management for two international banks.
“I had the pleasure of working with Sanjeev for more than 13 years at CIMC and we are thrilled that he will be joining the team,” Narvekar told the Gazette. “His experience building and managing an extraordinary operations and IT effort at a leading endowment will be a great asset as we continue our organizational transition.”
Charles A. Skorina, the head of a finance executive search firm, said HMC’s chief operating officer position involves “middle office” tasks like risk management, as well as “back office” duties like administrative oversight.
“In Harvard’s case in particular, you’ve got back and middle office relationships,” he said. “You have an awful lot of due diligence and review, because every manager that you put money with you have to review that manager.”
Skorina also said it is common for endowment heads to bring over people they have previously worked with. As part of the announcement, HMC also said Kevin F. Shannon, the group’s chief financial officer, is retiring. The position may be folded into existing management structure, according to the Gazette article.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A coalition of 10 Harvard Law School student affinity groups called on Dean John F. Manning ‘82 to establish a Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity in a letter published Monday in the Harvard Law Record, the school’s student publication.
The coalition wrote that they would ultimately like to see the school open a distinct office to address concerns about diversity, inclusion, and equity, created by this committee.
“We call on Dean Manning to establish a Harvard Law School Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity (“Committee”) charged with designing an Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity (“Office”); tracking implementation and progress on the Office; and monitoring the wellbeing of students until one year after the operation of the Office,” the letter states.
The letter was signed by the Affinity Group Coalition, a group of Law School student affinity groups including the Black Law Students Association, the Executive Board of the Women’s Law Association, and La Alianza — the Law School’s Latinx student organization.
The coalition criticized the administration’s response to student recommendations made in an addendum to a 2017 report from the Task Force on Academic Community and Student Engagement. Commissioned by former Law School Dean Martha L. Minow following protests in 2016, the task force looked at Law students’ experience at the school in four areas: institutional culture, curriculum, mentoring, and institutional supports.
“HLS has failed to implement a majority of the recommendations, including the development of a Critical Race Theory program and hosting public town halls to address HLS norms and culture,” the letter states, in references to the addendum’s recommendations.
Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells wrote in an emailed statement that the school has created a number of new mentoring and advising initiatives in the past year such as a new online platform to help students connect with each other, a pre-orientation course for incoming first-year students, and a preferred lender program for student loans.
“The Law School has long had an unwavering commitment to creating a strong and inclusive community that is diverse along multiple dimensions,” Sells wrote. “We will continue to meet with all students, faculty, and staff to further deepen our sense of community.”
In their letter, the coalition also outlined how they envision the committee to be structured. They proposed that the committee be made up of a combination of faculty, staff, and students and focus on issues like diversity, pedagogy, and culture.
Demarquin D. Johnson, a second-year Law student and one of the letter’s authors, said the Law School needs to do a better job understanding these issues.
“Currently, the Law School is unable to recognize the importance of diversity, inclusion, and equity in every aspect of it,” Johnson said. “It’s not only important in the recruitment side, it’s also important in the way that faculty are teaching in the classroom, it’s important when you think about the alumni, it’s important when you think about the finances, it’s important when you think about the Law School experience.”
Johnson added that it was critical that a new office be devoted to these issues.
“It can not be simplified into just like a back office in the Dean of Students Office because it needs its own office,” Johnson said.
Lauren D. Williams, a third-year Law student and president of the Black Law Students Association, said her organization’s main concern was the lack of a consistent faculty position dedicated to teaching critical race theory.
“I have been here for three years and there hasn’t been someone on staff consistently teaching a course like Critical Race Theory and we’ve definitely been pushing,” Williams said.
Williams also said that other schools have similar committees, pointing to the University of Chicago Law School’s Diversity Committee as one example.
“As kind of a pioneering space in the academy, HLS — there’s no reason why they shouldn't get in front of this too,” Williams said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two historically deadly wildfires began to devastate cities in Northern and Southern California in early November, worrying undergraduates from throughout the state as they watched the unpredictable firestorm wreak havoc from thousands of miles away.
The most recent reports indicate that both the “Camp Fire” in Northern California and the “Woolsey Fire” in Southern California are 100 percent contained, after raging for several weeks.
Brenden T. Rodriquez ’20, a native of Agoura Hills, said his family lost their home to the Woolsey Fire in Southern California. A day after the fire started, his family was forced to evacuate, asking Rodriquez what he wanted from the house and bringing all they could carry, but ultimately not taking a lot.
“Growing up in California, you’re used to wildfires. I’ve seen some from my house off in the distance where you can see the flames,” he said. “But you were never really worried that it was actually going to come through, so I think that subconsciously they were like ‘We’re going to evacuate and then we’re going to come back eventually,’ and that just didn’t happen.”
Rodriquez said it was difficult being thousands of miles away during the storm. Though, he noted he was grateful to travel back to California this Thanksgiving and sift through what was left of his childhood home.
“That was actually really soothing, getting to go through everything. I wanted to find at least one thing that was recognizable that I could take with me” he said.
The wildfires have damaged more than 250,000 acres of land and destroyed tens of thousands of structures in both parts of the state, leaving thousands of Californians homeless. In Northern California, 85 people have died and hundreds more remain unaccounted for.
Suffering some of the most extreme damage, the city of Paradise was leveled, making the Camp Fire California’s deadliest and most destructive wildfire to date. In Southern California, the Woosley Fire forced residents throughout the region to evacuate immediately. The fire started less than a day after the Thousand Oaks Shooting took 12 people's lives in that same area.
Rodriquez said he was grateful for the administrators and professors who reached out to him, as well as his fellow students who provided support throughout the past couple of weeks. In a discussion with a blockmate, Rodriquez said he offhandedly mentioned that he wished he had brought his record player to Cambridge before the fire. Soon after, his blockmate organized a fundraiser to replace the record player he had lost.
“I’ve been very thankful to have found families here that were very helpful,” he said. “It was just nice to know there were people here too as well as back home.”
Air quality throughout California has also deteriorated due to the blaze. In recent weeks, Northern California had the worst air quality in the world, according to Purple Air, an air monitoring network. Olivia A. Sison ’21 said while no buildings have burned down in her hometown of Sacramento, the extremely hazardous air quality worried her family. Due to the wildfires, the Bay Area issued public health warnings, residents were urged not to go outside, and many schools, businesses, and universities shuttered their doors.
“It was pretty traumatic seeing how smogy the air was and that you couldn’t even see the buildings anymore,” Sison said. “That was really really frightening because my whole family is there and I obviously don’t want them breathing in these particles that are carcinogenic.”
“It was a very hopeless feeling just being here and not being able to physically be there,” she continued.
As Thanksgiving break approached, the fires began to abate, but Sison and Justin D. Mack ’22 both did not spend Thanksgiving at their homes in Northern California. Mack, a Los Altos native, said instead of going back home for Thanksgiving, members of his family came to Boston to celebrate with local relatives and escape the smog.
“The closest fire [to Los Altos] was the Camp Fire, which is 200 miles to the north almost, and it still had a huge disruption of daily life for them,” Mack said.
The wildfires have served as flashpoints for numerous national debates, including climate change, California’s housing crisis, inmate labor, and the ethics of hiring private firefighters for personal protection.
In relation to the housing crisis, Sison pointed towards the amount of fundraising she has seen on Facebook.
“It was incredibly sad to see all the GoFundMe’s on Facebook trying to make up for what had been lost.” she said. “It’s sad that we don’t have anything in place to actually help these people other than GoFundMe accounts.”
When discussing the aftermath, Rodriquez said that his family is planning to rebuild.
“I think the the community is going to come back even stronger than it was before, and it’s kind of a tough time to be in the Valley right now with the shooting and the fire right after, but I was blessed to not have lost anyone,” he said. “Family comes first, you can replace things, like every physical thing is going to be replaced, but you can’t replace family.”
Rodriquez said he optimistically points to a favorite movie quote — from the 2008 film “Bottle Shock” — when he thinks about the disaster.
“We’re all a little stronger in the broken places,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Immediately following Harvard graduate students’ vote to unionize, some experts predicted the move would have a ripple effect on other universities. Months after the April election, that prediction appears to have come to fruition as unions at peer institutions have won elections and bargaining rights.
Eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants voted to authorize Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’s petition to bargain on their behalf last April. Eleven days later, Harvard administrators announced they would bargain in good faith with the union, breaking with leaders at peer institutions that chose not to recognize graduate unions on their campuses.
Now — after an uncertain start at the beginning of the academic year — several unions have followed in HGSU-UAW’s footsteps, securing historic gains in their own fights for better wages and benefits.
At three universities — Tufts University, the New School, and Brandeis University — graduate student unions successfully negotiated their first contracts this month. And at two other schools — Brown University and Georgetown University — eligible student employees voted to unionize.
Avram L. Reisman, an organizer for the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees, wrote in an email that GAGE’s past successes and future plans have been influenced by the work of unions at peer institution.
“GAGE will work to ensure that the first contract represents the movement that has coalesced in support of unionization,” he wrote. “We will certainly look to the examples of successful first contracts for guidance moving forward.”
“As more and more stories like GAGE get attention, more unionization efforts will start and, hopefully, succeed,” Reisman added.
At Columbia University — where the original 2016 National Labor Relations Board precedent which allows graduate students to unionize was decided — the graduate union has also made recent headway.
Columbia administrators refused to recognize the union after a successful vote held in Dec. 2017. At the time, they said the teaching and research assistants included in the proposed bargaining unit were primarily students, not workers, and thus did not have the right to collectively bargain over wages and benefits — an argument which several universities, including Harvard, have repeated in the past.
This refusal prompted members of the Graduate Workers of Columbia-UAW to authorize a strike, walking picket lines during the final week of their spring semester. This fall, after GWC-UAW members threatened to strike again, Columbia agreed to bargain under a framework proposed jointly by the university and the UAW.
Though GWC-UAW members still have to vote to approve the framework, the proposal marks a step forward after months of tension between the union and university. William A. Herbert, who directs the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, City University of New York, wrote in an email that the Columbia decision is part of a recent trend that kicked off at Harvard.
"The current willingness of Columbia University to commence bargaining with the union certified to represent its student assistants follows in the footsteps of Harvard, Brown, Georgetown, and other institutions,” Herbert wrote.
The HGSU-UAW bargaining committee wrote in an emailed statement that they support Columbia’s union regardless of the outcome of the upcoming vote.
“We know that the current proposal for negotiations has created robust debate, and we support the student workers at Columbia regardless of if they vote to approve the agreement or continue with a strike,” HGSU-UAW negotiators wrote. “We stand with them and campaigns across the nation in our joint struggle to assert our labor rights as student workers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even after the Democratic takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives in this month’s midterm elections, Harvard may still contend with a tax on its multibillion dollar endowment for years to come.
A congressman from Harvard’s state will almost certainly lead the committee charged with overseeing tax policy once Democrats officially take power in January — but his ascension might not bring about the policy overhaul the University has hoped for.
The endowment tax, enacted as part of the 2017 Republican-led Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, requires Harvard and other institutions with endowments greater than $500,000 per student to pay a 1.4 percent excise tax on endowment returns. The tax is set to take effect for the 2019 fiscal year — and according to University estimates, it will likely cost Harvard between $40 million and $50 million per year.
Harvard sought to prevent the tax for years before it became law, and the University has spent the year since its passage lobbying for its repeal. In March, former University President Drew G. Faust joined 48 other higher education leaders in penning a letter to congressional leaders to express “deep objections” to the federal endowment tax.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow traveled to Washington, D.C. soon after taking office in July to urge legislators to end the tax. In a September 2018 interview, Bacow said the tax will increase the cost of higher education and threaten funds available for financial aid.
In an interview last month, Bacow, who said he was “talking to people on both sides of the aisle” about the issue, said his future lobbying efforts would depend on the results of the midterms and new legislation from the incoming Congress.
“Depending upon how the elections turn out, I may be speaking to different people because there may be different people in Congress,” Bacow said. “There will certainly likely be different chairs of major committees, so that’s likely to change.”
After the midterms delivered Democrats a sizable majority in the House, Congressman Richard E. Neal (D-MA) — a veteran Democrat representing south central Massachusetts — is now poised to become chair of the House Ways and Means Committee. The post will make him the new face of tax issues on Capitol Hill, and he has already begun outlining his priorities.
Among them: chipping away at the Republican tax bill. Neal told CQ Magazine in an April interview that repealing the tax law wholesale will prove difficult with a Republican-controlled Senate and White House.
“Experience tells me it’ll be hard to repeal the law, given the Republican president,” Neal said. “I think that more likely you would try to shape it to the realities of the day.”
Instead, Neal said, Democrats will focus on eliminating smaller provisions of the law. In the April CQ interview, Neal indicated the endowment tax could be one of the portions Democrats attempt to reverse.
More recently, however, experts say the calculus within the Democratic party may have changed. Democrats largely oppose the endowment tax and prominent party leaders, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), have spoken out against it. But not all Democrats share that priority — this year, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Neal’s own state campaigned in favor of a tax on university endowments.
Democratic candidate for Massachusetts governor Jay Gonzalez proposed his own 1.6 percent endowment tax in September that would have cost Harvard over $500 million per year. Gonzalez lost his election bid in November to incumbent Governor Charles D. Baker ’79, who garnered more than two-thirds of the vote.
Experts say these rifts among Democrats over the endowment tax issue may mean it will take lower priority when Neal ascends to the committee’s helm.
Boston College political science professor David A. Hopkins ’99 said the issue of the endowment tax splits Democrats between those who are sympathetic to universities and those who want to use the revenue to redistribute wealth. Gonzalez, for instance, proposed using the funds generated from a state-level tax on Massachusetts universities’ endowments to bolster public education in the state.
“There's a debate that I suspect has the potential to be a lively one, just in terms of what the correct liberal position should be on a policy question like that,” Hopkins said. “If you're a Democratic leader, especially if it's to some degree a moot debate anyway in terms of potential for actual policy change, I think opening that debate is something you'd be pretty reluctant to do."
A spokesperson for Neal did not respond to requests for comment.
Experts say Neal will likely face pressure to undo the tax from other Massachusetts universities. The state alone contains six institutions of higher education affected by the tax — including Williams College, which is located in the district Neal represents.
But experts also urged caution in lobbying, emphasized that Neal and even universities like Harvard may not want to be seen defending elite institutions with hefty endowments. Harvard’s endowment in the 2018 fiscal year was valued at $39.2 billion after returning 10 percent on its investments.
Harvard Law School visiting professor and corporate tax specialist Howard E. Abrams said he expects any repeal of the endowment tax to come from a revenue-neutral bill, an act which pairs a revenue-losing measure like a possible repeal with a provision that raises money through the taxation of other sources.
Abrams warned “negative spin” might come out of Harvard lobbying against the tax and said he thought any lobbying will likely be conducted “in a very creative and relatively quiet way.”
“In a revenue neutral bill, we've got to raise taxes on somebody,” Abrams said. “Does Harvard want to be in that position and be Harvard, with the highest endowment of any university in the world, [who] wants to raise taxes on other people? I'm not sure they want that PR.”
Kennedy School public policy lecturer David C. King said a repeal on the endowment tax would be “very bad politics” for Neal.
“It makes no sense to be seen publicly allied with the elite of the elite, while the Democratic party is trying to position more believably as focused on the interests of the middle class of America,” King said.
Still, Bacow said he continues to make the case to lawmakers that the endowment tax is “lousy public policy.”
Speaking about Gonzalez’s proposal in a September interview, he said “I’m all in favor of additional support in the state for K-12 education…but I don’t understand why taking scarce resources away from colleges and universities which have been entrusted to them to help support your education represents good public policy.”
Asked whether Bacow plans to meet with Neal to push this message, University spokesperson Melodie Jackson declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last May, Ph.D. student Madeleine F. Jennewein sat for hours, remaining mostly quiet, at a Harvard student fair held in cobblestoned Dudley courtyard.
She was there to tell new Graduate School of Arts and Sciences admits about the resources available to BGLTQ students on Harvard’s campus. Jennewein noticed that every other table at the fair was manned by a paid staffer or student. She was unpaid.
Suddenly, she realized she couldn’t do it anymore.
“I kind of reached my breaking point,” Jennewein said. “Every single other table was like a paid person who had an office, and then there's me, trying to make it seem like we have resources.”
Jennewein and other BGLTQ Harvard graduate students say they have long sought more help and resources from University administrators, with little luck. Specifically, students say the Harvard lacks paid staff, events, and advising targeted to BGLTQ-identifying graduate students — and fails to keep up with peer Ivy League institutions who do offer these services.
The push to improve the situation for BGLTQ GSAS affiliates began well before Jennewein arrived at Harvard, when leaders of LGBTQ@GSAS — the student group that serves BGLTQ graduate students — first asked administrators for more funding and dedicated resources. In 2016, the group released an open letter describing problems they said they faced in Cambridge including “homophobia and transphobia,” “implicit bias,” and “attrition.”
“Across Harvard there is an unspoken assumption is that everyone is cisgender and fits into the gender binary, which means that departments often fail to integrate students who do not,” the statement read. “We understand anecdotally that a disproportionate number of students who have left their programs are queer, female, minorities, or some combination thereof.”
The letter made several asks of GSAS administrators, chief among them the installation of a Dudley fellow to serve BGLTQ students. Dudley House — which assists both graduate students and undergraduates — employs 26 graduate fellows in fields including “athletics,” “arts,” and “food literacy” to organize events for Harvard affiliates interested in their dedicated areas.
Though GSAS hired two diversity fellows last semester, it has never employed a fellow focused on BGLTQ issues. A Harvard spokesperson did not directly respond to a question asking whether GSAS plans to hire a BGLTQ-focused fellow.
LGBTQ@GSAS leaders emailed Dudley House Faculty Deans James M. Hogle and Doreen M. Hogle last year renewing their call for the Hogles to add a fellow for BGLTQ students. The group has also cited the event Jennewein staffed without pay as one of the reasons Dudley needs to pay someone to focus on challenges confronted by BGLTQ graduate students.
“Unless the fellows have, in their job description, specific requirements that they implement programming for LGBTQ students or other minorities as the case may be, simply having queer or other minority students as fellows is not going to effectively support these populations,” group leaders wrote in the email. “Instead, it places those fellows in the position of potentially not serving the minority community they are a part of or the GSAS community as a whole well.”
In a chain of emails LGBTQ@GSAS later posted publicly on Facebook, Hogle responded by arguing that the Dudley Fellows program is not the right medium to accomplish the BGLTQ group’s goals. He wrote that “a few concrete examples of our working model for Fellows” help explain why he believes GSAS should not create a fellow position specifically for BGLTQ students.
In one email, he compared the students’ request for a BGLTQ-focused fellow to a previous request that Harvard hire a fellow focused on jazz.
“A[t] various time points an applicant said ‘I want to direct a jazz band,’ so we created a position within the Music Fellow group whose primary responsibility was to organize and conduct a jazz band, rather than created a position called a Jazz Band Fellow,” he wrote.
GSAS administrators ultimately worked with LGBTQ@GSAS to deploy a sticker campaign aimed at BGLTQ graduate students. The stickers read: “You Are Welcome Here.”
Ph.D. student Sa-kiera T. J. Hudson, who is a member of the DuBois Society, a GSAS group for underrepresented minorities, agreed with Jennewein’s characterization of the issues BGLTQ students face.
“There are a lot of departmental issues, and the question becomes: where do you go when you have issues and the DGS is not particularly helpful,” she said. “There isn’t that much infrastructure in terms of support, but if you want to throw a party, you can.”
Asked about criticisms of the Hogles, a Harvard spokesperson pointed to recent steps GSAS has taken to improve the overall graduate student experience. In addition to adding the new diversity fellows, the school has organized workshops on diversity and inclusion and launched an outreach campaign to student affinity groups.
GSAS Dean for Academic Programs and Diversity Sheila Thomas — who Jennewein and Hudson both called an ally within the administration — wrote in an emailed statement that the school is currently working to better support its BGLTQ students.
“The GSAS Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs (ODMA) regularly meets with underrepresented minority students, including student groups. ODMA is determining how to expand this model to the LGBTQ community so that we can better support their particular needs,” Thomas wrote.
Hudson said that, while these changes are positive, serious problems linger. She called Harvard “a toxic space” for some graduate students — especially those identifying as BGLTQ.
“You have some resources, but then you go into the lived experiences of some people and they don’t match up. That’s harder to advocate for and harder to talk about, when you say, ‘I don’t feel like I belong at Dudley House,’” Hudson said. “It gets to a point where people don’t go to Dudley House because they feel like there’s nothing there for them.”
Leaders within LGBTQ@GSAS have noted that Harvard trails behind peer institutions when it comes to supporting BGLTQ affiliates. Harvard’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life serves only undergraduates, while similar offices at Brown, Cornell, MIT, Princeton, UPenn, and Yale serve both college and graduate students. Several of these centers also employ paid graduate fellows tasked with focusing on BGLTQ issues.
Hudson and Jennewein said the resource gap at Harvard leaves BGLTQ graduate students without a place where they can seek help, given many graduate students do not want to use resources meant for undergraduates.
As BGLTQ graduate students continue to call for more support, GSAS student life is undergoing a broader series of changes.
The Hogles announced earlier this year they plan to step down in 2019, a move GSAS Dean Emma Dench said prompted her to consider reorganizing the way the school approaches student life. Currently, some College students — in particular those living outside the 12 upperclassman residential Houses — and GSAS students are both served by Dudley House.
Under Dench’s new system, debuted in October, Dudley House will cease to exist and undergraduate and graduate students will be served by two separate bodies. One — dubbed the “Dudley Community” — will serve undergraduates living outside the Houses, College students living in the Dudley Co-Op, visiting students, and students who live on campus during the summer. The other will serve only GSAS students.
“Since Dudley House broadened its mission to include GSAS students in 1991, thousands of students have benefited from intellectual and social activities organized by their peers,” Dench wrote in an email announcing the change. “We now have the opportunity to enhance these opportunities, enabling our students to make life outside the library or lab a priority.”
Jennewein said she is “optimistic” that, under the new system, BGLTQ students will find Lehman Hall a more welcoming space.
But Hudson said any real progress will require major changes and increased student input.
“[The Hogles] had a lot of power in terms of how to structure Dudley,” Hudson said. “Maybe the Hogles being gone will be good, but the structures in place need to be completely rehauled.”
Correction: Nov. 29, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Dudley House Faculty Deans James M. Hogle and Doreen M. Hogle collaborated with LGBTQ@GSAS to organize a sticker campaign meant to make BGLTQ graduate students feel welcome on campus. In fact, the Hogles were not involved with the sticker campaign.
Correction: Nov. 27, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Dudley House hired two diversity fellows last semester. In fact, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences hired the fellows.
Correction: Nov. 27, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that LGBTQ@GSAS leaders emailed Dudley House Faculty Deans James M. Hogle and Doreen M. Hogle in April 2018 to renew their call for a BGLTQ-focused fellow. In fact, group leaders emailed the faculty deans last year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six games into the season, the Harvard men’s basketball team sits at an even .500 as it grudges through a competitive non-conference schedule. A marquee win over top mid-major Saint Mary’s on Saturday night bookended a California road trip that featured a trip to Twitter headquarters and a live Warriors-Blazers game in Oracle Arena for the team. The Crimson had previously fallen to San Francisco and Rhode Island by narrow margins, so this win against the Gaels without offensive centerpiece Chris Lewis (and of course, Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns) is indeed a promising sight for Crimson fans.
What the Saint Mary’s game revealed — as well as its two other victories over MIT and UMass — was how critical the second unit will be to not only holding fort as the team awaits Aiken and Towns’ return, but also to providing coach Tommy Amaker with a superfluous amount of options in his reserves even with a healthier team. The challenge of finding the necessary game minutes and getting players into rhythm and chemistry in the face of such a deep bench will be perhaps this team’s most critical task heading into the Ancient Eight slate.
Just to put simply, the Crimson reserves scored nine points or less combined in each of its three defeats. In its trio of victories? 35 bench points against MIT. 22 against UMass. 31 against Saint Mary’s. The numbers could not be more startling, and frankly, obvious.
Another evident stat? Amaker has given at least five reserves 9-plus minutes in each of those three victories. Compared to the tail end of last season when then-freshmen Rio Haskett and Danilo Djuricic were the only trusted reserves to earn double-digit minutes on a recurring basis, the Amaker catchphrase of “bench and balance” is no longer just an aphorism, but something actually enacted in practice.
More so, there is a system of pseudo-platooning that is in place now that allows more consistency between rest for starters and a comfortability in both units. Unlike last season when the likes of Christian Juzang and Justin Bassey were quite literally playing all 40 minutes of the game, minutes are more evenly split at the start of this campaign. In the past three games, for example, only Djuricic and Bassey had to play more than 30 minutes in one outing.
The ability to have this second group of able players, listed below, is a tremendous asset that few teams in the Ivies can match with their subbing. One can only look at Dartmouth, Yale, or Penn with largely a cast of two (or three at best) trusted reserves so far this year, to see the Crimson’s comparative advantage.
Here is that unit:
PG- Spencer Freedman
Wing- Noah Kirkwood
Wing- Corey Johnson
Big- Robert Baker
Big- Henry Welsh
Below, I quickly break down how each player has fared so far this season.
Spencer Freedman
This relatively small guard may have not yet put a major dent in the stat sheet, averaging 3.2 points per game and 1.3 assists per game, but there a few noticeable in-game changes that occur when the freshman is on the court. First, the Mater Dei product’s astute court awareness and ability to find open men while on the dribble is key to both court spacing and ball distribution. Freedman’s assist percentage is currently at 15.8 percent (proportion of teammate field goals assisted while on court), slightly below team leaders Juzang and Bassey.
Although limited at the rim, Freedman’s most lethal scoring weapon is his long-range three, something he has not been afraid of unleashing. His most impressive contest was his 3-of-3 tally against Northeastern. His speed off the dribble, ability to fight through tight corners and thread the needle, and potential danger from long range has earned him important back-up minutes. Here is one example of Freedman’s range.  
Noah Kirkwood
Tabbed as the Ivy League Rookie of the Week, the Canadian put up a dozen points in both contests in the West Coast in about two times as many minutes per game. Kirkwood leads the bench in scoring averaging 8.0 PPG and trails only Lewis as far as scoring per 40 minutes with 16.7 points (with players who have seen more than 10 minutes of game action this season).
Kirkwood has two distinct strengths: his ability to finish off the isolation particularly with a dangerous step-back shot, as well as his aggressive and crafty style of attacking the basket for lay-ups (see below). Despite sometimes appearing undersized, Kirkwood is able to leverage his quickness and agility to his advantage in order to singlehandly create offensive opportunities.
Corey Johnson
Perhaps the most quiet player so far on Amaker’s bench has been his captain. Earning his first start of the season against Saint Mary’s, Johnson has yet to find his shooting touch yet from deep, converting just two triples in 14 attempts. Amaker has acknowledged several times last season the importance of his now-senior regaining confidence back in his shot, so patience appears to be key.
Johnson acknowledged in preseason his desire to diversify his game and create shots off the dribble, and some noticeable strides have been made on this front. Foremost however will be the rediscovery of the shooting touch for this long-distance specialist.
Robert Baker
Used rather sparingly in his first two seasons with the Crimson, this former top-100 recruit has solidified a more stable role coming off of the Harvard bench this season. A clear defensive threat with his 6’ 11” frame, Baker posted his first double-digit scoring night against Saint Mary’s with two critical hook finishes to seal the game, one of which is featured below.
Baker will continue to play an important role of the bench as a high-energy man, but his improvements as far as rebounding (a career-best 3.5 RPG) and improved confidence finishing at the rim with a 44.4 field goal percentage will continue to be critical. Another cool advanced stat? Baker leads the team as far as total rebounding percentage at 19.7, meaning that when he is on the court, he grabbed the highest proportion of available boards.
Henry Welsh
Things are pretty upbeat for the Welsh family these days. Elder brother Thomas Welsh just picked up his first NBA career basket on a top-of-the-arc triple with the Denver Nuggets after graduating from UCLA in the spring. Henry Welsh himself stepped up in huge fashion for the Lewis-less Crimson against Saint Mary’s, knocking down 15 points to lead his team and set a new career-high.
Another area of Henry’s game that he has invested in? Harkening back to his brother, the younger Welsh has been quite ambitious in expanding his own shooting range. The Redondo Beach, Calif., native has converted on two triples in six attempts so far this season after never before taking a three in his Crimson career.
On the interior, Welsh through six games is shooting at a rate that rivals the efficiency of starter Chris Lewis. While Lewis finished his sophomore year shooting at an Ivy-best 60.1 percent from the field, Welsh currently is at a 58.3 percent mark. His career average sits around 50 percent, and if his triples are discounted, the big man is shooting at a 15-for-23 rate. Not bad for someone who averaged less than eight minutes per game last season.
Much like Lewis, Welsh is extremely versatile with his post-move footwork, pick-and-roll movement, and overall ability to protect the interior with his 6-foot-10 frame. Here is one example of finishing off the screen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I think I always wanted to be an Olympian. Ever since I watched the women’s national team when I was a little girl, I knew I wanted to be there. I wanted to be at the Olympics.”
From a young age, Alberta native Karly Heffernan, now a senior, had already set her sights upon a dream which many athletes aspire to achieve. Like many, she had grown up with the sport, devoting countless hours to something she loved — ice hockey.
“Karly, from day one, when she was barely old enough to talk, would absolutely go crazy,” James Heffernan, her father, remembers. “She couldn’t pronounce it right, she would go ‘awkey awkey.’ When she was first learning how to skate, I would have both her and her brother in my arms, and what’s interesting is that most kids start crying when they’re on the ice. They don’t want to be on the ice. Her brother wouldn’t stop crying until I picked him up. But not Karly. You just knew she belonged on the ice.”
“I grew up in Alberta, Canada,” Heffernan said. “Everyone plays hockey. I actually don’t [remember my first time on the ice]. It’s crazy. I remember morning practices at 6 a.m. in the cold small town [in] Alberta. My dad would come into my room and I wouldn’t wake up and then he would say I have hockey and then I would spring out of bed. He always tells that story, but I really don’t remember a time I wasn’t skating because we had an outdoor rink outside of our backyard and I genuinely think I skated as soon as I could walk.”
In the fifth grade, Heffernan joined a sports academy, an experience she called her childhood dream. In high school, she joined the Vimy Ridge School for Athletes in Calgary, enabling her to travel throughout the United States playing a sport she loved with a team she grew up with. At age 16, she joined the Canadian National Team, playing in her first world championship.
“It was in Finland,” Heffernan recalled. “It was the craziest experience ever because it was my first time overseas and I was the youngest member on the team. In the gold medal final, we went into overtime with the United States, which was crazy. I was put out with my teammate Hanna Bunton (Cornell ’17) and she passed me the puck and I actually scored the overtime goal. It was the coolest thing of my entire life.”
In her first season for the Crimson, Heffernan earned 20 points (9–11—20) through 35 games, registering a career-best four points on two goals and two assists in the 7-1 win over Brown on Feb. 7. In the 2015 ECAC Championship game, the team felt her presence through a tally and an helper as Harvard claimed a 7-3 victory over Cornell. As a sophomore, she scored in the second ECAC quarterfinal game at Colgate, capping off the season with 24 points (8–16—24) through 32 games.
CONTROLLING THE CONTROLLABLES
Following that season, Heffernan was invited to a Team Canada training camp in May. Near the end of an intense day, she felt a pop in her foot. Nothing too out of the ordinary, and definitely nothing that she felt she couldn’t overcome. It was only months later, at the start of the 2016-2017 fall season, when doctors found that her stress fracture had become into a serious fracture, leading Heffernan to decide to take a year off.
“The decision was made that day by me and then the coaches were all for it,” Heffernan said. “It was an immediate yes, go for it. The entire team and all the coaches were all very supportive. They were incredible, and they are by far a family to me. Hockey is so much more than a sport to all of us. It’s 100% like family.”
After her surgery, Heffernan’s mindset changed. With her first major injury and surgery, she was prepared to come back stronger than ever. “It was go time. For the first time in my life, I really felt like I was the underdog. For me, it wasn’t the end of the road, just a roadblock.”
“My really good friend used to send me ‘CTC’ — control the controllables,” Heffernan said. “I think it really resonated with me because I had zero control over the situation. I focused on controlling what I could: my recovery progress and my mental state.”
Heffernan knew where she wanted to be. “[Being on the ice] was just so natural to me. I felt like it was my second home. Nothing else mattered when I was on the ice and that was a huge thing for me. I was going to be back [on the ice].”
Following a year off to rehab her foot, Heffernan came back prepared to play in the 2017-2018 season. However, continued pain required her to undertake a second surgery on her foot, once again sidelining her for the entire season. After heavy consideration with friends, family, teammates, and coaches, Heffernan decided to take a step back from hockey.
“I remember the day that I told my coaches and team,” Heffernan said. “That was when it felt like my final decision. I remember getting in the car with my dad and I broke down. In almost an instant it’s gone. It’s gone. People always want to say to not let it be part of your identity, but [hockey] was a lot of who I was. And that was so okay with me.”
LIFE'S FULL OF CHANGES
“I have not really skated since August of 2016,” Heffernan said. “I haven’t been on the ice for more than a year. At first it was medical and now I’m at a point where I’m almost scared to.… But I don’t miss it too much right now, which is really strange.”
After over two years off the ice, Heffernan has now embraced the other aspects of her life as a college student.
“I’ve been able to take different classes because I’m not practicing all the time, which has been really cool for me,” Heffernan said. “I’ve also managed to find a job. I don’t think I would have been able to do that if I was in a sport, to be honest. I’ve just put my focus on different things this semester especially which has been huge.
“However, I feel as much a part of the team as I did when I was playing. Some of my best friends are still on the team. I go to team events. Whenever I see them it’s the same feeling; the atmosphere we’ve created, the culture that we’ve created. Even if you’ve left the team, they’re still going to support you 100%. They’ve been my biggest rocks and anchors throughout this entire process.”
In making the transition from hockey player to college student, Heffernan noted that finding a new identity outside of sports was something that many athletes unfortunately experience.
“I think it’s a very common thing that students experience, unfortunately,” Heffernan said. “They are left to find their new identity outside of sports while still attending college. I think it’s one thing to be done with sports after college because you know it’s coming, but it’s a whole other thing to be done before when you don’t know it’s coming. Nothing can prepare you for having your routine that’s defined your life for such a long time to just simply vanish.”
“I wanted Karly to know that everyone retires from a sport like hockey,” her father mentioned. “Some people play it longer than others. For some, it’s something you stop at age 20 or even at age 30. But everyone retires from hockey at some point. Luckily, Karly has been able to focus her life on new things, but hockey will always be a part of her. Hockey really prepared her for everyday life. Life is full of great achievements and great disappointments. And that’s life. And that’s what hockey is like as well.”
Since retiring from hockey, Heffernan has stepped out of comfort zones and has been able to refocus her priorities onto building closer relationships with family and friends that are outside of the sports world. Her roommate, senior Jill Scyocurka, faced similar hurdles through her time at Harvard. Coming in as a lacrosse player, she had suffered several torn ligaments in her knee at the end of her high school spring. As such, she eventually shifted her focus onto sailing in her sophomore year. But after a herniated disc this summer and fall, Scyocurka realized that she couldn’t continue athletics in her final semesters.
“It was hard at first to imagine what my experience at Harvard would be like,” Scyocurka said. “At first, I was really frustrated; it felt like I was wasting time and not appreciating my experience at Harvard. But I’ve realized how lucky I was to have such great friends. I really spent that extra time [outside of training] solidifying my friendships and relationships. It’s been so nice to focus on my friends and teachers here at Harvard. I even took an acting class that I’ve been wanting to take since freshman year.
“There’s always a silver lining. If you have faith that whatever you open your life up to, you’ll find a new passion, you’ll learn more about yourself that you never knew. Sometimes devastating news can be such a blessing in disguise.”
Reflecting on her experiences at Harvard, Heffernan also echoed similar sentiments.
“I wouldn’t take back anything,” Heffernan said. “I think what I’ve felt without [hockey] is almost relief because the pressure of it is insane. It’s allowed me to find new things and I think that’s the only way to go about things. When you’re going about a huge change, you have to focus on what life is giving rather than what it’s taken from you. Life’s full of changes and you can never expect any of them.
“I grew up playing hockey for my whole life; I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t on the ice. I played it until I was 21 years old and now I’m on this new journey to find my new passions."

As the weather takes a turn for the worse, there’s only one strategy for survival: beginning our reading period hibernation by stuffing our faces with Harvard Square treats. So to make winter’s approach just a little bit easier, we’ve compiled a list of our favorite guilty pleasures. After all, it’s basically the holiday season now…right?
L.A. Burdick
This hidden gem is an absolute must. The Signature Hot Chocolate comes in both milk and dark, and tastes like pure chocolate warmth. We’re seriously not kidding. The beverage is the smoothest, sweetest, and most delightfully rich drink ever. There’s even a Spicy Hot Chocolate on the menu if you want to switch it up for some extra punch. It’s not the cheapest hot chocolate you’ll ever have, but it’s divine enough to be worth it.
J.P. Licks
If you’re like us and crave hot chocolate late at night, J.P. Licks has cute hot chocolate kits sold to-go for you to make in the comfort of your dorm — super helpful for those days when the trek across Mass Ave’s (toxic) slush just doesn’t seem bearable. With options beyond just ice cream, this convenient spot doesn’t have to be forgotten in the winter. They also serve yummy hot breakfasts, including savory croissants and oatmeal.
Tatte Bakery
Trust us, Tatte’s not just for law school kids or that Manhattanite friend who eats there every day. For $9.50 at Tatte you can order a pastry basket, fully stocked with two butter croissants, a chocolate croissant, a crisp apple muffin, a piece of sweet bread, and one fruity jam. Perfect to share (or to keep all to yourself, let’s be real), this special is a pastry lover’s dream.
Mike’s Pastry
We know it’s getting cold (and wet), but when did that ever stop anyone from scarfing down a cannoli? Correct answer: never. Just across the street from the Smith Center, Mike’s is perfect for those late-night study sessions in the Collaborative Commons. They’ve even gotten into the festive spirit, with creative menu items like a pumpkin spice cannoli. Pro tip: the M&M pretzel sticks are a great source of quick energy when you’re on the go.
Insomnia Cookies
Even though winter may be coming, you’re still a college student, and that means a trip to Insomnia every now and again is practically required. Close to the river Houses (and unfortunately for our diets, the Crimson building), this slice of cookie-filled paradise is — as we all know — open until 3 a.m. and perfect for any late-night cravings. Often hot from the oven, these cookies always taste better late at night. We’ve also heard it said that if you stop by near closing time, they toss in leftovers with your purchase...why not confirm this magical possibility for yourself?
Crema Cafe
Tucked away next to Felipe’s, Crema has everything you could want for when the weather dips into the twenties: gooey ginger molasses cookies, oh-so-fall pumpkin apple chai muffins, and a cozy interior that will let you instantly forget the nor’easter outside (or your midterm). The zucchini cardamom muffin (hear us out on this one!) has the perfect little kick necessary to help you finish your last pset.
Zinneken’s
Wanted to go to Europe this J-term but flights were just too expensive? Pretend you’re in Belgium by heading down Mass Ave to this cute waffle shop. Specializing in create-your-own waffles and fresh-brewed coffee, Zinneken’s is guaranteed to warm you up if the thought of an upcoming month-long break can’t. If you’ve got an especially big sweet tooth, run next-door to BerryLine while you’re at it.
BerryLine 
Because who really cares how cold it gets anyways? BerryLine is BerryLine, meaning it’s timeless. You can literally never go wrong here.
