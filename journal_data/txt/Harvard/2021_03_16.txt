Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak’s much anticipated joint single “Leave the Door Open” from their upcoming debut collaborative album “An Evening with Silk Sonic” merges the duo’s unique sounds and transports the smooth and sultry energies of 1970s soul and 2000s R&B into 2021.
Silk Sonic members Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars have independently curated distinctive musical styles throughout their careers. For Paak, this style is most noticeably influenced by funk and hip hop, with his 2018 album “Oxnard'' combining the vibrant percussive instrumentals of his band Free Nationals with influences from rappers like Snoop Dogg and producers like Dr. Dre. Named to XXL Magazine’s 2016 Freshman List, Paak’s smooth flow and genre-bending musicality blend easily with Mars’ soulful energy.
Citing Prince, Michael Jackson, and James Brown as influences, Mars epitomizes modern soul and R&B with his sultry and smooth vocals. With funk, reggae, and Motown elements apparent in many of his major projects, such as his last album “24k Magic,” some argue that his adoption of historically Black styles of music is cultural appropriation, given his Filipino, Ashkenazi Jewish, and Puerto Rican heritage. However, in an interview with The Breakfast Club, Mars defends his style as a form of cultural appreciation, reminding listeners of “Leave the Door Open” that his music “comes from love.”
In “Leave the Door Open,” Silk Sonic generously leans into this love, resulting in a project that practically oozes nostalgia and sex appeal. Much of this familiarity is rooted in .Paak’s Motown-esque percussion. The slow rhythm .Paak maintains during the verses feels like something everyone should snap to while the quicker tempo of the chorus creates a feeling of mounting need as Mars begs to “leave the door open.” Accompanied by the higher notes of D-Mile’s piano and the depth of Brody Brown’s bass, “Leave the Door Open” tells an entrancing sonic story of desire and seduction.
Against this breathtaking production, the lyrics have the potential to fall a bit flat. In sticking with a theme of seduction, Silk Sonic’s musings on “sippin' wine (Sip, sip) in a robe (Drip, drip) / I look too good (Look too good) / To be alone (Woo, woo)” are nowhere near as complex as the song’s instrumentation. However, the simplicity of these lyrics makes for an extremely enjoyable listening experience, as they’re easy to both relate to and sing along with. When paired with .Paak’s easy flow and Mars’s smooth vocals, who wouldn’t enjoy being asked to “lay in these arms?”
With liquid gold musicality, velvety vocals, and relatable lyrics, “Leave the Door Open” creates a sum greater than its parts. As Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak’s first comprehensive projects since 2016 and 2019 respectively, “Leave the Door Open” augurs a groundbreaking return to the music scene. If this single’s success is any indication, “An Evening with Silk Sonic” is definitely an album worth waiting for.

For the first time in six months, Champagne Papi is back with “Scary Hours 2.” The sequel to his 2018 EP “Scary Hours,” this album offers a sneak peek into the rapper’s life during his brief hiatus, and more importantly, a preview of what’s in store for Drake as an artist.
Ending a long streak of dropping chart-topping singles, this EP consists of three distinct yet coherent songs: “What’s Next,” “Wants and Needs” featuring Lil Baby, and “Lemon Pepper Freestyle” featuring Rick Ross. In between the complex beats and various flows, the bar-heavy verses dominate. Repetitive loop tracks and consistent 808s fade into the background, and the spotlight falls on Drake. There is nothing particularly outstanding about Drizzy as a rapper — his sound isn’t very defined or particularly unique — yet there is something intriguingly recognizable about the infamous way in which he switches his flows. In “Wants and Needs,” for example, Drake wastes no time on tags and goes right into the quick-paced first verse that’s intentionally off-beat, creating a dissonance like he’s purposely neglecting the background music to prioritize his rapping. In that same song, however, the chorus regresses into a slow and mellow tempo — the complete opposite of the spitfire opening lines. That fusion between the early Drake who would sing on his tracks and the new Drake who dives straight into the verse cements his status as an unmatched stylistic chameleon.
Across all three tracks, three main themes are at play: fame, family, and love.
“What’s Next” brings listeners up to speed on what the rapper has been up to. “They wanna know how I’ve been livin’ my day-to-day life,” muses Drake, mocking the ruthless press who “want [his] life exposеd”. At first, he seems to be doing just that, as he fills us in on all the resting, stretching, and sexing he did in the past year. Except that Drake doesn't actually reveal anything, rerunning the ambiguous “we'll see what's 'bout to happen next.” The rapper sums up his frustration in the chorus; “Man, how many times have I shown improvement?” he questions, discontent with the way his fame has outgrown the talent that should be the topic of conversation instead.
Drake keeps things vague to preserve the anonymity he craves, choosing to focus instead on other aspects of his extraordinary lifestyle he’s willing to share.
He lets the audience know that “a boss is a role that [he’s] grown into,” and that’s just “how life goes” in “What’s Next,” and that theme is carried through to “Lemon Pepper Freestyle.” “Godfather with a garden full of snakes,” raps Rick Ross, referencing the celebrated yet burdened life of the great Tupac in his line, “Makaveli, it’s All Eyez on Me.” Drake echoes that twofoldness of being one of the greats in the second verse: “How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?” This sentiment parallels the infamy of “walkin’ around the Six like I invented it,” off the “Scary Hours” single “Diplomatic Immunity,” while also adding the more recently discovered caveat of the constant fear and betrayal that goes along with that feat.
Drake steadfastly barrels through the ins-and-outs of being at the top of his game, unsympathetic of his audience who probably won’t relate with the pressure that stems from being an international mogul, nor the sense of luxury that comes from “dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys” with Weezy. Ironically enough, those extravagant details that he wishes to hide from the public are what end up capturing the listener’s attention the most. The serene melody sampled in the back, however, gives the track a romantic tint, easing the audience through these more abstract concepts.
While “airin’ my dirty laundry” might have been the topic of “Scary Hours,” “Scary Hours 2” sees Drake maturing into a better friend, father, and artist.
“Wants and Needs” shows Drake growing emotionally. It’s not that he’s abandoned his bachelor lifestyle, but that he is more self-aware about love being a want rather than a need. Although, like Lil Baby raps about in his verse, “YOLO” is still very much the motto; the lifestyle is not everything to Drizzy anymore. In place of that careless youthful ambition, thoughts like “Sins… M’s… Friends… Love” are more pressing on Drake’s mind as he reflects on how his achievements “look bigger through my son's eyes.” There is a subtle lyricality to the chorus which sounds reminiscent of early Drake albums like “Nothing Was the Same,” which may be intentional considering the fact that he directly calls out the current rap scene for sounding “like some mothafuckin' fire drills.”
In anticipation of his next album, “Certified Lover Boy,” “Scary Hours 2” attempts (somewhat successfully) to redirect the public’s attention from the minutiae of Champagne Papi’s mogul lifestyle to the more prominent values the rapper has set his sights on. In this transition, the audience can witness Drake grow and mature into that stronger and more self-aware artist who plans to return to the spotlight in the foreseeable future.

Nearly a year after the American Repertory Theater closed its doors in response to the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the A.R.T. still connects its audiences to theater through a continuation of its virtual “Behind the Scenes” series. In the most recent installment, “Behind the Scenes: The Circle of Becoming,” the A.R.T. showcases the spirit of collaboration that’s always driven their work.
Since its founding, the A.R.T. has been a catalyst of innovation within the world of theater, as its work is dedicated to moving beyond boundaries and “is driven by risk-taking and passionate inquiry,” according to the history section of its website. While the show has stopped for many, it is no surprise that the A.R.T. has instead taken advantage of the current virtual moment to foster a newfound sense of digital intimacy that is oftentimes not found online. Ryan S. McKittrick, Dramaturg and Director of Artistic Programs at the A.R.T., acknowledged that the series marked a shift for the theater.
“The ‘Behind the Scenes’ series started as a pivot during the pandemic, thinking about ways that we could engage with audiences digitally,” McKittrick said. However, he contended that the Zoom series has both successfully connected audiences with artists and invited the audience into the developmental process by providing them a glimpse into creators’ ongoing work.
For those that are lucky enough to attend multiple events, the “Behind the Series” series illuminates a variety of different steps in that process. At the A.R.T.’s “Behind the Scenes” event on March 2, V, Justin Tranter, and Idina Menzel shared stories and songs as they gave the audience a sneak peek into the early stages of their upcoming project “The Circle of Becoming.” The event began with the three speakers sharing anecdotes of what brought them together on this project, the research that went into it, and two songs from the project. Audience members got a chance to be among the first people to hear the music as it stands and learn about the highly collaborative process that’s driven the creation of “The Circle of Becoming.”
According to McKittrick, this high level of collaboration is the norm for new projects at the A.R.T. In creating the “Behind the Scenes” series, he and his colleagues hoped to showcase “how work evolves over years” with the help of a talented development team. This process has long been hidden from most general audience members, but the A.R.T. has found a silver lining of our digital world and has used this time to peel the curtain back.
Rebecca L. Curtiss, Public Relations Director at the A.R.T., said that the idea for the series stems from “the realities of being virtual,” and that they’ve received positive audience feedback.
Unlike so many events in our virtual landscape, these glimpses behind the scenes feel intimate.
“The ‘Behind the Scenes’ event brought back a feeling of familiarity, warmth, and intimacy that I’ve felt has been missing over Zoom,” said Victoria Y. Wang ’24, who attended the event last Tuesday. “I’ve never felt so connected to something over a Zoom call.”
The A.R.T. will continue to host more “Behind the Scenes” events over these next few coming months. Interested patrons can get pay-what-you-can access to upcoming offerings; highlights include an event for “The Weeping Camel” with composer Huang Ro, on March 16, and one for “Ocean Filibuster” on April 6.

If someone who can act, sing, and dance is considered a triple-threat, then Elle Shaheen ’21 is a quintuple-threat — at least. Shaheen's stage presence and command of speech came through clearly even as she sat down to talk over a Zoom call about her upcoming creative thesis project: “Recorded Live: The Great American Family Jukebox Cabaret,” which premieres this weekend. The project is a capstone to her time in Harvard’s Theater, Dance, & Media concentration.
Shaheen’s thesis is the culmination of a life wholly dedicated to the arts. After beginning performing arts classes as a child, Shaheen branched out further into writing and producing in high school. Before arriving at Harvard, she was honored by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as the winner of a young playwrights competition. With this background, Shaheen always knew a creative program was in her future. Although she originally considered applying and auditioning for conservatory programs in high school, her interest in writing and producing led her to Harvard instead. “In order to be successful in an industry like this, it’s important to have an understanding of everything that goes into it, every aspect of it,” she said.
Shaheen has taken this holistic approach to heart, devoting herself to every aspect of the performing arts, and she’s excelled at it, becoming one of the first women to join The Hasty Pudding Theatricals. “I try to do as much as I can because inevitably it makes me better,” she said.
When I asked Shaheen about her hobbies and pastimes, she paused for a moment. After collecting her thoughts, she answered, “I’m sort of always practicing,” before adding, “and to me, that’s always fun.”
Shaheen views her artistic training as an expression of herself and as a big part of her personality. When she begins talking in-depth about “Recorded Live: The Great American Family Jukebox Cabaret,” her passion for the project is palpable, and watching her speak about it almost constitutes a show in itself. Her show uses a cabaret framework to weave a story about shared and family history. It started as simply a list of songs that Shaheen felt a connection to, but upon further reflection, she found the common thread between them: her grandfather. They were the songs of his childhood and young adulthood that he had shared with her, a list that included the music of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and Carole King, among others.
The project went through three conceptual iterations before being approved by the department, which in hindsight, Shaheen was thankful for. “It ended up getting me to the right idea,” she said of the long planning process. This “right idea” is one that weaves family and history into the show, accomplished by weaving songs with home videos and family photos, as well as audio from interviews with her grandfather — making the production a true labor of love.
Although working during a pandemic certainly had its challenges, Shaheen was quick to say that the show wouldn’t be the same if not for these circumstances. “This particular project could not have been made a year ago, or a year in the future,” she said.
Being suddenly thrown back home with her family allowed them to be more involved with the project than they would have otherwise had a chance to, as they helped her comb through family archives for more material. Her show lays bare the intricacies of family and how they can often be “complicated and confusing,” and with it, she seeks to find her own place in the family history. ”I hope [audiences] take away the importance of family and connection, especially during this time of really incredible isolation and loss.”
Going forward, Shaheen’s only problem might be that she has too many incredible possibilities with which to continue her artistic success. Although presented digitally due to Covid-19, the show was originally conceived as a live performance, which Shaheen hopes to pursue when theaters reopen. “It’s all going up from here, I’d like to think.”

The otherworldly and retro-style vibe of Justin Bieber’s new single “Hold On” speaks to a kind of familiar, melancholy love many have experienced. This love –– fragmented by his lover’s own sense of emptiness and disorientation in life –– reflects the sentiment of feelings lost in an indifferent world despite having strong support. With a musical quality reminiscent of The Weeknd’s most recent album, “After Hours,” Bieber reaches out to his partner with a message of compassion, asking her to “hold on” until things get better. Likewise, “Hold On” resonates with the current unpredictable and disrupted status of the world, reassuring listeners with a promise of better days.
Although the particular source of his lover’s sorrow is unclear, Bieber’s new single touches on an emotion close to many. He conveys loneliness through the slow-wave rhythm of the music and the expressive quality of his voice. He reflects on his own mistakes, promising to always be a rock for the object of his affections. Nevertheless, this new track is a pleasant divergence from Bieber’s typically more upbeat and lighthearted music style, more in line with his recent ballad “Lonely” than anything else. Although not remarkably deep or elaborately written, “Hold On” is a lowkey song that refreshes listeners with its straightforward message.
The music video itself depicts Bieber’s hospitalized lover, for whom he sells his belongings and even robs a bank to afford her medical bills. However, in the end, he himself is shot –– depicting a grim and almost contradictory ending. His message is meant to be one of reliance and hope, but in the end, neither is enough to save Bieber or his love in the video. Whether this is intentional to the significance of the song itself or just for dramatic effect is unclear. Nonetheless, this song branches further out into his newly slowed-down style category. This open-hearted and gentle sound is refreshing, showing a more relaxed and intimate side of Bieber. His growth and maturity throughout the years manifests in his music, following his many artistic and personal developments. Bieber has self-admittedly made many blunders throughout his career, being in the spotlight from such a young age. Nonetheless, he still has more to offer listeners, and his new music is worth checking out.

Formally called “Dig Inn,” the Northeastern food chain DIG just rejoined Harvard Square’s diverse list of restaurants. The new chain sits inconspicuously on the corner of Mt. Auburn and Dunster Street, and offers an abundance of healthy menu options. For Harvard students, it’s the ideal place to grab a quick, nutritious bite after class.
After having to shut down almost immediately after opening in the summer of 2020, DIG is now available to the public and ready to share its perks with the Cambridge community. Due to the ongoing pandemic, indoor seating is unavailable at the moment, but you can order online or take-out. Fortunately, when dining indoors is permitted again, the layout looks to be fitting for students: After ordering off of their extensive menu, diners have the option to decide whether they are leaning towards a booth to chat with their friends or the smaller, more personal table for a date with homework.
Further, DIG appears to be oriented around the intersection between environmental sustainability and tastiness. As described on their website, the chain’s mission involves providing fresh and organic vegetables to customers while ensuring the ingredients used are sustainably cared for, locally grown, and never go to waste. The site claims that “at the end of each day, our restaurants donate unsold food to organizations like Rescuing Leftover Cuisine and New England Center & Home for Veterans.” DIG focuses on many productive objectives, including diversifying its partners to more minority growers and backing certified farmers transitioning from conventional to organic farming.
DIG offers a vast selection of food options, ranging from hot soups to fresh salads. Each menu option includes a list of ingredients that may conflict with dietary restrictions, such as animal products, soy, nuts, etc. After looking at the selection of foods on their online menu –– like the “Spicy Meatball Bowl” or the “ Winter Forager’s Salad” –– I decided to go with the Cauliflower Cobb Salad and a side of Mac and Cheese.
Once my salad was ready to go, it came as no surprise that it was wonderful, filling, and fresh. As for the Mac n Cheese, my only complaint was that it could have used more flavor. Although, I cannot deny its great texture nor the fact that it felt like a simple and light snack.
DIG serves as an exciting new addition to the Harvard community that not only delivers delicious foods –– and an eventual welcoming space for Harvard students –– but an intent behind each ingredient blended into those foods. The chain connects its customers to a broader network of organic farms and incorporates fair practices. What they are bringing to Cambridge is food you can feel good about eating, but more importantly supporting.
Overall, given how palatable the food was and the greater picture behind DIG’s initiative, I can positively say that I will go back sometime soon, and you should too. Get your compostable silverware ready!

It’s the fall of 1987 in Dallas, but for Pat, Anne, and Dan Malone, daily life amounts to a whole lot more than trips to the fluorescent mall, outrageous high school parties, and hair teased up to the sky — no matter what pop culture’s ongoing fascination with the Reagan Era might otherwise imply.
Rather than just wax nostalgic about one of the most overly romanticized decades in American history, Sean Desmond centers his new novel “Sophomores” on a highly dysfunctional family, struggling to remain afloat through a crumbling marriage, an unexpected lay-off, and a battle with addiction. Of course, the book still includes the humorous antics of sophomore Dan Malone as he faces the awkward trials of his early high school years. Yet, going beyond the goofy, big-hearted scenes that feel straight out of a John Hughes movie, Desmond profiles not just the charming young protagonist but also the deteriorating marriage and emotional stagnation of his parents, typically the one-dimensional background characters in this brand of Bildungsroman.
Pat, the head of the Malone clan, uses a constant stream of alcohol to cope with a miserable job at an airline company and a recent multiple sclerosis diagnosis. His son, Dan, thrives in his English class, led by the particularly enthusiastic Mr. Oglesby, while dropping the ball when it comes to flirting with girls. Dan’s mother, Anne, becomes a juror for a high-profile attempted murder trial that tests her Catholic faith and forces her to reflect on her own suffering marriage. The disjointedness of these three plotlines helps contribute to the portrait of a family completely isolated from one another, but because these different threads never properly tie together and rarely even cross paths, it also makes for a rather unsatisfying conclusion. In fact, despite the excellent character development and unflinching look at alcoholism, infidelity, and religious hypocrisy, “Sophomores” is less than the sum of its well-executed parts.
As someone who grew up in Dallas during the ‘80s and even attended the same Jesuit College Preparatory school featured in “Sophomores,” author Sean Desmond appears to have infused much lived experience into this story, especially within Dan Malone’s coming-of-age tale. The captivating English teacher who pushes Dan to fulfill his potential, for example, was based on a real life Mr. Oglesby, a “hero” who taught Desmond how “to think about art, ideas and all of life’s mysteries.” Even the members of Dan’s mildly dorky crew — Rick, Rob, and “Sticky” — are named after Desmond’s actual childhood friends. His engrossing descriptions of Dallas, a city of “late-Reagan contradictions'' with “plenty of materialistic asshatery to rage against,” include the specificity and intimate details that only a true native could provide. For anyone who doesn’t fall into the niche of Irish-Catholic resident of Dallas, however, Desmond’s specificity adds vibrancy to the setting and characters without turning the story into something exclusive or inaccessible. The only exceptions might be Dan’s eight-page documentation of his father’s “Catholic sports hierarchy” or the overly detailed play-by-play coverage of a high school football game which, for anyone not enthusiastic about sports, might be worth skimming.
Reminiscent of “Dead Poets Society'' if Whitman was swapped out for Orwell and Salinger, Dan Malone’s storyline shines through as the highlight of the novel. Whenever we catch a glimpse into Mr. Oglesby’s sophomore honors classroom, observing the teacher armed with both a “persuasion stick” and an encyclopedic knowledge of every trivial detail from the books he assigns, we know we’re in for a treat. Each chapter from Dan’s point of view, as he prank calls his crush, wars with the class know-it-all for the top spot in English, and clowns around with his fellow swimming teammates, acts a breath of fresh air from some of the novel’s heavier subject matter.
The sections focused on Pat and Anne Malone, unfortunately, provide no such levity — even if they are just as thoughtfully written. Deeply flawed but also undoubtedly sympathetic, Pat Malone battles the two diseases of MS and alcoholism, and as he continues to fall further and further towards rock-bottom, Desmond does not hesitate to bring his novel to an incredibly dark place. Pat’s patient diary for his MS medication, in particular, turns into a heart-breaking confessional about the brutal reality of addiction: “As long as I keep it to myself it’s fine. What’s a life without whiskey? What is that worth? And what’s the point of being miserable?” A fight over dinner from Pat’s intoxicated point of view feels almost claustropic, with the loud, discombobulating nature of the dialogue somehow translating even through the written word. Nevertheless, the author’s ability to evoke such disturbing emotions and his dedication to portraying addiction through an unfiltered lens also makes this broken father’s narrative particularly difficult to get through.
Anne Malone’s storyline injects fresh perspective into a very male-dominated narrative, but as a complex courtroom drama begins to unfold, it seems Desmond may have bitten off more than he can chew. The trial of Reverend Standing Raleigh, accused of strangling his wife after a scandalous affair, presents juror Anne with profound questions about the abuse of power and male privilege within Christian institutions as well as the suffocating dynamic of her own marriage. However, considering all the messiness associated with our current justice system and moral implications of serving as an unbiased jury member, Anne’s plotline opens an ethical can of worms that could have easily led to its own full-length novel. It doesn’t help that her son and husband, in their own little worlds, seem to hardly acknowledge the existence of this high-profile trial let alone Anne’s crucial role in deciding this local celebrity's fate.
To any fan of the typical coming-of-age story, Desmond fills this novel with amusing adventures, witty explorations into classic literature, and tender-hearted moments of familial love. Just be prepared to face an equal amount of pain, grief, and hopelessness along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The K-pop community breathed a collective sigh of relief on March 11 when Spotify and Korean entertainment company Kakao announced that they had reached an agreement to bring hundreds of K-pop songs back to the global streaming service. Several weeks earlier, K-pop listeners had discovered that music from many famous artists, including IU, Apink, and Loona, had vanished from Spotify without any notice. This week-long blackout caused confusion and frenzy in the K-pop community, especially on Twitter, where #spotifyisoverparty started trending in response to the sudden removal of so many beloved songs. After fans discovered the cause of this disappearance — the expiration of the songs’ licensing agreement between Kakao and Spotify on Feb. 28 — a round of finger-pointing began as each company blamed the other for the failure to renew these agreements. However, this dispute seems to have been at least temporarily resolved, as the two companies announced last Thursday morning that all Kakao content, including fans’ most beloved K-pop songs, would be available again on Spotify.
For those not plugged into the world of K-pop or Twitter, the past week’s whirlwind of news may seem like an overreaction to just getting some songs back. But this showdown between Spotify and Kakao Entertainment is more than just a fight over licensing agreements of K-pop songs: It’s actually part of a much larger problem in the music industry — who gets to control what music streams and what doesn’t?
Understanding this chaos between Spotify and Kakao requires a deeper look into the Korean music streaming market and its relationship with the global market. Kakao (formally known as KakaoM) is a powerhouse South Korean entertainment company that operates as both a talent agency and music distribution company. As a music distribution company, Kakao Entertainment owns the rights to 37.5 percent of Gaon Chart’s — Korea’s music industry standard record chart — year-end Top 400 Songs chart from 2020. This includes music by K-pop stars like IU, Apink, Zico, Epik High, Loona, and more. In addition to owning the rights to many popular K-pop songs, Kakao Entertainment also owns Melon, which is Korea’s largest music streaming service with nearly nine million monthly active users.
In short, one company in Korea wields disproportionate power over both the distribution and streaming of K-pop.
For many years, domestic streaming services such as Melon (owned by Kakao Entertainment), Genie, Flo, and Bugs have dominated the South Korean music streaming industry. When Apple Music tried to enter the South Korean music streaming market in 2016, they immediately encountered obstacles — like being unable to acquire domestic licensing agreements for K-pop — and found little footing within the market. For example, Kakao Entertainment allowed a licensing deal with Apple Music for the streaming of their K-pop songs outside of South Korea, but not within South Korea.
But where does Spotify fall into this narrative?
On Feb. 1, Spotify launched its streaming services in South Korea — the sixth largest music market in the world. But there was one problem: Spotify was unable to secure domestic licensing deals with Kakao because it had become a direct competitor of Kakao’s own streaming service, Melon. At the same time, time was ticking for the original global licensing agreement between Spotify and Kakao to be renegotiated before its termination on March 1.
The two companies became embroiled in the intricacies of the license’s renewal. Eventually, March 1 arrived without an agreement, leading to the purging of K-pop songs on Spotify across all markets. According to The Korea Herald, these talks failed because Kakao wanted separate licensing distribution agreements for the domestic market in Korea and the global market, but Spotify turned down this proposal and refused to renew the original global distribution agreement without the domestic one.
For one week, Spotify and Kakao continued to butt heads, refusing to concede and releasing statements blaming each other for failing to renew the global license. Meanwhile, K-pop fans were left in the complete dark as days passed without signs of the affected songs’ return to Spotify. Expressing his frustration, hip hop group Epik High’s Tablo tweeted, “Apparently a disagreement between our distributor Kakao M & Spotify has made our new album Epik High Is Here unavailable globally against our will. Regardless of who is at fault, why is it always the artists and the fans that suffer when businesses place greed over art?”
Eventually, Spotify and Kakao reached an agreement to renew the global licensing, and K-pop artists like Epik High saw their music return to the streaming service starting on March 12. The K-pop community rejoiced as they went back to jamming out to their favorite songs. The dispute faded into the background.
But underneath the apparent “success” of the negotiation lies a darker picture of the future of the music industry — the rise of monopolistic streaming service gatekeepers like Spotify and Kakao. In the United States, nearly 80% of all music revenue in 2019 came from streaming services, which was dominated by a few platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and others. As more listeners switch to using streaming services, the power of controlling the streaming and access of music falls into the hands of these corporations, not listeners.
This showdown between Spotify and Kakao is a prime example of what happens when two unchecked music streaming services care more about complete control over a market than allowing artists to have their music reach worldwide audiences. Whether Spotify or Kakao got the “better deal” in the new licensing agreement doesn’t matter because, in the end, the only losers were the artists — whose music rights these companies violated — and listeners like you and me. As long as music streaming services continue to “place greed over art” as Tablo tweeted, they will not only affect the K-pop world, but also put other genres’ artists and listeners at risk of losing access to the art itself.

The solar-powered narrator of Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel “Klara and the Sun” sees her energy source as capable of granting wishes and resurrecting the dead. Of all the memories Klara stores in her PEG-9-filled head, the first she shares with readers revolves around her beloved (and capitalized) Sun. She reaches for a sunbeam on the floor of the department store where she lives, only for a fellow AF, or Artificial Friend, to chide her as “greedy” when the light fades. Klara’s god may disappear from her view behind buildings or below the horizon, but the Sun’s life-giving glow never leaves the robot whose brilliant observational acuity makes Ishiguro’s eighth novel his most touching yet.
Ishiguro reveals the truths of Klara’s surroundings with calculated restraint, the way her image-processing program gradually sharpens indistinct shapes into vivid scenes. The stark economy of his prose, which so often lays bare the intense emotion within, illuminates Klara’s inquisitive insight into a world where the same AI responsible for the “substitution” of so many parents’ jobs cares for their children in the form of AFs. Josie, the frail 14-year-old who chooses Klara as her companion, has been “lifted” through risky gene editing in hopes of securing her future success. When Klara wants to move beyond society’s technological vocabulary, she simply creates her own: Josie receives a virtual education from “oblong tutors,” and her neighbor Rick builds remote-controlled “machine birds.”
The store manager’s praise of Klara as “beautiful and dignified” echoes the obsession with dignity that defines Stevens, the butler protagonist of Ishiguro’s Booker Prize-winning “The Remains of the Day.” While Stevens’ absolute loyalty to his household constantly eclipses his feelings, Klara’s devotion to Josie allows her to realize what love really means. Klara has always understood the fundamental purpose all AFs share — to stave off the inevitable loneliness that arises from an adolescence spent largely on screens — but, as she puts it, “The more I observe, the more feelings become available to me.”
Ishiguro’s reflective dialogue beautifully shows how Klara unlocks her strongest feelings by observing acts of kindness. After Rick’s mother Helen shares her dream of sending her son to college away from home, Klara admits in surprise, “Until recently, I didn’t think that humans could choose loneliness.” Of course she didn’t: The idea of choosing loneliness contradicts her very existence. But witnessing how we bring ourselves to let go of the people we hold closest only strengthens Klara’s — and the novel’s —belief in love.
As the aftermath of being “lifted” chips away at Josie’s health, Klara leaves her side in search of divine intervention. Klara’s first plea to the sunset culminates in one of the novel’s most memorable scenes: a momentous act of self-sacrifice that leads her to justify her later prayers with love itself. “So I know just how much it matters to you that people who love one another are brought together, even after many years,” she reminds the Sun of Rick and Josie’s connection.
That Rick dares to label his love for Josie as “genuine and forever” stands out even more in a dystopian society defined by artifice and impermanence. The future Ishiguro envisions may have undergone scientific upheavals drastic enough to give rise to their own eerie euphemisms — as in his 2005 novel “Never Let Me Go,” a much more bleakly fatalistic take on teenage romance — but never overcomes time’s toll on humans and robots alike. In a haunting reminder of our own mortality, Klara accepts that the events she so carefully recalls and arranges will only live as long as her batteries.
Through his novels’ first-person narrators, Ishiguro excels at conveying the inherent transience of memories without undermining their importance. True to her name, which means “bright,” Klara shines direct light on the tenuous connections that sustain an increasingly isolated world. As a heartfelt exploration of technology’s potential to affect the way we love, “Klara and the Sun” gives all the more reason to cherish our time with each other, just as Klara thanks the Sun for every moment she spends in his warmth.

A teenage girl perches atop her older brother’s bed and molds her fractured pieces into music for the entertainment of nearly 50 million monthly listeners. For most people, this level of sacrifice would be an immediate concern; however, celebrities like Billie Eilish are often expected to put themselves last.
Apple TV’s recent documentary “Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry,” follows the dark-pop singer's rise from blossoming SoundCloud fame to double fisting five Grammy awards barely two months after turning 18. But beyond the billboards and album release parties, the film showcases the exploitative nature of fame, as Eilish’s poor mental and physical health becomes aestheticized.
While Eilish has always suffered from depression, she describes being in her worst mental state at 13 years old. Showing the camera her childhood journal, she points to pages covered in doodles of razor blades and says that she “never thought she would make it to this age.”
But six years later, Eilish’s fame has only brought on new physical and mental struggles.
Known for high energy performances, Eilish frequently bounces around the stage for hours on end. In between shows, she develops shin splints so painful that her father needs to carry her on and off of stage. But rather than give her fans a mediocre show, Eilish jumps on injured legs to the beat of her audience’s screams.
After the performance, Eilish ices her shins. “I’m afraid I’ll wake up and I won’t have any of this anymore,” she says.
Her willingness to place herself in physical pain in exchange for entertaining her fans points to the toxicity that can characterize relationships between artists and their audiences. Although fans often provide support and love to creators, they also often place unrealistic expectations upon them. Afraid to lose the opportunities fame affords them, celebrities like Eilish can often push their personal needs aside regardless of the exhaustion or discomfort they experience. To make matters worse, the world often seeks to analyze the pain of young celebrities growing up under a microscope rather than offer help.
In songs such as “Everything I Wanted,” Eilish places her pain on full display. Throughout the piece, she describes a nightmare she had in which she commits suicide by jumping off of the Golden Gate Bridge. The worst part, she mentions, is that nobody cared. The same prospect of jumping echoes throughout “Listen Before I Go” in which Eilish begs to be taken to the rooftop so she can “see the world when she stops breathing.”
As she and her brother begin producing the song, her mother expresses concern over Eilish’s mental health and such a controversial message being publicized. But Eilish reminds her that it's representative of how she and so many others feel: “This song is the reason I don’t … having this way to say it instead of doing it is better,” Eilish says.
Instead of empathizing with Eilish’s vulnerability, media outlets often demonize her art — claiming that it glamorizes depression to teen listeners. Due to her celebrity status, the volatility of her mental health is disregarded. Her suffering is not validated, but questioned.
When asked by interviewers why she writes sad music, Eilish says “I’m never feeling happy. Why would I write about things I don’t know about? I feel the dark things. I feel them very strongly.”
Unfortunately, Eilish is not alone in these sentiments. In many ways, her songs merely hold a mirror up to her audience — most of whom are youths like herself struggling to keep themselves alive every day. At a time when suicide is the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers, perhaps the question should not be “Why is Eilish’s music so dark?” but rather, “Why do so many teens relate to this darkness?”
To be a young female artist like Billie Eilish is to become okay with being broken and unfortunately aware that, regardless of any calls for help, it is unlikely that you will ever be fixed. It is to push your body to the breaking point and then push a bit farther because it’s in the job description. And for Billie Eilish, it is to sing her darkest struggles to the world, only for them to fall upon deaf ears.

Few acts in life are as stunning as looking up at a star-studded night sky. If you’re tired of staring at your computer screen on tedious Zoom calls, the dazzling beauty and mystery of outer space can provide an enchanting escape. The songs in this playlist are the perfect soundtrack for your stargazing experience, so make sure to dress warm, turn on some tunes, and keep an eye out for Ursa Major.
“Galaxies” by Alice Phoebe Lou
This mesmerizing track from South African indie musician Alice Phoebe Lou is perfect for pondering the mysteries of space. “Just a speck of dust in the Milky Way,” Lou sings, her smooth voice floating across a gorgeous instrumental track complete with electric piano and synthesizers. A spellbinding song that is both soothing and invigorating, “Galaxies” is perfect for finding comfort in the stars.
“Empire Ants” by Gorillaz (feat. Little Dragon)
At four minutes and 44 seconds, this song is pure magic. Damon Albarn’s vocals are layered over a relaxed beat and shimmering keys to create a beautifully nostalgic track. “Empire Ants” builds and builds until it erupts in an explosion of synths, all with the distinctive vocals of Little Dragon’s Yukimi Nagano drifting hazily on top.
“Close 2 U” by Raveena
“Close 2 U” is reminiscent of a nice, hot shower after a long day. This song gives you a warm embrace and, through its layered vocals and cozy atmosphere, lets you know that everything will be okay. Whether you are curled up underneath a warm blanket looking at the night sky or simply gazing at the stars through your bedroom window, wind down and let Raveena’s calming voice guide you through the night.
“Starlight” by Pure X
A song named “Starlight” may be too obvious a candidate for a stargazing playlist, but with its soft vocals and dreamy atmosphere, this song by Pure X is ideal for laying back and getting lost in the music.
“Sometimes He’s In My Dreams” by Mary Lattimore
Harpist Mary Lattimore teamed up with Slowdive’s Neil Halstead to bring us this achingly beautiful piece. Lattimore’s virtuosic harp[-]playing twinkles and shines, with reverb and delay layered in to create a truly dreamy atmosphere fitting for those introspective moments under the night sky.
“Space Song” by Beach House
Now that Lattimore has us feeling contemplative, it’s time for Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally to bring us their bittersweet sound. “Space Song” creates a nostalgic sense of yearning for times that once were and times that never will be. After all, this wouldn’t be a proper stargazing playlist without a track by Beach House.
“The Moon Song” by beabadoobee and Oscar Lang
Do you want to cry under the stars? If so, “The Moon Song” is for you. Originally written by Karen O for the film “Her”, beabadoobee and Oscar Lang’s cover is beautifully poignant and raw — the perfect song for reflecting on life.
“Over the Moon” by the Marias
Once the cry session brought on by beabadoobee and Oscar Lang’s touching song has ended, this easygoing track from The Marías brings a steady diet of relaxed beats and welcoming melodies. “I might as well be over the moon,” María Zardoya’s welcoming voice croons over a gentle beat and reverb laden synths, inviting the listener in. Add a groovy guitar solo to the concoction, and “Over the Moon” is the perfect track to finish off the night.

"Is this how everybody who is different feels?" asks Trisha Lee, a white religious working-class widow and the titular character of the SpeakEasy Stage Company’s “The Pink Unicorn.” “Sittin’ at a table with not one person you can relate to or connect with, like you ain’t never gonna be understood, like nobody is ever gonna hold you and love you for who you are? It is the loneliest feeling in the world,” she concludes. Trisha, played by Stacy Fischer, is forced to reckon with her own beliefs and values when her teenager, Jo, comes out as genderqueer. Trisha becomes a determined ally, and armed with Wikipedia, takes on the local church and Jo’s conservative high school. “The Pink Unicorn” is streaming through March 18.
From the beginning, the performance is welcoming and intimate. Trisha sits in a cozy kitchen with a sign reading “BLESSED” hanging over the door. She speaks directly to the viewer, creating the illusion that you are sitting in her kitchen as she recounts her story. The warm lighting, flower-patterned tablecloth, and checkered curtains create an environment that feels less like a staged play and more like a conversation between friends, and it’s easy to be drawn into Trisha’s world. The production subtly communicates that, while large displays of activism can be effective, intimate conversations like these are just as important.
Fischer also embodies Trisha’s sharp, scathing humor with deftness. While Trisha is initially polite and straight-laced, she soon reveals herself to be opinionated, scathing, and petty. At one point, Fischer adopts an ultra-masculine, swaggering persona as she imitates her local pastor’s brash, homophobic tirades. The pastor’s name? Pastor Dick.
The play’s lightheartedness is matched by moments of introspection. Trisha’s evocative descriptions of her own relationship with gender as a child take the viewer on an emotional journey far beyond her kitchen. While asking herself how Jo could possibly be genderqueer, as they had not exhibited any gender-nonconforming behaviors as a child, Trisha reveals that she herself had once reveled in expressing herself in some conventionally masculine ways. As she describes climbing trees and taking off her shirt to play, her voice rises and she gesticulates, so much more animated than the prim, proper housewife she normally appears to be. Trisha asks herself, “Who would I be now, if I had kept my boy close?” It’s a moment of wistful regret, of unresolved what-might-be. Trisha’s nostalgia speaks to a topic not often discussed: If older people had had the same words and tools as younger generations, would they have come out, too?
Ultimately, the show’s greatest contribution is the empathy it affords Trisha. Her narrative provides a window into the other side of a coming-out story: the confused parent struggling to understand their child’s identity (or identities), while trying to protect them. In real life, it may be easy to dismiss parents like Trisha as small-minded. But, by giving Trisha the stage, the production not only explores the messiness that can come with such a disclosure but also encourages audiences to understand and empathize with Trisha, as well as Jo.
Unfortunately, along with these heartfelt moments, the play is also plagued by instances of fatphobia and ableism. Trisha takes every possible opportunity to ridicule Enid, an older lesbian activist. She also belittles another character’s speech and use of a wheelchair, and only recants these jabs after the character is revealed to be a skilled community organizer. The performance’s lack of other viewpoints means that Trisha’s comments go unquestioned, and an uncomfortable contradiction exists: While Trisha moves slowly closer towards supporting her child’s identity, she blithely continues to ridicule other marginalized groups. Without another voice to counter her, the show runs the risk of elevating certain marginalized voices at the expense of further belittling others.
Trisha also misgenders Jo throughout the play, only using their correct pronouns in the show’s last four minutes. She also only does this after giving a sardonic little smile — as though to let the audience know it’s difficult for her. The catalyst for this shift is unclear, and feels more like a narrative device to show that Trisha is “changing” than the product of any internal realization. This has the potential to make audiences feel uncomfortable and alienated. Admittedly, SpeakEasy Stage Company includes a content advisory for transphobia, misgendering, ableist, and fatphobic language on its ticketing website. However, this misgendering directly flies in the face of the play’s attempts to create a theatrical space for kindness and understanding.
In the last minutes of the play, a disembodied voice yells “Mom!” out of range of the camera. Trisha smiles and gets up to help her child, and the play ends happily. However, this line relegates Jo to a symbol, rather than a flesh-and-blood person. One wonders what possibilities might have arisen had Jo been given a voice alongside Trisha. Instead, they are relegated to a symbol of their mother’s personal growth.
Overall, “The Pink Unicorn” spotlights a perspective less often heard, and raises important questions about the obligations of parents who have BGLTQ children. However, this is also the play’s greatest weakness: by centering a non-BGLTQ person and allowing her complete authority over the telling of her BGLTQ child’s story, these messages of empathy and kindness often feel hollow.

Carving out a life in the Wild West might leave little room for keeping up with news from across the land. “There is no time for stories,” says a melancholy farmer near the climax of director Paul Greengrass’s “News of the World.” Yet even after fending off lawless bandits, old age, and the untamed elements, a cowboy-hat toting Tom Hanks would beg to differ.
Greengrass' flick follows the perilous journey of a Civil War veteran and an orphaned child across the harsh late-nineteenth century Texas desert. Though it is not entirely without excitement, the film seems to share many qualities with its two central characters: tired, a little dusty, and searching for a place to call home in an environment that favors the capable and action-inclined. Yet an emotional wisdom shines through the travelers’ unassuming dispositions, and the film surprises viewers in a similar way. “News of the World” transcends its modest Western derivation to deliver a poignant tale about building connections where humanity is scarce, affirming the beauty and importance of storytelling along the way.
Lacking a particularly broad or nuanced cast and spotlighting two of the frontier’s less romantic inhabitants, "News of the World" feels simple compared to other action-packed blockbusters within the Western genre. The film centers on Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Tom Hanks) — an ex-Confederate soldier reading news aloud to townsfolk across Texas who gather for his nightly presentations. While en route to the next town, Kidd stumbles across Johanna (Helena Zengel) — an orphaned girl being escorted to distant family, incapable of speaking English. Johanna’s wagon driver was lynched by still-bitter Confederate locals, and Kidd is informed the Union can’t provide immediate shelter for her. Seeing no alternative, Kidd volunteers to transport her himself.
For the townsfolk to whom Kidd reads, news of the world means news from around Texas; what doesn’t affect them is not of great importance. Yet the film successfully illuminates a great deal of period-specific topics within this small setting. Farmers and laymen, vested in work clothes and crowded into candlelit taverns, express outrage at news of Union troops’ extended stay in the South. Boasts from unscrupulous opportunists reveal the grim extent of bison-hunting operations in the West. Even Johanna’s complicated backstory speaks to the turbulence of frontier life: Born to German immigrants, raised by the Kiowa Native Americans who slew them, and orphaned once more when her Kiowa family was in turn murdered, Johanna is a child of the territorial violence spawned by American Westward expansion. Kidd roams from town to humble town, traversing miles of empty plains in between; yet Greengrass and fellow screenwriter Luke Davies manage to weave a rich and immersive historical narrative into the film, seamlessly dropping viewers into a tumultuous era of American history.
These historical movements, no matter how dynamic, are less easily appreciated when first observing Kidd and Johanna’s rather cliché relationship — a predictable if not completely banal development as the two bridge gaps in language and age. Two stubborn, trauma-hardened souls begrudgingly accept each other’s company only to realize the true value of said company after enduring countless trials together, becoming unlikely allies. Sprinkle in a dash of mutual reckoning with past demons and Wild West-themed obstacles, and “News of the World” delivers a lesson best served lukewarm: The journey is more important than the destination.
Yet there’s something decidedly welcome about the gentle nature of a message so trite. Between viewing the dried blood splatters of Johanna’s parents and the gruesome aftermath of her wagon driver’s lynching, “News of the World” pulls no punches. Viewers must find respite from the brutality of the frontier in the characters’ playful attempts to translate English to Kiowa and a charming dispute over how to ration sugar — scenes that would have otherwise been considered dull and unnecessary. These distinct moments of intimacy are accentuated by a contrast between the large, unforgiving world and its lonely, mortal inhabitants. Sweeping panoramic shots of the desert serve to intimidate and impose, while close ups on Kidd’s weathered hands and Johanna’s steely eyes allow viewers to admire the sliver of humanity managing to get by — his hands a little shaky, but deliberate; her eyes a little weary, but attentive. The unsteady camera work highlights this humanity: Kidd and Johanna will undoubtedly struggle, yet they continue to move forward with gritty determination. It is the resolve of two small people in the face of myriad threats that renders their journey worthy of our attention.
Audiences familiar with director Paul Greengrass may recognize techniques like shaky camera work as staples of his filmography — an oeuvre of frantically-paced hits like “Captain Phillips.” Shaky footage and twinkly-eyed Tom Hanks aside, viewers find in “News of the World” a subtle departure from Greengrass’s earlier work. Even the action present in the film pales in comparison to such hyper-focused sequences as a Jason Bourne fistfight or “United 93”’s passenger revolt. “News of the World” is instead much more attuned to its hauntingly beautiful Western atmosphere, accommodating the breadth and magnitude of the plains in such a way as to make the efforts of the film’s protagonists all the more impressive. More natural and less frenzied, “News of the World”’s cinematography represents a skillful stylistic adaptation to accommodate a new environment for Greengrass.
Kidd and Johanna’s story is quite similar to those in the local papers that Kidd reads — small, fleeting, isolated. It may not resonate with those beyond rural Texas, but the combined wisdom of Kidd’s battle-tested heart and Johanna’s child-like intuition tells us that’s okay. Even the smallest tales — and sometimes especially the smallest tales — have value. Whether it’s an update on the activities of neighbors in the next town over or a blossoming relationship between unlikely survivors of the Wild West gauntlet, “News of the World” reminds us that there’s always time for a story.

I’ve never wanted to be a Princess. Mostly because I never truly thought I could be one.
I remember the first time I saw Tiana. She looked like me. It was 2009 and for the first time, Disney gave little Black girls their first taste of what it was like for the fairest of them all to be Black.
Tiana exemplified the epitome of what life told us it meant to be a strong Black woman: responsible, a bit sassy, and dedicated to her family. She was fiercely independent, with a story that sung a soulful song of the honor and pressure felt by Black women to fulfill the dreams of their loved ones, safeguard their culture, and place the needs of others before their own.
Our princess — with beautiful cocoa flesh, a wide nose, and slicked up hair — charmed all of the little Black girls and grown Black women who longed to see a princess they could relate to grace the screen. We tried to be hopeful witnessing the first “Black princess” in pixels. But we were very quickly reminded that the world refuses to view us with such grandeur.
She was a frog for most of the movie.
Thus, at seven years old, I was faced with the reality that Black women and girls are always strong, resilient, and magical, but even in the mythical realm of Disney movies, we are often left little room to be human. So, I skipped over childhood dreams of becoming a princess because for little girls like me, I knew it meant that my real-life character arc would fall short of a whimsical tale. Unlike the Auroras, Belles, and Cinderellas of the world, my “fairytale” was destined to be disrupted by an animalistic coming to princessdom.
How could I be a princess if the world couldn’t fathom me as human?
I remember the first time the media announced that the second son of the people’s princess was to be married. To a Black woman. I was getting a do-over. A real life princess was made up of half the same stuff as me. Like Tiana, she is responsible, sassy, dedicated to her family, and fiercely independent. And because this was real life and I was now 17, I was sure she’d be a princess that nobody could turn into a frog, whose growth and character would not be entrapped by slimy mucus-drenched skin in a body that didn’t belong to her.
And again, Black women tried to be hopeful witnessing the first “Black princess” in real life. But we were quickly confronted with the reality that the rest of the world wouldn’t watch cheerfully alongside us.
The British press conjured up defamatory headlines and pieces with racial undertones. The family Meghan Markle married sent her to photo-ops and royal engagements while they whispered their concerns about the potential darkness of her unborn child’s skin. She was vilified and slowly deprived of her humanity, as though she were some undesirable creature whose “exotic” DNA would plague the royal family.
Black American women lay awake at night sending hushed prayers into the universe for Meghan’s emotional and physical safety. We were afraid because we knew better than to believe that the colorism that opened the doors would shield her from the anti-Blackness that would ultimately throw her out. We know better than to believe that our princess could ever truly be considered royal, especially knowing that the world fears any ounce of Blackness that threatens to permeate its perfectly constructed white castles. In fact, some would kill us over it.
When Prince Harvard bestowed upon me a fateful kiss, I’d hoped that I could slay the villains that had robbed me of the fantastical dreams of Black princessdom. But the truth is, both inside and outside of this white castle, that this little Black girl cannot want to be a princess, mostly because she knows the world would never let her be one.
When we die, nobody says our names. Nobody cries at our funerals. Harvard doesn’t offer commiseration. What’s more, though, is that when we’re living the world would rather see us contorted and distorted in pixels and in person — holding our breath until we reach the brink of death — than hold us in high regard.
I know we don’t need titles or the world’s permission to be royalty. Black women will still rise. We are royalty in our own right. But the “fairytales” written for princesses that look like me have always insinuated that the happy endings never come unless we first let the world strip us of our skin and morph us into something, or someone, we can barely recognize — all while fighting the scariest of villains, the darkest of demons, and the centuries of violence at the hands of misogynoir.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In late February, Students for Fair Admissions pointedly reopened a closed case. After filing suit against Harvard in 2014, the anti-affirmative action group suffered decisive losses in both the Massachusetts District Court and the First Circuit Court when arguing that Harvard’s race-conscious admissions system violates the Civil Rights Act. Now, SFFA President Edward J. Blum is striving to reignite these efforts by working to push SFFA’s case into the Supreme Court docket, with the explicit intent of overturning Grutter v. Bollinger — a landmark Supreme Court case sanctioning affirmative action.
Beyond his involvement with SFFA, Blum has long been known for his interest in lawsuits that grapple with questions of minority protections. After losing a congressional race to a Black Democrat in the 1990s, Blum challenged the Texas redistricting process in Bush v. Vera, which ultimately led the state to redraw its congressional districts. In Shelby County v. Holder, Blum successfully petitioned to strike down a section of the Voting Rights Act that provided for preclearance: a form of federal review that actively increased minority turnout and sought to improve minority representation in Congress. And in Fisher v. University of Texas, Blum argued that the University of Texas’s race-conscious admissions policies were unconstitutional. It is within this context that we must work to understand SFFA’s aims — with its recent petition simply serving as the latest iteration of Blum’s ongoing efforts to undermine minority protections nationwide.
What is perhaps most pernicious about this lawsuit is SFFA’s exploitation of the genuine racism that Asian Americans endure. During their initial court proceedings, SFFA’s contracted economist found that Asian American applicants were consistently rated lower than other racial groups on their personality during the Harvard admissions process. While SFFA leveraged this evidence as proof that Harvard penalized Asian American applicants based on race, Harvard instead claimed that these ratings reflected Asian students’ less supportive recommendation letters from counselors and teachers — a key input to the personality score. In either case, such findings are reflective of deeply rooted, racially biased societal norms and attitudes, ones that permeate students’ lived realities far before their applications are ever reviewed by Harvard admissions. And yet, somehow, SFFA believes that the answer to such troubles, clearly based in racism, lies not in actively combatting their sordid roots, but instead in removing race from the admissions picture entirely.
It is through this disjointedness that SFFA’s motivations become fundamentally clear: The group has pinpointed real issues of Asian American discrimination out of self-interest, not care — leveraging societal injustices to pursue their own interests while doing nothing to address their most damaging origins.
We also take particular offense to Blum’s tacit insinuation that Harvard’s Black, Latinx, and Native American students are in some way less deserving of their place at Harvard than their white and Asian peers. At the most basic level, students are admitted to the College based on the belief that they will grace Harvard’s intellectual community and thrive within it — and no student deserves to be denied that confidence and promise. Beyond that, systemic racism has dampened minority group access to everything from educational access to vocational opportunities. The race-conscious nature of Harvard admissions simply seeks to recognize these realities — and even still, it does not even begin to alleviate them.
If Blum were actually concerned about discrimination against Asian American applicants, he would argue for a more expansive form of affirmative action — one that evaluates Asian American applicants on new measures, or demands that their personal ratings be calculated differently. Instead, Blum’s race-neutral alternatives to Harvard’s admissions process almost guarantee that Black and Latinx groups will see drops in representation to the tune of more than 1,000 fewer students after four years.
Blum has made a career out of arm twisting judges into eroding the rights of African Americans under the premise that racism has no bearing on the workings of modern institutions. But the justices on the Supreme Court must not allow SFFA to add affirmative action to the list of civil rights laws slashed in an effort to trivialize the omnipresence of racism in American society. Instead, for the sake of truly fair admissions, students’ most fundamental civil protections must be preserved.

Spanning around 3,700 courses, Harvard’s more than 50 undergraduate concentrations give students at the College numerous paths to a broad liberal arts education.
Behind the scenes, however, these concentrations are not all alike in structure and administration.
In addition to the full departments under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, 10 nondepartmental degree programs overseen by Standing Committees of the FAS offer undergraduate concentrations. Each curricular committee has been established by a vote of the faculty to perform a specific continuing function, according to Harvard’s Office of the Secretary’s website.
These curricular committees are not structured like ordinary departments. The committees consist of professors and Head Tutors who offer tutorials, set concentration requirements, and occasionally administer final exams and judge theses and general examinations. They are supported by staff and affiliated faculty.
The undergraduate concentrations overseen by these committees — rather than by a full department — span all three FAS divisions: Sciences, Social Sciences, and Arts and Humanities, plus the Committee on Special Concentrations overseen by the College.
Some popular concentrations under Standing Committees include Chemical and Physical Biology, History and Literature, and Social Studies.
Both faculty on these committees and students under these concentrations acknowledge the unique characteristics of pursuing one’s studies under such an administration. They noted these committees can allow undergraduates greater flexibility in requirements and more intimate academic support from faculty, but also recognized that the freedom to customize can leave them more isolated from peers.
Faculty and students alike said committee concentrations, mostly smaller in size, create tight-knit student-faculty relationships and more independence for undergraduates.
Caroline Light, the Director of Undergraduate Studies for one of those committees — Women, Gender, and Sexuality — said not having an independent doctoral program means that the “central constituency” of the committee is undergraduates.
“We really do get to focus so much of our attention and energy on producing a strong curriculum,” she said.
Students in committee concentrations said they have reaped the benefits of this close supervision. Elizabeth S. Propst ’22-’23, an English concentrator with a secondary in Comparative Religion — which is administered by the Committee on the Study of Religion — explained that she feels close ties to her committee.
“The small size and flexibility means that in Comparative Religion you can kind of do whatever you’re drawn to and you’ll have unconditional support,” she said. “I think the nice part of that too is that you feel really heard and really a part of a process of creating the department's community, instead of just a 20-year-old who walks in and walks out four years later.”
Michael B. Baick ’22 added that History and Literature has been fast-acting and sensitive in responding to the needs of students.
“I think that Hist and Lit is extremely responsive to student interests in a way that other departments might not be,” he said.
In the Social Studies concentration, which attracts approximately 250 students every year, students propose a unique focus field, and decide their course of study with minimal general requirements.
Social Studies concentrator Rumi M. A. Khan ’21 explained that Social Studies also allows students to customize their courses to align with their academic curiosities.
“I think that the biggest pro of Social Studies is that you can really have a customized, specialized, and almost intellectually intimate experience because you basically are the only person doing what you do,” he said.
“You’re still steering your own ship, and it’s certainly not what maybe an Econ or Physics concentrator could say,” added Khan, who is pursuing a secondary in Math, a large full department.
Khan said he and many of his peers chose to study Social Studies after they took popular Harvard courses, such as Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” or Government 20: “Foundations of Comparative Politics”, and felt that they inadequately addressed interdisciplinary studies. The Social Studies concentration, on the other hand, allows students to study a problem or question from multiple perspectives, he argued.
“You’re not interested in a feat in an academic discipline, you’re interested in a problem,” Khan said.
Celtic Languages and Literatures professor Joseph F. Nagy ’74, interim chair of the Committee on Folklore and Mythology, also lauded the freedom that a committee concentration can provide.
“I like the fact that it’s not a department,” he said. “True, it perhaps makes you less visible than a department, it gives you something that perhaps has less it can claim as its own resources than a department, but it also gives you a certain freedom.”
The number of undergraduates concentrating within these degree committees vary greatly. Students expressed gratitude for the close relationships they established with faculty on the committees.
“While the drawback is that you lack the ability to walk into the next room and see a Nobel Prize winner,” Khan said. “On the other hand, you can walk into the next room and the person will actually talk to you — that’s huge.”
Students concentrating within these committees noted it can be more difficult to connect with peers due to the individualistic nature of their studies.
Khan drew comparisons to departments such as Physics or Government in which undergraduates may overlap in many classes due to the more rigid concentration requirements.
“The sacrifice for being individualized, having that customizable of a curriculum, is you lose the kind of cohort experience that I think a lot of other concentrations might go through,” he said.
Baick also said the personalized nature of each student’s program can sometimes make it difficult to choose courses, but the committee members are “so approachable” that support is not difficult to find.
Students and faculty also acknowledged there can be several disadvantages to a nondepartmental concentration, such as less administrative backing when registering for courses in other departments, as well as a lack of name recognition among prospective concentrators.
“There are some times when not having that departmental scaffolding can be tough, especially getting into a competitive English seminar, for example,” Baick said. “There are definitely disadvantages to not always having that really strong environmental infrastructure.”
Light said many freshmen never encountered courses in women, gender, and sexuality studies in high school, and thus would not be immediately drawn to the concentration. To address this, WGS has used its more broadly-offered courses to increase visibility among undergraduates.
“GenEd is a massive draw for us, because we have a lot of courses in GenEd,” she said.
Baick argued History and Literature also distinguished itself among concentrations by creating an ethnic studies track. Harvard students have pushed for a formal ethnic studies department for nearly five decades.
He also noted that History and Literature’s entire Tutorial Board is made up of non-tenure-track faculty.
“I think the amount of turnover is frustrating, and this is what happens when the university does not give all the support it could to the committee,” Baick said.
“I’ve built some great relationships with people who have left, and that’s really tough,” he said. “In the life of an academic, the job is simply not a well-supported enough one to stick around.”
Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey did not respond to a request for comment regarding the tenure status of History and Literature faculty.
Faculty and students had varying visions for the future of their standing committees, including on whether they might eventually become departments.
Nagy said that he is happy with the current state of the Folklore and Mythology committee.
“I’m sure it’s always wonderful to expand to have even more concentrators, to have the resources with which we teach our courses, and to offer courses,” Nagy said. “But I think actually, we are well positioned and we are looked upon favorably by the powers that be.”
“We try very hard, and we do try to uphold the larger agenda of arts and humanities,” he added.
Khan gave predictions for how Social Studies could change if it expanded into a department.
“I think the main issue with Social Studies becoming its own department is that I feel, if it were its own department, it would immediately be eclipsed by sociology or history,” Khan said. “Or any of the five fields that it draws from.”
Light said one obstacle to becoming a department is the dearth of academic positions in women and gender studies nationwide, which would limit the prospects of students who graduated from such a department. The “economic devastation” of the pandemic has already forced Harvard to cut graduate department admissions, which will reduce the number of graduate students taking WGS classes, she noted.
“Another consequence of economic devastation is that many institutions all the way across the board have fewer full-time tenure-track positions to fill, which means that these brilliant doctoral students at Harvard have fewer job opportunities when they graduate,” she said.
Light added, however, it is not up to the committee to make budgetary decisions or determinations on its structure.
“Every now and then, in the decade that I’ve been here, there have been rumblings about how WGS will become a department,” she said. “But ultimately it is up to central administration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Award-winning actress Nia T. Long discussed her artistry as an actress and her experiences as a Black woman in the film industry during a webinar hosted by the Harvard Black Men’s Forum Monday.
Entitled “Artistry & Black Womanhood with Nia Long,” the event was held in celebration of Women’s History Month and drew a crowd of over 130 Harvard affiliates.
Throughout her career, Long has starred in films and TV shows such as “Boyz n the Hood,” “The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,” and “The Best Man.” In 2020, she produced her first film, “Fatal Affair,” which premiered as the top-streamed film on Netflix in its debut weekend.
Long said that her work ethic is inspired by her “hardworking” grandparents — who moved to New York City with just “nine thousand dollars in their pocket” — and to her mother, who helped to jumpstart her acting career.
“They instilled in me very early on that it didn’t matter what I wanted to do but that anything was possible,” Long said. “I come from a group of very strong women.”
Still, Long said breaking into acting was difficult, especially as a Black woman. Even after receiving a scholarship for an acting class and finding an agent, she said her artistic journey was a challenge.
“I went on tons of auditions and I was told, ‘You’re too short, you’re too Black, you’re too light, your eyebrows are too thick, you’re too skinny, you’re too fat, you’re not pretty enough,’” Long said.
Long also addressed the underrepresentation of Black people and women in acting, producing, and directing roles in Hollywood, citing the challenges she encountered with “Fatal Affair.”
The script of “Fatal Affair” was written for an all-white cast, according to Long, who produced and starred in the film. Nevertheless, Long took on the project and said she helped to diversify the cast.
“If white men are running the country, you think they’re going to be in a hurry to go, ‘Oh yeah, let’s tell some stories about Black people, especially Black women?’ It’s just not happening,” Long said. “The only way this changes is if we start to produce, direct, and continue to write our own stories.”
Chinaza K. Asiegbu ’22 said after “hearing Long’s words of wisdom,” she left the event feeling inspired and hopeful for the future.
“In the industry, we idolize people of her stature and people of her status and think that they’re not human, but I just appreciated how human she was,” Asiegbu said. “[Long] made sure to resonate with us and let us know as students who are going through our respective industries that we have a chance.”
Asiegbu also said Long’s discussion about self-care and self-love was relatable, especially as a Black woman and student.
“We are always prioritizing somebody else or somebody else’s feelings,” Asiegbu said. “It’s actually a miracle that Black women are always looking so young with the way that we put energy and time into so many things outside of ourselves.”
Long concluded with words of advice and lessons she learned throughout her professional and personal arc.
“As you walk through this life, pick up the pieces and put them in your pocket,” she said. “Because you’re not going to find everything in one place, and there’s no straight road to success — pick up the pieces and put them in your pocket.”

When the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. last March, K-12 institutions struggled to rapidly adapt to an online format.
Over a year has passed since that initial transition, and experts in education policy, administration, and public health say the new challenge is safely shepherding students back into classrooms — and making the most of this pivotal moment.
In interviews with The Crimson, experts argued the transition back to in-person instruction is both possible and deeply necessary, though it will require strong safety protocols and student compliance — especially as teachers and school staff await their vaccines.
Paul Reville, a Professor of Practice of Educational Policy and Administration at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said the pandemic has been “enormously challenging” for teachers, school administrators, students, and families.
Amid continuing calls for school reopenings, he said the challenge of rebuilding relationships is compromised by months of virtual education.
“It’s had a significant effect on relationships,” he said. “It's fractured relationships between students and their schools, between students and teachers and students with one another,”
HGSE professor Meira Levinson said school re-openings have been uneven thus far, explaining that disadvantaged children are likely to be trapped longer in the era of remote learning.
“Low income people of color tend to live in more dense housing, tend to have access to worse medical care, are contracting Covid at higher rates, have more serious outcomes, including a higher risk of death,” she said. “Therefore, [they] are quite reasonably not sending their kids back to school.”
She added the divide between them and more privileged families will worsen if school reopenings are not handled with equity in mind. .
“It is very, very likely that it is more historically privileged families who are going to be taking advantage of reopening schools, and more historically marginalized and vulnerable families who are going to keep their kids virtual, and that in itself will also exacerbate inequities and systemic injustices.”
Similarly, Reville said he is concerned with growing educational inequities among students.
“There have been very substantial equity challenges in all of this,” said Reville. “If we had gaps, and we did have profound gaps in our ability and performance in serving our students prior to the pandemic, the gaps have even grown greater—the achievement gaps, the opportunity gaps, the inspiration gaps that affect young people.”
Fracturing relationships and growing inequalities present clear challenges for continuing virtual education. Experts, however, said students can indeed safely return to schools with the proper protocols in place.
Katharine O. Strunk, an education policy professor at Michigan State University, said she studied research on the effects of school reopenings on Covid-19 transmission rates in the states of Michigan and Washington. Strunk said schools that deploy social distancing and operate at a capacity below 75 percent do not appear to fuel Covid spread in the surrounding area.
Barry R. Bloom, an immunology and infectious disease professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, said there are already plans for Massachusetts schools to begin the re-opening process this semester.
“The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has set a target for April 5th, where they will open lower school levels, which have the least risk and the greatest need for the students to be socialized, and begin all the basic learning skills that they will need,” he said. “That will be followed in a couple of weeks by junior high school people. And that will be followed later at the end of April by high school students.”
Bloom said lower school levels made sense as a first target, since young children are more “compliant” when it comes to wearing masks, and are also less likely to spread the disease — both critical factors to keep teachers safe until they get vaccinated.
Joseph G. Allen, a professor of exposure assessment science at the HSPH, said the country has the tools to reopen schools now — and certainly by the fall.
“There's no question that K-12 schools should be open full time in September,” he said. “If that doesn't happen, it'll be the grossest of failings of our country.”
As schools are poised to reopen, experts said the country should take advantage of this pivotal moment to re-examine and modify our model of education.
Jal D. Mehta ’99, a professor at HGSE, said he believes it is necessary to “reinvent” schools and continue the pedagogical innovation jump-started by the pandemic. He noted some students have not only enjoyed learning online, but have functioned better at home because of it.
“Schools pre-pandemic weren't working well for lots of students,” Mehta said. “There's data that shows that about 75 percent of fifth graders report being engaged in schools and about 32 percent of 11th graders report similarly being engaged in schools.”
Essentially, the longer students are in school, the less engaged they feel,” he said.
Mehta said he believes problems in the pre-pandemic education system, such as a lack of engagement in learning, should be revised as students flock back to classrooms.
“I don't think it will be automatic or seismic, but I think that you'll see a lot of small reinventions in different places and maybe that can crystallize into something bigger,” Mehta said.
Reville said schools should continue the process of pedagogical reflection and reform initiated by the pandemic.
“We’re operating a factory model of education that we designed in the early 20th century, and no longer is it effective at meeting the needs of the wide range of students we serve,” he said.
“We need a personalized system, something that individualizes and customizes attention to each student, a system that meets children where they are and gives them what they need, both inside and outside of school,” Reville added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed a policy order adding a provision to Cambridge’s Municipal Code explicitly restricting the use of tear gas in the city, while also voting down an order that would reinstate capacity restrictions for indoor dining in restaurants.
Following a tense debate at last week’s council meeting, Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler presented new ordinance language explicitly banning the use of tear gas and other chemical agents by Cambridge government entities — including the Cambridge Police Department. Other cities including Berkeley, Calif. and Philadelphia already passed tear gas bans, and Boston and Somerville, Mass. are set to do so as well in the coming weeks, according to Sobrinho-Wheeler.
“They’ve all passed ordinances to make sure that any city policy change would require a majority of the city council to allow tear gas again,” he said.
The council unanimously passed this policy order, which will be sent to the Ordinance Committee for further discussion.
Tear gas has not been deployed in Cambridge since the 1970s, and while the Cambridge Police Department currently does not possess tear gas or authorize the use of it, the department does not explicitly ban it either.
Earlier that day, CPD Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr., who said at last week’s meeting he had “no problem” with a tear gas ban, filed a departmental policy “prohibiting the acquisition, possession, discharge, and/or authorization to discharge tear gas or any other related chemical weapon for all members of the Department.”
The policy has been sent to both police unions for review and is set to go in effect on March 29.
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale also presented the weekly update on the city’s pandemic response at the meeting.
As of March 11, the Cambridge city vaccination program expanded “Phase Two” eligibility to “Group Three” individuals, which include K-12 educators, K-12 school staff, and child care workers. Including those in “Phase One” groups, the city has administered 2,289 doses of Moderna vaccine and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude A. Jacob said the city public health department is working to ramp up its homebound vaccination program.
“While the number of residents is relatively small and the project will require significant effort, it is extremely important because there are people who would likely die if they were to be infected,” Jacob said. “We know that this is a very vulnerable population.
Cambridge is continuing to move forward with its phased reopening plan, and with “Phase Three, Step Two” in progress, capacity limits currently are set at 50 percent across the city. DePasquale cited the city’s favorable case numbers as evidence for the decision to maintain reopening.
“Our collective efforts have helped keep Cambridge at one of the lowest positivity rates of any city of its size in the state, if not the lowest,” DePasquale said.
According to DePasquale, the Cambridge Public Health Department has not observed case clusters attributed to indoor dining — a finding which contradicts statements from Jacob at last week’s council meeting.
“With regard to indoor dining, what we'd like to see is the change in our dining out culture where the pandemic is under control,” Jacob said at the time.
The failed policy order, which attempted to reimpose capacity restrictions for restaurants, was met with opposition from all the councilors except the three who co-sponsored it: Quinton Y. Zondervan, Dennis J. Carlone, and Sobrinho-Wheeler.
“There is no basis for this policy order to exist tonight,” Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said.
Cambridge previously delayed its “Phase Three, Step Two” reopening plan back in October. Zondervan, however, questioned why the city would move ahead with this new phase now, with the city seeing around 16 to 17 new Covid-19 cases a day, compared to around three a day in October.
Sobrinho-Wheeler, another co-sponsor of the policy order, cited the city’s Covid-19 Expert Advisory Panel’s recent report which “expressed strong concern about recent state and local reopening decisions,” specifically restaurants and other indoor areas. He also referenced the Cambridge Public Health department’s observation that many indoor diners do not wear their masks when they are not actively eating or drinking.
Mallon, however, pointed out that previously lifting capacity restrictions did not allow most restaurants to increase their seating capacity, as they still had to adhere to the six-foot distancing of tables.
“I will be encouraging the motion-maker, again, to please reach out to city departments prior to putting policy orders in, to get the facts before they bring them to the city council for discussion,” Mallon said.
“The entire city and our small business community, our small restaurant community, is watching and waiting and hoping for guidance from us,” she added.

Fifteen months after its own strike, the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers has thrown its support behind another student strike — this time, at Columbia University.
Student workers at Harvard said they have taken to social media, donated to a strike fund, and picketed — both virtually and in-person — as the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Automobile Workers went on strike Monday.
Ege Yumusak ’16, a member of HGSU-UAW, also sent a union-wide email in support of the GWC-UAW, which began its strike after two years of bargaining without a contract.
“Text your friends at Columbia, follow them and tweet in support, tell them that we are one union (#1u) in solidarity, because we’re counting on them to win a strong contract,” she wrote. “As student workers, we must support each other in order to push our movement forward.”
Graduate students at Columbia have long been at the forefront of graduate student organizing.
In 2015, GWC-UAW submitted its petition to unionize to the National Labor Relations Board, which adjusticates labor disputes brought by unions or individual employees. A ruling in their favor in 2016 declared that graduate students at private universities are employees and have the right to unionize.
HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla wrote in an emailed statement Columbia’s push for unionization was “crucial” in helping to establish academic workers’ rights at universities.
“The Columbia 2016 NLRB decision, in particular, paved the way for contract victories in higher ed — including ours,” he wrote. “It's about time Columbia student workers also won a contract.”
The union and Columbia continue to disagree on five points — union recognition, union shop, grievance and arbitration procedure for harassment and discrimination, protections for international student workers, and compensation and health benefits.
A spokesperson for Columbia University wrote that they are “committed” to a “full and fair contract,” and “remain confident of that outcome, notwithstanding this unnecessary and unfortunate work stoppage.”
On March 10, GWC-UAW notified its membership that Columbia University will not pay striking workers and demanded strikers repay part of their financial aid stipends. In response, Columbia undergraduate students organized a strike fund to help support strikers. The fund has raised over $60,000 thus far.
On the first day of the strike, both students and local politicians joined the union on the picket line, according to Susannah E. Glickman, an organizer with the GWC-UAW.
“It’s really exciting to see the energy,” she said. “It's awesome to see everyone coming out to support us.”
Yumusak was one of those supporters. Traveling to the picket line, she said she was “very proud” of Columbia’s graduate students.
“They are out there in the cold, doing Covid-safe picketing,” she said. “Some of them can’t get to the picket line, so they’re doing virtual picketing. It’s really amazing. This is the frontier of digital organizing, digital labor action, as well as in-person labor action.”
For their virtual picketing session, the union urged participants to call and email Columbia administrators. The online effort also featured a teach-in by professors and students studying social movements and labor.
Glickman said GWC-UAW also looked to HGSU-UAW, who went on strike in December 2019, and the University of Michigan’s Graduate Employees Organization, who went on strike in September 2020, as inspirations.
“We definitely looked to the example of Harvard when it went on strike and Michigan, who went on strike during the pandemic, as models,” Glickman said.
Andrew M. Leber, a steward for HGSU-UAW, said that members of HGSU-UAW have been “in touch” with members of GWC-UAW for “quite some time,” since the movements at both schools have been “proceeding in a rough parallel for some time now.”
Besides resorting to strikes after months at the negotiation table, Leber noted that both unions have tried and failed to incorporate third party arbitration of identity-based harassment claims into their contracts.
Leber said he has donated to the strike fund and plans on circulating information to fellow Harvard graduate students on how to assist the Columbia strikers.
“Given that there are relatively few private university student worker unions, what happens to any one of us or any one unionization effort has implications for all of us,” he said.
Erik Baker, another HGSU-UAW member, said he has also donated to the strike fund and promoted the strike on social media. He recalled receiving support from other unions, including the GWC-UAW, when he was on strike.
“I think that a lot of people feel like we got an outpouring of support from other grad unions including Columbia GWC at the time, so now it’s our turn to return the favor,” Baker said. “In our case, our strike really helped ultimately bring us to a resolution a few months afterwards, and I certainly hope for the same outcome here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 16, 2021 at 5:40 p.m.
A committee charged with reviewing the role of preceptors and senior preceptors within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences released a report early this month reaffirming its stance on time-capping appointments for the non-tenured positions, prompting disappointment among preceptors in various departments.
Convened by FAS Dean Claudine Gay in fall 2019, the committee concluded its work and submitted its report to Gay in May 2020, though the findings were only shared with preceptors this month. The report includes several recommendations, such as standardizing course loads for preceptors, as well as affirmations of existing policies, such as maintaining the term caps that have drawn criticism from preceptors in the past.
The FAS hires preceptors with a time cap of three, five, or eight years, after which the faculty are required to leave Harvard no matter the quality of their performance. Senior preceptors, however, are not subject to the time caps.
Expository Writing preceptor Margaret Doherty said she objected to the report’s framing of preceptors and senior preceptors as “just teaching positions.”
“It’s important to recognize that even though this report frames preceptors as teachers, and I see myself as a teacher in a really fundamental way, I don’t really think you can separate teaching and scholarship and writing in the way that the report tries to do,” Doherty said. “That really cuts against what Harvard says about its intellectual environment, which is that all of these things — teaching, research, writing — all inform each other, all go hand in hand.”
Salma A. Ayyash, a preceptor in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement that she “questioned” the administration’s commitment to increasing professional development for preceptors, which the committee report presented as a task to be facilitated through the Bok Center.
“One of my major concerns is that professional development and pedagogical support is kind of an optional path during the preceptor journey,” Ayyash wrote. “Putting that heavy lifting on the Bok Center is expecting too much of one center with limited staff to address an important aspect of the preceptor role.”
The committee — headed by Romance Languages and Literatures professor Diana Sorensen — included faculty members from across the divisions of the FAS, along with SEAS. Notably, however, the committee did not contain any preceptors or senior preceptors.
In an emailed statement, Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser wrote the committee had planned outreach meetings “with units across the FAS,” including departments chairs for areas with high numbers of preceptors and senior preceptors, as well as with preceptors and senior preceptors themselves.
While an in-person meeting was initially scheduled by the committee for March 2020 to solicit feedback from preceptors, this meeting had to be cancelled due to Covid-19 and was replaced with an online survey.
Michaela J. Thompson, a preceptor in Environmental Science and Public Policy, said the report appears to consider preceptors “almost as an afterthought.”
“That’s clearly not a substitute for an actual face-to-face meeting where you hear grievances and suggestions from a category of people about whom you are going to make incredibly significant decisions,” Thompson said. “It doesn't seem like we’re in the report at all.”
Zipser wrote the committee’s recommendations intend “to standardize the teaching load” and ensure “preceptors’ duties are equitable.” One of the report’s proposed changes includes a new requirement for all preceptors and senior preceptors to teach four to five courses or course equivalents per year.
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this month, Gay declined to comment on specific questions about the report. She noted, however, that Faculty Affairs will implement the proposed changes over the coming year.
Sara M. Feldman, a preceptor in Yiddish, said she is “pretty skeptical” whether the report’s implementation will lead to substantial changes that resolve long-standing areas of contention between administrators and non-tenure track faculty, given that the report reaffirms the existing term caps on preceptors and senior preceptors.
“Really there’s nothing specific in here besides reaffirming the way things already are,” Feldman said.
CORRECTION: March 16, 2021
A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the report recommends all preceptors and senior preceptors be required to teach four to five courses or course equivalents per semester. In fact, the recommendation is to require teaching four to five courses or course equivalents per year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students anticipated their third wellness day Tuesday, some said Harvard’s policy to designate course-free days interspersed throughout the spring semester is ineffective, even if well-intended.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced last fall that FAS would not hold a spring break in 2021 to minimize travel due to the Covid-19 pandemic and would instead designate five “wellness days,” each held on different days of the week, throughout the spring semester.
Hayden Teeter ’24 said he spent the first two wellness days, which bookended weekends, “relaxing.” He will spend this week’s wellness day, though, preparing for a Wednesday midterm.
“I have to spend tomorrow just studying — so not really what I had in mind for a wellness day,” Teeter said.
Neil K. Khurana ’22 said he has a significant assignment due Wednesday, and though he asked his professor to consider pushing the due date to Thursday so that he and his classmates could more fully enjoy the wellness day, his professor declined.
To make matters worse, Khurana said, the course will not hold office hours Tuesday due to the wellness day, even though it usually holds sessions the day before a major assignment’s due date.
“On wellness days they cancel the office hours, which obviously makes sense,” he said. “TFs need some time off too.”
“But it doesn’t make sense that you’re going to have an assignment due the day after a wellness day if you’re canceling the most popular office hours the night before it’s due,” he added.
Austin D. Goldsmith-Lachut ’22 said, though he understands Harvard’s decision to forgo spring break to limit travel, he does not think it makes sense to have wellness days “randomly placed throughout the week.” He added he will spend Tuesday’s day off writing a paper due the next day.
“I don’t think they’re restful,” Goldsmith-Lachut said. “I think it was initially well-intended, but a big flop in the end.”
Goldsmith-Lachut also said he believes the irregular wellness day schedule is “disturbing” many course curricula. Instead of scrapping this week’s readings from the syllabus, a professor for his seminar, which will not meet Tuesday in observance of the wellness day, assigned the week’s readings as “optional.”
“There’s reading on the syllabus for this week but it’s optional, but we’re going to discuss it [next week],” Goldsmith-Lachut said. “It was expected that I do this reading — and kind of an informal violation of the policy.”
Some students said they believe Harvard should have taken a firmer stance on when assignments can be due after a wellness day occurs.
“No assignment should be due the day after a wellness day — that should have just been a blanket rule,” Khurana said.
Some students also said wellness days are an inadequate substitute for a traditional week-long spring break.
Joanna Boyland ’23 said she would have preferred a spring break, noting that wellness days do not pause weekly academic expectations.
“A lot of the classes have sort of a weekly rhythm and so when there’s a day off, it doesn’t really give you time off from that week’s set of assignments,” Boyland said. “I still have most of my homework, which is the real time commitment, still to do. And so it doesn’t as much feel like a break."
Teeter said wellness days, unlike spring break, do not provide adequate respite from coursework.
“It’s just more time to do homework essentially,” he said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on student criticisms.
Though some students said wellness days are an insufficient replacement for spring break, Chukwudi M. “Chudy” Ilozue ’24 said he believes the dispersed days off are both restorative and prudent.
“The extra days really are helpful,” Ilozue said. “The wellness days give intermittent grace, which is really what is the most useful in a time like this.”
“Spring break is not a Thanksgiving or Christmas,” he added.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a January interview that the College is taking wellness days and related student feedback “very seriously.”
“The Office of Undergraduate Education stressed that no courses should be held on these days, whether synchronously or asynchronously, and that faculty should not assign work to be due on those days,” Khurana said. “And that faculty should set deadlines for assignments either before or after the wellness days in such a way that students can take full advantage of the days off.”
Khurana also acknowledged courses might implement wellness days differently depending on their curriculum.
“Faculty should clearly communicate how they’re handling due dates close to the wellness days to their students in advance,” he said.

At this point, we pretty much have already formed our opinions about Wellness Days and their (or lack thereof) effectiveness. However, I gotta admit, back on Feb. 5, the first-ever Wellness Day, I had very high hopes for a restful and relaxing day where I could just chill in bed all day without giving a single thought about deadlines. The reality, however, was not as nice. Now that we’re back for yet another supposed day of wellness, enjoy a walk down memory lane through our first-ever Wellness Day.

2 a.m.: Surprise! Time to Pack 
Just when I thought I struck gold by getting a suite in Grays, aka “The Harvard Hilton,” the living situation ended up not ~quite~ working out. Hence, at the end of only my second week on campus, my suitemate and I found ourselves packing up our recently-unpacked suitcases to prepare for our move to Matthews.
8 a.m.: Outside of Matthews
The move began with us standing outside of Matthews for 10 minutes, waiting for our ID card to be activated so we could actually come into the building. However, we had no time to chill — with 11 suitcases and multiple small bags between my suitemate and me, it took a few additional hours to move everything out of Grays and towards Matthews.
11 a.m.: Bed Sweet Bed
Sure, the bed was kinda dusty, and I was too tired to unpack my stuff and put the sheet on the mattress, but by that point, I was too happy for a chance to finally lie down than to complain.
1 p.m.: Attempted to Unpack
Yes, attempted. As of this moment, I still have half my stuff in my suitcase, and the common room has pretty much become a permanent storage place, rather than, you know, an actual common room. Oh well, with Covid, it’s not like we’ll need the space to party anyway.
2 p.m.: Let the Zoom's Begin
To be fair, I really did not have class that Friday. Unfortunately, with the pandemic, everything moves online. That means club meetings, interviews, meetings with mentors and advisors, etc. are all Zoom. I wonder if the people I saw on Zoom could notice the dead look in my eyes.
4:30 p.m.: Mass General Hospital
At 4:30 p.m. sharp, I ventured outside for the 10th time that day to head to Massachusetts General Hospital. But for good reasons! A friend of mine was getting the Covid-19 vaccine, and they had asked me to go with them for moral support. It was the closest I’ve gotten to a vaccine yet. Alas.
7 p.m.: Annenberg
We got back just in time for dinner! And like most Fridays, HUDS was having their delicious New England Clam Chowder! Yummy. Will it ever be the same as actual sit-down meals in Annenberg? Maybe not. But it was just the ~wellness meal~ I needed.
9 p.m.: Sleep! 
Woo!
11 p.m.: Sike!
Just kidding, I forgot that I had an assignment due at midnight. Wellness Day who?
February 6, 2021
12:05 a.m.: Sleep (For Real This Time!)
I was so tired I practically passed out.
Yeah, my first-ever Wellness Day was not very restful, but at least I now know to adjust my expectations for our next Wellness Days. Does today’s feel somehow even sadder knowing that we would usually have spring break right now? Of course. I promise I wouldn’t go anywhere! Just let me sleep for a week! Please!
