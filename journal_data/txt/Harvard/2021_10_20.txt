After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“One of the secrets of a happy life is continuous small treats, and if some of these can be inexpensive and quickly procured so much the better.” — Iris Murdoch
As a student at Harvard, one quickly finds that the most important opinion you can have is which dining hall is the best. The selection criteria for this are varied: Some look only at the quality of the food, some the “vibes” of the seating area, and others still how true the dining hall is to an authentic “Harvard feel.” An often-overlooked metric is the style of tray returns. Given that the Houses have all undergone a series of renovations throughout the past several decades, one might, mistakenly, think that a standardized tray return would have emerged.
Alas, in Adams we have a standard conveyor built, seemingly like Lowell’s where there are hooks and a start-stop indexing system. These should not be confused with Quincy’s which is open-air or Dunster’s where you place the tray on a shelf that rotates into the back. This seemingly small feature illustrates a massive difference in engineering solutions throughout the House dining halls.
I have spent many a meal imagining the reason for such differences. The most amusing of these imaginings is that the House Dean or House Restoration Committee of each House had incredibly strong opinions about how the tray returns should be. I imagine angry demonstrations, trays thrown, hooks demanded, shelves balked at. Another reason might be sourced from biologists Gould and Lewontin’s “Spandrel argument.”
For those not acquainted with architecture and/or organismic biology, spandrels are the triangular space between the top of an arch and the rectangular frame. The argument in evolutionary biology was leveraged against the adaptationist program as showing that some characteristics are in fact a byproduct of the evolution of other characteristics or, in the case of spandrels, other architectural decisions. Some might argue that embracing the irrelevant led to Gould and Lewontin’s theory.
This notion of evolutionary, or in our case, engineering byproduct, falls short when digging into the speciation of tray returns at Harvard. It is not clear, after all, whether the designs can be laid in a sequential order, or whether they were influenced by each other in any way. There is a larger question that they bring up in their unimportance: Why on earth are we talking about them?
The best reason I can provide is that it is important to notice small things. And not just notice them, but find fascination in them. If you have enough fascination for something, you may even begin to derive joy from observing it. If you are forced to think of the best, funniest conversations that you have had in the past month, the ones where you laughed the hardest; made your friends embarrassed to be sitting with you in the dining hall due to the scene you caused; which ones do you remember most vividly?
I am willing to bet that the memory you will come up with does not involve discussing something serious. There will not be a whiff of interviews, applications, problem sets, relationship drama. Instead, the discussion will have been on how to explain Hegel to kindergarten students (and whether or not they know what a dialectic is). Or a heated debate on whether or not sprinkles are good. Or even, sometimes, just maybe, why there are so many different kinds of tray returns?
Returning to our opening quotation, the goal that Murdoch sets out for us is to find small treats that can quickly be procured. What is more inexpensive and quickly procurable than a discussion with a friend? A, hopefully humorous, shared obsession over something nonsensical. A degree of whimsy is a necessary addition to life might be an apt rephrasing of Murdoch’s advice.
The disagreeable reader may find the advice up to this point to be rather childish. “Let’s get serious!” they might exclaim. To those readers, I ask, have you ever met a child? What happy people! Not yet forced to confront the world with its host of issues. Instead, able to apply rich imaginative faculties to the most mundane of situations: think a rubber ducky and bath time. For those still unconvinced, I ask that you listen to Frank Sinatra’s Young at Heart. He expresses the importance of a childlike view better than I ever could.
The takeaway here is not that you should become obsessed with tray returns. Nor should you develop a staunch opinion on whether Hegel can be taught to kindergarten students. Instead, I hope that you will attempt to find something silly to develop a position towards. Something of not much consequence. This should not be in place of important positions and attitudes, but should act as a calming agent. Something to bring a smile when the day has been spent on more serious matters. An inexpensive, quickly procured treat of your own choosing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beyond Harvard’s emphasis on inclusion and diversity, many of its students still have a long way to go to realize that people with disabilities are people beyond our disabilities.
In a conversation with a guy I met recently amidst the craziness of the first week of freshman year, one question continued to reemerge. “Have you been in a serious relationship?” he asked me. As he would later explain to me, his surprise had more to do with the fact that a person with a disability was in a relationship rather than the fact that I, as a person, had been able to experience what a large number of young people our age have already experienced.
These kinds of reactions are not new to me. As a blind person, I am all too accustomed to being seen as an inspiration, as someone to be helped, as “the blind girl” rather than “the girl who likes to play the piano and loves morning walks.”
For many of us, having a disability eclipses, at least for those who don’t know us, any aspect of our character that in a non-disabled person would naturally draw attention. Our task is to make these people want to look beyond by talking about disability and showing that it is nothing taboo and strange, or anything more than, in my case, a pair of eyes that don’t work.
In such a visual world where the very random conversations people talk about at Annenberg start with a smile or an exchange of glances, I sometimes have a hard time facing people, putting myself out there and trying to be seen. At a university where the dating culture is based more on a visual environment (smiling at the person you’re interested in from around the corner at a party), sometimes I can’t help but think that, for me, the situation is always going to be different. But it shouldn’t have to be.
In my town, exposure to the realities of people with disabilities was always pretty low. The fact that people saw my disability as an insurmountable barrier rather than seeing it for what it is — one more difference that in the grand scheme of things that does nothing more than bring a new perspective to life — seemed normal to me.
When I came to Harvard, however, I thought things would be different. When applying to college, I imagined Harvard as a group of open-minded people who are not only different but who also accept and find beauty in each other’s differences. But in the end, that’s not exactly what I’ve come across.
Beyond the image of inclusivity that the University advertises on its admissions website, I was never told that the unfamiliarity and fear of the unknown here would still be so present.
It manifests in the conversations I never got to have because I could not see people to talk to randomly and no one dared to approach me. It’s evident when someone dares to utter a question including the word “blind” and in its many euphemisms — sometimes with fear, sometimes with inspiration — that, most of the time, they think will be offensive but, in reality, almost never is. It reveals itself in the surprise that many have when they discover that I like to party, that I go to the movies and that I have a normal life, and embedded in the question “do you need help?” which is always appreciated, but which I sometimes wish came off as something more … human. Something closer, more real, and not just a one-sided transaction where I get help and the other person feels good for helping me. Because I, as a person, am much more than that.
I am Milagros — lover of coffee (but not the kind they serve in the dining hall) and community service, terrible player of Uno, and writer of songs you can definitely sing in the shower. And beyond that, yes, I am blind. I am not an inspiration, nor an example. I make more mistakes than I could count in a day, and their number is amplified when the weekend rolls around.
My disability does not prevent me from having a normal life, personal agency, and interests that have nothing to do with it. And if you ever ask me, no, I would not date a blind person. I would date a person — nice, with a good sense of humor, who has a pleasant voice — and who, perhaps, happens to be blind. And I would give anything for everyone to think that way.

Dear aspiring leaders and those who will choose them,
I am writing this during the spookiest part of October for Crimson editors — The Turkey Shoot. That time-old tradition when the paper’s outgoing leadership chooses their replacements on the masthead for the following year. This piece is my advice for my peers currently seeking roles at any level or for the future young, passionate, idea-full, collegiate journalists who wish to sit at the helm of this “storied” organization.
We are on the cusp of a 150th anniversary — the nation’s oldest continuously published college newspaper. Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy were editors here before leading us out of the Great Depression and Cuban Missile Crisis. Our walls have effectively run out of space to hang our journalistic accolades, and we have lined our halls with the faces of the more than 30 Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists who used to stroll through them.
I could go on, but I take it for granted, aspiring and departing leaders, that you already knew all that. We all heard this information at our first open houses, and we publish it on our website today. Instead, what you must know and use to critically inform your work are precisely those parts of our organization’s story which I cannot take for granted that you already know. The parts that we regret and, perhaps, would prefer to forget today are nonetheless an integral part of The Crimson’s story that intimately affect what we do.
As Chair of the Diversity and Inclusivity Committee this past year, part of my work naturally centered on improving our historic lack of diversity. This issue hastily leads to investigating why there is an anti-Crimson stigma among communities of color on Harvard’s campus.
In digging for the roots of anti-Crimson stigma, I found patterns in many of those regrettable moments I mentioned that inform some crucial recommendations I will make today.
In the 1970s, right after Harvard started admitting Black students in any numbers big enough to form a community, The Crimson Editorial Board published editorials saying the College should not lower admissions standards for the social good and criticized the Black Students Union for stating that the organization was only open to Black students. Already, Lee A. Daniels ’71, a Crimson editor at the time, noted that “distrust that was racial in origin” was the most accurate descriptor for Black students’ attitudes toward The Crimson.
In 1981, The Crimson published a picture that contained prison-style bars superimposed over a pair of Black students. Though the image’s creator claimed it was a mistake, this resulted in a $480,000 lawsuit backed by the Black Students Association settled out of court. The Crimson paid an undisclosed sum, promised to cover minorities more, and capitalize the word “Black” as I’ve done here when referencing race.
In 1992, an editorial was published in the paper calling for the resignation of Allen S. Counter as director of the Harvard Foundation. In the wake of this by The Crimson’s admission, “almost every cultural group” expressed support for Counter, and the ensuing controversy raised tensions so high that interventions from the president of the University and police patrols around The Crimson’s building were necessary.
I could go on, but you are likely to have at least heard of the more contemporary racial and ethnic controversies. The crucial problem is perhaps best encompassed by a question that Cheryl R. Devall ’80, an executive in the ’80s, had back then: “Why can’t the people on the paper understand the anger that the people at BSA are bringing?”
The anti-Crimson stigma that has previously weakened the breadth and depth of our coverage due to the voices that have not been in the newsroom exists because The Crimson’s leadership has historically not sufficiently endeavored to understand why it is there in the first place. And this is not only exemplified by the recurring racial controversies over the last five decades, but by the simple fact that the role of “Chair of Diversity and Inclusivity Committee” did not exist until 2015.
Hence, I give you, the Turkey Shooters and their deliberators, the following prescriptions:
First, we ought to consider only those who have demonstrated a thoughtful commitment to Diversity and Inclusion as fit for leadership — at any level — and the rest should not be able to make the cut. A “thoughtful commitment” cannot begin and end in a pitch during the Turkey Shoot. The character of shooters’ entire tenure at The Crimson should demonstrate investment in D&I.
Second, the work of the D&I Committee must be further institutionalized. Many professional newspapers have a person on their masthead dedicated to inclusion — we should too. I go as far as to say that The Crimson’s traditional “Big Three” — President, Managing Editor, Business Manager — should be a Big Four, including an Inclusion Chair.
The value of these steps is partly symbolic — and symbols do matter. Further centering inclusion in how we define our leadership will have a meaningful effect on how people construe their roles at all times. But it is also more than that — it is aggressively practical and necessary.
This decade-upon-decade cycle of controversy following questionable editorial choices, reinforced by a lack of institutional memory, will not end passively — we have tried passive. It failed. Time will not heal past wounds; thoughtful actions might. It will take a conscious effort from those with decision-making power to break the cycle, and these ideas are an essential start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirteen City Council candidates spoke on the importance of arts and culture in Cambridge and their plans to support and respond to the needs of the arts sector at a virtual forum Tuesday night.
The forum was hosted by Create the Vote Cambridge, a nonpartisan advocacy campaign that aims to “raise awareness and support for arts, culture, and the creative workforce” through engaging with voters and candidates, according to the campaign’s website.
The arts and culture sector is a major economic driver in Cambridge. It generates nearly $175 million and provides over 6,000 jobs according to a report released in 2017.
Many candidates noted the arts sector is underfunded despite the large economic role of arts and culture in the city. They also highlighted the pandemic’s detrimental effect on artists, musicians, street performers, and other members of the creative workforce.
“The arts are a huge key to a strong economic recovery,” Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said. “This sector was woefully underfunded pre-pandemic, and we have a tremendous opportunity to reinvest in this critical sector.”
Mallon also argued that the sources for investing can come from American Rescue Plan Act funding, the city budget, and investments from the private sector and university partners.
Other candidates such as Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80 also called for funding from local universities like Harvard — of which the endowment recently hit $53.2 billion — to support the arts and culture sector in Cambridge.
“We also need to include the universities,” Nolan said. “MIT and Harvard just literally gained billions of extra dollars on their endowment. Let's make sure that those are used by the City to more fund the arts.”
Candidates like Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler and challenger Joe McGuirk noted the vital connection between affordable housing and the art industry in Cambridge for keeping artists in the city.
“The median cost for a one bedroom apartment is $2,200 a month in Cambridge and the median cost to buy is more than $800,000, and that has a huge impact on artists and musicians who are getting priced out of the city,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said. “We’re also losing affordable artists' working spaces.”
McGuirk had a similar sentiment.
“People who make our lives better by performing art in the city — they should have the opportunity to live here as well,” he said.
Challenger Burhan Azeem said that if elected, he would focus on the Central Square area as an avenue for expanding Cambridge as a hub for arts and culture. He added that the pandemic caused many renters to abandon Central Square, leaving many vacancies that can be utilized for arts-related development.
“If Central Square is going to the next hub that really changes, then we should change it in a way that's far better and really lives up to this designation as a cultural district,” he said.
First-time candidate Frantz Pierre discussed the importance of supporting Cambridge’s youth to succeed in the arts.
“I think it's time that we get the kids in Cambridge a true chance to succeed,” he said.

Brenda D. Tindal, the new executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, shared her vision for the HMSC and her passion for museums, community engagement, and civic dialogue during a virtual fireside chat Tuesday evening.
The event was moderated by Susan J. Thompson, HMSC’s director of institutional advancement, who began by asking Tindal about her role as a public historian.
Tindal explained that her interest in history began at a young age.
“My father always tells a story of when my parents would be looking for us to gather us for dinner,” she reflected. “My dad would always say, ‘Just go check, she’s curled up with a book somewhere!’”
Tindal also described a pivotal moment that piqued her historical curiosity: in the 10th grade, her debate coach asked her to read and research an 1851 speech by Sojourner Truth entitled “Ain’t I A Woman?”
During the event, Tindal launched into an impassioned imitation of Truth, reciting the entire speech from memory.
“‘Ain’t I a Woman’ was almost like a compass through which I began to reimagine and develop a new vocabulary around history,” Tindal said.
Thompson then inquired about Tindal’s career trajectory. Tindal said that in 2003, as an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, a professor encouraged her to pursue an internship at the Levine Museum of the New South, which she came to view as a “critical juncture” in her career.
“It was the first time that I understood the power of museums — the power to not only be a place to come and engage and learn, and a place of enrichment, but also a place that invited community members to have deeper and nuanced conversations about their communities and to mobilize and activate communities,” she said.
In an interview following Tuesday’s event, Tindal said that at Harvard, she would continue the community engagement efforts that drew her to museums early in her career, including surrounding the recent legal and ethical criticisms of Harvard museums’ handling of Native American human remains and cultural objects, the remains of possibly enslaved individuals, and photos of enslaved people.
“Museums across the country, including Harvard, are engaged in really deep and important conversations, some of which include how can we be better stewards of, and engage in more ethical stewardship as it relates to, collections that have very sensitive stories, very complex narratives, and very complex acquisition narratives tied to them,” she said.
“Not only do we have to think about ethical stewardship, we also have to think about descendant community engagement,” Tindal added.
Tindal concluded the event by expressing her eagerness to adopt her new role at the HMSC, which she began on May 17.
“I’m excited to roll up my sleeves and to figure out how we reimagine what community engagement looks like in the aftermath of a pandemic,” she said. “We can ensure that there's not a poverty of imagination around how we do what we know how to do best — and that is to promote discovery and engagement, and really activate science and culture for diverse audiences.”

A group of scholars of Latin American politics and law discussed the threats to judicial independence posed by populist leaders in Brazil, El Salvador, and Mexico in a virtual discussion Tuesday hosted by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
The discussion — titled “Populism and the Courts in Latin America”— was moderated by Government professor and Co-Chair of the Center Steven Levitsky. Its panel featured Lilliam Arrieta, a law professor at the Central American University of El Salvador; Julio Ríos-Figueroa, an associate law professor at ITAM in Mexico; Diego Werneck Arguelhes, an associate law professor at Insper in São Paulo, Brazil; and Gretchen Helmke, a professor of political science at the University of Rochester.
Arrieta said Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and the Nuevas Ideas party have unconstitutionally removed five supreme court justices without procedure in May and forced over 150 judges into early retirement in August, as part of a broader attack on the Salvadoran court system. She also noted how communication from the government is important to populists.
“[Populists] do not speak to the people. They do not speak with the people. They speak for the people,” Arrieta said. “What they want to convey is the message that they are the people, and this particular trait has been abused by our president and by his representatives in Congress.”
Ríos-Figueroa discussed how Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has used the power of the executive branch and his party’s large majorities in Mexico’s legislature to similarly attack the courts. He said it is uncertain whether the Mexican courts have lost their function as a check on the government.
“The coin is still in the air,” Ríos-Figueroa said. “We’ll figure it out in the next three years.”
Arguelhes argued that in Brazil, the courts have effectively stood up to the government of President Jair Bolsonaro, particularly on issues of political corruption and the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the Brazilian justice system has endured due to Bolsonaro’s failure to use executive power during the pandemic, the court’s criminal investigations into Bolsonaro and his allies, and the reluctance of the congress to attack the courts.
“He has mainstreamed illiberal positions on the separation of powers, that’s true,” Arguelhes said. “But so far he has been unable to curb, pack or reform the courts. And moreover inside the courts, no other president since democratization has suffered so many defeats in judicial hands.”
Levitsky said in an interview with The Crimson that lessons from the study of populism in Latin America can be applied to former United States President Donald Trump. He compared the situation in the United States to that in Brazil, where the court system was under pressure to enable the president’s agenda but managed to maintain its independence.
“You had a populist leader who screamed at the courts at times, who insulted judges, and who often subverted the law, but who lost in the courts a lot,” Levitsky said of Trump. “Even conservative courts, even judges he appointed, at times constrained him.”
In the discussion, Helmke noted Latin America continues to serve as a hotbed of populist, authoritarian political movements.
“Scholars who are studying other parts of the world really need to pay attention to Latin America to try to understand this phenomenon of democratic erosion,” she said.

The Computer Science department appointed seven new faculty members in a cluster hire, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences announced Monday.
The new faculty members will join the SEAS campus in Allston between January 2022 and September 2023 to strengthen Harvard’s work in “emerging frontiers” of computer science, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum engineering, and data science.
“The additions will strengthen and diversify research, teaching, and scholarship in Harvard’s highly interdisciplinary program,” the SEAS statement read.
Computer Science Area Chair Eddie Kohler said the new appointments were not part of a coordinated effort per se, but that the added expertise in AI and machine learning will further Harvard’s exploration of emerging fields in computer science.
“[The new appointments] are just an awesome group of individuals in different areas that all happen to be arriving in pretty close proximity to one another,” he said. “We think that together, they’re going to really help bring the most current AI and ML research to Harvard students and help Harvard impact the field more broadly.”
SEAS had already announced one member of the cluster hire, Fernanda Viégas, in November 2020. Viegas, who will join the department in spring 2022, formerly worked at Google, where she co-led the company’s “People + AI Research” initiative.
Another faculty member, Yannai A. Gonczarowski, spent six years at Google as a software engineer and joined this fall as an assistant professor in both Computer Science and Economics.
Gonczarowski, who holds both a Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science and a M.Sc. in classical singing from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, focuses his research on the interaction between economics, computer science, and game theory.
Sham Kakade, a machine learning expert at the University of Washington, will begin in January 2022 as the Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science with a joint appointment in the Department of Statistics.
“We can really make a push to more interesting AI-related goals because the bottom line is, the world’s a pretty exciting place right now,” he said.
Also joining in January as an assistant professor is Anurag Anshu, who is currently a postdoctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley. Anshu, who works in quantum computing, will be an addition to Harvard’s new program in quantum science and engineering, which SEAS announced in April.
Anshu said he believes Harvard “appreciates the depth of quantum computing – they appreciate the theory behind it.”
The two other new appointments, Sitan Chen and David Alvarez-Melis, also do research in theoretical and applied machine learning, respectively.
Like Anshu, Chen, who will come to Harvard in fall 2023 as an assistant professor, is also a postdoctoral student at Berkeley. His work focuses on the intersection of machine learning and theoretical computer science.
Alvarez-Melis, who specializes in applied machine learning, will join both the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics departments. His work involves making machine learning more relevant to natural and medical sciences, among other applications with more limited data.
Jonathan Frankle, who recently finished his Ph.D. at MIT, will also join as an assistant professor of Computer Science starting in fall 2023. Frankle works on understanding the behavior of neural networks, which he said are “a hot thing in computer science these days.”
Frankle said his new position at Harvard has a special significance after his past rejections by Harvard.
“Harvard has rejected me three times now at various points in my career — for undergrad and twice for grad school, so it's nice to get the last laugh on that,” Frankle said.
Frankle added that he is excited to join Harvard to do research in a young but rapidly developing field that he recognizes has been “a big area of interest.”
“I want everyone to know that a lot of exciting folks are coming to join, exciting folks are already there, and we hope to build something really great,” he said.

Legal and policy experts debated strategies to protect private data on platforms including Facebook, Google, and Twitter in a virtual panel hosted Tuesday by the Berkman Klein Center, a University-wide research center that studies challenges posed by the internet.
The discussion marked the premier event hosted by the Institute for Rebooting Social Media, a three-year “pop-up” research group founded “to accelerate progress towards addressing social media’s most urgent problems,” per its website. Over the three years, the institute will invite scholars across disciplines to weigh in on the debate.
Tuesday’s webinar featured Stanford Law School professor Nathaniel Persily; Nabiha Syed, the president of the tech-focused newsroom the Markup; former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer Nicole Wong; and Ethan Zuckerman, the director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts.
Harvard Law School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain, who moderated the panel, said the institute is joining “an already really rigorous effort” to regulate social media companies and determine who should have access to users’ private data.
Drawing from their diverse backgrounds, panelists envisioned “data-driven oversight of social media” and exchanged ideas about how to safeguard the public interest.
The panel occurred weeks after former Facebook data scientist and whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress. Haugen turned over internal Facebook research to The Wall Street Journal that revealed Instagram and Facebook’s harmful effects on society.
Persily, the Stanford professor, who has worked at Facebook for the past five years, kicked off the panel by offering an insider perspective. He said he drafted legislation that called for a federally-mandated system administered by the Federal Trade Commission that would compel social media companies to share data with outside experts in exigent circumstances.
“We cannot live in a world where the only people who have the insights on what is most of human experience right now are those who are tied to the profit-maximizing efficiency of these firms,” Persily said. “I became convinced that government regulation is really the only answer here.”
Speaking from her experience as a journalist, Syed urged viewers to be skeptical of reports put out by tech companies on their own services. Instead, she suggested independent researchers and journalists solicit data from social media consumers to conduct their own studies.
Zuckerman, the UMass professor, said he favors a combination of third-party research and government regulation of big tech. He cited YouTube as an instance in which third-party research is insufficient.
“YouTube is surprisingly understudied despite the fact that it’s enormously influential,” Zuckerman said. “That’s because it’s a pain in the ass to study. You have to grab the videos, transcribe them, and do text analysis on them.”
The government could solve that problem by forcing YouTube to turn over internal data.
Wong, the former U.S. official, contextualized the challenges posed by social media regulation.
“We’re early in the regulatory process,” Wong said. “What you see our policy makers struggling with is that they’re not sure what they’re regulating because it is different to regulate privacy versus human rights verses misinformation.”
Wong proposed a multi-layered approach to balance increasing transparency with protecting users’ privacy. According to Wong, consumers, journalists, and researchers should have access to select information depending on the level of sensitivity.
Though she believes some tech companies are engaging with the public in good faith, Wong said others — notably Facebook — are obscuring issues with their tech to prioritize their brand at the expense of the public’s interest.
“There are some companies out there that are genuinely trying to be upfront,” Wong said. “They can get into the honest conversation: So what’s the system we’re supposed to be building?”
Others choose to mislead and promote a narrative that she called “toxic positivity.”

In its last non-conference matchup of the season, Harvard built an early lead and never looked back. The Crimson ran up 30 points while keeping Lafayette out of the end zone in the 30-3 win. At 5-0 (2-0 Ivy League), the Crimson will travel to Princeton, N.J., this weekend for a tilt with the also undefeated Tigers that may prove to be a pivotal turning point in the Ivy season, and maybe even a de facto championship game.

Dean Khurana may be known for his friendly smile, quirky Instagram posts, and level of energy he puts towards supporting Harvard undergraduates, but did you know that on the side he’s actually a ~fire~ playlist curator? Keep reading to see how we ranked his most *popping* playlists:
1. Welcome Home Harvard 
With a whopping 78 likes, it’s no surprise the Welcome Home Harvard playlist easily dubs first place. We love the fun and goofy mood that Dean Khurana was in when combining High School Musical’s “We're All in this Together” and Diddy's “Coming Home.” Currently admiring Dean Khurana for not only inspiring us through leadership, but also music taste. Listen to “Cheeseburger In Paradise” to confuse you more than that Stat 110 pset. After a year and a half away from home, we appreciate the sentimentality.
2. Move-In Day 
2016? What a throwback! We love to see the musical diversity and nostalgic vibes coming through on Dean K’s first playlist. Some big jams that we can never forget from 2016 are featured, like tracks from Hamilton, “Ugly Heart” by G.R.L (okayy channeling BBE), and “Come On Eileen?” We’re pretty sure this is the third time we’ve seen that song featured in these playlists so far…
3. The Playlist with No Title 
Artistic boldness should be rewarded. This playlist has some big bops, but is ranked number three because it lacks a name :( We wished we had some type of title to explain Dean Khurana’s combinations of Drake with…John Denver??? On second thought, how do you title a playlist like this?
4. Harvard-Yale Playlist (most recent)
Nothing ever perks up a Harvard student’s attention more than “Free Jefes” and “Harvard-Yale.” We did the math, 22 percent of Dean Khurana’s playlists are dedicated to Harvard-Yale. With one even titled #BeatYale, we love the feistiness! What’s more Harvard than listening to a Harvard playlist by the Harvard Dean on your way to Harvard-Yale? However, we ranked it fourth because of song repeats from previous playlists – Dean K we need ~more spice~.
5. Harvard College Playlist – Pt. 1
Coming in at number five, we have this truly, extremely Harvard playlist. With some absolute BOPS (gotta love supporting our awesome arts groups on campus!), this is sure to give you a healthy dose of school spirit as you pass that tourist lovingly caressing John Harvard’s foot. Some points lost for no part two – maybe it’s time to update? Or better yet, now that in-person shows are back, go check out these arts groups in real time!
6. Pro and Con: The Valentine Playlist
Damn. Really getting at the heart (*wink wink*) of the issue. Who needs Love It/Hate It: Valentine’s Day – simply listen to this playlist and let your ears decide if Valentine’s Day is worth the hype. Dean Khurana, we have to know: is Valentine’s Day a pro or con? It may not be his best playlist of all time, but it’s certainly one that leaves us asking, “Who hurt you?”
7. Mid-Summer Playlist
Are you a true Spotify playlist aficionado if you don’t have at least one iconic summer playlist? This mid-summer playlist ranks a good bit lower than DJ Khurana’s other musical endeavors, but with a good variety of throwbacks and 2019 favorites (love the Maggie Rogers!), it’s still sure to be a crowd pleaser.
8. Socially-Distant Karaoke Playlist
Closing out our rankings, we have another one of Dean Khurana’s more recent playlists. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, social opportunities can be few and far between – what’re you to do but host your own socially distant karaoke night? We can only assume these must be the songs that Rakesh himself is ready to belt out at a moment’s notice. Just one question remains: why weren’t we invited?? Alas, maybe next time we can join in and perhaps even be featured on the Insta
Bonus: Playlists Nov. 2016 - May 2018
What we like to call, the Cassette Collection: these custom image covers add some special flare to already great playlists. Who knew Dean K was a graphic design king, too?
What can you learn about someone from their Spotify playlists? Apparently, that they love “Come On Eileen” and creating ambitious mash-up’s of “22” by Taylor Swift and “Party Rock Anthem.” Dean Khurana, keep those playlists coming – we can only aspire for our playlists to be as good as yours!
...and with Halloweekend coming up, be sure to get into the spooky spirit with yet another timely playlist from our favorite personal DJ!
